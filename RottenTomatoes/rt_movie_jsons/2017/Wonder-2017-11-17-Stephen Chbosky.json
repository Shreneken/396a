Besides is my favourite movie. What i like most about wonder is that the main character evolves though the movie,his way of coping with problems .I think that the film has characters that are not given the importance they deserve and i don't like that(as his mother or his sister)since their  problems become smaller because everything turns to the problems of the main characters.\n\nTo sum up i love it the way the movie ends.The teaching that the movie conveys is the way of showing viewers that everything can have a solution. Personally i recommended the movie 80%.",

There's certainly a fair amount of food for thought, as it were. Unsurprisingly, it is quite sad and sentimental, although I'm glad to say that I didn't feel it was unnecessarily piled in sugary sweet emotions - it focusses on the childs difficulties starting at a public school and his reaction to being made fun of for his looks. I suppose it is perhaps a little predictable but I thought that it wasn't as tacky as it perhaps could have come across and also I thought that the main cast did pretty well in their respective roles, especially Jacob Tremblay as the main character, August aka Auggie and Julia Roberts as his mum. It deals with bullying, fear/shame and so on - important topics for adolescents certainly.\n\nWould I recommend it? yes I would.",

It was starring Jacob Tremblay, Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Izabela Vidovic, Noah Jupe, and Daveed Diggs. Taking place in the heart of Brooklyn, New York a little boy with a medical condition tries to navigate through the hardships of his new school and life itself. \n\nAuggie's admirations to space really stood out to me in the film because he used space as an escape from reality. Every time Auggie needed a way to cope with a hard time, he would combine his imagination with space and would instantly feel better about his day. Correlating to space, he would use his astronaut helmet as a comfort item, for example when he started his first day of school, he wanted his helmet. \n\n        My overall reaction to the film was that it was a great way to portray what the reality of feeling/ looking different than others. This movie gave a great example that just because he looks a little different than others, doesn't mean he's not capable of doing big things. I do recommend it to my age group because it really opens your eyes to see the hardships people with medical conditions go through. Out of 5 stars i give it 4/5 stars.",

A solid drama about a kid with facial deformity and how he dealt with school. What I liked the most was how the movie was not only about the kid, but also the impact that he had on others. Things were complicated because there were actually people who cared and were affected by him. The relationship between characters within the family was endearing and heartwarming. I loved how they supported each other and never gave up on the others. \n\nJulia Roberts as the mother was amazing. Her character was more involved and the way she supported her kids made her a great character. Then, the kid's friends characters were also pretty good. I was invested in their relationship, although I have to admit it was a bit predictable. It sucks that Owen Wilson's character wasn't involved nearly as much as Julia Roberts's character although he was great in his role. \n\nAlthough it definitely put a smile on my face, I still see more potential that this movie could have gone for more impact. The sister character's friend had something going on but the movie kinda rushed it over. There's also another bully character that could have been developed more to create a more interesting plot. \n\nOverall, it's a solid movie with an inspiring message that still hit the mark, although it could have gone further. 8/10",

It was one of the assignments that I have during one of my literacy terms at which I need to finish at least one book for the five weeks term. I picked up this ocean blue cover book and started reading. \"Wonder,\" is a book that is very sensory and tasteful. It is about a middle school boy that has a facial deformity and the struggles he has to go through because of his deformity. He was home-school and is ready to attend a real school. The author is able to depict each scene and setting so realistically. When I read the book I was able to get into the characters. From the books, I get to know a lot about the main characters, Auggie, and the other characters that have a strong influence on him. The book is in the first person, so I feel like each character in the book is talking to me directly. For each character, the author lets them introduce themselves thoroughly, so I can depict and imagine what the character will look like in the movie. However, as for Auggie, there is a line from the book in his part stating that \"I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.\" So right after I finished reading the book, I couldn't wait to see the movie. I cannot wait to see what Auggie really looks like. As expected the movie brings me tears. I feel pity for the main character for all those struggles and bullies he has to go through. However, the movie shows me how strong the main character is. The movie allows me to relate to many real-life situations that we have in this society. We often overlooked those people with disabilities. They often get bullied because of how they look and how they are different from other people. One quote that really inspired me from the book and the movie is \"You can't blend in when you were born to stand out.\" We might be born with disabilities that make us look different from others; it doesn't mean we are inferior to other people. It means that we are unique and we cannot give up our uniqueness because of what other people think about us. Last but not least, I would like to suggest the book and movie to every age group. Even though the book and the movie are a bit sensitive for kids, I do this because it is a good lesson for them to learn about bullying and kindness. It could teach people to stand up against bullies and spread love.",

The film allows each character to tell their part of the story, and the audience learns how important it is for all of us to feel special. This expansion of perspectives gives everything happening on the screen a rich quality. By giving viewers a first-person glimpse of how the world looks different to characters, the audience builds empathy, which is an invaluable skill for viewers of all ages. Many of these stories closely deal with the challenges of our world. It depicts the humiliation and pain Auggie faces when he is bullied by a classmate and avoided by others just because he looks different. We recognize how many in our society\u2014people of color, immigrants, etc.\u2014are treated like a \"mysterious outsider\" and we can reflect upon how we can lessen hostility toward them. Once we see beyond the surface, we will find things we have in common and enjoy being in each other's company. I would recommend this movie to kids and adolescence to appreciate the idea that \"You can't blend in when you are born to stand out.\" Both the book and the film successfully deliver this wonderful message, but the book does a better job in capturing the differences in individuals' personalities. I would give it a 4.5/5 and highly encourage the audience to read in addition to watching the movie.",

            "content": "Wonder tells the story of a young boy, Auggie Pullman, as he enters fifth grade. He was born with extreme facial abnormalities which physically and emotionally limited him, and it's the first year he won't be homeschooled. Entering a new school and looking different than everyone else presents challenges for Auggie and his family, as he fights to find his place in a world that is less sheltered. This family/drama film came out in 2017 and is based on the bestselling book by R.J. Palacio. Directed by Stephen Chbosky, Wonder has an all-star cast including Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Jacob Tremblay, Daveed Diggs, and more. As the movie focuses on Auggie's disability, and how that affects the relationships he forms, it's clear that he finds life more difficult than a \"normal\" kid would. He is the target of isolation, bullying, and self-doubt. Wonder shows the raw moments, when a family feels tired and desperate, and how the person with the disability yearns to not be defined by it. With the odds stacked against him, Auggie is able to make friends and find a support system. There is a turning point at the field when boys who once would've bullied him stand up for him, and Auggie's able to see people are in his corner. He is empowered as he finally feels accepted \u2014 not out of pity \u2014 but because he's a cool person. Kindness prevails, and the kids who once saw him as scary or weird learn to see him as a peer and friend. One question I'm left with is whether or not the portrayal of Auggie by an actor without a disability (Tremblay) takes away from the connection with, and effect on, an audience of differently-abled viewers. The movie Wonder is empowering because it tells the story of a boy who is learning to grow up first, and his disability comes second. He still has to learn how to deal with family, friends, and the emotional roller coaster that comes with them. His disability does play a key role, but he embraces it as a part of what makes him unique. Auggie is able to understand that people don't love him despite it, they love him because of it.",

It tried to get everything from the book stuffed into this film, leading to an emotion-heavy film lacking emotion. To be honest, I felt more emotion after watching TENET, an \"emotionally devoid\" film. Reading the book, I can safely say it is one of the most emotion-packed children's books out there. Here, they crammed in a lot and did nothing with it. I felt nothing at all. Above all this, Wonder (the film) is supposed to be a character-driven story, but turns to have more plot than character. I could not stand the narration and how everything in the film is repeated at least 3 times. I do not like narration, and watching this film was like reading the book. Every line was copy-pasted into this movie, most of which is in the narration. Wonder showed something, then told it in dialogue, then repeated it in the narration for every single plot point. Many characters are set up, but very few have a decent payoff - definitely not enough for how the characters are set up. Finally, I was shocked that they cut out the 'Julian' chapter, which turned the book's events upside-down. This was the best chapter in the book, one that made me cry every time I read it. Here, they did nothing with it. Wonder could have cut out a lot to fit this in, and expand on many other storylines, but it did not. That is why I dislike this film as a book adaptation. As a film however, it is decent; worth a watch if you have not read the book. \n\nFinal rating - 53/100",

            "content": "Wonder is a dramatic-comic film of 2017 directed by Stephen Chbosky. It depicts Auggie's story ,a kid affected by a malformation of the face (played by Jacob Tremblay). \nIt's set in the modern America,which didn't bother me, but actually it has contributed to make everything more realistic. Due to his problem, he never wanted to attend the school, in fact his mother (played by Julia Roberts) gave him lessons at home. But when he had to begin the first year of the middle school, his mother, with also his father's support (Owen Wilson), decides finally to send him to school as every ''normal'' kid. And it's in the school context that problems arise because he's considered as weird and he's laughed by his classmates. Long story short, this ends up taking his revenge and becoming a real example for the entire school.\nThis movie makes the audience's heart melt. It's a film recommended  for all ages and gives an important lesson to the young people: limits can be exceeded. It also stages the theme of bullying especially on boys defined ''different'. About this aspect,I liked the way such an actual topic was managed and how it was punished.\nI loved the figure of Julia Roberts because she impeccably played the role of a mother concerned for her child. I liked the way the director could, at time, make comic such a delicate situation so as to entertain and light up the public. Furthermore what struck me was the representation of Olivia's teenage issues (like for example envy and rivalry) that really caracterize this age. In fact I identified with her chararcter and I think most of teenagers could easily do it. A thing that I didn't like were the customes. They weren't breathtaking because, excluded the Halloween celebrations, were depicted generally everyday scenes.\nDespite this story comes from the eponymous Palacio's book (that I hadn't read before watching the film), the director could stage every captable aspect of the book and highlight it without ever overdoing it. In fact also about the writing of the story, I really have nothing to say. \nIt's perfect just the way it is since the beginning to the end. Also because it's based on a true story. And it is known that the likely stories are always the most beautiful.\nOn the other hand, for me, the soundtrack could be more present in the entire film but generally it was pleasant to the ear.\nIn the end regarding the editing and the cinematographic techniques, all scenes were cut perfectly together and the narration was smoothy without any glitches. I immediately understood what moments of the day wew involved and how the story evolved over time. Flashbacks were very useful because they made everything clearer to me (for example the situation between Olivia and Miranda that I didn't understand before).\nOverall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of laughs and a dramatic story. If you're looking for a tearful and funny film that gives an important lesson, this is undoubtedly the movie for you!",

While The film obviously centres around Auggie (a boy born with a facial deformity), it explores themes we can all relate to in a world where the line between rejection and acceptance can seem very fragile indeed. We see this in the experience of other characters too, some of whom share the story from their point of view. It's a well crafted and absorbing film\u2014until the final half hour that is, which almost felt like it was produced by an entirely different set of people. Flawed characters all do 180 degree turns just in time for the film's cheesy curtain call, which stops just short of declaring that 'they all lived happily ever after'.",

Movies and TV have become so cynical and ugly these days that its often all too easy to forget the importance of being reminded - just how essential human kindness remains.  R.J.Palacio's perceptive novel has been transferred to the screen with professional production values - inviting us to look back and recall a gentler attitude and how important balanced human relationships are especially to those less fortunate than most. Its broken into segments that invite us to understand the motivations of many of its main characters and the complex intertwining relationships they have with each other -  this is done cleverly and without feeling episodic.  Some may find it too saccharine (and at times it might be) but, it still made for a refreshing change and was good to be moved to tears by an encounter with human goodness instead of human trash.  This suffering world certainly needs more, and looking at the HUGE box office returns the suffering patrons agreed!\n\nTop performances from youngsters Jacob Tremblay (Room 15) playing August (who, along with another child actor Jaeden Lieberher (The Conformation 16) bring a professional innocence to their screen characters. Lovely Izabella Vidovic is marvellous as his patient but emotionally suffering sister. Most adult roles also add to this movies special appeal.

Owen Wilson actually could have been in more scenes, he is a delight, but the rest of the cast is fine too. It's a feel good movie about values, and there is nothing wrong with that.

Like you\u00e2(TM)ll get to see from every charters perspective. But most movies don\u00e2(TM)t really point that out they just let you figure it out. I recommend this heartwarming movie for people that love to know from other people's conditions. This movie can put you through an emotional roller coaster, Happy and sad.  I know for sure you'd cry towards the end but in the beginning, you would laugh. The movie is mostly about a boy named Auggie that was born with a condition that\u00e2(TM)s called Treacher Collins Syndrome (TCM). He goes to school and feels a little insecure because he would think everyone would ask \u00e2what's wrong with your face?\u00e2? or  \u00e2you look weird!\u00e2?  Little did he know it turned out to be a great school year towards the end! I don't want to spoil it for you but he finds some true friends and you'll feel happy for him. If you haven't watched this then go to a movie theater near you or go on Netflix and start watching. You won't regret it, and you can thank me later ;)",

The story is very good and it is important to note that it is really interesting as well, it is a well-adapted story as well. Wonder is a really heartwarming movie. There were some people that gave negative critique to the fact that a person without the same disability portrayed Auggie Pullman, meaning that the people behind the movie should have used a person with real experience. To say the least, I did not mind, I thought Tremblay's performance as massively impressive for his age. I give this movie 4,5/5 stars.",

            "content": "Some films are primarily made to make you cry, some come out as annoyingly sappy, whilst being stupidly manipulative, but some really walk the surface of how to bring the emotional weight to a film made to make the audience cry. Wonder proudly walks this surface blending comedy with sadness. Firstly, if there was an Oscar for 'Best Performance By Younger Actor', Jacob Tremblay would've easily scooped up that Oscar providing us with not only the best performance by a young actor in 2017 as Auggie, but one of the best performances of 2017 all round. The supporting cast were fine as their roles but it is really the child actors and actresses that steal the show here. I'm still confused as to why Wonder didn't get that much attention at the awards because it is definitely one of the better family movies of 2017 alongside the fantastic Paddington 2, however it cannot reach the heights set by that film. Secondly, Wonder boasts a unique structure which allows the main protagonists to have scenes dedicated to them, whether it's showcases their background stories or telling the audience there feelings toward Auggie. The films works really well as Auggie is a captivating character and you can really feel sympathetic towards him and Jacob Tremblay really brings us the tears making nearly every scene with Auggie emotional. \n\nThe ending is perfect and I loved that all the way through the film that all the main characters developed. But the film isn't all sad with some lighthearted funny moments sprinkled nicely around it's run time so that the audience can still get a giggle out of the film. My only problem with the film is that some elements seem rushed and after a while the film suddenly gets rapidly quicker making it feel like it's sprinting to the end. I would of heavily liked if there was one segment that was dedicated to Julian where it shows us his true opinions and thoughts towards Auggie. But, in the end, Wonder is a great family movie which in Jacob Tremblay really shines and shows us that the lady has come a long way since his appearance in The Smurfs 2, the message is powerful even if it has been used before but the rest of the film is very good providing us with great character and story arcs and heartwarming sequences; Wonder is easily one of the most surprising film that I saw in 2017.",

Both films were full of cliches and by-the-numbers plotting, but Irene was able to stand out with some really off-the-wall humour. Unfortunately Wonder is just really predictable, and entirely too sappy. Everything goes so perfectly for every character to the point where it's almost a fantasy world. Not that the movie needed to bee seeped in realism, but when the problems of the characters don't seem that bad to start and they barely have to work for their happy endings, it's just a bit shallow. There are two entirely separate standing ovations within ten minutes of each other at the end of this movie, it's that on the noise with it's sappy endings. And unfortunately this drags down a movie that really has an exceptional cast and some decent dialogue. Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts give wonderful, heartfelt performances, and Jacob Tremblay is still an extraordinary talent. There are a lot of things to like about Wonder, and if you just want some mindless feel-good cheese, then Wonder is a pretty good way of getting it.",

            "content": "Based of the New York Times bestseller book written by Raquel Palacio, \"Wonder\" is a drama/comedy film that will make you feel touched and probably get the sensible side of you. It was directed by Stephen Chbosky and released on theaters on November 2017 on the United States. The setting of the film is in Manhattan, on the city of North River Heights, where our main character lives.\n\nThe actors who stars in this movie are Jacob Tremblay, Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Mandy Patinkin, David Diggs, Izabela Vidovic, Danielle Rose Russell,  Noah Jupe, Millie Davis, Bryce Gheisar and Elle McKinnon. They have plenty good and well known actors, for example Julia Roberts, that plays the character of Auggie mom, has won an oscar for best actress on 2000 and is a really popular actress. Auggie, the main character, is played by Jacob Tremblay, Auggie's mom is played by Julia Roberts, Auggie's dad is Owen WIlson and Aggies sister Via is played by Danielle Rose. They all give really good performances, the actings is really good, you feel like it's really happening in real life and it make you feel the emotions about what's happening.\n\nThe story is about Auggie, a boy that was born with a strange facial deformity syndrome, and due to his 27 surgeries he has been homeschooled by his mother Isabel. But when he reaches the age of secondary school they decide to inscribe him on a private preparatory called Beecher prep. When he first enters, all the kids look at him really bad, until  kid called Jack Will starts talking to him and become friends. Also there's a kid called Julian that bothers him a lot. The most curious thing of the film is that they make that every main character in the film has a fragment to explain their own point of view of the story. The plot of the movie is interesting, they have a really good idea, because it help us to get to know how is the reality of some kids.\n\nThe movie has great impressive qualities, the cinematography might not be one of the best ones out of all the movies, it's not like other movies that uses bunch of special effects, this movie doesn't use them, but the cinematography is actually really good anyway. Also one of the best things that the movie has are the soundtracks, each one is composed so it can fit in the right scene and moment, but they aren't just beautiful, they also help to transmit you in a more emotional way what are the characters feeling like and helps you understanding the atmosphere. \n\nIn a scale out of 10, i will rate the movie with an 9. The movie is really good, the actors do an amazing job, they have good qualities. I think that no one would be disappointed when watching the film, to the contrary, it can exceed your expectations. People should definitely see this movie, it's for all ages and it would make you have a really good time. Also, it has a beautiful message, it teaches you to never give up and stay strong.",

Now he must confront the stares and prejudices of his new school mates.\n\nGreat, emotional movie directed by Stephen Chbosky, who gave us the superb 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'.  Covers issues such as friendship, tolerance, acceptance and treating people non-superficially.  Also shows the effect that Auggie's issue has on his family and friends, leading to some interesting character studies, in keeping with the great character depth and development of the movie.\n\nNot perfect or revolutionary though.  The plot is fairly predictable and doesn't really go anywhere new.  I kept thinking that there was going to be a major twist to test the seemingly inevitable happy ending, but it never came.  Conclusion is quite trite and a bit dumbed-down too.  So not overly profound, despite the subject matter.\n\nThis all said, this movie is about the journey, not the destination, and it's a wonderful journey.",

However, this kind of sadism also needed the attention of my parents and I was so moved when I met my parents after the play. I almost cried at this time, but I held myself tight.

So, how do we deal with them in these situations? You may have treated them with a cynical attitude. But it is never right to ignore and discriminate them. They are also human beings like us, who can feel and express emotions. The film is 'Wonder,' which clearly shows the reason. In the movie, the main character 'August' is portrayed as a congenital handicapped man. He knew very much that he was different from others, and he managed to get along well with his family during his childhood. However, the theme of the movie begins to be shown when students face the problem of entering a school, which can be called the first step in social life. At school, he thought he couldn't fit in. In the beginning of the movie, everyone in the school paid attention to his face as he expected, and a student named Julian even looks down on him and agrees to bullying his friends. Of course, from day one, he cries out to his parents that he does not want to go to school. One day, A student Jack  approached him, who was eating lunch alone every day, and they became close friends. But when during the Halloween day that August favorites on, he sees Jack belittling his face when he is away, and he is very disappointed with Jack and stay  away from him. Over time, the conflicts between the two are resolved and become close friends again. And finally, he had many friends, and he got a prize from the principal on the day of the school graduation. The film shows the society in which disabled people are not treated well and ignored by setting them as the main characters. Also, it shows how Isabelle, the sister of the August, feels that love is monopolized and has to be excluded from such family members because of her brother. What's unique about this movie is that it varies the perspectives of the characters. This allows viewers to look at an event from various aspects, thereby reducing misunderstanding. This movie is also enough for family movies and describes the social situation we need to walk in the future. In that sense, the movie is very meaningful and I hope the world will change like this one in the future.",

While watching this movie, I thought about what it would be like if I had been a Ergy. It must have been really hard to decide to enter school after home schooling. It feels great to take a first step.\nIf I had a friend like him, I probably wouldn't approach him bravely, so I'd better not look at him as much as possible. Friends like Ergy may get a lot of attention from others.\nI envied Miranda and Bia. Although there was time when the relationship was suddenly bad, I envied Miranda's close relationship with Bia's family. I want to make a friend like them.\nThere is another feeling. I often felt like my parents cared more about my brother because he started exercising since he was young. Of course they cares about me a lot, but seemed to care more about me, but I like him, and my situation seemed to be like a relationship between Bia and Ergy. Although his parents cared more about the handicapped brother, Bia liked and took care of him a lot. Looking at it, I thought 'family is a family.'\nThis movie must be touching.

            "content": "Wonder is much more than a kid with deformities and his experience\nBased on the New York Times best-selling book of the same name by R.J. Palacio (2012), Wonder was released in November 2017. A magnificent touching story went from paper to the big screen. The story of a child with facial deformities facing the world for the first time. But this movie is not only about this kid's experience, it is about his family confronting challenges and going forward. His problems not only affect him, but also those who love him. His mom and his sister have struggles, which the story explores. Full of self-improvement and family importance, this story will leave you with some tears and with the desire to be a better person. \nWonder tells the story of a 10-year-old child with facial deformities, August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), his parents (Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson), and his older sister (Izabela Vidovic). August, or as he likes to be called Auggie, was born with these facial deformities, and with 27 surgeries it is still very noticeable. He didn't feel comfortable around other people, that's why he used to wear an astronaut helmet when going outside. Auggie has been home schooled by his mother, but now their parents have decided that it's time for him to go to a school with other children. He will be starting middle school in a real school. Auggie is afraid and very anxious; he could feel how all the people stare at him with fear and disgust basically everywhere. This is a challenge, not only for him, but also for his family. His sister Via is starting high school. She has always felt that she was the inferior priority for her parents. She understands that having a child like Auggie makes her parents focus only on him. \nThe narrative of the story jumps from one character to another, just as in the book. Some chapters are narrated by Auggie, some by Via, then by Auggie's new friend Jack, and so on. This makes the audience see multiple points of view and understand why some people do what they do. For example, we see a scene where Auggie hears Jack talking about him to other children. Auggie feels betrayed and decides not to be his friend anymore. But then, in another scene, we will discover why Jack did that and how he feels about it. \nMeanwhile, Via has her own problems. Her best friend Miranda had stopped talking to her after a summer camp. Via clearly feels alone not only in the school, but also at home. Her parents are worried about how Auggie is doing in his school. Later in the movie we will see what happened with Miranda in that summer camp and some of her own problems. \nBut Auggie and Via are not the only focus of the movie. As I said, the movie is not all about the experience of a kid with deformities, it's about a family. Auggie's mom is worried about her son. And now that she doesn't have to homeschool him, she has time to finish her studies, those that she left behind when August was born. This is a personal growth story that adds to the message of the movie, which is that self-improvement is as important as family. We also see how Julia Roberts plays a dedicated mom. She is a mom in real life and she read the book with her children. \"It was getting tricky in my house to have a nighttime chapter book everyone would like,\" she says. \"So I bought Wonder, and I could not put it down. I read it to the three kids and they were all as knocked out as I had been.\" She also said that, after reading the book, she called her agent to say that she wanted to play the mom. [ ] And that is what happened. Julia Roberts did a great job as the mom in the movie. She shows multiple emotions, such as surprise, worry, and love in the same scene, just as a mom would do.\nSteven Chbosky directed the movie. He is the author of The Perks of Being a Wallflower (1999) and he also directed the movie adaptation in 2012. He clearly has experience doing movies of this type and he did a great job with Wonder. When a book is transformed to a movie, most readers say that the book is better, or that the directors change many things from the original story. But in this case, with Wonder, there weren't a lot of changes. There had been some details omitted, but this is a matter of time. You can't fit a whole book full of details in a movie of 1 hour and 53 minutes.  \nAfter all, if you watch the movie, you will enjoy it. And my advice, is that if you haven't done it, you should definitely read the book and watch the movie. Whatever you do first, it's going to make you want to do the other. This inspiring and heart-warming story will show you how important family is. One's problem affects all the members of the family. And the whole family face challenges both individually and together, showing that self-improvement is equally important as family. This movie is not only about a kid with facial deformities and his experience, this movie is about all those around this kid. It's about family and self-improvement. Wonder will touch your heart and inspire you.\n1. https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/inspirational-stories/a46708/julia-roberts-wonder-interview/",

He is justifiably concerned that he will be mocked and have difficulty making friends; he soon learns his fears ring true. While some friendships do initially occur, they are marred by troubles due to ostracism and other forms of bullying causing the majority of his school year to be plagued by emotional pain and trauma. The rest of his family (mom, Julia Roberts still looking hot in her 50s!, dad, Owen Wilson not as goofy as his normal roles, and older sis dealing with her own school troubles) are also going through transformations in their lives, directly and indirectly caused by the changes in his. The principal of the school (Inigo Montoya) is kind, fair, and encourages Auggie. This is a very sentimental film which caused me to tear up more than once. Of course everything works out for the best, as they always do in these sort of stories. Based upon a best-selling children's novel, my daughter has enjoyed several of the author's works, but this is really not made for me.",

Stephen Chbosky perfectly illustrates this debate, which acts as a mirror for the polarised political landscape we see today. Jacob Tremblay's August Pullman is adequately developed and is our perspective in this argument. It is these parts of the film that are pulled off perfectly. However, the film occasionally stumbles when attempting explore Izabela Vidovic's Via and Julia Robert's Isabel. The relationship between the two seems unrealistic and has a rushed conclusion. Overall, Wonder's bold exploration into political territory, charming humour and (mostly) stellar cast makeup for its often bland subplots, delivering a perfect mix of social commentary and family-friendly fun.",

            "content": "Wonder\n(2017)\n\nPlot:\nBased on the beloved best-selling novel, 'Wonder' follows the inspiring story of the Pullman family, whose youngest child, Auggie (Jacob Tremblay), is a boy born with facial differences. When Auggie enters mainstream school for the first time, his extraordinary journey unites his family, his school, and his community, and proves that you can'b blend in when you were born to stand out.\n\nReview:\nAlthough this movie was extremely emotional, and the acting was top form from the whole cast, I was expecting something major to happen. The tempo that is set right from the beginning, doesn't really change but I still found it entertaining, and well written. It's based on a young boy called Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) who is born with a facial difference, which has prevented him to go to school. His loving mother Isabel (Julia Roberts) teaches him at home but she decides to enter him into the local school in the 5th grade. His father, Nate (Owen Wilson) doesn't think that it's a good idea, because he hasn't been around other kids, and he doesn't have any friends but he knows deep down that it would make or break him. At first, Auggie struggles at school with the other kids, and he feels that everyone is talking about him behind his back but he soon befriends his classmate, Jack (Noah Jupe), who helps him tackle the class bully, Julian (Bryce Gheisar). While Auggie is struggling with school life, his sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic), is also having problems at college but when she joins the drama class, she becomes close friends with another student, who eventually becomes her boyfriend. After a while, the students get used to Auggie's facial difference, and after a couple of episodes, he becomes close friends with the kids who used to bully him. It's a touching story, which proves that it's really what's inside a person, that really matters, and the fact that it's about a little kid who has a heart of gold, really does pull at the heart strings. Julia Roberts was great as the doting mum, and the chemistry between her and Owen Wilson was realistic. With that aside, it's not the type of film that you can watch time and time again, and you do have to be in the right mood to watch it but it's still worth a watch and I'm sure that audiences will feel entertained. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Stephen Chbosky, who also brought you the Perks of Being a Wallflower. He certainly got the best out of the cast, especially Jacob Tremblay who also starred in Room, alongside Brie Larson. For such a young age, 11 to be precise, he certainly put a lot of adults to shame but the storyline felt like there was something missing. As it was made from a book, I can understand that the director was trying to stay true to the original story but it would have been good to see a twist at some point. Anyway, I enjoyed the film and I would highly recommend it to people who like there emotional movies but don't expect the tempo to change.\n\nBudget: $20million\nWorldwide Gross: $300.5million\n\nGenre: Drama, Family\nCast: Owen Wilson, Julia Roberts, Jacob Tremblay, Izabela Vidovic, Mark Dozlaw, Rukiya Bernard and Mandy Patinkin. 6/10",

The non-linear narrative is very well employed and getting several points of view is a great way of understanding the different characters motivations and actions.\n\nA very typical flaw of the movie is, that the family is very idealistic and therewith quite unrealistic. In a situation like theirs, it is important to have sufficient funds for medical procedures. It is never explained why the family is so wealthy, despite the mother being unemployed and the father seemingly having a lot of time to spare for the children. The story itself does not suffer from that, but unfortunately, it makes the film a lot less credible and relatable.",

            "content": "The 2017 film Wonder, based on R. J. Palacio's novel of the same name, follows the story of Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) as he enters the fifth grade. The typical worries of entering a new grade are amplified for Auggie since it is his first year not being homeschooled. The first decade of Auggie's life was filled with dozens of surgeries to address complications due to Treacher Collins syndrome.\n\nTreacher Collins syndrome is characterized by facial differences around the eyes, ears, nose, and jawbone. These differences can cause difficulty breathing, speaking, and hearing that can usually be improved through reconstructive surgeries. 1 in 50,000 people are born with Treacher Collins syndrome and 1-2 in 1,000 are born with craniofacial differences.\n\nWith a fairly large population of affected actors to choose from, many in the disability community were disappointed and frustrated when the producers chose Jacob Tremblay to play the role. Since Tremblay is not affected by a facial difference, he was made to look disfigured with extensive makeup and had to fake a speech impediment. Tremblay did reach out to children with craniofacial differences in an attempt to accurately portray their experiences, but surely Auggie's experiences could have been better shown by someone who does not have the ability the wipe off their facial differences at the end of each day.\n\nAriel Henley, a writer with facial disfigurement as a result of Crouzon Syndrome, explains that she liked the idea of seeing \"someone like [herself] on the big screen\". She could identify with Auggie's struggles through numerous surgeries to correct facial differences and the childhood experience of \"trying to understand why [she] was different and why [she] didn't belong.\" The camaraderie that the craniofacial community could feel with Auggie ended once Tremblay was cast.\n\nThe film industry has a history of casting nondisabled actors as disabled characters- Dustin Hoffman in Rainman and Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump are two critically acclaimed examples. It is surprising that this pattern persists into the 21st century: a time where 'inclusion' and 'diversity' are buzzwords that have received attention across almost every facet of society.\n\nJay Ruderman, the president of the Ruderman Family Foundation which focuses on disability inclusion, makes the point that, \"We no longer find it acceptable for white actors to portray black characters. Disability as a costume needs to also become universally unacceptable\". Currently, disability acting has become a place for nondisabled actors to show the scope of their ability rather than a place to focus on the experiences of those in the disabled community.\n\nWhen a nondisabled actor plays a disabled character, the disabled experience is almost always misrepresented. This misrepresentation can cause the viewer to form stereotypes about people with disabilities and prevents nondisabled viewers from gaining an understanding of the disabled experience.\n\nNot using actors with disabilities, especially in a movie like Wonder that is aimed at children, sends the message that people with disabilities are unable to represent themselves. This message can be especially harmful to children with disabilities who, like their nondisabled peers, are still trying to figure out where they fit in the world. A lack of role models can hurt their sense of self-worth. In most cases, the only thing preventing a disabled actor from playing a disabled character is the casting director's preferences and biases.\n\nDisabled actors must be cast in order to show both nondisabled people and children with disabilities that disability does not equal incapability. Being part of the disability community should not come with shame but with pride.",

            "content": "Perks of Being a Wallflower director, Stephen Chbosky gives us his visualisation of the titular New York Times bestseller which was written by R.J. Palacio and published back in 2012 about a young boy named August \u201cAuggie\u201d who suffers with Treacher Collins syndrome. A genetic disorder that causes deformities of the face. Palacio wrote the book after an encounter involving her own young son and a girl who had several facial deformities and was all influenced by Natalie Merchant\u2019s song \u201cWonder\u201d to which she named the book after. Whilst the film does discuss the disease, it does try to ignore it and focuses on the emotions of the people directly involved and not just concentrating on Auggie. We follow Auggie as he joins elementary school after being homeschooled by his mother and we see him contend with being accepted as he tried to understand his place in the world. There\u2019s the inevitable difficulties but the film is full of heart and Auggie does become quite the inspiration. Auggie is superbly played by the young and talented Jacob Tremblay. The same boy from Room and this year\u2019s Book of Henry. It\u2019s great to see him act again, especially in a leading role this time. It must have been trying for him to go through a 90minute session of makeup application before filming. Though Tremblay isn\u2019t the only young star here. Noah Jupe is a worthy mention as he appeared to be getting an equal amount of attention as his co-star, already appearing in this month\u2019s Suburbicon and in next year\u2019s A Quiet Place. The film is rather vibrant throughout which only enforces my idea that which story, not necessarily the film, is targeted for the younger audiences. I\u2019ve not read the book myself but from the change of narrative throughout it makes me assume the book is intended for children as oppose to adult reading. Some older viewers might draw parallels with 1985\u2019s Mask, especially seeing the premise is very similar. However the outcome and lessons are very different. Arjen Tuiten has been nominated for an Oscar for his makeup to create a disfigured Auggie. It\u2019s believable though part of me feels it\u2019s done lightly and Tuiten has commented, hoping he had done the book justice. Zarvos does a joyful and uplifting score to accompany the film, again softening the blows of the reality of the situations. I feel this is done purely to be more appealing, or easier to watch. The story is very well balanced and done so cleverly so, by not telling the story from just from Auggie\u2019s point of view. It explores each of the main characters perspective and seeing how Auggie\u2019s condition and struggles has a direct effect on their own lives. This especially relates to Jupe, his best friend and Auggie\u2019s Sister Via, who is played brilliantly by Izabela Vidovic. This isn\u2019t to take anything alway from the supporting adult stars of Wilson and Roberts, but the focus is very much on the youngsters and tries to teach some good lessons about friendship, understanding, tolerance and acceptance. Overall the film carries a strong and heartfelt message which should be inspirational to many. Running Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 7 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for Tremblay and Jupe\u2019s performances. 72% 7/10 www.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

The main character, August, a homeschooled child with a facial deformity, is neither a martyr nor a saint, but an authentic 5th grader with everything from temper tantrums and self deprecating humor to a video game addiction.  However, as moving as August's story is, the lives of  \"the planets\" that orbit him are what elevate 'Wonder\" from merely a good tale to one of my favorite stories about modern American childhood. \n\nIn her rare moments of unburdened happiness, such as in one heart wrenching scene with her grandmother, August's older sister, Via, shows the collateral costs of a parents' undivided attention for their sickly child.  Via's incredibly nuanced balance of  guilt, resentment, and love often upstages her brother as \"Wonder'\"s most interesting character.\n\nJack Will's friendship and betrayal of August are painful, yet understandable, and their eventual reconciliation is a technologically authentic version of how this would actually happen in this age group.   Extroverted blonde thespian, Charlotte, who initially appears to be one of the main characters when she gives August the tour of the school, ultimately doesn't come to August's aide.  Only biracial Summer, by wanting \"some nice friends for a change,\" is brave enough to leave the girl's table and befriend August in his lowest point of isolation, as she nonchalantly upends the politics of middle school lunchroom seating.   Even shallow and arrogant social climber, Miranda, Via's ex-best friend, exposes her loneliness with one emotional phone call to August.\nAugust's mother, the Prettiest Woman in the room, and his father, funnier than being in Shanghai at Noon, enhance August's humanity and make him more realistic.  The only distraction may be Via and Justin's romance.  For unlike the other characters, Justin's storyline is only tangentially related to August's, and as such, feels extraneous.  However, otherwise, the plot moves briskly, and it is surprisingly satisfying how a single night's events reshuffle August, Jack Will, and Julian's social hierarchy.  With each twist, \"Wonder\" proves it is not a predictable, formulaic saccharine melodramatic sob story, but a drama that challenges the assumptions about all its characters, not just the one with Treacher Collins syndrome.   Even the final scene is made less corny by its homage to \"Episode 4, A New Hope,\"  -- because as everyone knows, Wookies make everything better.",

            "content": "In the movie, Wonder, Auggie Pullman (short for August) is 10 years old and has a facial deformity. He's had 27 surgerys since he was born. His mom thought it was time for him to try public school since he had been homeschooled all of his life. At his school, the kids bullied him and send him horrid notes because of the way he looked.  However, having a marred face it didn't stop him from being brave, intelligent, inspirational, funny, and friendly. Although some people may say that Auggie's appearance provokes a feeling of distrust, this movie shows that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover through Summer's, Jack's, and his Mother's support. \nAuggie meets Jack Will before school begins, to show him around the school. Jack only sat and talked with Auggie, just to be nice. He then figures that Auggie is the greatest friend that he could ever have. August thought the same, until he overheard Jack say that would rather kill himself if he looked like Auggie. He felt betrayal and thought the whole friendship was all a fake. Jack never knew Auggie was in the room, because it was Halloween and Auggie was wearing a mask. Auggie avoided Jack ever since then, he was confused and wondered why Auggie would go the other direction when he saw him. While Jack was muddled, he stated, \"Like, if all the guys in the fifth grade were lined up against a wall and I got to choose anyone I wanted to hang out with, I would choose August.\" Jack was missing Auggie so much and he eagerly wanted to hang out with him, they had the greatest times together. Jack shouldn't have judged Auggie by the way he looked in the beginning, you should always get to know a person before any judgements.\n\tWhile Auggie removed Jack from his life, Summer Dawson started to sit by Auggie at lunch. Summer has noticed Auggie since the first day of school and has found potential in him. Auggie and Summer became best friends ever since. She did asked Auggie the conflict between him and Jack, and she promised she wouldn't tell. However, Jack came across Summer in the hallways, and plead to know what he did wrong, she denied, he kept hauling, and she finally gave him a hint, which all she said was \"ghostface\". Jack finally analyzed of what she had said, because he realized that Auggie was the one in that costume. He apologized to Auggie and he forgave him. Furthermore, Summer is someone where Auggie can tell anything to. She is outgoing, selfless, brave, loyal, and a super cool girl to be around. In addition, Summer has never analyzed Auggie, she saw who he was on the inside, instead on the out.\n Lastly, Isabel Pullman (Auggies' Mother) is a huge role in August's Life. She discontinued of being a children's-book illustrations for Auggie, she was too busy homeschooling him and he is worth everything to her. She still does portraits and they are all about Auggie. I thought the most powerful wording was when she told Auggie that, \"Because I am your mom, it counts the most because I know you the most. Anyone who cares to know you will see that.\" Before the quotations, Isabel told Auggie that he wasn't ugly and he told her, she is just saying that because she is his mom. I say the exact wording with my mother because every mom tells their child that they're beautiful and I deny it. In addition, Isabel is a great supportive and will be by Auggie's side through anything. She finds nothing wrong with her sons face, she finds potential and Auggie is just an original kid with many attributes.\nThere are humans that tease others to make themselves better. They like to bully others to find good attributes about themselves. By doing so, it raises their self esteems because it releases the anger and negative that they have. You should always feel remarkable about yourself, however, this is not the way you do it. Instead of harassing someone, remember to think how you would want to be treated. Before you say, think how you would feel if somebody called you that.\t\nJack, Summer, and his Mom, have seriously helped August through school, without them, it would've been more of a challenge. Auggie learned what a friendship really felt like by Jack's and Summer's help. Auggie was alone for a straight 10 years of his life, he kept hiding and no one would welcome him, accept for his family. Auggie stayed courageous and tried to ignore all of the vulgar comments. At the end of the movie, he became someone who inspired others and Auggie Pullman never felt so sensational.",

            "content": "The film Wonder provides many lessons and thought provoking themes. The storyline is focused around a young boy with Treacher Collins Syndrome and how he is treated by others. The film brings upon feelings of anger and sadness at times when character 'Auggie' is not treated fairly, but he is a boy full of strength and spreads positivity among those around him, altering the way the community sees and treats this boy as well as all others. Using appeals of ethos, pathos and logos- the creators and actors portray the idea of treating others with kindness and respect. Continuing this review themes will be addressed from the film, the actions of character 'Auggie' in his efforts to create a better life for himself and those around him, and the effects Auggie has on those around him. \n    Wonder has an extremely emotional storyline and allows the audience to feel for this disabled boy and those around him. The film begins with a young boy playing in a astronaut helmet- we are unable to see the face of character, Auggie, creating such surprise and heartache when the helmet is removed. Critic, Liz Beardsworth, states \"Suddenly the helmet - which, painfully self-conscious, he insists on wearing - makes all too much sense.\". As the helmet is removed from Auggies head, his malformed face is exposed- and the reasoning for him wearing this helmet is understood by the audience. Thoughts are provoked by wondering what had happened to this young boy, as well as a sense of respect for Auggie and his strength throughout his difficult experiences. \n    Auggie lives with the stares, laughs, and jokes each day- this doesn't mean each look, laugh, and unkind word doesn't hurt any less each time. Auggie beings his first day of school after a childhood of homeschooling, he is nervous but ready. What should he expect from public school? Will the other kids laugh and stare? As he wanders helmet-free into his school on his first day, his mom murmurs, \"Dear god, please make them be nice to him\". Critic Bilge Ebiri describes the emotions felt by the audience well, \"It's impossible not to feel exposed right along with him: The crowd of kids parts like the Red Sea; faces turn; conversations stop; the snickering begins, muted.\". We do in fact feel exposed with Auggie when he is being laughed at as he walks into school with his head down, it is a painful feeling. \nThe stresses of Auggie's condition have effects on many people- in his family and his community. The Pullman family attempts to live a normal life, but the stresses of Auggie make this 'normal living' difficult. Mother, Isabel Pullman, devotes her entire life to her son's care and happiness. Father, Nate Pullman, is known as a 'fun dad' whom is always positive and encouraging of his children- he tries to make everything seem as if it will be okay, which some find annoying. Olivia Pullman, the sister, feels neglected and lonely in a family centered around Auggie, until later in the film when she is accompanied by a new boyfriend.  Auggie makes friends eventually- throughout the process there were many road blocks. Jack Will became his best friend until he betrayed Auggie, after many apologies they regained their friendship. \n \"The film expands even further with its perspectives: We also hear from Miranda, as well as from Jack Will. This builds out empathy, allowing us to understand that all these people - even the supposedly cruel ones - have their reasons.\" states critic Bilge Ebiri. The reasoning behind others actions help us understand them better and feel for them. \n    While the film has a great storyline, some would argue it is over-played or over-powering. Critic Liz Beardsworth stands at a neutral point in her movie review saying \"The movie has many great perspectives and messages, although it can feel pushed and at times too much\". Throughout the film we encounter emotional experiences of Auggie Pullman, which all have similar stories- a bully making Auggie feel self-conscious or less than and the effect it has on him. \"Wonder is that rare thing, a family picture that moves and amuses while never overtly pandering.\" states Critic, Glenn Kenny. Wonder is a film that could change many lives, helping others feel accepted and not alone, and helping others realize the effects of their unkind and hurtful actions toward those around them. \n\nAnnotated Bibliography: Wonder\nWonder. Dir. Stephen Chbosky. Perf. Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, Jacob Tremblay, Lionsgate, 2017. Film.\nWonder is a film following a young boy, Auggie, with treacher collins syndrome as fights to fit in with everyone one else. This movie describes many themes and gives insight on lessons of acceptance, courage, kindness and strength. The Pullman family attempts to live a normal life, but the stresses of Auggie's condition makes this difficult. Mother, Isabel, dedicates her entire life to the care and nurturing of her son. Sister, Olivia, has feelings of neglect and loneliness throughout the beginning of the movie until she is accompanied by a new boyfriend. Father, Nate, is the 'fun dad' whom is always positive and encouraging of his children. To best portray the messages of the film Chbosky used examples of ethos, pathos and logos.

Web. 1 Feb. 2018.\nCritic, Kenny Glenn,  describes this movie as 'worthwhile and sentimental'. \"Wonder is that rare thing, a family picture that moves and amuses while never overtly pandering.\" said Glenn Kenny. Kenny shares his likes toward character, Auggie, and summarizes his story in Wonder. The review shares evidence points from the film, Wonder, using ethos, pathos, and logos appeals. This is a secondary source. \nEbiri, Bilge. \"You Should Probably Bring Some Tissues to \"Wonder\".\" The Village Voice, https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/11/17/you-should-probably-bring-some-tissues-to-wonder/ \n    Critic, Bilge Ebiri, has a neutral stance toward the movie Wonder. The critic begins with telling his audience \"You should probably bring some tissues to movie, Wonder.\" \"The film expands even further with its perspectives: We also hear from Miranda, as well as from Jack Will. This builds out empathy, allowing us to understand that all these people - even the supposedly cruel ones - have their reasons. We learn of the high-stakes world of middle school bullies and victims, of cool kids and losers.\" says Ebiri. The appeals of ethos, pathos, and logos make his review credible and interesting, pulling his audience into his thoughts. Ebiri makes a statement in his review saying \"As he wanders helmet-free into his school on his first day, with his mom murmuring, \"Dear god, please make them be nice to him\", it's impossible not to feel exposed right along with him: The crowd of kids parts like the Red Sea; faces turn; conversations stop; the snickering begins, muted.\". This statement uses a strong emotional appeal that resonates with readers and watchers of this movie- many who have read or watched story Wonder can relate to the statement \"it's impossible not to feel exposed right along with him.\". This is a secondary source. \nBeardsworth, Liz. \"Wonder.\" Empire, Empire, 1 Dec. 2017, www.empireonline.com/movies/wonder-2/review/. \n    Critic, Liz Beardsworth, stands at a neutral point in her review of Wonder. \"The themes of compassion, acceptance and kindness ring loud and clear. It's a film with a big heart.\" Liz describes how the movie has many great perspectives and messages, although it can feel pushed and at times too much. This review summarizes the film Wonder well, as well as the actors and their part in portraying the story. Beardsworth talks of actor Julia Roberts, and her incredible performance in playing the part of Isabel Pullman after many 'low-key years' in her career. Using a pathos appeal, the critic states \"Suddenly the helmet - which, painfully self-conscious, he insists on wearing - makes all too much sense.\". In many other instances the review contains evidence of ethos, pathos, and logos appeals. This is a secondary source.",

            "content": "Oh my goodness.  So this is about a young boy, Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) who is about to enter the 5th grade.  He has been home schooled all of his life, so this is a huge adjustment to be sure, but there is a small hitch: he has a facial deformity.  Will he be able to find acceptance in the classroom at an age where children have the tendency to be their most brutal?  Now I was actually upset that I missed this in theaters.  Unlike The Breadwinner where it never came to a theater near me, Wonder had a long and extended theatrical run, I just never found the time in my schedule to go out and watch it.  I had heard how emotional this was in advance, and yeah, I have no problem telling you that this melted my heart and made me cry.  This stars the kid from Room, and he has arguably the most talent I have ever seen in somebody so young, even more than Haley Joel Osment at his age.  He gives an incredible performance, and the fact that he does so with such extensive make-up just makes it all the more impressive.  Even though you probably don't have the same unique problem that Auggie has, Wonder is extremely easy to relate to, and it is a story that is accessible at every turn.  Bullying is a huge issue in school that doesn't get brought up nearly as often as it should, and it tends to be at its worst in the middle school years.  It is bad enough if you have something that makes you stand out, like a mole or glasses, but to have a feature this drastic is nothing short than an emotional death sentence at this age.  It just breaks your heart to see this sweet child struggle, and you want to see him rise up and overcome as much as he does.  Wonder manages to pull off the difficult feat of accomplishing all of the above without ever becoming sappy.  I know that in lesser hands, this would probably be what we would be looking at, and even the supporting actors like Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson really do bring good performances to the table.  I know that this movie will make parents and children have more conversations about bullying, and I hope this does raise awareness across the nation.  There is nothing wrong with being different, and I highly recommend this movie.",

There are sometimes where the focus comes off of Auggie and focuses on other people in Auggie's life, his sister, his best friend, and his sister's best friend, and it shows that he's not the only one having a hard life, which was great, because it fleshes out the character and explains why they're doing this, why they're at this school, and why they behave the way they do. My only issue was I wanted to see more characters fleshed out, like the kid bullying him, his sister's boyfriend, and some of his other friends.

You can still show this to kids: it's a good lesson. But for the rest of us, the ones falling in love with \"The Elephant man\", is just a commercial and flat work.

            "content": "Wonder is surprisingly a really good film. It delivers with a powerful performance from Jacob Tremblay and the rest of the cast, it had a well written story, and it delivers emotionally. Sure, this film can be a tearjerker and make you smile at the same time. It has its feel good moment. It is also co-written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, the same guy that did the film The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Which was also really good, if you seen it and enjoyed it. You will most like enjoy this as well. Auggie (Jacob Tremblay) was born with a Treacher Collins syndrome and had many plastic surgery done to repair his facial structure. He was always home schooled by his mother (Julia Roberts) and played with his dad (Owen Wilson) and talked about Star Wars which he always reference to those movies. His older sister (Izabela Vidovic) was always there for him until she was feeling unnoticed by her parents. Auggie is being sent to a school which he tries to prepare himself for interacting with other kids. Which some kids will be respectable while others are not. What I like about the film is the direction and it's an emotional story. It is about a child that wants to fit in with the rest of the kids. He would always wear a space helmet when he is at the park or in public. Afraid of being humiliated by the people or nervous to see how they would react. Sure, the world is not always nice. You get those sympathizing people but than there are also those rude judgmental kids that still cause the issue of bullying as of today. But this film works really well when it shows the theme of feeling neglected. Like Auggie's sister (Izabela Vidovic). She is the forgotten child with the parents. Nobody ever paid attention to her when she is trying to seek it. Her best friend is ignoring her and her first day of high school was being alone until she meets a friendly boy that tells her to join the theatre arts class. Then, the narration does go over her best friends perspective on why she was neglecting her. Every narration of these characters works well, it helps build emotional connection with these characters. Even Auggie's friend perspective was shown that his mother was hoping he would do a good deed for a scholarship. Jacob Tremblay did great with the character from the emotional performance as Auggie and the make up work was good. Julia Roberts was great and Owen Wilson has the supporting father and husband. Izabela Vidovic was great and seeing this as her first performance in a movie. Noah Jupe as Jack and Auggies best friend. The music score Marcelo Zarvos and Bea Miller was great. The script was well written and well developed with all the characters. What I did not like about the movie is it can be predictable. We may have seen these movies before. A kid gets bullied for how they look, the emotional pressure of dealing with these problems, and soon he is making more friends. But this film can be forgiven since it is about how he handles these challenges of going to school and how the people around him are handling there every day of being neglected too. Overall, Wonder is a really good film. The acting is superb. The story and direction is an emotional roller coaster and a feel good movie. The script is well written in handling these characters. And it does have its predictableness. I definitely recommend you seeing this film. I rate the film 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Sappy films aren't everyone's cup of tea, but when a film embraces its sappiness and turns it into something emotionally resonant, then I truly believe that they can be some of the best films out there. While Wonder may have looked a little overdone throughout its marketing campaign, making it out to be a film about a kid being bullied for looking different from everyone else, that's honestly just scratching the surface of what the message of this film really is. There is always a feel-good movie that I attach myself to every year, and I believe Wonder is probably the film from 2017 that did it for me. No, it's not going to win awards for originality, but quite honestly, if there was an award for moving your audience to tears, then Wonder would earn top honors. This movie deserves to be seen by everyone of all ages and here's why.\n\nFollowing Auggie Pullman, a young fifth grader who was born under unlikely circumstances, leaving him to deal with looking different than everyone else around him, this is a story about the courage to ignore the bad and embrace the good. I was expecting this film to be strictly about the character of Auggie, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film divides itself into sections that explore each of the characters that surround him and their reasoning for either being nice or mean to our protagonist. I found the construction of this film to be one of the most commendable aspects because the end result only benefited from this.\n\nEver since I first watched him perform in Room, Jacob Tremblay continues to prove that he's either ten years older than he looks, or that he's just a gifted actor that won't let a single movie prevent him from being stellar. This young actor has an incredibly bright future ahead of him. Whether it was narration that dived into his psyche or simply his natural interaction with his friends and family, I truly saw this character as a real person, instead of a generic young actor in a movie. Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts give solid performances as well, along with Noah Jupe and Izabela Vidovic being very solid in their supporting roles. Where this film may turn some viewers off (which I think will be a very slim few) is in its eye-rolling emotional core.\n\nLook, you can't go into a film like Wonder and expect something with raw human emotion like a film that has family in and out of prison because this is for families. If you're looking for the most realistic film in terms of realism, then I would suggest looking elsewhere, but if you're up for a great family movie that will make you cry every few minutes and make you want to hug the closest person around you, then Wonder is just about as perfect as they come. This is easily the feel-good movie of 2017 that deserved every dollar it received at the box office.\n\nIn the end, Wonder explores a story that feels familiar, but not exactly ever told in this way before. We've seen thousands of stories revolving around bullying and looking different, but we see it from multiple perspectives here and watching all of these characters transform around the expense of the character of Auggie was such a delight. For people who want to sit down and watch a movie that will make them feel amazing, I can't recommend watching Wonder enough. Everything about this film is well-done. From its writing that does a good enough job in exploring multiple characters to the direction that focuses on emotion first, to musical cues that will have you in tears, to the very notion that our world can be a better place if people were kinder, Wonder has it all. Aside from feeling sappy at times, I absolutely loved this movie from start to finish.",

The chaptering system gives us a glimpse of the same character from multiple perspectives, and gives individuals how would otherwise be mostly stuck on the side-lines a chance to participate fully in the narrative. School bullies have always been one of my least favourite film and TV clich\u00e9s, and while it was probably necessary to include them here to drive home the central message, they could definitely have been more subtle and nuanced. At least they are given some level of redemption at one stage or another. It's a simple tale of acceptance, told simply and without many bells and whistles.

Directed by Stephen Chbosky, Wonder explores the story of a young boy with a birth defect as he navigates the life of a 5th grade boy. The film, however, is so much more than this one overarching story. Using clever film tactics, the film shares the story from several different points of view. With each of the character's view, you gain more perspective on the story and can find at least one character and story that you can relate to. \n\nChbosky plays to everyone's emotions as you take yourself back to your own time in grade school desiring to be accepted. Based on the book by the same name, this film has several layers to it. From acceptance, being \"seen\", bullying, to making tough decisions, this film explores several life lessons that we all need to hear right now. Everyone, young and old, can find one layer that tugs at your heart and makes you empathize with the characters and what they are going through. It was masterful writing and the \"perspective\" tactic was pleasing to watch. \n\nWhen you think about the character development and the acting, you can go ahead and just give Jacob Tremblay (Auggie) an Oscar for his role. He is likable, smart, and plays the heck out of this character. Some may not like seeing Owen Wilson (Nate) in another \"serious\" role, but Wilson plays it very well. I appreciate Wilson stepping out for what he is known for and he is a very believable loving father alongside on-screen wife, Julia Roberts (Isabel). The character development in this film was well thought out and helps push the story along. \n\nOverall you will leave this film filled with a lot of emotions. It makes you recall your own upbringing and your desire for acceptance from so many in your own life. At the same time, it requires you to also ask the question of whether you are accepting others while also desiring the same. Wonder is worth your time and money and was a great life-lesson picture. Go see it!",

We are not just seeing life solely from the perspective of a bullied character with a birth defect. We see the sister. We see the guy who becomes his friend.  An Owen Wilson who is dialed back a notch comedically in order to be, just a dad, turns out to be a very good thing. There is a lot of great dialogue.

Stephen Chbosky is, quite thankfully, a terrific director and he employs these elements in the way a good director does. https://geeks.media/movie-review-wonder?_ga=2.158310650.1126457623.1513947710-953607229.1513947710",

            "content": "My score for; Wonder is an 8 out of 10. Wonder is a touching warm family film that shows no matter how we look on the outside it is the actions that ultimately determines who you really are. Wonder takes on the journey of a boy born with deformities as his parents have decided at start of his fifth grade year it is time for him to enter the real world. Jacob Tremblay plays August \u201cAuggie\u201d our main character who has been protected with home schooling to this point in his life. The performance Jacob gives is outstanding. You can feel the pain he experiences from being judged and picked on. At the same time the heart of his character will make you wish all children were like him. Julia Roberts gives her best performance in a number of years as the mother. She is overprotective, but at the same time one who has heart that leads the family, and all consider their mother type. Owen Wilson is at is Best in these type roles where he is understated. He is very believable as loving, funny caring father type. The film does a wonderful job of not presenting the movie just through Auggie\u2019s or his mother\u2019s eyes, but through several of the families members and friends. This gives the movie an excellent opportunity to show how Auggie\u2019s condition effects not just him, but everyone who in his life. The film gives you the feels you would expect from a movie of this type, but tows the line well enough never to go for the cheap feels. The movie I feel is held back by not going far enough into how cruel the kids would have been in a situation like this. The movie ultimately makes everyone with at least bit of redemption. Which I do not feel is realistic to situations of kids being cruel, and the adults who influence them. Overall Wonder is a wonderful family story. It delivers some terrific performances. Has a very nice message, but plays it safer than it should have. ",

With a script that tells the story of Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay), a boy of 10 years a facial deformation, and after going through 27 surgeries, the same still tries to integrate to a normal life of a child, going through prejudices, difficulties and obstacles, the film becomes very interesting from the point of use of several points of view to tell the story of Auggie, even if it slightly lessens the impact of Auggie's drama, but with these diversity of views , other points are discussed, such as the formation of friendship versus the loss of friendship, and as friends may be escape valves, such as family participation, are beautiful points and very interesting, do not come to have extreme depth, but are well crafted, pity that in some moments the film disbands total to a story any good vibes with an ending that passes a generic message of union and love. the film has an \"Okay\" direction, it works well at the camera angles, it has a bluish photograph, but in technical terms, we do not have anything that jumps to the eyes, the pace can sometimes fail, but the film trail compensates with its quality . The first thing everyone wanted to check out was the performance of Jacob Tremblay, the young promise that charmed everyone in \"Jack's Room\" had everything to steal completely the scene here, which does not happen, but the young actor does a very good performance , changing his way of walking and talking, but we can not feel the drama of the character just for his acting, we also have the great Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson who make a couple of chemistry and always entertains and enchants the viewers, even being their fantastic performances, are two good actors that work well together, and the biggest highlight in terms of acting for me is for Izabela Vidovic, because even the character apparently having more \"silly\" drama, is the drama that we feel the most, much because of his performance that is great. Finally, \"Extraordinario\" is more for an ordinary film, not in the complete pejorative sense, but in the sense that, we have seen this many times before, and even though it is nice to see, it is the kind of movie that oscar likes give indication to the best film, even if it is not a work of art.",

Its message of kindness and acceptance resonates beautifully simply through showing the world through the eyes of diverse characters.\n\nNow, did the movie perfectly encapsulate the book's wonder? Not quite. They made a handful of changes to characterization that were slight enough to maintain the story's integrity but noticeable enough to the reader to be bizarre. Backgrounds were at times changed, motivations and personalities tweaked, and the only reason I can see for them altering the text in such a way is to make a story less complicated to tell in two hours. Who has time to fully flesh out the stories of a baker's dozen middle and high school students in a feature film? I get it, at least somewhat, although I do have to say that dropping Justin's facial tics and neglectful parents made me sad as an uberfan. Those elements have substance and purpose. \n\nEven with these minor changes, Wonder does a pretty solid conveying the ideas of the book with poise and grace. In a sold out theater, whimpering could be heard as Auggie Pullman endures and strikes back. For those who haven't read the book, I would recommend you do pick it up, as it has an appeal all its own.",

It also teaches and inspires future children to follow their dreams and passion and know that their dreams are realized; inspires us to realize the dreams and passions and futures.

Based on a YA bestseller, on the surface this is about Auggie, a 10 year old boy with facial deformities attending preparatory school for the first time after years of home-schooling. As expected, he experiences hardships and friendships, tears and laughter; and if you have seen the trailer, you'd think that's all there is to it. Thankfully, the film is clever enough to widen its scope to include points of view from his neglected sister and his schoolmates and it becomes not just about one individual but a bunch of young people trying to fit in, in various ways and forms. Stephen Chboksy's film is full of humour, aspirations and sentiments that are well judged and do not come across as lazy writing. Jacob Tremblay proves he is no one hit wonder after Room and his Auggie is funny and touching. He leads a cast of likeable and unprecocious young actors who are all a joy to watch, while Julia Roberts supports with her million wattage star presence, but always allowing her younger co-stars to shine around her. Even Owen Wilson is decent and that's saying something. Perhaps part of the story may feel lighter than feather or too on the nose and admittedly this is a world where everything, from the school to the Brownstone they live in, is idealized but as far from reality as this may be to many viewers, it is also a relatable and tender film that is heartfelt without being saccharine and maudlin - and that's rather wonderful, isn't it?",

That said, even if I would label Wonder as a very good movie, not everything is perfect. I was happy the movie ended, I had enough. I don't feel sorry I watched it but I will not watch the movie again, even in 10 years, on TV. That has to do with the fact, that the movie chose the easy path. Of course, a kid with such physical deformities will be rejected at first and accepted because kids are pure. I feel like Wonder 2, Auggie as a teenager, struggling with his hormones at the time appearance matters the most, would be more interesting and more powerful. It doesn't take away the fact that Wonder is a wonderful movie, that should be shown is school and used to debate about prejudice and acceptation of difference.

            "content": "Wonder is directed and co-written by Stephen Chbosky, and it stars Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, and Jacob Tremblay in a drama film about a kid that is going to public school for the first time after being homeschooled for years, and the reason behind that is that August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) is born with Treacher Collins Syndrome, and so the parents let him into middle school where he can hopefully adapt there. When I saw that Stephen Chbosky is making another film, I was interested in it as The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my favorite films, and while this wasn't one of the most anticipated films of the year as there were others that I was looking forward to, I wanted to see this nonetheless. I went to go see this with my mom and her boyfriend, and we unanimously agreed that we absolutely loved this movie. Jacob Tremblay is very likable in this, and doesn't come off as annoying, but has to put in some emotional moments that are very well done, which is a rarity of a kid that age to succeed in that, especially with the make-up which looks impressive and convincing that the character has to go through. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson are great in it that doesn't act in any way embarrassing for the main kid, and they show how much they care about their son given the condition that he's in that'll lead to some problems in school. The writing by Jack Thorne, Steve Conrad, and Stephen Chbosky is well-written that doesn't go to the easy route of just being melodramatic or emotionally manipulative as it builds up the characters that you end up really like and understand what the main kid and some other characters have to go through that you really do feel for them, especially since my mom and her boyfriend were tearing up a lot during this film and I only got teary-eyed in 2 scenes, so the movie is doing something right for the audience. The movie goes in perspectives from the son, the sister, or the friend, and it's interesting to watch from their stories to understand the situation from their point of view. So while this is not as good as The Perks of Being a Wallflower due to personal reasons and the fact that this is one of my favorite films, Wonder is still a fantastic movie that's very heartfelt and funny enough that won't make you depressed while watching this.",

All of the characters are completely lovable to the point of being too perfect.  Our heart strings are played in every possible way.

Jacob Tremblay (remember that name) sets off an amazing perfomance as the young facial-deformed August (Auggie). His performance, together with the rest of the cast (who also do not disappoint a second) is inspiring and moving. \"Wonder\" hits you with laughter, joy, sadness and anger at the exact right spot throughout the movie, and it does so while you are speechless of how realistic it is.",

This is definitely a film that kids today should see, with the way bullying and social media are so prevalent. The way this film portrays bullying isn't the only point. The storytelling -  we see how the bullying of the main character affects him, his sister, parents, friends, teachers. That's why it stands out. If you're a parent, Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson give performances that you can latch onto. Nothing so dramatic that they become cartoonish, or the film becoming too preachy, it doesn't happen. You will just connect to these characters, especially Jacob Tremblay as Auggie. Jacob Tremblay may be looking at more nominations for this performance, absolutely amazing! Auggie's sister Via, played by Izabela Vidovic - her storyline is just as strong, if not stronger.\n\nIt says something that I had trouble with distractions when seeing this, because the entire auditorium was full of people crying and blowing their noses. Heartwarming, beautiful, it took me longer to get out and catch this one than I would have liked but I'm so glad I was finally able to. If you have the time, take your kids to see this one.

All that changes, however when Auggie enrolls into a mainstream school for the first time in his life. As Auggie struggles to cope with new challenges such as making friends and fitting in throughout the year, his family also must overcome their own obstacles throughout the whole year...\n\nFollowing the critical success of one of the most honest depictions of teenage life in the form of The Perks of being a Wallflower, it's only natural that Stephen Chbosky would be the best choice, for this adaptation of the 2012 novel about living with Treacher Collins syndrome ,Wonder. Like that previous film, the strong acting and the honest, yet heartwarming screenplay is what makes this film stand out from the typical Oscar-buzz fare that revolves around similar topics.\n\nAside from a slightly miscast Owen Wilson, the acting, espically from the child actors is extremely well done. Fresh off of his success with Room, Jacob Tremblay does wonders with the sympathetic and lovable Auggie, while also not being afraid to bring a sarcastic, cheeky side to his personality. The screenwriters Jack Thorne, Steve Conrad and Stephen Chbosky are extremely good at writing arcs for young people which is shown even in characters such as Auggie's friends, but especially with Auggie's sister, who in the wrong hands, her subplot involving her troubles with friends and having a crush on a guy in her drama class, could have come across as incredibly boring, but amazingly, these writers know how to make this character incredibly sympathetic and likable as well.\n\nOverall, Wonder is a marvellous family film that gives the audience a genuinely sincere experience, while also reminding them, that anyone can be anything, regardless of appearances.",

            "content": "I know I've said this on several occasions, but I'm never a fan of films that seem to be made specifically to make the audience cry. I bring that up because it could appear to some people that Wonder does that very thing, as the film revolves around a child born with Treacher Collins Syndrome and the various troubles that his family goes through with a world that doesn't understand the genetic disorder. Naturally a film that centers upon a child constantly being made fun of is difficult to handle emotionally. However, Wonder approaches this subject matter with a certain amount of genuineness that is undeniably endearing. So the problem I have with the films mentioned above, does not apply here at all.\n\nI'm not one of those people who go out of their way to deny when films bring them to tears and so I'm going to flat out say right now that I don't believe any film has impacted me this much and at a consistent rate than Wonder did. I can't tell you how many times I found myself clearing my eyes from the rain shower that was about to invade my sight. And I say this with so much respect and admiration to what this film was able to accomplish. Credit should most definitely be given to Stephen Chbosky's directing, adapting, and also R.J. Palacio's book the film is based on. But I was most impressed with the casting and performances of the film.\n\nAfter 'Room', we all knew he was in for great things, and Wonder is yet another example of the prodigy that is Jacob Tremblay's the actor (Auggie). Being the heart and soul of the movie, Tremblay gives a wonderfully poignant performance, and equally balances his innocence at 10 years old but also the inner strength he displays in not giving in to the bullies he faces. I also found the rest of the young actors they cast as his classmates to be impeccably realized. A lot of times when you have a bully(s) storyline it's difficult to portray their antics honestly. It usually feels like they are writing the bully's dialogue to service the arc of the main protagonist. In Wonder, every character of importance has depth and it's understood why the particular person would say or do whatever they were doing in those moments. Heck, there were moments where I felt bad for the bullies in Auggie Pullman's life.\n\nThis also goes for Auggie's parents and sister as well played by Julia Roberts, Owen Wilson, and Izabela Vidovic respectively. It was difficult to adjust at first, because I was so attached to Auggie's story, but I really appreciated this film taking the time to round out his family and friends. The film even chooses to have particular sequences in the other character's perspectives, which brings up an interesting topic the film covers. That is, the idea of equating your problems with those of someone in a different position than you. Auggie, having a facial deformity, certainly goes through a great deal of pain as the grade and most of society doesn't view him as a normal kid. However, the film also provides other characters with their own issues like Via (his sister) not receiving any attention from her parents, Miranda's (Via's friend) parents being divorced, and Jack Will (Auggie's best friend) having to forcibly hang out with him at first. By no means are some of those issues at the same level as Auggie's, but I appreciate this story taking the time to detail the supporting characters and not just show them as people without a backstory, which is what plenty of films do.\n\nOverall, Wonder is a film I didn't expect to love so much. My only complaints, which are very minuscule to the ultimate plot, are one particular small plot decision (that I know the book also did) late in the third act which I felt was entirely unnecessary and a little bit manipulative. Aside from that, the film is perhaps 7-10 minutes too long, but there's so many things to hang your hat on that those complaints didn't matter in the long run. It's as endearing as it is earnest in its storytelling, and we need more movies like that these days.\n\n9.4/10",

Zing.\n\nAnd there were some of those times that felt \"cheap\" (like when the cat jumps out behind you in a horror movie just to scare you).   \n\nBut overall, the movie is very touching in its humanity.  While there are definitely some tears of sadness.  There are also tears of happiness.  And tears of people connecting with one another in deeply personal ways.\n\nWith all of that said, I went back and forth on the rating.  Typically I reserve a 4 for something I think should be Best Picture nominated.  And I don't think this falls into that category.

But in order for Auggie to do so, he has to conquer the unthinkable task of middle school. He has been homeschooled by his mom, living his life behind an astronaut helmet, and playing with his best friend Daisy, his dog. For Auggie to feel somewhat normal, his parents have decided that he needs to venture out and found that the best time would be the first year of middle school. In their minds, everyone would be new to the school, and they would all be nervous about having to adjust to a new environment. Although something as simple as middle school doesn't sound like a hard thing, his older sister Via explains it, Auggie won the lottery without getting anything great out of it. At the time when Auggie was born, his parents carried the same gene at the same time leading Auggie to a life with Treacher Collins Syndrome, and facial deformities, that lead to him being self-conscious about getting out of his comfort zone. Although he won the unfortunate lottery of his diagnoses, he hit the jackpot with his supportive parents and his sister Via.",

It is a story of many loves: between a mother and son, mother and daughter, father and son, father and daughter, brother and sister along with what it means to be different.\n\nIn this case Auggie was born facial deformities and had to go through many operations to be able to talk, see, hear, among other things. His mother stepped off her path to home school him which was a must due to all the surgeries but decided at the age of 10 Auggie was ready, had to, join the real world and started him at middle school where most of the kids would also be facing a strange world.\n\nKids can be cruel to each other, especially to those who are different, and Auggie is taunted, classmates being ugly towards him, afraid of touching him thinking he might be contagious, not being friendly to him but ostracizing him, making fun of his looks and generally bullying him. Due to his facial abnormalities he looks forward to Halloween so his face can be covered with the kids not knowing who he is and he can cat, be, one of them.\n\nBased on a best-selling young adult novel by R. J. Palacio and adapted for the screen by Stephen Chbosky, Steven Conrad and Jack Thorne \"Wonder\" it is a film for everyone who have had to deal with problems, people and just life in general. \"Wonder\" is about children and adults made for children and adults.\n\nJacob Tremblay, as Auggie, had a breakout role in \"The Room\" and follows that up with a different acting challenge meeting it head on and makes Auggie a real child with all the problems a child faces learning, knowing his deformity is just another one. His older sister Via, played superbly by Izabela Vidovic, loves her brother but knows she had to be shunted aside by her parents while Auggie was in and out of hospitals. As he starts middle school she is just starting high school after her best friend, Danielle Rose Russell, returned from a summer away a different person than the one she was. She also meets Nadji Jeter who introduces her to the school theatre group.\n\nOf the other children all come across as children you knew when you went to school. There is Noah Jupe as Jack who befriends Auggie and unknowingly turns his back on him, Bryce Gheisar as Julian the lead bully with his own group of followers who make things worse for Auggie and when Julian is faced with his bullying his parents stand up for him.\n\nWhen it comes to the adults the principal, Mandy Patinkin and his homeroom teacher Daveed Diggs treat Auggie as just another kid while Ali Liebert, a science teacher, backs Auggie's interest in science and his class project. Sonia Braga's cameo as Via's grandmother has an effective scene with her granddaughter.\n\nJacob Tremblay is the star of the movie but Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson, as parents all kids wish they had, contribute not only as loving, supporting parents but parents who deal with the problems their younger son has to face. They are both warm, strong people yet you see the concern as she sends her boy off to school and the realization that both her children may soon be leaving their home. Wilson is the fun dad, the one who can make his kids live safe and who can act as childish as they do yet let them see how much he also loves their mother.\n\nDirector Stephen Chbosky does an excellent job showing the home life, the school life and the social interactions, both negative and positive, between young people, moving smoothly bringing emotional times, looking at and answering hard questions, while showing the most important lessons both kids and adults need to learn.\n\n\"Wonder\" is a film parents can take their children to without embarrassment and both will be entertained, share recognizable moments from their own relationships with each other and others and during the 133 minutes of the film bringing the audience along for the ride and involve them emotionally.",

And I do admit I did shed some tears but it's not even about the kid. Great performances by Tremblay, Owen Wilson, Julia Roberts and Izabela Vidovic.",

            "content": "Sometimes we forget there is more to the movies than entertainment. Sometimes, it seems, we forget that there can be more to a story than information, simple insight, or distraction, but rather that a story can genuinely move you. I mean, truly move you to the point it inspires a change in mentality, a refreshed outlook, or even just a slight alteration in compassion. As sappy and excessively sweet as it may sound that is what Wonder does. It is a movie that has all the trappings of a melodramatic dramedy that plays on the sentimentalities of the audience in false ways and if you're a seasoned movie-goer of any kind it's easy to see why this would be pinpointed as such. The trailers and other marketing material have made Wonder look like something that ranks somewhere between a Hallmark made-for-TV movie and an after school special that serves to show children the repercussions of bullying, but walking out of the theater it is beyond evident that this movie is so much more than these dismissive descriptions would have you believe. Wonder never succumbs to the sappiness of it all, but more importantly is when it does reach for its peak emotional moments or dare to try to move the audience-it owns it completely. Wonder is a movie aware of what it is meant to do without being self-aware in the slightest. The word is humble. Wonder is a movie that defines being respectable without having to feel like it needs to announce its importance; it just is. Manipulative by nature, but unassuming and wholly modest in its execution writer/director Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) finds the perfect balance in understanding the specifics of what his movie is intended to accomplish while making the audience wholly aware of it without flat-out exploiting their emotions. As a dad though, this thing hit me right where it was supposed to and while I understand that what is presented on screen is to a large degree a completely manufactured world where the schools are exaggerated, family time is strictly mandated, and there seems no financial concerns whatsoever these are also all things that aren't critical to the main idea and morality that the film is trying to convey and much can be forgiven when your movie promotes a simple idea like kindness this well and moves you this effectively.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

They almost always turn out to be low-effort dreck designed to milk money from impressionable children's parents and strike terror in the hearts of ushers like me and my coworkers. Wonder is different, though. Not about the terror part; Wonder is a mess to clean up after. It's a rare kids' movie that has heart and a worthwhile message.\n\nWonder is the story of Auggie Pullman, and it is an emotional roller-coaster of a story. Jacob Tremblay (Room) is unrecognizable under his makeup as Auggie. Ta-Nehisi Coates once wrote that black Americans have to be twice as good to be accepted, but the same sentiment applies to Tremblay's Auggie. The movie does a great job of avoiding infantilizing him, instead making him an impressive character who controls his own story. You will feel inspired by his ability to weather hardship, and you'll empathy for him when life becomes too difficult.\n\nAuggie's story isn't the only one being told, though. Other characters get to narrate their own chapters, which shows how Auggie's life impacts the so-called \"normal\" people around him. However, these chapters are too brief and underdeveloped. Focusing on the supporting characters tends to feel like more of a distraction from than an addition to the story. I understand why these chapters exist, though. Wonder's target audience is the so-called \"normal\" people. If it wants them to be kinder people to those who are different from them, then it has to address them directly and provide them with role models to follow. That's why I don't mind that Wonder is drawing in massive, messy crowds. The more people who see this movie, the less terrible a place this world is for people just like Auggie Pullman.",

Perhaps some could extrapolate there is an agenda in this movie, but I think that\u2019s a stretch. This movie gave me hope in Hollywood and hope that more good stories will hit the theaters again. You can take the whole family to this movie, which is relatable to everyone. The characters and their relationships are so real. We all cried and laughed during this movie, which really grips you emotionally. It is a wonderful uplifting movie and superbly acted by Roberts and Wilson and cast. Just go see this movie!!!",

In a time when D*nald Tr*mp is president and the world feels like a dark, lonely place... this film can give hope to kids who feel different and alone.  I wasn't aware of this movie when I agreed to go see it, but I'm so glad that I did.  Is Tremblay going to be the youngest winner of the Best Actor Academy Award?  I wouldn't be mad if he swept the awards season.  Watch this film!",

            "content": "\"Wonder\": This elevator only goes down\n\n\"Wonder\" stars the standout Jason Tremblay of Room. This time, he's grown up and plays Auggie, a 5th Grader and not a five year old as he did in Room. The other standouts include Noah Jupe as Jack, his friend, Bryce Gheisar as Julian, his bully, and Izabela Vidovic as Via (Olivia), his sister. Owen Wilson snarks his way though the film with a some decent dialogue and not much else. Julia Roberts is okay and only slightly nauseating as the mother. Again, the dialogue elevated her performance until the last scenes.  \n\nIn the end, \"Wonder\" fell apart like a cheap computer that has just passed it's warranty date. \nStephen Chbosky's directing of \"Wonder,\" based on the book by R.J. Palacio, is okay, but nothing special. The writing saves a few scenes, the dialogue at least, but the ending ruined a perfectly decent film. \n\nThe music was too loud and overbearing, especially during the last unbelievable moments of a film the writers ruined by making sure we were all uplifted by the special moment. In fact, the events in the film for Auggie, a physically deformed boy from birth, pass too easily and with few complications. It would have made a great after-school special, a clich\u00e9 insult that is totally appropriate here.   \n\nThe start of the movie brought us into the drama in an interesting manner by slowly introducing us to Auggie, his issues, and his challenges going to school. Another thing the film does well is show how the drama played just not for Auggie, the child with the genetic disfigurement, but how it affects his sister, his sister's best friend Miranda and his friend Jake. \n\nMy mom said \"Wonder\" was long. It seemed long, although it was less than two hours. That's not a good sign. If I were to rate the movie from the first third, I would say pay full price. But after thinking about the ending of the film I have to rate it lower. ?\n\nRating: Rent it. \n\nThe maudlin ending ruined a well constructed opening. But don't blame Tremblay or the other child actors. Blame the writers and director who seemed to think they needed a rousing, over the top ending to sell tickets to a film-going public he seems to think are emotionally retarded.  \n\nPeace, \nTex",

As a Christian and teacher I am irritated at its excusing nearly everyone for their bad choices; yes, there is usually more to the story, but the truth is that most people want their sin at some point. To do otherwise takes a miracle of God's help in repentance, and this movie likes to present everyone as inherently good instead (the only exception being where they hypocritically blame someone else for a kid's problems). It therefore also pushes the 'you can do anything' lie, instead of the truth that apart from God, you can do nothing (John 15:5). I know this is aimed at a tween audience, but it isn't helpful to represent the world in lies. For example, while still Godless, Frozen did a much better job of presenting the depth of what it takes to overcome.",

I don't think this film truly captures the book, mainly because I don't think it captures the characters essences as well, and not because of the acting, because of the writing. If you haven't read the book though, I think this is a pretty good film to see. The acting in this film is superb 99% of the time and it did make me tear up. One thing I felt was interesting about this movie was that although I knew how the book ended, I was surprised at how early the film ended. I would say this is mostly a good thing, as it alludes to the fact that I was enjoying the movie so much, I didn't realize how much time had passed. But, I also think this is partly because the film isn't very coherent. It's told in a very choppy manner and I personally loved it, but I don't think most people would.

However I was not counting on the story of this film to be told from multiple people's perspective. That aspect to the film surprised me. I also was not expecting the film to occasionally tell one persons perspective then latter stop rewind a little to tell the story from another persons perspective then continue back to the story. I really enjoyed how this films story was told and I thought that it was a unique way to tell the story. There was one thing I was disappointed by was even though we hear the story from the kids who are going to school we never hear the parents or teachers perspective told in the same way that the kids stories are told. I think the reason why I was disapointed by the fact that the parents or teachers were not developed more since those were the better established actors yet their characters were hardly developed at all in the film. I think what was cool about this film was it is a film for all ages. I saw this film for the first time with my parents saw the film, and my Grandma saw the film and all of us enjoyed the film",

            "content": "In 1985 there was a movie with Eric Stoltz and Cher called Mask, that featured a teenager with a really deformed face.  Now 32 years later we have Wonder, a movie about a boy whose face was born with some real deformity.  While in Mask, the main character had really learned to mostly deal with the reactions people have when seeing him, this movie's lead is younger and is going to public school for the first time in fifth grade.  Anytime you have a movie with kids as the central characters, the kid actors have to be really good and here for the most part they are.  The  film tells the story from the perspective of  many involved in this young boy's life, and that gives the  film much more credibility.  The core message of  acceptance is  really played out here, and you really are glad when it comes together in the end for this kid.   In Mask, the ending was much tougher because the boy didn't survive his afflictions medically.  Here there isn't  any of that.  What really makes the movie successful is  that it shows how we as parents can really struggle to show equal  love to our children, no matter what  the circumstances are. There are a few issues with the film, as it slows down a bunch in the second  act, but that is resolved with a good, even if it is hokey finish.  This is a good one for  the entire family to see together.",

            "content": "Rating:  A\n\nIn a Nutshell:  Based on the New York Times bestseller by R.J. Palacio, Wonderfeatures a talented cast in an uplifting, heartwarming, and inspiring movie that teaches us all to be a little more kind with one another.  \n\nAs Mr. Brown's precept on the chalkboard says, \"When given a choice between being right and being kind, choose kind.\"\n\nThe prosthetics and make-up used on Jacob Tremblay are truly a Wonder.  There is enough humor to balance out the emotional moments.  Speaking of emotional moments, you WILL cry.  A few times.  Bring tissue. \n\nThe kids who sat in the audience with me loved it.  It's a Wonder when both parents and kids can find a movie that they equally like.\n\nUplifting theme: \nWho do you aspire to be?\" - Mr. Brown (Daveed Diggs)\n\"You can't blend in if you were born to stand out.\" - Via ( the lovely Izabela Vidovic)\n\"Everyone deserves a standing ovation at least once in their lives.\" - Auggie\n\"Your deeds are your monuments.\" - Mr. Brown's Precept on the classroom wall.  Summer explains that it means, \"The things that we do are things that matter the most.\"  \n\"Oh Earth, you're too wonderful for anyone to realize you.\" - Via (while acting in the school play of Our Town.)\n\nThings I liked:\nJacob Tremblay does an incredible job as August Pullman.  He has developed quite an impressive filmography for such a young kid.  He starred in the Room, The Book of Henry, Shut In, Before I Wake [Blu-ray], and even The Smurfs 2.  His real sister, Emma, is also in the movie and plays \nI liked how the story is told through various people's perspective.  It's not just a movie about Auggie, but all of the characters who have their own challenges and growth.\nSome of the kids are really adorable, especially Jacob Tremblay (Auggie), Millie Davis (Summer), and Noah Jupe (who played Matt Damon's kid in Suburbicon.)\nI got a kick out of all the Star Wars references and the audience laughed every time Chewbaca showed up.\nSomeone makes a very kind sacrifice that truly impressed me.  I know, I know...it's fiction.\nThis movie hit theaters the same day as the JUSTICE LEAGUE.  You'll see a REAL Wonder Woman in the role of Auggie's mom, played by the wonderful Julia Roberts.   SPOILER:  She looks very comely in the beginning of the movie, but by the end, she appears more hip in an intentional \"don't judge people's appearances kind of way\" and a subtle evidence of how she was completely dedicated to Auggie when she homeschooled him and finally found herself by the end of the movie.\nAfter starring in Broadway's hit Hamilton (Original Broadway Cast Recording) [Clean], the talented Daveed Diggs has been busy working on films lately and has a small, but important role in this one.\n\n \n\nThings I didn't like:\nYeah, some of the teary moments are manipulative, but they still worked on me.\nClich\u00e9 standing ovation scenes that almost every middle-grade movie has lately.\nThe bully's parents were ridiculous.  The mom seemed over-the-top.  I sure hope parents like that don't actually exist.\nThey live in an expensive Brownstone in New York City.  What exactly does Owen Wilson's character do for a living?  We never learn that, but he's able to send Auggie to a private school and still have plenty of time to spend with his family.  Fiction, indeed.\n\nFunny lines:\n\"Have you ever thought of plastic surgery?\" - Jack Will (Noah Jupe)\n\"Dude!  This IS after plastic surgery!  It takes a lot of work to look this good.\" - Auggie\n\"What evil man invented Dodgeball?\" - Auggie\n\nInteresting lines:\n\"Why are you sitting here?\" - Auggie\n\"Because I want some nice friends for a change.\" - Summer\n\"Me too.\" - Auggie\n\"Good friends are worth defending.\" - Mr. Tushman (Mandy Patinkin)\n\"Not everything in the world is about you.\" - Via  \n\"Real friends are hard to find.\" - Auggie\n\"Auggie can't change the way he looks.  Maybe we can change the way we see.\" - Mr. Tushman\n\"We all have marks on our face.  This is the map that shows us where we're going and these are the marks that show where we've been.\" - Isabel Pullman   (I loved that sentiment, especially as I age and get more wrinkles!)\n\nTips for parents: \nBullying\nFist fight among boys\nSPOILER: A sad death\nJulia Roberts shows her kids a floppy disc and they have no idea what it is.  Ha ha\nTwo kids cheat during a test.\nThe middle school does the play Our Town.\"  Your kids may not know anything about it.  You should watch the old movie!\nA kid gets angry and throws something.\nThe disease that Auggie has is called mandibulofactuallyacial dystosis, also known as \"Treacher Collins syndrome.\"  Jacob Tremblay visited children who actually have it to prepare for his role as Auggie.\n\n\n\nMOVIE REVIEW MOM\n\n@trinaboice",

            "content": "It's truly a wonder that I went to go see Wonder, considering that I probably wouldn't watch a movie of its speed very often. However, thanks to my girlfriend Maria, I had the chance to see it during its opening weekend, and I'm happy that I did. Wonder tells the story of a young boy named Auggie who was born with numerous physical disabilities and a deformed face and is centered on his struggles as he tries to fit in at an ordinary school. While it's nothing groundbreaking for its genre, it serves up a hefty helping of emotions, both good and bad.\n\nWonder stars veteran actors Owen Wilson and Julia Roberts in the roles of the parents of Auggie, and they were my first favorite thing about the film. I don't really see Owen Wilson in movies anymore, and I don't know if that's because he hasn't been in any or because I haven't seen any of them. Regardless, I appreciated his presence in the film, and he does a great job portraying a funny, typical dad that we would all want to have around as our own parent. Julia Roberts also did a great job, and she especially shone in a couple of particularly emotional scenes. However, the real scene stealer her is Jacob Tremblay, the young actor that portrays Auggie. As an actor, and especially as a kid actor, he is solid in the role. I won't go as far as to say he is on the level of some of the outstanding child actors that I've seen in other films lately (like the great cast of It), but he is believable in the role and easy to get behind and support. He did a great job at showing emotions and making the audience care for him, and I think it's safe to say that Tremblay has a bright future in the film industry ahead of him. The supporting actors in the film are fine, although there were a couple of the kid actors portraying Auggie's classmates that were weak, especially when compared to Tremblay's performance.\n\nFor a movie of Wonder's type, the easiest way to judge its quality is by looking at the emotional reaction it draws from the audience, the lovability of its main characters, and the effectiveness with which it tells its story. Like I already mentioned, Auggie is easy to get behind. We all know, and some of us even were, the kid in school that got picked on because he or she were different. Obviously, Auggie's case in the film is on the extreme side, but that allows us as an audience to sympathize with his struggles. We root for him whenever he is down, we cheer for him whenever he is up. And while I never cried in the theater, there were plenty of moments when I felt genuinely happy or sad because of the way the film presented its main character's life. So, the film succeeds with the emotional reaction. I already touched on the second point, so I won't delve into detail, but I definitely loved all of the film's main characters, including Auggie, his family, and the people that eventually come to befriend him. The effectiveness of its storytelling is the one area where the film struggles. The one thing Wonder lacks is focus. While the scenes focusing on Auggie's life at school were all great, the film tries to dive into other storylines. Most of these storylines tie back into the primary story fairly smoothly, but others seemed unnecessary and distracting, serving only to extend the runtime. This doesn't fundamentally impact the overall quality of Wonder much, but it is still something to note.\n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed Wonder and the story that it told. It reminded me that dramedies made to evoke an emotional response aren't always cheesy or poorly made. Some are truly well-assembled and worth my time, and it makes me happy when I can find them. Wonder gets 4 out of 5 stars.",
