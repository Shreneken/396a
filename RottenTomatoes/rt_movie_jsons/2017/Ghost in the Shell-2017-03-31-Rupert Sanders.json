Sure, the characters may not be the most dynamic but I don't think that was supposed to be the point of this film. The storyline was strong enough to pull this through with an effective theme. The combination of a dirty bleak dystopia contrasted against an ultra-colourful future city of Hong Kong is a delight to become immersed in.",

The cast is good and does a good job with the material, I just wish that material was better. Some real conflict added to the story to hold my attention better.\n\nYou can read my full review here https://themoviemann.com/ghost-in-the-shell/",

That entire monologue was cut and right from that moment on, I knew this movie would become a severe disappointment.\n\nDo yourself a favor, if you want to watch the BEST version of Ghost in the Shell, watch the anime version, but skip the anime version that replaces certain assets with CGI bull shizz.

            "content": "I am not sure why I decided to watch this movie. I really didn't want to see it. I went into it expecting to be disappointed.\n\nAnd I wasn't. I am glad I watched it. It makes a few changes to the story that kind of separate it from the manga and the 1995 movie, and anyone who knows them will be uneasy for about the first hour. I wasn't enthusiastic about them. When I saw the changes being made to the story, especially how Puppet Master had been changed into a prototype of the type of cyborg Major was, now named Kuze, I was concerned. They seemed to have made some significant changes to the Puppet Master character. Instead of being a sentient AI that evolved from the network, he was now a cyborg that created his own network. I was seeing the warnings of a Hollywood fuck-up. Fortunately, that fuck-up didn't happen. I don't feel like they were completely faithful to the story, but they were certainly faithful to the characters and the setting and I think they did a really good job on this movie.\n\nScarlett Johanssen's performance; I'm on the fence about this. For a solid half of the movie, her performance seems to be not great. I can understand the robotic movements, considering the character has a robotic body, but she's a cyborg. Surely she hasn't forgotten how emotions work? But there are things later in the movie that would plainly explain why her behavior was so bland and emotionless throughout this first half. In the second half, she completely comes to life, and there is plenty of context in the movie for this shift in behavior and attitude. It's just that I can definitely see people losing enthusiasm and checking out of the movie due to the dry, almost lifeless acting of ScarJo in the first half.\n\nThere is a bit of racial thing that you'll miss if you're not paying attention. That being the notion of a major corporation basically kidnapping Japanese people, experimenting on them, and inserting their brains into robot bodies with very caucasian appearances. It didn't bother me but it occurs to me that some people might misconstrue what the movie was trying to say with that and be justifiably upset, particularly given the context of when the movie was made. To me, it just made the main villain look like even more of a dick.\n\nI won't talk about what happens at the end because I don't want to spoil it (and I do very much recommend this movie. I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.), but I would like to warn people that it doesn't have that deep, thought-provoking conclusion that the 95 anime did. Although I liked the ending and liked the decision they made, it still doesn't sit well with me. It asks a very different question about identity that, being fair, is deep and thoughtful in its own right, but it doesn't leave us with that deeper question.\n\nInstead, it seems that it answers that deeper question. This film, the anime, and the manga all inquire into the substance of a human. What makes us who we are? How do you define the human soul? At the end of this film, the Major clearly has the answer to these questions, whereas, in the anime and the manga, she's accepted that there is no real answer and that it's not a question to answer so much as an unknown possibility to explore. This movie doesn't try to be that deep, and thinking about it, it probably shouldn't. After all, the anime and manga already explore that question, and this film looks at it from a very different angle.\n\nWhile it may not be the Ghost in the Shell you're looking for, I think it's a good movie, and I'm convinced it's, importantly, good sci-fi. I didn't expect to say that about a live-action anime remake. Particularly this one.",

Instead of showing the viewer what world they are about to enter, they simply show the wiewer a text of the world they are entering. That to me is a big disconnect when watching a movie. I want see the world I'm entering, not real about it. And it's not like they couldn't have done that. After we meet our protagonist for the first time, we gets sent on a visual trip over the city the movie is taking place in. They film makers could have extended the visual trip and added in an explanatory monolog from the protagonist, instead of making the viewer read a potentialy good monolog.\n\nOther than the beginning.

There are no losses on the good guys' side, and thus lack of risk and consequence. Character development is mostly limited to Motoko and Batou, with some for Kuze. I was also turned off by some of the early unnecessary 'nudity', though perhaps that is inspired by the original.\nThere is not enough time to explore each of the ideas. The fact that memories can be implanted into regular humans should be thought provoking. The idea that a random hacker could temporarily take over a human should also invoke fear, but it does not. The reactions of people seem very cut, as in for time, thus not genuine. Side actors are not given any lines to make the world appear more real, making it feel more like a play for the main characters.\nFinally, the final battle seems the weakest of them all. The villain is too villainous, with their motivations not properly explained. They just want to crush the good guys.\n\nThere's a lot of flaws, even more on a closer inspection, but if you take it for what it is, and don't try to compare it to it's source material, it's enjoyable and quite good. \n\nA few of the most glaring plot holes (or not explained):\nThey don't explain why the corporate tech guy wants Motoko transferred to a government department as opposed to having her under his thumb instead. \nIf Kuze is enamoured of Killian, why does he risk killing her?\nWhen section 9 is 'burned' it doesn't make sense why the government wouldn't back them. The rest of the government is effectively absent this movie. \nKuze's abilities are mostly not explained. \nWhy does the Major basically turn herself in? What is the motivation, the reasoning behind it?\nIt's never really shown how Aramaki properly survives his assassination attempt.",

I got the sci-fi fix I needed with all the technological eye candy in this future mystery and its lavash appearance, but I agree with critics that the lead should have been an Asian actress. Her long lost cohort, suffering the same mistreatment and experimentation abuse, should have been Asian as well - to maintain the film's authenticity and its connection to the original source material.

I have watched the newer version of the series on Netflix and that familiarized me with all the characters and the plot structure of this version.

You would think eventually the baddies would figure out this a bad way to go about world domination.\nThe film kinda has a Blade Runner feel to it - futuristic, dark, rainy, Asian-influenced.

Since they tried to copy iconic scenes from the original in a cheap money grab from fans there is no reason NOT to compare the two.  Where the manga uses light and color as a character throughout, this version is a perpetual yawn fest of grey and black.  Where the original created characters that were sympathetic and terrifying, this one had a confusing series of characters for which one felt nothing as they were one-dimensional and undeveloped.  Where the original assumed its audience's intelligence and capacity to keep up, this one had to explain every darn thing, making it pedantic and annoying.  Where the pacing of scenes in the original builds in increasing tension to an amazing piece of carnage and violence, this one scrambled the order of scenes and added some unnecessary scenes of its own.  Take, for example, the trash-collector interrogation scene.  The manga has a poor shmoe sitting in a chair, surrounded by other humans as he stares at a photo of what he thinks is his family.  He still wears his gloves and there is a bandaid on his chin where he cut himself shaving.  When he breaks down into tears realizing that all memories of a loving family are illusory implants it is an extremely moving moment.  In this version he is isolated in a glass cage, wearing a straight jacket and shock color - like an animal.  There is no photograph to focus on, no other humans there to console (even while trying to interrogate), no sympathetic elements at all.  His hair and face are not that of the average Joe but instead have the long skanky hair and grisly demeanor of the typical Hollywood psychopath.  When he breaks his own neck using the shock collar attached to the ceiling our response is \"so what.  big deal.\"  Even Scarlet Johansen, though very attractive in the skin tight thermal optic suit, can do no more than knit her brows and tumble through the role with dull somnambulant freneticism.  What a turd of a movie.  The DVD box quotes \"Like nothing you've ever seen before\".  But indeed, there is something I've seen before that is shockingly similar and infinitely superior; it's called \"Ghost in the Shell\".",

Most of the complaints about this movie, are from people complaining that the main character is played by scarjo, but the whole premise of the movie, is that she's in the wrong body. \n\nLet me tell you something about this franchise. The main character, in universe, uses the single most mass-produced robot body on the planet, in order to best blend into a crowd as a spy. The most mass produced robot body on the planet, happens to be a white female. This is true in the anime. this is true in the manga. you do see the main character in this movie, BEFORE being given the robot scarjo body. guess what? She's actually asian. \n\nMore to the point, the biggest complaint about the anime that this is based on, is that the main character, major kusanagi, has the emotional range of scarlett johansson. So all in all, that was actually perfect casting, unless you're one of these people that thinks people's skin is important to who they are and what job they can do.\n\nAll that being said, I mentioned this is one of the only 3 good anime live action adaptations. It is the worst of the 3, but it is still good.  The reason it's the worst of the 3, is that it is basically a mashup of past plot-lines, and doesn't add anything new. It's got things taken shot for shot, from the original anime movie, and plot points taken verbatim from the first and second anime movies, and elements from the first and second season of the series 'stand alone complex' and '2nd gig'. it also includes a few elements from the manga that where never in any of the anime. It takes so much that nothing that happens is truly original, but it leaves so much out to have left open for a sequel that was just as much of a mashup. \n\nif you enjoy ghost in the shell, for more than just the 1995 anime movie, then you'll probably enjoy this. If you ONLY like the '95 anime movie, and don't like anything else from the franchise, you can probably give this a pass.",

People went berserk when they learned of her casting, and accused the film of being racist and offensive towards Japanese culture, but that mentality is flawed, and here's why:\nFirst of all, western cultures do NOT speak for the Japanese, and in fact, when they were asked how did they feel about Scarlett being cast, they thought she was a nice choice. Second, they also have a very interesting opinion on live-action anime remakes: Anime characters are very colorful and have bright eyes and hair, and when they're adapted to a live-action, they lose their by being portrayed by an average actor, so having a light-eyed woman like Scarlett on the role seems more fitting. \nIt's not the best film ever (maybe not even a good one), but it can still be very enjoyable when you have nothing to do.",

Almost all the interesting questions and plot twists of the original are lost, and there are no tachikomas, would you believe it. One would think the movie could be partially redeemed by the action sequences, but those are few and far between - the director takes too much time to develop the fake \"deep think\" part of the plot that is the movie's weakest point. Scarlett Johansson genuinely looks unsure about how is she supposed to act, which results in some wooden performances. The rest of the cast is not much better in this respect. Overall, this is suitable as an appetizer for those who never saw the anime. For those who saw the real deal, this film is just meh but ok to pass the time on a long flight or drive.",

So that makes it slightly less accessible in general, but the series' fans might also dock it for not including some of the other really cool sci-fi concepts/themes that have appeared over it's long history, making it MORE accessible in a somewhat contradictory fashion. The movie is it's own thing, faithful to the series, but not a faithful adaptation of the source. And I'm okay with that, because now the series is just that much larger, and I can still enjoy the other movies, the shows, and the manga. More Ghost in the Shell is a win in my book.  \n\nThe movie looked really great, and that alone makes this flick worth watching for a sci-fi fan. Scarlett Johansson may have been too big a celeb for the role, but she still did a good job. I thought the whitewashing of Major was very cleverly done.  \n\nI'm glad I bought this movie, even though I only did so because it was the best value to watch it.

            "content": "Awesome, technically sophisticated movie, that actually tries hard, to give credit to the original manga / anime sources. The futuristic world is a joy to look at. If you like to visit futuristic, slightly run-down urban worlds, like we've seen in \"Blade Runner\" or \"The Fifth Element\" with \"Matrix\"-like action pieces, this movie delivers! \n\nUnfortunately, there has been a campaign, with the intent to smear the movie's reputation by accusing it of \"whitewashing\", because the lead role was not given to an actor of Asian descent, but to Scarlett Johansson, who does a remarkable job of basically playing a cyborg. The subtle way she's moving, turning and shifting her weight, to appear more robot-like is great acting. But she's white and that's enough for a small, but very vocal minority, to \"hate\" on this magnificent piece of Sci-Fi action movie, which is kinda sad.\n\nIf you take the time to watch the extra footage, you will notice, how much the film makers actually tried to honour the source material, but the \"whitewashing\"-screamers don't care, they drank the \"more diversity\" (meaning: less whites!) Kool-Aid and decided, that this film has to be \"bad\" because of Hollywood's very relatable decision, to cast the movie's leading role with a well known, established actress, that is supposed to get as many people into the cinemas as possible, instead of some Asian no-name, what's the surprise?! That's just, how Hollywood works. \n\nAnd IS the main character really that much different from it's manga original?! \nJohansson plays a character, called \"Major\", who (SPOILER!!!) later finds out, that she's actually an Asian(!) girl, named Motoko Kusanagi, that has been recruited without her knowledge and been given a new body / shell. The whole story plays in a world, where everybody can swap and enhance their bodies with all sorts of technical and biomechanical gimmicks. \n\nSo an Asian character in an artificial white body is enough for many people to condemn and shun this beautiful film?! I'm far from being an expert for the original GITS manga / anime, I've seen the anime years ago and didn't like it much, but I'm not an anime fan at all. But from what I recall, the main character was a girl called \"Motoko Kusanagi\", who inhibits an artificial body, that looks pretty westernized to my eyes. But it's an artificial body anyway, she could appear as a person of colour or even as a man! So, where's the difference?! I'm sure, this whole \"whitewashing\" smear campaign has gotten way out of proportion, after having been completely unjustified, in the first place.\n\nAnother point of critique was, that the movie doesn't concentrate enough on the philosophical themes of GITS and doesn't dive deep enough into it. Again, I'm not an expert for the original, but those themes are in the movie, a lot of it, actually. Major is constantly searching for her humanity and there is some philosophical dialogue throughout the movie, but this is, first and foremost, a fast-paced action movie, not a full blown philosophical excourse in what makes us human. If you like those sort of themes, you might be better off by purchasing the mangas. I personally think, this movie has just the right amount of philosophical themes to think about afterwards, without spoiling the formidable action. I wouldn't want to sit through two hours of heavy philosophical discussion, I love crazy action and shootouts and the film delivers! \n\nIf you like Sci-Fi and masterfully executed action in a Blade Runner-like urban setting, you should give this film a chance, it is worth it and a great, but very, very underrated piece of Sci-Fi action cinema.",

            "content": "- Ghost in the Shell is a bold take on the anime classic. -\n\nWhen I heard Ghost in the Shell was being made into a live action film by an American film company, a familiar dread and joy descended. I was a Japanese anime-obsessed kid, and still feel a close guardedness about these stories. I knew it could be magical - or it could be a disaster. Turns out it was a bit of both.\n\nGhost in the Shell is a 1989 manga (Japanese comic) by Masamune Shirow. Its first adaptation, a 1995 film directed by the visionary Mamoru Oshii, is still considered an anime masterpiece. This new live action adaptation, directed by Rupert Sanders (Snow White and the Huntsman), though technically based on Shirow's manga, borrows much aesthetically from Oshii's adaptation.\n\nWe follow the story of Major (Scarlett Johansson), a cyborg composed of a human brain (ghost) implanted into a synthetic body (shell). As part of Section 9 - an elite anti-terrorism bureau - Major investigates the assassination of the head of the robotics company that created her, leading her down a path to uncovering her own identity.\n\nGhost in the Shell is guilty of some ogrish oversimplifications. The original circular narrative has been pushed into an audience-friendly open-ended story. The complex politics and philosophical mindbending I had hoped for are lacking.The villain Kuze (Michael Carmen Pitt), is aesthetically great, though not very interesting. But these changes come at the expense of many aspects of the film that are great.\n\nNew Port City, a place of gray skyscrapers and digital projections, is fully-realised, coherent and believable. Major's character is well-explored, as is her sidekick Batou's, played by the perfectly-cast Pilou Asb\u00e6k (Game of Thrones). Unfortunately, the rest of Section 9 hardly gets a look in except for when they need to show up for an important save-the-day moment.\n\nOkay. I know we now need to talk about the white elephant clogging up every conversation on this movie: Scarlett Johansson.\n\nThe backlash against casting Johansson as Major was huge. The reaction was largely knee-jerk, and though perhaps valid on some levels, is more complex than a simple \"Asian character turned white\" clickbait headline.\n\nJapan's relationship with its own identity is unique. Much of its art - especially manga and anime - is informed by their status as a post-apocalyptic society (in their case, post-WWII). Ghost in the Shell is set in a fictional Japan where firm national identity is lost, or at least evolved. Major's mind may be Japanese, but her body is post-Japan - a cultural blend built on a Japanese base, mirrored by the setting of New Port City.\n\nModern Japan has adopted elements of Western culture, including a trend of white Hollywood faces promoting beauty products. Ghost in the Shell projects this reality into the future. It doesn't pretend that it's fair because the multicultural makeup of the cast is never addressed or excused. Casting Johansson, in fact, goes some way to acknowledging the incorporation of Western beauty standards into a culturally changing Japan, which less than a century-and-a-half ago was still an isolated culture.\n\nJohansson's portrayal of a cyborg character is subtle and effective. Major's expression in Oshii's 1995 film is eerily blank in many scenes, and there is a clear effort on Johansson's part to emulate this. Ghost in the Shell calls attention to the irony that while Major's body is often exposed, it is not a sexual object, nor is she a sexual character. I found this at once jarring and refreshing.\n\nBefore watching, I fully expected to have the novelty of a woman's form thrust at me, but Sanders takes care to show us that though a body can be outwardly aesthetically attractive, we have the ability to disconnect desire from that body. Batou's uncomfortable reaction to her undressed body is because he is reminded that his friend is a cyborg. The camera neither lingers on curves nor allows us to view Major as a submissive character. Her body is an extension of the identity problem that the film deals with, albeit vaguely. That is not to say that sex and gender is ignored. Elements of the film, like creeps in a digital strip club, robotic geishas, and men in charge for the most part, paint a picture of a society that is, like ours, a little bit broken.\n\nThere are problems with Ghost in the Shell. Absolutely. In many ways it was inevitably doomed, having to satisfy the hardcore fans as well as unfamiliar audiences. It had to navigate minefields of culture and gender politics.\n\nFor me though, in the end, it was joy that won out over dread. Seeing flesh-and-blood (or silicone-and-circuits) versions of these characters brought on a heavy dose of nostalgia. Like all good cyberpunk, it was a beautiful and broken piece of film. If nothing else, it will promote discussions around the philosophy it glossed over and the controversies it created. And discussion is always a good thing.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/ghost-in-the-shell, and was written by Jack Gabriel.

The story they went with, the characters, and the overall feel of the movie does not convey this at all.\n\n\tIt is not who we are, or our physical traits or nationality or even our gender what make us human, it is our soul; or in this case our ghosts; and our experiences is what defines us and makes us human. That's what the movie tells you in words. But what I got from it is who you were biologically is what makes us human. That is totally off the mark to me what the animated movie was all about. The point of the animated movie was that no matter how mechanized we become as humans, we are still humans because our souls remain with us, even if that line gets blurred in the process.\n\n\tIn a perfect world; I could look at this movie and say \"You know, the adaptation doesn't always have to remain faithful to the source material. The director can put their own spin on what they believe the source material was going for in order to make it their own.\" But realistically, I look at this movie; and I can't help but feel disappointed.

Now what does that mean? It means you take that written or video work; and you can adapt it in order to make it your own without outright copying the work; or trying to claim it as your own. That would be plagiarizing, and that's bad. While the movie is a good adaptation by definition; in reality it is terrible. It is terrible because this movie already exists. The animated movie was done better, and the message of the work was portrayed better; and it really made you think. All this movie did was make me think I wasted my time watching this terrible movie. If you are going to make a live action adaptation of an animated work, you need to make it better than the original, or add something that further enhances the message.\n\n\tFor anyone who hasn't seen the animated movie; it is about a Section 9 operative named Major Kusanagi (everyone just calls her Major). Her job is to fight cyber terrorism. Now because this universe takes place in a world where a majority of the population has a lot of cybernetic enhancements, and androids are a very real thing; that definition extends to a lot of things. Like human brains being hacked as an example. A crime happens where an ambassador of some kind is having tea at a robot geisha house. He gets attacked and... oh wait; I confused the start of the animated movie with the animated series, and apparently so did the director. I also want to point out that the animated series (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) is different enough from the animated movie that it can be considered its own thing. Not only does it explain the universe of Ghost in the Shell a lot better than the movie does; it also gives bits of backstory of who the Major is.\n\n\tSo what the live action movie does is pick and choose scenes and events from both the animated movie and the animated series; and mashes it together to make a movie, but it doesn't do that well either. The Major is also apparently some Asian girl who was taken and made into a cyborg without consent by some big evil mega corporation named Hanka Corp or whatever. Doesn't really matter because the plot is adapted as poorly as the movie was.\n\n\tIn the animated movie, Section 9 is trying to find and capture a hacker named The Puppet Master. But you find out the hacker is actually a sentient AI made by Section 6, and they are trying to cover it up because somehow the AI escaped and is trying to survive. It also has the hots for the Major because it wants to meld their ghosts together to make something even better than human. Along the way they explore themes of human existence, and what it means to be human, are you still human if you copy all your memories as data and copy it to a cybernetic brain. The live action movie treats completely cybernetics humans like the Major as a rare thing, but in the animated movie it is pretty common, and a fully biological human with no enhancements is super rare; hence \"what is humanity\" is such a strong thing to ask in a world where cybernetic enhancements is commonplace.\n\n\tThe plot of the live action movie is The Major gets turned into a cyborg but has a human brain, and this is the start of them doing this. An employee of the company gets attacked and hacked because the aforementioned AI from the animated movie is trying to get information on all the employees involved in the project that involve The Major being created. But you find out he's not an AI but a failed version of the Major and he's trying to kill everyone involved in the project for revenge and blah blah blah. I feel like this plot mostly consists of getting all of the really amazing cinematography from both the animated series and the animated movie and making them look really amazing in live action. They do that pretty well, and the fighting scenes are pretty good as well. If this were a standalone movie it would actually be pretty good; but it can't be because it is being compared with the animated movie, and that is far superior.\n\n\tHer name in the movie and the animated series is Motoko Kusanagi, which is good but it just feels wrong because The Major on the animated movie knows who and what she is and is a total bad-ass. In this Scarlett Johansson does a really good job at being a bad-ass; and does her best with what she's got, but the character feels like she is written like a kid trying to get use to her new body. At one point she finds a human and is like \"oh so this is what a human feels like\". What?! No that's just stupid; but because they wrote her as having fake memories with a tragic backstory to motivate her, this could be seen as normal to her. The rest of the characters are OK. I could have gotten used to how Batou looked in this. But then they gave him his robot eyes and he just looks so stupid! What the hell guys, like it would have probably look better if they were bigger and more in his head like in the animated movie, but in this he just looks creepy and weird!!\n\n\tI came into this with an open mind, but I just couldn't take it by the end of it. They do such a horrible job with the plot and how they just insert different scenes from both the series and the animated movie; that at one point the movie became painful to watch. If you are curious to watch this movie just to see how they manage to ruin yet another adaptation to an animated property; then by all means watch this movie. But be warned, this movie will infuriate you. Or you'll just laugh the whole time. Hopefully you get that reaction from this; I certainly wish I had.",

Perhaps if they looked at films where the cast are entirely white, or ones where the only P.O.C are criminals as well as films like this or Doctor Strange for that matter it might seem like they genuinely care, as it is it just seems vindictive. As to the film, 5 out of 5, easily. Fantastic story, well retold by a brilliant cast and with outstanding effects, reminiscent of everything that was great about blade runner, while maintaining everything that makes Japanese storytelling so compulsive.

Not great, but not terrible, either. With a high-production value that allows for a stunningly built world with superb visuals and great attention to detail, as well as some pretty entertaining action sequences (including 4 or 5 of the most iconic moments from the original, which I was pleased to see), it has its merits. That being said, the negatives do outweigh the positives. The story is over-simplified, has an underwhelming conclusion, and contains none of the deeper meaning or philosophy of the original, something that is absolutely essential, as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, those are some big cons. What stood out the most, however, was just how badly the writers have not only failed to capture the individuality of Section 9's team members, but also the unique interactions between them - none of them have any depth or character; in fact, most of them didn't seem to matter, at all.\n\nNow the casting could be said to be somewhat questionable in a couple of instances, depending on who you ask, but the one that got the most heat prior to the film's release - Scarlett Johannson's casting -- turned out to be one of the better decisions once I discovered that they have found a plausible way around comparisons to the iconic Kusanagi. Apart from that, Pilou Asb\u00e6k made a pretty darn perfect Batou, and Beat Takeshi and Juliette Binoche are almost always great in whatever they do.\n\nAll in all, this is one of those instances where you're probably going to have a better time if you haven't seen the original, but for fans of it, this is never going to compare and can only ever amount to a weak copy, at best, of an outstanding original.",

The movie tries to go for an artificially lit, serene, techy sci-fi-look, and succeeds to be entirely consistent in that regard. The cybernetic bodysuit the protagonist wears during the entire movie, realistically damaged from time to time as well as able to morph into a translucent form when needed, receives quite some cinematographic focus, overall: this, along with the decors and suchlike, form a nice pair of visually appealing elements.\n\nOn the flip side, however, is the incredibly shallow story the film tries to convey. Sure, the premiss is cool: robot-girl in Japan fights bad people, then meets other bad people, then discovers the societal system was her real oppressor all along ... but that's it. Apart from this being oddly clich\u00e9 and hardly developing a single character, viewers might just never get the feeling the film takes off, as its plot is of such lacklustreness. What's more, is that, even though the story and characters barely evolve, the exposition of the beginning status quo is exponentially more difficult to fully understand, thus diminishing any possibly impactful story elements.\n\nAll-in-all, \"Ghost in the Shell\" deserves credit for its beautiful, serene, Japanese sci-fi-look, albeit whilst failing at basic storytelling.

The film was fine, but that does not mean so good. From the visuals to the performances, it sounded great. But the story wasn't. When the original concept was created nearly 30 years back, it fascinated people for being something new and powerful. But for the current world, for the current generation, it is just an ordinary sci-fi. All I say is it just came out at least 15 years late. So the 90s kids would have loved it!\n\nThe storyline was nothing, but a self-discovery of a half human, half machine. This has been the plot of hundreds of robot films. But it's just differently told. One of only kind, a human brain was saved after the severe accident and given an artificial body. Now she's known as Major fights the crime. But some day later, she's haunted by glitches in her vision which directly connected to her past that she does not remember. The rest of the film was finding the truth and other consequences, before it all ends.\n\nVisual effects were the only advantage for this film to come out in the present era. The rest of the film was simply okayish. I don't know what the original source fans say about it, but it is a one time watchable film. Otherwise, there are plenty of similar good films, like this is nothing much different than 'Robocop'. Or the recent TV series 'Westworld'. Scarlett Johansson could become a reason for some people to peek into it. The writing and direction were average. Watch and forget kind of film.\n\n5/10",

The revenge element crowbarred into the live action version just takes away from the overall goal of this story, to make the view ask \"What defines me?\".\n\nNext is the characture of the Major. The original Major was damaged by the fact that she not only allowed but asked to have her ghost transfefered to a synthetic body. Her fear of losing self was due to that fact.

Plus, the written exposition in the beginning and monologue at the end were not welcome IMO. It's not a superhero film. Didn't need that.\n\nCinematography: The camera was way too busy during scenes that could've used a long shot. Furthermore, they lost the ability to marry to location to the dialogue, as the originals and Blade Runner did before as a result of this need for flyovers and tracking shots.\n\nScore: I get that it's a police procedural, and they don't want to borrow too much from the originals, but less is more when dealing with existential issues, hence the minimalist approach taken by Mr. Kauai and Mr. Cronenweth in GITS and BR, respectively.\n\nOverall, I can't really fault one person or issue.

Set up in a way so that the events of the movie didn't quite go the way of the anime (to leave the writers more wiggle room to explore the character in future installments, clearly) it was still obviously being set so it could evolve in parallel with the anime. All the threads of the plot are heading in the same direction, just designed to get there a little slower. Had it not been in the center of a storm in a teacup then future movies would have been able to fill in the gaps. For example, Major doesn't immediately take up the antagonists offer to merge (which would have caused her to become someone else at the end of the movie), but it's clear he has become part of her, leaving the option open for them to merge later once we've had more time with Major. It was clear they wanted to do more than just a one off, but were instead hoping to create an interesting cyberpunk universe more fully exploring the major, but sadly we only saw one installment thanks to all the complaining. Any prospect of a followup was killed by insufferable whiners. It's funny but the people who complained about 'whitewashing' are pulling a 'scanner darkly' on themselves. The same people who need an American to be in a movie before they can relate to that movie, have now convinced themselves that there's a conspiracy and that the very American they need, who they themselves literally cause to be in the movie in the first place (by reasons of demographic), who is there specifically for them (for them to relate to).... is actually there for nefarious and sinister conspiracy reasons. Which is hilarious. American anime fans are going to create an environment in which less studios are willing to take the risk on live action versions of anime. Going forward, we're going to see a world in which movies won't feature anyone these people need in order to relate to it (so they can avoid accusations of whitewashing), and do poorly as a result, or are going to feature someone these audiences can relate to and but whined into oblivion. Talk about a lack of self awareness. American anime fans are setting themselves up to become the plot of a scanner darkly; where they think they have their sights trained on something sinister they can investigate but are actually investigating themselves.",

            "content": "Actors that become associated with action movies have a perennial staple of the movie industry since audiences have first sat in a darkened theater mesmerized by the moving images. Stories concerning adventure, action-driven plots with actors (or their stuntmen) performing amazingly dangerous feats seemingly impossible for a mortal man to endeavor much less pull off with perfect execution. Until rather recently the action star was an exclusively male-dominated profession. The rare woman undertaking this way of living remained mostly in the background fortunate if they were even mentioned in the general credits. Over the last decade or so these films have increasing feature popular actresses, many not only adapt with the requested strength, agility, and precision but also eminently attractive possessing a substantial amount of acting talents. One woman has carved out a niche as arguably the most talented and actress ibn action films including owning such a role in the most popular and lucrative set of films ever, the role of Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Scarlett Johansson. What differentiates Ms. Johansson from the plethora of young performers that see this as the way to achieve professional recognition, Ms. Johansson is first and foremost a serious actress. She has been carefully honing her craft since she was only ten years of age. By the time her dramatic breakout roles were released, she was seventeen and already a veteran of the business establishing herself as a journeywoman actor. Her big break can in a pair of films released close together, 'An American Rhapsody' and the sleeper hit and true classic, 'Ghost World.' In a movie such as the one under consideration here, 'Ghost in the Shell,' Ms. Johansson deports herself admirably once the action sequences have abated for a moment. When most movies have the audience taking a break while the exposition unfolds, Ms. Johannsson exhibits the ability to strengthen the emotional bond with the audience drawing them sufficiently into the story that they care about her character, not just the spectacular acts of agility experienced by the viewers. In her latest foray into the exciting venue of movies driven by explosive sequences that defy imagination and most of the Newtonian laws of nature. 'Ghost in the Machine is based on the popular manga story of the same name as well a previous animated feature length movie.\n\nMany movies begin as so many others making the temporal setting as 'shortly,' but what has become so evident that that nebulous description has taken on the distic0nctive nature of looming reality. Every generation of filmmakers has leveraged the newest technology exploiting the inevitable duality of paradigm shifting advancements. 'in the nineteenth-century electricity satisfied that role while in the fifties the latest technological plot devices were twofold, nascent use of atomic energy and the realistic potential of space exploration. Now, once again two converging branches of technological progress have eclipsed the other possible villain, quantum physics and giant leaps in the realization of artificial intelligence. The term used for the theorized point of convergence, the singularity. Within the context required for this story, it is the point where the organic and technological systems merge no longer distinguishable as separate. This theme is rapidly proliferating becoming the foundation for many of the most innovative and thought proving science fiction movies are dominating the cinematic landscape. 'Ghost in the Shell' infused the theme with a greater than usual consideration of one of the many questions raised by this technology. This story focuses on the psychological and emotional impact from the vantage point of one of the first to make the cybernetic migration. In this brave new world, cybernetic argumentation enhancing a myriad of human characteristics and abilities ranging from magnifying the senses, strength, and agility to providing implanted devices to communicate through the internet seamlessly. The Hanka Robotics Corporation is the leader in the development and deployment of new means of argumentation. One of the latest projects represented the pinnacle of cyborg development. They have created a fully enhanced, completely cybernetic human body conveniently referred to as 'The Shell'.in a specially designed cranial cavity the living brain of the subject was inserted. The human brain contains the total of some person's memories, feeling hopes and dreams, the individual's soul or ghost. Once the ghost merged with its shell, the result is the perfection of human achievement. The subject selected to participate in the experimental protocol was a young woman, Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson), who survived an accident which resulted in the death by drowning of both parents. With her ghost ensconced in the new shell was inducted into the corporation's anti-terrorist bureau Section 9, attaining the rank of Major. She led a team consisting of experienced field operatives, Batou (Batou and Togusa) and Togusa (Chin Han), under the direction of the Section Chief Daisuke Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano). This work took on a deeply personal motivation since her parent's deaths were a direct result of a terrorist attack.\n\nMajor's shell is not invincible, but it is incredibly durable, resistant to most forms of physical attack. When damaged it is a rather straightforward to repair. Visually the film is stunning, utilizing the latest innovations available to a modern filmmaker such as Rupert Sanders. He has a short resume at this point consisting mostly of 'Snow White and the Huntsman.' He does ha an innate talent for utilizing the latest Real 3D technology in the best way possible, to spice the proceedings adding precisely inserted sequences to maximize the visual intensity experienced by the audience. So many directors charging into using the illusion of depth surrendering to its seductive novelty factor permitting it to overwhelm the most important aspect of cinema is to tell a story. No matter how incredible the 3D effects might be, they can't supplant a strong, cohesive narrative. Mr. Sanders has demonstrated a natural knack to infuse the movie with just the proper amount to enhance the story not try to assume the responsibility to tell it. in many scenes, the effect is barely noticeable, just a hint of the characters and scenery existing or different, distinct planes. When certain crucial moments occur, such a significant battle that showcases both Major's enhancements and training and the vast range of argumentations available to her adversaries. In one scene, in particular, the incorporation of 3D is so critical to the scene, providing the vital nuances to make the scene important and noticeable to the viewers. Mira Killian\n\nThere has been a significant controversy over what is referred to as whitewashing, substituting Caucasian actors for ones intended to be of a specific ethnic origin. The role of Major was created by an Asian, so the expectations were for that to guide the casting of the part. Fans of the franchise were upset when a white Ms. Johansson. Some effort was made to address this issue, but for many, it was too little, too late. The context of the story had the donor, was Asian as validated by the fully Japanese biological mother of the subject and the photograph of her daughter seen in the senior woman's home. There was a certain subtle Asian component to Major's features but hardly enough to qualify as remaining true to the ethnic provisions of the source material. As this plot device is handled within the context of the story was achieved with a creative and nicely underplayed graduation to the psychological arc of the character. Major robbed of everything that was part of her pre-procedure life. Her memories were selectively erased, replaced with ones that supported the cover story devised by the team. Major's main physician, Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche), was always maternal and deeply concerned but was complicit in hiding the truth from Major. Dr. Dahlin (Anamaria Marinca), is the doctor charged with the responsibility of maintaining the physical integrity of the shell. The Doctor is constantly lighting a cigarette only to take a few drags only to snub it out. She also has a very specific argumentation designed to help her in her profession, the part of her face around the eyes could open up allowing for the addition of eyepieces that expedited her procedures.\n\nFans of the most recent megahit from HBO, 'Westworld' will recognize many of the procedural tools used to create and repair the shell. Robotically controlled micromanipulators serve as a 3D printer to carefully create the body, one molecular width at a time with the outer covering finalized with full immersion in a bath of some milky white liquid. Many of the visual components taken from several of the most iconic features in similar forms of science fiction. The initial occurrence found in the first look at the metropolitan setting. There are holographic billboards everywhere advertising a plethora of products and services. Some include holographic images of people several stories in height, for the Sci-Fi aficionado with a sharp eye you will notice one advertisement for Pan Am. Although the airline has been defunct for many years, one of oversized, animated billboards depicts an advertisement for Pan American Airways. An almost identical visual was used in one of the first films to include the singularity as the main theme, 'Blade Runner.' The use of Pan Am in that movie was an homage to one the most iconic and trailblazing science fiction films in the history of cinema, '2001: a Space Odyssey'. While always busy depicting a barrage of images the background never overpowers the narrative.\n\nThis movie was a cooperative effort by American and Japanese film studios and talent. The screenwriter, Jamie Moss, is also starting out in his chosen means of artistic expression. His previous screenplay was back in 2008 for a well-casted crime thriller, 'Street Kings.' Although the script is superficially simplistic, it does offer an ideal showcase for the deeply philosophical implications of the psychological and emotional effect such a separation of the brain from its normal organic surroundings into some entirely manufactured and artificial surroundings would have the sense of self-identification. This motif was lightly touched upon in the original 'Robo Cop' trilogy. But forms the foundation and very essence of the story including how these concerns affect the way the audience relates to the characters and their ability to relate, this is an underrated film that warrants a broader acceptance that it has received so far, one final note on the design. If you are going to create a shell making it look like the body of Ms. Johansson is certain to capture the attention of prospective customers and investors. I feel the lower than deserved rating is given online are from fans of the manga source material upset with the alterations necessitated by the change of medium. This is an inherently fundamental story crucial to introducing a new technological wonder as the latest two edge sword of progress. It deserves reinterpretation necessary to recognize it as a fundamental aspect of humanities continuing development.",

Seriously, her walks felt forced and not as robotic as David's from \"Prometheus.\" The whole plot twist and where the story was going can be seen from a mile away. It's not as intelligent or as original as it's counterpart because it doesn't question our reality if we were controlled by machines, but if it did, then this movie would have been a straight rip-off to \"Blade Runner.\" I guess that's why the story was weak?",

            "content": "Since the day it was announced Scarlett Johansson was cast as Motoko Kusanagi in a live-action adaptation of Ghost in the Shell (called by simply The Major or \"Mira\" in the movie), there were a lot of controversy around the whitewashing of an iconic manga character. But, guess what: it is Johansson's ghost who saves the movie from being a huge misfire.\nThe source material from the 1996's animated film of the same name is unique, with a sublime soul, hard philosophic questions and some amazing visuals. That said I must confess I was surprised by the choice of Rupert Sanders for the director's chair, since he showed so little as a storyteller in Snow White and the Huntsman and being able to tell a story and ask the audiences to think was something essential for a Ghost in the Shell adaptation. Well, the director might fail as a storyteller, but I must recognize it would be difficult to elevate such a weak screenplay. No matter what, Sanders amazes the audiences with the world he built on-screen: everything's so amazing and every detail is so polished, turning Ghost in the Shell into one of the most beautiful movies to look at in recent years. Production design, cinematography work and visual effects all work like an A-class symphony in order to create a visual feast on-screen - kudos for the amazing recreation of the shelling sequence!\nJust like I said, thank God they cast Scarlett Johansson in this one. While most of the critics who assumed to be fans of the original movie seem more concerned to keep the whitewashing controversy alive than to actually review the lead's performance, I must say I was quite impressed with Johansson once again. After a series of acting performances we can name \"What means to be human?\" composed by her turns in Her, Lucy and Under the Skin, I asked myself how could Johansson pull a different performance from a material that's similar to the previous ones... but she delivers one of the most refined performances in the last years of the sci-fi genre. She's a living weapon, for sure, but if you look at her eyes she shows she has a soul, an inner something that's far more complex and subjetive than the action sequences she's in. The script demands Johansson to ask the wrong questions, but in the quieter moments you understand she is haunted by her ghost. The actress proves she's a true star with this commanding performance, but I don't think it will be the acting turn that will give her the first Oscar nomination she's overdue for.\nThumbs up for Pilou Asb\u00e6k, who has great chemistry with the female lead and manages to make a huge impression everytime he's on-screen. The sound work is spectacular and some of the action scenes are thrilling too... Too bad it fails to capture the essence of its source material - a beautiful and visually magnetic shell but a ghost that only lives in Scarlett Johansson and not in the movie as a whole.\n.\n3/5\n.\nOriginal review: cinemaandpopcorn.blogspot.pt",

Unfortunately Johansson gives a rather lackluster performance, and the rest of the cast pretty weak.

This is about a girl that survived a near-death experience (Scarlett Johansson).  She gets saved and has her brain placed in a robot body (insert Sealab 2021 joke here).  She works for the police to take down dangerous criminals, but when is she going to learn about her true history?  Now I can't speak for the anime or the manga because I don't have the experience, nor do I have that kind of time.  Nevertheless, I figured I would still check out the big budget CliffsNotes of a largely popular property.  While I did like the underlying setup to this, it only ended up bringing an amnesia story we have seen countless times before to the table.  Now this may seem like loftier praise than I am actually giving, but in style, this reminded me a lot of Blade Runner.  This makes sense, though, as it is not all that uncommon for science fiction properties to borrow from one another, sometimes in theme and sometimes just in spirit.  Even though this has its own feel to it, you still can't shake what a retread this story is of many other superior films that you have seen before.  There have been many that have been complaining that this is another example of Hollywood whitewashing; I went into this knowing what the big third act twist was, and it should have made me angrier, but it didn't if I am being honest.  It just makes it feel more of a studio movie more than anything, which must be frustrating for the director, who clearly placed forth a lot of time and effort.  There is a lot about Ghost in the Shell that I feel gets lost in translation.  I like this story about where science ends and humanity begins, but it only plays a small part into this.  The script to this gets clunky, and this a one of the very rare movies where I think that Scarlett Johansson is pretty bad in her role, which is due with her being unsure of how to emote as a robotic character.  This is a no-win situation, because outsiders like me are going to be off put with the end product, and people who love the property are just going to feel like they should have just rewatched the originals that they fell in love with years ago.",

I would see the sequel because this is one of my genres.\n\nThe movie itself really isn't trend setting in this current day and age. I suspect the is a weird result of its original anime being so influential. Twenty plus years ago when it came out it was a relatively unusual, groundbreaking event, influencing such seminal works as The Matrix. The Matrix and other movies then in turn, influenced other movies making the tropes from the original GitS cliche.\n\nThe whole concept of exploring what makes you human really had nothing new  in this movie that you couldn't see in a dozen other movies that handled it a bit better.\n\nThat being said, Scarlett Johansson did a good job as the Major. I felt she did convey the spirit behind the character, but unfortunately not enough to raise the move above \"just ok\". I was especially pleased with Bataou and how he was portrayed, but once again they didn't give him a big enough part to do much more than give some interest. The rest of the characters were just blips in the movie.\n\nNow we get to the white washing. This clouded my opinion of the movie the whole time. The movie could have been done with any Japanese actress and I probably would have liked the movie better. Once again not because SJ did bad, but because the knowledge of the white washing left a bad taste in my mouth. I guess as I get older, the harder it is to look past stuff like that.\n\nThe movie did try to give a partial explanation of a white actress playing a Japanese character late in the movie, but it was less of any sort of in depth story idea, and rather something pieced in to explain why the major has a white body and not a Japanese body. Basically it was a reason they could use on why they went with SJ rather than it being a real plot point.\n\nThe good: Decent sci-fi, nice choreography, and an ok story.\n\nThe bad: White washing with a bit trope thrown in.",

The plot takes elements from the entire franchise, the original anime, the anime series and sequel to build a plot very similar to the original but more centered around the origin of the major while still presenting the concepts of personhood and what makes us human. Visuals are very well realized, with many scenes closely resembling the anime with avoiding looking overly bombastic or pushing us out of the suspense of disbelief. the movie has good casting and Johanson plays major very well, all tho it took me a moment to get on board with the portrayal of her cop buddy Batou, which was much easier when he got his new eyes. If you liked the anime full motion picture and dont expect this to be 1 to 1 carbon copy, you should enjoy this movie.",

I thought this movie had awesome visual effects that kept the resemblance of the anime look and feel. It also had a great story from start to finish. I was engaged the entire time. If I were a purest and one of my favorite movies was being redone, I suppose I'd be irritated if it didn't live up to my expectations as far as keeping to the same exact plot as the original, but I wouldn't vote down an otherwise great movie. Unfortunately I think that's what a lot of long time fans did. If you aren't familiar with any of the original Ghost in The Shell art work, then I think you'll find the film to be well worth a couple hours of your time. Now I'm thinking about how long I should wait before I watch it again.",
