I didn't give the movie 5 stars because the costumer needed to do some research or at least look at some pictures. They could have at least used an Army officer's uniform instead of an enlisted uniform for Col. Jim Johnson. An officer's uniform has a stripe on the cuff of the sleeves and stripes on the pants. Also, there is no unit patch on the left shoulder and no ribbons. Since a Colonel would have some ribbons, even if just the National Defense which is given to everyone. No nametag as the Army wears a name tag on the right pocket. At least splurge for a few ribbons, they are cheap. A complete omission of attention to detail. I have read that the \"colored\" coffee pot scene wasn't in the book and didn't happen. How much more was made up?",

However, I'm not too well versed for how it actually went down, so I won't make too many harsh judgements on that particular scene.

As African Americans, they shatter the barrier of entry to the hallowed halls of NASA, one of the crown jewels of the military industrial complex. As women they shatter the boys club of aerospace and rockets, where females were generally relegated to secretarial or clerical roles. Again as women, they shatter the upper echelons of scientific cliques, where many advanced subjects and challenges were deemed too difficult for females to undertake. This story needs to be told and retold. \nI literally cringed at the harsh treatment that these women faced in the bigoted time circa 1961. It seems the white establishment went out of their way to insult and humiliate their fellow African Americans, who showed amazing restraint and grace. It is quite alarming that a vast segment of America wants to return to this era, to put ‘minorities in their place', but thankfully that clock will not be rolled back any time soon.\nIt takes incredible courage to be the first, the pioneer and the vanguard, to pierce the veil of discrimination and shove your way into the room. The bravery of these women is exemplary and admirable through the ages. A must see movie to understand the cruelty of the past, and the possibilities born from courage and ambition. To me the historic space missions were a side story, the real subject was the journey of these strong, brave ladies of NASA.",

Other pluses from this film include the music and the cinematography.\n\nThere does seem to be a load of artistic license used, even for some important scenes, which is a little disappointing as it would've been nice to have a more truthful telling of this era in world history.

Sure, time is compressed from years and years of sterling work yet slow career progress on the part of the three main characters into what seems to be the preparation for a single mission, namely John Glenn's first orbital space-flight. And some supporting roles are several people conflated into a single representative character but the lead roles are played so brilliantly and the story developed so seamlessly that these can all be overlooked. Your emotions are played like a harp and yet it never feels as if the movie-makers are actively trying to pluck on heartstrings; they're just telling a story and you're along for the ride.

Здесь вам и церковь протестантов, и сер Мартин Лютер Кинг и советская угроза. Опять же любое достижение Советского Союза (СССР) воспринималось как выпад и нападение на бедную прибедную, многострадальную Америку. Раздувалось до невиданных масштабов и пичкалось, и смаковалось СМИ и другими издательствами, одурманивая народ нагнетая всё больше страха.\n\nСюжет и сценарий и соответственно тема скроена под «Оскар» и всевозможные награды. Гимн утверждения идёт максимально пафосно с долей помпезности. Женщина в высшей математике, женщина в космонавтике, женщина — гений! Темнокожее население ликует и улюлюкает под экстаз такого фильма. Тяжбы семейного быта, разбитого корыта, куча детей, и тут же добрая счастливая очередная мамочка. Которая и в горящую избу войдёт и коня на скаку «завалит». Чинит автомобиль и рулит своей жизнью как Шумахер (первоклассный гонщик).\n\nИ понятное дело, главные герои этого воспевания — всё те же темнокожие женщины. Фильм о женщинах и для женщин кухарок и всевозможных домашних наседок.

Данный фильм мог бы получиться хорошего уровня и быть весомым во всех смыслах, глядя на профессионально скроенные места, сюжет, юмор, основу реальных событий, живущих или живших людей, но уж чересчур эту приторную «конфету» пересластили.\n\nВсё же, фильм стоит одного просмотра. В лучшую сторону выделяю общую смотрибельность и лёгкость подачи. Многим такое кино даже понравиться. Мне же, эти моменты запороли классный фильм, который действительно мог бы быть шикарным.\n\nДля всех остальных в Европе и в остальном киношном мире фильм особой ценности не представляет!\n7 из 10",

            "content": "As well intentioned as this film is I don't find it to be a film that adds anything new to the traditional formula of the race relations drama with the prestige of being based on a true story. This certainly presents African-Americans in a far better light than the similarly condescending The Help (2011) but all of the clichés are still there and they aren't particularly entertaining. I can't see why this film was nominated for Best Picture when it is so milquetoast and boring, I suppose the Academy do love that, and when it is going up against competition like Manchester by the Sea (2016) and Arrival (2016).\n\nAfrican-American mathematicians Katherine G. Johnson, Taraji P. Henson, Dorothy Vaughan, Octavia Spencer, and Mary Jackson, Janelle Monáe, face racism as they work at the Langley Research Center and attempt to advance the Americans in the Space Race. Johnson begins a romance with Jim Johnson, Mahershala Ali, while facing off against colleague Paul Stafford, Jim Parsons. The women are helped by their white supervisor Al Harrison, Kevin Costner, who attempts to break down the barriers between black and white employees and battle prejudices. The launch is ultimately success due to the hard work of the mathematicians and the women receive recognition for their efforts.\n\nThe problem with the film is that so much of it feels contrived and too much like many, better films we have seen before. Spencer trots out the same old routine that we have seen in countless other films from The Soloist (2009) to Gifted\n(2017) and yet here something seems to be missing as even she seems tired with her sassiness and firm but fair persona. Henson and Monáe additionally struggle to inject their characters with any real life as they feel more like symbols than real, human characters even as we see snippets of their love lives and friendship. The writers, actors and the director Theodore Melfi, known for such highbrow fare as St. Vincent (2014), should have tried to add something new to a story that has been told a million times before and for now their workmanlike but unremarkable approach is just not good enough.\n\nThe only element of the film that is really of note is the score which is bright and lively and all of the things that the rest of the film really should be. We understand how empowered these women feel as catchy toe tappers play during scenes in which they make their way confidently through their workplace. In some ways the film reminded me of Working Girl (1988) in these moments as while none of the songs on the soundtrack even come close to rivaling \"Let the River Run\" by Carly Simon. Hans Zimmer is mostly known for his work on Christopher Nolan films and other serious dramas but he gets the cheery tone that this film needs just right and while he could be accused of ripping off Thomas Newman's score in Erin Brockovich (2000). I would happily remove Mica Levi's nomination for Jackie (2016) and replace it with a nomination for Zimmer's work in Hidden Figures.\n\nInspirational films about real life African-American figures that I would recommend watching before seeing this film include Rosewood (1997) and Ali (2001). Those films try to say something interesting about their main characters as we see Mann as a man who is a cause for change but also an overly violent man while we see what an impressive athlete Muhammad Ali was as well as being a drain on those around him in his personal life. It is disappointing how few films that are not about real African-Americans get wide recognition and I wish that more African-Americans were given opportunities to make films that take more risks than this paint by numbers biopic.\n\nThis is a film that won't offend anyone, to my knowledge, but it won't inspire any great passion in anybody or teach them anything they don't already know. The content of the film is rather boring despite it's worthiness and the performances are not the best of the admittedly talented actresses involved. See Moonlight (2016) or Fences (2016) if you want to see fascinating films that explore the struggles of being African-American.",

It's just so glossy and picture perfect it defies belief, I would've preferred to see something a little closer to reality, none of these characters seem to have a single substantive flaw even. I'm reminded of the film Imitation Game and how Alan Turing was a more interesting character because he was kind o an asshole.\n\nStill, these are minor gripes. I'm confident most people will enjoy this film as I did despite wishing they'd taken a few more risks. The film is worth watching to cement these three women in our collective memories at the very least.\n\n8/10 Stellar",

The real problem is that there are too many storylines and so few time to explore properly all of them. The result is not confusing, there are no rushed parts or plot points hardly comprehensible. The real problem of this is that the movie lose a lot of tension or emotional weight and stays pretty much superficial, with character construction that was simple and basic, nothing more. Also the beautiful messages about racial and gender equity feels superficial because of the poor time to explore them. On the other end the direction and the photography are functional, all the acting performances waere great and the music is suited. In conclusion it is a movie which probably most of the people will like (even strongly) but very few will love or hate (unless you are personally so into its inclusion message).",

Throughout the movie, three African American women break human history by working on NASAâ(TM)s project of getting a man into space while also struggling with racism and gender discrimination in the workplace. They defy all odds against them and become some of the most vital parts of the age of space. Hidden Figures is an inspirational, eye-opening story that can capture anyoneâ(TM)s attention. \n\nIn the beginning, the movie emphasizes the inequality the three women, Dorothy, Katherine, and Mary, dealt with in their computing jobs at NASA. After the Russians began making advancements in the race, the Flight Research Division needed Katherineâ(TM)s mathematical specialties for research documents. She started working with white, male mathematicians and engineers and this is where she had the most struggle with racism. She got no clearance, had separated bathrooms and supplies, and was treated with disrespect, yet she kept working until she earned the respect of everyone around her. \n\nDuring this time Mary applied to be an engineer which required her to go to an all-white college during the nights which also presented problems. After graduating from that college, she became NASAâ(TM)s first female African American engineer. While both Mary and Katherine struggled with discrimination in their new fields, Dorothy struggled with getting the raise she deserved. She did the work of a management job, but NASA didnâ(TM)t give âthe colored divisionâ? a supervisor. This caused her to use her skills to program one of the newest machines to NASA; the IBM machine which was too complicated and could not be programmed by anyone but Dorothy and her workers. \n\nHidden Figures used multiple perspectives and issues to create a clear idea of what life was during this time. It represented the changing of society, gender discrimination, racism, eagerness to discover more, family and love, and the idea of working hard will pay off. It can play with your emotions to form a connection with the protagonists and the victims so easily. If it had less talking and more clarity of some scenes, it would be a better movie for audiences of younger ages. But its maturity and deep scenes make it an extremely watchable film. \n\nThis captivating drama is so appealing to the audience and makes them feel like theyâ(TM)re getting a first-hand experience of discrimination. It can be enjoyed by men and women of all interests and almost all ages due to its humor and diversity of characters. It brings the viewers back to a time when discovery, the fight for equality, and family were the most important things to everyone.",

The Space Race was a competition between between the Soviet Union and The United States, during the cold war, to see who could reach space first. The United States \"won\" the race, but not everyone who helped is recognized. Hidden Figures is a film directed by Theodore Melfi, about three black women who worked behind the scenes to make sure John Glenn (Glen Powell) would get safely launched into space. These women were Katherine Johnson (Taraji Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe). Hidden Figures shows the true story of these three women and their battle against racism and sexism to be in the STEM field. Although it is an inspiring story, it doesn't tell the full truth.\nThe movie did tell the true stories of the three women and the NASA space launch. The three women all persevered to achieve their dreams. They worked as computers at the beginning of the movie, but all slowly worked their way to their dream jobs. Katherine Johnson was an extremely talented mathematician who ended up working with white men to calculate the correct landing spot for the Freedom 7. Mary Jackson is an aspiring engineer that struggles to work in her own field. Dorothy Vaughan runs the black computers and learns the code for the new IBM computer (IMDb). It shows the classic \"anything is possible\" kind of moral. \nThe movie in of itself wasn't terrible, but it was not fully historically correct. Many things happened in the movie that did not happen in real life. The film exaggerated the racism, by adding scenes that were not true, but made the plot and or movie more interesting. For example, many times we see that Johnson has to go across campus to use the colored restrooms, but this is untrue and did not really happen. So by Hollywood making the movie more dramatic, it made the movie less historically accurate. The characters also lacked depth and complexity. Most had one defining characteristic. For example, we notice that Jackson is sassy, and that is her defining characteristic (Oclese). It also is mainly focused on Johnson's story, even though ll of their stories are interesting, and all had the same determination to achieve their dreams. \nEven with all of the things that were inaccurate, it doesn't mean that the movie was necessarily bad. It was still a great, inspiring film. This film is great for most age groups, the youngest probably around twelve. It is great for anyone to see this and be inspired, especially young women children. It is important for people to see that being prejudice, rasict or sexixst will not and can not stop anyone.",

Hidden Figures, directed by American screenwriter and producer Theodore Melfi, illustrates the experiences of African American women Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson during the 1960s. Based on a true story, the three women worked at NASA, serving as the brains behind one of the most monumental operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. This remarkable achievement restored the nation's confidence, turned around the space race, and galvanized the world. The protagonist, Katherine Johnson, was the first of the trio to work at the NASA space test group because she was incredible at mathematics. Throughout the film, the visionary trio battles with not only personal affairs but the harsh realization of segregation and gender inequality throughout the workplace. Hidden Figures is a fascinating and inspiring film that keeps the audience enlightened and engaged.\n\nKatherine Johnson gets the opportunity to join the big leagues, where decisions are made, and she can finally explore her talent in mathematics. Unfortunately for her, she struggles through tough times along the way. No 'colored' men had ever been selected to join the test group, let alone 'colored' women. Katherine had to use a separate empty kettle for her tea and to \"relieve herself,\" she had to travel half-a-mile away to a building that had the appropriate restroom for her. Despite all of these challenges, her brilliance in mathematics made sure she shined the brightest among her white male colleagues. The three female mathematicians and physicists, also known as 'human computers,' were some of the most substantial brains behind NASA greatest accomplishment. As Katherine Johnson was out working at the space test group, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson were out making their dreams come true. Dorothy battles with her condescending boss, Vivian Mitchell, to become the supervisor in NASA's West Area Computing division, and Mary takes to the court in an attempt to become the first female African American engineer. \n\nTheodore Melfi does an outstanding job of keeping the plot easy to follow while also portraying emotion. Even though overcoming challenges is an all-too-familiar topic, Hidden Figures manages to tell an inspiring story. In one of the last scenes of the film, John Glenn commands that he will not complete his mission on orbiting the earth unless Katherine Johnson checks the numbers. He says, \"Get the girl to check the numbers\" and \"If she says the numbers are good, I am ready to go\" (Hidden Figures). This is an inspiring moment in the film because it shows how Glenn trusts Katherine calculations, despite her being an African American women, and this could mean the difference between life or death for him. Glenn saw the brilliance in Katherine and knew the potential she had.  \n\nHidden Figures is a fascinating film that tells an inspiring story. Theodore Melfi illustrates the experiences of three African American women overcoming segregation and gender inequality not by violence and protest, but with skill and persistence. The film teaches the audience not to judge a person by the color of her skin, but by her character and the knowledge she owns. People ages ten and up who love history and are interested in an inspirational plot should watch Hidden Figures.",

Hidden Figure is a movie directed by Donna Gigliotti. It takes place in the 1950s, and it takes a glance at what it was like to be an African American woman working for the NASA program. This movie showcases three African American women who take on the endeavors of working for NASA and the racial bias that they encounter. Hidden Figures was an eye-catching, storytelling movie. However, it lacked a real sense that others movies have.\n   Early in the movie, the director did an excellent job at capturing the viewer by adding Katherineï¿ 1/2(TM)s childhood and how she became a mathematician.  The protagonist, Katherine Harrison, started her life from humble beginnings. When she was young, she was a math prodigy and was accepted into some of the best schools in the country. Twenty years later,  Katherine became one of the only few African Americans working for NASA. Katherine was one of the best mathematicians at NASA, but many of her white counterparts did not want to recognize her abilities. She was one of the only African Americans working at NASA that had a significant impact on the space program.   \nKatherine occupied one of the highest paying jobs at NASA, predicting rocket trajectory. During her time there, many of her white counterparts did not believe that she had the capabilities to be there. Furthermore, they felt that she was inferior to them. The movie does a great job of capturing the viewer and getting them interested in the plot. The film mainly captures Katherineï¿ 1/2(TM)s side of working at NASA and did a great job portraying the overt racism that was seen in the workforce. Although the movie was detailed and right to the point it lacked in some areas, such as it did not feel realistic. Harrison was asked a question about her time working in NASA, and she said she never experienced racism. The premise of this movie is based on the issue of gender bias and bigotry. The fact that she stated that she did not experience racism makes the film inaccurate.\nAlthough this novel creates acknowledges what it was like to be an African American women in the 1950s, it was inaccurate in its storytelling. These young women did the unthinkable during this time by and becoming some of the best African Americans women working at NASA. This movie shows that success can be achieved through the roughest of times even when gender bias and racism are not in their favor. This was a fascinating film that would be great for adolescents and adults. It would not appeal to children under the age of 12 because it would be hard for them to understand the racism aspect of the movie. \n\n\n\n\tRating: 4.5/5",

A second prejudice existed against women in the scientific/engineering space program at NASA. This movie is about three outstanding women who wanted to make a difference in their community. Katherine Johnson, the main character, worked on the calculations that allowed John Glenn to orbit the earth. This was a fascinating movie, and it proved that women during this time were capable of achieving goals that were only assigned to men. It was even harder for African- American women to succeed.\n\tKatherine Johnson, a brilliant mathematician, was selected to join the space test group because she was one of the few individuals who knew how to apply analytical geometry. Although she experienced many challenges, for example, Katherine was asked to examine and check her male coworkers math calculations. Her male coworkers decided to black out this information by telling her it was classified. She overcame this problem by holding the paper up to the light. Also, when Katherine wanted a cup of coffee on the first day of her new job, she had to use a separate coffee pot because of segregation. Finally, when Katherine had to use the bathroom, she would have to run to the other building where all the African American women worked to relieve herself. Katherineï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s boss later tore down the bathroom sign because he believed that African- American women should be equal, and he didnï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t want her to waste valuable calculation time running back and forth to use facilities every day.  \n\tThe title of the movie is Hidden Figures; this was interesting because the African- American women who worked at NASA were ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2hidden Figuresï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? during the 1960s. These three main women were the hidden keys for success. This film was fantastic and was written about prejudice and segregation which is still a problem that needs to be resolved to this day. More truthful information about the contributions of these dedicated women would have inspired and benefited young girls of all colors to study math, science, and engineering. Katherine Johnson and the other two women strived for what they believed in. This inspires all of us, and all ages (school age and up) should see this movie.",

Although the movie does not completely portray the brilliance of the three ladies and is somewhat historically inaccurate, Hidden Figures is an inspiring movie, based on a true story about overcoming discrimination and ï¿ 1/2reaching for the stars.ï¿ 1/2Â?\nHidden Figures tells the tale of three African American women working for NASA in 1962, Katherine Goble, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, who work to make John Glenn become the first American man in space. Katherine Goble is a genius mathematician who is promoted from being a computer to working with white men to calculate the landing point for John Glennï¿ 1/2(TM)s spaceship. Mary Jackson is an engineer who dreams of working on the shuttle but must win the right to attend night school so she can learn the necessary skills. Dorothy Vaughan is the unofficial supervisor of the African-American computers who strives to be recognized with the title and pay of a supervisor.  The three women have to defy stereotypes to win their co-worker and bossesï¿ 1/2(TM) approval and achieve their dreams.\nThe movie was engaging and inspiring in multiple ways. One of the most impressive parts of the film is how real footage from the Friendship 7 launch in 1962 was used (Scubafiend). The historical accuracy added some extra detail to the movie and made it more enjoyable to watch. Also, the use of symbolism in the lot, such as the ï¿ 1/2pearl necklaceï¿ 1/2Â? that Katherine Goble does not own, added an extra layer of depth to the script (JRS). The three women were so inspiring, it would have been tough to create a story that does not demonstrate their perseverance and strength. The movie had a clear message and anyone would be in awe of Goble, Vaughan, and Jacksonï¿ 1/2(TM)s accomplishments after watching it.\nWhile much of the Hidden Figures story is true to real events, many of the details were made up by Hollywood to make the plot more appealing. One of the most memorable parts of the movie occurs when Katherine Goble has to run to the ï¿ 1/2coloredï¿ 1/2Â? restrooms across the NASA campus every day, but this is fictional, as are the characters of  Al Harrison and Paul Stafford to show the racism and sexism of the time (JRS). Also, the characters in the movie are slightly one-sided and do not have many personality traits (Olcese). These women were geniuses, and do not deserve to be portrayed as any less. Finally, the movie focuses mainly on Katherine Goble story. Although it was possibly the most interesting, it made it seem that Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson did not work as hard as she did to achieve her dreams, when all three women were extremely perseverant (Olcese). If one is looking for a more historically accurate version of Hidden Figures, they should read the book Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly.\nHidden Figures had an inspiring moral and was entertaining to watch. Although some details were made up, this was done to make the storyline more interesting, and photos of the real people behind the stories were shown at the end of the movie. While the message to ï¿ 1/2never underestimate othersï¿ 1/2Â? is clear, the story could have had more complex characters and gone more in-depth with Jackson and Vaughanï¿ 1/2(TM)s stories if it were longer. These womenï¿ 1/2(TM)s astonishing history is too complicated to be summed up in two hours. Hidden Figures should be recommended to any age group, especially for younger children, because it is important for children to see how unfair discrimination is, and the inspirational message to ï¿ 1/2reach for the stars,ï¿ 1/2Â? in this case, literally, are fit for anyone.",

Loosely based on the novel ï¿ 1/2 1/2Hidden Figuresï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and actual events, the movie follows African-American NASA (Formerly known as NACA) human computers, Katherine Johnson (played by Golden Globe-winning actress Taraji P. Henson.), Mary Jackson (played by singer, songwriter, and actress, Janelle MonÃ¡e), and Dorothy Vaughan (portrayed by Oscar-winning actress, Octavia Spencer.). The three women face racism and sexism throughout the movie, encouraging others to fight for what they believe in, work hard, and take a stand. The cinematic gem features a star-studded female cast that makes Hidden Figures a true work of female empowerment in Hollywood, changing the movie from decent to excellent.\nThe 2016 historical fiction movie highlights the racism and sexism of the 1960s. The main three characters, Katherine, Mary, and Dorothy, know this all too well. Katherine becomes a human computer in the year 1961 in the film and experiences racism as well as sexism in the workplace by the fictional character, Paul Stafford. portrayed by Primetime Emmy-winning actor Jim Parsons. Stafford is Katherine's co-worker, and the two are not the best of friends when she arrives. Katherine is often told that she is not fit to be in her position, a useless employee and among other racist and sexist remarks. Parsonsï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM) character ï¿ 1/2 1/2shows audiences the symbolism of sexism and racism in the 1950sï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â?. (Hollywood vs. History) The characters portrayal gives us the emotion and depth needed to make Katherineï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s character work harder than before to prove she belongs, giving viewers a real cinematic view of female empowerment. \nActresses, Janelle MonÃ¡e and Octavia Spencerï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s characters are no stranger to discrimination as well. Their characters Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan show the female audience empowerment. Mary Jackson is a female engineer and computer who takes her career to new heights when she goes to court for fighting for something she believed in. When Jackson is denied access to further her education because she is an African American woman, she takes a stand and petitions the court to level the playfield. Janelle MonÃ¡eï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s acting skills in these scenes give audiences the emotion, pain, and triumph needed to make her character embody a pure work of female empowerment. Dorothy Vaughan does the same as well when being chosen for re-assignment. Vaughan faces a difficult decision and must choose between herself and her fellow computers. Vaughan declines the re-assignment and gives her supervisor an ultimatum that she can only take the job if she can bring her equally qualified co-workers with her. This provides fans that female empowerment and diversity element that we need to see more of in Hollywood. Vaughan doesnï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)t only take the promotion for herself but expands the job to include her co-workers. Vaughan shows viewers that one African American women advancing in the workforce is a great achievement, but multiple African American women moving up in the male-dominated workforce is true female empowerment for all. \nAltogether the Film Hidden Figures is an outstanding film that all ages should watch. The cinematic gem gives audiences a perspective of female empowerment and diversity rather than historical fiction, making it a stellar film for all audiences to enjoy.",

The trio immensely contributed in launching astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The movie is loosely based on the non-fiction novel, Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly. Although there are many informative moments throughout the movie, it deviates slightly from the actual historical events.\n\nOne of the essential characters in this story, Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), is not a real person. His role is based on Robert C. Gilruth, the head of the Space Task Group at the NASA Langley Research Center (Loff). In Hidden Figures, Al Harrison is not focused on the prevalence of racism in the United States during the 1960s - He, along with many others, is solely concentrated on getting a man into orbit (Krizanovich). \n\nAlong with this, one of the most memorable scenes of Hidden Figures occurred when the Al Harrison smashed down the Colored Ladies Room bathroom sign with a crowbar. This transpires after Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), \"returns to her desk from a bathroom break, drenched after running for half an hour in the rain,\" (Thomas). Though this is a dramatic and substantial scene in Hidden Figures, this did not happen. \n\nA similar misrepresentation occurs in Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race. The novel states that Katherine Johnson \"refused to so much as enter the Colored bathrooms,\" and she was never forced to, either. Dexter Thomas, a VICE news correspondent, interviewed Katherine Jackson herself, who stated: \"I just went on in the white one.\"\n\nAlthough the movie portrays various delusive events, it comprises the reality of controversial topics such as racism and sexism, particularly during the '60s. It also discloses how individuals conquered these adversities.  This movie would most likely appeal to adolescent viewers who enjoy historical dramas. Viewers who are not interested in aeronautics may not find this movie about space science engaging. Overall, Hidden Figures is a wonderful film about self-actualization and resilience.   \n\nRating: 3.0/ 5.0",

This movie shows the progress of three African American women who work at the headquarters for NASA in Hampton, Va. These women are striving to create the most significant space launch in history, the launch of John Glenn into orbit. This film occurs during the time of segregation and workplace sexism was prevalent, but more specifically it tackles African American women's rights. The three African American women's lives the movie follows are Katherine G. Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. In the film, they were referred to as \"computers,\" as if they are simply machines, not actual people. Hidden Figures was a compelling and moving story; although it did not portray history extremely well, as there is a Hollywood touch added to the movie, and some scenes are not entirely historically correct. \n\nThe movie's main storyline is the division between the two colored skins, the blacks and whites, and how differently they were treated. In the 1960s, the white colored skinned people got treated like they were superior and people with darker skin were considered low-quality. The movie does not portray exactly the real historical events that happened, and some of the most powerful parts in the movie that were added in were not actually true events. Kevin Costner's character, Al Harrison, was not a real character. Three different directors at NASA inspired his character. Al Harrison was a composition character. Another scene in the movie that is false occurred when the white male workers thought Katherine G. Johnson was the janitor there to empty garbage cans. That was not true. That incident never happened. This was an element of fiction created by the filmmakers. Jim Parsons' character, NASA engineer Paul Stafford, was also a fictional character. He was designed into the movie to represent certain racist and sexist attitudes that existed during the 1960s. He then has a change of heart and brings Katherine a cup of coffee later. This character did show how terrible people were back then, and how people can change, but it was not the real events. These scenes are all fiction. While compelling, however, they were not real. \n\nThe most powerful scene in Hidden Figures was Al Harrison knocking down the white women's bathroom and making it a bathroom for everyone, coloreds included, so Katherine did not have to run half a mile to a different wing of the building, occasionally even in the rain just to go the restroom. That is all fake too. Katherine ignored the rules and still used the women's restroom in her wing. This scene signifies the experience Mary Jackson had when she worked for NASA. Also, there is no record of anyone ever personally taking down restroom signs. All these scenes are meaningful and valuable to the story, but leaving them out would have made the story exceptional. Viewers would know the real story and understand what actually happened to those women. Some viewers disagree and like having those fictional characters or scenes in the movie because it gives more examples of what it was like back then. Also, some people believe it captures the struggles of African American women more. Although, viewers should consider that if they want to see the actual battles of segregation in the 1960s, seeing the true story would show more. \n\nHidden Figures is a such a touching movie because it tells the story of how three strong African American women stood up to being kept down. They refused to go unnoticed. They demanded to be seen as equals to their white counterparts. There was nothing easy about what they did, but they did it anyway. Katherine G. Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan are such inspirational women and have set an example for future women to follow. This movie would be recommended more towards women because Hidden Figures is about the struggles women faced, but more specifically African American women. Women would feel very connected to this movie and understand what they are going through.  Even though this movie was so enjoyable to watch, had Hidden Figures followed the original storyline, it would have been exceptional. All being said, this movie deserves a 3.5/5 star rating.",

            "content": "Exaggeration or Excellence\n\nWhat makes a film excellent? Hidden Figures, directed by Ted Melfi, revolves around three black women named Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson who worked at NASA and were integral to the success of many of the Apollo missions including the one that sent John Glenn into space, which caused him to be the first American to orbit the Earth. Hidden Figures is a critically acclaimed movie that was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. Hidden Figures was undoubtedly an enlightening movie that captivated its audience, but it also implemented exaggeration to entertain viewers.\n\nFew movies based on true stories maintain the delicate balance of facts and personal struggles like the film Hidden Figures does. The difficult tasks that Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson completed while working at NASA would not have been properly represented had the film creators decided to neglect the scientific and mathematical aspects of these women's careers.  Despite the complicated ideas that circulated throughout NASA, Hidden Figures was able to explain the basic function of each of the main character's jobs in simple yet sufficient enough detail so that the audience could appreciate each women's contributions to the space program. This movie induced feelings of inspiration and satisfaction to many of its viewers as it highlighted how Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan overcame various struggles such as sexism and racism to achieve success in their fields. If nothing else, Hidden Figures opened its audience's eyes to the idea that the space program at the highest level was not exclusively run by the white man, and everyone can make an impact in any field.\n\nMovies based on reality are subject to a certain amount of authenticity, and authenticity is one of the major reasons viewers decided to watch Hidden Figures. However, under further scrutiny,  the film Hidden Figures proved to have many inaccuracies. Arguably the most important exaggeration included the idea that Katherine Johnson suffered large amounts of explicit racism while working when in reality Katherine Johnson herself admitted that racism was not prevalent at NASA. Movies based on true stories are held accountable to a certain amount of accuracy, yet the filmmakers decided to add false ideas into the movie to make it more entertaining. There are times and places for artistic license, but it should be used to accentuate details not falsify facts. Developing a plot in a movie of this genre needs to be based on truth, and the film Hidden Figures was not able to meet that requirement.\n\nHidden Figures was an enthralling movie despite using false information to create conflict and entertain viewers. The film showcased Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Katherine Johnson's accomplishments with an appropriate amount of detail. However, the producers detracted from the value of the movie by trying to create a problem that did not even exist. Hidden Figures is the perfect movie for anyone who wants to understand the contributions that these women made to America, but not for those wishing to understand the full, accurate story of their lives. Many people can make an entertaining fictional film, but those who create movies that revolve around the lives of real people need to be held to a higher standard.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is a dramatic historical film that gathers what life was like in the early to mid 1900s for African American women, and how the three protagonists push through discrimination with hard work and bravery, eventually gaining respect as workers in NASA (then called NACA). Despite both African Americans and woman being frowned upon by society, these courageous people fought for civil rights and a place among the workers at NASA, in a mission to reach space and bring an astronaut back home. Hidden Figures, based on a book sharing the same name, being published the year as the movie, has aspects of civil rights and courage that inspires the watchers, however is dramatized from the original plotline.\n\n\tThe protagonists, Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, work as calculators for NASA, being called \"computers\". They would calculate some of the most crucial problems in NASA, though being constantly persecuted for being African American women. Eventually, the main protagonist, Katherine, gets a promotion from computers to work on directly checking and creating equations for NASA to confirm calculations are correct. In the movie, she arrives to her new office area to find that she is the only African American and woman there, with a separate low-quality coffee machine than the others, and only obtaining only censored writings due to \"confidentiality\". This is however different from what the story is based off of. Originally, Katherine actually had minimal discrimination compared to what they had to go through in order to get to NASA in the first place. Still, to make the movie more dramatic, and express the troubles the protagonists had before being at NASA,  they exaggerated NASA's dislike African American women in the movie.\n\nOther than the movies' flaws with being historically inaccurate, there were general themes, such as American hate and suspicion towards the recently launched Russian satellite known as Sputnik, that were fairly accurate a represented how the beliefs from the mid 1900s was different from today. Katherine Johnson, who is still alive at age over 100 years old, stated that \"[The Hidden Figures movie] was well done. The three leading ladies did an excellent job portraying us,\" according to The Los Angeles Times. This shows the movies accuracies with the bravery and courage of the original women at NASA, as can be seen frequently in the movie, such as when Mary Jackson makes a speech to a judge in order to attend an all-white school, one of the only things limiting her from proceeding to become a NASA engineer4.\n\nThe movie was overall entertaining, dramatic, and historically accurate in terms of themes, however being over-dramatized. The original women who worked at NASA were well portrayed, to bring together an inspiring film. The movie earns a well-deserved 4.5/5 stars for historical theme accuracy, entertainment, and being an inspiring tale of the brave women working at NASA.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures:  Discrimination and Determination\nThe Realities of NASA\n\nHidden Figures is a veritable movie, taking place in the early sixties, where three black women were discriminated against their race, and gender in the NASA computers division. The film is well characterized by the actors, with a powerfully written script by the director, Allison Schroeder.  This historical movie is based on the nonfiction book, Hidden Figures, by Margot Lee Shetterly. Although countable events that took place were real, the movie would not have been entertaining without further conflict.  The actors portray the hardships of being âcomputersâ? at NASA, and their struggles to fight for civil rights and displayed tough female leads.  \n\nThis well written, award-winning historical movie is no documentary. For example, the three main actors, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson were depicted as being close friends. In the actual story, they were colleagues who supported one's dreams, but they never were close (Schroeder). These untrue events that are claimed to be right continue. For instance, Katherine Johnsonâ(TM)s scene when she ran all the way to the African American womenâ(TM)s lavatory never happened. Katherine Johnson was not the one running across the branch, Mary Jackson was. Jacksonâ(TM)s story of running to a bathroom with a colored sign on it is entirely different from the story.  Johnson had explained that she did not feel discriminated against, even using the white washrooms, (Harris). Also, Al Harrison, the head of the space program, melodramatic scene of hammering the sign in front of the ladies restroom was fictional. It seems as though the director added this dramatized scene  to raise the conflict of the story. Furthermore, without rising action, the storyline would have been disinteresting, and would not have been an award-winning film.\n\nThe three African American women faced many challenges through NASA. The movie depicts how the women were discriminated against in the 1960s. They were discriminated not just by race but by gender. For example, Dorothy Vaughan leads a group of African American women to the mainframe computer room. She saw this as an opportunity for her fellow African American colleagues to advance. This symbolizes the civil rights movement. In this time in history, women mainly worked as receptionists, and their talents for mathematics and science were shut down. Katherine Johnson took her chance and upgraded from being a human computer to working on the mathematics behind the Mercury 7 mission. She was highly discriminated against by her male colleagues. The movie shows a clear image of how Johnson struggled to work in a large room of white men. A clear vision the film tried to explain was the scene where Paul Stafford, a white engineer, forbade Johnson to sit in on a board meeting. Al Harrison, the boss, shut down his sexist and racist comments by allowing her to sit in on the meeting. Johnson even did calculations in front of the representatives and got assigned the Mercury 7 launch. All three of the women have had amazing accomplishments while facing discrimination and the harsh Jim Crow Laws.\n\nThis movie attempts to demonstrate the hardships the African American women endured. Hidden Figures does well to characterize the three astonishing women and their marvelous work. Although it is not historical in the least, the plot appeals to younger audiences (adolescent) as well as older adults. This movie will likely not appeal to history buffs who will not agree with the events that took place. This reason is that the film is not historically correct but still gives a vivid image of segregation. The maturity of this movie is not meant for younger viewers because they may not understand the symbols shown. Overall, this movie is a depiction of what African American women had to do to overcome equality issues and misogyny.",

Katherine Goble Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson were three african american women who were great at both math and problem solving.They contributed to one of the United States most miraculous events when they helped launch John Glenn into space.\n\tHidden Figures is a movie and book based off a true story. When the story was told in the setting of the 1940's, African-American and women were discriminated against in many aspects of their life. Katherine,Dorothy, and Mary were black women working at NASA in the east wing with multiple other black women. That all changed when Katherine was offered a new job in the East wing with all white males. They looked down upon her at first but soon they realized she and the rest of the women would be a key math component in beating other countries in the race to space.\n\tHidden Figures deserves a ? star rating. The quality of the cinematography is outstanding. The way the movie is set in the time period of discrimination but the quality is clear is amazing. The perspective of the opening scene adds onto the star rating. It shows what talents the women have from the beginning and incorporates a sense of discrimination The reason one point was taken off was because of the way the story was told. Most movies don't show the whole plot as there's no enough time but the movie seemed very untrue to the real story. Women were treated unfairly most of the time at NASA but Katherine Johnson did work as hard to achieve a higher position.\nThis film should be suitable for childern to adults ages 10 and up because the themes can not be fully undestanded if the audience is young. This film would also be enjoyable for people interested in African-American history,NASA's history, or interested in learning about discrimination. Hidden Figures is out of this world extrodinary and is worth the time to watch.",

            "content": "Hidden Figures directed by Theodore Melfi is a thrilling experience about two African American women, who worked for NASA in 1961. These women were named Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, and they were part of one of the most inspiring movies to hit the theaters ever. They each had separate jobs, but have to push through the same problems. Katherine's job was to figure out how to make a spaceship go into orbit, Mary's job was to help engineer a spaceship that could sustain high heats and high altitudes, and Dorothy was the supervisor for her group, which she was then the first ever African American to do so. 1961 was a highly racist time, so the three women had to overcome lots of difficult problems such as having to run a long ways to go to the bathroom, and had to drink from a less purified container of coffee. These females also had to work in a separate room and had to deal with the prejudiced coworkers surrounding them. Hidden Figures gives watchers the thrill of overcoming racism while pulling together an astounding story of trying to figure out how to get a spaceship in orbit, and to land on the moon.    \n\tHidden Figures has many aspects of overcoming racism. One aspect is when Caroline first gets promoted to her job for the duration of the movie. Her co-worker, Paul Stafford, seems to be extremely prejudiced throughout the book. Caroline offers to check his work, and he says \"No it is already correct\", and does not let her check it. Also throughout the movie, Caroline is giving information to Paul, and he quickly tells her that it is wrong or outdated, which she goes back to her workspace, and retires at her work, clearly aggravated. In the next scene, Caroline begs Al Harrison, the leader of the NASA group, to let her in the meeting, and tells him that she has the right information, but Paul refuses to let her in the important meeting.  Al overrides Paul and Caroline is let into the meeting. Later in the meeting, her information is finally seen as correct, and useful, and later in the movie, this information helps NASA reach the moon. Another reason that these women had to overcome racism was that of the unfair gender separated bathrooms and coffee dispensers. This is inadequate because often times throughout the movie, Caroline has to run about half a mile in high heels, just to go use the restroom. Because of this, Caroline's work is often delayed and causes her to be yelled at a few times. This is resolved by Al because he knocked down the \"Colored Women\" restroom sign, and declaring that all women will be allowed to use the white women's restroom. This is seen as shocking by readers because, at the time period, many other companies would have not cared about it. Another scene where racism is taken place is when Caroline is riding the bus, she has to sit in the box. Surrounding her are African American people who are protesting for equal rights. During this scene, Caroline and her children are clearly upset about having to sit in the back of the bus, and they dream of a day where they will be able to sit wherever they want. \nTheodore Melfi directed this movie with almost perfection. The overall message is very moving and is an important message to know today. This movie is great for people of ages 10 and above because the topic is a little harsh for a 9 or below year old, and people who seek the excitement of overcoming racism should watch this movie.",

            "content": "How Stellar!\nMovie Review of Hidden Figures by Ted Melfi\n\nThe movie Hidden Figures represents its name to the fullest, bringing out colors that only select few have. It follows three black women named Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Katherine Goble that are employees of NASA. The story is set during the Space Race - a time where America and Russia battled to become the first on the moon -while women at the time were discriminated against. Despite all odds, Mary Jackson and her cohorts solve NASA's problem, calculating the trajectory of the Apollo 11. The movie has many controversial topics such as discrimination and feminism that are illustrated in much detail, and the theme of willpower is seen everywhere throughout the movie.\nSince Hidden Figures was set during the Space Race, there is still much discrimination against \"colored folk\". At the beginning of the movie, a racist police officer stops Mary, Dorothy, and Katherine and asks for their identification. This is a prime example of what the triplet had to go through, especially Dorothy, over the course of the movie. Also, feminism was still around back then, so when the people at NASA doubt the woman's mathematical ability, it is blatantly obvious that men still feel superior to women in all aspects. The movie reflects both of these points wonderfully, and it creates a situation that makes one sit on the edge of their seat.\nHidden Figures is a movie with tough inner struggle, and the theme of willpower is prominent throughout the film. There were several moments where the women could have given up and sought different paths, but instead, they overcame the hardships set before them. In the end, they accomplished their goals, and are honored because of it. Willpower is a strong force, and the movie proves how powerful it can be.\nThe movie Hidden Figures teaches the audience multiple themes such as discrimination, feminism, and willpower. The story is woven in a way that encompasses all three in a fluent, thrilling cinema. They are brought out the way a river flows; strong yet effortlessly showing the audience the reason behind the movie. This movie should be watched by anyone of any age, for it teaches and educates one with ideas that most do not understand fully.\nRating: 4.9/5.0",

            "content": "The three Women that changed NASA\nThe Movie Review of Hidden Figures by Theodore Melfi \nHidden Figures is a historical fiction movie, based on three young black women. The story takes place in Hampton, Virginia, in the year 1961. In this period America was segregated, and blacks didn't have as many privileges as the whites. This movie is centered around Katherine Coleman; one of the three young black main characters. In the movie, the audience sees Katherine's childhood, and her career in Nasa. In the movie, the director does a fantastic job showing all three of the young ladies triumphs and struggles.  Hidden Figures, although historical fiction, has an inspiring plot, satisfactory actors, and amazing themes.\nThe movie opens up, introducing the main character, Katherine Coleman (Taraji P. Henson) as a child waiting in a hallway naming all the shapes in a stain glass window she is looking at. While Kathrine is doing all this, her parents are talking to an official about moving her to a more advanced school for smart people like her. The official wants to move her to 6th grade even though she is only eight years old. Even though her parents are scared they decide to agree and let her take the classes. The next scene goes 35 years into the future when Katherine is older and stuck on the side of the road. This scene is crucial because it introduces two new characters. This scene introduces Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae). Hidden Figures tells the true story of three young women who were the brains behind one of the biggest operations in all of NASA. The movie then goes on to show the audience the struggles and success of their careers at Nasa as they race against Russia to get the first person to do one orbit around the earth. The actors do a fantastic job showing the characters emotions, and each actor plays the roles very well in each scene. \nWhile the characters in the movie are strong, the actors behind the characters are stronger. Each of the actors was experienced and have been in other major productions. Each of the actors portrayed their roles very well.  All of the actors are well known in today's society and are still very successful in acting. \nAlthough Hidden Figures has many important themes, racism and inequality are the most important themes seen throughout the film. During the movie, Kathrine experiences many racial injustices. For example in the film Kathrine has to run across the NASA campus to use the bathroom, she has to make her own coffee because no one made coffee in the \"black\" coffee machine. She also experiences many inequalities. For example, during this period girls didn't have many  high ranking positions. And because Katherine had such a high rank in this operation for NASA, during the film, the audience sees her going through inequality. Since this movie is based on a true story, not everything that happens in the film is true. For example, all the racial and inequality the character goes through in the movie didn't happen in real life. Maybe the film producer put these inequalities in to show what was going on in the time period of the film. \nThis movie targets everyone in the ages ten and up. This audience is targeted because people have to understand and know the history behind America. People can't watch the movie without knowing the events that happened during the year of this movie. Although not fully accurate the movie did a great job showing how she contributed to NASA and US history.\nHidden Figures is a well-rounded movie overall. With a satisfactory plot, amazing actors, and important themes, this film does an excellent job telling the story of three women that changed history.  This film allows people to see history from a different perspective. The audience also sees NASA at a different perspective. Although targeting anyone above the age of ten and up this book will open many peoples eyes to see history from a different angle.",

            "content": "Figures No Longer Hidden\nA Movie Review of Hidden Figures written by Margot Lee Shetterly\nHidden Figures, a film written by Margot Lee Shetterly and directed by Theodore Melfi, is a detailed representation of the young lives of former NASA workers Katherine Johnson (Taraji Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe). The drama shows the viewers what life was like for the three black women working in a \"man's world\" during racist times. In this film, Katherine Johnson grows up a mathematical genius with a bright mind but a slim chance. Because of racism and sexism, Katherine faces challenges of making a living when she cannot find a job where she can work to her full potential. After her talent is noticed, Johnson and her two friends finally get employed at NASA as a computer. In the beginning, she is discriminated and struggles to prove her skill. The film Hidden Figures thoroughly describes the hardships black women had to go through during the 1930's and how they were recognized as heroes. \n    The film exemplifies all the challenges Jones, Vaughan, and Jackson faced through subtle but significant events. For example, when Katherine needs to use the restroom, the racism is so extreme, she needs to walk across town to use the colored restroom because there were no colored restrooms at NASA. This issue was only brought to attention when Johnson's boss questioned why she was gone for so long every day at work. The women of the film constantly struggled with being underestimated. This is evident when Johnson's co-workers thought she was incapable of understanding most of the calculations in one of the documents used to build the rocket. The person who gave her the document blacked out the majority of the page because it was confidential. Johnson proved herself intelligent enough to comprehend the numbers by looking at the blacked out numbers through the light and correcting them, so that the rocket could be corrected. Because of her actions, she earned herself more respect in the office and deemed herself reliable enough to solve issues. This event is an inspirational lesson on how not to give up when doubted, and to keep working hard through challenges. \nUnfortunately, women were still doubted and underestimated during the 1930's. Because of this, Hidden Figures focused deeply on bringing attention to why these women should not have gone unnoticed. The purpose of the film was to make its audience realize how powerful Johnson and her friends were in ways that their co-workers never imagined. Today, the world still partially struggles with sexism and racism, but this could be changed by bringing other historical female-heroes out of the shadows. The title, Hidden Figures, is a clever way to express what the topic of the film was. Figures, as in geometry, apply to this movie because to make the rocket successful, Johnson needed to find out what went wrong in the calculations. Figures, as in important people, pertained to this film because the three heroic women were under the shadows of people who thought they were better than the rest. Therefore, this film brought out figures that were hidden in two significant ways. Hidden Figures efficiently brought attention to three important women of U.S. history. \nThis movie exceptionally shows true heroes through a sweet and detailed story. The way humor and romance were incorporated only made it more interesting. Hidden Figures might be enjoyable to those seeking an inspirational story of the underdogs of the world. This movie can make the audience smile with its witty humor and sentimental storyline. Someone who desires an action-filled film might not want to watch  Hidden Figures.  This movie receives 4/5 stars.",

Henson (Katherine Goble Johnson) is the strongest of the three and mostly feels like the protagonist. Octavia Spencer (Dorothy Vaughn) is strong and Janelle Monae (Mary Jackson) is the surprise standout. The supporting cast is mostly very good, with Kevin Costner (Al Harrison) the best among them. The script allows for several powerful scenes and monologues that really showcase what these women went through and how strong they were. It's uplifting, empowering, and hits all the beats it needs to so we get the desired feeling when it ends. \n\nWeaknesses: I understand how smart these women were, but I think the film goes a bit far in making the men in the movie seem dumb. Jim Parsons' (Paul Stafford) character is a head engineer, but is made to look like a total idiot. The same goes for the IBM guys. There were ways to ensure that the main women looked smart without having everyone else seem incompetent. Several beats were overused. The moments where the women experience racism are crucial, but it gets done so much that it feels redundant. I also felt that Mahershala Ali (Jim Johnson) was underutilized, while Kirsten Dunst (Vivian Mitchell) wasn't very good.\n\nOverall: There's a lot to like about this emotional journey.

And it can easily be filtered out from all the running sequences it executes since it could have been a bit more intense than it actually pretends to be. The narration is not only adaptive and gripping but contains layered dialogues that strikes well on your mind that highlights the entire sequence through it. If Henson; the protagonist, fails to live up to the potential of the role offered to her and mind that these are big shoes to be filled, she is blessed with an incredible supporting cast that helps elevate the momentum in each frame. \n\nNo matter how stereotypical Costner's character gets, he still delivers thoroughly and on the other hand Spencer too leaves a long lasting impression through her performance. Although, Monae, Dunst and Parsons are surprisingly not convincing enough to blend in aptly into these numbers along with a bit amateur editing and lazy background score. The theme of the tale is genuinely fascinating as the three lead characters resonates their persona with such impactful notions in the storytelling that you cannot not be moved by it. \n\nThey swoop in as their savior with such subtilty that you are practically wolfish rooting for more and more. And with the conflicts like such and the rivalries that anchors and holds them down, these moments glorify them itself. Melfi is undoubtedly a better writer than the director, his nature to weave out a gripping structure is much more powerful than convincingly projecting one. A tale fragile and powerful as Hidden Figures probably required better methodology and treatment in order to draw out more than a nod from the viewers, but the work that went in here is still plausible enough to explore these figures.",

The mathy-parts are stylized so anyone watching who doesn't understand the higher math being used won't be lost. Unfortunately, there's not enough of that math on-screen for those who do understand it, and the little they reference directly is hit-or-miss for accuracy. It will likely appeal more to fans of NASA, anti-racism, and John Glenn than fans of mathematics. The story is well told and the actors have some really good chemistry. It's a really good version of what you would expect to get from the trailers.",

            "content": "Virginia 1961. The United States and USSR are heavily in the Cold War. Internally, there is still many problems between the 2 main races, white and black, that have left major divisions within the country as not all states have embraced the federal government's treaty to end segregation and persecution. One of these states is the home base of NASA. Segregation is abound and white people seem to be very OK with this, despite it making them look like creepy villains whenever they feel the need to take charge of a situation. The movie follows 3 black women, each as brilliant as the other in different ways. A mathematician, an engineer and a self taught computer wizard, these women are employed by NASA in there computing division. They seem to be treated more as a token division then a hard working, noteworthy division filled with intelligent, talented women that can take NASA to that next level. Once Sputnik is launched into space by the Russians and then they send a man into space for a few orbits, the Americans are basically forced to rush into the space wars or else get left behind. Having exhausted themselves, NASA brings in Katherine Johnson to help troubleshoot the math that the white men she worked under had put together. We watch her slowly earn their respect by running circles around them with her brains both in her equations and problem solving abilities but also in how she is able to manipulate office politics to further her pursuit of being taken more seriously. We also watch the other two women take matters into their own hands as they are constantly berated and belittled by white people seemingly just for fun. Watching Mary Jackson manipulate a judge in order to gain admittance to an all white school so she can obtain an engineering degree that would aide in her quest to be deemed an equal amongst her peers and to be able to help build and design future NASA tech. However, in my opinion, the star of the movie is Octavia Spencer playing Dorothy Vaughan. Seeing this oppressed woman fight back by simply taking initiative is heartwarming and also inspiring. Teaching herself how to use the brand new, state of the art IBM calculating machines, she becomes a necessary asset within the NASA ranks despite never being asked to nor being encouraged to do more then she already was with her duties. We watch her simply do what she wants, with the caveat that she is not being selfish but instead working to better NASA as a whole. Her journey is long and arduous but has a very satisfying conclusion. Based on real events, this movie is amazing and a must see for anyone looking to learn more about events that helped shaped our world.",

            "content": "After watching the diversity film Hidden Figures, I felt that the movie could have been so much more.  Sadly the movie continually bashes white males, making them look slow and stupid, while showing the trio of Hidden Figures as genius unrivaled.  Especially disappointing is the demeaning manner in which IBM computer scientists are treated. Too stupid to even find the right-sized room, set up a mainframe, or program it, in one scene, as the IBM males clumsily stammer about, Dorothy Vaughn walks in and at a glance, finds the problem, a loose wire, which she magically plugs in and solves everything!  Vaughn  is also cast as a genius FORTRAN expert who must do her work after hours because the white male neanderthals won't let her work normal hours.  My white male cousin went to MIT and became an IBM computer research scientist, so I take the portrayal of IBM scientists as defamation of character.  Moreover, it was an IBM research team that developed the FORTRAN language.  Who deserves a Congressional Medal - the team that developed FORTRAN or the Hidden Figure who learned how to use it, like millions of others?\n    In its hate fest against white males, the movie portrays NASA engineers as racists who are all much dumber than the Hidden Figures. In reality, however, Mary Jackson was mentored by a brilliant NASA engineer by the name of Czarnecki who published over 300 scientific papers, to about 26 for Jackson; and many of Jackson's papers were written with Czarnecki.  But the movie ignores the fact that Jackson was helped because it's goal was to demean Czarneki and other white males as essentially Nazis.\n   Speaking of Nazis, the movie also overlooks the fact that a real Nazi, Von Braun, was responsible for getting the U.S. to the moon,  This is an important historical fact for our young people to know, but in the world of diversity, who cares about real history?\n    In the movie Katherine Johnson is cast as a mathematical prodigy who, though more brilliant than her male counterparts, is treated like dirt.  Johnson is from a small town in West Virginia, not far from Bluefield where John Forbes Nash was born in the same time period .  Lets's compare these two mathematical geniuses.  Nash, portrayed by Russel Crowe in \"A Beautiful Mind,\" won the Fields Medal in Mathematics, and  many other prestigious awards for his groundbreaking  work.  However, I haven't found anything comparable for Johnson that thousands of mathematicians haven't accomplished.\n    Oddly enough, Dorothy Vaughn went to school less than 100 miles from John Glenn in Ohio.  Glenn's character shows that Ohioans had a totally different view of Blacks than did Virginians in that time period. Glenn would have been horrified to see that in Virginia, that \"five and dime\" stores had drinking fountains labelled \"Colored People.\"  Yes, the south was a different world than the land of Grant and Sherman.\n    It is so sad that a movie like this would have such a small-minded and hateful outlook (so many outright untruths) against white males, rather than celebrating that opportunities and mentoring  offered to African Americans during the early period of the space race.",

            "content": "- The heartfelt genius of Hidden Figures -\n\nJust go and see Hidden Figures right now.  Honestly, stop what you are doing and go.  There couldn't be a better time for the U.S. and the world to receive this gift of perseverance and unity in an era of apathy and individualism.  \n\nAnd to top it off, Hidden Figures is just so much fun!  \n\nThis incredible true story follows three African American women mathematicians working for NASA during the space race.  The film is based on Margot Lee Shetterly's nonfiction book of the same title.  Our three heroes played by Taraji P. Henson (Empire), Octavia Spencer (Fruitvale Station) and Janelle Monáe (Moonlight) support John Glenn in his historic three-time orbit around the earth by calculating his flight path.  They've been hired as \"human computers\" by Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia in an era long before the use of electronic computers.   \n\nIt's 1961 and computing the calculations for NASA's projects is done by hand and is considered secretarial. Secretarial means that this is a job relegated to women.  Despite their bright minds, our African American heroes are segregated from their counterparts due to Jim Crow laws.  These women were first classified by their gender and then segregated by their race.           \n\nI have a complicated relationship with the issues of racial and gender inequality explored in Hidden Figures.  I am mixed.  I'm so mixed I'm multi-racial.  My dad is black and Puerto Rican.  My mom is white.  This makes me what I call a white-passing WOC - woman of color.  I say white-passing because despite my mixed lineage, the world views and treats me as white because of the light color of my skin.  \n\nI don't have to face the daily hurdles that someone with a dark complexion does.  Were I smart enough to work at NASA and it was currently the 1960s, I may have worked with the \"computers\" rather than the \"colored computers\".  Hidden Figures, although set in another era, reflects the contemporary debates surrounding gender and race.  I wonder, how much has changed?  How do I fit into this current social, cultural dynamic?  \n\nKatherine G. Johnson, played by Taraji P. Henson, graduated high school at 14 and college at 18 summa cum laude.  If you are not already dizzy in love with Taraji P. Henson who plays Cookie in Empire, this is your gateway drug. Her performance perfectly captures the mind boggling smarts and determination of real-life Katherine and hit me right in the heart.  \n\nAs the only computer with a deep knowledge of analytical geometry, Katherine receives an assignment to calculate flight trajectories for upcoming missions.  This new project suddenly makes her the only African American woman on the team.\n\nDue to her new and unusual placement, she's now forced to run half a mile to use the \"colored ladies\" room and is given a small designated coffee pot that no one else will touch.  For me, this was rage-inducing.  Combating that negativity, we are invited to whole-heartedly root and cheer for every late night number crunching session and every mathematical triumph, all underscored by Pharrell Williams' nostalgic and superb soundtrack.  The song \"Runnin\" perfectly punctuated Katherine's high heeled shuffling trips to the bathroom.  \n\nThe Hidden Figures soundtrack which also includes Janelle Monáe, Alicia Keys and Mary J. Blige is now my household listening requirement by the way.    \n\nKatherine's two best friends Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) have worship-worthy stories of their own.  Dorothy is lobbying for a title and pay that match the high level of work she is doing while she studies electronic computer programming on the side.  Mary progresses her own journey for advancement via the white-only school system in an attempt to become NASA's first black female engineer.  Hell yes.\n\nThe movie's highlights of strength in the face of adversity were as satisfying and entertaining as the soundtrack.  One particular moment stands out.  Katherine's boss, played by Kevin Costner (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, The Company Men), clearly doubts her mathematical prowess and begins to ask her to use a certain calculation technique.  She interrupts him with more knowledge than he seems to have expected. \"Orthonormalization algorithm? Yes, sir. I prefer it over Euclidean Coordinates.\"  \n\nDespite having no idea what any of that means, it was so fun to laugh while clapping at Katherine's show of knowledge.  The whole theater erupted.  It was an amazing feeling of common unity and celebration.  A feeling that lasted throughout the entire movie.  \n\nVivian Mitchell, played by Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette), works as a supervisor in the white segment of the computers.  While Dorothy does the equivalent job of the black workers, she is given a higher status and paid more.  The tension between Vivian and Katherine highlights the divisive subject of women undermining other women in order to succeed.  The breakdown of oppressed groups that can't, won't or haven't united for equality could fill many libraries.  \n\nBut Hidden Figures is as much about unity as it is about racial and gender divide.  The characters who join together and do not leave others behind were the most successful in this story.  It's a beautiful picture of what we can achieve as people if we look out for more than ourselves.  This is best exemplified in the pivotal moment when Dorothy is finally offered a promotion. She will only accept it if all of her co-workers are able to advance with her.  \n\nDorothy could easily have taken her prize and left all of the others to their own devices but the movie rejects that kind of individualism.  In keeping with the movie's message of strength in community, she has already trained her co-workers in her newly learned computational skills and prepared them for advancement.\n\nHidden Figures' heartfelt message sliced through the complications of inequity and offered a story of empathy and unity. Its bold message declares that working together and caring for others is the only way to glory and success.  This message is heartening to me.  And it's important - now more than ever.  It's important to share ideas of community and compassion through mass mediums like film and Hidden Figures delivers this in delightful spades.  And not only that, it makes math and intellectual pursuit seem like a blast!\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/hidden-figures, and was written by Melissa Balint.

            "content": "An inspiring story not aspiring for originality, Hidden Figures forgoes new math for simple arithmetic, boasting a different kind of edginess just in telling a tale of marginalized trailblazers that needs to be told and seen. This is not to say that such storytelling is easy work, however. For a teaching moment to be this heartwarming, entertaining, and rousing, it takes a very intelligent design and the true beauty of the film comes down to how the whole production explains a complex problem involving segregation and empowerment with such a single, satisfying solution. This PG-rated drama presents the story of a team of female African-American mathematicians (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae) who served a vital role in NASA during the early years of the U.S. space program.  \n\nCertainly, the true events on which Hidden Figures is based didn't unfold so breezily in real life and the actual hidden figures themselves didn't enjoy such a breezy journey. This is a film meant to fuel the soul of all filmgoers, however, especially women and people of color. Its intent is to raise the spirits--not look back in abject anger. This is why their story has been re-purposed as a crowd-pleaser. With a PG rating, it is meant to be accessible. If it encourages action as well, this is only a good thing. But Hidden Figures's main purpose is to inform, honor, and celebrate, which the film does with great dignity and grace. \n\nAdapted from the book by Margot Lee Shetterly, Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi's screenplay provides the perfect template for this successful rendering. The casting only sweetens the pot. Spectacular turns by veterans Henson and Spencer as well as relative newcomer Monae (a breakout role, to be sure) drive the strong narrative. The great supporting performances of Kevin Costner, Jim Parson, and Mahershala Ali likewise deserve mention but this is definitely the ladies' show. As director, Melfi has pulled off a ridiculously impressive feat. Not only does Joan Q. Filmgoer learn about some criminally overlooked figures from American history, but she feels pretty damn good about doing so.\n\nTo Sum It Up: All Plusses, No Minuses",

And boy, that is true for movies too!\nHIDDEN FIGURES\nIn the light of the recent Oscar nominations I've started my yearly goal of watching every single full-feature film fiction before the ceremony. The last two years I've been successful at this task and I figure this time it will be no different. To keep you updated in my task, I'll post reviews in almost every film nominated this year, including films I've seen quite a while ago and that I didn't have time to write a review about. Shifting now my attention to the movie in cause, I have to say that, from the movies nominated, this seems like one of the weaker offers. Despite rating Deadpool just a little higher, I'd be quicker to nominate it for Best Picture first (same with Civil War, Silence, Zootopia, etc.). Despite this, I get why this was nominated as it's almost an obligation to the Academy to nominate films that perpetuate anti-racist messages, especially under the new president. You have to understand that a film's right to be nominated for best picture isn't based solely on the quality of it. With a Best Picture nom often comes a lot of visibility to the film and, consequently, to the matter in question. That's why many studios spend some under the table money to get their features nominated, as they know they'll make back that amount and way more. So, there's a social conscience rescuing this movie from falling flat and from being goldless. In fact, this movie's success pivots around the plot and makes me think why haven't I heard this story sooner. It's an excellent story revolving around a smart script that matches it. The performances are all solid but I was expecting them to be better. Octavia Spencer gives one good performance but a quite manageable too, judging from most of her filmography. I find that she didn't quite deserve her nomination and many performers could have had her spot, though it's amusing to see Viola and Spencer nominated again, the former winning this time around. It also has a strong supporting cast, with Jim Parsons, Kevin Kostner and, especially, Kristen Dunst. However, there's something too neat about the film's directing, editing and cinematography. The director doesn't take many chances, he shoots a scene like any other person would and in this case I don't mind it so much, but it leaves edginess to be desired, that extra excitement that should come from watching a movie for the first time. Ultimately, it's a very good movie that would have been better if it hadn't relied so much on its release date and important plot. It's one of those movies that you should see as a citizen of the world, not much as a cinephile.. .",

            "content": "Hidden Figures is the true story of the women behind the space program in 1961. The three women face issues besides the math behind the launch, they face segregation and sexism. This movie was a successful attempt to inspire women and those of color. Trying to encourage them to break through stereotypes and do what you must even if it is difficult. Besides inspiring, this movie wanted to bring the stories of the quiet heroes to light. The director and writers did just that. They showed the struggles these women faced for their country.\nOne way that \"Hidden Figures\" tried to inspire was by inspiring women and young girls to go for a career in math and science. In the movie not only did the three main women have to face and get through the racism that was still present but they had to face sexism that was still just as much of an issue. It was believed that women aren't as smart as men and that they were meant to just raise a family, clean, and cook. Hidden Figures shows girls that a career in such field as math or science is possible and that they can make a difference. Actor Aldis Hodge said \"I love the fact that a lot of these girls are now getting support for their interest.\", though his role in the movie that quite small he still gets to witness the difference this film is making. The screenwriters even snuck a little hint towards inspiring women in these careers into the dialogue. The character Karl Zielinski says \"a person with an engineer's mind should be an engineer.\" this was towards a black female character, Mary Jackson, who was struggling following her dreams.\nIf it wasn't for this movie then the stories of these women probably would be unknown to all. If some people did know of them before the movie that's amazing but it just isn't enough. These women did extraordinary work and made huge breakthroughs in history. Honestly if it wasn't for their hard work and calculations the space launch could have failed or even been delayed. The directors found it important to show what they did to the world using the big screen and by adding slight humor to it. Obviously the movie isn't exactly accurate but it still accomplishing showing the work of these women. Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughan are all now recognizable names.\nAlthough this movie added humor and made it a nice family film, the subtle racism and sexism behind are made apparent to adults or older people. When irritated the character Mary Jackson says \"Every time we get a chance to get ahead they move the finish line.\" this really shows how much harder they had to work just to do what a white man could have done in half the time it takes the black women. It shows just how strong and brave they are because they still tried and never let anybody stop them. Knowing the struggles they had to go through while just doing their job and trying to help their country makes it even more amazing.\n    This movie is just as important as it is entertaining. The writers accomplished a lot by making it funny and cute while still addressing the problems they faced. Everybody who worked on this movie hopes that it will, inspire, bring the hidden stories to light, and show the struggles these girls had to face. It's important to know these things so we can have an appreciation for the hidden heroes. Which sometimes are the most important ones. Some would say it's the perfect movie, entertaining for all ages, has an important message, and funny.",

And do some research to check some details - love the Internet.\n\nYes, I know the film is not a documentary, I know that there is such a thing as dramatic licence and artistic licence and so forth, but - Holy Fuck - this was not, as advertised, a \"dramatic biopic\"; it was fairytale. The impact was doubled by the hideous dumbing-down of everything. Everything was a caricature. There are no real, 3-D people in this film. There are only goodies and baddies. The goodies are always right, and the baddies are always wrong. In fact, some of the goodies have magical powers and do things that are ridiculous and impossible - sort of the cerebral equivalent of action heroes in a Chuck Norris film, I suppose. There are 2 speaking part baddies who get redemption at the end of the film by seeing the error of their ways and finally behaving nicely. Ta-dah! Redemption level achieved. Lesson learned. Example set. Didn't see that coming, did you?\n\nThe central theme is that both black people (\"coloreds\") and women were treated unequally at the time in the US, and the film lays this on with a trowel. And then a shovel. And then a series of dump trucks. OK, the film-maker is entitled to emphasis his point, and these things were true in many aspects of everyday life, and this would be a fair enough take, except for one important thing. The average viewer would come away thinking that racial segregation was endemic at NASA, which is actually the opposite of the truth. NASA was a federally-mandated equal opportunity employer (one of the first), and in fact, set up by Johnson that way to provide opportunities for education, employment and advancement for blacks. Yes, there was one \"Colored Women's Bathroom\" (left over from the old NACA days), but it wasn't 1/2 a mile away, and the sign wasn't dramatically knocked down with a tyre iron in front of a breathless audience by the head of NASA (or Kevin Costner). As usual, the truth was more prosaic. Its existence was mostly ignored, and the sign was eventually removed with a memo. Apparently this tyre iron scene in the film had US audiences cheering. Cheering. Did they think it was real? Or even remotely likely? \n The logic wouldn't fool a 12 year old.\n\nWhile this film provides, apparently, many uplifting moments, I found it so contrived and false and wrong (unintentionally in many places) that I was alternating between outraged gasps and laughing out loud. I know that this is a common experience for those of us with an interest in history, but there is one difference here: many of the the people who worked there at the time are still around, and they must love that they're all being painted as misogynistic racists.\nMost people don't read books or even articles. The film is what they will think was the truth. That's sad.\nI could list all the distortions, exaggerations, and stupid scientific/factual errors in this film, but that will have to wait until I have a few hours spare.",

Prior to the installation of their first IBM mainframe (depicted in the film), NASA used human \"computers\" to check and double-check calculations; the film follows a group of three of these African American women from the \"coloured computer\" group.  Taraji P. Henson plays Katherine G. Johnson who assisted with advanced calculations for John Glenn's first orbit around the Earth (and subsequently the Apollo 11 mission and flights in the space shuttle era).  Henson's experiences in the all-white NASA offices and engineering labs shown here are, as expected, sometime unpleasant (as when she is snubbed by white colleagues) but sometimes positive (as when she is supported by white colleagues, such as boss Al Harrison, played by Kevin Costner).  Janelle Monáe plays Mary Jackson who successfully became NASA's first African American female engineer (after challenging Virginia's segregated school's policy).  Octavia Spencer plays Dorothy Vaughan who became NASA's first African American female supervisor, running the IBM computer lab.  Although their stories are true, they remained largely unheralded until this film (which Johnson was alive to see at age 98) - so it is worth trumpeting their stereotype-breaking successes.  The movie itself sticks to the feel-good playbook, providing a bit of backstory to each of the characters, a little romance for Johnson, showing their lives outside of work, a few ugly incidents (racism), and, of course, some tension before everything falls into place as a result of the hard work of these women. And it's all set to some rousing music (coordinated by Pharrell Williams).  In the end, NASA benefits, the US moves ahead of the Soviets in the space race, and best of all, these women also experience gratifying personal success.  However, this is the Hollywood version of their story, so don't expect anything edgy or challenging.",

            "content": "\"Hidden Figures\" is an extremely empowering movie for women, and is a ver well-thought out and well delivered film. All three of the lead actresses were great, Taraji P. Henson (Katherine Johnson), Octavia Spencer (Dorothy Vaughan), and Janelle Monae (Mary Jackson) all held their own, and each contributed a lot to this movie. Each of their characters were deep enough, all three of them could've each had their own movie, but I really enjoyed the way they linked all three of these stories together. The movie deals a lot with the U.S Space Program in the 60's and the \"Space Race\" with the Russians, and the tension within NASA during that time is definitely well translated into this movie, from the clothing, to the scenery, even down to the accents, it was all perfect. There were some times in this movie where they tried to introduce some side stories into the main plot, which didn't really contribute much to the big picture of the movie, so I feel as though some of those parts could've either gotten more time, or just been scrapped completely in order to make the important parts even better. All in all though, \"Hidden Figures\" is a great movie about empowerment in the 60's, and is definitely worth watching.",

Today we talk about discrimination against women, though this film is an example that it all had started way long ago, yet the struggle has not ended. Anyway, this is a biopic, a biopic of three women and their struggle not just being a black, but being women. When the nation was eager to send its first man to the space, there was some trouble within the team who are behind it to work together as one. Lots of inspiring events reveal how the history was made and the working culture was changed forever inside the NASA.\n\nThe film was nominated for the Oscars in the three slots, but did not win any. That's fine, because I would prefer those real women to be recognised over what this film had achieved. All the three actresses were good. Their roles were unique from one another. Really a wonder film about three real persons in one film. Something rare in films to highlight their achievements equally. The personal life, as well as their professional was well briefed.\n\nThe others like Kevin and Dunst in small part were also good. Directed by just a one film old filmmaker. He did good. The screenplay was adapted from the book of the same name. Deserved all the awards and praises it had received. After seeing how it had ended, a sequel could be possible. Mission Moon.

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) We re introduced to three African American women stranded on the road in 1960 s Virginia. They are  computers  - women who perform computations for NASA s space program. Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson) performs computations for the Mercury program. Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon e) works as an engineer in the wind tunnels for the Mercury. And Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) acts as a supervisor for the other computing women, all of whom are Black. Goble has been reassigned to work on the trajectories for the upcoming manned-flights of the Mercury program. She is dismissed by the other mathematicians because she is a woman, and a Black woman at that. Among her many challenges is the fact that the restrooms in the facility are segregated. And the only  colored  rest room for women is across the campus. She frequently has to run a half mile to use the ladies  room - taking her work with her.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Meanwhile, Mary diagnoses a problem in the experimental space capsules heat shields, inspiring her to pursue an engineering degree. She convinces a judge to grant her permission to attend night classes at an all-white school. Dorothy learns that a huge new IBM computer will replace her co-workers. She sneaks into the computer room and successfully operates the machine. At the library she is scolded for visiting the whites-only section on computer programming. She teaches herself Fortran and is promoted to supervise the programming department, arranging for her women co-workers to be transferred there.\n\nGREG: There aren t many movies featuring women in technology, let alone women of color. Most of our images of engineers and scientists are of young men (see The Social Network). What is marvelous about this film is that it features three such women. They not only have to face gender stereotypes, but also battle racial divides. The common trope in films dealing with race is that there is a white benefactor who lifts the African American up to where they belong. We see this in such films as The Blind Side, 42, and Race. But in Hidden Figures we re witness to women who deal with their stereotyped roles head on and fend for themselves. It s a refreshing change. I was moved to tears watching Mary stand before a judge and plead her case to be allowed into an all-white community college. I know people who have had to fight for what they have earned. But they deal with a level playing field. Mary has the deck stacked against her. She not only has to change the mind of the white judge who blocks her way into school, but that of her militant husband who believes that violence is the only answer. Hidden Figures delivers three powerful examples of women overcoming prejudice on their own terms.\n\nSCOTT: You re absolutely right, Greg. Hidden Figures shows the shattering of two barriers, gender and race, in the early 1960s. I had never heard this true story of these three remarkable women, and I m ashamed of either myself, or the system in which I was raised that suppressed this story, or both. These three heroes won my heart and earned my deepest respect. Like Jackie Robinson in 42, they knew that breaking barriers required them to take the high road when encountering inevitable prejudice and pushback. Their lives and careers were complex, difficult, way-paving and inspiring to say the least. There may not have been any overt White helpers per se, but one cannot overlook the open-mindedness of people who assisted or supported these women s efforts. Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) deserves kudos in his supervisory role, helping Katherine Goble adjust to her new position and even taking a sledgehammer to the  whites only  restroom sign. The judge who bends an existing exclusionary rule also helps Mary get the education she seeks. There almost have to be people in the majority race who step up to do the right thing in the service of our heroes. Having said that, I agree that this film more than most others we ve seen emphasizes the independent nature of our heroes  quest to break their barriers.\n\nGREG: We see some good mentoring and leadership in Dorothy s character. She recognizes that the world is changing and that computing machines are the next big thing. So she learns the FORTRAN computing language and teaches it to her staff. So, when the machine finally work, and the management is looking for programmers, Dorothy is ready with 30 women trained to go. I liked Hidden Figures very much. I often look for the  seams  in a movie where the structure shows through. But I was so engrossed in the story that the seams fell away. We have three different and connected hero s journeys - and each got ample screen time. The movie is inspirational to women and people of color, but it also shines a bright light on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Women and minorities are often left behind in the STEM world, and I think Hidden Figures will inspire a new generation of engineers. I give Hidden Figures 5 out of 5 Reels. Scott, we often look for transformation in our heroes, but sometimes the heroes transform others instead. Katherine showed that she could do a job as well as any white man. In so doing she changed the culture of NASA to be more inclusive. Dorothy broke barriers by becoming the first black woman to be a supervisor at NASA. And Mary changed the educational system to allow blacks into their community college. In each case the transformation was on society as a whole, rather than in the heroes. I give these three women 5 out of 5 Heroes. It s hard to find good mentors, and Hidden FIgures is no different. Each of these women had to forge onward using their own skills and intelligence. But they did it essentially alone. When you re the first to arrive in the  special world  there often isn t someone there to act as a mentor. We did witness some good mentoring in Dorothy and her team of  computers.  So I can only muster 2 Mentor points. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: All your praise directed at Hidden Figures is right on the mark, Greg. These brave, remarkable women did what society s best heroes do, namely, set out on a journey that will bring them pain and resistance from others, defying social conventions that need defying. This movie deserves strong consideration for Best Picture in 2016. I also give it 5 Reels out of 5. As with other way-pavers and barrier-breakers, these Hidden Figures are both transformed and transforming. We talk about heroes being both the source and the target of transformation in our latest book, Reel Heroes & Villains. These women grow in their courage and resilience, and they have no doubt (and will no doubt) inspire generations of historically oppressed individuals to reach for the stars, both literally and figuratively. I give our heroes 5 Hero points out of 5. There is mentoring going on in this movie but as we ve pointed out, this film emphasizes the fierce independence of these women. Yes, they got help of course, but their success derived mostly from their own innate talent and indomitable spirit. I ll award 3 mentor points out of 5 for the subtle ways that our Hidden Figures received little nudges of help behind the scenes. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

Unbeknown to them, the expertise they require is working locked in a basement of Nasa specifically sealed off from the rest of the staff due to their race.  Once recognised these women still struggle to do their jobs efficiently due to the barriers they face which again are only there because of their race.  Despite this they continue to fight to do their jobs because there are higher things at stake than their own happiness.  All 3 actresses give stand out performances and the film kept me hooked throughout and that can be quite a difficult task when maths is involved.

It's a nice story and a strong moral, if a bit on the safe side. Nothing seems terribly difficult for these women, whether it's theoretical physics or racial equality, which reduces the power of their eventual success. One early scene epitomizes this attitude: broken down on the side of the road, they're approached by a stereotypical southern white policeman. Though internally panicked, they proudly stand their ground and deflect his barbs, and moments later he's giving them a friendly escort to the workplace. Faced with any degree of adversity, they merely hunker down, redouble their efforts and glide to victory. Which is admirable, and possibly truthful, if not especially gripping. The acting is good - Taraji P. Henson is most memorable as a mousey mother of three whose sole public outburst provides the film's only major dash of flavor - but the plot is too interested in lobbing softballs when it could've been pitching something with teeth. A warm, simple tale, appropriate viewing for a Sunday night with the family if not for challenging conventions.",

It focuses on the small things, the day-today logistics of trying to live equally in an unequal world, and is all the more powerful for it.  The characters are fighting systemic racism rather than overt racism, and that battle is even more daunting a fight.  It'll piss you off, for sure.  The acting is outstanding across the board, the story is very well-written, but the directing for me was just ho-hum.  Yeah, it's an amazing story, and one that it is high time was told, but it could have been told with more pizzazz and originality.  If it weren't for its incredible subject, the film itself is pretty standard movie fare.  The writing is the best thing about it - it's well paced and includes a good deal of humor, which is always welcome with such serious subject matter.  Best of all, it is not emotionally manipulative like I expected it to be.  However, even though there is no mustache-twirling evil racist villain, it does fall back on the \"good white people\" and \"bad white people\" characterizations, and even the \"good\" white people are totally-self serving.  I'm sure not everybody in the 60s fell so neatly into one of those two categories.  Regardless, it's shocking to realize that this stuff happened only 50-off years ago.

If I am honest, I feel ashamed to say I was not aware of the four women at the heart this film, which I suppose reflects the sentiment of the film's title. But this is why Hidden Figures was so successful with both audiences and critics. It opened my eyes and entertained me while doing it. \n\nWhile all of the performances stand out in their own right, Taraji P. Henson was especially notable. The way she embodies a set of mannerisms foreign to her natural tendencies is a testament to the way she throws herself into her character. It is almost understated but incredibly effectual. She helps ground the scope of the story, which could have gotten lost in the grand picture of space and the promise of the new frontier, in the human element, which in actuality is where the most compelling parts of the story flow out of. As impressive as it is to consider the groundbreaking efforts that led to the first orbits of the earth (and these moments are intense), it is the subtlety of scenes such as having to run across Nasa headquarters just to use a \"colours only\" bathroom sign, or the intimate family portraits that show a husband and wife, children and parents trying to find their way in a segregated landscape that sticks with me in the end.",

Also, it almost feels like the screenwriters might have taken some creative license here. What are the odds that three best friends who carpool together to work all become ground-breaking figures in their respective disciplines? It's like figuring the odds that three children growing up on the same block all grow up to be senators. It's highly unlikely. Two of the women get their big breaks on the same morning. I wanted the writers to put more realism into the script. I am sure they were all great at their jobs, but I felt like I was missing information about the connection between the three women. Precisely how much intersection was there truly between their lives? When did they meet each other? Were they all innately ambitious, or did they influence each other to become ambitious? Or did they simply work in the same location without necessarily being that close? Did they get hired around the same time? I remember some voiceover description about the beginning of their careers, but it wasn't enough to stick with me. How did the carpooling arrangement start? I needed something extra there that was just missing from the story. I feel like, if one of them were to write a memoir, the true story wouldn't be quite as coincidental.",

Set in the 1960s, the movie shows the struggles of black people (majorly women in particular) in the US - even at NASA. Despite having all the necessary educational qualifications and traits, black women keep getting relegated or not allowed to progress.\nThey are racially discriminated in all aspects of like - even having different restrooms, different coffee pots, different libraries, different transport systems, different educational systems to name a few - based on their color. There was a scene where the lead actress (Taraji P. Henson) literally runs in the rain wearing a skirt and heels & carrying some folders of documents and a white man comes across her with an umbrella and he just moves away (showing a hatred to even help). Gut wrenching to imagine how people lived those days in extreme discrimination.\nAwesome performance by Octavia Spencer as well - carries her head throughout the movie. The lead actresses gracefully move throughout the movie with bold & amazing performances.\nThe movie shows the struggles of these women just to even retain their respective jobs and excel at it compared to their white peers (despite having very salaries compared to their white peers). Shows the hidden achievements of these women at NASA and how they helped NASA become a front runner in space programs.",

For instance while the running to a \"Colored\" bathroom in another building happened, it happened to one of the other three women, and not Johnson...whereas Johnson apparently just used the white restroom for years, when it was eventually questioned, she said deal with it, and it was dropped.  I like the real story so much better than the boss with a heart of gold who changes the rules for her.  She made the change because she didn't take crap. That's better!  But really, the movie brings their story to light, even if years and details are all wrong (as biopics tend to do), as a movie, it is a bit too Hollywood but it is solid...and how often does a major release like this feature three black female leads?  Pretty much never.  Movie is feelgood entertainment, and it praises hard work, science, intelligence, and working towards your goals no matter the obstacles (whether they be getting a man into space, or just advancing your career while not looking like everyone else)...good message, mostly well told, and a solid picture.",

            "content": "The Math Adds Up in Hidden Figures\n\nDirector Ted Melfi expertly tells a feel-good, heroic, story about a group of African-American women that lived through a time-period of persecution and discrimination in the movie Hidden Figures.  The cast does a brilliant job of portraying the three main characters and are lead by a strong, humorous, performance from Janelle Monáe, who plays the character Mary.  Janelle Monáe, of singer/songwriter fame, lands her first lead role in a film, and does not disappoint. Aside from Monáe, the supporting actors portrayed their character's and relationships perfectly.\n\nThe story itself follows three African-American women as they overcome prejudice and discrimination to help NASA create the mathematical calculations to send a rocket into space. One particular scene of the film that was very triumphant was when Kevin Costner, Al Harrison in the film, explains how Katherine leaving everyday for such a long period is taking away from her work. What he is unaware of is that she was having to run a half an hour to the colored bathroom because there wasn't a bathroom \"for her\" in this building. After realizing how outrageous this was, Al Harrison is seen taking a baseball bat to the colored bathroom sign and exclaims \"Here at NASA, we all pee the same color!\" Katherine's drive and remarkable intelligence made her stand out which in turn showed how ridiculous she was being treated on a daily basis. Al Harrison as a person in power was changed because of how valuable Katherine was. This particular scene was iconic and a turning point in the film. Katherine went from being a \"computer\" to someone who was leading the way for the rest of the program. Despite many failed attempts, the women overcome their struggles and celebrate in succeeding their goal. Hidden Figures uses simple charm and a great story to be a crowd-pleaser for all.  \n\nUnlike many Hollywood movies, Hidden Figures did not need expensive sets or special-effects, as the story is enough to capture the audience's attention for two hours all on its own.  The story lacks originality, using the same underdog rising to triumph story of many films, but the film makes up for it with it's characters' charms and a well-told true story.",

Johnson and her colleagues were vital to the success of NASA's first space mission, but, as African American women, their achievements have not been untold until now.\n\nHidden Figures takes this criminally overlooked chapter in black history and writes it large following this trio of incredible likeable female scientists, who were the brains behind launching the first American astronaut, John Glenn, into space. This inspiring tale of three black women who defied prejudice is carried by stunning performances from its three leading ladies Taraji P Henson, Janelle Monaé and Octavia Spencer.\n\nIt's rare that a biopic about an American triumph doesn't centre on the achievements of white men, but this engaging and entertaining feel good movie, where the visionary thinking of space travel contrasts with the backwards mentality of racial segregation, is a sure fire crowd pleaser. It's an amazing story that deserved to be told.",

As Melfi proved in his previous film, St Vincent, he's good with actors and is a competent storyteller, but he can't resist underlining things that are already obvious. At a time when calls for diverse media dominate the industry, Hidden Figures hedges its bets with a family-friendly commercial solution: warm and fuzzy storytelling that's both progressive and safe. For all of its current touchstones, Hidden Figures feels far too late, both in the recognition these women deserve and the filmmakers' goodhearted but dull approach to their stories. Hidden Figures is an earnest movie, but not a very exciting one. The screenplay feels as engineered as a Gemini rocket launch, with every scene and line carefully calculated. The film aims for the stars but might have gone stratospheric if it cooled its jets ever so slightly. Hidden Figures is engaging, entertaining and enlightening -- but by playing fast and loose with historical fact, it risks blunting some of the story's eye-opening emotional force.\n\nVERDICT: \"In The Zone\" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)",

To me, they can get as close to perfection as possible. A well-made biopic has the power to shake us to our very core.\n\nHidden Figures proves this beyond the shadow of a doubt. The story of three African-American women, fighting racism, who, against all odds believe in themselves and make their country proud.\n\nWhile telling their story, the film also tackles the issues of gender inequality and racism. Inequality between men and women in general and apartheid between the whites and colored. It seemed like being a black woman in 19th Century America was the worst life you could possibly have.\n\nThis disparity was clearly seen in general public as well as within their space organization NASA. The film also understands that it wants to tell the story of these three women and not the story of racism in America at period of time. So, it never gets too preachy or deviates itself from the subject matter. Hitting all the right notes along the way.\n\nTaraji P. Henson (as Katherine Johnson), Janelle Monáe (as Mary Jackson) and Octavia Spencer (as Dorothy Vaughn) were outstanding. A special mention to Mahershala Alia (Colonel Jim Johnson) and my boy Jim Parsons (Paul Stafford) for their side roles. And Kevin Costner (Al Harrison) who gets some of the best lines.\n\nThe directing, editing, visuals, cinematography & set pieces were on-point.\n\nAs for issues, I think they should have dumbed it down a bit. It gets far too technical and mathematical, diving into analytical geometry and whatnot. Also the film doesn't have much re-watching value to it. I don't see myself watching it alone all by myself again. There are no action scenes or plot twists. Just a simple story told in a passionate way.\n\nMaybe I'm nitpicking here. Gather round with your family and watch this if you can. It is well worth your time. You won't be disappointed.\n\n5/5 Stars.",

Taraji P.

Writer-director Theodore Melfi tells the story in broad strokes with no real surprises and the racial dynamic is presented with minimal tension, but it isn't overly inspirational or sentimental. What makes the movie so pleasurable is watching these smart, sassy, confident women use their intelligence to overcome racial prejudice and sexism during the Civil Rights era. Written by Melfi and Allison Schroeder, based on the book by Margot Lee Shetterly. With Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali.",
