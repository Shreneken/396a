Despite his doctor's diagnosis, British authorities deny Blake's benefits and tell him to return to his job.

Sprinkle in a handful of out-of-touch anachronisms to establish the character, give him a heart of gold through his connections to his neighbors and friends, and collect your accolades for a supposedly biting criticism targeting an uncaring social safety net. The messaging is easy to agree with, the simplistic execution is not. \n\nKen Loach and Paul Laverty took the 'Rehabilitated?' scene from The Shawshank Redemption, recreated it in an English benefits office, and then decided to work the story back from there.

Instead, Ken Loach prefers to tell the story of Daniel Blake, a sick man, who struggles to survive and still manages to help others along the way. It is a good film to understand the British social security, and why not say it, around the world. This type of production needs to be more and more common because it denounces the ills of the current world.",

Each stage and process that is seen in the film, gives truth to the burden that must live not only the old generations, but also the new ones.\nThe person who plays Blake is Dave Johns, who for his good performance helped win the Palme d'Or at Cannes for the film. A well-deserved award from my perspective, because this independent film shows a reality that a major film producer would not do, and that Sixteen Films and Why Not Productions did. Such a reality is the duality of the capitalist problem that represents on the one hand the skills or experience in young people and the knowledge of new technologies in older people.\nIn my opinion it is a good production, as it shows the reality of many people in the UK, people who don't drink tea with rolls, but yes with worries.",

Ken Loach clearly massively cares about telling these people stories and the performances are astonishing from the less experienced cast. The one criticism I have with it is that Loach seems to really have to hammer home his point and it can get to the level which feels a little preachy but this is a minor concern about a brilliant, haunting and fantastically made film.",

A lot of the film is clearly populated by non-actors and a lot of the script seems improvised.

            "content": "British director Ken Loach isn't known for politically subtle films; his stories are ones which grounded in one political worldview, promoting and expounding it from a variety of angels. That's not to say he's necessarily heavy-handed; but he runs that risk on occasions. Approaching this film, aware that it was his state of the (British) nation address from the point of view of people lost in a labyrinthine benefits system, I was expecting something I would be naturally sympathetic to but possibly alienated from due to what I expected to be broad-brush strokes. I was wrong; it's Loach's most nuanced and delicate film, telling a simple story with slowly simmering rage. A widowed man is signed off sick from work due to a heart condition; as he attempts to claim the benefits he needs he befriends a single mother and her children as they too seek the support the state should be giving them. Though the script is compelling, the real strength of the film is in its silences and counterpoints; the personal care of the food bank volunteers against the largely dispassionate, impersonal government employees. This results in the films most moving scene - a visit to a food bank where a combination of hunger and receiving compassion tip a desperate, nearly crushed woman in to an act of quiet desperation that's heartbreaking to watch. It's to the film's immense credit that it doesn't drift into anti-climax afterwards; yet neither is there a cheap, easy victory or moment of false hope. Hope is there, but it walks a vulnerable line of being extinguished by the system designed to serve the very people lost under the weight rules and regulations. It's a story of the people who fall through the cracks; it reminded me of Dickens' urgent, prophetic tales of urban poverty and never ending legal wranglings - and the film does not suffer from such lofty comparison. We're left asking: do we contribute to such systems' oppression and suffering, or do we seek out those who are lost, sit with them, listen to them, walk with them? It's a film of difficult questions and few answers; but that is moving, satisfying, funny and eloquent for all that.",

I was touched by the kindness of the people working there and angry about Katie's situation, being alone starving. It was a very heartfelt and sincere movie dealing with social issues and injustices. The performance of the actors were unbelievably accurate mainly because they actors were not professionals. Ken Loach offers another overwhelming film.

Even if the actors play quite well, in fact it's so realistic that we almost feel like we are among them, we put ourselves in their shoes. I think it's too bad that the film could may not be attractive enough to give to younger people the desire to watch it. To sum up the sadness of the movie helps us to realize how difficult life can be for some people, maybe our neighbors, so it's a movie I advice people to watch. Congratulations to Ken Loach, once again.",

The system that makes sure he get's some welfare money is making him sign a lot of papers, applying for several systems and making him take courses. He will probably come back to his work rather soon but the system makes it hard for him as some vital calls and letters never reach him. He is in the middle, shifted everywhere as he are treated in ways that seem unnecessarily complicated. No one helps him, they just give him plenty of stress. There's a good thing he is a smart, nice fella with his priorities right. He helps out a young mother of two, Katie, in his sparetime. Trying to get her on her feet. She is in the same system and really trouble with money.\n\nFantastic pace and build up here, and super acting by the two leads, mixing the parallel stories with big success. The protagonist is a tremendous character in this film that takes a solid punch at the system. There's also a superb climax in this light but also hardhitting film when needed.\n\n8 out of 10 cans of paint.",

            "content": "As anyone who has ever contended with governmental bureaucracy (which is to say everyone) can attest, it sucks.  But never more so than for the people least equipped to deal with it.  In this film, director Ken Loach shows us one man's (Kafka-esque) struggle in a straightforward realist way - the facts speak for themselves, no comedy allowed (despite the fact that star Dave Johns is a British comedian).  Loach's films have always championed the working class and the down-and-out and that hasn't changed here - but at age 79, he has found a way to reduce the polemics and just show the pain (and the human dignity it impinges upon).  Daniel Blake, a carpenter, has had a heart attack and his doctors forbid him from working - so he goes on what we would call \"disability\" payments here in Australia (the UK system seems similar).  But for some reason, his case is re-evaluated and he is found \"fit for work\" by a telephone assessor, a judgment which he tries to appeal by necessity, given his doctors' verdict.  While waiting for appeal, in order to keep any payments at all, he is encouraged to apply for the \"jobseeker's allowance\", which comes with an array of strings attached - 35 hours per week spent seeking work, a condescending CV workshop, and other indignities.  Blake dutifully complies (but not without some sarcastic retorts, not quite sotto voce) despite the fact that he can't really take any job he finds.  A subplot involves a young single mother (Hayley Squires), befriended by Blake, who is relocated to Newcastle (where the film takes place) for public housing but isn't given any welfare because she was late for an appointment (due to getting on the wrong bus).  Her experience seems even more calamitous and desperate than Blake's.  Loach does resort to some pretty dramatic examples to show us how the system fails ordinary people -- and how those who work within it can become hard-hearted in order to manage programs that are under-resourced, \"digital by default\", and ideological targets for right-wing politicians to cut.  A quick Google search for \"Centrelink problems\" here in Australia results immediately in the following quote from our national news desk: \"The Government knew Centrelink's debt recovery program would incorrectly tell clients they owed money if human oversight was reduced, but continued to do so in a bid to cut costs.\" Equally terrifying.  Films such as this can win sympathy (the film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes) but will the politicians listen?  Every vote counts.",

I gave 4.5 only because it is not recognised as a documentary of what is wrong with the system and that is a very important point, otherwise the acting and the daily occurrences in intimate life and interaction with services is spot on 10/10.

As winner of last year's Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, it's safe to assume that that will not be the end of this film's accolades. Director Ken Loach has an almost unmarred history of producing quality films over the last 50 years, but this emotive and honest look at poverty in the first world rivals his 1969 masterpiece \"Kes\". The film concerns the titular Daniel Blake, a widower out of work due to health issues, as he struggles against a system that slowly kills the poor through starvation, exposure, and endless bureaucracy. He befriends a single mother of two, and they try to help each other stay afloat in a society of indifference. Along the way they have chance encounters with glimmers of human kindness that help them get by for the time being. It's not too dissimilar from last year's \"A Man Called Ove\" in terms of characters and plot, but the two films diverge in focus. \"...Ove\" is more concerned with the heart and how we can distance ourselves from others due to trauma whereas \"...Blake\" is an indictment of the state for its apathetic role in the degradation of the working class. Dave Johns does an excellent job of capturing Blake as a man who refuses to give up in spite of being trapped in an endless loop of paperwork and meetings. He embodies the frustration that the working class has simmered in for the last decade since, between the housing crisis and the banking collapse, it became abundantly clear that the haves will make no caveats for the have-nots.",

This film began with a very simple pretext and characters, but ended up with a \"bang\" that brought out the stark difference between the endless hopelessness that the protagonists have to suffer throughout the film, and their heartbreaking tenacity in keeping every last pieces of their dignity, and humanity. Someone looking for a sophisticated cinematic work that was able to win the \"Palme d'Or\" over much more prominent films like \"The Salesman\" or \"Toni Erdmann\" would probably be disappointed with this film's simplicity and its repeated theme from other Ken Loach's works. But no matter how complex we are, human is actually simple at heart (literally and metaphorically), especially when facing hardships in life.

Many film experts thought it would sail through, but that did not happen. Now I saw it and I think it should have made into. If the priests' dirty secrets were recognised to condemn on such a big platform, then this film deserves as well. Because it reveals the cruelty against the economically weaker families and computer illiterate old men.\n\nIt is only this much short to be called a documentary film. I mean it was very realistic with cinematic dialogues, otherwise a documentary. This is a message film, highlights what's wrong with our system and who are all suffering from it. The actors were great and the 80 years- old director had done a magnificent job. You could watch as many films you want, but if you fail to watch a film like this often, there no meaning getting into film watching business.\n\nThe story follows a 60 year old widower whose name mentioned in the title. As he is recovering from heart attack and as advise given by his doctor, now he's out of the job and support allowance. Whenever he approaches the officials to look his issue, they always come up with different reasons to send him back disappointing. Especially not being into the computers, he struggles to fill forms on the internet platform.\n\nHe's very patience and following everything they have told him to do. One day he comes to aid to a single mother with two kids who recently moved to the city from London, when she is too struggling in the employment agency to get a job. So their relationship grows as they lend hands to one another in tough times. Following, how they recover from the issues they are facing is what the film to cover in the remaining parts.\n\n\"Listen, you know, you give me a plot of land, I can build you a house. But I've never been anywhere near a computer.\"\n\nI liked this the film, but I think it was too realistic for my kind of taste. Because I like emotional parts and in this film those parts were highly effective, but not sentimentally striking way. Maybe you can say, less music with more dramatisation changed the storytelling style. Though the focus given on economically lower class and their way of life, not intentionally, but lack of support in society, all these were well detailed. I have always supported films that point outs flaws in basic establishment in society.\n\nAlmost all the major struggling juncture one goes through in the employment agency, particularly if the person was old is uncovered. Like the telephone calls responding to the recorded message, online applications, as well as meeting them in person. What we're facing right now in the world is or to know is, not everybody is a computer literate. It'll be in the future, but not now. They are not getting proper help, particularly agency treating them like the illegal immigrants.\n\nIn addition the film gets more interesting when a single mother was introduced. On the other side, different issues faced by poverty ridden small family, particularly her desperate attempt to fulfill the basic needs of her children is heartbreaking. This is not just the English problem, but everywhere else in the world. It had won several awards, particularly one BAFTA award. A good film for everyone, only if you understand the notion of the film or else will be a boring film.\n\nWhile I was watching it, I thought it was a regular kind drama, so I kept expecting that things would turn this and that way. For almost the entire film, but it's only in the final stage something it came up with to surprise me. So my advice is keep low expectation and be patience. More importantly accept what it reveals than what you want from it. If you fail on that, then its not your film and to know that the only way is to watch it.\n\n7 1/2/10",

His doctor says that he absolutely cannot return to work as his heart's condition is far too serious. However, the British government has deemed him \"fit for work\" which means he cannot collect the British equivalent to America's Disability Insurance. Now that the government has deemed him fit for work, he must collect Job Seekers Allowance, where he must look for work at least 35 hours a week (even though he cannot work). The film gives two different points of view, one from Daniel Blake and one from Katie (Hayley Squires), a single mother of two who has recently moved out to Newcastle. Her situation is very simple, she has two kids and because she was late for her appointment due to her being lost (once again, she recently moved out to Newcastle) she has been sanctioned. This means that her Job Seekers Allowance has been frozen for 4 weeks (which she can only appeal retroactively). Daniel befriends Katie in the building where she is attempting to collect her Allowance. Daniel attempts to help the family (not financially as he has not income) but through general acts of kindness, like fixing the fuse box in their house or making things for the kids. Most people may not know what people who are forced to live on the social safety net struggle with on a daily basis and the film does an excellent job at explaining to people. As far as cinematography goes, it is spot on. There is one specific scene in a food bank that because of the great writing, acting, and camera work is one of the most stunning scenes in any film of the past decade. It is truly? heartbreaking. Acting is spot on by Dave Johns and Hayley Squires, Squires in particular truly captures the desperation on behalf of a single mother of two who must go to great lengths to put food on the table. Overall, this film is breathtaking in its telling of the stories of so many people. There are hundreds of thousands of Daniel Blake out there and hopefully, ?this exemplary film will allow them to be heard. This film should be mandatory viewing for any politician and frankly to anyone. See it!",

I challenge all so called \"professional\" critics to prove that they remotely have been through what Daniel Blake went through, No you don't know, so shut up as it's real. I on the other hand went through the same assesment by ATOS for mental health PTSD. I scored no points and was told to go back to work. I had my reassessment and scored no points again. I was desperate and put a rope around my neck. I went through with it only to be cut down in time. I had my tribunal in a court with a judge who only listened to 5 mins of what my daily life is like. He stopped the hearing and awarded me benefit for life without review. I want to work. 7 years on I have developed coping mechanisms, sometimes they fall apart. Today I volunteer to work with and help the homeless and lonely. What the film actually shows it is what I found. I didn't know what to say to a homeless person I knew little of the empathy and how to show it even though through my tough times I had been homeless to. \n\nSo what is wrong with the those critics who blast the film or even give it the thumbs up as they want to be seen as the good guys as they know the system is wrong but they don't know how. \n\nWhat the film shows is in reality as I found how to empathise with people in dire straights and the homeless and the Lost...IT IS SIMPLE LISTEN...... ALOT, then and only then will you work out who's playing the system and who's not. Then you are responsible as a human being to help those people in such dire SITUATIONS. AND BEFORE you say it's there own fault. Yes it is, they made some wrong choices. One day, you might the wrong choice, your family and home in ruins.

            "content": "After Looking For Eric, The Angels' Share and Jimmy's Hall I think it's fair to say that Ken Loach, in his twilight years, wasn't quite as hard-hitting as the reputation that preceded him. In fact, two films inbetween these  - Route Irish and It's a Free World - where largely ignored all together. You'd have to go back to 2006 and his politically charged, Irish revolutionary drama The Wind that Shakes the Barley, to find quintessential Loach. Now though, he returns with another political drama in I, Daniel Blake and it's one of his most potent and important films. \n\nPlot: After a heart attack leaves him unable to work, widowed carpenter Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) is forced to apply for state welfare. However, the system is designed to make it difficult for him to receive any support at all. Throughout his ordeal, he befriends Katie (Hayley Squires), a single mother who finds herself in a similar situation, while trying to raise and feed her children. Together, they try to rise above the indignity of the governments extreme 'austerity' measures. \n\nIn 2014 (directly after Jimmy's Hall) Loach decided to announce his retirement from filmmaking. It was crushing news from one of the most passionate political voices in British cinema. Not to say that there isn't other talents who tackle similar projects and important social issues in film (Shane Meadows and Mike Leigh spring to mind) but there really isn't anyone quite like Ken Loach. In keeping with his socialist views - before he said farewell - he allowed all of his filmography to be available for free via YouTube. However, his retirement lasted just over a year before he stated his intent to come back and make a film on the British welfare system and the Tory government's barbaric treatment of the most vulnerable people in society. \n\nLoach obviously felt that this was a story that needed to be told. And it is. In fact, this film has been so effective that it was even raised and commented on in the Houses of Parliament, itself. Naturally, the Tory MP's lambasted it for being unfair (oh, the irony!) or for failing to accurately depict the \"decency\" of those that work with the Department of Work and Pensions - the very foot soldiers of the Govt who have been imposing such harsh penalties and sanctions on the average working class or disabled person. Methinks the Tories protest too much and, in actual fact, Loach has hit a very raw nerve. Those that work in the DWP may claim that they're only doing their job but really they're just whores of the state that are facilitating nothing less than a fascist regime. \n\n\"Work Will Set You Free\" a slogan that was once used by the Nazi's above the gates of Auschwitz. This is the very ideology of Tory Britain in our current times: Don't have a job? - Tough shit! Poverty on the rise? - Fuck That! Using foodbanks to eat? - Fuck You!... I think you get the gist. Put simply, the lower classes, the sick and the disabled are seen as parasites to a dulled-down, media-controlled society that perpetuates and excuses a fascist government. A government full of toffs that wouldn't know how to walk without a silver spoon up their arse and are blatantly happy giving tax breaks to corporations and their greedy wee cronies. \n\nSocial justice has always been a recurring theme throughout Loach's films and here his voice on the matter is ferociously loud and clear. I, Daniel Blake is a scathing indictment on the government and their complete lack of empathy towards its own citizens. \n\nAs is often the case, his films capture a raw authenticity. There's a stark reality to this that almost feels like a documentary. He has a real ability to focus on everyday people living in everyday situations. Even if you left aside the political commentary, you'd still find that Loach has crafted a genuinely touching human drama. Ultimately, this is a story about dignity, self-respect and injustice. \n\nThe film is anchored by two excellent central performances; normally known for stand-up comedy, Dave Johns as the titular character delivers solid work in his film debut but it's Hayley Squires as the single mother of two who finds herself in some devastating circumstances that truly captures your heart. For all it's unapologetic candidness, however, it also has a surprising amount of humour. To manage this, with such a bleak subject matter, only reaffirms Loach's ability to capture every aspect of life. Despite the hardships and the barbarism that people face on the lower echelons of society, there's is still a humanity that shines through. \n\nLoach has always championed the browbeaten, lower classes and his work in I, Daniel Blake (at the age of 80) shows that the fire in his soul hasn't wained a bit. Like Daniel Blake himself, he's a true voice for inequality and the dispossessed. For an understanding of how cruel our government and society has fast become, this is essential viewing. \n\nMark Walker",

The films biggest weakness is how one-dimensionally the authoritive staff are portrayed, with the exception of the one obligatory Angel figure of course. All of them are curt, borderline rude and appear to completely ignore what our protagonist, and others in a similar situation, have to say. It does ring very true at times, but much of the movie feels more like a finger poke than a commentary. But the lead characters' plea is very real, and he's very easy to sympathise with. He never overplays, facing each obstacle with resolve and a distinctly British sense of humour. The pacing is a little slack, and the climax feels like a real Hollywood product, but the film overall is heartfelt and socially relevant, and many of its scenes are just watching Blake reacting to his seemingly deepening misery, but always with a quirk and deep determination to keep soldiering on. I'd almost call it essential viewing for its topic alone, but it has so much more than that to offer.",

In the wake of a near fatal heart attack Blake is ordered to indefinitely cease working to prevent further injury and advised to sign on for social welfare years of graft as a skilled carpenter there is understandably a sense of reluctance, however the necessity of money eventually makes his trip to the dole office an unavoidable one. \n\nThe script was penned by Paul Laverty, having previously worked with Loach on his first Palme d'Or winning film 'The Wind That Shakes the Barley' depicting the Irish War of Independence. Laverty possesses a remarkable ability to find humour in otherwise distressing situations. A catch-22 situation presents itself as Daniel Blake learns he is ineligible for social welfare and, against quantitative evidence from medical professionals, deemed fit to work. Appeal against the decision and receive no benefits at all, or spend his days looking for work he cannot take in order to receive Jobseeker's Allowance. After spending decades paying into a supposed safety net system it's farcical to discover that he does not qualify for benefits. The ludicrous nature of the circumstances is only exacerbated by the emotionless government officials who seem more interested in saving money than granting it to those entitled. \n\nThe issue of humanity, or lack thereof, is prominent throughout the film. This is illustrated by the distinct contrast between the almost robotic job centre employees, and Blake's fellow victims of this red tape merry-go-round. His life becomes entangled with one such victim, Katie (Hayley Squires), after she is relocated almost 300 miles to Newcastle due to an alleged lack of social housing in her previous home, London. Their encounter is an unforgettable one as Katie learns she will be denied her benefits as a result of arriving late to the appointment. She is then further punished after explaining she accidentally took the wrong bus in an alien city by being heartlessly removed by security, and Blake, pointing out the lunacy of unfolding events, meets the same fate. The silver lining to this otherwise disheartening scene is the almost father-daughter relationship that forms.\n\nAs the pair continue to jump through their respective administrative hoops they find solace in the company of one another. Blake, in using his carpentry skills to improve the condition of Katie's new home and Katie in helping Blake navigate a 'digital by default' paperless system. Additionally, her two children receive support from a long awaited father figure as their mother plunges deeper into distress over monetary troubles without the support network of her friends and family. The crescendo of emotions reaches breaking point as she is forced to turn to a food bank in order to survive. A heart wrenching scene of pure desperation follows as the starving Katie cowers in the corner of the room devouring a tin of cold baked beans. 'Look at the state of me' she says to Blake, this is what she has been driven to.\n\nI, Daniel Blake takes many dramatic twists and turns before its inevitable climax. Loach, not one for subtlety, puts the audience through an array of emotion in what could be described as an expos\u00e9 into a broken system supposed to offer aid, not frustration and suffering. Driven out of assumed retirement to create perhaps his magnum opus, this insightful representation of real struggles is one not to be missed.",

I, Daniel Blake examines social issues with the British job market, all while being led by really naturalistic acting and storytelling. While the script from Paul Laverty (Loach's frequent collaborator) doesn't offer too many surprises, it's never wincing, and feels of the moment than ever in light of the uncertain economic future the world is facing. At 80-years old, Ken Loach still feels remarkably contemporary a filmmaker, albeit one with very visible experience.",

It stars Dave Johns as Daniel Blake, who is denied employment and support allowance despite his doctor finding him unfit to work. Hayley Squires co-stars as Katie, a struggling single mother whom Daniel befriends. \n\nLet's hit the negatives before I start gushing about this movie.  There is absolutely no concept of time.  It's tough to know if a week, a month or even a year goes by from start to finish and that is a wee bit problematic.  Also, the ending is utterly predictable.  I saw it from a mile away.  Sometimes a filmmaker ties up all the loose ends unnecessarily.  Somewhere i have to imagine there was an alternate ending.\n\nLoach's attentional to detail is a thing to marvel.  He meticulously carves out a touch of life that is as authentic as it is a reminder that often we aren't doing enough for those less fortunate.  Even if you caught this in the United States, it rings true.  Unless you're filthy rich and/or have the means or the time to battle a government agency, we've all been given the runaround.  You feel the frustration of our main character Daniel Blake (Johns).  All he wants to do is work.  This work is an inspiration and will provoke various emotions. Final Score: 8.1/10",

Some of the plotting might seem a bit neat but it feels no less real and never stray too close into melodramatic contrivances. And as always, his film always makes the best of new or lesser known actors. Dave Johns and Hayley Squires are naturalistic and totally believable in their respective roles, and the latter gives a particularly heart-breaking performance. Tender and lighter moments keep the audience engaged when tackling a serious subject matter, even for those who might not agree with the film's point of view and in fact, makes you re-think about the issues at hand and therein lays its ultimate power.",

It serves up a realistic endearing story of the platonic friendship of Daniel Blake and Katie, a single Londoner mother of two children from two different fathers. The chance meeting of the two in an unemployment centre focuses on how difficult and flawed the social security benefits system is along with the callous patronising  jobsworths that work in them. People do laugh even when times are hard and from the very start of this film you'll be in stitches. The story of the human condition resonates clearly and it's hard not to love alongside strong performances from the entire cast. The film won the Palme D'or award at this years Cannes and rightly so.

Oh Kes!\" But Kes was 47 years ago and shamefully, I'm not familiar with any of his films since then. One conclusion from this realisation is that Loach has a strong reputation as a filmmaker and this was my long awaited reunion. \n\nWe follow Daniel Blake, a middle-aged carpenter who's taken a few recent knocks, one of which is suffering a heart-attack and deemed not able to return to work. It's a position no one would want to be in, forced to sacrifice your own health or lose everything you have worked so hard for. \n\nWe witness the hurdles that seem purposely put there to hinder payments, speaking from personal experience I can relate to this situation to a degree. How are people such as Daniel Blake suppose to survive, or better still, have a good life they are suppose to be able to live. \n\nIt's a harsh reality on how parts of the British system fails it's people and proof that there's no real incentive to do things by the book. Having been in a similar situation myself, skirting the unemployment line getting advise from people who have no ambitious or understanding of what I wanted to do. \n\nTaking this on a more personal level, I quit a stressful position last year in the hopes of pursuing my own dream of being an artist and writer. Having to sign agreement that I would spend a number of hours trying to find work and having to provide evidence of doing so each fortnight would grant me the universal credit that I never actually received. I actually had a good case worker, as everyplace of work has good people, but equally there are those that can't see beyond, much like what is portrayed in this story. Though, instead of supporting me in trying to be something I both enjoy and apparently good at, they attempted to find me similar stressful jobs that I left for my own sanity, wanting to place me back amongst the wolves. \n\nDave Johns is exceptional as Daniel Blake, emitting the boiling frustrations of the soul-destroying turn of events, right to the very end. Hayley Squires' Katie is short of brilliant too, displaying the tremendous pressure when faced with these kind of tribulations. Though, the acting from the rest of the supporting cast is less desirable, it's forgivable. \n\nIt's a raw, honest and emotional look at the suffering and poor way of life some unfortunate people have to contend with in Great Britain. It's compelling, invoking and upsetting, showing the great lengths and risks people go through in order to maintain their self dignity. It's certainly a film that boasts Loach's credibility. \n\nRunning Time: 8\nThe Cast: 7\nPerformance: 7\nDirection: 7\nStory: 8\nScript: 8\nCreativity: 8\nSoundtrack: 6\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the difficult subject matter and perfect portrayal. \nWould I buy the Bluray?: yes \n\n79% 8/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

Some great performances by its 2 unknown stars, but the story is sometimes predictable/worst case scenario in order to deliver the blows that a Ken Loach film requires. Still well worth a watch though.",
