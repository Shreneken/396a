So pathetic.  Males these days have become extremely weak, thanks to the new feminist upbringing.  Mothers and society grooms boys to be weak and submissive to girls.  This is greatly hampering the things men achieve in life, and greatly affects their livelihood by having much lower confidence and self-esteem, and taking enough initiative.  Society will crumble without men.  Stop simping and grab your life by the horns.",

There are many more but those were the main issues I had with the movie. The only redeeming quality is that there is a couple cool action scenes. However, if one only has a couple action scenes to compliment in a superhero movie, that is how you can tell the movie is bad. 20/100",

The dialogue is awful, with unnecessary attempts at humor. The CGI is poor, with Steppenwolf looking like a rough first draft of a final villain. The acting is mediocre, mostly from Gal Gadot (\"Kal-El, no!).\n\nTake all those elements and a disjointed storyline, and you get the disaster that is \"Justice League\". There were multiple times where I had to rewind the movie to see if I missed something, because the editing was so choppy.\n\nWith poor relationship building and an incoherent plot, \"Justice League\" is an incredible disappointment. In the end, this movie is just a bunch of indestructible people hitting each other until the credits finally roll.\n\nBest Character: Barry Allen (I hate to say that)\nBest Scene: Superman's eye moving while the Flash is running by.\nBest Quote: \"Oh, wow. They just... They really just vanished, huh? Oh, that's rude.\" - Barry Allen\nBest Piece of Score: \"Home\"\n\nAdditional Note: When Bruce talks about the table for 6 (plus more), I got excited, and I don't know why. It was probably excitement for whatever James Gunn is going to do to revive the franchise.",

Joss Whedon was not the right choice for this movie either. \n\nI could complain about a million individual things in this movie. The exposition dumps, the complete tonal differences between scenes, the obvious reshoots, the cringy dialogue, and much more. But what pains me with this movie is that it takes some of the coolest superheroes of all time and makes them LAME. This is one of the few movies that ACTUALLY has the \"he's right behind me, isn't he?\" type dialogue that people complain about with marvel movies. \n\nThis movie is boring. This movie is too short. This movie's villain is boring. These should not be issues in superhero movies. I haven't watched the Synder Cut yet, but I will soon.

This one felt so rushed with very little character development, dialogue that seemed like it was written by and for children, mostly bad acting, mediocre CGI (good CGI in some parts), humor that worked only half the time but the rest of the time was atrocious, no DeSaad or Darkseid and no real motivation for the villain, and scenes that were not needed and could've been replaced by much better ones that we saw later! It's been a while since I've been this let down by a superhero movie that was supposed to be a big grand experience but it undeniably wasn't! So much charm, excitement, and exhilaration was missing!

            "content": "There's a lot of controversy between the Justice League VS Zack Snyder's Justice League, and I'm here to settle the debate once and for all. Justice League is the far superior movie. I am a major cinephile. I have seen all of the good ones. I rarely have seen the bad ones. Let me tell you, Zack Snyder's Justice League is a bad one, and the Justice League is a good one. Why you ask? Easy, mostly because of the way they are and not because of the way they aren't. Let's get to the one thing everyone wants to talk about: The Joker, the clown prince of crime himself. I am particularly fond of the Joker, and he doesn't appear in either film. You're probably thinking, \"Peter S, I saw him in the trailer for Zack Snyder's Justice League when he made the society meme.\" First, I hate memes. Second, that wasn't even in the movie. Well now you're probably thinking, \"Woah, that's crazy, then he wasn't in the Justice League either, right? RIGHT?\" Actually, he was. Not many people noticed, but he is in the background of 8 scenes in this movie. He actually has more on screen time then General Zod if you can believe it. You're probably thinking, \"What?\" and I would say, \"Yep, it's true. He's there.\" Is this what makes the Justice League better than Zach Snyder's Justice League? Yes and no. It's only 1 part of the larger picture. Not many people know this but Warner Brothers made a real life ARG to coincide with the release of the Justice League. Not a single person figured it out, and Warner Brothers never admitted to doing it. In fact, when I questioned them about it, they said, \"We didn't do that.\" Likely story. If you pause the movie at 58 minutes (there about, I don't want to give it away completely) then you will see the second part of the riddle. The first part was posted on twitter 58 days before the film released on the official Warner Bros twitter. What do we get if we solve it? I don't know. My facebook group the gaped crusaders has some ideas. How does this make Justice League better than Zack Snyder's Justice League? I'm glad you asked. Warner Brothers is saying, \"Hey, you have to become Batman to figure it out.\" Me? As Batman? No way. I was essentially a member of the crew. I was in the Justice League. Zack Snyder may have started the film, but it was Warner Bros executives who decided to cast me as the Batman, Bruce Wayne, Bats, the Dark Knight, the Caped Crusader. I haven't felt this involved since I won a contest to do a stunt for Michael Chiklis in the Fantastic Four movie. I didn't get to meet any of the cast members and Chiklis wasn't on set that day and they didn't use the scene in the movie, but just being part of something bigger than myself made me feel strong.",

What is Steppenwolf's motivation? None he just wants to wipe out the land and take the mother boxes for no reason, after that what is he going to do? Steppenwolf is just another bad and salty villain that is only in the movie to exist without any worthy development. Where is Dark Seid in this movie? Steppenwolf talked about him once in the movie and they didn't show us ANYTHING? the movie just says that, imagine an ordinary person who doesn't know who Dark Seid is watching this movie. Joss Whedon, explain to me what this is, the way they revived Superman is comical, it seems that the League only exists WITH SUPERMAN and only works with Superman, comics have already been shown the opposite and instead of giving development to Lobo da Steppe or the League, you guys spend time with a random Russian family man, it must be like 20 minutes of just the Russian family that could add the Flash back in time scene or other better scenes. Directors have to understand one thing: DC IS NOT MARVEL, Marvel does serious jokes and DC DOESN'T! DC is what it is nowadays because of the serious stories it has and you do scenes like the Flash falling on top of Wonder Woman or that \"I have no legs\" joke",

Contrary to the constant critic bashing, which to be perfectly honest has gotten out of control and extremely annoying fast for a while now, critics get a good deal of respect from me. Even when my opinions differ to theirs, which has happened a fair number of times, their appraisals and criticisms are very understandable and it is easy to see where they are coming from. 'Justice League' is a case of the film being much better than anticipated, considering the word of mouth and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' being so disappointing. Is 'Justice League' better than that film? Yes, by quite a bit.\n\n'Justice League' does have its problems. Although the CGI is pretty good on the whole, there is an over-reliance of it and it doesn't always add to some of the scenes. The story has its fun and excitingly compelling moments, but a lot of it does feel rushed, which does see too many abrupt tonal and storytelling shifts, and some of the first half has a cobbled together and rambling quality. Am usually not one to carp about plot holes, much of the time it is a lazy criticism to me, but one can fit the Grand Canyon through some of them and some border on the ridiculous.\n\nThe rushed pacing does come at the expense of character development, which tends to be rather flimsy. Particularly true to this is the villain, there is nothing menacing or remotely interesting about him, he's basically a very dull just there sort of character. Ciaran Hinds is completely wasted, while Ray Fisher is somewhat dull. Not all the jokes work, some feel out of place, while the final battle could have had more excitement and Danny Elfman's music score is uninspired and forgettable.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the acting is very good. Ben Affleck brings a brooding intensity to Batman and he didn't seem that bored to me. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane, Jason Momoa's beautifully judged Aquaman and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman. Ezra Miller is amusing, if at times slightly too introverted, as Flash and Henry Cavill looks much more comfortable here than he did in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Diane Lane and JK Simmons are also welcome presences.\n\nVisually, 'Justice League' is beautifully shot, far more cohesively edited and its boldly dark and gritty look fits very well within the story. The script is less clunky and dreary and lightened by some nice quirky humour and some jokes are amusing, especially the absolute hoot that involves the magic lasso. The action is mostly nicely choreographed and fun to watch, some of the characters are interesting and the chemistry is great.\n\nIn summary, could have been much better but to me it wasn't that bad. 5.5-6/10 Bethany Cox",

This is just a terribly written story and script - given trying to continue BvS didn't leave much to work with, but as Ripley said, \"I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.\"\n\nFrom the start - Ben Affleck as Batman is just a poor choice.  Given he's an improvement on the Kilmer and Clooney, and the script didn't help much either, I just can't recall a movie where I saw his range validating him as a choice here.  Now knowing that WB cast Pattison shows that they cannot make good choices for DC movies.  While Pattison is a better actor than Affleck, he doesn't look the part and carries an immediate stigmatism that DC can't afford after watching Justice League.  \n\nJason Momoa is not a bad choice for Aquaman and was fine for what the role allowed him, he can play more than just a big surfer.  Yet we we have a script that makes him sound like a drunken frat boy instead of the future king of Atlantis.  \n\nCyborg was just boring, I think I dozed off during the Synder cut with his extended screen time.  Ray Fischer was another poor choice to play the role - Cyborg was really made memorable in TT (not TT:Go), and \"BOOYAH\" has been said multiple times in the comics prior.  So Whedon and Fischer were probably not a proper pair to work together - but it again goes back to the original script being soo bad.\n\nEzra Miller is a bright spot in the movie - especially the Synder cut.  He is able to bring the serious and goofy Barry Allen to life.  Maybe a Flashpoint will erase all this and let us start anew with Miller's Flash being the focal point, and the more comical Wally West making an appearance!  \n\nSpecial effects were typical, but half the movie is shot in a box format that doesn't match up with todays viewing preferences.  Let's change something else to an already over crowded, poorly scripted movie!  \n\nWith the theatrical release, we have Joss Whedon trying to reshoot parts from an entirely different bad script, and then force them into an originally script that was already poor and convoluted.  The Schneider cut was only marginally better because at least it's just one bad script with some better continuity, but it's still just boring and dull.  \n\nI luckily saw the original release while flying and felt better about not paying.  After recently watching the Synder cut, I can say that I've seen it once, and don't need to see it again.  Better luck next time WB....",

            "content": "The production drama behind Justice League is actually more well known than the movie itself. Wrought with a series of problems on and off the set, Justice League is a mess of a film. Director Zak Snyder had an original cut of the film, which at over 3 hours, was deemed by the studio \u2018unwatchable'. He was dismissed before the film was completed; however, originally it was announced he has stepped down due to his daughter's death.  Warner Bros. brought in writer/director Joss Whedon to lighten the tone of the film, by shooting new scenes, changing the score, the colour grading and special effects, however the original cinematographer of Justice League has claimed only 10% of the original film remains in the theatrical cut. \n\nDue to the massive reshoots, the film's budget grew to $300 million USD, and became one of the most expensive films ever made. Unfortunately, due to the poor reviews and audience reception, the film made less than $700 million USD worldwide, which did not cover the costs of production and promotion, thus a sequel was scrapped. Since the film's release, fans have been hounding Warner Bros. to release Zak Snyder's original cut, even raising money to help with production costs, though the studio has stated they have no interest.\n\nBut getting back to the film, the final product is mostly a waste of money, sure the gathering of the team is interesting and the plot, though not great, is very much of the comics, however the visual effects are laughable at times, there are too many brooding \u2018bro-ish' male leads on the team, and the only real upside could have been an even better sequel, which as I mentioned is now quashed.",

            "content": "Well, considering that Joss Whedon made extensive changes to this movie after Zack Snyder left the project, I'm pretty unimpressed by what we got in Justice League. This first big group movie for the DCEU brings together 6 superheroes, similarly to The Avengers, to help face a world ending threat. On the surface, with Joss Whedon working on it, that all seems like a great idea considering how good the first Avengers movie was. Unfortunately, when you look at the fine print, this film doesn't live up to any of those expectations and is a huge letdown in a lot of ways. The acting is decent but the movie doesn't make great use of it's A-list actors, which it has a fair amount of. The story is nothing new and the script is pretty lackluster and doesn't really give any characters moments to shine or do something memorable. The scenes aren't quite as bad as they were in Suicide Squad, but they only rise above them by a little bit and don't really earn redemption from the two terrible movies of 2016, Suicide Squad and Dawn of Justice. The dialogue is weird and awkward at times which makes the movie's attempts at humor feel iffy and come short and even a lot of the serious scenes don't work too well either. This movie doesn't flow smoothly in the way that The Avengers did, making it feel like a drag and be unenjoyable at times. The heroes themselves are a big problem. They are thinly written and given little backstory, so we don't learn too much about them, which is an issue because we've seen very little of some of them before the movie. Only half of the heroes had substantial appearances before the movie and they needed a lot more context and screentime to work and be effective in the movie. They feel underexplored both before and during the movie, which sucks because many of these characters are iconic and well known in the DC universe. So, we have missed opportunities there. The final fight of the movie makes Steppenwolf, the villain, feel really underwhelming and doesn't make him seem powerful enough to be a worthy adversary to the Justice League, which lowers the stakes of the movie a bit. The end of the movie is predictable and cliche and doesn't leave any surprises or twists waiting for us. My best description for this movie that it's a poor man's version of The Avengers and I wouldn't recommend watching this movie to anyone who expects the big group film quality that we've seen in the MCU.",

He looks like someone just made something out of a cartoon and just says the word mother, throughout the movie. I seriously wanted to punch someone if Steppenwolf said the word mother again. This movie is basically just a pointless, heartless, corporate sellout. There's literally has no care about anything that it's doing.

It's a mess that is very fractured in dialogue and plot. I also found it so distracting to play inserted scene v original scene due to the inconsistencies and continuity errors. For example Batman ( Ben Affleck ) in certain scenes has facial stubble and in others he is clean shaven and these scenes jump about throughout the film. Coupled with Superman's ( Henry Cavill ) top lip debacle that was poorly edited in post, ( due to his moustache being edited out of the reshot scenes ) makes it almost impossible to be immersed in whatever story is going on.\n\nThe special effects seem straight out of the early 1990's and both the main villain and his army of flying aliens look as though they have been lifted from a video game.\n\nI am aware of the back story regarding the Zak Snyder cut and the disappointment  when this version was the cinematic release. Why the film lost 2 hours and went through so many re shots and extreme colourisation is simply due to Warner Brothers panic after test audiences reactions. Clearly they wanted a more Marvel style film and took the opportunity of Zak Snyder's early exit to rework his vision and release a more watered down version.

The problem lies that too much of Snyder's vision remains, this does not mesh well with Whedon's style and there are some awkward scenes as a result.  Whedon's execution is reminiscent of his work in the \"Avengers\" film, the problem is what worked there failed to work here.  In \"Justice League\", all these characters are just tossed to us without much exposition.  The reason this worked in \"Avengers\" is that all of their main characters were introduced in prior films, there was no need to revisit that.  \"Justice League\" tried doing the same but we are given many new characters with little to no explanation as to who they are or what their purpose is, they just serve as an uninspired plot device to get the story moving.  In regard to the cast, I do not believe I can criticize any of them because they are the victim of studio interference who's performance suffer as a result.  At the end of the day, \"Justice League\" feels like a generic but action-packed blockbuster.  It remains entertaining but there is no reason to revisit this film afterward.",

The action is far better to match the tone of the current DC Universe WB was trying to establish and the story as a whole would definitely have done better for the franchise to set up individual movies for each new character as we were it made you more invested in them and you actual saw there growth in the movie.\n\nYes the film isn't perfect, but still a damn good watch as the skips between parts of the story are a bit quick in terms of story progression.

Then why is Flash even a thing, this film will never explain.\n3. Cyborg is good enough to be in Justice League, but Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter don't even exist. Why, this film will never explain.\n4. Steppenwolf's army is so weak, even the warriors of Amazon and Atlantic people can beat the hell out of them. Then how are they even a threat, this film will never explain.\n5. Superman blows out of his coffin because of which his shirt and coat get burnt away, but his pants are still on, showing him shirtless. Will the same thing happen with Wonder Woman also, this film will never explain.\nAnd most importantly,\n6. HOW ON EARTH (literally) IS AQUAMAN FIGHTING OUTSIDE WATER, AND THAT TOO WITH SUCH PERFECTION!?!?!\nThe only good scene in this whole film was when Superman was fighting with Flash in slow motion (or rather Flash was just trying to run away from Superman) for 30 seconds. But you can just watch that scene on YouTube. And it will seem even more entertaining without any context.\nBut later on I learnt about how Warner Bros had brought in Joss Whedon to finish the movie while Zack Snyder had left for his daughter's death and that completely butchered the movie. And after having watched the Snyder Cut I realised this movie was even worse than what I remembered. Although I don't hate Joss Whedon the way all these toxic Snyder stans do, he did a pretty terrible work here. He literally had just one job - consult Snyder and ask what has to be done, and then add CGI to the rough cut.\nI think I will rewatch this movie one more time sometime in the future, when I have nothing better to do. Then I may even reconsider adding some more points in this review that I may have forgotten to write now.",

The mustache gate is worth all the memes.\nThe only thing of the Whedon Cut that are really cool and would have added something to the original Snyder's vision are the first\nBatman sequence and the head titles.\nAll Darkseid references were cut except one, while they should have been the main cliffhangers for the next chapter.\nThe Russian family subplot was completely unnecessary and took away screentime that would have been a nice chance to improve the development of the characters named above.\nThe colour filter applied on the whole movie is awful.\nSometimes there's more irony than requested (flash motorboating Diana breasts, \"something's definitely bleeding\" and so on), Flash was turned into a clown.\nIn conclusion, the movie isn't good but isn't absolute trash, but if compared with ZSJL, it is.",

I liked the fact that we had character development for Cyborg and more on flash as well. It's definitely time for a Cyborg and Flash solo movies. Hopefully with the same actors portraying the characters. \n\nLet's make movies kids and parents can appreciate together!",

But now having seen a version from its real director, it is genuinely shocking how many things, both large and small were changed by the uncredited stand in director Joss Whedon. And none of them for the better. Rewatching this version after the Snyder version, this feels like the lame quip filled, extra interpersonal conflict, overly comedic attempt at the same movie that it really is... which is doubly strange since this is the original theatrical film. I won't say cut, because this film is more than just a shorter theatrical version, at least half this Whedon movie wasn't in the real director's final movie, and much that was felt completely different through different framing, tone, music, dialogue, lighting, coloration, cgi,  etc... and again all of it worse in this version. So as I said, in a vacuum when it came out, this was a meh 2 1/2 star movie. But now it lives in a world where the real movie was released, and this store brand version was revealed for the lame attempt at the same story it really was...",

I'm not trying to compare this with the avengers, but at least in the avengers they made it seem like everyone is useful in their own way. But in this movie, they make it seem like Superman carries the team and he can do it all on his own and that's true but when you have heroes like Batman, Wonder Woman, flash, aquaman, and Flash everyone should be helpful and useful for the team.

The CGI is embarrassingly bad for 2017 especially with the final battle, the jokes are so forced, unfunny and feel out of place and the plot is as generic and as thin as you can get with no layers. Steppenwolf is also one of the worst comic book villains ever. There's nothing interesting about him and let's talk about the characters. Batman is not Batman here; I refuse to believe this is the same Batman from BvS. Aquaman and Cyborg do nothing here, Flash just serves as unfunny comic relief. Wonder Woman is ok, same with Superman but it's inconsistent from the Superman from the other films. The tone is all over the place as well. The dialogue is terrible and the story feels so rushed. It's like there's a longer cut of the movie but it was cut down in the editing room. Oh, wait, that's what exactly happened! Overall, this is an embarrassing piece of failure. The only good things are the action scenes, acting and character interactions but even those are just above average. One of the worst superhero movies and an insult to Zack Snyder, DC and fans of DC and movies in general  (D-)",

But also, I felt that that version contradicted my first movie in many ways, and this current movie, which I was already in production on. So then, what are you going to do? I was like\u2026you would have to play ball in both directions in order for that to work.

It seems to me, and this is just an opinion, that the studio is to blame for trying to hard to catch the MCU and for not focusing on a singular vision, which would have delivered something more memorable to the fans. As you would suspect with such revered characters, it's full of really cool moments but ultimately misses the mark and doesn't deliver on the potential that the source material hands you on a silver platter.

Superman to the fluffy and restrained Justice League is one of my biggest gripes with this film. The Batman character in particular feels like such a \"180\" from what we saw in Batman v. Superman. Furthermore, I felt that Steppenwolf was a pretty \"run of the mill\" cliche villain that I didn't find convincing enough. Perhaps more time spent building up his character and focusing on his motives would have improved that. Unfortunately, there is a lack of chemistry between the hero characters, likely as a result of the extremely rushed first act. Rather than setting up character relationships with substantial and meaningful dialogue, this film chooses to gloss over all of that and go straight to the CGI-filled action. As a result, the characters still didn't feel like they really knew each other even by the end of the film. Considering Man of Steel was about two and a half hours long and the Ultimate Edition of Batman v. Superman was over three, this film, where we see these iconic DC heroes teaming up for the first time in live action, should have been longer and more patient. Instead, they chose to cram this story into a two hour runtime and the result is a less than satisfying \"team up\" film with wasted potential.",

Whoever got paid to touch up Henry Cavall, should have to pay back his payment. I had such hopes for the movie that was to bring all my favorite superheroes together. They need a total reboot of the series. Nothing against Amy Adams but she was also miscast as Lois Lane.  The villain  Steppenwolf meh. Give me a real villain to get behind and believe in.

You get a sense of how much they did in reshoots just even from how many of Henry Cavill's scenes show him with the weird mustache cover-up. How they weren't able to do that better is beyond me. The problems boil down to a few main things. Like BvS, they try to do WAY TOO MUCH world-building in a single movie. They introduce three new characters (Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg), bring back one that still has never had their own establishing movie (Batman), and desperate to show us both Themyscira and Atlantis. Their characterization of Bruce Wayne/Batman is completely wrong. Steppenwolf is not a very good villain. Pretty two dimensional. And the writing just isn't great. Clunky dialogue. Sloppy exposition. It just rings false too often. There is, however, enough potential here that I am very interested to see the Snyder cut in 2021. If that version fixes a significant number of these problems, they should make it canon and disregard this hack job.",

            "content": "Messy, cheesy, poorly written, with some awful performances. Still I think this is an improvement (slightly) over the nihilistic vision Zack Snyder had of the this universe. The reshoots are painfully obvious, within the same scene Affleck looks like the lean, tough Bruce Wayne of BVS (Snyder shots) and a moment later he looks miserable, overweight, and in need of serious rehab (Whedon shots). Whedon and Snyder have completely different styles and visions, and so we get a cut and paste patchwork of a movie that won't satisfy fans of either director. The best scene is when Superman fights the league and has some genuinely fun moments (flash's reaction to Superman's speed). Overall though I only was able to enjoy this movie in any way because my expectations were at rock bottom, I walked in expecting a disaster and that's what I saw. The CGI looks like it is 20 years old, Steppenwolf is a terrible villain- not only does he look terrible but his character gets absolutely zero development. Cavill's upper lip looks truly disturbing in some scenes, but at least he smiles a few times and seems to be enjoying himself a bit here (unlike MOS and BVS where he is a stale, mopey, sad Superman). I was a huge Justice League fan growing up, and if I had gone in expecting even a halfway decent movie I would have been horribly disappointed. However by the time Justice League came around I had long given up hope in the DCEU being any good at all. Oh well, some of the solo movies have been good (WW, Shazam), let's hope they can continue to make some good stand alones.",

            "content": "The very first scene of JUSTICE LEAGUE pretty much sums up the film in a way.\n\nSuperman had just finished a rescue mission, and kids are doing an interview with him for their blog. The point of view is from a shaky phone camera. The kids giddily ask the polite hero what's his favourite thing about Earth. \n\nHe turns his head and thinks for a few seconds. He frowns. The answer should be easy, but it's not. He then smiles and turns back to the camera. He starts to speak and his words are cut short as the scene brutally ends.\n\nIt's probably my favourite scene of the film, showing a certain sense of poignancy in Henry Cavill's acting, and in the symbolic way the scene is cut short, the same way his life was in the unjustly maligned BATMAN V SUPERMAN. It has a charming sense of ''reality'' that has been lacking in a lot of the DC Films and translate well the inherent goodness of the Man of Steel as well as the admiration children may have for such a being.\n\nIt also demonstrates one of the movie's failings. A sense that something good may occur, but we are unable to reach that point exactly. We are left wanting more in the form of emotional involvement with the characters.\n\nThe following scene is a throwback to the last scene of BVS, where the world mourns its alien saviour, played beautifully to a Leonard Cohen song performed by Sigrid. While it is stylish and gorgeous, I am still unable to really feel the right amount of sympathy for Superman as he is portrayed in this latest incarnation. While I believe Cavill's turn as the Man of Steel is perfect casting, the way the character was handled was awkward at best, and the ending of MAN OF STEEL was apocalyptic enough that I can't understand how people would really miss the man who levelled a whole city during one of his battles. It just seems that he hasn't earned the worship that is thrown his way by the time BATMAN V SUPERMAN comes along. While the destruction of Metropolis is a good fodder for what transpires in BVS, giving Bruce Wayne reasons to see Superman as a threat, it also makes his status as a saviour a bit difficult to fathom.\n\nBut I digress. How is the JUSTICE LEAGUE movie?\n\nI'm on the fence about it. You may have gotten from this blog that I am a good public for that type of film. Ever since I was watching the Batman TV show as a child, and was flabbergasted by the Donner SUPERMAN movie when I was 13 years old, I've had a soft spot for superhero films. They are just inherently perfect for the medium of film, offering clear heroes and villains, obvious obstacles to conquer, and if it fails dramatically, then there is the added bonus of seeing grown ups running around in goofy costumes. \n\nAnd while the Marvel movies have managed to capture lighting in a bottle, managing over and over again to find the right tone to treat those characters successfully in movies (to varying degrees of success, of course), with the exception of WONDER WOMAN, DC have been struggling steadily ever since they rebooted Superman with MAN OF STEEL. The tonally grim series didn't seem to gel with the audience, and while director Zach Snyder has an undeniable talent for some strong visuals and effective moments in films, as well as translating comic books to the screen with an insane amount of reverence  for the source material (one has to think of his exceptional 300 or WATCHMEN) he sometimes has a hard time tying all those moments together adequately in an effective and engaging narrative. \n\nSo there were no small amounts of hope that when Snyder got replaced with Joss Whedon (who had done such an amazing job bringing the Marvel characters together in the wildly entertaining THE AVENGERS) to finish JUSTICE LEAGUE that maybe his magic touch may help out what could have been another dreary tale of superheroics. \n\nThe results are unconvincing to say the least. The film ends up feeling like a Frankenstein monster, made up of ill-connecting parts. At times gloomy, and at times light hearted, it seems to have a hard time finding its proper footing, and truly engaging the viewer. \n\nRemember how awkward that scene in CIVIL WAR (an otherwise very fine movie) was, when Tony Stark ends up at Peter Parker's room to hire him in his vendetta against Captain America? How forced it felt, so that Spider-Man could finally be part of the Cinematic Marvel Universe? The whole first half of the film, as Batman and Wonder Woman goes around trying to recruit heroes for their mission in defeating Steppenwolf, a CGI MacGuffin that will unite them all in their quest, feels equally as forced. Not unpleasant, but forced. \n\nThe rest of the story line moves  along at a fast pace, leaving little time to spend on characterization. And some developments are downright absurd, in that comic book kind of way. We all know that Superman HAS TO come back from the dead. And when he does, we are treated to a proper superhero fight that is undeniably a staple of the genre by now. The reasoning that leads to the resurrection, and the means to the end in itself, never rang true to me. It's one of those things you can't think too much about, or it will drive you mad. The verisimilitude proned by Richard Donner when he made SUPERMAN in 1978 is pretty much out the window.\n\nAs for the characters themselves, well, let's take them one at a time.\n\nCYBORG, who sports a rather garish exoskeleton robotic body, has plenty of pathos, and there is a lot of potential to develop his troubled personae, where his human mind is overtaken at times by his mechanized self, but actor Ray Fisher doesn't have much opportunities to stretch his thespian muscles in this film. At the very least, a scene near the end of the film seem to imply a change of armour that will look closer to the more streamlined one viewed in the comics. As for exploring his pathos further, we are promised a movie somewhere down the line.\n\nAQUAMAN, as portrayed with gusto by the robust Jason Momoa, is a striking departure from the oft mocked source material, whose essence was rather lame. In the film, he is closer in character to Marvel's Sub-Mariner, who shared with Aquaman a very similar origin. His exuberance is a stark contrast to Cyborg's grim self-hatred, but he seldom gets to use his water driven power in the film. I wish I would have seen him ''Talk to fishes'', something that will also be kept for his solo movie, no doubt.\n\nTHE FLASH is a curious mixed bag, as the interpretation by young Ezra Miller is dynamic and quirky, not unlike Tom Holland's Spider-Man. He steals most of his scenes, but certainly not with his costume, which is a certified eyesore. One can hope that, as Tony Stark did for Spidey, Bruce Wayne will help him upgrade his garment for something a bit more graceful. His relationship with his convict father is reminiscent of the one explored in the recent TV show, and it's safe to assume that his solo movie will deal with absolving his father's guilt . Rumour has it that it would be the FLASHPOINT storyline, (Already adapted in animation form in a fantastic straight to video DC film.) in which his attempts at travelling through time to prevent his mother's murder will create a series of paradox, including one where Bruce Wayne is the one who is murdered in that fateful alley, and the father takes on the mantle of Batman. Judging from the beginning of BVS, I look forward to Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Batman. \n\nAs far as the depiction of his powers, they pale in comparison to the outstanding way super speed was portrayed in the latest two X-Men movies, where the scenes involving Quicksilver were spectacular showstoppers. \n\nWONDER WOMAN still benefits from the considerable charm and strength Gal Gadot managed to convey in her phenomenal solo movie earlier this year, and her scene stealing debut in BVS. Gadot has managed to stun the naysayers who doubted she had the physical attributes to play a comic book hero  and become a Wonder Woman every bit as memorable as Lynda Carter was in her own way.\n\nBen Affleck's BATMAN continues to impress, and still manages to stand out as one of the best movie Dark Knight out there. They have tried providing him with a lighter attitude, which is not always convincing. Rumours around states he may be replaced by Jake Gyllenhal in future films. Can't say I am enthusiastic about the prospect, but we'll see.\n\nAs stated before, Henry Cavill's SUPERMAN does return, and once again, there seems to have been an effort to lighten this character too, and in his case, it feels more natural. It seems a bit more like MY Superman, and I feel a bit more confident about his further adventures.\n\nBut will there be more adventures? As it stands now, the film hasn't made a killing at the box office, and after the dismal critical performances of SUICIDE SQUAD, MAN OF STEEL and BATMAN V SUPERMAN, one can imagine how nervous the producers must be at this point, trying to build a series in the mold of Marvel. There are already plans for films to be made out of this particular continuity.\n\nBut Marvel teamed up its characters in an organic way, introducing all of them in their own movies first, so that he viewer is already involved with them and the interactions just flow easier. In this case, half of the characters are brand new, and struggle to find their place in an especially busy story line ripped out straight from Jack Kirby's highly imaginative Fourth World saga.\n\nSpeaking of which, it's nice to see the King have his own isolated credit at the end of the film. A nice way to celebrate his 100 birthday. His touch in the film is not as visual as in THOR RAGNAROK, but more in his concepts pertaining to Darkseid, Apokolips, Steppenwof, the Mother Boxes, Boom Tubes and the Parademons. I'm still dreaming to see the actual New Gods up on the screen.\n\nOne last thing to mention is the score by Danny Elfman, who has travelled the roads alongside superhuman beings many times before. He does a serviceable job, whose highlights are mainly the use of leitmotivs from his own score to the 1989 BATMAN and John Williams' SUPERMAN. Can't say that there is much of a hummable theme to carry out of the theatre with me.\n\nAnd that's the case pretty much of this JUSTICE LEAGUE. I didn't find the film offensively bad as some critics imply. I even liked some parts of it very much. I am curious to see more adventures with those characters, but not particularly eager. I need a bit more emotional attachment to the characters, which has yet to be build upon. I need more scenes like the reunion between Clark, Lois and Martha in a field, which felt warm and real, while a lot of the film feels a bit cold and artificial.\n\nLike the heroes in the movie, DC Films are trying to break through the creeping gloominess that pervades that series, like the tendrils of Apokolips ravaging through the countryside. Unlike the Justice League, they succeed only partly.",

For example when Batman was on the ground after Superman threw him he said something about internal bleeding. This did not seem like Batman at all and was definately not needed. The comedy felt as though DC was trying to replicate all of The Avengers's movies comedy, but sometimes in the movie it wasn't needed at all. \n- The backstories to the other characters (Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman) felt a little rushed, and even after watching the movie, we still don't know much about them. \n- Logic issues and questions. Why was Superman attacking Batman if they became friends at the end of BvS? Why were they even fighting in the underground sewer in the first place? Why was Steppenwolf even there? \n\nThe movie overall felt like it was trying to correct the mistakes it made in BvS and at the same time replicate The Avengers but with DC characters. But despite these flaws, I still enjoyed the movie and I find it to be very rewatchable. This is also a good step up from BvS and Suicide Squad when it comes to Warner Brothers making a movie with a group of DC characters.",

It seems like DC learns the hard way that not even Jason Momoa can salvage something as gratuitous as \u2018Justice League'\u2014which is a shame, really. It's these things that make all the difference and continue to place the DC Extended Universe steps below their wildly successful comic franchise counterpart. Don't get me wrong, Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince hit just the right notes but the rest seemed like  an irredeemable mess from the start. They made Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton in their problematic Marvel roles look good. I know many were skeptic about Ben Affleck playing Batman but we're all thrilled to know he mostly played a guy dressed as a bat and throughout the film, he's astute enough to remind us so. On the upside, the film is two hours long\u2013long enough for fans to be unable to render the good parts with the atrocious so it all levels out in the end. Don't get me wrong; in reference to the parts that could have made this film effective, there were a few points that kept this from being a total waste. The blatant attempt at humour that was absent from earlier films were, at best, almost passable. The visuals were also crisp and very promising\u2014one of many in a see of would-have-beens.

The action sequences are mostly yawn-worthy, and the villain, Steppenwolf, a big CGI'd piece of ugliness, isn't worth the price of admission. The acting is alright, and it has its moments, but despite being marginally better than \"Suicide Squad\", it ends yet another disappointment for the growing franchise.\n45/100",

And even though it's a total mess, it's de-Snydered enough to not be as much of a dark, dull dirge as Batman V Superman. It makes The Avengers look like The Godfather Part II. Aquaman and the guy that played Cyborg were surprisingly good. Ezra Miller breaks even on the annoying/adorkable front. And Affleck is still a decent actor in a dodgy suit and a flaccid, jibbering thankless role.\nIt's 90% exposition and contrivance, 90% CGI and 110% reshoots. Basically think of everything bad that happens in movies you hate and this one pretty much has it all. It even has four poor Russians living near a nuclear reactor who have cracks in the wall with the shotgun on it, candles because, you know, they're poor, and a Russian nesting doll because, you know, they're Russians. That's basically says it all about this move. Neither Snyder, nor Whedon, nor Warners are at fault for this movie alone; absolutely every single person that worked on it from caterers to casting agents, from runners to ringleaders should all equally share the blame for this fairly inoffensive but undoubted waste of everybody's time.",

Click the Settings icon.\nWhile Justice League is better than Batman and Robin, that does not mean that it is above the mediocre, the biggest problem is that the film is so childish, the characters lack personality, the closest we have to a poorly developed personality would come being that of a boy who is angry at his dad for saving his life (Cyborg), the way Batman gathers the members is so simple is like a superhero ball game, Batman and the wonder woman go over there, over there asking everyone if they want to join their team of super friends, and all without considering it too much end up accepting. Something that I liked about Avengers: The avengers was that they really spend most of the movie stripping between them than with the villain of the movie which is completely normal and realistic because it really is the first time they live with each other, and it is normal that they do not get along, but in this movie no, here everyone is super friends who have no problem between them, which is the opposite of real life.\nAnd of all the villains they could choose, they chose Stevephen Wolf, the villain that only the fat man of the Simpsons knows and three more people in the world, instead of having put Darkside they put to that gift nobody that their objective is so silly and simple, destroy the earth because ......... Yes?\nNow everyone will think that darkside is the copy of thanos when it is the other way around, darkside came out first, in fact the avengers are the copy of the justice league, but now nobody will believe that because DC has not made good use of its content.\nThe biggest problem is that the film focuses more on making a story for the next films than on making a good story for this one, that seller is the biggest problem in the movie, great proof that they didn't try very hard are the special effects, Let's be honest for the era in which we are those special effects are no longer valid, they are simply bad, and flash has its blue rays Why ........? Because Zack Snyder came from h $% # s.\n\n\nDo you want to add a title to this image? Click on the Settings icon.\nThe movie had done well not to show Superman in the trailers, you didn't know how it was going to come back or how it was going to be, etc., but it is made to lose all that and gives us the typical story that revived someone and becomes evil blah blah blah, and as always love solves everything and a bing bang bung Superman returns to normal, and no one bothers to investigate because he is alive, instead the film better concentrates on making jokes fools, but this blatantly believes that if you copy a wonder your use formula stupid jokes everyone would love their movies, bad DC, bad.\nAnd as almost always happens in this type of movies lately, everything else is more of the same, they beat the villain and everyone lives according to the idea that men with super powers without supervision live among them.\nIn conclusion Justice League is a simple and mediocre action movie that although I dare to say that it was something attractive to see the justice league for the first time together in a live action movie, but it does not stand out in any sense, the villain It's boring and repetitive as is the story, the special effects are terrible and I want to say that this criticism would be worth nothing if it were those marvelitas that praise a wonder as if it were a god, so if you are a DC fan and this movie you nice to let me tell you that the only thing you are is a sheep that has to be told what to do, what to think and that you never accept that your pastor can be wrong, assuming it is somewhat exaggerated to give this movie a 3/10 so that's why I'll give a 4/10 better.",

From what I could see though, the upper lip CGI was only in the scene at the beginning with the little kids asking him questions about himself and his love of Earth. During his subsequent scenes after being resurrected, it appeared to be all Cavill. Speaking of Cavill, he looked absolutely amazing. I have always admired the men and women in the MCU and DCEU (also the TV shows) and the efforts they have made to look the parts. As a fan of superhero live action adaptations, I salute the men and women who put themselves and their bodies through absolute hell for our entertainment. Jason Momoa was awesome as Aquaman, the sequence with him sitting on the Lasso of Truth was awe inspiring and showed his range as Arthur. Ezra Miller as Flash can grow on me, but I will probably always prefer Grant Gustin from the TV show. Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck stole the show as they showed that they can have good chemistry together on screen. Going forward with out Batfleck might be troublesome but doable in my mind. This movie works in its own world as a part of the DCEU but was a bit rushed by Warner Bros with Avengers: Infinity War right around the corner and the success Marvel was having with their interweaving storylines. Teasing us with a Justice League vs Injustice League sequence of movies may allow us to really flesh out all these characters and also introduce new actors in established roles.

On the plus side it's colorful and the Flash has some funny lines with good delivery. Mostly a dud, but not a dumpster fire like Batman v Superman.\n\nFull disclosure, we saw this movie last week but accidentally missed the first 30 minutes and didn't realize it until we got out and it wasn't as late as it should have been. We re-watched it today and my opinion of it actually didn't change that much. If it were a made for TV movie or a 90's direct to video special I would have said it wasn't too bad.

What's my verdict? It was a good, fun movie, but it had so much interference from the studio that they blocked out what was good in the first place. It kickstarted the franchise with the characters but they weren't given enough time before they jumped ahead and put their own stamp of being an Avengers ripoff. Now I'm a big comic fan. I like both DC characters as well as Marvel. There was just too much input with this. We needed to establish a Flash film, Aquaman film, Cyborg film, then this would've been okay to do...but seeing them try to remove and add a mustache' from Superman, it looked awkward. There wasn't enough chances to grow with the characters who were just introduced. This was a chance for filmmakers to do their jobs, not some money milking suit and tie guys. It was directed by two guys. Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon. Totally opposite poles. This was shoved into theaters with not enough care. Then what happened then? We had an Aquaman movie. It was good! Then we had Shazam! I hadn't seen it, but I hear it's worthwhile. Working on spin-off's with them, I think that was where the logic lies. Set up a long string, then do the Justice League while it's hot. I think this could've been a four star movie. But as of now, it seemed like there was too many cooks in this kitchen.",

Steppenwolf had his moments where I *wanted* him to get there.)\n\nThe other memorable thing about this film is Batman as a total sadsack who is only saved from his own moroseness by moments of self-effacing irony. Was Ben Affleck just playing his own recent personal life instead of Batman? Again, I'm not sure whether it sort of worked or really was clunky, but it was a notably demythologized version of Batman.\n\nThe Flash was fun, and I wouldn't mind seeing an entire movie based on this actor doing this take of this character. Jason Momoa's schtik was out of sync with everything else happening in the movie in a way that was more jarring than fun. I also wouldn't mind seeing more of Cyborg.",

My only complaint really is the first half and the final action sequence are about the same length in time, but the ending and twist made up for it.

They were foiled by a unified army that included the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, mankind, and a Green Lantern. After repelling Steppenwolf's army, the Mother Boxes were separated and hidden in locations on the planet. In the present, mankind is in mourning over Superman for two years, whose death triggers the Mother Boxes to reactivate and Steppenwolf's return to Earth. In an effort to regain favor with his master Darkseid, Steppenwolf aims to gather the boxes to form \"The Unity\", which will destroy Earth's ecology and terraform it in the image of Steppenwolf's homeworld. Steppenwolf retrieves the Mother Box from Themyscira, prompting Queen Hippolyta to warn her daughter Diana (Gal Gadot) of Steppenwolf's return. Diana joins Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) in his attempt to unite other metahumans to their cause, with Wayne going after Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) and Barry Allen (Ezra Miller), while Diana tries to locate Victor Stone (Ray Fisher). Wayne fails to persuade Curry, but manages to recruit an enthusiastic Allen onto the team. Although Diana fails to convince Stone to join, he agrees to help them locate the threat if he discovers their location. Stone later joins the team after his father Silas and several other S.T.A.R. Labs employees are kidnapped by Steppenwolf seeking to acquire the Mother Box from mankind. Steppenwolf attacks an Atlantean outpost to retrieve the next Mother Box, forcing Curry into action. The team receives intel from Commissioner James Gordon leading them to Steppenwolf's army, based in an abandoned facility under Gotham Harbor. Although the group manages to rescue the kidnapped employees, the facility is flooded during combat, which traps the team until Curry helps delay the flood so they can escape. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box, which he had hidden, for the group to analyze. Stone reveals that his father used the Mother Box to rebuild Stone's body after an accident almost cost him his life. Wayne decides to use the Mother Box to resurrect Superman (Henry Cavill), not only to help them fight off Steppenwolf's invasion, but also to restore hope to mankind. Diana and Curry are hesitant about the idea, but Wayne forms a secret contingency plan in case Superman returns as hostile...\n\nJustice League received mixed reviews. It was praised for its action sequences and acting (primarily by Gadot and Miller) but criticized for the screenplay, pacing and CGI, as well as its thin plot, and the underdeveloped villain. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Justice League leaps over a number of DC movies, but its single bound isn't enough to shed the murky aesthetic, thin characters, and chaotic action that continue to dog the franchise.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the cast, especially Gadot, and saying \"It's a putting-the-band-together origins movie, executed with great fun and energy.\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, praising the cast but criticizing the action sequences and writing, saying: \"The scenes of the League members together, bickering and bonding, spike the film with humor and genuine feeling, creating a rooting interest in the audience. Without it, the film would crumble.\" Conversely, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter, while praising Gadot and Miller, called the film visually ugly and boring, saying, \"Fatigue, repetition and a laborious approach to exposition are the keynotes of this affair, which is also notable for how Ben Affleck, donning the bat suit for the second time, looks like he'd rather be almost anywhere else but here.\"\n\nIt still boggles my mind how DC Comics continuously fails with their superhero universe on screen compared to what Marvel does. Great ones from DC is \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Man Of Steel\", while \"Justice League\" is hardly amongst the great ones. With an estimated production budget of $300 million, Justice League is one of the most expensive films ever made. The film grossed $657 million worldwide against a break-even point of $750 million, becoming a box office bomb and losing the studio an estimated $60 million. Predictable plot, uninspiring storyline, bad pacing, underdeveloped villain, strange character development and the overuse of CGI are major flaws in this film. I hate what they have done with The Flash and the same goes for Aquaman and what\u00b4s going on with the Cyborg character? While Ben Affleck simply can\u00b4t play Batman. Gal Gadot and Henry Cavill are ok, but not half as good as they are in \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Man Of Steel\". However, the fact is that the film suffered from the change of original director Zach Snyder (whom I think normally delivers) due to a personal tragedy which led also to the disposal of the movie's original composer Junkie XL and a re-editing of the film. Director Joss Whedon was called in to finish the film and I assume that was not all that easy for him as well. With a budget of $300 million the film should logically look and be so much better than the end result. \"Justice League\" is simply a foul ball and a failure. Pass on this. \n",

Which in the end delivers a jumbled mess of a film, but unlike BVS and Suicide Squad there is a love of the material going into the film that I previously couldn't find in the other films. The cast is exceptional Gal Gadot fresh off of Wonder Woman is still killing it with her performance, Jason Mamoa is fun and charming in his role as Aquaman, Fisher as Cyborg gives a grounded and comic accurate portrayal and even Cavill is starting to have more fun as the Man Of Steel. Afleck is good, but he looks like he's much less interested than in BVS which is a disappointment to me, Miller gives a funny and nice performance as The Scarlet Speedster, But I personally as a Flash(TV) fan can't see anyone but Grant in the role, which I know is wrong, but Grant does a great job. The visuals are a huge downgrade from BVS and Wonder Woman and it feels like playing a video game sometimes, Steppanwolf is a terrible villain who doesn't pose a threat at all, and the plot of collecting the motherboxes also feels like a video game plot, but in the end it's still nice to some of the best superheroes ever on screen together, it could've been so much more, but for what we got it was okay, and I'd watch it again.",

You have some Ideas of potential and gravitas for where Zack Snyder is going with his serious of DC Movies, and where the WB wanted to go. It's more so a clash of ideas and concepts never unite, and create difficulty for fans to truly believe their \"All In\" despite corse correction.

I don't have a problem with Affleck, Miller was a mixed bag and perhaps that was due to the two different directors.  Now for Fisher's Cyborg, WTF.  A bizarre suit design, poor CGI, poor editing to the point where at different scenes he was not scaled to size and another where he was pasted in wrong.  Seems like this would of been a better second movie with the first one having the hero's putting all the villains in Suicide Squad in prison.

It was a clumsy and uneven blend of two different styles; not surprising as it had two different directors. \n\nThe performances were good in some parts and awesome in others. Jason Momoa definitely lived up to the hype. Ezra Miller was just as funny as Grant Gustin and came off as very realistic. Ray Fisher wasn't as present, but all of his scenes were great and I really hope to see more of him. Gal Gadot didn't have the same flair as she did from her previous films but she was wonderful nonetheless; in both action and non-action scenes. Ben Affleck was all right but one could tell that he was not enjoying himself. Henry Cavill had some great moments but they were heavily shadowed by the horrid CGI editing to remove his moustache. And Ciaran Hinds was even worse than Christopher Eccleston from Thor: The Dark World though that is less his fault than it is those who removed his other scenes.\n\nIt does not help that Danny Elfman chose to use his classic Batman theme instead of trying to go a different route. On one hand, I acknowledge that he a had a short amount of time to work with. On the other, it seems that he would not have done anything differently if he did have more time.\n\nAll in all, the film tried too hard to be like the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet not enough to actually succeed. The movie's tone is cheesy, turgid and ultimately uninspired. \n\nConclusion: Release The Snyder Cut\n\n\n",

I liked Batman in Batman vs Superman he was awesome and tough as nails, here he lacks confidence as batman and Bruce Wayne. The flash made the comedy in the movie and kept it together. I still don't understand why DC & Warner Bros. rushed to get this movie done. If they would've taken their time and introduced the characters in their own films I think Justice League would have been way better.

Ben Affleck really outdid himself going on to show us different batman themes.

Freeze breath was epic. Steppenwolf is a little forgettable but that's the point this whole movie is based to form the justice league for the greater villian Darkside.

The one thing that they\u00e2(TM)ve gotten incredibly right was casting Gal Gadot (Diana Prince/Wonder Woman). She was the best part of Batman v. Superman, great in her solo film, and was the highlight here. I also liked Jason Momoa (Arthur Curry/Aquaman). He brought a charisma to the character that I never expected and was another highlight. Ezra Miller (Barry Allen/The Flash) also had some delightful scenes. Another thing I like about DC films is their fight scenes. They often feel realistic and hard hitting. This movie had some of that. At two hours, it\u00e2(TM)s shorter than a lot of superhero movies and it actually does fly by surprisingly quickly.\n\nWeaknesses: I still can\u00e2(TM)t get behind Ben Affleck (Bruce Wayne/Batman) in this role, while the CGI used on Henry Cavill (Clark Kent/Superman) was so distracting, I couldn\u00e2(TM)t take any of his scenes seriously. A lot of the CGI in this movie just looked bad, to be honest. The villain and his army are a terrible CGI fest. Ciaran Hinds (Steppenwolf) tries, but the character has nothing to him. He\u00e2(TM)s unbelievably generic and you never feel like he\u00e2(TM)s a true threat. I also thought the underwater scenes looked bad. It looks much better in the Aquaman trailers. The plot is disjointed. It seems like they tried way too many things and none of them stick. It\u00e2(TM)s hard to compare this to the MCU, but one reason their team up movies work is because of the chemistry among the cast. This group doesn\u00e2(TM)t really have that. Ray Fisher (Victor Stone/Cyborg) is another actor who tries, but is given next to nothing to work with.\n\nOverall: I enjoyed some of the performances and characters, as well as a hint of the action. The story just completely lets everyone down and it isn\u00e2(TM)t helped by bad special effects and a poor villain.",

That is what Justice league needed because you spend to much time getting to like the characters, and finding out what they can do rather than already liking them, and knowing who they are and what they can do, and there is not a lot of time with these characters in this movie to begin with, only a mere 2 hours ten minutes of which is the end credits. Justice league also suffers from a divided tone. It is clear that there were two different directors with two different visions of this film. The first two thirds of this film give a glimpse of what this movie could have been with some hints of Josh Weadon's vision, but over all was still Zack Snyder's movie then the third act comes, and you realize how much potential was lost in this film. This movie also needed the many scenes that were removed, and we know they exist due to the trialers. This movie was enjoyable, but not all that we should have gotten.",

Though I admit there are a few bad things in this movie, I thought Superman's return from the dead was kind of anti-climatic and deus ex machina, and the movie occasionally struggles to add the Zack Snyder aesthetic in the more fun tone in the film. Really the main problem as to why this film and the darker and more convoluted BvS: Dawn of Justice Theatrical Edition both failed is because of one thing: studio interference. Zack Snyder left post-production of this movie because of a family tragedy and the studio brought in Joss Whedon (writer and director of this movie's rival The Avengers and it's first sequel) to supervise post-production, but at the same time they also ordered re-writes and reshoots to make the film more upbeat than Snyder's original vision (which I thought would have been really good) and Snyder received sole director's credit. The same thing with the Theatrical Edition of BvS, the studio ordered random cuts of that movie, regardless of how important they were to the story, and the Ultimate Edition was the version it was supposed to be before it started.",

Honestly, when your making Flash dark AND super awkward, you think, \"Even tv can to the Flash better than the movies.\" \n\n   The villain, Stephen Wolfe, was so bad that you probably just found out what his name was. He was such a bad villain that there was emotional tension between the Justice League and him, it's literally the Justice League trying to stop Stephen Wolfe because... He is bad. Don't make a villain that his only purpose is to fill in the spot of a villain. I wonder what they were thinking when they decided that Stephen Wolfe would be the bad guy, when choosing a villain for iconic superheroes, don't use someone you've never heard of. \n\n   And then comes the plot... that one bad guy trying to steal boxes to do evil things and getting stopped by a newly formed band of low-budget superheroes--- what a great plot. But actually I think that they probably should have introduced a few more characters and established a big, bad guy before making, what will probably be the most important movie of the DCEU. Overall, Justice League is underdeveloped, if it would have been given more before it was made, and maybe a better plot, Justice League could have been a really good movie.",

He spouts one liners and says: \"No, this can't be.\" like every cartoon character who was a bad guy in history. The only saving grace to this film is Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and the film knew this based on promotional material. The new heroes introduced are so forced and desperate to imprint on audiences that they are given traits over personalities to define them. Flash is nervous and talks too much like a man pumped with caffine. Cyborg walks all tough like and whispers somberly. Aquaman is made into a tough biker with tattoos who says: \"Yeah\" whenever he does something cool. Snyder does not care about anything but the mood and the second director who's name I don't want to mention, thus tarnishing his reputation further only slaps in quirky humor.  It's a mess really and unfortunately this film was set up to never have opportunities in the first place due to the rushed nature of production. When a franchise is raced out to be competitive and cash in on fan nostalgia without any regard for story or quality control this is the end result. If you like loud noises and lots of superficial explosions then grab some popcorn and enjoy. If you want to take your DC universe seriously just watch Nolan's Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and the first two Christopher Reave Superman renditions.",

Here is what works for this film:  Wonder Woman (easily the best that DC has put out) Aquaman (very funny and rugged), but that is it.  Cybory (decent, but the special effects of his robot self looks really cheesy).  Batman - Wow! Ben Affleck is terrible as Batman.  He may have passed George Clooney as the worst to pt on the Bat Costume.  The suit looks terrible and his Batman voice is laughable and cringe worthy.  Superman - Ouch! what a one dimensional actor Mr. Cavill is.  Flash - How did they mess him up?  The suit is bad and Ezra Miller has no business playing Barry Allen.  The Villain looks like he belongs in Middle Earth trying to hunt Frodo Baggins.  Any fan of superhero movies should check this movie out, but don't expect the MCU level quality.",

I love this version of Aquaman. Unlike the comics, you could get chills watching him do stuff. Cyborg was impressive, especially his CGI. As far as I'm aware this was the first live-action movie Cyborg. I am a huge fan of the Flash but this version is not my cup of tea. Ezra Miller is an incredible actor but his dialogue was trash. He seemed to... nerdy. His jokes were ok though. Henry, Affleck and Gadot had fine parts. There were so many references that make me excited for the upcoming Shazam, Flash, Wonder Woman and Joker movie and sequels.\n\nI would recommend this if you liked any one of the previous DCEU movies. I would age it 12 for strong violence, language, and spooky scenes. I do believe for the future of the DCEU.\n\nGrade: C+",

The plot is also not good and misses all opportunities to present a villain who likes to hate for the right reasons, but he is only generic. And what reason to continue with the universe ?! It will not work at all if they continue on this \"roller coaster\" in all attempts that will end in an hour.",

            "content": "This was a pretty bad movie. Miles better than Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, but worse than Man of Steel. Justice League is the third worst DCEU film. Justice League was the worst DC film and worst comic book movie of 2017. Justice League was the most disappointing film of 2017 (not the worst cause it's totally far from the worst, just the most disappointing). There were at least some good things I liked about this movie, but sadly the negatives outweigh the positives. I liked some of the action scenes. I liked the bank robbery scene at the beginning and I liked the part where Superman showed up in the third act and defeated Steppenwolf. In that final battle scene in the third act, he was actually fortunately felt like the classic comic book Superman perfectly portrayed by Christopher Reeve. So that thankfully means no more mopey, gloomy, emo, depressed Superman anymore. At the end of the movie, we finally got the colorful, jolly Superman we all wanted in the DCEU since Man of Steel (even if it was just for a while in the end of the final act and in the resolution). Another thing I liked about this film was Aquaman's \"cool guy entrance\" when he was first introduced into the film. I liked Joe Morton as Victor Stone's (a.k.a. Cyborg) dad. He was perfectly cast in that role. That role was definitely made for him (even if it was just a small role). I thought at least some of the humor was amusing. Now the negatives....  Batman gave away his identity to the other members of the Justice League. So now Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg all know him as Bruce Wayne. That ruins his character, because the Batman I grew up with from the source material, comics, and Justice League animated series never trusted anyone (other than his butler Alfred). He never gave his identity away to the others members of the Justice League in the comics and shows. Batman is supposed to have trust issues. In this movie, he very easily and intentionally gave away his identity to Diana Prince, Arthur Curry, Barry Allen, and Victor Stone. That automatically ruins the character of Batman. Diana Prince a.k.a. Wonder Woman bitches about her old dead boyfriend, Steve Trevor, too much in this film. Barry Allen a.k.a. the Flash was too comedic and kept cracking jokes. Barry Allen is supposed to be the serious and emotional Flash, not the humorous wise-cracking Flash. Wally West is supposed to be the humorous, funny, wise-cracking Flash. In fact, Wally West is supposed to be the Justice League Flash, not Barry Allen. The movie got it all wrong. Oh, and we should've gotten a Flash solo movie before Justice League so he could've gotten much better character development. We the audience barely got to connect with him in this movie cause we barely knew him in this film. Now, Aquaman....I personally feel that Jason Momoa should've played Lobo instead of Aquaman. Speaking of which, Aquaman should've gotten his own solo movie before Justice League. We barely got to know him in this movie and he had very little character development. Cyborg should have been first established in a DCEU Teen Titans movie or in his own DCEU solo movie before being in a Justice League movie. We barely got to know him in this movie, so he had poor character development. The amount of terrible CGI in this movie was ridiculous. Some scenes in the movie even kind of looked like a video game because of the overuse of CGI in which the visuals looked terrible. The villain, Steppenwolf, was a very forgettable villain, disappointing, and wasted super villain. His motivation was questionable and nonexistent. I also felt that there was a lack of chemistry with the cast and characters in the movie. The DCEU probably needs a reboot. The DCEU is a trainwreck and a big mess. Wonder Woman is still the only good DCEU film. Justice League had a lot of potential, but it was sadly wasted. Warner Bros. Pictures/DC Entertainment shouldn't have rushed to play catch-up with Marvel Studios/Marvel Entertainment. I feel like DC needs their own studio. They need their own version of Marvel Studios called \"DC Studios\". Warner Bros. is just ruining DC's live-action movie rep on the big screen.\n\nRating: 4.2/10",

The crossover hot of the heels of the critically acclaimed 'Wonder Woman' introduces new threats to the Earth which our heroes must unite to battle. The standout star of this movie, a decision perhaps pushed by Warner Bros. after the success of her standalone adventure, is Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). See is the only hero with a true sense of purpose in this film; Batman is lost after the death of Superman, Superman is, well dead, and the other heroes are on their own. Perhaps what this feature does best is introduce us to new characters, reintroduce the trinity and get underway with its plot all in two hours - with a longer runtime this movie would have thrived. \n\n'Justice League' monumentally changes the tone of this movie universe with less serious plots and personalities - the introduction of Barry Allen primes the quirkiness of the universe. Ezra Miller's Flash is the youthful, energetic 'child' of the group that draws in many laughs from the audience. Yet many are discrediting the movie due to the apparent loss of Zack Snyder's unique vision set up through 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice'. While true, his vision has been traded for a much more enjoyable and comic-accurate representation of all the heroes. \n\nThe plot of this movie is by no means a cinematic masterpiece, but the movie itself is an engaging battle between six vastly differing heroes with unique and incompatible personalities (Aquaman and Cyborg would certainly create a unique 'Bro-duo' in the sequel). \n\nI recommend to any big fans of the DC brand.",

Now, one year later, I've began to really notice its problems. This realization came after I saw Avengers: Infinity War. The whole movie was about Thanos trying to get all the infinity stones so he can do what he wants to the universe, and does so at the end. (That's basically a quick summary; I know there's much more to it) And all the heroes spend the whole movie going planet by planet, battle to battle, trying to stop him from getting each of the six stones. This one premise makes up for what ends up being, in my opinion, the best film in the MCU. And the upcoming sequel will focus on the aftermath of Thanos getting all the stones and snapping half the universe out of existence. Justice League is kind of like this; the main villain, Steppenwolf (who is an underdeveloped, boring villain) is searching for 3 mother boxes, which will allow him and his army to conquer the world. About 3 quarters into the movie, he's already done this. The rest of the movie then followed the League trying to stop him from continuing his plans now that he has the 3 boxes. It all feels rushed. This movie was originally gonna be two parts, which probably means they would split getting the boxes and the aftermath into two separate parts. And boy, I really wish they did that. That's just one problem. The CGI is bad is most cases (they couldn't even take off Henry Cavil's mustache successfully), and at this point, with all the rumors that Henry Cavil is leaving the DCEU, I kind of wish they just kept Superman dead. But there are very funny moments in the movie. The Flash, for example, is hilarious in every scene he's in. Aquaman is also very funny. This is a fun movie, and it didn't meet the mark, but I accept it for what it is. So now, a year after I saw the film, I'd just consider the film to be good. But it does leave me excited for the future of the DCEU.",

The only good moments are with Aquaman and Wonder Woman. Though many have said that the scenes where the Flash goes into \"FlashTime\" are cool I think they are very stupid, considering that Ezra Miller isn't very athletic at all and the moment when he poked the sword into Wonder Woman's hands my friend and I burst out laughing at the ridiculousness of it all.

Marvel is too far ahead. But the one thing I absolutely hated about this movie was the overuse of Superman. He is not that strong! Why would I want to watch a movie that makes me think the villain is all powerful and is unstoppable just to have some idiot in a red cape giggle and defeat him. And that scene where he defeated the entire Justice League was completely unrealistic. The fight would have been over the second Wonder Woman had stepped in. Especially when the Flash stepped in. I have honestly never been more angered, upset, and disappointed by a superhero movie than with Justice League. ",

The movie's setting is on the earth. There are a lot of actors in this movie and they are big stars because of the movies they have appear on. We have big actors in this movie like Gal Gadot, Ben Affleck, Ezra Miller, J.K. Simmons, etc. Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Ezra Miller as The Flash, Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Ray Fisher as Cyborg. In the movie, everybody makes an excellent acting but Ezra Miller and Gal Gadot steal the movie with their scenes.\nThe movie is about that the world in under the menace from Steppenwolf and Batman, without Superman, has to build a team that can help him to stop Steppenwolf. \nThe story from the movie isn't the best because at almost the end of the movie, all the team us losing and Superman appears and defeat the villain very easy. So that means that it wasn't necessary to make the team.\nThe cinematography was very good because in some scenes they were on another part that wasn't the earth and they created the place so real.\nThe soundtrack was very good but it wasn't perfect. We can compare Suicide Squad soundtrack to this one and you will see the difference.\nThe best scenes were the fight scenes from the movie because they are so edited that they look real.\nThe special effects were good but the villain, that was made by CGI, wasn't perfect.\nI would give this movie 7/10.\nThe fans are going to be happy because they will see the most iconic group of superheroes on the big screens and the movie respects the essential feeling from the Justice League.\nPeople should see it because it's entertaining and if you want to have a great time you should see it.",

That being said, I really loved this movie. Everyone seems to be holding this up to Marvel, but I don't want a Marvel copycat.  I want the DCEU to be distinctly different. And it is. And what is all the complaining about the darkness? Nolan does gritty and everyone squeals, Snyder/Whedon does dark and everything is all angry and bemoaning about tone.  The idea of Affleck touching a super hero property made me cringe, but I am so glad to be wrong. He is great in the role. TBH I loved the entire cast, (with the exception of Henry's upper lip. You people built a whole body for Cyborg but you couldn't give poor Supes a better lip?!?)\nDon't believe the angry reviews,  just don't go in with your preconceived notions as blinders and try to enjoy the movie.",

Wonderwoman was amazing but the franchise was falling so flat is was becoming a thing people (me included) LOVED to hate. \n\nThis was a surprise. I liked it. I enjoyed it and there was so much more to love. All the new characters, though rough, spelled hope for the entire franchise just as Wonderwoman continues to. Even the most hated of them all, Batman, seemed to find footing in his role and start coming into his own, giving the character more places to go and a new dimension, breaking out of old tropes. \n\nWas it perfect? No. But it doesn't deserve the bad rep it's accrued from critics.",

        {
            "content": "It may have ticked a lot of boxes but felt for the most part devoid of heart. I liked it and yet felt completely underwhelmed by the final product.\n\nLet me preface this by saying I had been a fan of all entries to the DCEU. Man of Steel told the great tale of a man rejecting his heritage to save his home from annihilation. Batman V Superman: DOJ told the tale of misplaced anger and how fear can be manipulated to leave the world in more exposed place than it was before. Wonder Woman told the tale of a sheltered demi god coming to the front to save the world from death and oppression.\n\nWhat Justice League meant to do and failed to deliver was how weary outsiders can overcome the hardships in their lives and band together to save a world they are once again finding hope in.\n\nI do not lay the blame at the hands of either of the directors. Zack Snyder was hoping to realise another part of his large vision that he set up in BvS and Joss Whedon had the unenviable task of coming in to direct reshoots under really hamstringing circumstances.\nThe fault for me lies with the studio and the heads of DC films (looking your way Mr Johns). The reason I take this viewpoint is simple I think Warner Bros were too narrow minded in their thinking that the general audience looking to see this movie would not be able to handle a 2.5 hour runtime and a silly idea that every tentpole movie needs to make $1bn to be a success. It did not help either that the marketing provided to be too much of a mixed bag.\n Geoff Johns proved that he was way out of his depth with this movie. I think he was too eager to be seen the one bringing a much needed change to the style of the movie, ultimately too it's detriment. I believe he amended Chris Terrio's screenplay too much to reduce any perceived darkness and when that wasn't working to hire another writer for reshoots and ultimately when that approach did not work, to let \"fans\" throw both under the bus. The proof is in the pudding as he now no longer serves as head of DC films.\nUltimately the efforts of both of these contributing factors result in a movie that feels less like a hopeful action epic, than a $250m apology that DC can still get things right.\n\nZack Snyder for his part manages to keep some of his vision for the characters intact, albeit under restrictive conditions. Joss Whedon for his part tries his hardest to create a cohesive picture however I just believe too much was changed. Instead of meaningful arcs and good storytelling I got a cool action comedy.\n\nIn the movie you get some really cool action sequences but they are undercut by issues with pacing. A good part of it is shot very well but feels undercut by those doing the colour grading.\n\nThe short runtime means plenty of the actors are left with little or not enough to do and doesn't allow us to feel the characters the actors are working hard to flesh out.\n\nI will argue that Steppenwolf was appropriately the right villain for this movie but it felt like the whole team missed an opportunity to do more with an interesting character. Instead of a character hell bent on revenge with the potential to unleash devastation on the world we are instead left with a disgraced but powerful, snarky coward.\n\nThe movie could have benefitted from the energy of original composer Junkie XL score to add a real sense of electronic rock'n roll to proceedings. Danny Elfman does a serviceable job under the circumstances but his classic approach leaves it feeling a bit too theatrical for my liking.\n\nI mean don't get me wrong there were some parts of the movie I really liked but the story but the desire to lighten proceedings in the hopes of box office appeal really undercut the hard work of everyone working on that film that hoped to realise a grand vision.\n\nInstead of a grand chapter we were ultimately left with what felt like an extended episode of a TV series.\n\nTo Geoff Johns and Warner Bros this movie should serve as proof that pandering to \"fans\" on discussion boards can undercut your efforts, leave you lacking direction and ultimately leave true fans respecting you less.",

Affleck's Batman could have used a bit more grit he was more convincing actually in BvS but I put that more on the change in tone of the film than on Affleck.  Lastly, Wonder Woman is Wonder Woman...she kicks butt and all the men cheer.  Sadly the film doesn't have the depth (really for any of these characters) that her stand-alone title does but she already is a strong established character and nothing changes in this film with her.  \nSo good but could have been a lot better like the plot to Injustice or the hit animated show.

This review is met to summarize personal views, help movie goers decide on how to spend their time, and even help enlighten creatives with structural judgement to form into educational intake. This is not a professional review and is met to reflect on my opinion as the audience. Any opposing or agreeing views are encouraged to be expressed in their own posts to further conversations amongst movie lovers.  \n\nPLOT: Though the plot isn't the original and unique materspiece film lovers greatly anticipate, it is reasonably presented and supported to be engaging enough.\n\n\nCHARACTERS: The Flash-Batman relationship can't seem to present itself as anything but a clear attempt at a Spiderman-Ironman interaction, and this is assisted by Barry's overall personality being a straining effort to compete with Peter Parker featured in Spiderman: Homecoming. I actually do hate to compare Marvel and DC when trying to seperate the two in terms of legacy and creativity, but it's so hard to do so when it's obvious the franchises can't seem to stay away from each other, with these types of intentions being an plain example. Other fan favorites that seemed to be promising enough to get fans into theaters turned out to be water-down versions of the characters we loved and hope to see again unless the franchise continues down its current path.\n\nDIALOGUE: With some cleverly written dialogue that greatly supports certain tones when needed, the domination of forced one-liners and forgettable exchanges help crumble the already rocky film.\n\nPERFORMANCES: Though the film is filled with a talented cast, it's unclear if some of these mediocre performances were at the fault of a weak script, poor direction, or just lack of interest. The performance by Ezra Miller in particular was reasonably convincing at times, though what dominated his screen time was filled with overacting or lack of reacting.\n\n\nACTION: The fight scenes are filled with nothing spectacular or things that are unfamiliar to preceding action films. Filled with unnecessarily frequent slow-motion shots, crashing into concerte, one-liners, and WWE style combat, these battle scenes are just too unrealistic even with the acception of a being fantasy-based superhero movie. The larger battle scenes and climax especially rely too heavily on explosions and sound effects to win over viewers. Of course these things are expected for action films and can actually be effective, but the mark was missed with this film as this is a great example of giving viewers what they already know in hopes of it working again.\n\nSPECIAL EFFECTS: Throughout the film, the effects are outstanding with it's budget, time, and attention to detail being very clearly presented. The environments and surrounds throughout the film are successful in rendering thoughts of the unique and abstract world of we have associated with DC, yet some of these effects can sometimes come across as standard video game like animation. \n\nMUSIC/SCORE: Being an admirer of Danny Elfman, I especially enjoyed his work on this film which perfectly captured the mood of individual scenes, and the overall tone of the film. What's also appreciated is how the music blends swiftly with the scene and characters, with the Flash's familiar theme during some of his focused screen time being a prime example.  \n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Though this is an improvement from recent DC films that presents to fans something imaginative and engaging, it's clear that the franchise has a couple of steps to go before again reaching the legacy that it has made itself known to have. In conclusion, LEGO Batman certainly tops this one.",

I'm not sure where the overly Jew-y attack on the Christian Trinity came from, but it's there, and it's intentional. We also didn't need a Jewish Flash--nobody else mentions their religions beliefs or background (if you don't count Diana since she's her own goddess), so why did we need to focus on how Jewish and neurotic this lame Flash is? Wasn't needed, wasn't funny, was just awful. The actor would have been fine... The character would have been fine. When it comes to neurosis--show don't tell. These writers don't get that. Just pathetic--part of my low rating comes from how much I was looking forward to a really good movie, but...just stupid stacked on stupid. If you're writing dialogue, ask yourself, would anybody actually say that at that point in time (without a golden lariat making them tell the truth I mean--Jewish Flash who doesn't fight being the worst culprit.",

His arms flail about like he is trying to swim. but he doesn't have good form for a swimmer either. He's kind ND of Goofy and stupid.

The Russo's managed to introduce Spider-Man in a handful of minutes and yet this film leaves its audience with virtually no investment in any of its newcomers. The films third-act also feels rushed with many character conflicts being resolved without any explanation. The action and CGI is (for the most part) very good, as expected from the films gargantuan budget. And, as said before, the cast interactions are the best part of the film. However, the films central plot doesn't do its characters justice and leaves many conflicts and arcs incomplete with its rushed third act.",

First of all, the cgi is god awful, and it doesn't help that the movie opens up with a shot of Superman and his awful cgi chin. Secondly, all of the new characters that were introduced felt incredibly underdeveloped. Their introductions were all swift and half-assed. Third of all, there are plenty of other errors, like there's one scene where Cyborg's self defense system suddenly goes off, but there has been no indication that Cyborg ever has this ability. It's also never used again. Another one is when Wonder Woman was seen moving faster than a speeding bullet to save civilians, but then she was as slow as a regular person in during the rest of the movie. Fourth, they made Superman too strong. Superman basically defeats the main villain by himself! What's even the point of the Justice League when Superman completely dominates everybody? Not to mention that Batman was completely useless in this movie. Lastly, the plot was generic. It was basically The Avengers plot, but a lot worse. Steppenwolf's motivations are generic, his army of throw away aliens are generic (at least Infinity War's throw away army was interesting, since they were literally killing the selves to get through a force field.\n\nTL;DR:  This movie had horrible cgi, forced introductions to the new characters, continuity errors, and making Superman seem like he doesn't need the Justice League.",

Sure it had some really low lows, but its highs were high enough that overall I found myself liking the movie.  Justice League however, is more like a consistent tone of meh.  It's not that bad I guess, but nothing about it is particularly good.\nThere are things in it I did like.  The casting is all really good first of all, and when the team is together playing off of each other they are enjoyable.  A standout for me was Flash.  He's not the Flash as we've typically seen him, he's more the bright-eyed youngster of the group who's still learning his powers, but I liked him.  Affleck is still good as Batman, though not as much a standout as in BvS, and Henry Cavill finally feels like a pure good-hearted Superman in this one.  The only role that felt a little off to me was J.K. Simmons as Jim Gordon, mostly because I so identify him with angry characters I kept expecting him to chew out Batman and demand pictures of Spider-Man or something.  He does his best, but he's not in the movie much, and never given a chance to do much.\nWhat I didn't like about the movie?  Oh god...I really wanted to like this movie.  Every time a new thing would happen, I would perk up and think \"oh, I wonder how this will go?\" and then I would get mad or disappointed.  Going to Atlantis?  Oh, it looks like crap.  Introducing the villain?  Oh, he's just some bland BS.  Big action sequence?  Oh, just a bunch of CGI nonsense.  The CGI in this movie in particular is just awful.  I never felt like I was looking at anything real, it just felt like a video game cut-scene, and not even a good video game, but like a low-rent Xbox 360 game.  The story is fairly straightforward, moreso than BvS anyway, but it's just not that interesting.  It feels rushed, and because most of these characters are getting introduced in this movie it feels like the cliff notes version of a larger story.  I would say that maybe they needed more time, but I've seen animated Justice League movies that are able to introduce their characters, give them a threat, and provide a solid story in roughly 70 minutes.  Having said that, DC's animated game is killing it right now, just stick with that.\nIf this movie had come out 20 or even 10 years ago, it would have been passable.  It wouldn't have been great, but compared to the superhero game of the time it would have been considered pretty good.  Now, the bard has been raised so high, something like this just can't compete.  It has no real identity beyond playing catch up and trying to do what it thinks people want, which just gives it an identity crisis.  My rating honestly is probably a bit harsher than it should be here.  The thing is, there is stuff in this movie I did like, there were little sparks of hope and little moments where I realized they were headed in the right direction.  But the end result is just so jumbled and ugly that I really can't recommend it.  I was so consistently annoyed my whole time watching the movie.  I kept thinking it would turn around, but then something would piss me off.  A couple of brilliant moments can't make up for that.",

Also, it made me frustrated how Batman struggled to defeat one bug creature, when in reality, he's one of the most talented martial artists on the face of the earth. Seemed like he was useless, and didn't come up with any brilliant plans. Plus, Cyborg was supposed to be funny but really wasn't, and Aquaman should be a super hardcore, deadly hero, but seemed like the blonde hair orange outfit surfer dude we're used to. Wonder woman also wasn't as good as she was in her own movie. It really felt like the only good hero was the flash, who was actually funny. However, with all of this negativity from me, I am eager to see the second one, as long as they get a better villain.",

Ok, and now I'll watch \"Black Panther\" and see what's up with that one.\nI do have to add though, that this movie was 2:45h in it's original cut and WB made them recut it to 2h and you sometimes felt that there were pieces missing.

Everyone had a relationship with everyone, and you could tell that there might be potential future rifts in play, particularly with Aquaman. Cyborg, a hero I was never a fan of, was much better portrayed here.\n\nThe ode to the Flash vs Superman race at the end was classic. As was Lex Luthor losing his hair and becoming a bit more serious and less erratic than we saw in BvS. If DC keep playing it like this, the character progression will be clear to see by the next few movies.\n\nI like both DC and Marvel, and hate comparisons, but if people recall Thanos at the end of the first Avengers movie, the horrible CGI face was a far cry from the impressive, more humane version portrayed by Josh Brolin. I expect DC will have a similar future for Darkseid.\n\nI loved Smallville, but it didn't do justice to Darkseid. If the new movies can do that, I would love nothing better.",

The villain is so cartoonish that it is all but impossible to suspend disbelief long enough to find him in any way threatening.  The cast does what they can with what they've been given, but it is rarely enough to raise the film above mediocrity.  If DC is going to keep this franchise going, they need new leadership and an entirely new vision for presenting these characters and stories.

And about the opening sequence, with the children filming Superman....talk about Super-lame! Barry Allen's (the flash) jokes had my buddy laughing out loud, however for me the most i got out of his jokes were a few chuckles and a sour taste in my mouth. They tried too hard to make Barry Allen relatable with his ability to be a \"snackhole\" and eat a ton of pizza. Pizza, aha! Another aggravating factor was the fact that Batfleck just did not do it for me. Batman is not the Christian Bale version. Cold and calculating? I think not, he went into his missions without a definite plan, and relied on his instinct, and kept getting his ass beat. Not the Batman i remember. However, the movie did have redeeming qualities. Wonder Woman, aqua man , and cyborg were all done very well, and I enjoyed the characters powers and abilities. Gal gadot is so hot and I would let her freely play with my ***hole. The movie was entertaining, and the fight scenes were pretty epic. What the hell was with that janitor? Very unnecessary and forced! Batman's lair is another plus for the movie, and there seems to be a lot of water that seeps into the bat cave (aqua man must love it!). Overall, this movie is a 6.5/10, but I will not likely be watching it anytime soon or ever again! Thanks!",

I regret not going to see this in theaters. Now since I and others didn't, the franchise is in jeopardy. We CAN NOT let that happen. Ezra Miller's Flash was so enjoyable. Affleck finally played Batman correctly. Henry did his thing. They somehow managed to turn Aquaman from the cheesy fruitcake of the pond into a badass titan of the seas. Gal Gadot did her job.

The score, at times, is bad, but there are instances where it does hit on the right note. It is the complete antithesis of what I love about superheroes and a huge injustice to the league itself. This movie has failed to make me pledge my allegiance to the DCEU, which has been a failure of a franchise since day one. In agreement with OcpCommunications, just stick with the Justice League animated series from 2001 and Justice League Unlimited and avoid this pile of kryptonite shards.

The lack of proper setup for the upcoming world-ending threat leaves Bruce Wayne, jarringly and annoyingly, monologuing about \"enemies from far away\" as he assembles a group of random superhumans to fight for humanity's existence. Wonder Woman is easily the best member of the team, but the frequent sexualization of the character dilutes everything that Patty Jenkins has strongly established in her film. Danny Elfman's score is good, yet nothing special or memorable. I expected more from a film with such a huge budget and an incredibly talented cast. An injustice towards the Justice League.",

It's CGI action sequences came out from a PS2 game and storyline is almost similar to Marvel's \"The Avengers.\" It's definitely more lighter and vibrant than it's previous counterparts, but did it really need to be? Did it really have to be another Marvel clone? In order to make a successful franchise, you have to make sure it is distinguishable from the others. Not play the copy cats. Batman was truly godawful in this. It's in no way Ben Affleck's fault . It's the fault of the filmmakers and the head of the studio who doesn't seem to understand the source material that these characters have come from. Plus hiring Joss Whedon to fix the mistakes made by Zack Snyder was a bad choice. He's a decent writer, but he has a bad habit of writing force humor and creating films that seem to be made for television. I believe a reboot is in order?",

This movie was otherwise bad and really boring, even my 10 year old hated it.

What are they doing? Start over - seriously. Cut your losses and go back to standalone movies that are well done. Give us a new Batman and make a better Superman movie and keep Wonder Woman. Everyone else can go. Batman looks like a bloated mess lately, and he can't fight. Ben Affleck is an OK actor but he is way out of his range in this role. Aquaman is unlikeable on all levels. Flash was to be the comic relief and he had a few moments, but it became boring quickly. Bottom line - blow it all up except for WW and Superman and please start over - we are all begging you.",

Compared to Suicide Squad, it's a LOT better in regards to being watchable.\n3. It does end.\n\nCONS:\n1. The villain and his design were bloody atrocious. I'm sorry but if I can't remember his name HALF-WAY while I'm watching the movie and his design looks as if the ugliest monster you can think of from Dark Souls and Diablo had a baby and then turned the graphics down to PS1 quality (even saying it's PS1 quality is generous), then you know you have screwed up.\n2. The CGI made me feel almost physically sick. This movie makes Wonder Woman's CGI look comparable to the CGI in the Planet Of The Ape Reboot Trilogy. This movie makes the Scorpion King in the Mummy 2 look photo-realistic. OH, I am NOT taking that back.\n3. The tone of this movie is really, really bad. DC was trying so hard to be like marvel that in the end, it made Justice League look hilarious, in all the wrong ways. Suppressing laughter throughout the serious parts of this movie was almost impossible for me. Jokes didn't fall flat on their face in this movie because they did land... on a floor of razor sharp spikes.\n4. Aquaman and Flash are as funny as the live action Smurfs movie. If you haven't seen the live action Smurfs, don't.\n5. Superman can be better portrayed by a rock with an S carved into it. \n6. \"S\" doesn't stand for \"Hope\". But I know one word it stands for which best describes this movie.\n7. Although it's only 2 hours, it felt like more. A LOT MORE.\n8. Every character in this movie (whether good or bad) has extremely unlikeable and unrealistic behaviour. \n9. The story, the acting and the dialogue is so bad that a poorly-written fanfiction would have more to offer.\n10. I can probably come up with more but these are the ones that came on top of my head and we would be here for a while if I tried to list every last thing wrong with this movie.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\nDC's extended universe, in my eyes, has failed exponentially. Each movie get's worse and worse. Currently, there are 5 DCEU movies. 1 of which is actually good (Wonder Woman), 1 of which is OK but not brilliant(Man Of Steel) and then you have BvS, you have Suicide Squad and then you have this. DC needs to cancel the DCEU. I'm not saying they need to stop making movies entirely, what I'm saying is that they need to try going in the direction they went with before with the Dark Knight. Focus on making a good movie that can stand out on its own rather than a movie that is only there to reference and fore-shadow later movies. Hell, Wonder Woman proved they can do this really well so just go in that direction. If they take this route, it can lead to a brighter future for DC.\n\nThis movie get's an F. Hopefully my next review won't be about something as bad as this.",

            "content": "Justice League is a fun, non risky, movie with linear and easy to follow story. \nThe story goes as follows, an ancient alien conqueror called Steppenwolf visited earth a long long time ago to, well, conquer it with the help of his army of parademons and his three teraforming devices called motherboxes but was defeated by the alliance of men, atlantians and amazons. Each tribe took one of the boxes for safe guarding. Now after the death of Superman,  Steppenwolf has returned to recover his boxes and finish the job.\nFirst let's talk about the pros of the movie. Most of the cinematography is great to watch, especially when the awfully bad CGI reshoots are absent. The heroes have a fluent enough chemistry, for a first team up, and they were all portrayed adequately by their casting choices ( except for Batman and Superman, because sometimes they felt like completely different characters to BvS). The fights were very good with some good choreography when it came to wonder Woman. Flash's use of the speed force was top notch and gave his powers a certain feel we've long wanted for our scarlet speedster. Superman's resurrection was handled pretty well and his fights with and against the team were amazing. Cyborg acted both as a heroe and a plot device for the movie and his role I think was the most important next to the trinity. His CGI, contrary to common opinion, was fantastic as well as his weaponry.  And finally the backstory of Steppenwolf was shown excellently and on point, considering it was his first appearance ever on screen, and covered everything a non fan needed to know to follow the movie. His strikes when he was fighting felt powerful and you could feel how threatening he was. Especially when he was threatening and killing civilians and Amazons. \nNow about the cons. First of all, the reshoots and the CGI in them where horribly noticeable and drew you away from the consistency of the film. Speaking of consistency, the whole feel of the movie made like it wasn't a continuation of the previous instalments in the DCEU which ruined most of the backstory, in a way. Another problem of the movie was the overused humour. I know superhero movies are supposed to be fun but not necessarily funny, and certainly not when it comes to the end of the world and extinction of the human kind. Also, humour is not suitable for some characters like batman, who are sacrastic and cocky at best. Batman in BvS was an old, broken down Bruce Wayne, adrift from his moral code, all around a brutal murdering machine. But in this movie his throwing jokes, enjoys the return of superman like they were old pals and can't keep up in a fight with ONE parademon. It was disappointing at best. Aquaman on the other hand, while he was badass, he felt a bit underused. With his powers being limited only to super strength in action. His trident was used only once and in order to stop a flood( pretty basic if you ask me). The Flash was a bit irritating at times but I could get by that considering he is just a kid figuring out his powers. Steppenwolf, when his design is taken into account, I think was pretty lame. Wearing some kind of medieval armour, yeeeah what an alien look(Sarcasm).\nOverall, Justice League was a mediocre super hero movie and not as terrible as some will tell you it was. It's definitely worth watching as it is fun and fast paced in its combat sequences. What makes it feel bad for some people is the constant comparison with its elseworld counterpart, The Avengers, which was set up in a lot of previous films, so we were familiar with the characters and the villain's full backstory. Try viewing Justice League with an open mind and you'll have a fun time for sure.",

Despite strong performances from Gadot, Affleck and Momoa, the result was slightly disappointing. The CGI on Cyborg looked cheap, Ezra Miller's portrayal of Barry Allen was awkward and the directing overall needed a little more work done. DC's Arrowverse TV shows some how did the impossible by outshining the film universe on all grounds, especially Barry Allen. Ezra Miller was trying too hard to be funny, blame the script, but it wasn't working. Also, considering how popular Grant Gustin has become in the Arrowverse's version of the The Flash, i don't see why the DCEU hasn't followed the MCU's steps in the inclusion of the TV shows. In short, Ezra Miller's version of Barry Allen/The Flash can't catch up to Grant Gustin's Arrowverse version. And lastly, Superman's resurrection was predictable, so it should've happened earlier in the film, or even squeezed into the ending of Batman Vs Superman. That being said, the visuals were mostly good, the action was excellent and that Batmobile was gorgeous!",

It felt spliced together with a lot of vital mood and transition scenes missing. It's also really telling that the movie is exactly 2 hours long. This point ties back to the infamous production issues and studio meddling. It felt like a void husk of what was meant to be.\n\nThe actors themselves barely got time to breathe, and when they did have the lonely little crammed characterization scene, it looked like they struggled to work with what they got. It was sad to witness.\n\nSo, all these bare minimum parts add up to one ultimately sad end product. It's like they already committed to doing this movie, already begun production and were legally obliged to see it to the end, despite every important part of the production failing or getting ruined or meddled with. This is Sunk Cost: The Movie. I wish they'd just halt production and postpone it whatever year they'd deem necessary, but obviously it's too much to ask from an incompetent studio like WB.\n\nThis is injustice.

Ok, Thor was a bit funnier.. At leastJustice League. was a big improvement over Batman vs. Superman. I will for sure watch the next iteration of it.",

Zack Snyder or Joss Whedon's 'Justice League' is the ultimate build up to the 6 heroes coming together, 3 of which were set up, the other 3 not at all. The characters relationships work, however that's the only thing that works in this dumpster fire. Aquaman is a bland character and is very unlikable anytime he is on screen, to make up for this he makes jokes that don't land and does some 'badass' stuff, like hitting the cgi villian Steppenwolf. Batman does a complete 360 and changes from a brooding dark basically murderous vigilante to a jokey Tony Stark type figure. It doesn't help that Ben Affleck looks barely awake throughout the course of this film. Wonder Woman is just as boring and 1 dimensional as she was in 2016's 'Dawn of Justice' with only her solo movie providing any reason to care, the countless references to Steve Trevor annoyingly remind us that we could be watching a better movie. Ezra Miller's the Flash is an attempt to recreate essentially Spider-man, removing any intelligence that the character previously had, in place for a quirky, constantly messing up Flash, purely for comedic relief. Cyborg is bland and one of the few interesting characters that the movie refuses to explore. The film has awful writing with jokes that almost never land, and a plot that is so generic and straightforward that it just makes you realize the best thing about this movie. It's so straightforward and generic that you can watch it as just a dumb superhero popcorn flick. This film is unintentionally funny, and looks ugly compared to Snyder's usual beautiful style, the cgi is awful with some shots I can compare to that of the Injustice games and the main villain Steppenwolf who appears as a Playstation character. The effects are awful, references to Wonder Woman that are shoehorned in, no consistency in this cinematic universe, and a film ugly to look at. However this film is dumb-fun and feels like a Saturday morning cartoon special and I had fun watching it.",

The casting of Aquaman was spot on, and I like the large presence of Afleck as Batman. \n\n\n\nFor all the acclaim Black Panther has garnered, I don't see how that storyline was amazing or unique. There were people riding CGI Rhinos in that too, and people fighting with spears and sticks. The last battle was anti-climatic and predictable. Or Thor Ragnarok, rated by critics in the 90's, why? It was a movie you only have to watch once. Hulk has lost his edge, the big bad guy loses, giving way to a bigger bad, there is no real development of character , Loki and Thor are still doing therur brother thing.\nThe constant energy and action of Justice League was refreshing. I don't care much for the Batmobile scene at the end or every Bat signal shot in the pouring rain, but this movie \"sticks\" with you just as long as the 90% rating Spiderman Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok or Black Panther stories.",

It's not as good as \"Wonder Woman\" but it's leagues (heh) better than that piece of shit \"Batman vs Superman\"... that movie causes me pain by its mere existence. Yes, it's rampant with the same plot inconsistencies that plague nearly every superhero movie, but the ensemble worked and the film does a decent job of setting things up for what's to come in the DC Extended Universe... though its desperation to keep up with Marvel is palpable. The characters were fun, if underdeveloped, and I found all of them to be at least marginally interesting. The exception to this is the Batfleck - I guess it's a testament to how bad BvS was that he was the best thing about that movie, since he is the worst thing about this one. He needs to take a page from Lego Batman's book and learn how to lighten up already! Gal Godot brings the same tenacious spirit to Wonder Woman as she did in her solo outing, and the new recruits are all worthy additions. I liked Cyborg better than I thought I would, and Jason Momoa (sploosh!) was perfectly cast as a modernized, supercool Aquaman... though he didn't play as big of a role as I would have liked and was pretty much a non-entity in this film. But the absolute scene-stealer of this movie is Ezra Miller as The Flash... gimme more of that guy! He is definitely the best part of the movie, thanks to his impeccable comic timing and the eager energy he brings not only to the character, but to the whole team. As much as I love to see Wonder Woman finding her footing as a leader, he really is what makes this team click. The villain was decent with just the right amount of menace - formidable enough where one of our heroes could not have defeated him solo, but not too formidable that he can just squish them all into dust. He's a suitable foil for our novice heroes, it's just too bad that he looks so lame... when he shows up, it's like a cartoon wandered onto the set. Not that that is any different than the rest of the film. I get that a movie like this is going to be CGI-heavy, but damn, there is hardly any actual footage in the whole movie. To make matters worse, some of the CGI is, like, really really bad. That greenscreen... yikes. Anyway, it's over the top and silly and borrows too heavily from Marvel, but it's still a good time. Just sit back and enjoy, and don't think about it too much.",

DC is like Patrice's dumb dog who won't stop peeing on the carpet despite being taught not to a bazillion times. How can you entrust a movie that was supposedly pivotal to the foundation on your entire cinematic universe on the hands of someone who consistently produces poor movies for you? Despite the critic and fan backlash, wouldn't you learn to change and tell Zack Snyner to go do overstylized gladiator movies? Yeah, Marvel is stuck on a formula but at least it's one from which good movies come out of. Justice League is a boring mess that neither keeps you much entertained nor does anything remotely out of the box. Its attention to detail is next to zero, there is only one shot that is to my fancy mainly because the other 900 are just a swamp of CGI with no support in prodigious framing. What's more, and I have to hammer down this nail again, a hero is only as strong as its antagonist whomever or whatever that might be. A flat tyre, a business competitor or even a psychological constraint that won't allow him or her to move forward. But an antagonist like Steppenwolf is like making an inanimate chair as the movie's enemy. It isn't enough, specially in a world where every main character is invincible due to a producer's lack of balls to kill anyone important (DC isn't even brave enough not to have the last shot of BvS with dirt levitating signalling that Superman's alive. They don't know anything about suspense!). Also, the script is your husband's encounter with that hooker which will give you the ultimate reason to end your long and unloving relationship. Look, no matter what you think, you can't make a movie good when the only way you cut through scenes is by quippy one-liners that are total unnatural to actual human speech! There has to be so much more like the attention to how bits work together within a scene and within the entirety of the movie; ow characters can interact without the sole use of expositional or \"funny\" dialogue; And don't take me as a purist, I watch all of what cinema has to offer from the smallest indie to the biggest blockbuster but Justice League is the last time I said \"wait a minute, guys, DC might just learn from its mistakes and turn things around\". No, you shouldn't spend your money watching this movie and no, you shouldn't buy a ticket to the DCEU until they prove they can make above-average movies.",

Well, go watch another movie then for Christ sake! News Flash: It is a Super Hero movie! There are supposed to be a shitload of CGI in a super hero movie. Personally I enjoyed every second of the FX loaded scenes.\n\nI am quite happy to finally see a real Super Hero movie and especially to see Batman and Superman again after that utterly abysmal train wreck Batman v. Superman.\n\nI liked all the heros in this movie. The Flash was a bit silly at times but it was bearable. Gal Gadot is as hot (I had to say it) as ever as Wonder Woman. There are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone. Aquaman accidentally sitting on Wonder Woman's \"truth lasso\" was quite hilarious actually.\n\nThe SF was generally great. I really liked the explosive action scenes. The colorful tendrils that invaded the land around Steppenwolf's lair was a bit si-so though. They should have kept them just black and red at least.\nSteppenwolf himself was okay. From a distance he was pretty great but up close (and there was really too many up close scenes of him) he looked...not so great, especially when talking.\n\nThere are a couple of stupid faults of course. Usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them. Leaving the, obviously, all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when Steppenwolf grabbed it was a real low.\n\nAnyway, I really liked this movie. I do hope we get more like it.\n\nBy the way, this is obviously another movie were we see how crappy rotten tomatoes official scoring and their so called \"CRITICS\" ARE!.",

I don't know when or if the studio will learn that it's not all about VFX (hell, there was only a couple of scenes where things actually looked real) and throwing as much messy action at the audience as possible; that characters and their development -- the weight that gives a story -- actually matters, but when they do, they could start to bring together something great. 'Justice League' feels like a small step in the right direction (I'm sure that's mostly Whedon's doing), but there's still a long way to go. Perhaps there is some hope yet now that Snyder's time seems to have come to an end.",

That alone should not serve as an excuse for liking the film, but the content was well worth the price of admission. Snyder does a great job blending the different characters personas together nicely without overdoing one over the others.  The flash is hilarious and putting him along side Aquaman and Batman is perfect. I felt it was a huge step up from the mediocre BvS that failed to please most of it's audience's.

            "content": "Coming into Justice League, I really wanted to dampen my expectations. Not because I thought it was going to be bad, only because I didn't want to be disappointed. Yet when sitting in front of the big screen with my popcorn, I couldn't help but get extremely excited for what I was about to see. By the end, was I disappointed? I could not have been further away from disappointed, I was amazed at just how good it was.\n\nWe start off with Batman doing Batman things and what looks like just taking down a criminal. However this served as an introduction to the story and seeing our first parademon. I'm going to say this a lot, but I was worried about what the parademons would be like but they were designed very well. It was a great start seeing Batman climb over buildings and backflipping off a water tower to take down the criminal. It's something we have never really seen from a cinematic Batman and it was all done so well, that it was believable. If I hadn't caught myself on, I would have applauded Ben Affleck for being so agile.\n\nMoving at an excellent pace through out, the movie then gives us the reminder we need with Wonder Woman. Diana rescues a batch of hostages by quite brilliantly blocking every bullet from a machine gun and taking down all the bad guys. It reminded us of the strength of Wonder Woman but also that she is some what active in being a superhero. Of course she's not the only Amazonian left. We go back to Themyscira and see Queen Hippolyta have warriors guarding one of the mother boxes. This is when we see our first arrival of Steppenwolf (more on him later). There were some really great set pieces with the Amazonians showing their skill with the sword and bow and arrow but ultimately Steppenwolf gets the mother box and Queen Hippolyta lights the beacon. This beacon signals to Wonder Woman an invasion is coming.\n\nWonder Woman and Batman team up and agree a team needs put together, however not before we see the history of Steppenwolf trying to destroy earth before, but failing because of the Atlanteans, Amazonians and mankind teaming up. As well as an awesome cameo from a green lantern in battle, dying and their ring zipping off to find the next worthy lantern, very cool.\n\nAquaman, the Flash and Cyborg all are recruited but it isn't rushed and each character gets their character arc fleshed out. Of course a stand alone movie would have really gave each a proper origin story, but we still got enough to really understand each character. Cyborg began a little dull, but the more we understood, the more it made sense and how he's trying to understand and control with what's happening to him. Same with The Flash and how he's not a criminal analyst yet and is still trying to fully control his powers. This is shown by him being clumsy and really brings his human qualities across. This makes both characters very relatable, even though they are both superheroes.\n\nAquaman is no different as he is dealing with not feeling part of his world and not stepping up to rule Atlantis. This is also the first time we see Atlantis and underwater scenes. These were beautiful and the 'underwaterness' was very effective. The Queen Mera cameo added to Aquaman's backstory and all together, has got me very excited to see more in the Aquaman movie. Through this scene we get to see Steppenwolf steal the 2nd mother box and then Cyborg revealing he has the 3rd, this is where things get really interesting.\n\nBatman has the idea that Superman could be brought back to life using the power of the mother box. It's really interesting seeing the dynamic between Batman and Wonder Woman and the conflict between them in whether it's right to bring back Superman. The way in which they brought Superman back was very satisfying and made sense for the story. Clark not realising where he was at first and trying to come to terms with being alive again was great to watch. Fighting the Justice League, The Flash realising Superman could move at his speed, and Clark asking Batman, do you bleed, all awesome and intense scenes. Batman using Lois as his 'big weapon' was great and a payoff from the Flash dream sequence from Batman vs Superman.\n\nThe team find Steppenwolf about to destroy the world and of course save the world, with the help of Superman really proving how strong and indestructible he is. It really was great seeing the whole team fighting together and the shot of all 6 standing after defeating Steppenwolf is just a comic book dream. I can't fault any part or character of the story, all had really strong arcs and were utilised in the best possible way. Except for one, and that was the movie's villain.\n\nThe decision to have Steppenwolf as full CG was a bit of a misstep in my eyes. The face animation wasn't the best I've ever seen and although he served his purpose, even justifying bringing back Superman, there was just no real sense of threat from the world ending. There was no panic in the streets, there were no city evacuations, and for the earth being minutes away from being destroyed, the League kept it pretty under wraps. Steppenwolf is far from a good villain but he isn't an awful one, and it doesn't take away from the story and the league at all.\n\nWith the tragic circumstances surrounding the departure of Zack Snyder, Joss Whedon stepped in and shot reportedly 20% of the movie. I can honestly say the whole movie was seamlessly edited together and never at one point did it feel like 2 movies or 2 directors' vision. Yes, you could see Whedon's humour and a few scenes but it worked. Most of the humour worked, was funny and wasn't too on the nose, some didn't quite land but that was fine.\n\nThe final thing to talk about is the 2 post credits scenes which were fantastic, 1 being a jaw dropper for me. The first one was more for the fans and the Flash and Superman about to race to see who the fastest man alive is, very cool. The 2nd one however, was unreal. At first I thought we were getting some silly Lex Luther in prison talking babble scene, but then seeing Deathstroke standing on that boat, he looks incredible. With Lex saying they need to set up their own league or sorts, it sets up all sorts of possibilities for the future.\n\nDIAGNOSIS - INPATIENT CARE\n\nI absolutely loved this movie and immediately wanted to see it again. I've brought up quick points but I honestly could have wrote another 10 pages on it but I didn't want to waste half of your day. Yes, the villain is a slight issue but when is a villain not. I'd happily watch any standalone movie for any of these characters. Do not listen to Rotten Tomatoes and go see this movie, you will not be disappointed. I'm calling it, this was better than any Avengers movie.\n\n\nMATT",

Uninspiring, generic plot with some cool action scenes and extremely cheesy dialogue, which did not leave me excited for a sequel. Surprisingly, the CGI looked very lackluster in many scenes.",

            "content": "Justice League\n(2017)\n\nPlot:\nFuelled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of meta-humans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes - Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash - it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.\n\nReview:\nIf this is DC's attempt to challenge Marvel, they done a very bad job! After the poor Batman vs. Superman, I thought that the DC comics production team would have gone back to the drawing board with this movie but they made another mediocre action flick, without giving any of the superheroes any depth. They really need to take a leaf out of Marvels book, by adding loads of humour, which seemed to work in the latest Thor movie, and Deadpool. With that aside, the action scenes were pretty impressive, and it was good to see the superheroes battling together but I still was expecting more from the first DC Justice League movie. Anyway, this film sees Batman (Ben Affleck), joining forces with Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), to put together a superhero team to takedown the evil Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), who is trying to gather 3 precious artefacts that are hidden on earth. After battling in Amazon, were Wonder Woman was born, Steppenwolf manages to retrieve the first box, so there leader, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) sends a message to earth, hoping that Wonder Woman will know how much danger earth is in. After Batman tries to recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa) to create a new super group, Steppenwolf steals the second artefact from the sea, which forces Aquaman to join forces with the others. Batman then recruits the Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and they manage to find the 3rd artefact, which helps them to bring Superman back to life. Believe it or not! Anyway, with all of them on board, they put together a plan to kill Steppenwolf, who manages to steal the 3rd artefact from them but his powers are way too much for the Justice League. The storyline wouldn't have been too bad, if the characters had some form of a background, and I really didn't think that Ben Affleck played Batman that well, especially after Christopher Nolan's great interpretation of the superhero. The Flash also wasn't in the same league as Quicksilver, who has the same type of super powers, and the Cyborg and Aquaman could have been much better. Superman did show his true powers, when he was battling against his fellow team mates and Steppenwolf but I still think that the movie could have been much better if they added some decent wit. Anyway, I wasn't that impressed with the movie, and the ending, with Lex Luther and Deadshot, didn't make the next movie that promising. Average! \n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Zack Snyder, 52, who also brought you Dawn of the Dead, the great 300, Watchmen, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, Sucker Punch, the poor Man Of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. As he was resposinsible for killing of Superman in Batman v Superman, I think that he realised that he made a big mistake, which is why he came up with that ridiculous resurrection in this movie. His poor storytelling methods destroyed the Superman franchise, and I'm surprised to see that he is returning to direct another Justice League movie, after this poor attempt. Audiences usually look forward to seeing a movie about the individual super heroes but I'm not that interested in seeing a film about any of the other Justice League, except for another Wonder Woman movie as the first one was quite entertaining. It will be interesting to see how they are going to introduce the Green Lantern, who was another important superhero in the Justice League but after the terrible job that they done with the movie starring Ryan Reynolds, they really need to give that character a serious reboot. There is rumours about an Aquaman movie later on this year, along with Shazam, with Dwayne Johnson playing the villain Black Adam. Later on next year there should be another Wonder Woman movie and Suicide Squad 2, which should hopefully be better than the first movie. Batman should also be making another stand alone movie, and Justice League Dark, Batgirl, Green Lantern Corps, The Flash: Flashpoint, Justice League 2, Cyborg, Nightwing, Man Of Steel 2, Gotham City Sirens, Deadshot, Black Adam and Sandman are also on the cards to boost the DC comic book movie franchise but as it takes so long for these movies to be produced, I doubt that I'll be alive to see them all.\n\nBudget: $300million\nWorldwide Gross: $658million\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy\nCast: Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J.K. Simmons, Joe Morton, Amber Heard, Ciaran Hinds, David Thewlis and Michael EcElhatton. 5/10",

There's some moments of pure magic that rank among my favourite in superhero movies. However it's also a very simple story, as is the resolution, that doesn't feel substantial enough for a property of the calibre of the Justice League. The storied production issues and writing changes are obvious throughout, with some shockingly unfinished cgi and tonal inconsistency with some of the reshot scenes and dialogue. it's shortened runtime doesn't give the 3 new heroes enough backstory for me, and it feels like there should be generally more to this film, but it's not on screen. Despite all that though it just about makes it through without tearing at the seams and coming apart entirely. It is no worse than some other superhero films i can think of and i would say it's worth a watch. Flawed but ultimately enjoyable.\nOn a personal note, I lament what it could have been. If you're hoping for a fitting follow up to the uncompromising vision of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, you will be sorely disappointed. Take it for what it is however and you'll be able to enjoy it, hopefully.",

            "content": "So, it\u2019s the fifth film of the DC Extended Universe, immediately following from Wonder Woman and Dawn of Justice and could it be their answer to the MCU\u2019s Avengers? I do try to forget the MCU when watching these but it\u2019s impossible to not draw comparisons, especially when you can see the influence and direct competition. It does make me wonder if I would like these more if the MCU\u2019s success wasn\u2019t apparent. Batfleck is haunted by a recurring threat coupled with his guilt of contributing to the death of Superman. He\u2019s also got wind of a few other special individuals that might be able to aid his cause in defending the Earth, so he embarks on a mission to recruit Aquaman, The Flash, Cyborg and of course, the possible new favourite, Wonder Woman. Now, even with all these strong characters; the story and common enemy that brings them together is somewhat, underwhelming and pathetic. The script is totally cliched and is only forgiven because it\u2019s essentially a comic book movie. It\u2019s quite cheesy, especially in comparison to the previous movies, and there\u2019s a clear influence from the MCU with the comedy elements that actually works. It had me laughing out loud. The CGI was quite weak, looking cheap but it did make the overall film more comical with over-the-top action that\u2019s certainly up to par. I understand there was some required reshoots which must have put strain on the production, not to mention the sad and tragic change of director with Whedon stepping in to allow Snyder to grieve. I didn\u2019t know of the moustache story which the new Deadpool trailer obviously snipes that. I was watching Cavill\u2019s scenes with something bugging me about his face, especially his upper lip. It wasn\u2019t until after the film that it transpired that Cavill was requested for reshoots but had already commenced filming for Mission: Impossible, whose studio refused to have Cavill remove his facial hair, so his tash and face fur was CGI erased. It\u2019s not wholly terrible, but it\u2019s certainly noticeable. I\u2019m still not entirely sure of Batfleck, but I certainly don\u2019t dislike him as much as I was expecting. Gadot is well and truly suited to her role though Momoa doesn\u2019t quite suit Aquaman, even though he is a cool addition. There was enough Cyborg for me and he ended up feeling more like a filler as oppose to a key member of the team. The scenes he does have just reminded me of Battlestar Galattica! Flash\u2019s parts were some of my favourites, especially towards the end of the film; and again, there must be a part of the DCEU that hates on Marvel for having Quicksilver do the best action sequences before them. Miller is perfect though I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s the lovechild of Justin Long and Nathan Fillion! Now, one major criticism I have is the score, which doesn\u2019t match, and even though Elfman recycle\u2019s his own Batman theme from Tim Burton\u2019s visualisation and uses noticeable snippets from John William\u2019s Superman Theme; it sadly doesn\u2019t suit the past films of DCEU. Elfman\u2019s no stranger to superhero scores with Hellboy, Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man and of course Burton\u2019s Batman under his belt, but this was too dreamy and fantasy themed as opposed to Zimmer\u2019s darker superhero style who\u2019s currently retired from doing superhero scores. Junkie XL was first to fill the void who was then reported to being fired by Joss Whedon and replaced by Elfman; and whilst the sound mixing is brilliant, with the old themes echoing perfectly at the right times, it just doesn\u2019t gel with the rest of the films at all, pushing this to be very different from the rest of the franchise. Overall, it\u2019s a better edited film than Suicide Squad and a stronger continuation than Dawn of Justice; it\u2019s actually a lot of fun but it doesn\u2019t beat Wonder Woman and is actually quite a different film for the previous segments. Still not MCU calibre and it appears this franchise will forever be in their shadow; and sadly this hasn\u2019t restored any of my faith in the DCEU.

DC just needs to stop. They made a good one with Wonder Woman, but that's been it. Let Marvel continue to rule the verse.",

It was the third act that was a bit light on plot, but the action sequences were not as chaotic or dour as previous films, and actually had some fun moments (how much of this was Snyder, and how much was Whedon is best left to your imagination). It was a bit strange to see some supporting cast members (Martha Kent, Alfred, the Amazons) that had laready been introduced, and some that had not (Cyborg's dad, Aquaman's crew).\n\nThere's mixed acting here. I'm still not sold on Ben Affleck's Batman. Gal Godot works better as a lead than a supporting character. Henry Cavill didn't really change anything. Ezra Miller was a breath of fresh air, and Jason Momoa added a surprising amount of nuance. Ray Fisher was fine.\n\nIf DC wants to up their game, they are moving in the right direction.

I read an article on why he didn't and he said he needed someone to fill a darker roll...ok but then he filled that roll with an obviously queer actor (I am not homophobic, he is actually queer, and he has stereotypical mannerisms and look) who SUCKS at acting. He didn't bring a darker edge to the character, he brought annoyance to the audience with his bad acting, flat jokes and unrealism to that character.

I hate to compare Marvel to DC because I love both equally, but the reason why Marvel's Avengers is so successful is because we got to know most of the characters before the first Avengers movie. In Justice League, we do know Wonder Woman, Superman, and Batman relatively, however I think it would've been nice to get to see Cyborg, the Flash, and Aquaman in movies before Justice League. They don't have to have movies for themselves, but it would be nice to see them in movies with Wonder Woman, Superman, or Batman before Justice League. I believe Aquaman is actually getting his own movie however, my personal opinion is that it would've been nice for this movie to come out before Justice League. I think the reason why people have been more biased to Marvel is because they've created more of a universe than DC has. The way they have told the story and preparing for the first Avengers movie created excitement because the audience loved the previous movies and loved the characters. Whereas DC introduced us to Wonder Woman, Superman, and Batman before Justice League, however they didn't do quite as good of a job. Wonder Woman was an amazing movie, however, we can all agree Batman vs. Superman was kind of a flop. Justice League has a chance to become great, however, I don't know how they can fix this. It seems their main problem is that recently they've had movies that weren't as good. Like I said, Wonder Woman was amazing, but then there are movies like Batman vs. Superman and Suicide Squad. Batman vs. Superman was rushed and Suicide Squad was disappointing because, again, it was rushed, and the advertising was very misleading. Most of the trailers and even the movie pictures made it seem the Joker was the villain, but then it was Enchantress. Also, I honestly think they should've just given the Joker and Harley their own movie before Suicide Squad. Honestly, that would probably make way more box office money than Justice League got (which isn't saying much). Basically, I think DC hasn't take the time to tell their character's stories in better detail because they're just trying to keep up with Marvel. It just seems all of their movies lately (besides Wonder Woman) have been rushed, and that is why I didn't like them coming out with Justice League. Also, the storyline for DC doesn't flow as well as Marvel's.",

But ultimately why this movie deserves 5 stars is because after all of the BS, DC pulled off creating a movie that, on it's own would be a 9/10, but instead is the birth of a whole universe of movies. It brought together stories from movies past and provides a source for movies to come, and not just movies including the main heroes of this film.

While not a perfect movie, it is still damn good and certainly makes me happier than many Marvel movies have as of late. (Ultron the shitshow, Civil War being half a movie and half a shit show, Spiderman Homecoming looking like a complete mess...) I'll say this... I didn't like Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne at first, but when BvS came out I instantly began to enjoy his delivery of the character. It's no different here. I hope he continues to be Batman. Meanwhile, I'm absolutely in love with the Flash now and I am begging DC to make more Superman movies with Henry Cavill. That man is Superman hands down! I didn't like Aquaman, I don't think Jason Momoa is a good fit for him, but I also don't care enough to bitch about it anymore. I don't mind Wonder Woman, she's okay.

            "content": "The idea of a superhero crossover film was taboo twenty years ago. Everything was standalone and that's the way we liked it. Honestly, did we even really know that we wanted to see more than one comic book lead in a film back then. I don't remember myself, but once Marvel began spoon feeding us these tiny cameos in their after credits sequences that became films that had full fledged teams of superheroes it seems as though a hole that we had as movie audiences was filled. Everywhere we look now we get the news that some studio is planning a \"cinematic universe\" to create an entire slate of films and more importantly revenue.\nThe main competition on comic books news stands for Marvel has been DC for decades. Marvel has some iconic characters, but DC also has characters that have been a part of popular culture since the late 1930's. The thing is that the stars have never aligned to deliver a film featuring their own team called the Justice League, other than cartoons and an awful TV special back in the 1970's. They're now trying to play catch up with a definite hit or miss game plan as they enter their fourth film Justice League.\nThe film follows an intergalactic threat named Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciaran Hinds) whose objective is to find three cubes called Mother Boxes that will turn the Earth into his home world.  It's destroying to create, ala Genesis in the Star Trek II and III arc. This is a post Superman world and Batman (Ben Affleck) has decided to not be so homicidal and build a team to work together to battle evil across the globe. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) round out the Justice League as they prepare to battle the greatest threat to this world. \nThe idea of a Justice League film would have gotten me excited ten years ago. Now, not as much as it should have mainly due to the poor delivery of films such as Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (a marquee film that is a waste of stories and characters) and Suicide Squad (a film with a good concept, but no real antagonist). Wonder Woman bucked that trend with a film that is interesting and exciting, but there was still the feeling of dread when this newest DC film came to the local Cineplex. \nEven before an audience saw this film the troubled production left many without hope for how Justice League was going to turn out and the verdict is that it is nowhere near a perfect film, but it is a step in the right direction being better than BvS and SS. There isn't that dark despair that punctuated those two films and it feels more like a typical superhero film that actually takes a few beats and has some comic relief. One of my main complaints about Batman v. Superman is that there were no real breaks from the constant action and darkness of characters that were developed so many years ago. Justice League manages to get some laughs, breaking up the seriousness and tension of the film, mainly with Miller's timid portrayal of The Flash, and the general bad assery of Momoa's Aquaman. These characters are more like you would want, except for Wonder Woman who feels like she has been regulated to second fiddle in this film, a shame considering her solo film was such an exciting film.\nWhat causes the problems with Justice League lie in the story. Once again we get Steppenwolf and his collection of video game sprites for our heroes to fight throughout the film, which is something that really polluted Suicide Squad. The character is better than Enchantress, but in the end it feels like you're fighting thousands of the same thing, which has become a well dulled clich\u00e9. Then there's the Superman (Henry Cavill) issue. We all knew he was going to come back in this film after being dispatched in Suicide Squad. Sadly, it really isn't very momentous and seems a bit too easy. I know characters come back in comic books all the time, but this really doesn't gel with the rest of the film. The plus is that when Superman does work out his issues, Cavill plays the character more like we are used to instead of the brooding character that was really cutting into Batman's psyche territory.\nJustice League is a step in the right direction for the DC Extended Universe. It is an entertaining film that doesn't feel like a two and a half hour depression screening (thankfully they kept the running time at two hours). It is not close to a perfect film, but it does stand as a popcorn movie. I have had an appreciation of these characters for as long as I can remember, so they do hold a special place for me.  Hopefully they can keep going in the right direction as they move forward.",

The heroes are cool and the concept for the story was interesting, but the film felt a little heartless and at the same time, like it was trying a little too hard some of the time. The first 30 mins are so were pretty messy and the villain, Steppenwolfe was not very interesting and looked very fake. They could have invested a bit more in special effects, particularly in regards to Steppenwolfe. Hopefully, they will learn from this film and improve next time and make something as good as or better than \"Wonder Women\" in the future. Marvel has set the bar pretty high and DC needs to clean up their act to compete with Marvel and give these characters the journey and quality they deserve.

Flash seemed less melodramatic and gloomy than his television counterpart, Aquaman looked like a badass king, Cyborg was a broken, angry young adult, Wonder Woman seemed to be as powerful as ever, and Batman seemed to be the alpha dog of the JL. Oh, Warner Brothers. You misled us with the excessive Leto-Joker promo before Suicide Squad, and look what that turned out to be. Justice League seemed to be a completely fine film before Snyder left the project out of grievance (his daughter took her own life). Joss Whedon, a usually credible director, likely undid all of the ups promised. Desperate reshoots to lighten the tone to seem more like an Avengers copycat, and we can't forget the now infamous Cavill-stache. I may come off as a Snyder fanboy, but I feel like there was no need to alter this film. Snyder had a clear vision on what he was going for. I'm not saying it was going to be amazing, but it would've turned out a tad better. Marvel fans argue that DCEU is just trying their hardest to catch up to MCU by whipping up anything that'll get people in the theater. That might be true, but some of the performances contradict such. Fisher's Cyborg was an angsty character, but for good reason. He was robbed of his future. Miller gave Barry Allen heart and humor. For the few Superman scenes, Henry Cavill was more like a true superhero than ever. Sadly, Wonder Woman felt like a watered-down version of her earlier portrayals. Aquaman was alright, but wasn't as intimidating. And oh boy, Batman and Steppenwolf were BAD. Batman was the highlight of the rather disliked Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice. He felt taken straight out of the iconic Miller graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns\". This time, he felt like a not confident, wimpy departure from the almost moral-less predecessor. Steppenwolf followed the blatantly recycled superhero team-up villain formula: take over the world, for, reasons. This film really disappointed me as a huge fan of DC, on the screen and on the comic pages. 5/10",

            "content": "Justice League or part 3 of the new Superman movies wasn't bad.  Critics gave it 40% which is just wrong.  Granted, all these superhero movies and television shows are getting a little long in the tooth even for me a longtime fan of the genre.  Thanks to George Lucas and the advances at ILM with CGI we can finally recreate all the comic books of our youth in stunning visuals.  However we must remember what George warned us about, \"CGI is great but you can't forget the story.\" Paraphrasing there.  \nBack to the numbers, how is it that Wonder Woman got a 92% while Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice only got a 27%?  Ok BVS wasn't a great story and it had many flaws in the telling.  I would even go so far as to say that only by watching the director's cut can you even follow the story at all.  Justice League has a very simple story line not unlike all the latest Marvel movies that critics keep fawning over.  75% for Avengers Age of Ultron? It's the same story!!  Something is wrong here.  Critics these days are far too politically correct.  Wonder Woman was good but it wasn't so much better than Justice League and again a 92%.  Why?  Because it's a woman superhero?  I have been a fan of Wonder Woman since the old TV show with Linda Carter but I can still look at it objectively.  Yes it was a good movie but it had its flaws and the story was not great.  It makes me wonder if Disney is paying critics under the table and because Warner Brothers can't afford the extortion payments they get dinged for their movies.\nSo let me discuss the overall story line here as one movie leads to the next.\nMan of Steel:\nFirst movie in the series where we get a fresh take on the superman back story.  The back story where they were still on Krypton was the best part of the movie and added something fresh.   Ultimately Superman grows up and then helps destroy the city where Batman lives in an attempt to rid the world of his fellow Kryptonions who have come to earth to take him away so they can use his DNA to rebuild their race.  Not sure why they didn't just go off and start a new family with the people on their ship and save themselves the trouble.   Superman kills!!!!!  Oh well.\n\nBatman Vs Superman:\nIs the continuation and shows how Bruce Wane is going to kill Superman for destroying the city but before he can do that the evil and crazy Lex Luther decides that he is going to create a monster to destroy everybody.  Batman and Superman, (Now friends because they both have a mother named Martha) team up to kill the monster.  Wonder Woman also arrives out of nowhere to help fight.  Sadly Superman dies in the last moments of the battle and the movie ends with dirt vibrating on the coffin.  \nJustice League:\nI really liked the intro of this Movie where Batman is on the roof defending his beloved Gotham.  Batman is by far my favorite DC hero.  He is human with lots of money and some detective skills who dresses like a bat and beats up the bad guys.  What's not to like for an 8 year old kid?  For this rendition, Ben Affleck dons the cowl and in my opinion is one of the better Batmans of my lifetime.  He does a good job of playing the older worn out man who is still trying to save his city, one bad guy at a time.    One critic mentioned that he looked as if he didn't care or didn't want to be there but I didn't see that at all.  There was just enough humor and action to make me believe.  The batman story was far better in Justice League than it was in Batman Vs superman.   \nOverall the story goes like this.  3 large square boxes that hold great power. (Anybody else thinking Tesseract here?) are hidden throughout the world.  The moment Superman dies the mother stones begin to call out to the evil Stephen Wolf who has been away from earth for thousands of years.  He is the apocalyptic destroyer of worlds whose last attempt to destroy earth failed.  However now that Superman is dead he will easily get his revenge.  He has come to reunite the three boxes giving him the power he needs to send out huge purple worms to destroy the earth.  (Anybody thinking Ego from Guardians of the Galaxy2?)   \nWith the world at risk it's time to gather the team.  Bruce Wayne begins by running off to the frozen north to find Aquaman.    Best version of Aqaman I have ever seen by the way.  Not sure I understand his out of the water abilities and he can't talk to fish but good to know we have another strong arm on the team with a trident of power in his hands.\nFlash is next with a quick back story thrown in to tell you that his dad is in prison for killing his mother and he is trying to prove his father's innocence?  I think I would have rather had this all be a mystery and had the flash be a little less nerdy.  The Flash in the cartoon version of the Justice League is a much cooler version than this one and if you can't do the back story justice why try?\nWonder Woman.  Ok she is the best part of the movie.  Still hot and powerful and because we had the Wonder Woman story we have some good background about what she can do.\nCyborg:  The back Story on Cyborg was the weakest part of the movie.  We got a glimpse of him in the Batman vs Superman movie but other than that they do a very poor job of explaining how one of the boxes gave him his abilities and what those abilities are.  Does he have limits?  He is a lot like the Iron Man of the group.\nNot having enough power yet to take on Stephen Wolf, Batman comes up with a plan to bring Superman back to life by using one of the boxes of power.  It's a good thing that the Flash can control lightning to charge the box enough to open it so that some can come out and fall into the water of( ok I got confused here.)  Anyway Superman is blow back to life and is a zombie and after SuperZombie almost kills Batman Alfred rides in with Lois Lane to save the day.  SuperZombie will be ok now that Lois is here. But Superman flys away with her and we aren't sure if he is ever coming back.  As if.\nWell we can't wait for Superman because Stephen Wolf just stole the last box and he is flying away to Russia to end the world.  \nOk so the movie is over at this point.  Without proper build up which we never got, we never believe that Stephen Wolf even has a chance.  We are just waiting for Superman to wake up and join the fight.\nOh and it turns out that Cyborg has so many abilities that just keep changing he will be able to save the day by plugging into the Mother stones, talk to them and somehow break them apart.  Nope he needs the help of Superman to do it.  \nOverall the movie was entertaining.  I was able to stay awake which is saying something these days.\nMy previous points about back story is one of the biggest problems with Justice League and many stories these days.  The only real back stories we have for these versions of these heroes are Wonder Woman and Superman.   We have nothing for Aqaman, Flash or Cyborg and very little for this Batman so it doesn't matter how cool they are we don't know them and ultimately don't care about them.  They could have pulled a giant magic rabbit out of their costumes and destroyed Stephen Wolf with it and we would have had the same reaction to the ending of this movie that we did but it may have been funnier.  If you haven't been following the comics sadly you have no idea what these heroes are capable of.  Can they even be hurt when flash falls down does he bleed?\nWe knew from the start of the movie that there was no way that Stephen Wolf was going to destroy the world so you have to make the story good enough that you wonder if he might.\nIn this case the final battle was just the end of the movie rather than a big build up.  We are glad to say that the purple worm only got a few miles away from home base before it turned into pretty flowers. \nI waited for this movie to come out on Blue Ray because the reviews were so bad.  Sad that I let the critics influence me so much but these days it's hard to guess.  Perhaps the movie was better at home because I didn't have to listen to the crowd laughing at the sometimes stupid humor and that added some needed seriousness to it but overall the story wasn't any worse than so many other hero movies but the timing was wrong.  They should have done a flash movie a batman movie a cyborg movie and an Aquaman movie before bringing them together.   Then we would have had a great back story for everybody and this story would have had a lot more to it.  \nGood overall acting except for Superman's CGI lips that needed to go back in for some more acting lessons.\nHonestly I think we are just starting to grow tired of all these super hero movies with the same story being told over and over again.  Where is the real conflict that perhaps doesn't get resolved in 2 hours?    How many times can we watch one guy or Woman, pounding on another guy and not get tired of it?  \nWhen I was 8 It could have gone on for a long time but I am not 8 and I need better.",

            "content": "This is the biggest cinematic disappointment of my 2018 thus far.  The movie opens to Superman being filmed by a couple of kids for their blog.  due to cavill's contract with another film he could not shave off his mustache for reshoots of justice league so they had to use cgi to remove the mustache.  the result is horror incarnate.  at first i thought it was a superman imposter then when i realized this was the actual superman i stared in disbelief, mouth agape.  i wondered out loud to my wife something about first impressions being everything as i tried my hardest to \"the sphere (1998 - dustin hoffman, Samuel L. jackson, & sharon stone)\" this crap and try to forget it.  ok, i forgive this.  contract stuff can be tough, lets just hang onto judgment and watch the rest of the movie.  well it only got worse from there.  i keep seeing complaints in the reviews i read about wonder women being ogled by the camera and i definitely agree that that happened but i would argue that this was the only thing that saved the movie.  My wife absolutely despised the flash.  when did the flash turn into an aspergers afflicted 14 year old?  (my son has aspergers so I have first hand experience).  i laughed at his jokes a few times but they didn't redeem the performance.  the worst part is that i was one of the few that really enjoyed dawn of justice.  I thought affleck could be a pretty dang good batman.  i still think he can be in fact but he was not that in this film.  what they did to batman here is inexcusable.  they made it to where i couldn't care less about batman.  this made my heart break.  i thought there was something wrong with me.  batman is one of the greatest comic characters of all time and they turned him into the madam at a house of disrepute.  the glasses on his bat suite made him look like a moron.  it was the worst looking bat vehicle i can imagine.  in bvs, affleck was awesome.  in my opinion he was the perfect bruce wayne then he follows it up with this crap?  the only truly good bruce wayne moment was at the very end of the movie.  also, we have seen dark and gritty all throughout this universe dc and warner bros have constructed and then halfway through this movie they wanted to make it a marvel movie.  lighthearted and fun and witty.  complete 180 degree switch from man of steel, bvs, and 80% of wonder woman.  make up your mind.  don't listen to the fans and what they want because we have no idea what we actually want (aside from a flashpoint paradox movie, we absolutely want that).  but fans are morons 90% of the time yet this movie feels like they based the entire thing of the comment section of 4chan.  the lego batman movie was miles better than this flaming pile of excrement.  my wife didn't even like the christian bale batman until she saw this movie.  now she wants bale and nolan back. keep in mind batman has always been one of my favorite characters.  i love dc and marvel.  i loved bvs, wonder woman, and man of steel so don't just dismiss me as a hater of all things dc because i'm not.  this movie was just that bad. steppenwolf was terrible.  its like this movie had a massive budget and spent it all on cocain and strippers.  the cgi was pitful.  you can clearly tell when there is a green screen behind them.\n\nnow for the positives:  wonder woman nails it yet again.  cyborg and the close ups of gal gadot's backside were the best part of the film until we got to see superman.  the fight between our heros was pretty awesome.  i give this part of the film a 10/10 and the entire reason why i rated it a half star.  I even enjoyed aquaman for the most part.  oh wait, did he just surf on a parademon?  Yeah that ruined it.  if you're going to be dark and brooding then be dark and brooding.  this movie felt like my teacher did when i would turn my homework in after doing it 5 minutes before class.  rushed.  agonizing.  terrible.  skip it.  i know you won't if you're a true dc fan but don't say i didn't warn you.",

They very briefly go over the back story of the main villain but barely skim the surface. This leaves the viewers wondering why this character is in the story and how he relates to the superheroes. This is very different than Marvel, who has spent years laying out the background and backstory to all their characters' lives. This movie pales in comparison, leading to a very fast plot with a villain that no one has ever heard of before. They spend  3/4 of the movies just trying to get the whole team together! This movie would've been a lot better if DC has waited until the background for each individual superhero to come out in their individual movies. Overall, not a very planned out movie, but has a possibility to build and improve on in the future.",

Reason? they provide sensible storylines that u can easily relate to, understand and want to know more about. But seeing this movie just made me feel like Warner Bros are just making movies for the profit and nothing else (Duuhhh?), they don't care if anything makes sense or not. It just like saying \" Give them the hand written ticket, they won't notice\". \n\nThis movie is so disappointing to so many levels. The Batman is unsure, untrained in combat compared to Dawn of justice, has poor detective skills, easily trusts people now, Is a talkative (if u notice), not cautious of his I.D ( I mean he went to the flash as Bruce wayne), ridiculous motive and really doesn't do much in the movie. Cyborg (Who??), Oh Yeah he's just there as a robot with mixed feelings from the beginning to the end, lame dialogues, does, i'm guessing just less than 3 unimpressive hackings. Aquaman (*Sigh*), you sound cool and all but i couldn't understand your story (even when your hot girlfriend to-be tried explaining), I couldn't pinpoint your powers in the movie (is it lightning with the staff, can u control water, are u indestructable? super strength? I didn't see you talk to any starfish, I mean come on!. Wonder woman as usual doing all the lame fighting herself (At least in this movie), Lame dialogues (Can't they just take dialogues directly from comic books), \"Karl el son of Jorl el, remember who you are?\" (*sigh*) \"Don't make me do this\" (By the way she was going hit her wrists together to create a galactic orgasm but Superman grabs it and gives her \"head\"). The Flash happened to be a rookie (Yeah that's it, you know how it goes from there). And then superman (Oh God! I love Henry Cavill so much as an actor but he's not always getting superman right or the directors are lame), He comes back from the dead through a mother box that was jump started by the rookie flash in the same gue has general zords, then can't remember anything but Batman and Louis Lane (They had a three-way once). The superman i saw seemed like the one that knows what's going on but wants to play along just to enjoy being evil to prove to the rest of the guys how awesome he is, he raced with The flash at the end (which to be honest was not necessary), and errrrr...Yeah he saved the day hands down. Steppin Wolf (pointless Villain with no sensible motive).\n\nYeah, Production wise? they could have done better for an Over-hyped movie (regardless of a whatever happened with the Snyder cuts). Storyline should be able to connect the audience more. Action scenes were bad, especially with The Batman and the Flash oh and Cyborg. Warner Bros should get someone who actually reads comic for creative understanding not just to get the job done. \n\nI'm tired, i can't type anymore.??",

The only thing that saved B vs S was a surprisingly good performance by Affleck as Batman. \n\nProblem 1 with Justice League. They tried really hard to put the origin stories of Cyborg, Flash, and Aqua Man inside a single 2 hour movie. To me it was just disorganized and confusing. I think at least they should have done an Aqua Man and Flash movie first, throwing in some Cyborg back story. If I were a super Comic Nerd I would have known the back stories of everyone, but I'm not. If you want my 10 bucks, at least give me a better introduction to the Heros you want me to like.\n\nProblem 2. And this is the conclusion since I only really had these 2 problems, but to me it's a big one, so I'll do it in all caps, because it bugs the crap out of me.

            "content": "Justice League is a very underrated movie in the DCEU. Although the movie has its clear flaws, the standout characters and on screen appearance of the finest DC heroes make Justice League an enjoyable and worthwhile movie experience for anyone. The movie kicks in at just over two hours, and this is very noticeable as a lot of scenes are cut short and the transition is very choppy, especially in the first half. Warner Brothers should have let the movie have a much longer run time, as there is a lot to tell and show in this movie. There is also an obvious differentiation in the tone as well, as the movie did have two directors with different views, such as Josh Whedon's more colourful and lighter tone. Despite these noticeable and sometimes frustrating flaws, all the heroes are standouts and generate great chemistry with one another. They each have their individual moments, where we learn about who they are or where they are at in their development. This is where the run time can be a downfall, as we don't learn enough about Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg due to their stand-alone movies being scheduled for future releases. It would have been nicer to see some more of these characters origins. However, they all prove to be very likeable and relatable characters. Batman and Wonder Woman return as well, as they build on their arcs from previous DCEU films. The return of one character is also a major plus of the movie, and is finally the big screen adaptation many fans have been waiting for. The villain Steppenwolf is weak and fully CGI, and proves to be another disappointing villain in the superhero movie genre. The action makes up for many of these flaws however, particularly Steppenwolf's battle with the Amazons and the final battle with all the heroes coming together as a team. Overall, Justice League has it's obvious flaws, but they are easy to overlook with the amazing heroes and fun action sequences.",

The CGI is a mess, normally something I don't really care about, but it really takes you out of the movie. They somehow butchered Wonder Woman too, the best thing to come from DC in a long time.

Don't expect even the CGI to be able to save these heroes from this mess.\n\nREWATCH: The only thing I despise more about this than the movie itself is that truly hideous and hyper-militaristic cover of \"Come Together\"",

            "content": "\"Justice League\" has the seeds for a great movie within it, but they're caged within a merely \"good\" film. Though the writing still fails his character (and ironically it shares a lot of similarities to Tony Stark's role in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\"), Ben Affleck still comes off as a pretty solid Batman and he much more like the way I want the character to be. [However, I know it's a personal thing, but it's still weird seeing an interpretation of Batman, Miller-inspired or otherwise, using guns meant to hurt people and not just for rappelling up/down buildings; that's just me talking.] He is even better here than he was in \"BvS.\" Another great thing, obviously due to her movie's success, is that Wonder Woman is given many of the best action scenes and lines in the flick. I was also pleased that this film finally delivered the kind of Superman I have wanted, and have been waiting, to see Henry Cavill play for two movies now (even if the method for the Man of Steel's resurrection seems almost more complicated than the comics' version). The filmmaking crew gave Aquaman (Jason Momoa) some nice opportunities to show off his cool powers, but outside of what the hardest of the hardcore DC fans know about him, general audiences have no real reason to care about this character or his backstory (later to be explored in his solo movie this December). Despite Ezra Miller's and the script writers' aims to turn Barry Allen into the CW \"Flash\" show's version of Cisco Ramon, he becomes something more akin to \"The Big Bang Theory\"'s Sheldon Cooper with all of his jittery behaviors and anti-social demeanor. Still, even with that and his powers feeling very reminiscent of the Quicksilver scenes from the most recent \"X-Men\" flicks (and again, not to mention the CW show), this Flash was cool to watch on the silver screen. On the other side of things, both the reverse-engineered message of \"hope\" (compared to \"BvS\"'s dourness) and Aquaman's second-act speech [that's designed to create team tension a la \"The Avengers\" as well as push the narrative forward] feel hollow and come off as cheap sentiments. When viewers finally get to the good action and thrilling teamwork at the end, the film decides it is time to wrap up all plot threads with a whimper. My biggest critiques of the film, though, come from the story, its tone, and the half-hearted, phoned-in stabs at humor that undermines the proceedings (making one feel like he/she was watching one of my least-favorite Marvel movies, such as \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" or \"Ant Man\"), as well as the suggestively-incomplete CGI for Cyborg (who fails to leave an impression) and Steppenwolf; I assume both of these problems are possibly symptomatic of a larger issue (re: easy-to-fix minor nits growing into bigger concerns for the film as sacrifices for the movie to meet its release-date deadline). I was also HIGHLY disappointed in Amy Adams' Lois Lane being placed in such a limited role that she might as well have been written out of the plot. Overall, the film is watchable and thrilling enough and far from the dumpster-fire that numerous critics have claimed it is, but DC kneecapping its own product keeps it from achieving true greatness.",

At the end superman pretty much did everything, he beat the baddie, he saved civilians etc. The only character that had a fairly big input was cyborg who split the cubes (but then superman finished the job on that too). It\u2019s annoying - Wonder Woman should be a real match for superman, but he beat her easily! He\u2019s as fast as the Flash too. Let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s probably a pretty good swimmer. I think it would be far better if they had brought superman back earlier in the film, and each member of the league had an input in defeating the bad guy that superman absolutely couldn\u2019t match. If he can match it - and beat it - then what\u2019s the point of the league?? Oh - and as a last point, it was rubbish that he beat up batman so badly. The film played way too much on the fact batman doesn\u2019t have powers. Yes, we know that. What makes him a great character though is he ALWAYS has great gadgets that make up for the lack of superhero strength. He should have had some to hand and put up a bit of a fight at least.",

Have their heroes develop in their own movies before uniting them, or hiring Josh Whedon from the very beginning.\nDC and Warner Bros need to stop playing games with the DCU.

And that's just the truth. They just can't compete. This is DC's \"Avengers\" movie and it's a flop. It's very sad actually. It's such a downer as a Batman and Superman fan that this is the best they can do. I would say at this point they should stop making any more movies. It's time to scrap the whole thing. Maybe reboot the whole thing in 5 years with better actors, directors, and scripts. \n\nWhat they should have done was make the whole movie about trying to stop a confused Superman because he's gone \"Bizarro\".",

I did my best not to read or see anything about those two movies going in, other than the occasional headlines about how critics hated them, so I had low expectations going in. I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw those two movies. When I saw the low reviews for this film, I assumed they were just a bunch of trolls who just hate everything Jack Snyder does, and I had high hopes. They were not wrong. This movie was bad. The \"funny quips\" are lame, the CGI villain looks terrible, and the story just had no flow to it. It's been a while since I've seen a movie where I was just hoping the next thing I would see would be the ending credits next. The Superman story-line seemed rushed, and wtf was up with Amy Adam's reaction to finding out her bf Supes was just resurrected from the dead? No surprise? No, \"Holy sh*t, Commissioner Jonah Jameson! You really weren't lying when you picked me up, and said you had just brought my love interest back to life!\" Nobody's emotions or reactions were lining up with what was going on around them, except maybe Cyborg- who spends half of his screen-time being moody about what was done to him. But after a while, maybe brush that chip off your shoulder and accept it? I'm also taking a beef at the extras in this story who were super annoying, beginning with the kids talking to Superman on the camcorder, but using cutesy toddler-talk that seemed to belong in a Pixar film and ending with the Russian family that simply did not belong in this film. If you want to see how by-standards should be filmed, check out the montages in MOS and BVS where Superman is rescuing people. They don't need ten minutes of film-time devoted to them so that we can see them cowering in fear, and we don't need their backstory. They are basically props- and your super-heroes (and Batflic) should always be the main focus. Even the burglar that Batflic runs into on the roof has dialogue that did not make sense. You get caught robbing a place, Batman kicks your butt, he then fights a flying insect man, it explodes, and then you're just going to casually make conversation with Batman like you two are best bros? The movie also throws out so many expositional dialogue dumps at you that you feel like you are watching the product child of the Lord of the Rings and DC Comics.  \"Quick, light the ancient warning fire.\" Overall, this movie was just bad. I read, afterwards, that the directors were replaced and a good portion of the movie was reshot, and I also read that the movie studio wanted a lighter movie, so that may play a hand in it. There was even snippets of the old Batman and Superman music themes, which I see a lot of reviewers liked, but I found it distracting and further takes you out of the fantasy that the movie was trying to create. Keep going this route and you guys are going to lighten this movie to the point where you'll be in Batman and Robin or Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer territory. Just an overall tragedy. I think I'll wait and rent the next one instead of buying it on its first day of digital release.",

            "content": "So this was it, the main event, the big one to rival Marvels 'The Avengers'. Only five movies in and DC (along with Warner Bros.) felt it would be a shrewd decision to whack out their superhero team-up flick, hmmm.\n\nThis was always gonna be a hard sell with the performance of previous DC movies. Superman hadn't really set the world alight and the Suicide Squad was a nice idea that was badly executed. Wonder Woman of course did well (boosted by a political agenda) but that now seems like a flute more than anything. We hadn't had any stand alone movies for Flash, Cyborg or Aquaman up to this point, something that just felt totally wrong. So not only was this a sequel of sorts to the previous Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman offerings, it was also a slight origins kick off for Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman (despite previous cameos).\n\nAlas the plot is anything but fresh (its a superhero flick). A long long long long time ago on Earth, the evil supervillain Steppenwolf (stupid name) tried to take over the planet using three gizmos called Mother Boxes. He was beaten back by a whole team of other superhero types and said Boxes were hidden on Earth (if you wanna protect Earth, why not hide them elsewhere? Like in the far flung reaches of the universe). Much later in the present day the Boxes are triggered by the death of Superman? Or the presence of Superman? Are these things sentient beings? I have no friggin' clue but they activate and this gets Steppenwolf's attention. So he comes back to find the Boxes and try to take over the Earth to please his master Darkseid. Why he didn't just do this before I dunno, don't delve too deeply into this plot.\n\nEnter our team of heroes, the Justice League. First up its good old Batman (Ben Affleck), the leader who's super power is being very rich (his own words). Alas this comment really hits home because his presence is really kinda stupid. Why would you need a regular human dressed in bat armour in a fight with super powered aliens and metahumans? He provides them with some cool vehicles...which they don't need, umm...he also lets them kip at his place? Unfortunately Affleck also seemed to not care about this movie seeing as he clearly didn't wanna be there, and he looked tubby. When he takes off his batsuit the shirt he has on underneath also has a muscle structure built into it. Methinks they had to cover his actual physique.\n\nThen we have Supes (Henry Cavill) who is basically the same as before. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) who essentially struts around making smartass comments all the time. Apparently the success of Gadot's only movie has gone to her head because my God does she act smug for the whole time. The Flash (Erza Miller) is the obligatory comic relief which is enjoyable for what its worth but is at odds with the movies tone. Also where did he get that Nasa material to build his suit? Next up is Cyborg (Ray Fisher) who is another character that doesn't really fit here. Like what does this guy do? He's basically an agile Terminator, but it seems like he could be easily destroyed at any point. And lastly there is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), the final pointless character here unless you're fighting underwater. But wait, Aquaman seems to have powers on land in this movie too because plot necessities.\n\nOne problem I had with this movie were the effects and general look of everything. Firstly its that same old drab, metallic, dark, shadowy atmosphere that DC (via Zack Snyder) has been pushing this whole time. The movie looks awful, the colour palette is terrible, and it all looks the same. Naturally there is abundance of CGI which is to be expected but again its poor and obvious looking, whilst having that strange DC/WB videogame-esque look to it. Did I mention the greenscreen? Oh my God it was horrendous and so very very obvious. The battle between Steppenwolf's army and the Earth defenders at the start was horribly dated looking. Almost all underwater sequences looked bad plus you couldn't really make much out. Steppenwolf himself looked like a character out of a [i]Mortal Kombat[/i] movie. And Cyborg was quite jokey looking at times, he looked like he was made out of tinfoil with a bad face job.\n\nI think the epitome of dross in this movie came when Aquaman surfed on a parademon whilst falling from a great height. He then crashes into a high-rise building, smashes all the way through it from top to bottom, and comes out surfing at the bottom with a grin on his face. This was literally cringeworthy cartoon garbage that also looked shit.\n\nThe other main problem here was the entire movie simply being cheap. As in using dated tropes and cliches whilst being just plain stupid. Thing is this was somewhat expected with the characters you're dealing with. Aquaman, he's useless, he merely pops up to do stuff that involves water because he's the water guy. Oh everyone's about to be drowned by a huge tidal wave!! Enter Aquaman...hurray! Oh we need someone to hack into this computer control panel thingy and do some hi-tech computer type stuff? Enter Cyborg because he's the robot guy. Oh we need someone to get somewhere really quickly or rescue some people in the nick of time? Enter Flash because he's the fast guy. Batman turns up to every battle in some yuge mechanical battle vehicle (because otherwise he's useless)...and it gets wrecked instantly. Batman loses a lot of gear in this flick. Wonder Woman strolls out of every battle without even her lipstick being smudged, ugh!\n\nThe acting was pretty dreadful across the board (except for Gal Gadot of course, because you can't say anything negative about her now). As said Affleck was clearly uninterested, Fisher swaggered as much as he could but was still awful, Momoa had big muscles and lots of hair, whilst the character of Steppenwolf was basically a live action pantomime. Of course there were numerous other characters throughout offering other actors a crack but its all cameo stuff really. A too many cooks situation basically, heck whilst the big finale battle was going down humanity was represented by one small family, probably because they literally couldn't fit anymore people in.\n\nAll in all I really struggled to find anything positive in this movie. The small sequence where the team brings Supes back from the dead was quite enjoyable. It was fun watching Superman knock the team around; I especially liked the eerie moment Supes spies Flash whilst he's zooming in his superhuman speed zone. Although, I'm not really sure why Supes would fight the team after his resurrection. OK he's understandably disorientated but why does he see the others as threats? The opening Batman sequence was also nice and harked back to earlier Batman movies in tone and visuals. Twas also lovely to hear a very short burst of Danny Elfman's Batman 89 score in one scene. It was literally a few seconds but even that was enough to really swell the scene in terms of awesomeness and nostalgia.\n\nThat's virtually it! That's pretty much the only bits in the movie that I genuinely liked. The rest of this effort felt very much like (ironically) a Joel Schumacher movie. Yes it is indeed that bad. The entire movie generally looks poor, the effects are very suspect at times (Cyborg), the greenscreen is some of the worst I've seen for some time, and the plot is generic as fuck. Add to that the even more generic villain Steppenwolf with his hordes of flying goggle wearing goblins, and a finale that was possibly the biggest anticlimax in years (considering the content we're dealing with here). And even now I still can't help but think Superman could of done this all on his own. Why is Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg and Aquaman even here?? Flash was probably the only other genuinely useful person. This really felt like bad a movie from the mid 90's. The bottom line, its ugly, dull and unbelievably uninspired.",

You are sucking on the nut sack of anything that has Marvel connected but then take DC movies that are of equal or better quality and shred them to pieces over the most obscure things. You aren't critics. You're trend followers. You don't have any self created thoughts in your heads, just take what you think people want and say it. This movie is just as good if not better than the first Avengers (which also had a huge amount of plot holes and continuity issues) but you all can't accept that someone else can make a hero film that doesn't follow the Marvel mold.",

I could go on, but what's the point? Even though this thing bombed harder than World War II, I guess it reached the right fanboy people who were already guaranteed to love it anyway. It's how a non-movie like \"Suicide Squad\" still managed to draw unwitting DC fans. It's just pathetic when compared to Marvel's amazingly consistent popular and critical successes. DC doesn't know what it's doing. Literally. Just look at what they did to their best hero here: Batman, the dark knight, made a completely uncharacteristic one-liner or quip in every other scene he was in. This, despite how he came off in the other films in this doomed franchise. They obviously don't care about their audience, so why should their audience care about them? Just a really, very bad movie, and a total humiliation when compared to the rock-solid competition. Marvel Studios couldn't make a flop if they tried right now. They're on one of the most unbelievable hot streaks in the history of popular entertainment. That'll end, as all things do, but they'll leave a legacy of at least a dozen great blockbuster movies in a row. And they just keep going. As I write this rambling, incoherent review, that new one they've got coming out-\"Black Panther?\" It's getting some of the strongest reviews for a superhero movie ever. It must be a sorry, humbling time for DC fans. I'm sorry, guys. I don't know what's wrong with the filmmakers either. It's a humiliatingly uneven playing field. DC can't reach the shoelaces of its rival, who just make much better and more popular movies than they do. Maybe one day that'll change, and some effort or intelligence will come in. I hope it will. Nobody WANTS to hate a film. I have to believe that. Maybe next time. Sorry DC fanboys. It's rough, I know.",

            "content": "My LATE, LATE, Justice League Review (SPOLIER-FREE) \n\nPROS:\n1. The character designs were good (ONLY when it came to the heroes) Not mind-blowing but not bad either.\n2. Compared to Suicide Squad, it's a LOT better in regards to being watchable.\n3. It does end.\n\nCONS:\n1. The villain and his design were bloody atrocious. I'm sorry but if I can't remember his name HALF-WAY while I'm watching the movie and his design looks as if the ugliest monster you can think of from Dark Souls and Diablo had a baby and then turned the graphics down to PS1 quality (even saying it's PS1 quality   is generous), then you know you have screwed up.\n2. The CGI made me feel almost physically sick. This movie makes Wonder Woman's CGI look comparable to the CGI in the Planet Of The Ape Reboot Trilogy. This movie makes the Scorpion King in the Mummy 2 look photo-realistic. OH, I am NOT taking that back.\n3. The tone of this movie is really, really bad. DC was trying so hard to be like marvel that in the end, it made Justice League look hilarious, in all the wrong ways. Suppressing laughter throughout the serious parts of this movie was almost impossible for me. Jokes didn't fall flat on their face in this movie because they did land... on a floor of razor sharp spikes.\n4. Aquaman and Flash are as funny as the live action Smurfs movie. If you haven't seen the live action Smurfs, don't.\n5. Superman can be better portrayed by a rock with an S carved into it. \n6. \"S\" doesn't stand for \"Hope\". But I know one word it stands for which best describes this movie.\n7. Although it's only 2 hours, it felt like more. A LOT MORE.\n8. Every character in this movie (whether good or bad) has extremely unlikeable and unrealistic behaviour. \n9. The story, the acting and the dialogue is so bad that a poorly-written fanfiction would have more to offer.\n10. I can probably come up with more but these are the ones that came on top of my head and we would be here for a while if I tried to list every last thing wrong with this movie.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\nDC's extended universe, in my eyes, has failed exponentially. Each movie get's worse and worse. Currently, there are 5 DCEU movies. 1 of which is actually good (Wonder Woman), 1 of which is OK but not brilliant(Man Of Steel) and then you have BvS, you have Suicide Squad and then you have this. DC needs to cancel the DCEU. I'm not saying they need to stop making movies entirely, what I'm saying is that they need to try going in the direction they went with before with the Dark Knight. Focus on making a good movie that can stand out on its own rather than a movie that is only there to reference and fore-shadow later movies. Hell, Wonder Woman proved they can do this really well so just go in that direction. If they take this route, it can lead to a brighter future for DC.\n\nThis movie get's an F. Hopefully my next review won't be about something as bad as this.",

The story is neither particularly coherent nor interesting and Supie's return kinda meh.

Underdeveloped characters, a plot that is inconsistent, muddled and all over the place and a villain who is like Fan4stic's Doctor Doom-levels of bad but better by a slight margin. But nevertheless, I ultimately have to commend that this film showed Synder learning from his mistakes and improving on his mishaps, provided that the studio had not stepped in and ruined EVERYTHING.

It's been a rough road for DC, with all but one of the movies being either panned by critics, or receiving mixed reviews.  After a complicated production process, the final product is quite the mixed bag.  First, the good.  The league works well together, and they all develop quite well.  Batman and Aquaman learn to work in a group, Wonder Woman is still the strong leader she was, and the Flash is a good comic relief.  That chemistry between the group is vital, as the movie could not possibly be good in the slightest without it.  And, to the movie's credit, they handle this quite well.  The Flash was surprising, and the movie managed to give him a backstory and character development.  Aquaman looked and fought cool, but wasn't as interesting a character as he could have been.  Batman was much better in this movie than he was in BvS, and they at least tried to redeem him from his portrayal in BvS.  If you think he's going to be as good as he was in the Nolan trilogy, don't.  Jeremy Irons is also a great Alfred.  Wonder Woman may not be as good as she was in her solo movie, but the way she and the Amazons connect to the overall story is very interesting.  And, the bad.  Steppenwolf was one lame villain.  He's remarkably generic, seeking the Mother Boxes to destroy the world.  And the fight scenes with him, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman appear to be recycled.  His lack of clear motivation is also a problem.  Yes, there is apparently a deleted scene with Darkseid in it, but that really should have been in it to begin with.  Even if it's exactly like the Thanos scene in The Avengers, it would have made the movie as a whole better than if they dropped it.  Cyborg is all edgy and brooding.  While that is understandable, given his situation, it just feels like the same crap we saw in the previous DCEU movies.  Still, his presence here also means we'll probably never see a proper Teen Titans movie.  Superman's return, even ignoring its predictability, was extremely cringeworthy.  Also, it teases Green Lantern, but he doesn't appear outside of flashbacks.  That's not cool.  Given the internal issues there were at DC, you can pick this movie apart and see \"the Zack Snyder parts\" and \"the Joss Whedon parts.\"  It's quite evident who would have done it better.  The future of the DCEU has been questioned lately, as Justice League didn't do nearly as expected at the box office.  DC absolutely needs to turn things around in their next few films if they want this franchise to be successful.",

But I don;t say that in hate of the film or to suggest its well below it. That's not true at all. The movie just has some weak moments with characters. I didn't care for Flash's humor and Aquaman was just weird. His rhythms were too mid-western to be some guy who came from another civilization under sea.

The interaction between the members provides light hearted humor Aquaman being central to this (as evident to the wonderfull scene in which he sits on Wonder Womans lasso of truth). Without this, the thin plot would not be able to hold up.   \n\nThe CGI of Henry Cavills mustache certainly is laughably if not downright embarrassing. Steppenwolf, played by Ciaran Hinds, has to be the weakest characterof this movi,e if not in the entire DCEU, which is saying something (I'm looking at Jesse Eisenberg in BvS).\n\nThe DCEU may have taken a step back with this one, but it still has hope for progress in the near future.

I don't know why they couldn't use an actual actor for that role with motion capture tech than full CGI, because he looked very bad. His movements were slow and It made me feel like i'm watching a CGI villain while i was watching the movie. Which is pretty bad when the audience feel that way about a character while still watching the movie. The humor in the movie was not great either. I loved my dark broody Batman in BvS and this movie had completely changed his character without giving any reasons as to why.\n\nThen the mustache. I think the only reason why i notice it was because i knew about it before going to see the movie. But i couldn't help myself. I found myself trying to figure out which scenes were digitally altered. And it was pretty obvious when you try to find it.\n\nAlso the movie was awfully short. I feel like there's a lot of important scenes lying on the cutting room floor for this movie.\n\n DCEU or rather WB has finally sank the ship.

It is too much for just one hero, so a team must be assembled to protect the world.  A league, if you will.  I have not been shy about how I have felt about DC on the whole.  I think they've been rushing into things with out fully realizing core concepts, and their movies, for the most part, have suffered for it.  You can't really blame them, as they've been trying to catch up to Marvel for about half a decade now, and their luck appears to finally be turning around, especially after the critical and financial success of Wonder Woman.  Make no mistake: Justice League has its fair share of problems, and I am sure I could nitpick this movie to death.  That said, the things I like about this, I really like, and I had a good time watching this, which is more I can say about Batman v Superman.  The biggest improvement in this came from a tragedy.  DC brought in veteran director Joss Whedon to step in and help out when Zack Snyder had to step away to be with his family for personal reasons (plenty of other sites have covered this, I'm not going to go into details for the sake of flow for this review).  This isn't Whedon's first rodeo; he directed The Avengers, and he knows how to do exactly what DC so desperately wants to accomplish.  Whedon's touches really shine through in the form of punch up dialogue, and there are actually fun moments to this, which is something that can't be said for Snyder's other DC offerings.  A lot of this also comes from Ezra Miller as the Flash.  He's extremely excited to be a superhero both as a character and as an actor, and it really helps the audience by serving as a connection point.  He also geeks out just being in the presence of other superheroes, which makes for a nice mirthful touch.  All of the new characters work well together (I'm including Wonder Woman in this camp as well), and then it kind of hit me: I want to see a Justice League movie without Batman and Superman, even though they aren't bad here.  I mean really, they make the stories feel so drab and overly serious, don't you think it would be an improvement at this point?  Like I said, there are loads of problems otherwise.  The villain is probably the most generic one in the universe if not in superhero movies in general, and his hive underlings are just cannon fodder for action sequences.  You don't care about the origin stories of the new people because they are so glossed over; they should have had their own introduction movie to get you invested, but that is neither here nor there at this point.  Also, a lot of the tension in the first half of this is undercut by the fact that you know where this is going to end up; you know these guys are all going to wind up fighting along side each other, why not just cut to the chase?  Still, the visuals look pretty good for the most part when it isn't too heavy on the CGI, and the chemistry is there.  There is a big question that DC needs to field: where do they go next?  I personally think they should pull back instead of going bigger and make smaller movies.  It would be paving the road for success in the future.",

It has a promising start, introducing a fearsome villain. But as the plot goes on, the story is reduced to the maxim lazyness and simplicity becoming in a desnecessary waste of money and time, because of its weak script and lack of originality when compared to the great Marvel movies that have been produced recently. The most stupid part of the movie, was when the villain is defeating all of his opponents, and suddenly Superman appears and destroys it with all the comodity of this world, giving the image that the other heroes are weak and dispensable without him. Could this have been more cliched? I don't think so. So disappointed.",

            "content": "After the enjoyable Wonder Woman I was hoping that the DCEU had turned a corner and that it was finally going to prove to be worthy competition for the MCU. Unfortunately that hasn't proven to be the case.\n\nStarting with the positives (of which there are few), Gal Gadot continues to be decent in the role of Wonder Woman whilst Jason Mamoa shows promise as Aquaman (although he is underused). There are also a couple of good action sequences, those being Steppenwolf's attack on the Amazon's and the mid-film fight between Steppenwolf and the League.\n\nAs for the negatives, Ben Affleck goes through the film looking like he wants to be doing something else, Ezra Miller makes for an irritating Flash and Ray Fisher is rather dull and wooden as Cyborg, a character who feels like he's only there to make up the numbers. Amy Adams continues to feel badly miscast as Lois Lane and lacks any chemistry with Henry Cavill who continues to give a rather deadpan version of Superman. Steppenwolf also makes for an incredibly bad villain. There's absolutely no development given to his character so instead of feeling like a genuine threat to the planet, he just becomes another throwaway villain of the week, a problem that has been present in all recent DC films with the exception of Man of Steel.\n\nThe plot is as basic as you can get, and on top of that, incredibly dumb. It centres around Steppenwolf trying to collect three Motherboxes in order to be able to transform the earth into a replica of his homeland. If this was a standard superhero origin film than I could probably put something as unimaginative as this but for a film that should be the DCEU's biggest event to date, I expect an awful lot more. And I certainly don't expect to see something as dumb as the League leaving the Motherbox that they had just collected totally unguarded for Steppenwolf to beam down and collect. It's writing at it's most stupid and it's hard to believe that this could make it into such a big film. That is the worst offending moment, but along with the dreadful attempts at comedy, there are several moments that will just leave you with your head in hand in disbelief at the sheer stupidity of the film.\n\nFinally, we have the CGI. Much has been made of the dreadful efforts made at removing Henry Cavill's moustache and it is fair to say that it looks laughably bad. Sadly that isn't the only poor use of CGI throughout this film. Cyborg looks awful and really stands out as being GI heavy, as does Steppenwolf. All of the action sequences are also littered with shoddy effects, most notably the final sequence which keeps up the DCEU's trend of having a final battle that is nothing more than a poorly orchestrated CGI mess. It's shocking to think that a film that cost $300m looks this bad.\n\nJustice League is marginally better than Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad but it's still an awful film. If Warner Bros want the DCEU to survive then they really need to go away and have a look at who they are employing to write and direct their films as Wonder Woman aside, it just hasn't been acceptable so far.",

The whole superman aspect felt cheesy and corny almost going back to the old way of superherodom but to me they still haven't found the right superman though he is close. Flash was a pretty solid match, a young boy scared to jump into the action and he's a pretty good combo of funny and dorky. I didn't mind Ben Affleck so much in this one, though they made him way too vulnerable for Batman and that's far from what he is. Wonder woman is a solid match. Cyborg was very well matched. However aquaman is .6 of the star missing from the 5 star rating. He was way too cocky, and corny. Not to mention the last battle felt rushed or overlooked, that's the .4. Go see it though, it's worth the watch, its the first time in a while I've been excited to see what's next.

Just like the previous movie they put too much in a movie and tried to catch up to Marvel in one film, instead of building up their own universe over a period of years.

There are multiple moments in the movie where it was obvious they cut out scenes, and the tones of the two different directors didn't always match. But I ended up liking this movie more than any of the 3 MCU movies that came out in 2017. The main highlight of this film are the heroes themselves. Their interactions with one another, their inner conflicts, and yes-we finally do see them inspire hope. I can't wait to own this movie on DVD.",

The introduction of the new Justice League characters is fairly well-done and opens the door to start exploring more of the DC Universe.  And all of the actors give pretty solid performances; except for Ezra Miller, who doesn't seem to have a handle on his character (Barry Allen/Flash).

She is gorgeous and she looks amazing as Wonder Woman. The movie is scripted well but viewers need something good/worthy for all these superheros to go for a war all together.\n\nJason Momoa as Aquaman appears cool and his appearance will go trendsetter styling now, specially Tattoos and the long haired and beard. The performances are average but Batman and Superman characters will be again loved by kids. Cyborg and Flash have played with heart and dedication.\n\nThe slo-mo combat sequence between Superman versus Cyborg, Flash, Aquaman, Wonder Woman have been cinematographed excellently.\n\nThe movie is worth a watch in theaters near you. I know it is near to impossible but viewers and fans would love to see \"Justice League VS Avengers\".",
