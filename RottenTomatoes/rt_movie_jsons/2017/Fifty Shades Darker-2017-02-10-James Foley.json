            "content": "50 Shades Darker es un upgrade de la primera parte. Te puede gustar o no el cómo los personajes se desarrollan, si la relación es tóxica o no, pero no se puede negar que al igual que la primera parte estas películas son una obra técnica, la banda sonora impartida por el legendario Danny Elfman es increíble, con canciones que realmente logran crean una esencia en la película, que al igual que la primera pasaron a ser un hit, ahora mayormente creadas por Zayn, o por la gran fotografía de John Schwartzman, el hombre ha trabajado en obras maestras como 'The Rock' o 'Pearl Harbor', y se puede notar en la película, digo hay secuencias fantásticas, que desde lo visual son increíblemente buenas. Ese plus en traer a gente súper talentosa para una primicia sencilla dan cómo resultado montajes increíbles que son una pena que sean dedicados para esta película. El mensaje de esta película para mi esta en creer en la 2 oportunidad de los demás, el realmente creer en el cambio de una persona si te importa, se pudo ver desde ambas perspectivas y me parece que para el planeamiento tan superficial o simplista que transmite la película funciona, que no está mal, sabemos a lo que vamos, el ver una trama sencilla en la que todos son lo máximo y en enfrentarse a problemas de pareja mientras se ven fabulosos, en el cuál me gustó el desarrollo, nos presentan a una Anna empoderada que ya no necesita de Christian aunque él si necesite de ella porque encontró algo más que en lo que creía que estaba establecido el amor desde su POV, ese cambio de \"roles\" me gustó y me parece que ayudo al dinamismo de la trama. Al igual que con la anterior hay clichés que \"funcionan\" para dar avance a la trama cómo el un poco innecesario trasfondo de Christian para que empaticemos con el, o como con el jefe malote de Ana, para crear un conflicto en el que ambos pudieran progresar en su propio desarrollo en la trama. Yo creo que si sabemos ver esta películas cómo entretenimiento son buenas, hay un mensaje de empoderamiento de ambos lados en el cual no está mal cambiar si la otra persona te interesa pero sin traicionar quién eres, esta película cuenta con una trama que hemos visto más de 100 veces en Netflix, pero con una calidad sobresaliente a lo que estamos acostumbrados de ver en cintas de este género.",

El guion de esta película no es nada bueno (solo es más de lo mismo), como el trabajo del nuevo director que no captura el tono correcto para una película seriamente incompetente que se podría interpretar mejor como un proyecto de suspenso psicológico y de terror que como un drama.

Especially once you learn about his background and fears of  getting attached to anyone. His inability to differentiate violence from love was realistic and extremely sad. I also love Dakota Johnsons sweet, innocent and gentle wittiness.\nShe was cast perfectly for the role of Heroine. The couple was depicted night and day different yet complimented each other in every way.\n Aside from the unnecessary nudity I found their romance simply moving and beautiful. \nIm not ashamed to admit I cried like a Sap during the proposal scene in part 2. All in all it came together as a beautiful love story with lots of extra cheesy moments I fell for hook, line and sinker and perhaps a few added cable ties, Duck tape and Rope...

This movie even more so feels like a series of boring plot points that never quite come together in any way shape or form. I don't see how this movie can be entertaining for anyone, I felt bored out of my mind getting through it. Overall, it is another baffling movie that exercised my patience and features everything I hated about the first but much worse.

            "content": "What a letdown...but funny in the worst way?\nI saw it and yeah...I had fun, laughing I guess? For anyone who tells me that its a beautiful, love story...f*ck off. It was the cheesiest, corniest, most awkward-comedic film. But hey, it worked for a great comedy where the jokes on the film. Seriously, the scenes were so bad you couldn't help but laugh. I think FSoG was better in the aspect to take it a bit more \"serious\" than FSD. This film completely did not give a f*ck, I was disappointed that the plots and other characters (Mrs. Robinson, Jack Hyde, Leila) were weak! It had potential to explore more of these arcs, but it didn't. It was dull and so rushed! Everything was rushed. Even the sex! I'm not expecting full-blown porn but cut the soundtrack songs out, more positions (not just mostly missionary all the time), and please bring in some foreplay. How can a movie about risqué intimacy not show good foreplay? Why does Christian always have an un-emotional face while having sex? No climax either? In the books, wasn't he always grinning (or proudly smiling) for his accomplishment in giving Ana orgasms? For getting off too? None of that...it cuts straight to the next scene. Man...and why was it so Soap-Opera-ish?\n\nI'm not going to lie, I read the trilogy once and I was like, \"whatever, this is the junk food to my brain\". It wasn't good, but whatever... it served some purpose. Did I think that it was the greatest love story? Nope. Did I think it was a great romantic story? Nope. I was honestly intrigued by the fetish that surrounds BDSM. But it turned out, that even if the sex was hot, it wasn't even portrayed properly. BDSM is a whole other level.\n\nI was walking out and a lot of the viewers said that it did poorly in capturing the book. Like sure, the sex was there, but that connectivity...intimacy... was not. It was like : fight, bang (sex). Argument, bang. Present, bang again. It was repetitive in the sense of just make-up sex all the time. Ana is annoying. She doesn't know what she wants in the film or in life. Its like she can't take Christian's dark ways and not kidding, a few seconds later she's okay with it, without any solidifying reason (unless its going down on her or sex) . I feel like FSoG (2015) attempted some direction towards a woman's viewpoint. Like Ana being \"dominant\" in the sense of negotiation and choices. In this film, I'm sorry...she comes off like a gold-digger. She comes off like the only reason she's with him is because he's rich. Its like \"I can't be with you, like this...(he gives her a gift), oh, I love you!) WTF? She tries so hard to be her own woman, but really ends up being Christian's (and not in the cute way like \"Oh, I'm his girl *googly-eyes*) I feel that FSoG (2015) did a better job in where Ana had control and it made sense. Here it's wishy-washy.\n\nIts just a mess, not sexy, everything is rushed that you don't understand the reasoning behind motives. They cut off and rushed great moments and characters that could have given the film more sense, romance and great eroticism. Yes its funny because it tries so hard to take itself serious. But that's about it.",

            "content": "Yes, it's terrible, but it's also laughable. In many ways, Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, particularly the writing. Though the chemistry between Johnson and Dornan has improved, the movie has also completely removed all the dramatic stakes that the first film had. In the first film, the couples wanted to be together despite their incompatibility and ultimately separated because of their differences. In Fifty Shades Darker, their differences are resolved very early in the movie, so there's no need to root for them for the rest of the film.\n\nThough it's great to see a couple in a healthy relationship, it also makes for a really uninteresting movie, especially when you don't care about any of the characters. Anastasia's little personality that she had in the first film is now stripped away as she conforms herself to Christian Grey, who (despite giving up his BDSM lifestyle to be with Anastasia) is still the same manipulative control freak that he was in the first film.\n\nAnastasia doesn't know what she wants in this movie. First, she tells him she wants to take it slow after they got back together, and then they have sex in the same scene. She's also very nostalgic about the red room. \n\nThere's a scene that bothered me where Christian Grey transfers $24,000 into Anastasia's bank account after they had sex (the same sex scene described in the last paragraph). In the next scene, they're at a coffee shop and Christian invites Anastasia to a ball, but she tells him she doesn't have the dress for it. Bitch, he just gave you $24,000! Don't tell him you don't have a dress for the ball when he gave you $24,000.\n\nEvery men in Fifty Shades Darker are all creepy. For some reason, Jose is back (the guy who forced himself onto Anastasia in the previous film) and Anastasia is still friends with him. My favourite character in the move is Anastasia's sexually harassing boss named Jack (played by Eric Johnson), who gets instantly jealous when he sees Anastasia with Christian Grey, and also tried to force himself onto her. His character was ridiculously over-the-top and hilarious. I think Fifty Shades Darker is the only film where I found sexual harassment funny. I hope Eric Johnson gets more screen time in Freed as he's the only reason why I have an iota of interest in the next film. Sexual harassment is obviously no laughing matter, but it's impossible to take Fifty Shades Darker seriously as there are many pointless subplots in the film. There are flashbacks of Grey being abused as a child, a subplot involving his ex-girlfriend who's jealous of Anastasia, and a helicopter crash where Grey miraculously survives. \n\nFifty Shades Darker was also written by E. L. James's husband, Niall Leonard. Kelly Marcel and Sam Taylor-Johnson (writer and director of the first film) at least tried to subvert the ridiculousness of the source material. There was no doubt that creative differences led to the change in the creative team, and I knew this change would make the movie worse. Niall Leonard and director James Foley will, unfortunately, return for the third and final film.\n\nThough Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, I enjoyed it more because of it. It's the best comedy of 2017 next to The Bye Bye Man. Even if you didn't like the first film, I would still recommend Fifty Shades Darker to those who enjoy terrible movies.",

I must say though that my opinion is quite positive. I found Fifty Shades Darker to be an enjoyable movie. I started this film with the question \"How am I going to watch this for two hours?\" but it ended before I realised it.\n\nFirst off, let me say, I am a sucker for all things romantic and I think the Fifty Shades movies are that as well. It's all quite a cliche (another thing that I love) and in some cases that comes with a not so great storyline. Fifty Shades Darker is one of those cases. What made this movie an good movie, in my opinion, are the actors and the camera work. The only actress that was a bit of a disappointment for me was Dakota Johnson. She was a great Ana in the first film but I feel like she decided to put a lot more of herself into Ana which kind of bothered me. I was pleasantly surprised by Eric Johnson, whom I've only seen in Hallmark movies. Jamie Dornan is always great so, don't have much more to add to that, ha. The camera work and all the sets were great tho. Grey's apartment, I mean, yas.\n\nYup. I enjoyed it and I'm probably gonna watch it again someday. #noshame",

I would be lying if I said I'd walked in with high expectations for this \"film\". Look, I saw the first one and it made me barf inside my own soul. But this one takes atrocious to a whole new level. I consider myself a positivist when it comes to movies but there are not many redeemable qualities about this washed up sequel. Firstly, the trailers made it look like a Eyes Wide Shut kind of movie, clearly hinting at a secret society of some sorts which is never even grazed on. Secondly, going from both a female director and screenwriter to male \"filmmakers\" was a lunatic decision! The direction is astoundingly deficient, and it's topped by any celebrities' sex tape; the editing is bizarre and the script... the script is something out of this world! I do realize that much of the fault can be attributed to that senseless women E. L. James' source material but the script has no idea of how humans interact and what's behind characters' decision. Watching Christian and Anastasia talking is as awkward as that time you first tried role playing, but this time there's no happy ending. There's so much in this \"film\" that is laughable and unbearable that I often found refuge in checking if that Exit sign was still there. What's more, the sex scenes weren't even exciting! It felt like the whole movie was constructed around them, as they don't seem to communicate with the scenes that come before or after them. The sex was so boring and misplaced and made two attractive people feel like they were taken off Battleship Earth. Furthermore, the performances are shocking, what is that? The lack of life, intonation and nuance from both actors should trigger a mechanism for them to be expelled from Hollywood. Trump, take notice! These \"filmmakers\" and actors are the ones you should be deporting!\nBut wait, there's more! And this one is a biggie. What's more infuriating about this sequel is that it is incredibly misogynistic. It's off the wall when a movie that's so clearly marketed to women is also deeply degrading to them. First, no one and I say no one would come back to him time and time again, no matter how cute the puppy eyes and second, it's the 21st century and, guess what, you don't need a man to make it through life. This film reinforces so many stereotypes like the notion that the woman should be submissive in bed and in the relationship, that conversation is mediated by the man, that the women can't protect themselves from the harsh world out there and that objectification is acceptable. And yet, to try to compensate this, Anastasia says \"no, I order for myself\" and \"no, I don't want you anymore\" and \"ew, my boss wants to rape me\" because god forbid there's a man that doesn't want to have sex with white bread Dakota. To all women out there, if you go watching this film with your boyfriend or girl friends, you are encouraging the perpetuation of resolute gender roles in our society, you're giving the man the power to choose for you and you're allowing misogyny to grow. This film represents everything that's wrong with mass female-targeted entertainment and it's like what a straight guy thinks being screwed in the butt feels like.",

It was just rubbish to watch unfold and I have seen better sex scenes in PG-13 movies than in this R rated film. The dialogue was also just completely terrible and I found myself sighing in annoyance with the worst lines and laughing at the most serious moments. From what I heard about the books, they were also horribly written and I can't imagine those being worse than the movies. There is no weight to the film it's completely dull in every sense, the director James Foley of the really good Glengarry Glen Ross directs the film awfully making it one of the most boring films I had ever seen, and gifted composer Danny Elfman creates his most by-the-numbers music in these movies. When the movie maybe presents something that could be interesting, it is thrown to the wayside to show more boring ass scenes of more romancing, kissing, and sex. Great actresses like Kim Basinger and Marcia Gay Harden are wasted in forgettable and useless roles. Overall, this is the second time in a row that these stars and filmmakers have crafted something completely awful and I do not look forward to what they have in store for the hopefully final chapter in Fifty Shades Freed.",

            "content": "There's a particular adage describing how the certain solid material looks of the top of the septic tank. This is a crude analogy to use about a movie, but in this instance, the consensus is accepted. The movie represented by the waste material in this comparison is 'Fifty Shades Darker,' the second in a trilogy of the movie adaptation of the best-selling novels written by E. L. James. Audiences around the world have already been afflicted with the opening salvo on this front, good taste 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' and undoubtedly have 'Fifty Shades Freed,' in the foreseeable future. Some may understandably wonder how it will be so universally panned by critics could be assured filling out a complete trilogy of movies. The movie of the consideration at an estimated budget of some $55 million over most of it was recouped on opening night eventually starting to well over double the investment without even considering income derived from Blu-ray/DVD and cable licensing fees. Unless you've been living in a pop-culture free environment for the last two years you undoubtedly aware of the fundamental plot of the series of movies, and perhaps a specific focus of the second film. The story follows a rather naïve young woman drawn into the influence of a man who is wealthy and powerful and also quite into the sexual practice known as BDSM, a.k.a. Bondage, discipline, sadomasochism. In the first story, the powerful man in the designated damsel restricts their pursuit of fetishism to the bedroom. Now, take the show on the road and explore various establishments and groups with devotees of the practice and gathered together. Since the subject matter so overly sexualized it would be a completely natural conclusion to expect a substantial amount of nudity. Right up front, it should be noted that only an estimated 9% of the film is over sexual content. That's less than 12 minutes of a running time of the 118 minutes. Back when I was a kid, long before the age of the Internet, you check the Catholic newspaper, The Tablet, for films listed as condemned by the Church. They were the ones we would inevitably try to see the next weekend. Even by the puerile standards of the 60s, teenage boys would be disappointed in the eroticism of this movie.\n\nThis story moves directly into some of the psychological and emotional influences that help shape the sexual predilections of Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). After breaking up with his girlfriend, the enigmatic Mr. Grey begins experiencing intense nightmares forcing him to revisit the abuse he suffered as a child. Meanwhile, his former liaison, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is moving on with her life including a new job as an assistant for an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing, Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson). Since this story is ostensibly a romance, albeit a very unorthodox variation, it should come as no surprise that Mr. Hyde is interested in Ana. Initially, the dramatic motivation was whether or not Ana was given to the seductive Mr. Grey. In an attempt to change the underlying narrative reflects a slightly different direction; Christian now has a romantic rival adding to his concerns. Even the worst movies can contain a few aspects properly handled. To the credit of the screenwriter, Niall Leonard, the time is wasted to reunite Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele. Ana was attending an art gallery show featuring a friend of hers, Jose Rodriguez' (Victor Rasuk). Among the other guests she happens to spot Christian Grey, and after a bit small talk, she reluctantly agrees to go to dinner with him. Any reasonable person would hear his voice in the back of the head screaming while watching this point of the film, which after everything that happened in the previous movie why would she risks falling back into the same routine. The answer is quite simple. If she declined the invitation, the movie would probably qualify as a short. It is the most blatant of plot contrivances but considering the overall quality and veracity of the story any complaints would be meaningless. Christian does make the requisite plea to accept his offer by stating that he has changed. If you saw this in the theater and happened to look around at this moment, you undoubtedly see every woman's head nodding in disbelief.\n\nThe movie proceeds to construct an overly convoluted tangle of interrelationships. Ana encounters a woman who looks strikingly similar to her later when she's having drinks with Jack; conveniently Christian is there as well. When he witnesses Jack's Cretaceous attitude towards Ana, he abruptly leaves taking Ana with him explaining that her boss at less than honorable intentions but is not so innocent flirting. Christian explains to her that this company has been seriously considering taking over SIP. That would ensure that Christian would not be out of Ana's life anytime soon. He also revealed her that the woman she saw him with that look similar to her was Leila Williams, portrayed by Jazmine Campanale, Ms. Johnson's stand-in. He explained that she was one of his former submissiveness demonstrating that he obviously has a particular physical type that he finds attractive. To infuse a modicum of suspense into the proceedings, Christian provides a bit of the woman's back story. After leaving him, she got married, but recently her husband died. Since then she has taken upon herself to stalk Ana and Christian.\n\nIf it weren't for the fact that Christian was a man, this tale of his scarring childhood would be consistent with a Lifetime movie. His mother was a prostitute addicted to crack in his birth mother committed suicide. As a child, he was taken in by Grace Trevelyan Grey (Marcia Gay Harden), who eventually adopted him. Later on, Ana meets a woman Christians past, Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger), who is Christian's business partner and former dominant. To keep things, spicy turns out the Christian life to be not just on the giving side of S&M at the receiving side as well. The big scene that dominated the trailers is the BDSM masquerade ball. The setting, obviously inspired by the central sexual intrigue for Stanley Kubrick's final film, 'Eyes Wide Shut.' I always enjoy a movie that requires the audience to devote their attention to the storyline. It is exciting to see various threads of the story become woven together as the narrative progresses. Instead of individual threads of a beautiful tapestry, the elaborate nature of the story closely resembles a tango Christmas tree lights when you retrieve them from storage in December. Just as that inexorable morass of wires and bulbs promised to be something special, the only thing that provided is frustration, disillusionment, and disappointment.\n\nObviously, there is a fan base for this series of movies is evident not only by the box office success despite being dismissed by critics but also the best-selling status of the novels. The main difference between the three books in the franchise and the Pope Romance novels so popular for women to read on the beach that the 'Shades of Grey' stories were published in hardcover conferring upon them a semblance of literary worth. I happen to agree with what many people have noted that if you want to watch an erotic drama, you will find more success watching Cinemax After-Hours than anything this movie can offer. The movie is available in Ultra high definition, 4K, in case you are inclined to spend even more to have the video as sharp as currently available.",

The acting, especially from the lead couple, hasn't improved, the writing isn't any more insightful or less laughable, and the plot isn't any less repetitive. You could play a drinking game while watching it and do a shot for every time Christian steps out of a black SUV, every time he and Ana attend a fancy party, every time they text each other, every time they sleep together and every time a question is asked that either never gets answered or simply leads to more questions. The first movie's biggest sin was that it was boring, and this one, while still having its sporadically interesting moments, also can't disguise the blatant flaws of its source material. Why does Ana do such a quick U-turn when it comes to how she feels about Christian? One minute she wants nothing to do with him, then she can't stand to be away from him for a second? And why is Christian so able to completely give up the only life he's known because of a single person he has nothing in common with? It's completely nonsensical, and a cheap excuse to film a series of sex scenes which don't even, ahem, climax, instead just ending with a jump cut to a completely location. It has no reason to be nearly 2 hours long, but manages to pad itself out with a helicopter crash of all things, and one in which nobody suffers more than superficial injuries. It's like even the movie had no idea where to go and panicked when it realised there was still time left to fill. Mercifully there's only 1 film left, and while it might be the best in the trilogy, that is a very low bar to clear.",

I have watched it many times since it's release both in the theater and, by DVD...\nAnd each time one scene comes into play, my heart speeds up because, in my mind, I know how the scene is supposed to play out and then... I cringe.\nI know it is coming. I know the same results are going to happen each time but, my mind, knowing the books, knowing how the director -should- have directed Jamie to perform... I have this pain in my soul because Jamie is a great actor. I just think this was not the right part for him.\nI can forgive that the movie didn't really follow the book. So that was a let down from the start however, the idea is there, and so I can forgive that but, as a fan of the book... yes, I can hear your collective groans, I really had high hopes after seeing Jamie cast as this character until... that.. one.. scene.\n\nThe scene... spoiler(ish) alert.\n\nAnna has just come back from her \"walk\" after the Lyla incident.\nChristain and Anna are having it out over whether or not Anna can fullfill his needs, and Christain, being afraid that Anna is leaving him, submits to her, by kneeling in front of her.\nIn the movie, this is all done with barely any feeling, and so nonchalantly, I honestly wondered if either Jamie or the director had bothered to read the series or not.\nIn the book.. Christain is panicked. He is scared. His emotions, which he has no experience dealing with, are flying all over the place! His heart is breaking into a million pieces, and he feels like he is losing everything, all because he, in his mind, is a monster, one which Anna could never love.\nThat raw emotion. In the books, he is fighting, arguing, crying, begging. \nHe is completely NOT himself. And suddenly. It all stops, and he throws himself down on his knees. Completely submission. Docile. \nThat pain, and emotion, and loss... Jamie just doesn't deliver it.\nThe thing is, with the proper direction, he could have gotten there!!!\nThis is something that bothers me with many directors.\nIt's THEIR JOB to get the correct response from their actors.\nThere are so many scenes from both movies that I could dissect like this... however, this was the most disappointing scene in ALL of the movies Jamie Dornan has been in.\nIt honestly makes me so angry when I see an actor's potential hidden, and screwed with like this.\nAs for my mental and almost physical response to this scene... as I said, I am a fan of the series. Sure it's about D/S relationships but, that is not what I got from the series. There was so much more than just sex. And, I tend to lose myself in books. If I can connect with the characters than I feel that is a great experience with the authors. I find it a disservice to the author, as well as the actors.\nThis could have been an amazing movie, if the actors had just had a better more attentive director.\nAnd, just to point out, I am not saying that maybe the director hasn't had other hits... to be honest, I didn't look into it because of this epic fail at directing THIS film... but, I think that the director failed this movie. \nSigh... that is all I will say. For now. Hey, there is another movie still to come. See you all then!",

So I doubt anybody will be bored of it, which means watchable film and instead it won't be their favourite.\n\nThe story continued and this time it was not based on experiment or any kind of agreement, but mutual understanding. So the billionaire Grey and Ana's erotic adventure sustains. With the small-small developments the film goes all the way to the ending. That means, those who are watching it for the selected scenes, will surely would have a nice time. But nothing was strong as any European film on the similar theme.\n\nApart from the weak storyline, there's nothing wrong with it. As to what this film is about, it served better. That's what I say to you not to expect full storied romance-drama. As usual the actors were good and another two films to come in the 'Fifty Shades' franchise. I hope they can be better than the first two. Overall, it is only for the selected audience, but curiosity makes everybody watch it and they all pour they perspective which is flooded with average to negative.

It's length transcends time. The film itself is a measurement of meaningless length that has yet to be defined by mankind, with pockets of absolute drowning nothingness thrown in for sure. Performances are horrible, yet both leads have a clear warm chemistry which makes it all the more disjointed in a script that treats itself and its audience like feces at the bottom of your shoe.

Strangely enough I thought the first film Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) was decent. Not a movie I would see again, but it wasn't super controversial like they were advertising it. This movie takes the plot of that film (which was thin to begin with) and then hits us with some shit for the next two hours. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is still reeling from her relationship with Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Then five minutes into the film they get back together. Wow. Just. Like. That. Truthfully there isn't much more to the film. We get some background on Christian. We learn about his first lady friend Elena (Kim Basinger). We learn that he's crazy as hell and controlling. And we learn that Dakota Johnson can't act to save her damn life. Full of some terrible sex scenes (Christian wearing pants the whole time eh?) this film just misses the mark. It's obviously setting up the final film Fifty Shades Freed (2018), but there's so much that doesn't happen in this movie that the pacing gets hurt big time with loads of time where we get some scenes with Ana just kinda talking...not moving plot at all. Overall, I'm not the target audience for this one. This is a film to avoid at all costs. It seriously only gets on star since the soundtrack is fire though.",

She trying to accept his kinky side, but likewise, it is new to her.  This sequel is all about them furthering their relationship while trying to weather previous lovers popping back into Christian's life.  At this point, everybody knows why this series was written: it is socially acceptable smut for bored housewives because it is in the form of a book.  I will straight up tell you that I've never read this book series, and will likely never do so for a number of different reasons, but a movie, I can handle, because it is done and over in two hours.  The first movie was pretty tame all things considered, and for what it's worth, this movie does up the ante to the next level.  Now don't get me wrong, this is still a bad movie that is chock filled with problems.  There's glaring issues that don't make sense from a logical standpoint.  For one, this is a girl that perpetually has three to four guys fighting for affection.  Don't get me wrong, Dakota Johnson is a pretty enough actress, but she just doesn't have that x-factor.  Her character is written to be homely and plain, and it never makes sense on just why she is the apple of the eye of so many suitors.  Then there is Christian, who is just a book of complexes.  He's an overprotective control freak and just Batmans into a scene with the quickness, so much so that it is alarming.  I mean really, all you have to do is change the soundtrack to something like John Carpenter's Halloween and you could completely change the entire movie... but that would never happen, because they've got their own soundtrack to sell here.  This is still Twilight fan-fiction, and you can always see the shaky foundation that this was built on.  It is sillier, but at the same time, it is sexier, so if that is why you are watching it, you're going to get your fix (I can't imagine any other possible reason for watching this).  I still feel like this movie would be better if it just went for it, and because the acting is marginally better than The Room, this series is never ever going to reach the realm of being so bad it's good.  At the end of the day, the entire reason why you would watch this would be the same if you were to watch a soft-core porno, except that would be a more earnest and efficient use of your time.",

            "content": "Yes, it's terrible, but it's also laughable. In some ways, Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, particularly the writing. Though the chemistry between Johnson and Dornan has improved, the movie has also completely removed all the dramatic stakes that the first film had. In the first film, the couples wanted to be together despite their incompatibility and ultimately separated because of their differences. In Fifty Shades Darker, their differences are resolved very early in the movie, so there's no need to root for them for the rest of the film.\n\nThough it's great to see a couple in a healthy relationship, it also makes for a really uninteresting movie, especially when you don't care about any of the characters. Anastasia's little personality that she had in the first film is now stripped away as she conforms herself to Christian Grey, who (despite giving up his BDSM lifestyle to be with Anastasia) is still the same manipulative control freak that he was in the first film.\n\nAnastasia doesn't know what she wants in this movie. First, she tells him she wants to take it slow after they got back together, and then they have sex in the same scene. She's also very nostalgic about the red room. \n\nThere's a scene that bothered me where Christian Grey transfers $24,000 into Anastasia's bank account after they had sex (the same sex scene described in the last paragraph). In the next scene, they're at a coffee shop and Christian invites Anastasia to a ball, but she tells him she doesn't have the dress for it. He just gave you $24,000! Don't tell him you don't have a dress for the ball when he gave you $24,000.\n\nEvery men in Fifty Shades Darker are all creepy. For some reason, Jose is back (the guy who forced himself onto Anastasia in the previous film) and Anastasia is still friends with him. My favourite character in the move is Anastasia's sexually harassing boss named Jack (played by Eric Johnson), who gets instantly jealous when he sees Anastasia with Christian Grey, and also tried to force himself onto her. His character was ridiculously over-the-top and hilarious. I think Fifty Shades Darker is the only film where I found sexual harassment funny. I hope Eric Johnson gets more screen time in Freed as he's the only reason why I have an iota of interest in the next film. Sexual harassment is obviously no laughing matter, but it's impossible to take Fifty Shades Darker seriously as there are many pointless subplots in the film. There are flashbacks of Grey being abused as a child, his ex-girlfriend who's jealous of Anastasia's relationship to Christian, and a helicopter crash where Grey miraculously survives. \n\nFifty Shades Darker was also written by E. L. James's husband, Niall Leonard. Kelly Marcel and Sam Taylor-Johnson (writer and director of the first film) at least tried to subvert the ridiculousness of the source material. There was no doubt that creative differences led to the change in the creative team, and I knew this change would make the movie worse. Niall Leonard and director James Foley will, unfortunately, return for the third and final film.\n\nThough Fifty Shades Darker is worse than the first film, I enjoyed it more because of it. It's the best comedy of the year next to The Bye Bye Man. Even if you didn't like the first film, I would still recommend Fifty Shades Darker to those who enjoy terrible movies.",

            "content": "Throughout the years, cinema has had its high points and its low points. On average, there is a general 50% percent between the good and the bad, but Fifty Shades Darker is on a new level. Let's be clear and say that there really wasn't anything good about the first film. It was a horrible script with a bad plot that wasn't very exciting, but somehow Fifty Shades Darker makes the original bearable. I felt like I was in a trance during my viewing of this picture, wondering why I even chose to watch it. Slowly becoming fascinated with how atrociously bad nearly every single second was, I just had to finish it. If anything is worse than this film this year I will genuinely be shocked. Here is why this film should be seen by every filmmaker as a lesson on how to not make a film. \n\nA film can take its time revealing what its premise is truly about in order to savour the flavour of its twists, but when a story never reveals itself, it makes its audience feel robbed. Following the conclusion that had Anastasia Steele leaving Christian Grey at the end of the first film, you'd expect that the sequel would be about one of them trying to win the other back, but that happens within the first five minutes of the film. For the next two hours, you will find yourself watching a series of dates, sex scenes, stalkers following them, and stupid injections into the so-called story that made the film laughable to say the very least. The plot of this film is that they date, develop some sort of relationship and eventually fall in love. That's it, seriously. With no inciting incidents and reluctance to have anything bearing happen, I found myself amazed that this film was even made. \n\nMost critics hate on Johnson and Dornan for having zero chemistry with one another, but that was not an issue I had with the first film, in fact they elevated the lame premise for me. That being said, even I can see that neither one of them are giving it their all here. It felt like they were forcing kinky aspects into the film when necessary, solely for the purpose of stimulating the audience. For that reason alone I felt betrayed as an audience member. Making half a billion dollars at the box office the first time around, Fifty Shades Darker barely cracked half of that. It just goes to show that quality does trump all every now and then. \n\nI've never read these novels, but it felt like the sequences that had the character of Leila stalking Christian was forced into the story to pad out the run time, making it seem like it had a bigger purpose than what was on the surface. From this stupid element to an element that has Christian facing someone from his past, to being able to overcome certain memories, everything about the small side plots throughout this film felt laughable to me. Look, I was one of the people that defended the original train wreck of a film for not being quite as horrible as people suggested it was, but there is absolutely nothing redeemable about this sequel. \n\nIn the end, there isn't a single audience I can recommend this to. Sure, it's aimed at older women, but I can even see them chuckling throughout a lot of this film. Their chemistry, along with the overall \"plot\" of this film was a step down from what was already a lacklustre film. From the horrendous dialogue to the laughter-inducing sex sequences with blaring pop music, Fifty Shades Darker feels like a parody of this genre, unintentionally. I honestly don't know how we live in a time where three of these films are being made, but this film is so terrible that I'm actually curious to see if it can get any worse than this. If you haven't seen either of these films, especially this one, you're doing yourself a very solid favour.",

            "content": "I signed up just to say how horrible this movie is. \nFirst the pace. The whole film is about as slow as an old man in a walker. It's moving but it never gets far. In the few parts where it seems? like it'll speed up it follows the old man formula and falls flat. More an exercise in patience than an enjoyable experience.\nSecond the story. Stew meat is held together better than this. One second you're at a party, the next your in a bedroom, then a parking garage all loosely held together.  Whole sections felt disjoined not just from previous and following scenes but from the entire movie. Certain characters and plot points are introduced and then never fleshed out. All could have been cut to make an infinitely better movie.\nThird the sex scenes. Completely un-f***ing-fappable. They have all the appeal of watching your grandparents have sex on a hot summer afternoon. Interestingly they're also that dry. For a movie so hyped on them they're pretty much an after thought. There's not enough sex, or bondage play, to make them interesting. Plus they're too short. It's almost like the director said \"The movies to short. Add a sex scene to make it a couple minutes longer!\" The nudity in said scenes makes you wonder why it was even included. Pretty much it's \"here's tits badly shot. Be happy about it.\" \nNone of that compares to the ending though. The ending that confirms you will have to sit through another of these movies. If you're like me you'll be seriously considering ending any relationships until after the final movie comes out just to avoid seeing it. When you do decide to be in another relationship lie about seeing all these abominations just to avoid seeing them. Oh and you were hoping for a little something later because of this? Nope. Your libido is deader than Grey's mother after the first 15 minutes and will be for days.",

            "content": "Anime critic Jacob Chapman was once asked whether he would ever review hentai (Japanese animated pornography, for those not in the know). He replied that he wouldn't because it was impossible to review porn objectively. Other genres, he argued, could be judged according to certain seemingly objective standards (a good comedy makes you laugh, a good horror movie make you scared and so on), whereas porn rises or falls (ha ha) purely on the preferences of the viewer. In praising or criticising any given piece of erotic content, one runs the risk of projecting one's own sexual tastes onto the material and, in doing so, putting rather more than is necessary out into the public sphere.\n\nWhen reviewing erotic thrillers or dramas, therefore, one always has to assess any film on the basis of its structural and narrative integrity regardless of our more bestial responses to its salacious moments. Compared to its predecessor, Fifty Shades Darker may provide more by way of titillation, with a conscious effort to make the sex scenes more daring and ambitious (and more public) than before. But once these sections are taken out of the equation, the film becomes a very listless and lacklustre affair - it's an erotic drama which is occasionally erotic but never dramatic.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the first film was the lack of agency afforded to Anastasia as a character - something which, it is claimed, she has more of in the books. Without any form of serious resistance (or anything more than mild reluctance) on her part, the film resembles an anaemic version of Dracula, with the mysterious rich gentleman preying on the virginal beauty. If we take this aspect in isolation, Fifty Shades Darker does improve on its predecessor, insofar as they are more scenes of Ana putting her foot down and wanting a relationship on her terms. But in the wider context of things, the film makes so many other steps backwards that this improvement becomes barely noticeable.\n\nFifty Shades Darker (Darker hereafter) suffers from the increased role of E. L. James in its production. Whether you like her work or not, adaptations can often suffer from the author being too close to the work and stifling the screenwriter's creativity; as I mentioned in my review of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, novelists who get involved in film-making so often lack the visual invention to match their verbal acrobatics. Kelly Marcel's script for the first film was largely flat and often risible, but you occasionally got a glimmer of effort being made to shape the material for the screen rather than kowtow to the author. This film's screenplay, on the other hand, comes from James' husband Niall Leonard; it feels more carefully controlled, so that the entire exercise becomes a means of indulging James' ego rather than serving the material or - heaven forbid - entertaining the audience.\n\nThis increased sense of control is also reflected in the choice of director. Sam Taylor-Johnson didn't see eye to eye with James during the production of the first film, so it isn't any real surprise that she decided to pull out of shooting the sequels back to back. Watching the film did feel like wading knee-deep through wallpaper paste, but you did at least get the impression of the director and cast trying to go against the tide of the material and emerge with something half-decent. With James Foley behind the camera as a workmanlike safe pair of hands, the characters have stopped wading and decided to lie flat on their backs on top, as the waves slowly drag them away. The film feels slow, ponderous and devoid of any pep when either or both of its leading players are fully clothed.\n\nThe sex scenes in Darker are an illustration of the film's central problem, which the increased role of James and the kid gloves approach of Foley both hint towards. Watching the scenes in isolation, they are decently assembled in terms of the editing and music compared to those in the first film, which often came across as clinical and awkward. The substance of the sex scenes is still tame by modern standards (the Emmanuelle series or The Story of O were far racier than this), and logic regularly takes a back seat; the film doesn't just not get how S&M relationships work, it doesn't always understand how ben wa balls operate. If you watched the sex scenes on their own, they may or may not do something for you - but they are not integrated with the film as a whole, and that's a big problem.\n\nIn order for an erotic thriller or erotic drama to work, it has to have a compelling story which the sex can either interrupt (in a bad film) or be a somewhat integral part (in a good one). The career of Andrew Davies (who adapted Tipping the Velvet and Fanny Hill for the BBC) is welcome evidence of this. You don't need the most cerebral or original story in the book - Basic Instinct isn't exactly Chinatown in its complexity - but if you don't find a way to integrate the nudity into the plot you end up with a film which feels like two different stories incongruously zipped together. If you don't care about the story, you may as well be watching porn; while Darker can titillate, it cannot captivate.\n\nOnce you take the sex scenes out of Darker, it becomes a boring, overwrought and very waxy soap opera, in which much is talked about but very little actually happens. Much of the action plays out like an episode of Dallas; here, as there, we get a lot of rich people swanning around doing rich people things and bickering over the tiniest detail. The ball scene is an awkward meld of Cinderella and Eyes Wide Shut, but without the wonder of the former or the creeping sense of dread in the latter. You may have a couple of moments of being impressed by the costumes or enjoying the music, but beyond that there is little to sustain our attention.\n\nEven by the low standards of the first film, Darker is a poorly written piece of work. All the character issues that were present in the first film are magnified here; the more stuff Christian buys to impress Ana and convince her that he's changed, the more creepy and suffocating he becomes. For every moment where we are let in to some part of his subconscious and given some reason to question our initial suspicions about him, part of us is always on edge and wanting to leave. But even if the characters aren't an issue for you, the film is choppily plotted and quickly descends into travelogue footage; as in some of the weaker James Bond films, people go to exotic places for no apparent reason, stay there for hardly any time at all and then leave with no explanation.\n\nThis latter problem - exemplified by the section involving the helicopter crash - only serves to emphasise how stake-free the film feels, and how much its attempts at generating tension or emotional weight fall flat. It's easy to make cheap jokes about how the series started out as Twilight fan fiction, but the script for Darker plays out like fan fiction, insofar as it goes to ridiculous extremes to put the author's chosen couple together - the results of which are regularly an anticlimax. The arbitrary changes in location also prevent any real chemistry from building between the characters, and the attempts to bringing out a darker tone (such as in the opening scenes) feel either desperate or just too jarring to be effective.\n\nThe final aspect which prevents Darker from being even a passable erotic thriller is the performances. The on-screen relationship between Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson was always awkward, but here the awkwardness is increased by the plot's attempts at raising the stakes. Johnson's irritating breathy delivery is even more annoying here, and her attempts at sounding firm or frightened are unconvincing. Dornan, equally, is too deadpan and often seems to abruptly zone out in the middle of a scene. Where before the pair made an effort in spite of the material, here they are merely going through the motions. Mind you, they aren't the only ones who are unimpressive; Rita Ora is grating, Eloise Mumford is uninspiring, and Kim Basinger looks and performs like a waxwork animatronic. It's a million miles from her work in 9 1/2 Weeks, in terms of either raunchiness or screen presence.\n\nFifty Shades Darker is a dismal and dreary sequel which does away with most of the few qualities the first film possessed. In Foley's hands, with James looming over him in the background, the film quickly descends into a series of occasionally titillating sex scenes intercut with dull, poorly staged and entirely non-compelling character drama. It's not offensively bad enough to be terrible, but it is deeply unmemorable, leaving one feeling hollow, depressed and more than a little short-changed.",

            "content": "I think no-one can deny the fact that this was the most hotly anticipated sequel of 2017, 'Fifty Shades Darker' follows the events of Fifty Shades of Grey where...... who gives a shit. Nothing here is anything more than what you expect it to be, you have your lifeless, dull characters, stupidly horrible dialogue, poor directing all bundled together in this cluster of hilariously laughable shit. I swear this film has to secretly be a comedy or a satire, i don't think a soul in the world can watch this thing and actually take it seriously. And what is the plot you may ask????? There isn't one. It's 2 hours of subplots that start from nothing and go no-where rendering this whole movie nothing more than maybe 10 minutes of sex spaced out with various boring ass scenes written by a bored as shit housewife. It tries to actually add some moments of tension, and mystery, and drama, and intrigue, but it's just so ridiculous. \n\nFirstly, the dialogue in this movie is SO bad, it is undoubtedly some of the worst content i have ever heard. Every conversation is so stale and corny to the point where potentially 'serious' conversations are actually funny. Not even kidding, i laughed more in this movie than most comedies that came out last year. It is hysterical that not one person during production didn't turn around and say \"yeh, this line sounds stupid, we should change it\". Instead, everyone just went with it and the end result is..... something, it's definitely something. But it isn't just the dialogue, every character in this movie is so flat, dry, and overwhelmingly uninteresting. The writing of everyone, especially Christian Grey is so thin you can barely call them characters, they're all walking shells lacking personality and all the basic qualities that make up a person. Anastasia Steele i could go on and on about how the way her character is (to put it simply) infuriatingly backwards but i'll save you the reading and just say she's pathetic. \n\nAnd i've got nothing against the performances of Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, i mean, you can tell they're both basically just mailing it in and i don't blame them, at this point they should just take the paycheck, get through it, and get out. Some of the other side performances though are really bad. And just to be clear, the writing doesn't do them any favours, so keep that in mind. Kim Basinger also stars in this film and i know what you're asking; Who does she play? Well, if i knew who her character was and what her role was in the film i'd tell you, but i watched the entire movie and i still have no fucking idea. Her name is Elena, and she was annoying as shit but i have no idea how she fit in to this story whatsoever....... writing everyone, this is how you do it...... \n\nAnd the plot as i mentioned earlier, it's non-existent, there is no followthrough of any storyline from start to finish that extends beyond Anastasia and Christian's back and forth love scenes. There are so many small insignificant side plots injected throughout this film that you cannot keep up with any of them and all of them are stupid and literally insignificant. Nothing has any payoff, shit happens out of nowhere, it's a big deal for 5 minutes, and then it is either slightly resolved or just forgotten. I mean, in like the final act of the film there is a helicopter crash mystery that comes out of nowhere, literally it just happens with no context. And you think ok, this pointless side plot is going to ride the film out to its finale, but in 5 minutes it's resolved and everyone forgets about it....... it's just so frustratingly stupid. \n\nBut in the end, for everything this film did so pathetically bad it offered many hilarious moments that are the only redeemable qualities about the film. And as you may have gathered, it isn't intentional comedy. Whether it is the laughable dialogue, the hilarious scenes and character interactions (that editor meeting, OMG the elevator), the spontaneous 'Chronicles of Riddick' poster appearance, or the sex timed to the music, this movie could be plenty of fun as a late night comedy.\n\n1.2/10",

There is nothing to this film whatsoever. The performances are cheap, Dakota Johnson tries but is let down completely by her character, and dialogue that is ridiculously silly and over the top. Add to that a drab story that doesn't go anywhere and a complete lack of suspense, Darker doesn't do anything to justify the continuation of this pointless series. It feels like a poor overlong soap opera episode, that shouldn't have aired anyway. There will always be something massively demeaning about the relationship at the center of the films and it is even more humiliating watching the outcome of Steele and her destroyed feminist attempts.

The bootleg I watched had all of the sex scenes removed, so I fortunately skipped all of the pap and got straight to the smear. This worked out perfectly for two reasons. For one, it's kind of embarrassing to eat a whole cucumber by myself during an erotic thriller. Second, the sex scenes might be too tittilating. This is uncomfortable as I am a devout Mormon and refuse to commit sexual relations until I am faithfully wed to my second and third wives. Speaking of Mormons, Stephanie Meyer, the author of the \"Twilight\" saga, inspired E.L. James to adapt her erotic \"Twilight\" fan fiction (titled \"Master of the Universe\") into what we now know as the \"Fifty Shades\" trilogy. Needless to say, fans of the \"Twilight\" books and movies will thoroughly enjoy the romance and nuanced acting common to both film franchises. Not having seen the preceding film, I was hoping that I could just infer what happened before the events in this movie. I did. Christian Grey is a sexy businessman who grew up in a broken home with a crack whore mother. He escaped his humble beginnings to become an illuminati-tier billionaire who enlists young women to sign BDSM contracts so he can violently (and romantically) act out his childhood trauma on them - with a heart of gold. Anastasia Steele is a beautiful girl-next-door who wants to make a career in the publishing industry on her own terms (presumably to distribute her \"Twilight\" fan fiction). After a rough patch of enduring Christian's abuse and breaking up, she immediately gets back together with him after he buys the company she works for and forces his way back into her heart because he is sorry about the sexual and mental abuse. I assume they have lots of steamy sexual sex because there is 20 minutes of footage missing from my copy. But their love is imperiled by everyone wanting to assault Anastasia, and several of Christian's former victims are stalking them. All in all, \"Fifty Shades Darker\" is one of the best comedies I've seen this year, with hints of \"The Room\", \"Showgirls\", and, of course, \"Twilight\" keeping you on your toes, if not rolling on the floor.",

And probably *SPOILERS FOR THE MOST PREDICTABLE STORY EVER*\n\nDamn, the first scene made me think \"wow, we might get character development in this one.\". But then- nope. Than 1 minute later I was like- when is the actual shit gonna start. Cuz this song is annoying, we are 3 minutes in and I already now I'll hate the soundtrack ( I was right btw). Than we go back to the creepiness of the Gray guy. He bought six gigantic pictures of Anastasya ( sorry if I spelled it wrong, I won't bother myself with checking), which were sold without her knowledge or consent. I have no idea how photography works, but I am damn sure it's not like that. Than they renegotiate their deal, She listens to him because reasons, money and plot. And then they kiss and than you realise \"omg they did not fire the writer of the first one\". One of Whatever-his-name-was Grey's submissives comes for a 3 seconds for reasons and jealousy and stuff. Than Jordan Belfort's idiotic evil twin crashes Anelia Wood and he bosses meeting, because convenience and \ncoincidence and probably stalking, knowing that guy. and than comes the sex scene and oh my god, I should've payed for a brazzer's subscription instead of giving this movie money. Oh, yeah, and someone was actually paid to write this. I don't know if it is the source material or the script, but it is still awful. I mean, I can find better scripted sex scenes on PornHub. Also, than it dawned me that the chemistry between the main actors suck. And than he has her banking account information! Information that was discussed between the main characters off screen... I guess... because... creepiness. Than weirdness surrounding Alastatasya haircut and more ex-submissive bullshit. And more creepiness. I am trying to understand this movie, but I just can't see the appeal. It can probably get a cult following for how awful it is. Who knows. Maybe The Room has a contender. Oh, and the soundtrack is awful. So they go to a party. with her wearing a butt-plug, which I guess she feels only when she is seated, but somehow didn't feel when she was seated in the car. Because plot. Oh, and the script is awful. And then- soft-core porn. Whooray.... Than more delving into Johnny's sad story for about 2 sentences  and than creepiness in the form of obsessed ex that is jealous of Lisa. I mean... white paint? Really? And how did she get in there. Johnny said it himself. I am starting to understand this movie bit by bit. I don't even pay that much attention to be honest. The only thing stopping me from pulling out my phone at that point is that that would be a total dick move to everyone else. After which I decided to shoot myself. End of the story. Which reminds me, They go to Johnny's yacht/ boat/ whatever and they have sex in the shower and they don't even show us that. Which, in retrospect- thank god. Oh look- character development... no, wait, a two sentences of sob story, which would've been more impactfull if I actually care for those sorry excuses of characters. Than Lisa learns to drive a boat. And the sound-track sucks. And than Lisa must go to New York and tells Johnny. Of course she is an independent woman and doesn't need his appr.... oh, wait she agrees the moment he tells her no, I am jealous, you will go with me. How can you not love this movie??? Than- oh, yes, that guy was into BDSM. Never mind that the BDSM isn't researched at all ( I blame the source material) and ... OH MY GOD now he explaining how the tools work. You know, most movies give normal exposition. The annoying, but , sadly, necessary one. This one isn't even needed. The movie would be the same without it. Yay for nostalgia, we are into kink again.. tho last time she hated it... and the soundtrack sucks. OH, WAIT SHE WILL BE FIRED? Give me 1 reason to care. Her boyfriend is a millionaire. Oh, wait, no, Lisa's boss just wants to fuck her. The script is awful btw, just saying. And she chooses Johnny over... what was her boss' name again... let's call him Mark. So Mark is now royally fucked. I am sooo surprised.... (no, I am not). Like, is there 1 person that didn't see this situation coming from the 6th minute. Now she is a big figure in the company or... something. She is at Marks position! I am so happy! (Totally not sarcasm).  I can not see how anyone can see this movie and like it. There are moments like this taht, yes, can be impactfull, if I gave a single shit about the characters, which can not happen with no character development. And their chemistry is awful. Aaand softcore sex... I can find better sex clips right now. Also- weirdness in the form of Johnny's stalker. I knew it was coming the moment he didn't go with her. Can this movie be more predictable?? And the stalker ( and Lisa) voice a point I have been wondering since the first scenes of the first movie. Why her? Is this some kind of reverse- gender Adma Sandler wish fulfillment? In any case it's not much better than an Adam Sandler movie. Hell, I think Adam Sandler's movies are masterpieces compared to this one. And everything is ok in the end. Because predictability. He is mad at Lisa for reasons, which they will resolve in 1 to 2 scenes (because predictability). And the soundtrack sucks. Oh, and Lisa is sassy! And has doubts that she is the right one for Johnny. And their chemistry is awful by the way. The acting is good, everything else- NO! So they swear to love each other and than fuck. Something they (thank god) don't even show us. And he has a nightmare all of a sudden and he proposes to Lisa in the middle of the night. Hooray. They wake up and the soundtrack sucks.  I am losing my patience (and consciousness) with this movie. Until the helicopter crash- than I just facepalmed hard enough to break my nose. He is gone for exactly 3 minutes. And it does nothing to further the plot, the characters or anything. I swear, I 'd break my arms too if this meant the movie ending. I have no idea why I had hopes for this film. I just hoped that it would get better. I really should've just pirated it. So he is back after exactly 3 min. and 30 sec. I decided to count it because I had nothing better to do. So Lisa says yes to his proposal and they end the movie on a sex scene. The soundtrack is awful. And after a generic boring party some random dude appears. I have no idea what the plot of the next one will be, but I sure as hell will hate it. Or a miracle will happen. Which it won't. DO NOT go see it in theaters. I'd say don't buy it. Just borrow a Blu-Ray from somebody dumb enough to buy it if you REALLY wanna see it. Which you shouldn't.",

            "content": "\"If something were to happen to you because of me, I would never forgive myself.\"\n\nOkay, I know I am one of those people who go pay to watch \"porn\" in public, but for the sake of the reviews I felt like this was an important one. Who am I kidding? I love these movies with all their cheap, tacky, cheesy qualities. I'm a sucker for the books and the movies, even though they aren't wonderful. So I took myself and my best friend for a girls night out the night this movie came out and reveled in all of it's glory.\n\nI was mostly excited for this movie because I really enjoyed the second book, more-so than the first one. There was more of a story, and it was a bit more realistic given some of the qualities of the movies. We start off in this movie after Anastasia and Christian have broken up after the events in the last movie.  She is definitely not over the situation(and how hot Mr. Grey is) and is avoiding all of Christian's attempts to win her back. Finally, they meet up at Jose's art gallery, where he weirdly enough has photos of Ana up everywhere. Let's be real, Christian isn't the real creep here, Jose is. Anyway, Christian buys all of the photos and asks Ana out for dinner, to which she agrees because when Christian Grey aka Jamie Dornan asks you out to dinner, you say yes.\n\nFrom dinner we see them start up their relationship again, slowly at first, and then very quickly falling back into the couple they were. They attend masquerade balls together, go to dinner, fall in love, basically they do everything that normal couples do in years in a matter of a couple of weeks.\n\nAna starts a new job at a publishing firm and we meet Jack Hyde, her new boss. He's creepy and is supposed to be kind of an ugly, old guy, but they definitely did not stick to the script. While Eric Johnson was definitely creepy and made me uncomfortable, he wasn't hard to look at. There are tensions between Ana and Hyde from the beginning, and even more tension between Hyde and Christian. Hyde makes it seemingly impossible to work for him and even more impossible to feel comfortable. Throughout the film we also meet Mrs. Robinson who Kim Basinger so eloquently brought to life. She was who I pictured when reading the book, and she made her on screen counterpart just as devious as she was in the book. Rita Ora was an odd choice for me as Mia, but I was pleasantly surprised by the choice. I imagined Mia with a more youthful, innocent presence.\n\nLet's talk about sex, baby. No, but for real. Let's talk about the sex in this movie. I don't care what anyone says about how bad the movies are, the sex is good. At least in this one. There isn't a lot of the BDSM that made so many people so uncomfortable and outraged in the first one. I personally was the most excited for the elevator scene, and I think it did it justice. There were some laughable intimate moments, of course the movies are kind of cheesy and not the books weren't very well written to begin with. But I love that even in those moments, the actors don't break character.\n\nMy final thoughts, because I don't want to give up any spoilers as usual, are on all of the lipstick they put on Dakota Johnson. I'm halfway convinced this movie was just a really long lipstick ad and I am LIVING for it. I have went as far as I can and have written down every lipstick type and shade she has on in that movie to buy. I need them all and I'm convinced that if she can wear them while being as risque and fabulous as she is, then I can wear them sitting in my office at my desk. But that could also be the part of me that thinks Dakota Johnson is the most perfect human being in the entire world.\n\n As far as a side by side comparison to the book, there were a few semi-important scenes left out, and a few things were different, but overall it stands up next to its literary counterpart pretty well. I know most people hate these movies and love to laugh at them, or do like my sister and watch them on Crappy Movie Monday, but I can't help but love them. I will watch it again, and I will revel in its terrible glory all over again.\n\nhttps://lifeofanavidmoviegoer.wordpress.com",

The reason I've given it such a high rating (well, a high rating for the Fifty Shades franchise), is because this film gives you exactly what you think you're going to get. I've read the books, but didn't fully enjoy them. When I finally caved and watched Fifty Shades of Grey, there were very few redeeming qualities to what was supposed to be an accurate on-screen depiction. In Fifty Shades Darker, however, the cast and director seemed to have not taken themselves quite as seriously. Generally, the depiction in relation to the original book is rather faithful, and there are some genuinely amusing moments that the last fim was certainly lacking.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nIf you do not enjoy the franchise, this film is not going to change your mind. However, if you were iffy on the previous film, and expected more in relation to the books, you may enjoy this one.\n\nBig-Screen, Buy-It, Rent-It, Pass?\nRent-It.",

Nope, no discoloration.  It is fifty shades darker on the brilliance color wheel from almost every other film created.  I feel like this is a bunch of alternate plots that the author stole from other stories that she liked, but she doesn't have the wit or the creativity to make this story her own.  Undeveloped plot lines, great costumes, spectacular Jamie Dornan body shots, the sex following each dramatic even like an orgasmic apostrophe to mark each occasion. Christian went from powerful looking to scruffy looking....Anna went from shy and scruffy to coiffed and empowered.  \n\nThe beginning started out with a stronger, more demanding heroine, yet rarely were her standards met.  Not a great deal of back story on Christian developed.  The whole movie had the Mrs. Robinson story-line going but the lack of resolution early on by Christian shows that he has a weakness of character when he's without a contract dictating the terms of this level of dominance over his slave.\n\nI wanted to say this had some redeeming qualities, but I'm hard up to find any.  Even the sex was a bit stale.  \n\nI'll give kudos to the set designer and the costume designer.  I really do think the actors and actresses did the best they could with what they had.",

Or was the intended demographic really all moms as claimed by some? I mean, I was there (granted to judge) and so were a surprising amount of men who werent exactly dragged there. By this logic it shouldnt be surprising Fifty Shades Darker is beating Lego Batman and John Wick.\nBut to me it sure is shocking. \nYes, it is directed by James Foley (Glengary Glenn Ross) to prove one movie doesnt get you respect...or self respect for that matter. And the star is the granddaughter of Tippi Hedren, here to prove that talent isnt part of genetics. \nWhat else is there to say. Can we blame them for such bad writing when the book came from a BlackBerry? Can you believe we have met a couple less likable than Bella and Edward? On the plus side, at least they dont look as uncomfortable as they did in the first movie.\nBut in the end, I'm willing to bet that when PornHub makes a parody of Fifty Shades Darker, it will probably recieve more critical acclaim than the original.",

Although Jamie Dornan never did anything for me, whatever appeal he may have had in Fifty Shades fizzled in Darker.  His persona and acting had the charisma and appeal of an ironing board.  Trying to get beyond the lack of appeal that Dornan has overall, his attempts to look or act sexy fell flat.  The overall plot was choppy, and the acting was third rate- I've seen better in high school plays.  The story line veered so much from the book that it was laughable.  My biggest regrets in seeing this movie were 1) $ wasted, 2) now whenever I re-read the books I see the faces of Johnson and Dornan instead of the originally imagined characters.  If you have not already seen this, don't waste your time.  It was a FLOP, which is very disappointing as I was a huge fan of the books.",

            "content": "Where Are \"Hearts & Flowers\"?\n\nTwo years ago, Universal Pictures agreed to display the preceding unreasoning erotic-romance adaptation thought up by British E. L. James, such recklessness led to a storm of dissimilar opinions between movie critics and audience, however, and deplorably the most transcendental for the film production company, was a rotund monetary attainment, not only in its homeland but in the whole world, in part by its relentless readers and partly by its strategic launch date.Valentine's day is the picked day for releasing Jamie Dornan' and Dakota Johnson's sadomasochistic fair tale. Numerous are irrational alterations within this sequel, nonetheless, the germination of all these changes lies in its hard directional shift, as Taylor-Wood hand her director chair (within allowable boundaries) over to the filmmaker of some episodes of well-liked TV series such as \"House of Cards\" or \"Billions\", James Foley.\n\nEven though \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" wasn't well-received by most film critics, one of the most relevant swaps with the original novel was the very light but pertinent conversion in Anna's identity, the main female role. On the pages, she's fragile, more naive and more permissive; on the other hand, her effigy on screen is romantic but self-reliant, a suffragist but submissive woman, and although her mission about women's empowerment did not work, it gives something moderately axiomatic away from denigrated trilogy of James. That is probably the main conflict of the latest installment, the austere and fussy accuracy to the reference book. This time, the intrepid woman who opposed the selfsame creator has gone, foolishly, Niall Leonard, Mitchell's husband, writes and sketches empty, futile and even squalid contingencies and characters.\n\n-\"Ana\"; -\"Christian\", the metal and heavy elevator door closes tenaciously. This was the unbreathable and astute ending of the initial film, leaving the protagonist in floods of tears, thinking every day about him and trying to start over. The motion picture in question takes place ridiculously three weeks after what has happened, and I say \"ridiculous\" by unconnected and soporific distortions between the leading roles; in just three weeks, Mr. Grey suddenly forgets his firm sexual priorities to become into the authentic submissive of the storyline, in which Anastasia Steele looks more experienced, more libidinous and superficially more greedy. Fallible resolutions go on in the hands of three idle and anodyne antagonists, who covet to fracture the happy new relationship, at the same time that Grey struggles with his intrinsic shades of yesterday and today.\n\n\"Darker\", this is evidently the wrong term. Even the film opens with an involuntary self-parody about its suggestive title, are some alba roses too dark? Such name is only one tactic more in order to insinuate improving previous flaws, however, the only thing that they get is to underline them with darker ink.\n\nLeonard and Foley are a dangerous duo for the romance genre, and this should not be taken as a compliment. On this occasion, they coat it a dismal, unsatisfactory and unfounded thriller aroma; a series of circumstances poorly posed, developed and resolved. How is it possible that after being on the brink of death, he just wants to have more sex?. Besides, new characters inclusion is simply execrable, providing irregular performances, with traces of university film and a limited runtime on screen for revealing their talents, wasted time in close-ups of the main leads looking each other in the eyes.\n\nDespite the unfathomable dissatisfaction I felt, there is another portion which we can praise. The first one, openly, is its protagonist. Although Johnson can't save all the footage, she does not allow her character from drowning in that sea of insipidness and boredom, on the other hand, gives it a particular empathy. Another satisfactory feature is the partial revelation of Christian's dismal past, even accompanied by flashbacks, hence he achieved a longer participation, showing his fascinating acting talent for those minds that still watching \"The Fall\" by BBC Two.\n\nIn technical aspects, we can see major improvements within staging with regard to the previous film, with soft but amended erotic overtures, that even if they do not reach the expected level of arousal, it delivers elaborated challenges. Likewise, fireworks, masks, sex toys, parties, restaurants, Grey's remodeled penthouse and the usual Seattle aerial shots are perceived differently due to their nocturnal and attractive tones. Like its predecessor, sound support is vital both harmonizing the sensual shots and decorating fickle moments. Although the dreamlike rhythms of Legend, Sia, Swift or composer Danny Elfman do not convince for another Academy Awards nomination, they fit with complacency within artistically precious scenes, for example, Anastasia walking under the rain.\n\n\"Darker\" destabilizes first movie spectacular expectations due to reduced chemistry of its lead actors, its poorly constructed ambitions and a series of failed elections which lose out the limited potential of James' erotic books. Grey needs to marry, forget his past and be an ordinary boyfriend, reveal his shades; Anastasia wants to be the boss of the publishing house, covets more sex, yearns for redeeming men with psychological problems, now he's who wants flowers and hearts and she wants to fuck hard. An ex-submissive lurking, a stalker boss and a grown up lady try to end the relationship; with its dull ending, \"Darker\" insinuates becoming into a thriller of killers instead of romantic frippery that it should aspire to be.",

            "content": "My idea of a great movie is an old time western, like Tombstone or Stagecoach. I have never been one to gawk over any kind of romance movie. But, I will be honest after watching the first 50 Shades of Grey movie I was quite excited for 50 Shades Darker to come out. I built up a lot of excitement for it over the course of one year, and I was worried that I had built it up too much in my mind. But, after watching 50 Shades Darker it quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. \nPLOT LINE \nI'll be honest, this movies prequel (50 Shades of Grey) seemed to have absolutely no plot line, but that was not the case with this sequel. It had a nice easy to follow plot line that left me on the edge of my theatre chair waiting to see what happens. While it had a lot of similarities to the first movie, 50 Shades Darker had a plot line that made sense, and wasn't just a bunch of random sex scenes. It was rather cute the way Ana Steele (the main female character) and Christian Grey (main male character) found their way back to each other, fall and love and get engaged. The movie also ended with me greatly excited to see the final movie of the trilogy 50 Shades Freed.\n\nSOUND TRACK\nI don't know of anything worse than a movie that has a sound track that make absolutely no sense and doesn't fit the movie at all. The sound track for the movie 50 Shades Darker, could be one of the best fit movie/music pairing I have ever heard. Each scenes song went along perfectly with what was happening. I actually just purchased the sound track on ITunes because I enjoyed it so much. My favorite song in the movie was I Don't Want to Live Forever by Taylor Swift and Zayn.\nACTING \nIn 50 Shades of Grey I thought the acting was very comical. Both lead characters in the first movie looked very rehersed and ridged, but in 50 Shades Darker the lead rolls looked very comfortable and natural. Both characters also looked like a very good fit for the roll they were playing. Both seemed to have good chemistry with one another which made watching the movie even more enjoyable. The characters that played a smaller role in the movie also seemed to do a better job on this second go around. Seeing how all the acting skills have improved this time, I cannot wait to see what is going to happen in the third film. \nTIME LENGTH\nThere are always those movies that seem to be way to painfully long, and the other that feel like you blinked and it was over. 50 Shades Darker felt like it was a great combination of both. The movie ran close to 2 hours long, and did not seem like it went on forever or like it was too short. The movies perfect length also made it very easy to stay interested in what was happening in the movie. They also did a good job getting to the point, it didn't take a long time to beat around the bush about what was happening. \n\nMODESTY \nI grew up in an incredibly modest household. I never thought I would enjoy watching a movie like 50 Shades Darker, especially after seeing the first one. The first movie seemed to have just weird random sex scenes every 10 minutes which become very awkward and unnecessary. This movie however, seemed to have mellow down on those and up its modesty. Yes, it still had a lot of intimacy, but they seemed to be a lot more taste full about it and made it seem way more meaningful then they did in the first movie.",

The acting is much better with more chemistry. The music is great and it fits the scenes like a glove. The new look of Jamie is way hotter with that scruff and Ana's one is great too.\nNow a big WARNING FOR SPOILERS :\nI fell in love with all of scenes, they were well made without missing the essential elements of the story from the book. I loved the scene with Ana, Leila and Christian.. It was wonderful and how Leila knelt and the acting was very good but I wanted it to be longer even though I know they had to put many events with a limited time.\nThe intimate scenes were very sexy and sensual with the suiting music, it was very beautiful. Now, what I didn't like was apart from the scene when  Christian goes into the submissive mode and how Ana reacted, it was missing something.. I wanted more from him and her, more reactions and emotions. Apart from this it was just perfect for me as reader of the books.\nAn advice for those who haven't watched it yet, never listen and judge before seeing it, give it a try and the decide. The movie is excellent and more than enough for the fans of  the books. Well done !!",

I would never in my life sacrifice a second to read these books, but out of curiosity I want to watch the movies. The thing is there is nothing there that can support a whole movie, needless to say 3 of them. There's no real plot, no real story, no action, nothing. Yet people are driven to the cinemas to watch a BDSM \"romance\". Well, this movie was no BDSM, no romance and nor was it sexy enough. There are movies out there with a single sex scene between the protagonists and it's much more steamier than the whole of this movie. Random moments that were supposed to be dramatic never managed to deliver, there was one point were the tension they were building to was diffused in an eye-blick, every choice they took, every positive step forward, they made a leap backwards. Dakota Johnson really waisted her potential with this movie, I can see her starring in something more demanding. Dornan on the other hand is really struggling with this, the way he's delivering his lines sounds hilarious. It doesn't matter though cause at the end I entertained myself making fun of the movie, and it served its purpose in its weird way. It's making a lot of mine, so everyone is happy and we can all pretend this never happened, till the time comes when the last installment is out, and we will go and watch it again.

I wonder if that's what their attraction to this abortion of series is? Most empowered women seem to lose the silly childhood fantasy of fixing the attractive but damaged man. Since that type doesn't look twice at the people in this fan base, I'm guessing they never got that phase out of their system in college, thus allowing it to continue into their adult lives. Please stop giving these peopl you money and encouraging this \"fantasy\" *cough* left over daddy issues! *cough* Seriously though, this is how women end up with guys who beat them. I'm mean, unless that's what they really want. I think that's my take away from this. I should start beating more of my dates. Dominating them early and turning them into my new house keepers. How many people can sleep in a 10x10? I could comfortably beat 10 or 12 people a day and have and extra bedroom. Thank you Hollywood and silly fan fatties for green-lighting abuse.",

Starting from the first minutes, it seems like the director is rushing somewhere without giving additional details. 10 minutes of some serious stuff, sex scene, 10 minutes of kind of meaningful conversations, sex scene - that's how all the film is structured. One thing I do want to praise the crew for is the relative subtleness of the sex scenes. They were embarrassing and awkward to watch but at least not intolerably long.
