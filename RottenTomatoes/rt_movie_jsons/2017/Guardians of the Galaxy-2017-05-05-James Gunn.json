This retains the colorful, imaginative cinematography from the first. the special effects are very well done though some of the final fight between Russel and Pratt can be a bit shotty. The music & acting overall are as good as the first with some really fun characters and a very good villain. The only minor problem is the humor is more prevalent here and they double down on it a lot to mostly positive results. However, sometimes it doesn't work that well and scenes can drag a bit because of it but for the most part 70% of the jokes really work and the rest aren't bad as much just fall flat except for the stupid Pac-Man joke at the end. The pacing is still very good though and the editing is very good although the story in the middle with Rocket and Yondu while important to the plot feels like they focus a bit too long on their story at times. Overall though those minor complaints don't take away from recommending everyone should see this once just like the first. It's a really fun and creative sequel.",

It's funny how this movie is extremely bright and colourful and has so much comedy ended so sadly. \n\nDrax do you have any tape?\n\nThis movie is extremely bright and colourful, it has over the top effects, and it has alot of comes. The\u00a0story\u00a0is very different because even though\u00a0Ego\u00a0is affecting other\u00a0planets, the main battle happened inside an uninhibited\u00a0planet, and it's ending was very big. \nThe\u00a0cinematography\u00a0was absolutely amazing, and the\u00a0score\u00a0was really engaging especially the\u00a0sound\u00a0effects, but was it just me or the score wasn't that amazing for the final battle at the\u00a0end\u00a0and mostly relies on sound effects. \n\nDid you ask Nebula?",

The line 'He was your father but i was always your daddy' from Yondu sounds comical but means so much for this movie. The action scenes were great but a bit of cringey writing ruins this movie from must but i see this as a much needed upgrade from the first instalment.",

This time Peter has accidently meeted his real father from other planet. After Ego(Peter's father)  has told to Peter about himself and about his plans, Peter with his friends have understood, that Ego is one of the most danderous of villains in the universe and his plans  can have terrible consequences for universe. The Guardians of galaxy vol.2 is very realistic Thanks to technologies, which Marvel studios used. Other stars, planets, aliens and starships is fancy and look as if they were real. Also the movie has a very good humor which can understand Both an adult and a child. Also in the cast there is of my favourite actors. It's Chris Pratt. I'm really enjoying his character. I really reccomend this movie for all Marvel fans.",

Like as was said with 'Guardians of the Galaxy', is it as amazing as the IMDb rating (which is something that really shouldn't be taken to heart and is often blown out of proportion here on IMDb) and ecstatic reviews suggest? To me, not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' well made and entertaining? Absolutely.\n\nA couple of the gags fall a little flat and the film does drag in the middle act. That's pretty much it for the complaints however.\n\n'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2', reiterating what was said in my review for the first film due to having the same strengths, boasts spectacular special effects, gorgeously psychedelic colours, slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic, really making the toes tap. The action is beautifully edited, choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating, there's plenty of it without feeling too much.\n\nJames Gunn directs with style and a sure hand, always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at. Both 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films are far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction are in them as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' was written too, most of the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart.\n\nThe story is mostly energetic and compelling, let down only by some of the middle act. At least however it doesn't have as many random misplaced moments and over sentimentality, even if it's not exactly original (not that that is a desperately bad thing).\n\nCharacters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging, with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character, but it's adorable and hilarious Baby Groot, scene-stealing Rocket and touchingly conflicted Yondu steal the show.\n\nOnce again, like in the first film, Chris Pratt is highly charismatic, Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery, Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable, Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Baby Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out, being a sheer delight as Rocket. Kurt Russell is an enigmatic presence and Michael Rooker is quite touching as Yondu.\n\nIn conclusion, a lot of fun and very well made, every bit as good as the first, a few flat jokes and draggy middle aside. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This film is definitely a step-up from the first installment as the story is just so much better. James Gunn really poured a lot into this movie which led to such an amazing film. The overall message of the movie is so beautiful and offers so many iconic moments. The film always has something going on and a lot of the story details never get lost in other plots. Some aspects of the film are a tiny bit complicated, but it doesn't hurt the movie all that much. A large reason why this movie feels a lot more whole is that the characters are way better developed here. Peter's story excels greatly into something really beautiful. I would even say the same about Yondu as in the first film, Yondu didn't feel all that important. This film, however, made me greatly appreciate Yondu and his actions in the first film. Rocket, Gamora, and Nebula also get some more character development that I think benefited them greatly. Even new characters like Ego and Mantis were very easy to attach some type of connection to as they are both very well developed. The only character I would say is poorly written is Drax, which sucks because I really liked Drax in the first film. Drax came off as rude and annoying for a large part of the film and his jokes weren't all that funny this time around. As much as I loved the characters in this film from a story standpoint, the actors weren't all that great. Both Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana do a poor job in their roles. Their line delivery is off some of the time and I never felt the energy their performances had in the first film. Plus, both actors never convinced me that they had a love connection forming. Another actor that struggled was Dave Bautista. He was sometimes trying too hard to sell his joke or line that it came off in a cringeworthy way. However, the rest of the cast was pretty solid. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job just like in the first film and new additions to the franchise Kurt Rusell and Pom Klementieff do an awesome job with both really nailing down the personalities of their characters. Michael Rooker is the stand-out to me in this film. Rooker had some great line delivery and really made the message of the film feel powerful and impactful. The production design of this film was flawless. Everything looked so stunning and the design of Ego's planet was just so well done. The color choices were great and how the technology on the planet moved was just so cool to watch. However, the cinematography felt a little weaker in this film. It was still very good, but I don't think cinematographer Henry Braham really made any shots look visually breathtaking like Ben Davis did in the first film.  Something that did improve was the score. It was better than in the first one with Tyler Bates creating some memorable tracks and more of a balance between songs and the score. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was definitely a step-up storywise, but somewhat of a step-down when looking at some of the cast. Even though I do like this film better than the first one, I do think the cast was a lot better in the first installment rather than the second. However, the strong, heartfelt story really hides all the casts' flaws and really sets this film over the top. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",

            "content": "The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot of insanity and a fair amount of heart -- this Sequel has a fair amount of insanity and a lot of heart.  And I really mean it - much of the movie does ask that you feel \"this is funny\" or \"this is cool\", but there are numerous parts where the movie make you feel Mortified, Triumphant or even legitimately Sad.  The final few minutes of the movie before the credits roll are absolutely spellbinding, and I literally tear-up every time I watch the final act of this movie.  The final act is both Inspiring and then Heartbreaking shortly afterwards, and the fact that a Marvel movie has, upon multiple viewings, brought me to tears really shows how outstanding this film is.  Like many, I would've liked a bit more insanity, but this is EASILY the Second Most Insane movie of the MCU (part 1 being the #1 spot), and since the trade-off was genuine emotional impact, I am more than happy with the exchange we got.  If you love movies that cover a wide spectrum of emotions and does so effectively, then Guardians of the Galaxy 2 might be the best movie to do so in a very long time.  You will laugh, you will cheer, your heartrate will occasionally rise and you will end it having had your soul crushed.  In terms of pure entertainment and emotional impact and satisfaction, I'd argue this might be the best Space Opera since The Empire Strikes Back - yes, I really mean that.",

            "content": "GotG Vol. 2 isn't quite as good as its predecessor, but even though it does fall into the \"sequel is worse\" category, it still remains a solid and entertaining MCU blockbuster and comes close enough to the original to be enjoyable. The script doesn't have the finesse of the first movie causing the humor to drag and be a little over the top at points, but the actors do a fine job of getting around this causing a few of these moments to be genuinely funny. It's nice that this movie takes us deeper into the character of Peter Quill by exploring his family, a route that was set up well at the end of Guardians 1. What's even better about this is watching how Peter learning about and discovering his true family impacts his relationship with his \"new\" family: his fellow Guardians. This impact adds some emotional depth to the film, and makes Peter Quill a surprisingly complex character and takes him through a really nice arc that forces him to truly consider his relationships with those he cares about the most. Pratt supplements this with another great performance as the character, and his fellow Guardians castmates hit the spot as well. The movie makes sure to make good use of Kurt Russell as Ego by giving him plenty of screen time, a backstory, and a few emotional moments of his own. It also kicked ass to see the true power and capabilities of Yondu's flying arrow, something we got a taste of in the first movie but was amplified substantially in this movie. It's also still a relief and breath of fresh air that this film has no connection to the Avengers and the rest of the cinematic universe other than us knowing that it's a part of it. As mentioned before, what really prevents this movie from reaching the heights of GotG 1 for me is the humor, since even with the acting the script hampers this movie's ability to be as funny as GotG 1. GotG 2 is nonetheless still a fun and entertaining movie and is sure to leave viewers satisfied as the credits roll.",

            "content": "After the release of Infinity War, I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with everyone before Endgame comes. And of course I was watching them all very hurriedly. The memorable movies were the ones that I still remember very clearly to date (it's been nearly 3 years), while the ones that were terrible and a drag to watch, I forgot them instantly. I'd say this movie comes between the two categories, and as far as I can think right now, it's the only one to be in this exceptional category.\n\nNo matter what everyone says, I absolutely hate baby Groot. Cuteness only suits on creatures we are used to perceiving as cute. And thus Groot, a tree, looks very, very awkward with those chubby cheeks. It seems as though that face wasn't meant to be on that body. Also the entire point of his innocence is very irritating, especially the part where he wanted to use Rocket's buttons in spite of him repeatedly telling him not to do it. That scene does not even make any sense, since other than that part Rocket and Groot seem to understand each other literally all the time. Groot becomes stupid or intelligent, strong or weak as the story demands it, which is why I absolutely hate him.\n\nThe visuals are absolutely gorgeous. Though it feels as though there is too much yellow in the colour palette and the overall tone is more inclined towards the warm shades, the CGI world is marvelous to look at. Ego is a great planet to look at. I have seen Ego in the comics now so I can't believe they were actually able to translate him so well on the screen. Seeing the spaceship battles always kept me on the edge of my seat. It's just like how I was expecting the movie to become better as time progresses.\n\nBut the way the conflict between Peter and Ego came was very bad. First of all, the way they bonded was wrong by their characteristics. Peter is a gullible guy who always thinks by his emotions while Gamora is the sensible one. Yet here Peter was the one suspecting Ego while Gamora wanted him to trust Ego. And then the way Ego revealed his mother's death, ugh! Why did he even need to say that! Firstly no matter how much you are in a flow, you'd never say something like that. And secondly if he knows so much about Peter, how did he not know saying that would make him angry?\n\nI really liked Mantis. I never understood why her character arc was about her being ugly. She looked way better than Nebula or Drax. She was kinda cute though. I couldn't hear any of Drax's jokes so I won't be talking about him. Yondu was also a very nice character. As much as I rolled my eyes seeing him in the movie, I really enjoyed seeing what he had become. His character development is fantastic, because of the redeemed person that he is. His whistling and shooting arrows was very much fun to watch.\n\nOverall this movie is a very mixed bag of opinions for me. I think it's really bad compared to the first movie, but at the same time really entertaining compared to most MCU movies. There is so much CGI, so much world building in GotG that I can't possibly hate it. I'm just gonna try to remember this one. I had forgotten everything about it except the good scenes, so I had to watch the Cinemasins video to remember it. I hope Volume 3 surpasses my expectations.",

They are both good in a lot of ways and they both have a lot of flaws in a lot of ways. So let's get the flaws out of the way. For me the problem with this movie is how they handle Drax. For me I feel like they could've developed Drax a tad bit better. He has some really good moments with Mantis, and he can be pretty funny through most of it, but honestly sometimes he can get kinda annoying with his laugh but sometimes the laugh works. Another problem that I have with this movie is that some of it could be cut down just a little bit, and there are a few scenes that kinda feel like they don't have to be there. But otherwise. This movie rocks. I really like the history between Quill and his father. The relationship between Gamora and Nebula was really interesting, and as I said earlier some of the scenes between Drax and Mantis were really good. But by far my favorites scenes to watch are between Rocket and Yandu. These characters were so engaging. Just their history just really interest me and somewhat moved me. They were hands down my favorite parts of watching the film. I also thought Ego was much more of an interesting villain than Ronan. All in all Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not perfect but still a really good movie. I don't think that I'll ever have a favorite between these but for me I'm kinda leading towards Guardians of the Galaxy but at the end there are stuff that I really like in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but I guess I'll never know which movie that I prefer. 8.5/10",

(The cast is great across the board.) I appreciate how much this feels like a natural extension of the first. So rarely do films and their character arcs have such clear progression.\n\nThere are a couple issues I had. It felt like Drax (Dave Bautista) was dumbed down. Also, I like new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff), but there is the issue of the changes to her character in comparison to the original comics. Writer and director James Gunn has a fondness for making big changes to comic characters. Usually that works. Here, however, here we have a martial artist female hero transformed into a meeker, more reactive-than-proactive character; problematic.\n\nThe whole thing looks great. The first film was distinctive, but this one raises the bar. The sci-fi designs are colorful and creative. The CGI in this is amazing. Really, I think this one of the greatest visual attempts in film. James Gunn's direction and incorporation of classic songs works so well.\n\nOverall, I can't stress how good this is. I highly recommend.",

Drax and Mentis just starting their weird relation.\n\nGamora & Nebula's bonding thickens with fantastic toxic sister-sister relationships were explored. Peters relationship with his Father, being set up as a alien in first movie got good continuity and explains a lot more about Peter getting kidnapped by Ravengers. Peter at last playing ball with his father. Peter taking quick reaction of shooting his father just as he hear about tumor, Peter can't control his emotion.\n\nYondu is the best daddy, his arc and redemption felt so emotional with original Ravengers returning to celebrate that beautiful funeral, heads off to the CGI department.

            "content": "Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2, directed, once again, by James Gunn, wasn't quite the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it still packed a nice punch! James Gunn brings back his unorthodox style to this film, not paying off as well as the first, but still stands out as one of the better films of the MCU. I enjoyed Gunn's approach, by making this a grounded, character driven sequel, while also keeping the first addition in continuity, but by doing that, he created one too many subplots, leaving some things a little underdeveloped and choppy. Gunn utilized the same tones as the first film, while also recharging that emotional tone, but he seemed to try to throw in an extra dose of humor, and it threw the tones off in most occasions. One issue this film had that the first film didn't, was it's pace. For almost the entire first act, it was tough to see where things were going; it just felt like another Guardians film. When the second act hits, that's when it slows down, but we get great layers to all of our main characters. When the final act hits, that's where it starts to feel like a Marvel film, having big action sequences, and great chemistry between the characters.\n\nOne of the best things that James Gunn did for this film, was not only flesh out all of the characters, but give them such a grounded tone, being able to mesh with the other Avengers seamlessly. With this film being centered around Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, again, we were able to dig deeper into his back story, and discover a lot of great layers to his character. He had so much to do, carrying the load on his shoulders, leaving him with the best character arch of the film. Zoe Sladana returns as Gamora, and she absolutely kills it this time! With her character being involved with a drastic plot point, it left her character to be fleshed out more, while becoming more grounded than before. Karen Gillan as Nebula got a lot more to do this time around, really giving herself, and Gamora the extra excitement and importance they both needed. We really didn't get too much more on Drax, played by Dave Bautista, but every time that man opens his mouth, it's comedy gold! With the nice addition of Mantis, played by Pom Klementieff, it helped flesh his character out, subtly. Michael Rooker as Yondu, is the MAN! He gets so much more to do this time around, fleshing his character out nicely. His character is just so well written, allowing for great character moments. With Groot being pushed to the side, it allowed for Rocket Racoon, played by Bradley Cooper, to gain a tremendous bond with Yondu. The banter between these two characters was absolutely gut-busting! Rocket also has one of the better character archs of the film, fleshing his character out more, while keeping that charm everyone loves. I'm a fan of Kurt Russell, and I really liked him in the MCU, but the writters didn't give him enough space to breath, and be Kurt Russell. Even though he has one of the best back stories for a villain, while also posing a real threat, his character development was predictable. If James Gunn let him do his thing, I feel as if this film could've benefited from that Kurt Russell charisma. The issue this film had, it tried too incorporate too many villains, making everyone underdeveloped, and a waste of potential.\n\nGuardians 2 didn't rely on the action like the first film, but the few times it's there, it's super exciting, well shot, and backed up with immaculate effects. This is one of the MCU's best looking films.\n\nYou didn't think that they would make a sequel and not absolutely kill it on the soundtrack again, did you? James Gunn and Tyler Bates came together once more to create another amazing soundtrack, that enhanced the emotion and tention in each scene.\n\nOverall, even though James Gunn ran into a few more issues than the first, he still managed to create a real fun experience!",

            "content": "I think this is the most overrated MCU movie. It is a lot like Age of Ultron: a major disappointment after the first movie, which was amazing. The difference is Age of Ultron is underrated with an underrated villain while this movie is overrated with a way overrated villain. One of the big problems with this movie is that the humor failed. It tried to be as funny as the first Guardians but it just wasn't as funny even though there were more jokes, because the humor just didn't work. Mantis and Nebula are bland. Mantis is just a useless character used for exposition and comic relief. Nebula feels like a cheap, knock off, less interesting version of Loki. I don't buy her turn at all. Still, if those were the only issues, I would've still liked this movie. The main issue is the villains. It had too many first of all. We had the Sovereign, Taserface, and Ego. The Sovereign is the main antagonist for the First Act. They shouldn't even be villains as they are actually victims of Rocket's personality. Then, we have Taserface, who is slightly better than the Sovereign, as he actually feels like a villain and his interactions with Rocket are hilarious. And now, the biggest and most overrated villain, Ego. Ego is right up there with Whiplash for wasted potential. He's supposed to be the main villain, but he isn't even a villain for the first one and a half hours (yes, that's actually the exact minute mark that he becomes the villain.) Ego is not built up well at all in the movie. And the twist hardly feels like a twist, as it was kinda obvious he was going to be the villain. If they wanted to do a big twist, it would have worked better if Ego had been evil the whole time, and the twist is that he's Peter's father. They could've made the Sovereign work for Ego, and he's been trying to find Star-Lord, and at the beginning, the Sovereign find Peter and unknown to the Guardians, tell Ego. The theme of family being more than blood would still work. The only reason Ego is not completely boring is that he's played by Kurt Russell. All that being said, the movie does have its redeeming factors. Yondu's arc is really well done. His relationship with Peter is easily the best part of the movie. He has an amazing Mary Poppins moment, and his interactions with Rocket are also really enjoyable. Yondu is probably the one reason that I don't dislike this movie, and think its okay.",

I feel this one is worst than the first sadly. \n\nI felt shocked seeing Yondu killing 100 persons so easily and without regret. He was serial killer and I felt no regret about seeing him for. That moment really lost me. I really wanted to like this movie, but due to that the emotional core failed\ud83d\ude2d.  \n\nPart of the problem is that the Empire Strikes Back, which for all the 80's shameless references. This movie and the previous are afraid to reference Star Wars; which is weird considering the whole Darth Vader is Gamora's father and another sorta Darth Vader is Star Lord's father. I feel they should had stick to one single Darth Vader, if they wanted the movie to be about it they should had done it about Thanos and Gamora, because this feels like a side story that a sequel is damned to sorta remake. Another reason is that well Luke Skywalker love redeemed his father instead of killing him in cold blood; which is what this movie does with Star Lord killing his father in cold blood. You remember that outburst of rage in Return of the Jedi where Luke almost, almost falls to the Dark Side by almost killing his father Darth Vader? Well is exactly what Star Lord does, he literally just kills his father in a heavily emphasized rage outburst (it would had been excusable as self-defense if the characters hadn't been plotting how to kill him like a whole night before).\n\nSure they sorta try to make a point about that rage outburst in Avengers' Infinity War but the point of the matter is that even considering that, like Ironman anger rage outburst; neither of the 2 characters is shown to learn anything. Both live happily ever after without learning anything at all to solve his main internal conflict; because they are never shown solving it. That's what makes George Lucas creation of Luke Skywalker so unique as a character (and yes introducing a parent figure and killing it on the same movie is a huge mistake J.J. Abrams repeated from this movie on a Star Wars movie; even if that movie showed it in self-defense).\n\nI really wasn't fond of baby Groot either, in part due to him being a revived character, and I dunno too cartoonish designed. Sylvester Stallone cameo felt like it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. In order to not take you out of the movie those people need to have main roles. And yes those Pacman and David Hassselhof jokes in the middle of the end where; well awful. And those godlike powers made it seem even more powerful than Thanos or the Avengers villians up to that point; I hate how Marvel doesn't care about levels of power of villians",

However in doing so, characters like Rocket and Yondu show a more personal side to them which had been hidden away in Volume One. \n\nThis sequels comedy is as good as the first, largely thanks to Dave Bautista's role as Drax, being the main source of comic relief.\n\nWhat lets this sequel down is the story, it is important to establish the true origin of Quill and his father however it just leads to dialogue heavy scenes where not much happens. Most of the characters are at their strongest when they're together so when separated the individual characters just don't attract as much care.\n\nIf the group wasn't split up, this would be on par with its predecessor as the humour is as good as the first, some characters are better this time around, but it doesn't feel like the team up movie fans wanted.",

Absolutely every one of the main characters had me crying out from beneath my 3D glasses throughout. The emotion is rich, relatable and raw and I appreciated it. I mean just the way the movie ends and the interconnectivity of all the plot machinations are warranted and welcome. \nThe effects, battles, and shooting never felt rushed or cheap. Everything fired on all cylinders with a care and love throughout. The plot was personal and minimal as it should be and the way it was made global was sensible and simple. The stakes couldn't have been higher because they were personal and they didn't need a sky portal to do it. \nEven the references I didn't get were welcome little injokes rather than complete set ups for other movies that played in to the tone of the movie. Mantis is excellent and Drax is almost the most hilarious which is saying something. The pacing and the structure of the battles were coherent and made creative use of everyday new skill sets. The film had me in stitches throughout and the potential of Volume 3 and the next iteration of Groot is certainly an appealing one. \nThe depth effects of the 3D, after he litany of terrible post conversions I've seen, was consistent, pleasurable throughout and extraordinary well done and for one actually enhanced the experience.\nThis film should be added to the annals of time as the exact right kind of blockbuster sequel that builds upon its predecessors shoulders to create something unique and memorable that was both economical, brisk and yet deep and seemingly never compromised.",

Everyone gets a descent amount of character development but the story is mainly focused on Quill and Ego. Yondu finally redeems himself in a satisfying way and keeps many scenes interesting. This movie is by no means perfect, it does have its fair share of flaws. But almost the entire film is filled with an exciting and funny storyline which does an amazing job at keeping its audience invested. 9/10, it can't compete with many other great movies but it certainly deserves recognition. Definitely something I'd be willing to rewatch.",
