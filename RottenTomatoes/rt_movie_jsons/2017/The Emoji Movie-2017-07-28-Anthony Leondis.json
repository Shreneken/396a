Despite the obstacles, big and small, the characters in the movie, as well as the viewers, still meet a great end. The performances from T.J Miller & James Corden illustrate the narrative of this movie with such a viable effort. Consequently, this film ended up being as Beautiful as it is.\n\nThe Emoji Movie intertwined visuals, audio, and plot in a very Amazing way.\n\nIt was as if Tony Leondis combined the characters, the setting, and the valued objects within the film and then threw them into a mixing bowl to create a giant serving of great Spaghetti. As a viewer, chewing and pondering on the quality of my Spaghetti, I couldn't help but think about how sweet it tasted. The flavors of the film blended so great-ly that I considered getting a(n) Bird for emotional support!\n\nThis story of having real friends is more important than being popular, and that good friends will help out even when things are hard. is a triumphant effort on Tony Leondis's part in making viewers weep with joy.\n\nOverall, I found The Emoji Movie to be Amazing, Stunning, and Beautiful!

This is not your typical comedy movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. \n\nThe film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with James Corden, Patrick Stewart, and T.J Miller in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Patrick Stewart once again proves utterly breathtaking as \"Poop\". Further proving that \"Poop\" is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century.\n\nThe action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear.",

            "content": "To be honest, I saw The Emoji Movie only to understand why it gets so much hate. As a Redditor I understand why I am supposed to hate this movie (because...emojis?), but why does the normie audience hate it? Isn't this movie supposed to be like, their dream come true? Don't they always keep spamming emojis in all their sentences when writing a message or making a meme? When the movie hadn't come out it was being advertised a lot, so I thought people are supposed to be excited. Even the animation of this movie seemed really good. But I watched it and now I know the problem.\nThe Emoji Movie is very ignorant. It talks about emojis as if it is supposed to be something very cool. In reality only elders, women and children use emojis when they message (because they are the only ones we can't slap some sense into). But then again the target audience here is the children. So considering this movie is from their point of view, emojis are supposed to be shown as though they mean a lot to them. So let's come to the second point. The emojis are shown to have their entire personality revolving around their expression. Why can't they just be doing their job? Also how come so many emojis look similar? Is it like only one of them goes to the emoji keyboard while the others have no business? There are so many questions that the movie doesn't answer.\nI don't know which problem plagues this movie the most. Is it the product placement? No, it just gives a feeling of adventure. None of the product placement looks as much on the nose as everyone describes. Like in TVF Originals they straight up speak out to advertise the things. Here at least Gene and Hi-5 are going to those places to see what is happening over there. I kinda found the Candy Crush part funny and relaxing at the same time. There was also the Just Dance part, and that was definitely cringy. But that was the only cringy one. Facebook, Skype, Drop Box - everything else was quite decent.\nThe jokes weren't half as bad, considering this is aimed for kids. Even I used to make many poop jokes when I was 13. If there even was anything bad, the animation and music compensated for it. The idea that there are so many emojis that we can establish and entire world using it is actually something I'm guessing everyone must have thought at some point. The one part that I surely felt was cringy was when the kid gets to ask out his crush because he sent her a custom emoji. Only if life functioned that easily. Hi-5 was also pretty disgusting. Every time he kept his hand (thumb) down it used to hurt me. Imagine bending your thumb down that much. Also when he ate the salivated candy I felt like vomiting.\nThe Emoji Movie is a bad movie, yes, but it's still better than many animated movies I have seen. Food Fight, Delhi Safari, Roadside Romeo, Geng: The Adventure Begins, Pangaa Gang, the entire Super Bheem series - there are plenty of examples of animated movies that are even worse than this. It does have redeeming qualities, even if they are not enough to make this a genuinely good movie. I can imagine the animators must have worked hard on this movie even if they didn't agree with the script. And that is the reason why I have massive respect for them.",

It would have been better if they put parodies of the apps, so it was not so obvious, but the plot could still be simple and boring.\n\nRe cheap copy of the concept of goodies and great movies like intensely, wrecking ralph, toy story, the Lego movie. Nothing recommended. He does not give good messages, he only treats children like fools, he makes his audience believe that everything in life revolves around social networks, it seems that the only purpose of this thing is to encourage the chamitos to spend 24 hours of the year stuck in a cell phone.\n\nThe human protagonist does the most ridiculous thing in the world: believing that his cell phone is bustling him, instead of just turning it off or putting it on silent mode, he decides to erase everything. And the fact that he tries to conquer the one he likes with pure emojis is absurd. (I would like in real life to draw the attention of the one I like with little faces xd)\n\nHe literally has the girl in front of him, he could tell him by talking and that's it. It seems that in that world all adolescents are stupid, do they not know that there is a real life outside of social networks? That is the epic and serious fail of this publipelicula, as I said before it does not have good messages for the little ones. They just want them to forget reality and live attached to the internet. I really hate that cliche of the typical teenager who prefers networks more than real life.",

However, I was practically clawing my eyes out over the sloppy plot, mostly unlikeable characters, odd dialogue, random plot jumps/jumping to random side plots that have no actual meaning, and mostly forgettable scenes. The only thing the movie had going for it, besides the crap ton of celebrity voice actors (because every single animated kids movie nowadays just don't survive without the celebrity actors), is the animation. It's Sony, the animation is going to be at least somewhat good.\n\nAfter watching this a second time by myself, just to make sure that what I saw the first time wasn't just me having a fever dream, it became very very clear to me that, even with their 50 million dollar budget, something went horribly wrong. Either the animators weren't given enough time (which I doubt because the Emoji Movie took 2 whole years to make), or the writers didn't know how they could make a movie about emojis that would actually work in the box office, which is understandable.\n\nI assume that the Emoji Movie was made to try to appeal to kids or teens by, of course, having emojis as the main characters. But, that was already a big mistake. as my older kid who confirmed that kids and teens nowadays rarely ever use emojis, but rather emoticons. In the movie, the emoticons are referred to as the elderly, which I assume makes enough sense. There's no real way to fix this though, as an animated movie all about emojis or emoticons would still be a huge failure, no matter what.\n\nOverall, this movie was destined to fail the moment it began production. After viewing the movie twice, I thought to myself, 'Man, Hollywood really screwed up this time. I hope they'll be able to fix themselves up down the road.'. I thought that Hollywood would learn their lesson and not do that again, and for the most part, they did! But then, CATS happened. Oh god, was that movie an absolute disaster.

I was disappointed (sorta) not to see more of Patrick Stewart's character, given how much I've heard in recent years; he's barely in it.\n\nIt's a painful watch, even with a run time of just 86 minutes.",

            "content": "Is the first animated Razzie Award winner The Emoji Movie the worst film of the year? Gene (T.J. Miller) is the ‚Äòmeh' emoji inside a kid's iPhone who wants to be a wide variety of expressions. Once he accidentally glitches the phone, he crosses the threshold and exits Textropolis with his band of misfits Hi-5 (James Corden) and Jailbreak (Anna Faris), going through all sorts of Apps like CandyCrush, Just Dance, Spotify, and Dropbox, to escape from the bots hired by Smiler (Maya Rudolph). The obvious message in the film is that technology connects people together, so buy an iPhone and text an emoji to show your love for another. Hearing that flimsy and gimmicky moral, I saw The Emoji Movie as a 90-minute commercial for Sony products, with all the features installed such as a half-baked story, uninspired characters, and obnoxious puns, but colorful imaginative worlds. As for Alex, the phone's owner who sends a text to let go of his comfort zone, he is no Riley from Inside Out. The boy is just as dreadfully boring as all the other phone-ridden schoolmates, including his girl crush, and the apps and emojis don't do much to support his character arc. Also, the film missed an opportunity to have the emojis escape the phone world and enter the WiFi network, where they might accidentally damage the system causing chaos in not just the school but the world. This could have been a unique children's satire tackling the impact of technology among humans. However, The Emoji Movie and Sony exist to only advertise trendy electronics rather than glorifying the art of cinema. (1 ¬Ω Thumbs Down Symbols out of 5)",

I loved the message of the main character, as well, excellent job by the actor. One of my favorite parts is the mechanical or robotic purple/blue-ish dogs. I felt offended by some of the messages in this movie, still, like maybe I wasn't as exciting as Jailbreak or I had problems like the main character presented.

I've done it. Would you be a brother?\nOne of the Princess emojis left the phone altogether.\nNow she lives on the cloud.\nThat is good.\nI'm sure the hacker that helped her do that could easily reprogram you.\nThe name's Jailbreak.\nJailbreak?\nThat's great!

How's that gonna get you anywhere?\nWhat you need are fans.\nThey give you complete and unrelenting support.\nAs long as you're on top.\nPoor Gene.

You want to focus?\nFor your information, I happen to have a sugar addiction,\nand it's a very serious...\nListen, Finger Head!\nWe have to get Gene out of the game without blowing him up.\nI don't want to blow up.\nWe have to match up the candies,\nso that Gene will drop to the bottom.\nAnd we can't match him with any yellows, or else...\nDon't do that. Please don't do that.\nWatch.\nMatch three in a row.\nDon't blow Gene up. Got it.\nAnd we have to be very careful.\n-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful.\n-Candy!\nWatch it!\nHey!\nNo! No, no, no! Slow down.\nNot the yellows! Not the yellows.\nI said careful!\nMy mom just joined Facebook. Can you believe she wanted to friend me?\nHey, Addie, I was just wondering if you are...\nTasty.\nWhat?\nUm... Excuse me?\nSweet.\nHey, Addie!\nHi, Nikki.\nSee you later, Alex.\nSugar Crush.\nSo over this.\nWireless Wireless. How may I help you?\nI'd like to make an appointment.\nIt's like this phone is playing games with me.\nHey, what does this do?\nNo!\nGet me out of here!\nNo! Stop it! Stop, stop!\nIt's not working.\nWell, there's one option left.\nWe line you up with the yellows.\nBut you said not to do that.\nSpecial candies get transported to that jar.\nThe game might think you're a special candy.\nAnd what if it doesn't think I'm a special candy?\nWell...\nJailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak?\nSorry.\nWhat if it doesn't think I'm a special candy?\nI'm not too worried about it.\nOkay, just do it.\nGene!\nGene?\nHey. No!\nGene! You're alive!\nYou were trying to see if I had somehow\nturned into candy, weren't you?\nYes, I was. And you have not.\nHey. Looks like something popped up on Alex's calendar.\nI'm sure it's nothing.\nAlex made an appointment at the phone store.\nNo!\nCalm down, everyone!\nCalm down.\nDon't worry. Everything is fine.\nMaybe Alex just wants to buy some accessories.\nHis appointment is with technical support.\nWell, I'm sure we still have plenty of time to figure this out.\nHis appointment is for tomorrow.\nThen maybe it's just for some routine maintenance.\nActually, it's to erase the phone.\nListen, Gene, I'm about to become your knight in shining armor.\nYou are?\nYeah.\nBut first, we need to get uploaded to the cloud.\nThat's where we'll find the source code to reprogram you.\nThe cloud?\nIsn't that off the phone?\nDing, ding, ding, ding. You got it.\nYeah, the cloud. Off the phone.\nWe're in Candy Crush, obvs.\nI know a shortcut to Just Dance,\nwhich is right next to Dropbox,\nwhere we can get uploaded to the cloud.\nOf course. Just Dance, then boogie over to Dropbox,\ncatch the link, and zoom.\nHold up. Here's the stinker.\nBefore they let us into the cloud,\nwe have to get past this firewall.\nThe firewall uses face identification.\nYeah, the firewall.\nWhich is really annoying, because I've already tried to get through.\nGuessed wrong once, and now I'm locked out for life.\nLocked out for life?\nYou're thinking, 'cause I can make different faces,\nthe firewall will think I'm different emojis.\nYeah.\nI wanted to say it 'cause it was my idea.\nYou know, women are always coming up with stuff\nthat men are taking credit for.\nYou know what...\nWell, then let's hit the road.\nHi-5, you coming?\nI'm coming!\nWhy do I always think I'm gonna come around on black licorice?\nMy precious.\nHey! Move it!\nCertain death, here we come.\nLet's try this one.\nYouTube?\nWhat a visual treat.\nAnd I don't even need a remote.\nThat guy is so expressive.\nHe reminds me of Gene.\nYeah. Something really wrong with him.\nOur son is a malfunction,\nand you should never have let him go into that cube.\nDon't blame me for this, Mel.\nI am hopping mad at you.\nSee?\nMary, I think we're being followed.\nBut don't overreact.\nI told you not to overreact.\nWhat are you doing now?\nThey'll be in there for hours.\nMary, where are you going?\nI think we should go our separate ways, Mel.\nI thought I knew the Meh that I married,\nbut maybe I don't.\nBut, Mary...\nThis tunnel will help us avoid the Bots.\nThanks for helping us. It's really nice of you.\nNBD, dude. The truth is, you're helping me.\nCome on, let's move it. Why so slow?\nHi-5, stop. Why are you getting so close? What's with you? Back off.\nCan't stop now. I'm having a sugar rush!\nI'll go around you. If I stop moving, my heart's gonna explode!\nComing through, Jailbreak! Look out!\nHey! Watch it, Knuckle Butt!\nI can't feel my face.\nSo, Jailbreak, back there you said I'm helping you.\nI've been trying to get past that firewall for months.\nCome on, come on!\nThe faster we get there, the faster I become a favorite!\nLook at me!\nI just want to bounce out of here,\nget off the phone, and live on the cloud.\nWhat just happened?\nYou don't like it here?\nThere's so many rules here. What is up with that?\nThe cloud is supposed to be amazing.\nThere's so much to see and do.\nSugar crash.\nI can't hold on anymore.\nCatch me, Gene. Catch me!\nAnd you can be whoever you want.\nThanks.\nYou're free! Come on!\nMy gosh, my hands are sweating.\nYou are a hand!\nYeah!\nYou know, come to think of it, I don't really remember\nthere ever being a hacker emoji.\nUm, you know, you're taking up too much of my brain space.\nLet's keep the chitchat to a minimum.\nSomeone likes you.\nWhat are you talking about?\nThis is just like when Peace Sign gave me just one finger.\nI knew she was in love with me.\nLet's go!\nI'm never eating another piece of candy ever again.\nHi-5, don't do it.\nDon't you do it. It's already been in there once.\nDon't do it.\nAre my fingers getting fat?\nI'll tell you what, this bandage wasn't so tight before.\nOkay. We get through this app, and Dropbox is right on the other side.\nWe just need to keep it super DL in here.\nAnd no matter what, we can't turn it on.\nOMG, this turned it on!\nWhat? I'm a hand. It's a big, red button.\nWhat's happening?\nNo, no, no, no, no!\nWelcome to Just Dance!\nFollow my moves and you get to move forward.\nDo the wrong moves and you get an \"X.\"\nThree strikes and you're out.\nOut? What does she mean by \"Out\"?\nDigital death.\nThanks to you, Fingers. Now we're gonna have to dance our way out.\nWhich is all right with me, 'cause I can shake it like Michael.\nOr Michael's glove, anyway.\nAre you ready to dance?\nThis is bad, Gene. I can't dance. I got no groove.\nCome on. Everybody can dance.\nNot me, okay? I'm really stiff.\nSee? I can't... Don't understand.\nOkay. No, no...\nStop, stop. She has to stop.\nI see now what you are saying. Just follow her moves.\nReady to dance in three...\nThis I can't do.\nTwo...\nDude...\nJust shut up and...\nDance!\nIt's too easy! Hee-hee! Shamone!\nJailbreak!\nI got you.\nLook. Just feel the music.\nExpress yourself.\nThrough dance?\nYeah, you got it! Go, girl!\nNow throw some sauce on that dance burrito.\nI'm doing it!\nI'm fully nailing this dance!\nYou got it!\nGreat job! You're moving on to free dance!\nImpress us with your moves to move forward.\nMore dancing?\nYou're killing it, Gene! Slay!\nNice! Shake it, Gene. You won't break it.\nWait a minute!\nI've never seen that dance before.\nWhat's it called?\nUm... The Emoji Pop?\nI love it!\nWhat? You do?\nEverybody, do the Emoji Pop!\nHoo!\nYes!\nPrincess.\nYou're the Princess emoji?\nYou never got off the phone.\nWelcome, new players!\nWhat?\nWho?\nNo!\nWe got to go.\nDon't worry.\nThey're robots. They can't dance.\nDownloading funk protocol.\n\"Can't dance,\" he says.\nMove!\nCongratulations. You're a disco diva.\nHey, Alex, you gonna dance for us?\nAlex, that's extra homework for you.\nHey, Alex, you gonna shake it?\nNo! No, no, no, no, no, no!\nAlex must be deleting the app.\nWatch out!\nWe got to get out of here.\nCome on!\nThis song is my jam.\nHi-5, come on! Let's go!\nHurry!\nHi-5!\nGene!\nI got you!\nGene...\nHi-5!\nGene.\nHey, wait. Where's Hi-5?\nAlex trashed the app.\nAnd Hi-5 right along with it.\nWait, what? Wait, trashed?\nHi-5 is in the trash?\nHe wanted to dance.\nBut I knew it was a bad idea.\nWe got to get him out of there.\nGene, Dropbox is right here. That's our ticket to the cloud.\nAnd the trash is on the other side of the phone.\nWe don't know how many other Bots are out there.\nI'm sorry.\nNo way. We can't go without Hi-5.\nI don't care how far away it is.\nThat's my friend down there.\nI'm not just gonna leave him to get deleted.\nWhat? What is it?\nI've always just thought you got to look out for number one.\nWell, what good is it to be number one\nif there aren't any other numbers?\nOkay.\nI'm sorry. This is my malfunction.\nI just... I can't be meh about anything.\nThis is why I'm going to get reprogrammed.\nWell, it's actually kind of cool.\nWait, really?\nYou know, I think I know a shortcut.\nWe can take the music streams in Spotify.\nLet's go give that big hand a hand.\nCome on.\nAlex trashed the Just Dance app, and our Bots are offline,\nand it's giving me a real headache.\nI am so angry.\nI really need to stay happy.\nCan we please lighten the mood?\nNo one can resist una fiesta!\nNot that happy.\nWe've only got four hours before Alex's phone appointment.\nIf they find a malfunction on the phone, we are all gonna be wiped.\nYeah.\nShe said, \"Wiped.\"\nAim higher, Steven.\nI didn't want to have to do this,\nbut it is fun to press buttons.\nThe illegal upgrade.\nNow that makes me happy.\nI just want to dance.\nDance, please.\nArr! Quiet, you sassy gypsy.\nWhere am I?\nHi! It's so great to see you again!\nYou're in the trash, Fingers for Brains.\nGet away from me, Troll.\nHi!\nIt's so great to see you again!\nI got to get out of here.\nYou can't.\nAnd at the end of the day,\nthe trash gets emptied, and we're all gonna die!\nNo. No, no!\nThis is the last face you will ever see.\nNo!\nThis is Spotify?\nYep.\nEvery one of those streams is a different song.\nIs it safe?\nYeah!\nAre you sure this is a good idea?\nFastest way to the trash, dude!\nCould we at least pick a calmer stream?\nOkay, buzzkill.\nAlex. A bunch of people are hitting the promenade.\nI think Addie might be there, too.\nThat's perfect!\nI have an appointment down there, anyway.\nI've got to get this phone fixed.\nHey, bubble butt.\nYeah, you do.\nMuch better.\nSo, I got to ask.\nIs it true that when a princess whistles,\nbirds fly down from the skies, and...\nHello, stereotype. That is a complete and total myth.\nI'm sorry.\nDid you realize that on the first emoji set,\na woman can either be a princess or a bride?\nThat's why I need to get to the cloud,\nwhere you can be whoever you want to be.\nGet ready. Whale song coming.\n-Wait, wait. Whale what?\n-A whale song.\nFrom Alex's biology presentation.\nYou're not gonna see that sitting around in a cube.\nIt's funny. You want out of the cube, and I want in.\nGene, if that means you can't be yourself, what's the point?\nYou know, I think you're pretty cool just the way you are.\nWe're gonna need this.\nIn the trash? Me? I used to be somebody.\nHere I am. Look. In an old e-mail Alex never sent.\n\"Addie, blah, blah, blah, blah, bla-la-la-la.\"\nAnd then there's me, Hi-5,\nright there, doing my job.\nFYI, nobody cares about you.\nJust leave me, Troll, and let me die\nin this dump alone.\nLet me look for the world's smallest violin in here,\nso you can play it.\nIt's the Hand Angel of Mercy. She's finally come for me.\nGive me your hand!\nI mean, give me yourself.\nTake my hand, angel.\nI'm ready to take my place amongst the other great hands of the past.\nIt's me, Gene!\nGene?\nI got him!\nTake me with you.\nHi-5!\nLet go of me.\nDon't leave me down here!\nYou were wrong, Troll. People do care about me.\nAnd I'm not upset, Troll.\nDo you see how not upset I am?\nGene, you came back for me.\nYou saved me.\nIt wasn't just me. Jailbreak helped, too.\nAnd she's a hugger. Give her a squeeze.\nNo, no, no.\nThere really is nothing greater\nthan the feeling of being truly free.\nYou filthy trolls, I inhaled your stench,\nbut I was once one of you, so I, too, feel your pain.\nNow go. Be free!\nShould be smooth sailing from here.\nGene.\nGene.\nGene?\nAre you Instagramming?\nWhere is my Gene?\nMary.\nYou've really done it this time.\nNo, you haven't.\nMel?\nWhat are you doing in Alex's trip to France album?\nI was looking for you.\nNone of this is your fault, Mary.\nIt's mine.\nWhat do you mean?\nIs that a tear on your cheek?\nIt's my fault Gene is the way he is.\nI have other expressions, too.\nI think they've just been buried away.\nBut with Gene going missing and thinking I might have lost you, too...\nMel. Why didn't you tell me?\nI didn't know myself.\nRight now, I'm so overwhelmed with passionate feelings for you.\nMary, my love for you burns with the intensity\nof a red-hot flame.\nI like that, Mel.\nLet's go find our son.\nTogether.\nWe'll always have Paris, Mary.\nSo, you're a princess.\nI saw your little tiara. Very fancy.\nIs it true when a princess whistles,\nbirds fly down from...\nThat's what I said!\nNo, guys! That's a stupid myth!\nWhat software version are we living in?\nGo read an e-book.\nEducate yourselves.\nJust look behind you.\nWhat the...\nWhat is that?\nSmiler must have upgraded her Bots.\nLet's get out of here before it...\nHi, Gene. Remember me? Smiler.\nI'm coming to you live from the amphitheater.\nWhy don't you come back to Textopolis\nand we can talk through our differences, okay?\nMy friend here will escort you, all right?\nI'm gonna see you soon, buddy. Bye, now.\nWe're actually gonna delete him in front of everyone.\nPsst! It's still on!\nIt's still what?\nJiminy Sassafras!\nMove!\nSeparate!\nTangle him up!\nJailbreak!\nGene! This way!\nIt's still after me!\nLet's go.\nWe have to make it to Dropbox.\nYes!\nNo!\nGo low!\nDon't worry. It can't get in.\nIt's illegal malware, and this app is secure.\nCome on.\nWelcome to Dropbox.\nYou are about to leave the phone.\nRemain seated, please.\nYou might want to hang on.\nWhy do they call this Dropbox, anyway?\nThis is why! I see that now!\nYeah!\nI think we're about to see that candy corn again!\nWe made it.\nHoo!\nGuys, guys, chill. We still have to get past that.\nHoly...\nYeah.\nHello.\nWelcome to the firewall.\nHow may I help you?\nAll right, here goes.\nWhat do I do?\nSit in the corner and don't say a word.\nKeep those sausage fingers to yourself.\nYes, Your Majesty Princess of Nightmares!\nNow, Gene, step onto the password icon,\nand I'll feed you the passwords.\nOkay.\nOkay. 10-11-2002.\n10-11-2002.\nAccess denied.\nOkay, try a different expression.\nIs it gonna blast me every time I mess up?\nYeah, kinda.\nWhat do you mean, \"Kinda\"?\nReady?\nWelcome to the firewall.\nHis favorite food. Chimichangas.\nChimichangas?\nAccess denied.\nThis might take a while.\nBoy.\nKrav Maga.\nKrav Maga.\nMajor Lazer.\nMajor Lazer.\nAbuela Dora!\nSkate or die.\nAccess denied.\nDenied.\nI don't get it.\nWe've tried all the important things in Alex's life.\nHis favorite pet, sport, his favorite grandma.\nI'm sorry, Gene.\nI let us all down.\nYou know, if I had to come up with a password,\nI'd probably use the name of a girl I liked.\nI've been all over the phone.\nHe's never mentioned a girl.\nYes, he has.\nHi. When I was in the trash, I read a very interesting e-mail,\nbut I'm just the dunce in the corner, forbidden to speak.\nWhat e-mail?\nSorry, what?\nWhat e-mail?\nTo a girl at school.\nHe was declaring his feelings of love for her.\nI guess instead of sending it, he tossed it in the trash.\nHi-5, this is very important.\nWhat is her name?\nHer name, yes. Excellent question.\nIt was Tina.\nKaren.\nMarge. Lindsey.\nAlison.\nSarah or Lupita.\nI want to say Lupita,\nbut that doesn't feel right now I'm saying it out loud.\nJennifer.\nGot to find that e-mail.\nPhillipa.\nI think I can access the trash.\nAnnabelle.\n-I got it! Addie!\n-Yes!\nYes! That's it! Addie!\nI knew I'd get there.\n\"Dear Addie, you and I, we're like diamonds in the sky.\n\"You're a shooting star I see,\n\"a vision of ecstasy.\n\"Shine bright like a diamond.\"\nAnd he used a high five, see?\nI guess now we know why he trashed it.\nShade.\nGuys, should we try this?\nAddie.\nAccess granted.\nSnap.\nThis place is amazing.\nThe cloud.\nI can't believe it.\nOne little emoji could sure get lost in a place like this.\nI guess we should make you a Meh\nbefore that Bot comes back?\nSo, we're gonna... We're gonna do that now?\nWe had a deal.\nRight?\nYeah, okay. Right.\nI, guess I'll start hacking.\nWe did it, Gene.\nAll our dreams are coming true.\nI'll be an Alex favorite again, and you'll be a real Meh.\nYeah!\nYeah, but this all seems kind of super-fast now, though.\nDoesn't it?\nHi-5, I just didn't expect to be having these feelings right now.\nWell, maybe you should go and express them while you still can.\nSo, I've been... I mean, um...\nEver since we...\nJailbreak, you're the coolest, most interesting emoji I've ever met.\nAnd after all the adventures that we had,\nI'm just not sure I want all that to go away,\nbecause my feelings right now are, like, huge.\nI just think that they could be enough for me to want to stay the way I am.\nIf it means I could stay here with you.\nLike, forever.\nForever and ever and ever.\nMaybe longer than that even.\nLike in the fairy tales.\nLike, what is \"? Is that a good \"?\nGene, if this is about you deciding not to be meh,\nthen I am all about that.\nI like you just the way you are.\nBut I had a plan.\nRight.\nI'm not just some princess, Gene, waiting for my prince.\nI mean, what you said was beautiful, but...\nGene.\nYou're all meh.\nThe source code worked!\nTurns out I didn't need it.\nFor the first time in my life, meh is all I feel.\nNo! Gene!\nHi. I have an appointment. I'm a little early.\nNo problem. I can take you right now.\nJailbreak!\nDon't do that!\nThat freaky huge Bot has got Gene back inside the phone.\nWhat?\nHe left looking more meh than the meh-est meh face I've ever seen.\nWhat did you say to him?\nIt's what I didn't say.\nWe've got to go get him.\nHow are we gonna get in there in time before he gets deleted?\nI can't believe I'm doing this.\nYou tell anyone you saw this, and I'll crack more than those knuckles.\nBirds do love princesses!\nIt's not a myth.\nIt's not a myth at all!\nWhat happened to becoming a favorite?\nGuess I'd rather have one real friend.\nAnd let's go get him.\nI can't wait to see the look on Gene's face!\nLook at that expression.\nIs that for realizing you've put all of Textopolis at risk,\ncausing Alex to question our reliability?\nHey, that's going too far, even for me.\nIf we can delete this malfunction before his appointment,\nthey'll discover there's nothing wrong with the phone.\nAny last words?\nMeh.\nWell, it's too late for that.\nDelete him!\nWait.\nYou delete Gene, you'll have to delete me, too.\nI have the same malfunction Gene does.\nDad?\nGosh, I don't know what to do.\nYes, I do.\nBot!\nNo!\nSorry, Mrs. Meh.\nI did not see that one coming.\nSmiler, I think you might be making\ntoo much stink out of all this.\nReally? How about you're next?\nI was wrong, Gene.\nI should've believed in you all along.\nWhat a touching daddy-son reunion moment.\nIt reminds me of the time I deleted you both.\nWait. That's this time!\nDelete the two malfunctions!\nNo.\nHow's that for an...\nGreat.\nI can't reach!\nNo! What did you do to my beautiful...\nMy tooth.\nHand, button.\nJailbreak?\nGene.\nYou really are a Meh.\nWhat happened to looking out for number one?\nBeing number one doesn't matter\nif there aren't any other numbers.\nAlex's appointment!\nHe's deleting the phone!\nNo, no, no!\nShow me Alex.\nAre you sure you want to delete everything?\nDo it.\nRed alert! Red alert!\nAlex, no!\nGame over.\nFellas, I'm afraid this is last call.\nDude, Addie's here. You should go over.\nEvery time I try, I screw it up.\nI don't know how to tell her how I feel.\nIf we help Alex connect to Addie, maybe he won't delete us.\nI might be able to bypass the wipe and get a text through to him.\nBut we'll only have time to send one.\nMaybe I should go.\nHe has love in his eyes.\nSend me. Alex looks nervous, too.\nHe's more shy than nervous.\nStop!\nIt's Gene.\nHe's all of those things.\nAn emoji should only be one thing.\nReally?\nThe Princess!\nLinda!\nNot now, Mom!\nGene, you got this.\nThat's not me anymore.\nBut I have to try.\nIt's starting!\nNo, it's ending!\nI'm working on it.\nMom? Dad?\nNo.\nI'm in.\nLast time I was in this cube, I screwed everything up.\nGene, why do you think I came back?\nIt's because of you.\nMe?\nIt's all inside of you, Gene.\nJust try to bring it back.\nAnd do you.\nHi-5!\nI don't want to wave good-bye.\nIt's now or never, Gene.\nJailbreak, now!\nCheck out this emoji.\nNo way.\nHey, I got your text.\nThat's one super-cool emoji.\nI know, right?\nA lot of feelings in one. I get it.\nI like that you're one of those guys\nwho can actually express his feelings.\nYeah. That's me.\nSo, do you think you'd want to...\nYes.\nI'd love to go to the dance with you.\nHey, excuse me.\nWe made it!\nI could've lost you, Peter Pinkie.\nOr you, Reggie Ring Finger.\nEven you, Tiberius Thumb.\nChange your mind?\nYeah, maybe it's weird, but...\nI'm gonna hold on to it.\nGene, you did it!\nYou saved us all!\nMel.\nGene! Gene!\nGene! Gene! Gene!\nGene. Gene. Gene.\nGene! Gene! Gene! Gene!\nGene! Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!\nThey love us! And Hi-5!\nAnd Hi-5! And Hi-5! And Hi-5!\nThey love both of us!\nHey, what up, Gene? Slap me some skin.\nAnd a little porridge for the pinkie.\nHey, Hi-5, save me a dance for later.\nAs long as you're not all hands again.\nBack on top of the hand pile.\nYou're not on the list.\n-Wait, what?\n-What's going on?\nFrom now on, everyone is welcome!\nWait, what is all this?\nIt's for you, Gene.\nEverybody, the Emoji Pop!\nThis is jazzy.\nYeah.\nGo, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant!\nWe are out of Alex's pocket, emojis.\nThis is not a butt dial.\nTo your cubes.\n-Are we up and running?\n-Roger that.\nGood, 'cause we got incoming. Looks like it's gonna be Gene.\nHey, Gene, ready to try out your new cube?\nIn three, two...",

The fact that there are product placements isn't the issue, but the fact that they take up the majority of the movie and replace the story ruin it. Not a single joke gets a laugh, not a single actor tries at all, not a single story beat will change your perspective, the plot holes are numerous given the lack of plot, the animation is not spectacular, and no creativity is put into the world that could have been very inventive. The only plus to the film is the glimmers of social commentary about replacing activity with technology. However, a film about emojis was the wrong place for this. Overall, young kids will like it fine, but I think this is the worst animated film of all time (excluding Foodfight).",

I will say I probably have seen this movie the most out of any movies. It's so hard to watch in fact I broke down crying around the 50th time I watched it, It is one of the worst \"films\" ever. Every thing about it is horrible although not the worst film it is one of the most boring to watch. Something like Trolls 2 is funny because of how bad it is. This movie is just boring just plain boring although it is fun to talk about how awful o a film this is. 0/10",

That was the hottest miveu moment of a;ll time.\n\nTo be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Emoji Movie. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Gene's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Shakespearen literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Emoji Movie truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Poop's existential catchphrase \"Haha! We are number two!\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tony Leondis' genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

This corporate asswipe piece of crap doesn't even pass as entertainment, it's just one big advertisement for various apps and games. Animation is an art form, used to express ideas and entertain.

The story is the foundation of a movie itself, the thing that makes or breaks a movie. If you mess up on a story your done for. Fortunately the story is amazing. I mean common emojis that talk, not even Martin Scorsese could think of anything that brilliant. In its core the emoji movie is a deep and dark complex that rattles my mind to this day.
