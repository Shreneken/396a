Coco is among a small group of Pixar films that best represent these tenets. Coco tells the story of a Miguel, an aspiring musician who has to contend with his family's lifetime ban on music due to Miguel's great-great grandmother being left by her musician husband. These terms are unacceptable to Miguel and he tries to defy his family's rule during the D\u00eda de los Muertos festival resulting in an adventure to the spirit world. Here Miguel meets H\u00e9ctor who helps him become a musician and to meet his long-dead hero Ernesto de la Cruz all while Miguel's ancestors try and track him down lest he get stuck in the afterlife. It's another example of Pixar taking the unbelievable and making it painfully relatable. The ending might be Pixar's best- don't fight the tears, if you do you might pull a muscle in your face. Breathtakingly beautiful visuals combined with an engaging story and so much heart cement Coco as one of Pixar's greatest films.",

In the movie, the connection to the traditional style of the holiday dia de los Muertos (day of the dead) follows a generally accurate route. The movie is set somewhere in Mexico but throughout the years the holiday day of the dead has spread to many of the neighboring counties via relocation diffusion and contagious diffusion. part of the contagious diffusion coming from this movie when it was made in 2017. The creation of this movie was not only to make an absolute banger of a film but to also familiarize other parts of the world with the traditional beliefs and customs of mainly Mexico but also other parts of Latin America and Europe. Other parts of the world also celebrate a similar holiday to celebrate the dead such as the Philippines. The day of the dead is a day to celebrate your fallen loved ones all around the world, making a beautiful tradition.",

            "content": "I cried twice watching this\nI have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.\n\nThough the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\n\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll.",

It was creative, a well-written story, had skillful animation, unexpected twists that I couldn't see coming and that the movie really tricks you with, and characters and songs that were memorable. Pretty good humor too! I don't normally watch Disney movies generally but I am glad that I checked this one out since it's up there now in my mind with all of the classics. It was very culturally significant as well, and I would recommend this for families, couples, kids, people of all ages! Subscribe to Disney Plus and check this one out!",

Coco is about a little boy who wants to become a musician, but to achieve his goal he has to go through many obstacles and difficulties related to his family members. Many Mexican artists are on it as Carlos Rivera. He plays the opening song.\nI recommend this movie because it is a mix of types of movies, for instance, you can laugh a lot and at the same time, it is a real tearjerker.

I also loved the \"layout\" of the worlds in the movie. I liked how it was so clear that there was a separate world (afterlife) that people could leave and come back so easily. I think that Coco has an amazing emotional and societal impact because the afterlife world is so similar to the normal world how all the richest of the rich and famous continue to live like kings and the lower class people live boring lives like they already did in the normal world.",

            "content": "Have always loved Pixar, and really like to love most of their films (all three 'Cars' films and 'The Good Dinosaur' are my least favourites, and although the second 'Cars' had a lot of problems for me the third one is the only less than average one).\n\nAs for favourites, they are all three 'Toy Story' films, 'Inside Out' and 'Up', love 'Wall-E' and 'Finding Nemo' as well. After seeing 'Coco' yesterday, hearing nothing but great things about it and seeing the near-universal critical acclaim, from personal opinion (and many others it seems) it is right up there with the Pixar masterpieces. Would go as far to say it is easily their best since 'Inside Out', which is saying a lot since the films between that and this were lesser Pixar efforts (enjoyed 'Finding Dory' though, though it is a long way from being one of Pixar's best).\n\n'Coco' is one of the longest Pixar films, clocking in at nearly two hours, but it sure didn't feel like it. Seeing it in the cinema, the audience was a quite large one, if on a side note not as many as thought. With it being a family film, the weekend and that it was only released three days ago, part of me was thinking it would be sold out. Throughout everybody, children and adults alike, was laughing, in awe and crying. It is also a different Pixar film, with a unique setting and that it is more music/song-oriented, and has replaced 'Inside Out' as their most mature and in depth, with themes that are remarkably daring and relevant.\n\nLets talk about what is so brilliant about 'Coco'. The film is a triumph when it comes to visuals, one of Pixar's best-looking easily. The animation throughout is absolutely spectacular, whether in the real world or the Land of the Dead. The colours are so vibrant and atmospheric and there is so much gorgeous detailing in the backgrounds, nuances in the way the characters look and the skeletal designs and movements have amazing dexterity that is both clever and ghoulish.\n\nJust as triumphant is the music. Michael Giacchino's score is one of his best and most multi-layered, capturing the spirit of Mexico in a way that's celebratory. The songs are similarly infectious, \"Remember Me\" is not just a beautiful song but it has a great, upbeat message and adds a lot to the story.\n\nThe writing has so much spirit, poignancy and entertainment value. The jokes are sophisticated and amusing, neither childish or repetitive to me and Dante is both adorable and funny, and the emotional elements are truly heartfelt, especially in the last act. The story is bright and breezy in pacing, despite the fairly long length one doesn't feel it. The Mexican culture and family values were clearly comprehensively researched and the film feels like a warm, fun and heartfelt tribute and celebration to culture, family, music and even Latino cinema in the Golden Age (the latter proving crucial to the revelation of a major plot twist).\n\nNot since 'Inside Out' has a Pixar film made me laugh and bring tears to my eyes as much as 'Coco' did, not since 'Paddington 2' has a film's ending leave me sobbing. The relationship between Hector and Miguel has a huge amount of heart and complexity, one can understand the point of view of the Rivera family (living and dead) and the macabre elements are very imaginatively realised.\n\nThe twists in particularly the last act keep coming, mostly unexpected and all very clever. Some elements of the reveal with Ernesto were not that surprising (Pixar have done similar and it is fairly clich\u00e9d, my one slight criticism with 'Coco' but found it easy to overlook) but none of it was guessable too early and it was extremely well done and tense regardless.\n\nAll the characters are fully formed and have strengths and flaws. Hector was the most fully rounded and provided the most heart and a lot of us are likely to find ourselves in Miguel and his aspirations. Imelda is also memorable as a character and the chemistry between all the characters is realised beautifully too.\n\nVoice acting is first rate, especially the remarkably multi-faceted contribution from Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as Hector. Anthony Gonzalez also voices with spirit and emotion, Alanna Ubach achieves a balance to Imelda of not wanting to get on the wrong side of her and having a caring side and Benjamin Bratt shows a side that one is surprised is in him.\n\nIn summary, truly amazing and a celebration of a lifetime. One of the most deserving recipients of a perfect score in a while. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Coco does a lot right lets start with the pros: The animation is beautiful and the visuals compliment it very well its no spiderverse or arcane animation but it is some of the best work Disney has put in to a film like this. The voice acting and music score are both great and really pulls on the heart strings. The story, writing and character development just takes you into this world of wonder with the creative style and visual flare. The cons: The villain is definitely the most forgettable and generic part of the film he comes in very late into the game and has weak motivations he feels more like a plot device then an actual fully fleshed out villain. The pacing at times can feel a bit off sometimes it can be slow and can drag on quite a bit its not bad but could be better. That's about it for the cons i loved this movie its got so much life, heart and soul behind it. This wonderful heartfelt story uses music in a unique way that feels fresh and new with stunning visuals and animation style and a story that stands out from the rest this is a great watch with family or even by yourself.\n8.8/10 highly recommend",

The themes are nice and I suppose very young children may struggle a little to follow all the messages - it could be mildly scary for very young kids but then it does have a PG rating, so that's fair. Its a nice, uplifting and cheery film, even though it very much focuses on the dead - indeed its set during 'la dia de las muerteas', aka 'The Day of the Dead' which is celebrated in Mexico. If you enjoy Pixar films, then I would recommend this film, in terms of the overall feel it gives out - its a bit of a warm hug of a film, as I say re-assuring, nice and not expressly too cinnamon sweet in a bad way. However, if you can't stand CGI animation, then obviously this won't be for you. I also enjoyed the variety of characters, with a rather zany stray/street dog called Dante being one and I also wondered if the inspiration behind the more villainous characters, had been taken from a telenovela (aka latin American soaps).\n\nThis isn't entirely a dumbed-down film and I would highly recommend it for family viewing overall, yes. Oh, and if you enjoy the guitar music, you might want to watch (or shall I say, listen) through the credits while it keeps playing. Its quite soothing and enjoyable.",

Happy, fun, touching, sad, and so on.\n\nIt's about a boy who wants to become a musician against his family's wishes and ends up in the Land of the Dead in this engaging.\n\nFrom watching movies and searching for more information. I would appreciate many topics. First, attention to graphic design. In the movie, you can see that each scene is very beautiful, especially the land of the dead. And from research, I see the efforts of Pixar a lot. They went to explore the real place in Mexico for designing which is awesome. They enter the details of various artworks and songs from Mexico. In addition, the character design looks very Mexican. Second, the plot of the movie. The plot is interesting and has a good speed. When I watch, there isn't a single scene that I'm bored with. There were funny scenes, shocking scenes, scenes that made me cry such as the sense that Miguel returned home and sang \"Remember Me\" to Coco which was very touching and impressed me. Third, is the Expression of Mexican culture. In terms of culture, this movie was shown very well. It's not just about the belief in the land of death. but also, the way of life in the movie. For example, the shoemaker career is famous in Mexico and the main character's (Miguel's) family is a shoemaker in a small community too. That shows a lot of attention to information research to put into the character's role.\n\nThe flaw in this movie for me It's almost nonexistent. If I talk about the disadvantages, it would be, Seeing the land of death too little. Because from looking at the artwork, it's very beautiful and the designer has put details on each floor as well. So, I want to see more of it. That's all flaw for me.\n\nUsually, I'm not someone who is into drama movies. But this movie brought tears to my eyes at the depth of the film. Show that it is a movie that can reach the feelings of the audience. I was very impressed with both the emotional storyline and the beautiful graphics in this movie.\n\nAnd it will be one of my favorite movies forever!!",

The whole theme is basically spelled out and almost pushing it too much in your face. Nice turn of events but it was kind of predictable. Great message, animation, character development. Could be better in comedy but otherwise a great movie. Personally, I preferred Encanto a bit more because the theme is not shoved in your face and was executed better (also no true villain which is great bc that's how life is in real life, no one's purely black or white) not to mention the AMAZING songs and many funny moments.",

Lee Unkrich does a good job directing the film and Darla Anderson as a producer still has it.  The good part about the film is Michael Giacchino made an splendid score to accompany the film.

            "content": "I don't know why but just seeing anything that is about a culture of a place instantly turns me off, especially of East Asian countries. I didn't know much about Mexico so I was actually thinking this would just be some stereotypical Mexicans, wearing sombrero and playing guitar (the movie is about that so that made me even more unwilling to watch it). But I saw it anyway and boy am I glad I did. Coco is one of those movies you won't be expecting will blow your mind away.\nThe story is about a boy named Miguel who really likes to play music. But his family is against music because of how his great-great-grandfather Hector left his great grandmother (referred to Mama Coco in this movie) to become a guitar player and then never came back. They think the rockstar they are seeing is actually Hector, whereas in reality he had been murdered by that rockstar.\nMiguel, however, really wanted to play the guitar, and so he went inside Hector's church and played his guitar, which made all the spirits come to life and turned him into a spirit himself. Miguel was able to enter the world of the dead, where he wore makeup to look like a skeleton and met Hector over there. Hector tells Miguel that the dead people disappear from there as soon as they are forgotten, which is why they always visit the living. And this is the reason why he needs Miguel to tell everyone the truth before Mama Coco dies and Hector is also forgotten forever.\nThere are many things I like about this movie. Firstly all the basic things which we like in all the Pixar movies. The animation is very nice, the colour palette is gorgeous, the story is phenomenal. Pixar has made movies on many countries - Australia (Finding Nemo), France (Ratatouille), Britain (Brave) and Venezuela (Up). And now they have shown Mexico, which is a very good representation of their culture, considering that all the Mexicans reviewing this movie have really praised it.\nAnd secondly the things it has done which we don't see in just any Pixar movies. The music is excellent. The music from the ending is actually playing in my head as I am writing this review. This is how memorable it is. The story is very well fleshed out and in no place have they rushed it. In the beginning we think of Hector as just one annoying man until we learn that he is doing all this to meet his daughter, whom he really wanted to see when he was alive but never got the chance to do so. This movie also sets up a race against time, as Miguel is fading away and when he's gone he will no longer be able to help Hector and he in turn will be gone forever.\nMama Coco also makes this so much intense, in spite of being an old woman who barely speaks. Since she has no senses left, it feels really bad that she will no longer be able to talk to her father. And this is why when she recognises Hector it gives a satisfaction that no previous Pixar movie has been able to give. It also pains to see how she lived her whole life thinking her father left her when in reality he was trying his best to not give her the pain she ended up having. And because of that pain he ended up being forgotten by his own family, for something he was trying to prevent in the first place.\nI'm really glad I was able to watch Coco. Unlike most Pixar movies this movie has literally no problem. It is absolutely flawless. I really hope Pixar makes many more such movies in the future (I think Luka will be like this, and I really hope it is).",

I also didn't really believe the whole no music thing, could've been something more realistic like no listening to the villain's songs or something.  Also the songs were just meh that did get played.

Not to say the next two confirmed movies (Seeing Red and Lightyear) are going to be bad, I bet they are going to be pretty good. But I just don't think you can beat the impact Coco has had on the company. One, besides this movie being made in 2017, I think this is the best animation Pixar has ever given us. It felt like sometimes they were showing off, especially with the guitar picking scenes. Next, the characters. Miguel is such a good protagonist, because he feels like a real boy that would actually react to these things. The side characters are great, with the best of them being Hector, which I don't think I have to go into detail to explain why. And I genuinely didn't see the twists coming in this movie the first time I watched it. Speaking of twists, Ernesto De la Cruz has to be a top 5 Pixar villain, without a doubt. He's such a jerk and I love it! The songs in this movie, spot on, the closest thing to a musical Pixar is going to give us. And the emotional moment of the ending is arguably the strongest Pixar has given us, besides the first 10 minutes of Up. If I had to complain about something, it's probably that the living family that Miguel has is not really that interesting. They're clearly important to the plot and themes of the movie, but I feel like they could have been either more interesting or funnier, but hey that's just me. I can't praise this movie enough. I think this was the best Pixar movie of the 2010s, even better then Inside Out to me. But hey, why just read a rotten tomatoes review written by a teen obsessed with animated movies? Go watch this film for yourself to see the best thing Pixar has given us in a long, long time. Yes, it's that amazing.",

Music is assisting, no wonder the family is so assertive, bland, and violent. And, why does Miguel blame himself for the endgame conflict happening? As far as he knows, his family was forcing him to get rid of music more for the sake of getting rid of it than what the grandfather's absence led to in generations. He didn't know whatsoever that their real grandfather was killed by his thought-to-be grandfather, nor did any of the other Riveras. It really just doesn't make sense. Music as a concept isn't associated with a particular personality, why continue the legacy of getting rid of it all for one person? The plot seemingly just relies on familial stupidity if anything.",

Rich in Mexican cultural background, rich in imagination, gorgeous pictures, perfect songs, this story earns tears from the audience. Full of educational meaning, loving family and the meaning of the death. Coco is my best movie. If I were to rate this movie, it would be  five stars for its plot, theme, moving music and the film's fine graphics.",

Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?\n\nDid I mention bring Kleenex? A full box.

The animation is absolutely stunning with it being realistic and detailed. The only flaw about this movie is the dialogue. There was a few moments where it was funny, but I think there was a lot of missed opportunities to crack jokes and have some really funny moments. Overall, Coco is a stunning film that really deserves more recognition.",

            "content": "The magical Pixar film, COCO, highlights the importance of latin art and culture through a vibrant and friendly animation. While most Disney movies are just for show, this film goes the extra mile to educate the audience in a sad, yet fun way. It captures the cultural message as it talks about latin tradition while including the festivities that are done for Dia de los Muertos. Coco focuses on the beauty behind this holiday while making it entertaining for all viewers to gather intel on the significance of Dia de los Muertos.  \n\tCoco's purpose is to educate the world on the art that comes within the latin culture. Although it talks about a dark topic, the purpose was to give everyone an insight on how the latin culture copes and celebrates the afterlife. By doing so, there is the perfect ratio of crazy, fun, thrilling, and heartbreaking emotions in the film that allow the audience to bond with one other by going through the emotions all at once. For instance, there is an extremely emotional scene that makes you feel vulnerable, especially to those who can relate. The great grandmother has trouble remembering her past due to old age but the only person she remembers is her father. Her great grandson met him in the afterlife and although the entire family disapproves and disowned him- the grandson refuses to let his grandma forget him. He barges into her room with the wrinkled and vintage image he has of him in order to allow her to regain those memories so that his great grandpa isn't forgotten. Once he is forgotten, his soul will vanish from the afterlife \u2018kingdom'. The significance behind this is that although there was so much anger and disappointment towards the great grandfather for abondaindong his family to pursue his music career, someone in his family refused to let his soul be forgotten. This remarkable scene allows each individual's mind to wonder if that is how it really is in real life. To those that have actually lost someone in their lifetime, feel this connection and while some may not understand, it allows you to feel that sorrow and respect for those that have gone through this. Your average Disney movie talks about the fantasy and wonders of princesses and enchanted kingdoms but this film digs way deeper to send a message towards the audience. \n\tWhile this is targeted towards those familiar with the latin culture, it allows people from different cultural backgrounds to learn and understand the uniqueness of this holiday. Dia de los muertos is to many Americans appears to be like a \"hispanic halloween\" when there is such a deeper meaning behind it. It is the day you celebrate your ancestors and loved ones in a content and joyful way rather than to mourn over them. Through music and family, Coco seamlessly paints the image of unity through the mexican culture. Because of the guidance and support of the family in the film, the plot became twice as powerful since that can relate to anyone and not just Mexicans. \n\tCoco has been recognized and awarded for its impressive animation throughout as no other Pixar movie has achieved such a high standard. The perfectly crafted details in this film will have you amazed with its wide range of colors and structure of the ghosttown. The amount of flower petals, candle lightings, and incredibly unique face paintings broadcasted in every other scene, allow you to see some of the minor things that ultimately make up this holiday. The best part of it being animated, is that we get to all feel like children watching this assuming it will not be something so serious and touching, however, Pixar uses it to their advantage to get our attention and really send out their message- loud and clear.\n\tMost Disney viewers expect nothing more than the typical fantasy entertainment every film prior to this one has produced. However, Coco stands out incredibly as it goes above and beyond the standards of a Pixar movie. While this movie hits closer to home for those categorized in this culture, it allows multiple people with all sorts of ethnicities and backgrounds to learn about the importance of this day. I highly recommend this film and believe it is one of the best ones made by Disney.",

'Coco' is straight into my top five of Disney animations.\n\nThe whole 105 minutes are a joy to watch, thanks to its rich and highly meaningful story alongside the wonderful animation and sharp humour. Safe to say, I was not expecting this film to smash it out the park - which it totally does. This is why I don't, personally, look up about films before watching them, I love being surprised.\n\nBig credit also goes to the cast, who play some awesome characters. From Miguel (Anthony Gonzalez) to H\u00e9ctor (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) to Ernesto (Benjamin Bratt), among others, they are all very, very good.\n\nIt isn't just the characters that make this memorable, it is also the excellent plot which is told beautifully. It's filled with not just comedy but also a load of heart - there's a few nicely done twists too. The world that they create around the Day of the Dead is fantastic, while the music fits perfectly.\n\nIf you haven't already, you must watch this! It's brilliant!",

In Michoac\u00e1n in Janitzio de d\u00eda de los muertos is a celebration, because for Pur\u00e9pechas dead is not but a way to stop suffering, so she somebody dies they wear white and celebrates.\n\nDia de los muertos is a prehispanic Celebration.
