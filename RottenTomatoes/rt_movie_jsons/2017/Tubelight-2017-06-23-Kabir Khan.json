            "content": "This movie's most glaring issue is that it plays it too safe. Instead of consistently focusing on the theme of belief and love, it would of been much more interesting and entertaining if they focused on character development, Uncle Bane did not have any guilt for basically pushing the army to Lakshman's brother, and the whole town felt like they were focused too much on Lakshman and his personal life, they also push the audience towards thinking that everyone besides the uncle, his assistant, the army major, and the Chinese family, are heartless (for constantly laughing and poking fun of Lakshman) and stupid (for considering the earthquake a miracle) . One thing that I thought was funny was the presence of the Chinese family (excluding the father) during the brother's reunion, and we can all associate their presence with the whole idea of using the child's reaction to enforce the emotional reaction from the audience, THEY were supposed to take Guo's grand father to the hospital in Calcutta due to his injuries. However they left him mid way when they picked up the major on their way to Calcutta. Overall an average movie that tries to play off of Salman's previous hit 'Bajrangi'. Hope India stops pushing the suspension of belief.",

One strong and perfect and the other brother has issues and faces lots of ridicule.   I laughed and cried.  The story shows so many things.   The horrors of war.   Separation.   Not knowing.  Bully's.   Culture conflicts. Survival, never giving up and belief.   Note,  the movie is not in English.  But, they did excellent job on English captions.   Movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes.  So, go prepared to watch excellent movie.   Go, as this is a really good movie that tugged at my heart.",

I believe the negative reviews come from the lack of romance and \"item songs\", either that or people just don't agree with the over all message of the movie. My family and I loved it.",

It may not win reviews but it is a clean movie about brothers.  What was refreshing about this movie was the lack of a romantic story and the racism that lies in India. Racism towards other races living in India is not a common story told in bollywood. For its efforts, the movie is well paced, has a good cast and has moments that will make you laugh out loud.",

I think this will probably one of Salman Khan's best performances of his career. Each character has performed very well especially the little kid. The film has been shot beautifully and the songs move the storyline forward which is rare these days. Both adults and kids will love the film as there is no vulgarity and there is both plot twists and light comedy moments. \n\nA proper family film worth ones money.",
