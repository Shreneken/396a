Mission Impossible: Fallout is an action film that is intense and fast paced while remaining coherent.

Again, really great car / motorcycle chase (and eventually helicopter chase) and action. But there are no stunts or spectacles (in the scale and style I expect from Mission Impossible) until 2 hours into the movie. That's too late. And even then, there is no iconic setpiece (e.g. the Dubai tower, the Kremlin, the water cooling station in #5, etc.). It's a bit chatty (McQuarrie loves his dialogue) and plot heavy and doesn't have the gadgets or elaborate heist sequence we've come to expect at some point in every MI film. So... good action movie, but off brand and a bit of a disappointment for a Mission Impossible movie.",

It's easy to hate the bad guy, and for me it was a surprise to see, who the bad guy was. \nI loved how Tom Cruise managed it, to get Henry Cavill into the team and of course, Simon Pegg was the hero of the hearts - just as always.\nThere's only one thing I was sad about: William Brandt wasn't there. I know, it has something to do with Jeremy Renner and the fact, that he had to play in the Avengers instead.

Simon Pegg (Benji) Ving Rhames (Luther) and Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa) are outstanding support actors to make up Ethan's team with Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) and Henry Cavill (Walker) terrific in their roles as the bad guys. Plus, adding Julia created that little edge to the mission for Ethan. I really admired the attitude of Ethan as he never gives up regardless of what happens, which makes quite an impression. I thought that the plot was really gripping, putting nuclear bombs in always raises the stakes and excitement. I thought the stunts and camera work were amazing too, especially with Cruise doing the stunts himself. I loved the camera shots during the Paris chase, the rooftop sprint through London and the final battle between Ethan and Walker, which I thought was a masterpiece. This film went to some lengths to get it right, McQuarrie amazing director. I would totally recommend this film if you haven't watched it already.",

            "content": "Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third).\n\n'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. 'Rogue Nation' was on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there was a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure was somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' had enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue.\n\nContrary to the critical consensus that 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is the best 'Mission Impossible' film, personally don't quite agree. It is definitely one of the best ones, and perhaps third place behind 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation' (my personal favourite).\n\nIt does have a little too much going on in places and things get too complicated in spots. Ving Rhames is underused and doesn't seem to be enjoying himself in a basically nothing role.\n\nSome of the dialogue is also somewhat forced.\n\nVisually, 'Mission Impossible-Fallout' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool' and 'Rogue Nation', surpassing the latter as perhaps the most audacious of all six films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound.\n\nThe action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances, hard to pick a favourite with such spectacular stunts and action scenes between the lightning storm, the motorcycle chase, the helicopter battle, the car chase, the London sprints and the toilet martial arts fight. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is again some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling.\n\n'Mission Impossible-Fallout' script is generally sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story, the series' heaviest, darkest and most ambitious, is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go, with the backstories providing some depth. There is, like with 'Rogue Nation' an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go).\n\nTom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows an even better and more confident knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris and Henry Cavill intimidate effectively, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. Vanessa Kirby, Alec Baldwin and Michelle Monaghan are also strong. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames is underused and lacking the charisma that he showed in 'Rogue Nation' despite being under-utilised in that too.\n\nOn the whole, very good, just not amazing. One of the better 'Mission Impossible' films though and among the better films of the year, if not among the very best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Mission Impossible is the one of few movies I can think of that gets better and better with each part. It's almost unbelievable that the sixth sequel to any franchise looks this good and fresh. Interestingly, the director changed for each film in the series and this film is the first where the director team remained the same. The last three are very good, and this one is probably the best in terms of quality. An interesting story that requires attention, tense action scenes that are at the highest level. I must also mention Tom Cruise who is a masterful actor as well as an action star who participates in various stunts. Shooting, driving, racing, jumping, parkour, flying, the character did absolutely everything in a very tense film through his 140 minutes, which is not a small amount for an action film. one of the most appreciated things about Cruise is that what he does onscreen is real. He really does those leaps between buildings. (He broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks.) He really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic. He really does fly a helicopter. Who knows what motivates this guy, but the results are incredible. The music, the stunts, the actors, the cities, and the landscapes. Everything was put together amazingly well. And an ending scene that you will never forget. And, some people may find the plot quite complicated, and it is. You really need to pay attention. I recommend watching MI5, and, if you have time, all the others. There is a reference to all of them along with the movie.",

Take this plot a man and his friends must stop a nuclear bomb and it comes down to him fighting for the denotator ! From 1980 until today there is at least 40 movies with this exact same plot absolutely no originality at all. Listen i like the cast but there was one person missing from the cast that every movie like this or a Bond movie has and that's the super hot spy either she is good or evil but in this film the ladies are pretty but none are a Bond girl. If you are going to take a lame plot like this you need the hot girl, you need weapons that we have never seen before, The mask thing is great but was under used in the one scene they used it and tricked the guy that was good. The audience should not know what's going to happen before it does and they did in this movie except for that. You want more of that you want them going i did not see that coming. The car chase and to long and lost the audience they got bored you need a wow factor for a chase to work today. I am not talking about crazy jumps etc.. for comic relief have a pet grooming truck open in the back and he drives in or pull into a strip joint and the strippers open a secret basement. They all would be better than these guys going 120 crashing the car and getting out and fighting a half a dozen guys. You want the audience to believe this could happen no one believes in these chases. Two helicopters go down and both guys in separate helicopters live come on. You new the moment they said the word detonator there was going to be a fight and he would stop it at the last minute. There was no suspense like i said you have seen this plot dozens of times before. Even with the technology we have today they could have made this exact movie in 1980 and it would have looked the same. To recap if you have no life like the guys who said this was the best then this movie is for you. If you want action, suspense, hot women, new gadgets and a brand new plot then this is not the movie for you. Honestly why do all these movies have to be a bomb or a chemical weapon ? Has anyone had a new idea in the last half a century ? You have a blank page you could have anything going on and they always fall back to these tired plots. Listen i love the cast they are great actors but no matter how good you are you can't take a plot that has been done a hundred times and make it seem new. If your being honest you saw everything coming before it even happened yes even the guy betraying him that was their wow factor for this movie. I could have paused it and said what was going to happen from the beginning to the end every 10 to 15 minute and i would have been exactly right every time. I know a lot of you new what the plot was and new half way thru what was going to happen. You new when they said they need the detonators he would have to fight him and with a second left turn it off i dare you to tell me you didn't. You know what i would have done i would have let it blown up and then had Ethan's twin brother come back in the next movie for revenge. You could have had some of the original cast not in the bomb radius but yes you would have to kill off a couple characters you know why ? No one would see it coming... Yes i am not saying do that exactly i am saying make a movie that is original or if you are going to take one of these over used plots totally change it put your spin on it make it so the audience has not got a clue what's going on. Let me rephrase that you want them to follow the story but every time they think this is going to happen something else happens keeping them on the edge of their seat. The only good thing about this movie if you had to go to the bathroom you didn't have any problem catching up to the plot. I meant no offense to the actors or the people who liked it i liked this movie 40 years ago i just wanted something new.",

No realistic plot and chase scenes lets be honest about chase scenes i don't care if its a car, a motor cycle, a boat, a helicopter etc.. They are all to long.... instead of building of the action they end up boring the majority of the audience. Just once i would like to see a realistic crash all of them are so out there no one believes they would survive let alone walk out and 9 times out of ten get in a fist fight ! The whole point is to make the audience believe this is real when a guy crashes two helicopters and both survive never going to happen in real life. A guy crashes a car going 120 miles and hour he is not getting out with a few scratches and fighting a half a dozen people. Anytime i see this type of stuff i know they are trying to make up for bad writing. My bottom line is if your bored this movie is a bleah something to watch. Oh the other thing that has been done to many times it's time to come up with something new. The timer is going off there is under 5 minutes left on the timer and of course there is a fist fight and the actual time for the fight is longer than the time that was on the timer and of course they always get the timer and turn it off. Honestly you could take the plot of this movie punch it into google and dozens of films will come up with the exact same plot and outcome there is no originality. To recap don't expect a Bond movie no original plot, no super hot women, no exciting and crazy hand guns and other weapons nope this movie could have been made in 1980 and they would have to change nothing.",

A lot of the action scenes seemed like repeats of things that have been done many times before and the ending scenes especially seemed a bit forced to create extra drama. Some of the characters that seemed quirky or engaging in the previous movie were a bit more bland in this one. In this story, the team is supposed to get some rogue plutonium. When it is stolen from under their noses, they spend the rest of the movie trying to get it back. The plot is a bit confusing and implausible at times to the point that you don't end up getting very invested in everything that is going on. Towards the end, there is an odd addition of a storyline about a love interest from Ethan's past that seems a bit tacked on. Overall, this edition of Mission Impossible is not as engaging as some of the others have been. It is enough to be entertaining for a couple hours of viewing, but it probably will not be considered a classic.",

            "content": "I recently watched the 2 latest offerings in the Mission Impossible franchise and for me at least, I think Rogue Nation is the superior movie. It's not by much, but Fallout feels a little predictable, even by the low standards of popcorn fare like this.\nFrom the opening HALO jump there are certain scenes which feel heavily edited as they seem to have parts of dialogue missing: characters suddenly become adversarial with zero build up, wooden expressions on actor's faces appear as if they're reacting to something we haven't seen/heard, and so on (I hadn't realised how bad an actor Tom Cruise can be until I watched these movies. He's very charming and charismatic and does action well enough, but he can't sell drama or emotion to save his frequently in peril life). There are also new characters introduced who simply dilute things and add nothing. The story would work better without them and it feels like a clumsy attempt to interject characters simply so they could be used in future movies.\nAs for the storyline, it's convoluted yet somehow predictably simple. Fallout is best viewed with Rogue Nation fresh in your mind as they do try to connect a lot of story threads  and it feels like a continuation of RN's story, not simply a standalone movie (so people who haven't seen RN won't appreciate a good portion of character motivations and where the big threat has come from). The villain of the movie is very under-served and comes off as more bland than threatening, though that may be more to do with how much screen time he's given, which is surprisingly little considering how big of a villain he's supposed to be. By the end we're seemingly left to assume the good guys have won, but you get the impression that the big threat, The Syndicate, would surely carry on as any time they're mentioned we see a screen full of at least 50 rogue agents, yet by this movie's end we've met less of them than you can count on one hand... And as for the twist of who the traitor might be? Well, it's as telegraphed as it could possibly be. There's really only one choice of who it could be right from the start, so as soon as you make your guess, you're almost guaranteed to be right (because nobody believes it's ever actually going to be ultimate good guy, Ethan, do they?).\nThe stunt work is as impressive as ever, but it gets a little tired. The helicopter chase at the end outstayed it's welcome for me and I thought it would have been better-served to be shorter than it was. With so many tense set pieces it's easy to overplay that hand, which this movie does. Perhaps some clever gadgets used in some situations would be an entertaining diversion from the bull in a China shop approach of trying to one-up themselves with every big set piece?\n\nI'm definitely on board for the next movie as these feel like golden era James Bond movies, made today. They wisely don't move too far into the gritty realism that The Bourne Identity injected into these spy action/thrillers, and rely more on bouncy interactions, big action set pieces and banter. Suspension of disbelief is paramount when watching these movies, but rated for what they are they're entertaining distractions. And isn't that their purpose? Don't expect much and they probably won't disappoint you.",

It also tried to \"copy\" the terrible scene in Batman when All the cops got stuck in the sewers and didn't even try to get out. Awful.\nthis movie was a decade late and a dollar too much.

Which is to say, it is every bit as excellent, it is the quintessential action blockbuster of these few years. It is the pinnacle of the franchise; gripping, brisk, accessible and clever. Everything in my previous review stands verbatim. This is an excellently entertaining flick with everything firing in all cylinders against all odds. \nIt is a better film in every way than its predecessor. It carries its own unique voice despite being the same director as the last film. An action blockbuster is inherently flawed and so it must mask its flaws and perform greater, smarter feats to obfuscate and override its flaws and, like The Dark Knight before it, Fallout manages to do so.\nIt's running in clean, renewable creativity. \nImpossible Mission: You want me to say the Halo jump but while I find its addition into the picture to be pleasingly and shockingly sudden, the use of a CGI backdrop (storm) downplays the reality of it for me. Fallout may be the first in the franchise to have such forward momentum, thrust and its own blistering finale to catch up to, that it forgoes the trope of the big central mission. At a push I'd say the finale is exercised like a team mission, with everybody doing their part, a welcome addition of Monaghan's Julia, and IMAX footage of Cavill shooting a LMG at Tom Cruise flying a helicopter for real. It saved the best till last. \nRoll on Mission: Impossible 7 and \u221e\nAn additional shoutout is needed for Lorne Balfe who managed to create an evocative and memorable score using the bongos from the first film, with a brilliant epic update to the theme, and like David Arnold's work in Casino Royale, also creates a new exciting theme, hopefully for all the rest of Mission. \nAnd in regards to the editing of the IMAX ratio shifts into the movie, I only noticed twice towards the end of the movie and couldn't believe how seamless and effective it was when compared to the eyesplitting nausea of something like the latest Transformers.",

Tom Cruise is always good in the Mission: Impossible series even if the movie around him is not, however one of the best parts of the movie is Henry Cavill as Walker; he has great charisma and is awesome in action scenes.  Mission: Impossible Fallout has thrilling action, is hugely entertaining and leaves me wanting the next film in the series to be just as good as this one.",

            "content": "I was absolutely riveted by how gorgeously shot this movie is, and how the action sequences top everything else seen before, even the Burj Khalifa stunt in Ghost Protocol doesn't compare to this one. This movie is already my favorite of the franchise. Tom Cruise, what can I say about the man, he is unbeatable in the stunt department and he gives a really dedicated performance as well, I loved seeing him reunite with Julia and moving on from what happened to her, I can really feel the struggle inside of him and thought that this outing as Ethan Hunt, was perhaps the best of the series. Ving Rhames is funny, and still has that great fatherlike relationship with Ethan that is so heartwarming to experience. Simon Pegg gives a great performance as always, he is really committed to being Benji and clearly wants to stay on the team, I love Pegg so much and think that he is very underrated as an actor, and I definitely prefer him in this then in Star Trek, not that he was bad in it, he is just so incredibly good in this. Rebecca Ferguson was great once again, but I felt that she was a bit better in Rogue Nation, she doesn't get quite as much to do this time around, but it was nice to see her return. Michelle Monaghan had a most welcome return that felt necessary to Ethan's progression as a character, she is probably done with the series so it was nice to see her character arc, that was started excellently in M:i-III, finished in a satisfying way. Alec Baldwin was also great to see return, though his role was significantly reduced and ultimately, terminated, I thought that his sacrifice felt earned and it contributed to the plot pretty well, I couldn't ask for anything more from Baldwin's character, he was about as good as he could have possibly been, I'm just sad to see him leave so soon. Sean Harris returns as the main villain of this movie and he is super good, I liked him in Rogue Nation, but he was so much more present and developed in this film, I definitely didn't mind seeing him return and enjoyed seeing him in a couple great action sequences as well. Henry Cavill is underrated in my opinion and he gives a great performance here; for the first half of the film, he basically fills in the gap that was left with Jeremy Renner's absence, but then in the second half he becomes Sean Harris's right-hand man, I really bought into him as a villain and thought that he was really very physically imposing, he did a great job with what he had to work with. Vanessa Kirby was the disposable character of this movie, I really didn't see the point of her character when her brother basically did everything for her. Angela Bassett was basically Laurence Fishburne from M:i-III, she is in this movie for maybe 10 minutes, but she wasn't bad. The plot of this movie is great, but the in-between parts get very confusing, don't get me wrong, Christopher Mcquarrie wrote an excellent script, but it got confusing when multiple people all betray someone differently, I legitimately got confused for a couple of minutes, but it worked itself out by the end. It is still the best script in the series and I love how emotional it ties in with the characters, it was just complex and thought-provoking like the first film, but in an amazing way that challenges the audience. The helicopter chase sequence is the staple of the entire franchise, I was so invested and excited by literally every second it was happening, the camera angles were all perfect, the music added to the intensity of the situation and the minigun that Henry Cavill uses is so epic, I wanted it to never end. This is one of those super rare gems that tops what you thought could never be topped in terms of action sequences, stunts, and a great sense of teamwork. This probably my favorite team out of all of the movies, they whittled it down to only the very best and I hope to see them in the next two movies as well. The subplots could use a little more polishing and Vanessa Kirby's character could've been scrapped, but other than that, I was blown away by what this movie has achieved. This movie moved fast and slow and it achieved that balance of perfect pace that is so rare to see nowadays and it is accompanied by a super compelling script and mind-blowing action sequences, both helmed masterfully by Christopher Mcquarrie. This also has the best third act in any action movie ever, it is genuinely intense and also immensely entertaining, it leaves an amazing taste in your mouth for a while after it ends. This will be hard to ever top but I have been proven wrong in that department before, even just within this series, I only hope that I will be proven wrong again.",

I never liked the guy (even in his 80s prime), but seeing how far he pushes himself with the stunts in these movies is part of what makes them work so well. In a time when the action genre is filled with nothing but CGI and green screen, seeing Cruise go full Jackie Chan for these films deserves some admiration. The icing on the cake is that we're once again treated to a smart script, great supporting cast, plenty of surprises, and an infectious sense of fun. Although if you haven't seen the previous Mission Impossible, Rogue Nation, you might be a little lost, as this is the first entry in the series that isn't a standalone film. I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be enjoying this franchise more than Bond or Bourne, but here we are.

The intense action was cranked up to 100%, making sure to leave nothing unscathed by the chaos that is left in the trail. While the movie was overall immensely predictable, the plot was still solid and the storyline was still immensely entertaining. The acting was as awesome as usual, both from returning cast members and new ones, adding in great emotion to all of the characters, which would've otherwise been rendered as two-dimensional within a dumb action movie. The characters themselves were well written, allowing for a great variety of different personalities to intermingle and add a greater depth within the film, making it feel sophisticated and emotionally realistic. The tone of the film was great, allowing for the film to be mainly intense with leg-room for some comedic moments. What also made this film really great was that it is the first sequel in the franchise to have more of a direct continuation from a previous storyline, instead of just sticking with the James Bond pattern of independent adventures with recurring characters in each film. Overall, this film was really well done. It was the most action-packed and explosive installment by far while managing to remain emotionally complex and well-acted, even if the plot line was predictable.",

An irritatingly predictable plot with a cast that constantly seemed to be on the brink of boring themselves to death on set.\n\nTo summarize the acting and really the movie altogether - I offer the following formula for your consideration:\n1) *literally any predictable event/revelation that the writers/producers think they invented to completely obliterate the audience's preconceived notions of modern cinema*\n2) *every single character the audience is expected to root for not breaking a single sweat in their 'acting' arsenal during the build up to this 'mind-altering' revelation*\n3) *the most agonizingly obviously outcome to previously mentioned event/revelation*\n4) (every single character the audience is expected to root for) \"Oh, are you, the audience, surprised by *insert event/revelation*? I, on the other hand, remain unfazed by this *insert event/revelation* because I had known all along that this would ultimately be the outcome. In fact - all of those actions you saw leading up to this *insert event/revelation* that were somehow both incredibly predictable yet statistically improbable to foresee were all part of my/our premeditated plan that resulted in this exact outcome.\"\n5) (every single character the audience is expected to root against) *also audibly unvexed and bored* \"I will now try my absolute best to act surprised while simultaneously launching my extremely specific counter-attack that I had obviously devised in advance for this exact scenario.\"",

This is what you come for, not a deep story or in-depth character development. You want to see Tom Cruise run really fast and jump off of tall things. While the action falls just short of the quality from the third film, it still packs a hard punch.\n\nGenre: 9\nIt is surprising to me that, after six films and the following of a somewhat similar formula along the way, this franchise still continues to stand at the pinnacle of espionage action films. Director Christopher McQuarrie not only manages to keep the action fresh in Fallout, but he makes you think they could easily pull off another three. Not the best M:I movie, but it takes you on a wild ride nonetheless.\n\nMemorability: 9\n\nPace: 9\n\nPlot: 9\n\nResolution: 9\nWasn't perfect, but solid enough to wrap the film up nicely. I was hoping for a little more for Ethan, but something tells me that things are going to work out for him just fine in the end. You will definitely leave the movie excited from the seventh installment.\n\nOverall: 91\nMission: Impossible\u2014Fallout is clever enough to make you use your brain, but not too over-the-top where you're left thinking, \"Wait, what?\" I have mad respect for McQuarrie as it's hard as all get out to keep a franchise fresh. After a terrible second try, the franchise has been balling ever since. Long live the running of Tom Cruise!",

Knowing that Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt) does his own stunts adds a level of danger while you're watching it. Whether he's scaling a rope hanging from a helicopter or legitimately flying that same helicopter, he's great and it's tense. Bringing back Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) was brilliant. It really makes this feel like a sequel to the last one and he is a great villain. His voice is menacing and he's smart enough to be a true threat. Adding Henry Cavill (August Walker) was also genius. He brought an imposing physical rival. Combine him with Lane and you've got a formidable antagonist team. The work done by the IMF team is again fun and their interplay continues to be a highlight of the series. I loved Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa Faust) almost as much in this one as the previous installment. There are some thrilling moments and great twists peppered in throughout this, as well as some fights that will leave you breathless. Also, love needs to be shown to the score. They make the best use of the iconic Mission Impossible theme during one particular scene.\n\nWeaknesses: Though I liked Cavill's performance and the idea behind his character, there were issues. He gets some awful lines of dialogue and the movie kind of spoiled his villainous side through the trailer. That took a lot away from the moment. I do feel this is a bit too long and it drags at a few points.\n\nOverall: The best installment of the franchise. Huge action, good acting, a solid score, and edge of your seat thrills.",

The baggage of Hunt's private life from previous movies might be one too many ingredients in the mix, but these are small gripes; Fallout is slick and confident, with stunning location filming and on-the-edge-of-your-seat entertainment delivered with class and style.",

            "content": "Tom Cruise reprises his role of super agent Ethan Hunt accepting a mission with impossible stakes should he choose to accept it. His support team is back with Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson. Christopher McQuarrie teams up with Cruise for another adrenaline pumping entry into the expanding Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nEthan is soon reminded of his past when he is shown a picture of his deceased wife which is poignant if you have been familiar with her presence in past movies. He is an unstoppable force attempting to keep the world safe completing one mission at a time. However, he has his limits and it still haunts him how it turned out with his wife. The theme of trying to let go of the past but not being able to will repeat itself throughout the picture.\n \nHis trust is only placed in his circle of associates and understandably so given how he has been betrayed in the past. The story starts to really take off when Ethan and his associates have to deal with the repercussions of a failed mission. Henry Cavill makes his presence as another agent who disagrees with Ethan's methods scrutinizing most of his moves. This film tries to show Ethan as more flawed starting to struggle with his age and not an unbreakable machine. There is some success and the picture of his wife clearly affects him piercing a seemingly impenetrable emotional armor.\n\nThe movie fails when it shows his wife later in the film as the scene is poorly constructed and we do not get a real satisfying payoff for what the characters went through. This felt rushed so we can get back to the world saving events and the tension of a short amount of time to accomplish the mission. Stakes are incredibly high but it never feels possible Ethan will fail despite the enormous odds. It would be difficult for the movie to go into another direction and Cruise is the driving force behind these films. But they could have played more with Ethan's character and made it feel he was in real danger. The confines of continuing the franchise prevents the film from taking any real risks with advancing a more interesting narrative.\n \nThe motivations of characters are not explored very well with them changing their allegiance or showing their true colors so readily. Cavill and other characters present in the film could have been more intriguing with more development. Development suffers at the hands of spectacle and unfolding, spectacular action set pieces. Action sequences are enthralling and help to keep the frenetic pace. We are also treated to Cruise performing extraordinary stunts and over the top choreography.\n\nThe best action movies have healthy doses of incredible choreography but they also have characters worth caring about under the stress they are placed under. This picture suffers under the weight of continuing a highly successful franchise. Maybe, it is the reminder of the world needing saving again but this has been done too often with smaller stakes being more welcome. The tension build up just needed to have different methods rather than regurgitated methods such as a countdown on bombs.\n \nEthan is still an unstoppable force and this makes it difficult to relate to him. A problem lies with the movie feeling like just another entry in the franchise when it could use a different take where maybe Ethan is not the protagonist. Still, the movie is a lot of fun and the action is something to behold even if the story feels more of the same. I will always watch each entry with an eye for the action but hoping the franchise decides to take a risk or two with subsequent movies.",

            "content": "Spoiler alerts\nMission: Impossible \u00e2\" Fallout is a 2018 action spy film movie written, directed and produced by Christopher McQuarrie. It is the sixth film in the Mission: Impossible series. The movie is a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible \u00e2\" Rogue Nation (2015). The movie stars Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby & Henry Cavill. \nThis time around the CIA is forced to work with the Impossible Mission Force (IMF), still led by Ethan Hunt (Cruise), to recapture arch villain Solomon Lane played by Sean Harris, to stop a disaster of epic proportions. CIA worker August Walker is played by Henry Cavill, who is new to the series.\nI really liked this film because the action is jaw dropping. It's got a great cast and a runtime of 147 minutes which was just right. We see Cruise doing new stunts we have never seen before. In one amazing scene we see Walker and Hunt parachute out of aeroplane into a thunderstorm. Cruise was so dedicated to doing a good job that he injured himself filming an action scene that went wrong. In jumping from one building to another he broke his ankle and the movie had to be put on hold for 3-4 months.  Henry Cavill makes an excellent good guy/bad guy character which is a change from him playing Superman.\nAt times this film was a bit confusing. For instance, the scene where you see Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) wearing Solomon Lane's mask. Annoyingly, the trailer shows a thrilling scene of a helicopter spinning out of control and nearly hitting a truck however, that scene didn't make the final cut of the film!  I think this movie is good action flick, but the director left out interesting scenes.",

Furious at the IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Hunt as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Fast, sleek, and fun, Mission: Impossible\" Fallout lives up to the \"impossible\" part of its name by setting yet another high mark for insane set pieces in a franchise full of them.\" Variety's Peter Debruge called the film the series's most exciting installment to date, saying, \"McQuarrie clearly believes in creating coherent set pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense.\" Entertainment Weekly's Chris Nashawaty gave the film an \"A\" grade, commenting on Cruise that \"He's still Hollywood's hungriest movie star\", with the series getting \"better, twistier and more deliriously fun with each installment\". George Simpson of The Express complimented \"the action is brutal and gut-punching, the pacing heart-pumping and the stakes so high it's gasp-inducing at times,\" adding, \"Fallout is an improvement on all the previous films' failings, drawing together all the best aspects of them; simultaneously giving off that classic vibe of the original while never being afraid to continually evolve;\" he gave the film five out of five stars. The Telegraph's Tim Robey summed up the film as \"spectacular and eye-popping,\" deeming it \"the blockbuster of the summer\" with \"a pleasingly sinuous plot,\" and calling the film and its series a \"Bond-like franchise\"; he also rated the film five out of five stars. \n\nWith the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise Tom Cruise has created a Bond like legacy that keeps on going and you keep on wishing for more. Since the first one all the way back to 1996, these six films have been of different standards, but yet really entertaining from several point of views. Personally I really liked \"Mission: Impossible\", \"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\" and \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\". With \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" Cruise takes us further on to fantastic near-exhausting action/stunt sequences that is just out of this world, but I think that this is not the best film storywise in the series. Director Christopher McQuarrie who wrote the script as well did not manage to keep it fully together in my opinion, but his direction does. Tom Cruise is in true action mode for sure, so much that he broke his ankle during the shoot and I do think that Henry Cavills Special Activities Division operative August Walker is a good bad guy with a moustache and the driving force of a terminator. I loved MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (our Swedish pride Rebecca Ferguson) in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, so I was happy to re-see her in this film. She just rocks! \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is not bad, but not as good as I hoped when I saw the first trailers. \n\nTrivia: In August 2017, Tom Cruise suffered an injury while filming a stunt jumping from one building to another. He was able to grab onto the other buildingthanks to a harness strapped onto him and his history of performing his own stunts for action films, but his ankle fractured upon the impact of the jump. Cruise then got up and attempted to run it off, which was what the scene called for, before he and the crew decided to stop filming. Shooting was delayed for eight weeks following the injury, but the footage of the stunt used in the film and its trailers just so happened to be the actual injury.\n\nIt was announced by Cruise on January 14, 2019 that the seventh and eighth Mission: Impossible films will be shot back-to-back with McQuarrie writing and directing both films for July 23, 2021 and August 5, 2022 release. In February 2019, Ferguson confirmed her return for the seventh installment.",

Mission Impossible, Fallout. I thought that the story line was very good. It kept me interested throughout the whole film , even though I have never seen any of the previous films the story line in the film was easy to get a hold of and allowed me to get to grips with what is happening . The use of sound effects made the film seem very intense and realistic to what you was watching. The use of different camera angles and clever editing made the film much very gripping on its own. There is not a boring moment throughout the whole film. \n\nThe mise en scene in the film has a wide range of differences. For example, some parts of the movie are set in major capitals of the world such as London and Paris but towards the end of the film, in the helicopter fight scene , it is set within the outskirts of China, within the snowy mountains. The costume worn within the film make it easy to know who is who , for example Ethan Hunt ,played by Tom Cruise, is shown wearing a suit at the start of the film so we know he is an important character to the story. Also the suit hints that he may be James Bond style character, which we soon find out he is.",

More than twenty years since the first of these six films had come out and it is still a surprise when a Mission Impossible film ends up this good. It really feels like we are living in a solid era for action franchises with the Raid, John Wick, MI and even the Fast and Furious for our b-movie action goodness. We live in exploding times!\n\nHonestly, I don't think I have seen an action movie/spy game thriller that was this much fun in a while. Everything they did in this film was top notch. From the stunts to the chase sequence, to the amazing Helicopter chase...I mean damn. Also, if Cavill not being Superman anymore means we can see him as the beast he was in this movie, with an equally as beast mode a mustache, then I am all good with that. There are a few nitpicks, I thought that the movie dragged a bit between the middle and the end, I also had a few moments when I wasn't exactly convinced with Cruises acting, but nothing that really took me out of the film. Also while there was a spy story as always with this franchise, it still relies on the stunts and action to do the heavy lifting. Which isn't bad, when the action you have is this good. \n\nMI: Fallout is very good. One of the better action films of the last while. Easily deserving of the praise it has gotten and making me wish I had seen it a lot sooner.",

In writer-director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s adrenalized espionage thriller, Hunt is tasked with recovering a trio of plutonium cores while juggling his relationships with colleagues (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin), alluring spy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and former wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan)\u2014not to mention CIA-assigned assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill), who has orders to kill Hunt should he stray from his assignment.

La introducci\u00c3\u00b3n de Elsa como personaje femenino me hab\u00c3\u00ada parecido fant\u00c3\u00a1stica y la relaci\u00c3\u00b3n de AMISTAD que ten\u00c3\u00ada con Ethan me parec\u00c3\u00ada refrescante. Por favor podemos encontrar de m\u00c3\u00a1s pel\u00c3\u00adculas en las que no tenga que haber un innecsario romance entre personajes.

Chapo.\n\nPero aqu\u00c3\u00ad de tirar toooodo eso a la basura: Elsa es un perrito faldero de Ethan enamoradita hasta las trancas y teniendo apenas NADA de importancia en la trama; metamos tambi\u00c3 (C)n a la mujer de Hunt para que esta la diga que est\u00c3\u00a1 bien que se lie con Elsa, porque ella ya tiene una buena vida. \n\nLuego esta el personaje de Henry Cavill, que ten\u00c3\u00ada tant\u00c3\u00adsimo potencial como se ve\u00c3\u00ada en los trailers: una maquina eficiente de la CIA,implacable e imparable. Algo disinto a lo que fue Solomon Lane en la anterior cinta, pero igual de terror\u00c3\u00adfico.  No, es simplemente un torpe bobalic\u00c3\u00b3n, que no est\u00c3\u00a1 ni a la altura de Hunt, que no supone apenas una amenaza, y cuyo giro de gui\u00c3\u00b3n es estupidamente previsible. \u00c2\u00bfD\u00c3\u00b3nde est\u00c3\u00a1n esos momentos t\u00c3\u00adpicos de MI donde te revelaban cosas interesantes que no te esperabas?\n\nNo s\u00c3 (C), no le pongo peor nota porque sigue teniendo algunas escenas de acci\u00c3\u00b3n muy curradas, es entretenidilla a pesar de que la trama es aburrida, no est\u00c3\u00a1 bien llevada, no hay tensi\u00c3\u00b3n (a persar de que ten\u00c3\u00adan muchos personajes que pod\u00c3\u00adan haberla hecho), y esto me trae muchos recuerdos de Spectre (una de las peores pel\u00c3\u00adculas de 007 jam\u00c3\u00a1s hechas).

Cruise once again brings us insane stunt work and some of these will have you looking away. You have to give it to him, he can really entertain. This sequel is a great follow-up to Rogue Nation, a direct sequel and it delivers on the action, but not a good ending. I was hoping they might return to a more espionage style film for the sequels, but that won't be the case with McQuarrie.

Tom Cruise doing his own stunts adds a lot to the intensity of the movie. It's not a bad movie. It's not quite as good as people are making it out to be though. This is a slightly toned-down version of previous MI movies that were just way too over-the-top. This movie has more heart, and they actually pause the action every once in a while to have real, meaningful dialogue. I still feel like the characters involved were underdeveloped, but they're at least going in the right direction. It still feels like there's a little too much going on. Ilsa seems like she's just thrown in there to be the \"powerful\" female character who can do no wrong and who never loses. Oh wait, she does a couple times, but she's just fine after that (from being hit by a car to just killing everyone). It's kind of ridiculous and borderline... wait for it... MARY SUE-ish... There's a strange moment in the movie where Ilsa suddenly joins up with them, and it's never really explained because the scene before she's hiding in the shadows and randomly shooting guys, and then in the next scene she hops into a truck with them without anyone saying anything. Kinda strange. They toned down the feminist bull crap, but it's still there. For that reason it doesn't feel quite as real or intense. But it's a movie. *sigh* We're so starved for good films that it seems we'll freak out over anything even remotely good these days. It's an improvement, but this is no classic. It's just good. Not great. Don't get your hopes too high.",

            "content": "Mission Impossible: Fallout\n(2018)\n\nPlot:\nSame missions are not a choice. On a dangerous assignment to recover stolen plutonium, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) chooses to save his team over completing the mission, allowing nuclear weapons to fall into the hands of a deadly network of highly-skilled operatives intent on destroying civilisation. Now, with the world at risk, Ethan and his IMF team (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson) are forced to become reluctant partners with a hard-hitting CIA agent (Henry Cavill) as they race against time to stop the nuclear fallout.\n\nReview:\nAlthough the action scenes are top class, and the stunts are amazing, this movie just seemed like another Tom Cruise action film to me. The storyline was half decent, even though the director overcomplicated it with technical jargon, and it was good to see the original cast back. After watching the bonus material, I don't think you can appreciate the work that goes into making one of these movies, especially with Cruise doing most of the stunts, and the director could have easily used a green screen for a lot of the locations, which he decided against. My problem with the film is the fact that it's not that different from the rest of the Mision Possible movies. It's just Cruise pushing the bar when it comes to the various stunts, including learning to fly a helicopter for this film. Don't get me wrong, it's still worth a watch if you're into your epic action films but I'm personally getting a bit fed up with Cruise running, jumping, and driving every vehicle made. After his amazing performance in Tropic Thunder, which a lot of people rated him for, I think it's about time Cruise stopped saving the day, against all odds. Anyway, two years after Solomon Lane's (Sean Harris) capture, the remnants of his organisation, The Syndicate, have reorganised as a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to buy three stolen plutonium cores in Berlin before the Apostles can. He is joined by Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) for the mission, but the team fails when Luther is taken hostage and Ethan's attempt to save him allows the Apostles to make off with the plutonium. Furious at IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) instructs Special Activities Division operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Ethan, as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium. I think you can guess where the movie goes from here! Basically, Ethan and his team go through hell to try and retrieve the plutonium, which they lost at the beginning of the film. With the help of MI6 agent IIsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who saves Ethan's life a few times during the movie, their information finally leads them to a medical camp in Kashmir, were Ethan's estranged wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) is working. The team deduces that Solomon and August are actually working together and that they plan to detonate the nuclear weapons over the Siachen Glacier, contaminating the water supply of Pakistan, India and China, with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into anarchy from which Solomon and August hope a new world order will emerge. Now you know why I said that the director overcomplicated the plot! Basically, some nutter wants to blow up half the world, so Ethan and his team have to stop him. Personally, I thought that there were way too many characters in the film, and the action went on forever. You can see where every penny of the budget went, especially as they shot in real locations but I would have liked more character building, and some wit to lighten the mood. It is non-stop from the beginning to the end which, in some ways, becomes a bit claustrophobic after a while. We all know that Ethan is going to save the day, once again, and after many years of saving the world, the stupid CIA Director still thought that he went rogue, which I thought was ridiculous. Anyway, I think that Tom Cruise has done every stunt known to man by now, so I think it's time for him to hang up his \"adrenaline junkie\" shoes, and try something new to entertain audiences. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who also brought you The Way of the Gun, which I really enjoyed, Jack Reacher and Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. He also produced Valkyrie and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, and he wrote the Usual Suspects, The Way of the Gun, Valkyrie, The Tourist, Jack Reacher, Jack The Giant Slayer, Edge Of Tomorrow, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation and The Mummy which also starred Tom Cruise. McQuarrie and Cruise have built a healthy relationship over the years, which is why they produce some of the most extravagant stunts seen in film. It might also explain why most of Tom Cruise's films are similar to each other, and we always have the famous running scene, which gets on my nerves. With another Top Gun in the pipeline, which is also being directed by McQuarrie, Tom Cruise is definitely a true Hollywood star, and he is still got the audiences flocking to the cinema, judging by the profit that this movie made. After the terrible, The Mummy, I did think that people had enough of Cruise's action blockbusters but this movie has proved that one bad movie won't tarnish his name. As this is the 7th highest-grossing film of 2018, which is Cruise's highest-grossing film to date, and the highest-grossing film in the franchise, I'm sure the MI franchise isn't over, even though Cruise is 56 years old. \n\nBudget: $178million\nWorldwide Gross: $791million\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Thriller\nCast: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan, Wes Bentley, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby and Frederick Schmidt. 5/10\n\nPlease check out my Movie Review blog at leonblackwood.wordpress.com",

Maybe he took a slight hit getting beaten up in the rest room, but then he comes out swinging in a cavalcade of action sequences strung in to a movie.\nYou might vaguely recall the Point Break remake from a couple of years back.  That movie rivaled this one for stunts and scenery, but while PB was all stunts and nothing else, MI has settled in to a relationship film of sorts - with the girlfriend, ex-wife, and his team (Pegg and Rhames).  And of course this amps up the stakes for Cruise as he has to run from friend to friend to save them.  Much of this is predictable of course, and the world is at stake AGAIN; but Fallout again does a great job of retreading what is a very familiar story.  There are even scenes that point out how Cruise is a hamster on a wheel and trapped.\nSupporting cast is so-so.  Lane is nice and creepy.  Superman plays the ass pretty well.  Alec Baldwin is killed - so that is always a plus in a movie.\nI am starting to feel bad for Cruise's character - every movie he saves the world, and then he gets second and third guessed by suits in Washington - there goes the guy that saved the world the wrong way!",

No political bullshit, betrayal of the team and such like nonsense.\n\nHowever, in pretty much every movie Ethan or the entire IMF team was betrayed or set up and he had to, not only complete his mission but, clear IMF from whatever shenanigans the story writers had dreamed up. The movies have been Mission Impossible in name only. I wonder if the moron script writers has ever watched the show.\n\nIn this movie too there is indeed a bunch of political nonsense and betrayal. Shit that I could be without. But at least IMF and Ethan's team are on his side throughout the movie. There are also a few clever parts where they trick the bad guys in a good old fashioned Mission Impossible style.\n\nOtherwise the movie is mostly a classical Hollywood action adventure/thriller movie. Plenty of, more or less, non stop action. There are a few of the usual WTF story holes and defiance of physics when it comes to the stunts of course. The dumbass CIA director was a completely unnecessary element though.\n\nStill, overall I found this installment in the franchise to be one of the better ones. Maybe even the best one yet.",

There is literally nothing I can pick apart in this film, as act by act, the pacing, story line and action pieces flow so perfectly , that they are nothing short of perfection. Meticulously crafted, choreographed and shot, they are a visual adrenaline rush AND NEED TO BE SEEN IN IMAX.\n\nFor his 6th go around as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt, Cruise SOMEHOW ups the ante and seems hell bent on creating a cinematic experience that won't be forgotten. I had the privilege of watching this with a GREAT crowd in a packed theatre and after several action pieces, people were clapping and cheering. That's how good he is.\nHis \u00ef\u00bf 1/2I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ll thrill you or die trying\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? attitude makes this one of the most perfectly conceived blockbusters in recent memory.\n\nCast members from M:I old come in throughout for support and give this a great deja vu feeling, but the real stand out is easily Henry Cavill. Cold blooded, heavy handed and without remorse , he is F**King awesome in this movie as a CIA Agent sent to chaperone Hunt. I won't spoil anything but a particular bathroom scene highlights why Cavill is a pure badass and how he can be a big action star outside of his Superman role.\n\nI could go on and on about a million things I enjoyed , as Director Christopher McQuarrie's directing, Cinematographer Rob Hardy' s INCREDIBLE WAY OF CAPTURING action and Lorne Balfe's methodical and tense score make this for the BEST movie of the summer.\nGO SEE THIS\n\nGrade : A +",

            "content": "The older Tom Cruise gets, the less time there is between his Mission: Impossible sequels. There was a mere four years between the first and second installments and it seemed that might be the end of things, but six years later when Tom Cruise needed a public face lift it was Ethan Hunt who was called on to come to the rescue. Five years passed and the series reinvigorated itself with Brad Bird's franchise-best, Ghost Protocol, and then four years passed before writer/director Christopher McQuarrie took over and teamed with Cruise to produce the worthy follow-up that was Rogue Nation. Now, only three years have passed between the last and what is now the sixth installment in this ever-expanding action franchise. I can only imagine that we'll have another Mission: Impossible movie by 2020 at which point Mr. Cruise will be fifty-eight years-old. It is not only Cruise's age that splinters the race against time these movies will become though, but also the fact the one-time biggest movie star on the planet is hard-pressed to find success elsewhere outside the franchise. This creates questions of what might Cruise do once he's no longer able to jump out of airplanes, scale mountains, or fly helicopters, but these are questions more curious than they are concerning. For now, audiences should simply revel in the fact Cruise can still accomplish what he has in order to bring FALLOUT to the biggest screen ever-which is where you should see it. Mission: Impossible - FALLOUT is the pinnacle of what it seems this entire series, knowing or unknowingly, has been leading to. It is McQuarrie's The Dark Knight, it is Cruise's commitment to celluloid that will define the middle act of his career, and it is by far one of the best action movies ever made. Yes, FALLOUT is everything a fan of the previous films could want in that it revolves around a convoluted plot of double crossings and inconspicuous baddies throwing obstacles at our beloved team of core heroes, but what elevates this latest entry above many of the others is the way in which it caps off this trilogy of sorts that began with Ghost Protocol where these movies weren't just using Cruise's Hunt as a conduit for action or trying to humanize him, but more discover the person Hunt actually is while detailing his journey to figure out who he truly wants to be. FALLOUT is as much a coming to terms and peace with who the character is for Ethan Hunt as it is a clarification on the haze that still tinged who Hunt was over the last few films. How this will affect future installments will remain to be seen, but as the core of FALLOUT it only adds substantial weight to a movie that excels in every other facet of the genre it is excited to exist within.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

(The film interestingly stars Trump adversary Alec Baldwin).\nThe film has great stunt work some of which are noticeably performed by star Tom Cruise himself. One particularly painful stunt landed Cruise with an injury that halted filming for a while. The stunt makes the final cut. The pain is there to see!\nHowever the action sequences have been seen before in other films, most noticeably the James Bond franchise.\nI lost count of the number of times I said to my wife who was also watching. I've seen this before in such and such or wait for the scuba divers to rescue the guy locked in a security vehicle which has been rammed into a river!\nI am trying not to make my liking of the Bond films effect my review but it is difficult at times!\nThe story is a little complicated but the action keeps your attention span and director Christopher McQuarrie paces the film well. The film has a two and a half hour run time which passes very quickly.\nSpy film aficionados will also take note of the casting of Henry Cavill as CIA agent August Walker. Cavill was cast in spy film The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in 2015.\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie directed the last Mission: Impossible entry 'Rogue Nation' back in 2015 so comes with experience.\nTalking of experience the crew are veterans or the next generation of Bond film veterans (here he goes again!).\nI thoroughly enjoyed the film despite my picky protestations above.",

Fast paced, stylish and vastly entertaining, this is not only a reminder of how insane Tom Cruise\u2019s dedication to delivering big screen thrills is but also a prime example of how movies are originally meant to be watched on the big screen. Christopher McQuarrie makes Fallout feels a lot like the first Mission: Impossiblemovie than any other film in the franchise, but also cleverly takes everything good about the franchise and marinates it all into one movie. The stunts, staged with vigor and a sharp eye for spatial balance by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, grow wilder as Fallout goes on. And, admittedly, they\u2019re a hoot. Cruise brings a work ethic as solid as the movie\u2019s narrative ethic is hectic, generously and subtly conducting an outstanding supporting cast that includes M:I veterans Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. Some of Fallout\u2019s most delicious scenes, though, feature Cruise and Vanessa Kirby, leaving behind her Princess Margaret persona from \u201cThe Crown\u201d to play a fascinatingly saucy minx of indistinct motivation. McQuarrie finally asks what sort of man keeps accepting those missions; what drives someone to put their life on the line again and again? For Hunt, the answer is simple. He can save people, and therefore he has a responsibility to act. For Cruise \u2014 and McQuarrie \u2014 it\u2019s an eternal quest to outdo the last effort. They\u2019re only making the next one difficult by succeeding this hard.",

There is a scene around the start of the movie, where Ethan and Walker skydive down, Walker was struck by a lightning bolt and the scene looked amazing, the sound was spectacular and incredibly realistic, the special effects were also on point. The lighting varied due to different day times in the movie, majority of the scenes were shot during the day time with the sun shining, other parts were shot at nightime. The final scene in the movie was incredible as the scene was gruesome and exiting.\n\nThere were a lot of plot twists throughout the movie and a lot of unexpected scenes, out of 5 stars I would give this wonderful movie a 4.5 out of 5. It was an exceptional film however I think if the crew behind this film can definitely top it.",

The many vehicles in the movie e.g. the fast cars , motorcycles and helicopters make the movie stand out when it comes to action. The several cities they visit in the film e.g. London, Paris and Kashmir make the movie more attractive as these places have good  landscapes and landmarks. I think the sound in movie was superb as it was used at the right time to build up suspense especially in fight scenes. I also really enjoyed the Mission Impossible theme that was going on through the movie as it sounded really nice. I think the performances in the movie were great. Tom Cruise's performance  as Ethan Hunt in the action thriller stands out as earlier in the movie when he saves Luther. This told me that he really cares about the people that are close to him and he wouldn't trade the life of someone he really cares about with the lives of  millions of strangers. The supporting cast also have great performances, Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust an agent who has similar motives with Ethan but their past relationship  gets both of them tangled up in their missions. Henry Cavill has a stellar performance as August Walker/ John Lark is a CIA  Assassin whos mission is to keep an eye on Hunt and his team. There's a great plot twist as if Walker is really cooperating with Hunt or trying to take him down as a double agent. Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell is more of the heart of the team who cares a lot for Ethan and also has some comedic moments. Simon Pegg  as Benji Dunn is more of the tech wizz in the team who also Ethan cares a lot about. He has several comedic moments throughout  the film and is one of the core members of the team.",

It kept me interested throughout the whole film , even though I have never seen any of the previous films the story line in the film was easy to get ahold of and allowed me to get to grips with what is happening . The use of sound effects made the film seem very intense and realistic to what you was watching.  The use of different camera angles and clever editing made the film much very gripping on its own. There is not a boring moment throughout the whole film. \n\nThe mise en scene in the film has a wide range of differences. For example, some parts of the movie are set in major capitals of the world such as London and Paris but towards the end of the film, in the helicopter fight scene , it is set within the outskirts of China, within the snowy mountains.\n\nThe costume worn within the film make it easy to know who is who , for example Ethan Hunt ,played by Tom Cruise, is shown wearing a suit at the start of the film so we know he is an important character to the story. Also the suit hints that he may be James Bond style character, which we soon find out he is.",

Because i was just watching what was happening and i was trying to work out the plot in my head of who's done this and who hasn't. But i do remember they used a lot of mid shots where it would either pan side to side or it would follow the actors/ actress along. They do this because they want your eyes to focus on certain things for example when Solomon Lane is in the helicopter they want you to focus on him because he is going to be a main part of the story. Something else the directors do a lot is a tracking shot where they follow certain characters around to make it look like your with them so you feel like your apart of the story which entices the audience more. Another shot the directors used a lot is a long shot on bits of the film that are suspenseful because they can create a tense atmosphere if it was used right and it was definitely used the right way in this film.",

I believe during this film they have not to appeared to be many green screen shots from watching all the stunts that Tom Cruise has done. As well as it being very suspenseful from the cuts from scenes, which have been moved quickly from one to another. So there is no dull moments in the film. \n\nThe mise-en-scene of the film is that there is a range of interesting settings of all major city, for example London and Paris. There is also a lot of typical secret agent outfits for example suits. The lighting plays a huge part in this film because it changes with the mood of the scene creating an atmosphere, as well as the colour of the surroundings. The camera angles have also created an interesting effect on the film because every scene it has work well will, because of how many camera angles there have to make you feel happy, tension or afraid. For example watching Tom Cruise\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s character Ethan Hunt jump from the plane you see him from below, then above and constantly changing.   \n\nAll round I think the movie was made well and is a great watch for people who enjoy action movies.",

It was one of those few that I wound up chasing all over the state of California, as it left one theater but remained at another, because I wanted to catch every movie showing of it that I could. I had watched the Rogue Nation one, in theaters, over and over again, and this time, my sister joined me for Fallout, trying to catch multiple screenings, on the big screen. As exciting and thrilling as every action sequence was, as mysterious and surprising as every plot twist or double-crossing was, what I appreciated the most about this movie was how much was subtly communicated by a mere raising of an eyebrow, or barely a wink. Slight changes in facial expressions told so much. Perhaps it's just me, but when Sloane describes Walker as \"a hammer\", I wondered if he got his high position, within the CIA, through some kind of sexual act. But that's probably just my dirty mind, there. It took me a few viewings to catch every subtle non-spoken gesture, but when I finally did, the movie became even more entertaining; when the IMF are detaining both Walker and Solomon Lane in cuffs, and then Walker nods, just slightly, towards Solomon Lane, Walker is reassuring Lane that he has completely infiltrated the CIA, so nothing Sloane has ordered will be carried through successfully. When Benji and Luther are glaring; angry at Walker, while cramped into the backseat of the tiny car, it is because it is dawning on them that Walker only secured a car big enough for 4 men, not 5, because he expected Ethan Hunt would've been captured and arrested by that time; framed as John Lark. Then my favorite: Ethan asks Julia if her husband, Eric, knows who he is, and Julia quickly shakes her head \"no\", but as Ethan and Eric talk to each-other, it becomes clear that Eric DOES know who Ethan is, that Eric HAS heard of Ethan. Julia only denied that because she is trying to protect Eric from the same danger that she and Ethan have constantly found themselves in, because of who Ethan is. At the end, when Ethan is in a hospital tent, and Eric advises Ethan not to move, and he tells him that Sloane had arrived \"right in front of half the Indian army\", he adds: \"See you later, Doc,\" and he winks at Ethan. It's so quick, don't blink or you'll miss it. Eric is making it clear: by that time, he has figured out who Ethan is. In a few of the earlier scenes, Eric seems a little bit uncomfortable or he has a very concerned expression on his face, but his concern is that Ethan's presence signals danger to himself and his wife. He knows that enemies of Ethan have tried to harm Julia before. No matter what draws you to this movie, whether it's the very dangerous action scenes, the death-defying stunts, the love story, the mystery and suspense, it totally satisfies on all levels. I also truly appreciate the messages regarding morality and empathy. As always, Ethan Hunt is a fearless, boundless gentleman; a total class act.",

Other stuff acts in same spectacular way. Especially I'd highlight work of Ving Rhames and Rebekka Fergusson. Characters played by them are round and convincing.\nThe plot is not overcomplicated but extremely gripping. This is what good blockbuster should be.

As a pure action film, it's one of the finest I've seen this year. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie clearly understands that, for action to be exciting, it must first be comprehensible. The chase sequences are beautifully shot and assembled, and I could often feel my fists tightening when the heroes we're close to danger, they're that tense. It does frequently suffer from Fast & Furious Syndrome, the term I've devised to describe characters who are so immune from damage and death that's there's never any reason to worry about them, and the films plot is a bad combination of old hat and swerve-obsessed. Admittedly some of the twists are pretty funny, but the film is constantly trying to make it seem like everyone is a bad guy at some point and it quickly becomes tiresome. But aside from that, and its assortment of often frustratingly ambiguous spy movie dialogue, it's a tonne of fun, and more than worth watching for the action sequences alone.",

Sono queste ultime le protagoniste assolute della qualit\u00e0 della pellicola, con un lavoro sugli stunt che ha semplicemente dell'incredibile. Ovviamente grande del merito va a Tom Cruise, una vera leggenda vivente che ci regala delle scene straordinarie che disintegrano qualsiasi forma di concorrenza, evitando gli effetti speciali e privilegiando reali scene d'azione che lasciano letteralmente a bocca aperta anche lo spettatore pi\u00f9 esperto.

            "content": "Mission Impossible: Fallout is a masterfully made film and it deserves to be regarded as one of the finest action movies ever made. Fallout is a thrilling, well thought out movie by Christopher McQuarrie. \n\nTom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt again with a great performance. He is not only impressive (with the major set pieces Fallout presents) but he is also plays believable character. As far as the characterization of Ethan Hunt, Fallout proves to be the best version of him yet. Ethan has to make tough choices to save what matters to him and it often comes at a cost. He has regrets, fears, and he makes mistakes despite his experience in the field and unique set of skills. Hunt's depth adds much more to this film than any previous entry before it. \n\nIn a sense, this is more a of a spy movie than a typical Mission Impossible movie. Instead of the story being built around the set pieces, the set pieces fit more organically into the film. The antagonist has more of a reason to exist in Fallout than just as a big bad to kill. His reasoning is flawed, but he has complex reasons for doing what he does. Our villain is a genuinely terrifying and serves as an equal to the godlike skills of someone such Ethan Hunt. \n\nThe returning team members are a welcome sight. The Mission Impossible Franchise has had a difficult time with continuity. Aside from Cruise,  the cast is constantly being shaken up in each movie. Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and Michelle Monaghan are highlights as returning members of the supporting cast. All them play central roles in the plot and to Ethan's character. This movie also goes out of its way to make connections to the rest of the franchise, which is a nice shoutout the earlier movies. \n\nHenry Cavill gets to spread his wings with August Walker, the CIA agent forced to work with Ethan. Cavill is powerful in his stature and performance. He demonstrates another level to his acting skills that I never saw until Fallout. He plays Walker perfectly. \n\nMission Impossible Fallout is by far the best film in a franchise that continues to improve with each entry. Between the stellar cast and excellent script, this movie serves as an example for what action movies should aspire to be: gripping, deep, and unforgettable.",

The improbable (dare I say impossible?) sequence with the fifteen minute countdown seemed to last a half hour at least.  I liked how Cruise (ageless at 56) sometimes gets knocked down or fails in this one, and the stunning shots in Kashmir.  It's a summer blockbuster that filmgoers lapped up like ice cream, and it's entertaining enough as it trots out all the usual tropes.

Lots of bad guys (hard to keep track of all of them), and so many twists and turns, that it makes following the plot, quite challenging.

The action scenes were as good as you hear, but how many times can you watch poor Tom jump out of a building, fall three stories, shake it off and then start running like a marathon runner trying to catch the bad guy who always seems to have a helicopter waiting.   \n  In sum, this movie will be a pleasant diversion for you, but don't stand in line to see it.",

Now i DIDN'T really like rogue nation too much and the only MI movie i saw besides that was mi: 3 which i was a fantastically done masterpiece. i wasn't expecting it to be great, but to just be a fun action experience. what i got was a fantastic story, masterfully done stunts, beautiful SET PIECES, and a twist i kinda knew was going to happen but still shocked me.\nI totally recommend this film to anyone who like fun action, stunts and STORYLINES that are COHERENT.",

My answer is, yes, and not only that but its the best in the series and one of the best action movies of all time. I was constantly at the edge of my seat, I got the jokes and the action sequenses were amazing. The thing with this movie and all the movies in the series is that when you see Tom Cruise hanging under a helicopter, he is actually doing it, so the adrenaline is at its highest. The car chases and movements were very realistic. The casting was perfect and the storyline fantastic. The 3rd act could be the best 3rd act I have seen in a movie for a very long time. I have nothing bad to say about this movie. 5/5 stars",

            "content": "I've always had kind of a love/hate relationship with the Mission Impossible series to be honest.  On one hand, the original Mission Impossible was easily one of the best blockbusters of the 90's and it was an interesting slow-burn thriller in addition to having memorable set pieces.  (And they were memorable.  Name one quote or location from the sequels that stood out without looking it up.  Brian De Palma knew his craft.)  And one must admire the practical effects the series has become known for.  Tom Cruise does seem to court death when making these, insisting to do almost every stunt himself.  But I honestly do not particularly care for the sequels.  An issue, it seems, on which I am probably alone.  Many have noted how the sequels are outlandish fun and embrace the inherent wackiness of the spy genre.  At the same time Bond got more serious and in touch with his Ian Fleming roots, Mission Impossible went NUTS and audiences rewarded the franchise for it.  Impossible seems to have a similar trajectory and fanbase to the Fast and the Furious series, with each movie getting progressively more over-the-top.  Both are self-aware of how ridiculous the whole thing has gotten.  But that's okay.  YOU are in on the joke.  \n\nThe most recent iteration, Mission Impossible: Fallout surprisingly has no power armor, Vault-Tec, super mutants, or Pip-Boys.  (Bad joke.  Sorry.)  No, you already know the gist of these movies.  The plot is essentially meaningless.  Blah, blah, blah, infiltrate bad guys.  Blah, blah, blah, doublecross.  Blah, Blah, Blah, nukes.  Blah, blah, blah, we've got to get the detonator before everyone dies.  You are here for the set pieces and to watch the Space Pope run from explosions and hang out of planes and helicopters in peril.  This movie is a direct sequel to Fallout: Rogue Nation, so it may have helped to have seen that movie and remembered something about it.  (Good luck with that.)  That being said, the series does have some great recurring characters at this point (such as Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson) whose supporting performances do add quite a bit of humor and occasional drama.  There is a bit of a return to old world spy craft and a retreat from the sci-fi tech of the previous two movies, which is a welcome change.  Tom Cruise commits totally, as mentioned before, and he is allowed several good scenes with different actors, including an enthusiastic Henry Cavill.  Many have called this \"the best action movie of the year.\"  To me, this wouldn't sound accurate even if there wasn't plenty of 2018 to go.  But it may be the best rental movie of 2018.  So yes, while it may not be my cup of tea, Mission Impossible: Fallout would make a perfectly adequate rental or streaming option, should you choose to accept it.",

It kind of reminds me of the trajectory of Fast & Furious movies: the first one is fine, the second one is terrible, the third one I skipped, and after that they finally started to find their groove.  In terms of story, it is mostly your standard spy thriller stuff, which honestly I'm not always the biggest fan of.  I like spy movies fine, I especially like watching the spies work and use all their gadgets and just do their job, but when it comes to their convoluted plots it's a little hard for me to get invested.  Again, this was a drawback for me in Fallout.  The core of the story works fine, but some of the little detours to get their felt unnecessary, and there was a twist that I saw coming since the first trailer.  Also without going too deep into spoilers, how many times is Mission Impossible going to deal with a double crossing agent?  These issues aside, the story still works for the most part because the characters work.  The villain's motivations do seem straight up psychotic, but when you hears his explanation you do kind of see where he's coming from.  I mean it's still psychotic and you know he needs to be stopped, but you understand how he got to that point.  It addresses the toll of Ethan Hunt's career on his personal life (which almost seems meta to Tom Cruise now that I think about it), and while I miss Jeremy Renner it's nice to see Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg returning and their team chemistry is just as good as ever.\nEnough about all that though, how's the action?  It's Mission Impossible, it's great.  These movies have become known for having some of the best action ever for use of practical effects, no stunt doubles, and the very real possibility Tom Cruise might die.  There were a few scenes where I found myself looking for the wires or looking for the edges for the green screen or CGI, and I couldn't find it; so either it was all real or they did a damn good job of making it look real.  In either case, kudos.  It's also the type of action that is godamn relentless almost to the point of parody.  It pushes things right up to the edge; literally, if there's a scene by a cliff where something has a chance of falling you bet your ass it will tumble right to the godamn corner of that that Cliffside.  The movie pushes you and pushes and pushes and then pulls back just a little bit only to push one final time.  It's godamn artistry in tension.  It's that perfect sort of tension where, hey, we know this type of movie, we have a pretty good idea that the good guys are going to win, but we're still tense every step of the way.  There's scenes where I'm thinking \"I know Tom Cruise can't die because he's in more way scenes in the trailer, we're only halfway through the movie, and he's godamn Tom Cruise, so why am I so worried about him right now?\".  It's an impressive level of tension that reminded me of Spielberg at his best moments.  Mind you it's not quite up to that same level, but that I'm even considering that comparison is godamn impressive.\nBottom line, Mission Impossible: Fallout is just a near perfect spy movie.  My biggest complaints come from the fact that it's a bit too long, and while I enjoyed it all it did start to wear on me, and the fact that spy stories just don't always draw me in personally.  If spy stories are your thing though, there's not much better.  I still loved the movie mind you, it's about as good a spy movie as I could ever hope to see.  I love the team, I love seeing these people work, and it's some of the best practical action I've ever seen.",

            "content": "The Mission Impossible movies have sure taken a weird trajectory.  It kind of reminds me of the trajectory of Fast & Furious movies: the first one is fine, the second one is terrible, the third one I skipped, and after that they finally started to find their groove.  In terms of story, it is mostly your standard spy thriller stuff, which honestly I'm not always the biggest fan of.  I like spy movies fine, I especially like watching the spies work and use all their gadgets and just do their job, but when it comes to their convoluted plots it's a little hard for me to get invested.  Again, this was a drawback for me in Fallout.  The core of the story works fine, but some of the little detours to get their felt unnecessary, and there was a twist that I saw coming since the first trailer.  Also without going too deep into spoilers, how many times is Mission Impossible going to deal with a double crossing agent?  These issues aside, the story still works for the most part because the characters work.  The villain's motivations do seem straight up psychotic, but when you hears his explanation you do kind of see where he's coming from.  I mean it's still psychotic and you know he needs to be stopped, but you understand how he got to that point.

The action is really great, it's pulse pounding and well choreographed. But the plot is just so generic and predictable. Every time someone's face is revealed it feels like it was telegraphed a mile away, and the story is about them trying to stop an ex-spy with a personal vendetta who is going to set off some nukes. I'm pretty sure there are like five James Bond movies with that exact plot. \n\nI think a big part of the hype was the whole thing about Tom Cruise actually flying the helicopter, but it didn't really add anything. The way they captured the action with stationary cameras actually made it feel less real to me. Like if they had shot it on a green screen it wouldn't have made a difference. They never got one great shot that made it all worth it. It reminds me of Boyhood; a mediocre film praised for it's production rather than it's actual content. Not that Fallout is as bad as Boyhood. It is good. Far too long, but good. I loved the washroom fight, Simon Pegg is always a joy to watch. It had a really good balance of humour and action and I'm probably being way to harsh on it.

It raises the bar for every action film that is to come. \nTom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt once again and in this film he is absolutely incredible, running, jumping, climbing, diving. This is greatest stunt performance ever by an actor. It took him years to learn to do the HALO jump for this film, and in doing so is the first actor ever to record on camera. It is absolutely breathting. Not even a broken ankle stops Cruise at the age of 56. It is unreal.\nDirector Christopher McQuarie returns for his second Mission: Impossible film after 2015's \"Rogue Nation\" and \"Fallout\" is easily better. Not to take anything away from \"Rogue Nation\". \"Fallout\" is McQuarie's best film to date and is leaving me curious if another Mission: Impossible film will grace the screen and if McQuarie and Cruise will return if there is.\nThe script is simply downright badass and awesome. Cruise and company deliver every line with power and confidence. Written solo\nby McQaurie the script also holds many details and callbacks to the previous films which are interesting and cool to\nsee. Henry Cavill and Sean Harris are ideal villains as members of the Syndicate. They both seem fearless, determined, and incredibly difficult to stop. \nIn the end, \"Fallout\" takes your breath away time and time again. Giving you faith in all summer blockbusters, it was totally worth the wait. Your mission should you choose to accept is to read this review and see \"Mission: Impossible-Fallout\" now!",

Unrealistic premises aside, this is actually a really good action movie. For me, it's still not up to par with 2011's Ghost Protocol, but you can't deny the pure unadulterated entertainment of this movie. The film is a fantastic mix of intrigue and action, and you have to pay attention to keep everything straight, there is a lot going on and the plot points get pretty muddled. Just trying to keep up with who is on whose side was enough to make my head spin. The nearly constant action sequences serve nicely to distract you from the less than seamless story. The movie is packed with car chases (sponsored by BMW!), foot chases, fights, and incredible stunts (sponsored by Tom Cruise!). As with Rogue Nation, the players have changed a bit, but as long as Benji (Simon Pegg) is still part of the team, I'm in - he is the heart of these movies, and they wouldn't work without him. Jeremy Renner's Brandt has been unceremoniously deleted without explanation this go-round (in the same way Paula Patton was omitted without fanfare after Ghost Protocol), but Henry Cavill is a worthy replacement as good/bad guy Walker. This dude has swag that he has never shown as Superman, and most of the time, I was rooting for him. Now I understand why Cavill refused to shave his mustache for the Justice League reshoots... this is a meatier role in a worthier movie. The film's weak point is its length - it's too long, and by the time the climactic action sequence rolls around, you're kind of numb to it all. But with every installment, this franchise has been more and more successful at blending the spy thriller with the action movie, which makes these movies rise above the standard \"shoot 'em up\" popcorn flick to become a truly satisfying movie-going experience.",

            "content": "\"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is a marvel to the action genre which not only proved that any form of film can be hailed as a masterpiece, but also was a main catalyst in reforming the Academy's bias towards blockbusters. While a Popular Film category might be a sorry excuse to exclude movies like this from the Best Picture category, it's a start. Nearly every action scene in this movie was perfectly executed. The biggest problem I have with many action movies such as this is that they have a hard time immersing people, at least the people I know, into the action. I have a hard time grasping the stakes and how tense each moment is. However, this film not only immerses me into the action, it makes my heart race and forms goosebumps on my skin. During the skydiving scene, I legitimately felt as if I were tens of thousands of feet in the air. I believe the gem of this film is the bathroom scene as each movement feels important. Each punch, kick, etc. knocks back characters and harms them, it's also just precisely choreographed and feels very well-paced, which I think is something most action scenes lack. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece and everyone should see this film now!",

In regards to the Mission Impossible movies I like almost all of them except 2 but this has to be the best in the series. The plot maybe an issue for some people as its a bit hard to follow if you don't pay attention but I like the fact that the movie is not just a collection of mindless action sequences but it requires you to invest in the plot. The issue with the mission impossible movies has often been the villain but here we got the second best antagonist in the series after Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character in MI 3.

The movie kept me entertained and the story moves along perfect.  Building up to the final scene which was very intense.  I had to watch this movie 2 times and I can't wait till it comes out on DVD or digital download.  The movie 147 minutes, but it really doesn't feel like a long movie.  The only one thing I can honestly point out and say \"I did not like it\".  Was the extended Tom Cruise running.  I think that is the only thing that they could have cut some time on.  Oh and Rebecca Ferguson is perfect in this movie and I was happy she reprised her role.",

All of the Star Wars movies .. WTF!!) when the first movie only managed 64%. What the utter F*#^k. Does anyone else think it's a co incidence that the ratings for mission impossible franchise have rapidly increased over the years ..\nThe acting is shit, the plot makes 0 sense and even the action sequences are poor- except the one where Tom cruise actually broke his leg in real life- maybe he was actually trying to jump off that building before this hit the cinemas ..\nIf you want to watch an action spoof go and watch Macruber- which is intentionally trying to make fun at action movies.

            "content": "The sixth entry in the long-running series, Mission: Impossible-Fallout continues the films' running streak of escalating quality in action, direction, and presentation. Every aspect of Fallout feels like it's been polished up since the last film, resulting in an unrelenting, adrenaline-soaked thrill ride that never fails to impress with every new scenario and set piece. \nA nice touch to Fallout is that it uniquely brandishes itself as a true sequel to many of the past films in the franchise. Apart from some recurring characters such as Simon Pegg's Benji and Ving Rhames' Luther,  the films have mostly played themselves out as a series of standalone episodes in relation to each other. Fallout makes some notable connections to Ethan's previous missions, especially the last entry, Rogue Nation. The Apostles are a natural extension of Rogue Nation's Syndicate, and Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin, and Sean Harris' reprised roles, as well as the first returning director in the series, Christopher McQuarrie, give the film a pleasantly weighty boost in continuity. The film also works perfectly well as a stand-alone, to boot. \nAlso returning is Tom Cruise's unmatched vigor for the action hero role-it's clear how much Cruise relishes the part as he yells, runs, jumps, and shoots across the screen with all his might. His genuine, all-in attitude continues to play a large part in selling the character and the franchise as a whole.\nFurthermore, Cruise's fearless stunt work is elevated to the nth degree through McQuarrie's direction and Rob Hardy's breathtaking cinematography. McQuarrie's mature style carries over from Rogue Nation with engaging, beautifully crafted visuals that few action films ever allow themselves to present. The stiller moments always have something going for them, and when bullets start flying, the film has some of the best action in the series, bar none. \nFeaturing a mesmerizing HALO jump shot in long takes, a brutal, close-quarters bathroom fight, one of the best car chases put to film, and topped with a high-tension helicopter brawl, everything looks real because it is real; there's no trace of computer-generated embellishment to the ridiculous stunt work done in camera. Fallout is a true achievement in pure, practical filmmaking, and alongside 2015's equally ambitious Mad Max: Fury Road, it goes to show how much better movies can turn out when done with this very real level of effort.\nOn another, gripier note, Fallout lacks any trace of depth of substance apart from its mind-blowing action. It's not like it needs it; the film delivers exactly what it promises with masterful execution. It's also the longest entry in the series at nearly two-and-a-half hours, but that's also not as much a complaint as it is another observation. \nMission: Impossible-Fallout is another fantastic addition to the series that takes the already high bar set by its predecessors and sets it another two pegs higher.",

This movie has a crazy amount of stunts and action scenes and a very small amount of CGI (mainly weather effects and gunshots). All stunts are real and you definitely worry for the hero because you know he had to do all of that for real. Interesting point is that there were 2 big actions scenes which didn't have any music and it definitely felt different and I noticed that. This movie definitely feels different and it was amazing to watch it, I had a lot of great emotions. Tom Cruise is as always amazing, the amount of work and risk he put into this movie is more than most actors do in their entire career. He's definitely an example for other actors and hopefully more actors will start making movies with a similar dedication. I watched this movie in 4DX format and it made it even more realistic, I definitely recommend it. After that I watched it twice more in 2D.\n\nThis movie has really a lot of stunts. Amazing halo jump scene, fighting scene, shooting scene, motorbike chase scene, car chase scene, amazing intense TC running scene, helicopter chase scene...

They said Tom Cruise did a dangerous stunt without safety  measures in the making of this, putting his life on the line. Did that make the movie better? Well.....maybe. it was a good scene BUT fairly short compared to the overall length of movie.Was it worth it? I think not. Keep your star alive to make another movie. Yeah he lived this time but  what about next time? \n\nWhy? Who knows. I'm guessing adrenaline junkie. I'm guessing there may be good therapy for that. Dunno. Before doing it again, there is a good question to ask: who needs you?",

            "content": "There isn't much left to say about \"Mission Impossible: Fallout.\" While overall it's not quite as great of a film as you've heard, it rates an A+ when it comes to rousing action. The practical stunts are hair-raising, and it's far and away the best film in the franchise. You likely do not need any convincing to go see this blockbuster, but I will encourage you to head to the theaters immediately to watch this on the biggest screen possible.\n\nIt's frantic and fun, setting the bar high for mainstream action films. Featuring what are arguably some of the best action sequences in modern cinema history, the movie is also dazzling to look at with its grand scale cinematography. When the clock starts ticking, there's a thrilling sense of real danger - especially when Tom Cruise himself is dangling from a helicopter. It's a visual stunner that isn't burdened with flashy CGI effects, which in itself is refreshing.\n\nCruise, who famously does most of his own stunts, shows that he's never too old to be a credible action hero. His Ethan Hunt is flawed, but that only serves to make him more relatable to the rest of us. He's one of America's last true movie stars, and he outdoes himself here. The likable supporting players (Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames) are sadly still playing second fiddle, with the exception of Henry Cavill as a tagalong CIA suit.\n\nA perfect film it's not, but it's awfully easy to overlook the problems (a textbook story, the draggy length, some nonsensical plot holes, Alec Baldwin's distracting and shouty non-performance) because this movie is all about one thing: the thrilling action scenes. There are so many that are so well done it becomes impossible to choose a favorite, although I could watch the motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris and the bloody bathroom fistfight scenes once a week and never tire of the artistry in the stunt work.\n\nAnd that's what audiences will flock to see. The plot doesn't really play a significant factor in the creative (if mostly unbelievable) story, and its twists grow from \"wow, that's cool\" to ridiculous eye-rolling whoppers. No true lover of action films will care, because my review of this movie could easily be nothing more than two words: \"buckle up.\"\n\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW",

At this stage, this is truly a pleasant surprise, and despite feeling a tad heavy on the plot exposition, it is full of so much practical stunt work and chase sequences echoing classics from 'The French Connection' to Nolan's 'Batman' series, some on-point charm and humour, and stunning location shooting, it's still a joy. In time, the extended sequence of Tom Cruise running around London's rooftops and bridges will be a staple-point in cinema. It may not carry the same ground-breaking weight as Gene Hackman driving after a train at full speed, but it is very similar to that scene in spirit, and carries in its DNA the same sense of gritted determination (As with Hackman's Doyle, you really are rooting for Ethan all the way!), as well as showing off a post-millennium London in beautiful, proud glory, so as to make for a classic moment in film history - Guaranteed!",

As per usual, Simon Pegg's Bengi Dunn is delivering hilarious lines but also has a new layer of depth to him. Christopher McQuarrie proves yet again that he is the master of action filmmaking.

With Hardy capturing some spectacular wide-shots and Hamilton/McQuarrie cutting sequences together in such a way that they don't become exhausting but remain exhilarating all the way through.\n\nAs for Cruise, he is great and believable as always, but if you're looking for a deep character study, this isn't the film for you.\n\nTo sum it up: I can see some people getting turned off by the story but other than that there is no excuse not to see this film.",

The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, and the plot is driven by a series of arbitrary situations, predictably explained and then solved by our hero.  The situations, twists, and solutions are equally out of the blue and ridiculous.  The reveals in the larger plot are sadly circular and self-referential - it turns out that office politics, petty revenge, and incompetence are the main motivators.  I had some hopes for this movie because the trailer seemed to be playing up a lot of stumbles by Ethan Hunt, but that feeling didn't make it into the movie; instead he is a demi-god that can literally do any physical, mental, or skill-based task better than anyone...and that's pretty boring.

Claro, todo esto logrado gracias al ojo y pluma de Christopher McQuarrie, el primer director y guionista que repite su trabajo en la franquicia.\nEn esta nueva entrega Ethan junto con sus compa\u00f1eros de la agencia de espionaje FMI deben evitar que unos terroristas an\u00e1rquicos conocidos como Los Ap\u00f3stoles consigan plutonio para la creaci\u00f3n de peligrosas bombas.

My wife and I groaned outloud, and as Kirk used to say, we then knew we were \"boldy going where no man/woman has gone before\" into a land of sheer stupidity determined by stunts and not story, and scene after scene with a total lack of storytelling (just like Infinity Wars - suppose this is what people think is good movie making today?), just a compiled cuts of mismosh predictable dialogue written by a thirteen year old, and fifteen or so actors portending that their steely fake looks into camera counts as acting? We think Tom Cruise's awesome stunts and all the planning involved distracted everyone from having a true and real story, and somehow no one noticed - not even the director apparently? - that the great question of 'why do we care' appears rarely asked in modern day action cinema; if it was, this had the visual chops and misused cast in order to make a story that keeps you in your seat no matter what! Instead I opted for a bathroom break, and another trip for ice cream and a beer, and missed nothing but sleepy and obvious dialogue by talented people sing like a sweet lullaby  . . yeah in the end and last few minutes (wife laughed \"what a climatic ending' *sarcasm) I actually fell asleep. Please save your money and miss this one in theaters; the action on a big screen does not make up for this movies 'fullout' stupity. Rent in November for $3 and be done with this trashwork.

            "content": "Not since the 1988 revival of the TV series has Mission Impossible shown its age.  The MI movies have been going at it for 22 years now-so long, in fact, that Metallica's infamous Napster lawsuit, which is forever tied to this franchise, is nearing its 20th anniversary.  Today, Tom Cruise & Ving Rhames are getting old.  Like, Roger Moore in A View to a Kill old.  It seems like the franchise might need to be revamped with a younger face once again sooner or later.  But if that were the case, then Fallout would be a pretty high note to go out on.\n\nMission Impossible 6 is one of the grittiest movies in the franchise, comparable to JJ Abrams' MI-3.  For a film series noted for its fast-paced action sequences, this one is one of the slowest as well-it puts more emphasis on the espionage and the trickery rather than the wall-to-wall action, like in other installments.  Nevertheless, there is enough intrigue going about to keep the audience gripped the whole time, plus some very interesting and unexpected twists and turns in the plot.  Not to mention that there is a \"quality over quantity\" approach to its action sequences, which make for the action sequences that do happen being true jaw-droppers to behold.\n\nRemember Ilsa Faust and the villainous Lane from the last movie?  They're back in this one, and arguably, their arcs in this one are even better than last time.  For once, we get a greater depth into Lane's character, and Ilsa has arguably the most fascinating character arc in this picture.  And then there's the other real scene-stealer: Henry Cavill as the mysterious August Walker.  Even though you can see where is arc is going at hindsight, HC executes it in a way that makes you want to see him do it.  I can't spoil much about his character, but it does take a fascinating turn.\n\nHowever, I can say this: Henry Cavill is rocking one of the sickest beards to ever grace the movie screen.  Seriously!  The next time you go to a showing of this movie, wait for the moment Henry Cavill graces the screen for the first time, and listen closely.  You could hear at least one fangirl shrieking in the theater at the mere sight of Cavill's manly mustache, combined with that neat suit that he's wearing.  He's a chick magnet of the Draco in Leather Pants variety (see TV Tropes for what that means), the kind of bad boy that'll make fangirls in the audience lose their minds when they gaze their eyes upon him.  His beard is so cool, in fact, that DC Entertainment could only shave his face with CGI for Justice League.  That's how fucking manly he looks!\n\nThen there's the climax-one of the tensest and most breathtaking climaxes in this whole series.  Never have stakes so grave been set in such a unique locale for the finale on a scale that seems so small yet actually so great.  Only one facet of this climax features grand spectacle, but the other half is literally a grungy gut-punch.  For a PG-13 flick, half of the final fight got quite dark at times, which only made the tension even higher.  It is the kind of rewarding finale that punctuates Mission Impossible 6's continuation of the franchise's hot streak after all this time.\n\nFinal verdict:\nIs Mission Impossible 6 great?  FUCK YEAH!",

Layer on top some nuanced performances, such as Vanessa Kirby as the devilishly naughty White Widow.

Do you look at Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt as an evolving and aging character like Jason Bourne or as an ageless character like James Bond? Taken on its own, this movie is an incredibly entry in the world of action. Christopher McQuarrie is now adept at framing his shots and using the camera movement to add motion and kinetic energy to chase and fight scenes. Cruise, as usual, is impressive as a man constantly on the move. Henry Cavill (and his mustache) is a memorable antagonist in this entry. \n\nBut over the years, we have had to raise the bar on our expectations, not just from an action movie, but from a Mission: Impossible movie. Rogue Nation was spectacular, with smart writing and wonderful addition in Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa. Here, the actions of John Lark don't seem to stand up to scrutiny when put alongside his goals. Throughout the movie, I was asking myself over and over \"if he wanted this to happen, then why did he do this...?\" I was hoping for a payoff, but that never came, meaning that the villain is more incompetent than he should have been. That disappointment is enough to bring my rating down a few notches. Here's hoping that the next installment is better.",

The plot: who cares! In this type of film the plot is always sheer pretense pulp escapism dressed up in the style of greyscale, upmarket fashion editorial, with a bit of macho nonsense here and there about weapons, bikes, clues, technology etc. The action sequences are great, and there's a few good bits of dialogue, but keep in mind this film is essentially about an escape-anything spy fighting a global, unknown killer with a plan to use a deadly nuclear bomb somehow. ie: mindless generic cheese given a reboot thanks to tight editing, breakneck action sequences and, yeah, chunks of ideas shamelessly lifted from other movies, some less than a decade out of circulation.",

            "content": "Loud, unappolagetic, sleek, and sometimes gimmicky. Everything you'd want from an action movie is here and then some.\nWhy don't more movies lean into themselves the way Mission Impossible does? I can't call myself a diehard action fan, a Tom Cruise enthusiast, or even someone that's seen every MI film-yet I loved every second of Mission Impossible: Fallout. There isn't a dull moment in the movie, and it doesn't seem to run out of steam at any point. At several points when you think Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has \"The Apostles\" cornered, the action ramps back up again, and the team reconvenes. When a movie is the 6th installment, like MI6, it's important the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and director Brian De Palma tiptoes that line very effectively. The cold-open was one of the best, and most fun I've ever seen in an action movie, as Cruise conspires with Wolf Blitzer to trick a terrorist into surrendering his phone using a fake newscast. When the walls to the fake hospital room raised at the end of the hijinx, there was a involuntary smile on the face of everyone in the theatre-we were in.\n\nThere a really poignant, and politically appropriate moment near the end of Mission Impossible where Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is asked if they should involve the CIA in their plan to save the world. Ethan replies bluntly \"the only people I trust are the the 4 people in this room\". There's certainly a comedic undertone to this scene-but it encapsulated how a lot of people are feeling right now on both sides of the isle in Trump's america: like they're just not sure who to trust. As with any action movie worth it's weight, MI6 features four separate twists where characters double-cross each other, and you're completely unsure who is on what side. The difference for MI: Fallout versus it's lesser counterparts is that the situations and gadgetry used are just believable enough that you could image this happening in thirty years, but not so hyper realistic that the audience gets caught in the bureaucratic weeds.\n\nThe stunts in this film are genuinely inventive, and the gut-wrenching helicopter scene is something seldom attempted in action movies. Apparently Cruise spent 2,000 hours learning to fly helicopters, and had cameras specifically designed to show he was truly the one flying the copter - and that the stunts were real during the chase. Say what you want about Tom's ego (which undoubtedly factored into that decision) but the dedication and end result were legitimately impressive.\n\nThe Good: It's really fun to spend an hour and a half with Tom Cruise for Mission Impossible: Fallout, and that's something I never imagined myself writing. The stunts are inventive, the jokes are timely and well delivered, and the plot moved quickly and deliberately though two and a half hours. Say what you want about Cruise's involvement with scientology - but the man is very good at making action flicks, transgressions aside. Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby were also excellent is supporting roles, and probably deserved even more screen time than they got.\n\nThe Bad: As much fun as MI6 was, there's a strange and unnecessary ten minutes that seems to get added to every Cruise film, and it was again included here. These ten minutes feature a slough of beautiful women approaching Cruise while biting down on their lips with lust, and read lines borrowed from a lifetime achievement award introduction speech. In regards to MI6: it just made no sense why such a sequence was necessary-the audience had just watched a heroic helicopter chase where cruise narrowly beats a 15 second bomb clock and saves the world. We already have a deep understanding of the sexual tension between Ferguson and Cruise because of several other sequences in the movie that alluded to their past.",

But Tom Cruise has provided us with a sequence of impossible missions ever better than the other.\n\nIn fact, there is no mystery to creating the films of the serie. It's a killer cake recipe that mixes absurd scenes, twists in the script, betrayals, a simple story explained right away (almost always the good guy has to stop the villain in his attempt to dominate or destroy the world), some surprises and Tom Cruise defying death.\n\nAnd every movie your Ethan Hunt seems to be over the edge. This is how we want it. This is how we like it.\n\nThe great mystery even of \"Mission Impossible\" is like the 56 year old actor has the breath and willingness to do so much exercise! In \"Fallout Effect\", Tom Cruise runs UNBELIEFLY for London with rooftop jumps, stars in an impressive chase scene in the streets of Paris, pilots a helicopter and suffers an accident that would kill anyone in Kashmir. And still fight with Superman! All this having to climb a mountain at the end to save a third of the planet. China, India and Pakistan are grateful for their dedication.\n\nNo wonder Luther (Ving Rhames) says, \"This is my man!\" \n\n\"Fallout Effect\" is that classic spy story Hunt style. There is a traitor in the agency, you have to find a terrorist, you have to prevent plutonium bombs from killing humanity. In the midst of all this, there is the Syndicate, a group of terrorists who have been demobilized since the arrest of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).\n\nThe situation in Washington is also not very good. The IMF is questioned after Ethan lets out the plutonium warheads to save his friends Luther and Benji (Simon Pegg). Because of this, the CIA decides to put the stick on the table and say \"now it's my way\". Thus, they recruit the mustachioed agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to be Hunt's shadow and act more assertively on the mission.\n\nFrom there the plot develops in that climate everyone distrusts everyone. Even more so after Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) comes full of mysteries saying she can not say anything, she can not say anything. \"But trust me.\" Ilsa, this is a world of spies. You do not even trust the shade.\n\n\"Mission Impossible: Fallout Effect\" is guaranteed fun and keeps the Ethan Hunt franchise alive. It remains to be seen how Tom Cruise will be able to take risks in ever more surreal scenes. Especially since each film seems to have to set new limits. Or keep the previous ones.",

The plot takes you on lots of betrayal and not knowing who to trust. They did the same thing like in Xmen Origins where they rescue some guy and then ends up not worth it at all because he goes rogue. The ending is very predictable and you know exactly what is going to happen. And the 1 on 1 battle at the end just used mostly CG and was crap compared to the finale from Mission Impossible 2.

After all, few movie franchises succeed beyond their first three films and its main star, Tom Cruise, is now 56, a time when most people start dreaming of retirement. Yet MI: Fallout feels original, fresh and youthful, arguably the best MI movie yet.\nThe premise of the film is not too complicated - bad guys steal nuclear weapon fuel, good guys try to get it back. It's an old chestnut that has been the basis for plenty of action films, including the rival Bond series. Thankfully, MI: Fallout takes an original route, cleverly sculpting characters and elements from the preceding film (Rouge Nation) into a new storyline that explores the fallout from the actions of the Impossible Missions Force. It is sometimes hard to know who is a good guy and who is a bad guy, but there are plenty of clues hidden in the film to help you work it out.\nDirector Chris McQuarrie brings a touch of James Bond glamour to many of the scenes and Lorne Balfe has crafted a rousing music score that perfectly supports the various scenes.\nThe non-stop incredible action sequences are the heart of this movie and they will have you clutching your seat in angst. Cruise's decision to perform many of the action sequences as his own stunt double (just like he did in previous films) definitely pays off, giving plenty of realism to the film. You are left wondering if he was born without a sense of heights. The filmmakers have left the footage taken when Cruise jumped between two buildings, actually breaking his ankle on set, in the final movie. The cutaway shot of him limping away immediately afterwards is painful to watch (though not as painful as it would have been for Mr Cruise), but it just sums up how much Tom Cruise was willing to give to make this film as good as it can be.\nMission Impossible: Fallout is a great ride from start to finish. If MI: Fallout is anything to go by, it is clear there is plenty of life left in this franchise (they are up to the 26th Bond film, which is still going strong). Five stars.",

Although a big fan of Tom Cruise, I did not expect at all such high Rotten Tomatoes score for this latest installment of the \"Mission Impossible\" series as I believe that it is indeed an impossible mission to renovate such a formulaic approach to the action genre and deeply traditional action hero like Ethan Hunt. It turned out that I am totally right, as the film has a hilariously confusing script full of plot-holes and over-complicated twist-and-turns that contribute nothing to character development, especially of the villains, which remain the weakest link in any \"Mission Impossible\" film. For example, Henry Cavill's character was hyped up as a worthy villain of Ethan Hunt, but his capabilities and behaviors just fluctuated throughout the film to the point that the audience could not decide whether he really is a villain of superior intellectual and physical mights or just a henchman with a mediocre skill set. Also, it is necessary to differentiate this film from an action film with intentionally simple plot (in order to solely focus on the actions) like \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", since Christopher McQuarrie did try to make this film more substantial, plot-wise, with a lengthy sub-plot about Ethan Hunt's private life, which turned out to be too cheesy to be effective, several under-developed sub-plots (about \"The Apostles\") and characters (like the \"White Widow\"), and one half-hearted utilization of the \"nuclear fallout\" motif that is only slightly correct, technology-wise, and mostly useless and illogical, also technology-wise. Of course, at the end of the day, one goes to the watch a \"Mission Impossible\" film not for its plot but for its actions and for the appearance of an ever running, ever heroic Ethan Hunt. In that aspect, this film is just a perfect choice with non-stop action sequences throughout the film until the very end in exotic and beautiful locations. To sum it up, this is indeed an excellent action film for this Summer, but could not be a new benchmark for the action genre as someone might hope after knowing its ridiculously high Rotten Tomatoes score.",

Experienced actors like Sean Harris, Ving Rhames, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin show even more diversity in these roles here, with Harris being a favorite of mine playing the intimidating, endlessly evil Solomon Lane, but every other actor is also very good, adding more humanizing qualities to their characters (Tom Cruise and Ferguson do an especially good job here). Although Lane is as wicked as ever, the other villain \"Lark\", whose real identity you probably won't be shocked to see, manages to be a surprisingly sympathetic villain when you truly understand his motives, you might even agree with him somewhat.

It had several really good action scenes - overall the action was really good.  But the plot and story of this one - it was too complicated, it was not compelling.  I knew from the (spoiler) start, when there wasn't a good opening sequence, that something was off.  The opening sequence was slow and was just setting up the story.  Also, the cast felt a little tired because the story was lacking.  Rebecca Ferguson was used to great effect in the last MI installment.  This story tried to use her in the same way but it was not as interesting, repetitive.  Simon Pegg is excellent in everything he does, but he and Ving Rhames are becoming sort of flat characters in the franchise. I think new supporting characters would be more interesting.  Henry Cavill was a great casting choice and he was decent character but the story wasn't up to par for his character.

            "content": "The vast majority of movie franchises suffer from diminishing returns. This Tom Cruise-led action series has avoided that common downturn by turning in ridiculously ambitious, consistently fresh and eminently exhilarating thrill rides. The sixth M:I entry, Fallout also boasts some firsts: first time a director has returned, first time the story has been directly influenced by the previous instalment, and first time a femme fatale has come back to seduce/endanger our protagonist. A big part of the franchise's success has been the revolving door of directors at the helm, each bringing their own visual style and filmmaking priorities, so it's interesting to see how Christopher McQuarrie attacks his second impossible mission behind the camera. Not surprisingly, seeing as McQuarrie has always been a more blunt-force kind of action filmmaker, this sequel is arguably the most bruising and intense. Which is no small feat for a series that has prided itself on its physical demanding set pieces. There are no less than four sequences that are genuinely jaw-dropping in their execution, featuring crunching hand-to-hand combat, an invigorating car/motorbike pursuit, an adrenaline-pumping roof-top chase on foot, and a ballsy helicopters-playing-chicken sequence beginning with an unbelievable stunt. Love him or hate him offscreen, it's getting harder to argue that Cruise isn't one of the finest showmen working in Hollywood today. His dedication to performing some of the craziest stunts committed to celluloid is admirable and, quite simply, amazing considering his age. But it wouldn't be the hugely entertaining film it is if everyone wasn't firing on all cylinders; from the pitch-perfect supporting cast (Simon Pegg's comedic sidekick, Rebecca Ferguson's MI6 agent, Henry Cavill's undiplomatic CIA henchman) to the behind the scenes crew. In fact composer Lorne Balfe deserves special mention for his left-of-field score, the use of low, haunting orchestral tunes (including a fantastic rendition of the classic M:I theme) during select sequences is a masterstroke in imbuing the movie with a certain gravitas. With everyone at the top of their game, headlined by another fervent Cruise performance, Fallout is extremely high-calibre action cinema that will feature predominantly on end-of-year 'best' lists.",

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) along with some familiar allies (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan) in a race against time after a mission gone wrong. Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, and Vanessa Kirby also join the dynamic cast with filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie returning to the helm.\n\nI really loved Mission: Impossible - Fallout, I missed these breathtaking action scenes this year, but finally, I found what I've been looking for for very so long, and thanks goes to Mission: Impossible - Fallout.\n\nEverything in this movie was completely amazing, except for a small leak.. and it is the script... As I said it's not big, it's just a bothering sentence is repeating every plan..\n\nLet's get started with the only thing I didn't like about this movie, and as I said it's the script. Okay, why every thing they are about to do, or planned to do, or anything to do, they just have to say \"I'll figure it out\" or \"I'm working on it\"? What? Didn't you plan for anything for this movie or something?\nThese two sentences bothered the hell out of me, actually! But it's nothing compared to everything that I loved in this movie.\n\nFirst of all, the action sequence, it's one of the best action movie of all the time! Every action scene I was like \"OMG, thank you for giving me a masterpiece in action, thank you!\". I think it's the best action movie in 2018 so far.\n\nQuickly quickly.. let's move to the performances... I loved them all! What an act-convincing?! I have no other comment about the acting, cause it was quite perfect!\n\nOh, we're not done yet, we still have the fascinating storytelling! I don't want to spoil anything, but I need to say that don't believe what you're watching, cause they will surprise you like hell!!!!\nThe story was good in every way that it could be, maybe at the beginning it didn't get my attention, but then it got my whole attention!\n\nBelieve me, no one is overreacting when he says that this movie is a masterpiece, and if you don't believe us, go and see it yourself. It will not let you down, never ever!\n\nI actually wasn't excited to watch this movie, the trailer didn't get me at all, but it did actually give me what I want, it was way better than I expected it's gonna be!\n\nOh, one more sadly thing I just remembered that I didn't like, the OST wasn't that good as it was so usual. But it wasn't so bad!\n\nI'm gonna give Mission: Impossible - Fallout an A, I think it's a magnificent movie, and definitely a worth-watching movie, I highly recommend watching this movie, guys.\n\nOkay, guys, thank you as always for reading my review, hope you like, and if you have any comment, please, say it to get improved.",

A lot of twists and turns as you would come to expect for IM films. \nMI: Fallout feels like Christopher Nolan film. Christopher Macquarie does an amazing job at replicating Nolan's style, there are points in this movie where you would be surprised that you aren't watching a Chris Nolan film.\n\nMI feels pretty old-fashioned. Lots of practical effects and sparing usage of CGI. The score also feels old-fashioned and gives us probably the best use of the mission impossible theme ever. \nMission Impossible: Fallout utilizes many locations around the world. It makes great use of its locations, all of which have a unique job in the story and unique set pieces.\n\nAnd these locations are astoundingly shown in IMAX cinematography. This is a MUST SEE in IMAX. This movie is made to be seen in IMAX. If you can't make it to an IMAX get to the biggest screen you can. The best experience for this film is in IMAX.\n\nTom Cruise' dedication to realism set this movie (and all the mission impossible movies) miles apart from other action films. Tom Cruise learnt to fly a helicopter in six weeks for this film, and not only did he had to fly the helicopter, but he also had to act and even operate the cameras as nobody else could be seen in the helicopter. Tom Cruise looked oddly older than any of his films. But this allowed for a more mature performance from Cruise. \nHenry Cavill is amazing. I believe that this is the best role to date. Though the film, unfortunately, doesn't utilize him to his fullest. \nSimon Pegg feels more like a real Hollywood actor than he had before. He was more in control of his character and in the other films he had an \"OMG I can believe I'm this movie\" feel to his performance which he seemed to have lost in this film. Which is great.\n\nYou may want to watch the previous film is you haven't already as there are lots of links to rogue nation, other than that you don't really need to have seen the other films.",

Ethan Hunt's ego is too big and they over do the whole \"he's clearly the best guy on earth wow so wholesome so good so moral.\" The bad guy could not have been more obvious since they give it away wayyyyy too early in the movie. The white widow acted clueless, dumb, and was overall just another pretty face to look at. Every action scene was beautifully choreographed and wonderfully filmed but was so impractical and littered with so many glaring flaws it took away from how cool it was supposed to be.

            "content": "As an avid fan of the Mission Impossible movies I was a bit concerned about Fallout, because there are two great things that set this franchise apart from all the others, and they ignored both this time. First of all, they have done a good job of hiring a different director for every single film, which means they each have their own unique feel. This movie was carrying over Christopher McQuarrie to take a second consecutive shot at directing. I didn\u2019t have any issues with his direction of Rogue Nation, but I liked the variety they attained before. Secondly, all the films up to this point have been almost complete stand-alone stories. There were a few minor references to the past, but nothing that made it necessary to know the history to enjoy the next movie. Fallout is the first that directly ties into the previous films and references them a number of times. In fact, you could almost find direct connections to all 5 previous installments in this one. I\u2019m not sure if any of this made it hard for those who aren\u2019t fans of the franchise to follow this plot, but I found myself lapping it up. It felt stand-alone, but also connected, which is hard to pull off. At this point it seems like they need to reference the history anyways, because Tom Cruise is starting to get older, despite how it may appear on screen. This is the first time I felt they played into Cruise\u2019s age just a little bit. He actually looks worn, weary, and fallible at certain times. This doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t kicking butt and performing some of the most insane death-defying stunts you can imagine, because there\u2019s still plenty of that. The stunt coordinators on these films continue to astound me, as they make the action feel authentic instead of something manufactured in a machine. The bar is continually set by practical stunts, and computer animation still hasn\u2019t caught up. That\u2019s what makes Mission Impossible the gold standard when it comes to action. The story here is a little convoluted, but considering the amount of double-crossing and mistaken identity that happens in these films it is par for the course. I did find myself predicting some of the twists and turns only because I\u2019ve trained myself to expect some level of deception at any moment. The way they build tension into the story is perfect, and even when I mentally know the hero can\u2019t possibly die in an early scene, I still feel some level of concern that the movie might surprise me. The cast is all great in Fallout, including the newcomer Henry Cavill. I\u2019m such an avid fan of this franchise that I wish they would start grooming the next generation star who has an insane taste for risking his/her life to replace Tom Cruise. We\u2019ll see if it ever gets to that point, but for now, I\u2019m still enjoying the adventures, and I\u2019m astounded that at this point it seems Mission Impossible has found a way to completely steal the spy film spotlight from James Bond.",

Tom Cruise once again impresses fans across the globe, by doing every stunt by himself without the help of a 'stunt double'. Other cast members such as Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris and Alec Baldwin are very good at playing their roles aswell. For me personally, I find this film the absolute best of the famous M:I collection. The action never slows down, and speaking of action - that bathroom fight scene was epic in so many ways. Props to the director/whoever helped to make Fallout, because I have now declared it to be my favourite movie of 2018 (so far) with Avengers: Infinity War being second.

Tom Cruise is simply on another level with work ethic that you do not see anymore. He learned to fly a freaking helicopter for a chase sequence, he jumped out of a plane at 25000 feet, and also broke his ankle performing a jump. He is nuts! The film if you follow the series picks up as a continuation of the 5th film as most of the characters return with the exception of Renner. The plot was deep felt no matter how silly some of the sequences got. We really see some tight relationships on the screen that does had some heart to the film. The film never ever let up, and had sequences that rank up there with the dubai scene. I also want to say Henry Cavill exceeded expectations here. He was fantastic and very believable. He also kicked major tail. This movie is the ULTIMATE popcorn fun with an edge to it. Its what Michael Bay wishes he could be. At the end of the day Cruise is what ties the film together. His bold presence, his stunt work and dedication to the role puts the bow on the box. A near perfect action film that could be one of the genres best in some time.",

            "content": "'Mission Impossible: Fallout' is directed by Christopher McQuarrie who previously directed 'Rogue Nation.' This is the first instalment of the franchise in which a director has returned, and it has proved to be an excellent decision.  McQuarrie has taken everything that has worked within the series, as he did in 'Rogue Nation,' and escalated it. The stunning action set pieces the series has become known for are combined with refined emotional stakes in 'Fallout.' McQuarrie is clearly aware that intense action is not intense without the audience being emotionally invested in the characters. \n\nThe stakes in 'Fallout' are ridiculously high involving a nuclear threat, which we as audience members have become accustomed to, yet McQuarrie keeps the story rooted within character, bringing the film above other generic action films with 'end of the world' scenarios. Sean Harris's brilliantly menacing 'Solomon Lane' makes the threat personal to Tom Cruise's 'Ethan Hunt.' This personal element is escalated with the return of Michelle Monaghan reprising her role from J.J. Abrams's 'Mission Impossible: 3' who is at the heart of the story from the very opening shot. McQuarrie has created the most emotionally intense film of the series by developing its characters before placing them within the action. Rebecca Ferguson, returning as 'Isla Faust' from 'Rogue Nation' is given a rivetingly unpredictable role. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames also reprise their roles. Although underused, Rhames has a surprisingly emotional dialogue scene, increasing the tension in proceeding action scenes involving his character. The film is set up unpredictably in a way which means you actually feel the characters are at real risk. And of course, Tom Cruise gives a fittingly vulnerable, strong performance as Ethan Hunt especially in scenes involving Monaghan's character and in interactions with Sean Harris as 'Lane' and of course within the thrilling action sequences he is at the centre of.\n\nThe jaw-dropping action sequences are made jaw-dropping due to their practicality. Cruise has shockingly topped the C-17 stunt in 'Rogue Nation' with a terrifyingly brilliant helicopter sequence filmed using IMAX cameras, performed for real in typical Tom Cruise fashion. The Paris motorcycle sequence is so intense it is difficult to watch, yet you won't be able to take your eyes of the screen. What makes these action scenes is that the stunts are combined with perfect camerawork. McQuarrie is not attempting to imitate the fitting shakiness of 'Bourne' as J.J. Abrams tried unsuccessfully in 'Mission Impossible: 3.' He is doing the opposite. The camera is placed within the action and showcases the stunts in all their glory, following objects/characters or even being attached to them. There is a stand-out action sequence in a bathroom which is far more grounded than larger scaled stunts within the film, yet it is made just as intense, maybe more so, through stunning choreography and the casting of 'Liang Yang.' His menacing facial expressions alone elevate the intensity of the sequence. Unusual for hand-to-hand combat film sequences, you feel the impacts of every punch. This feeling of impact is obviously brought out through the choreography, but is also heightened with sound design. Every punch is brutally heard. Every gunshot is joltingly loud. In contrast, McQuarrie has also used silence in moments of action, most notably as a result of a lightning strike during the nail-biting H.A.L.O jump sequence, and in a brilliant one-take shootout sequence in order to give it the surreal feeling it required. \n\nFurthermore, there are quieter scenes of tension throughout created by performances and writing. The writing is often predictable, and is no 'Usual Suspects,' also written by Christopher McQuarrie, yet it is often very good in terms of creating tension. A scene which stood out for me was one involving a French policewoman for its tension. Humour is also cleverly balanced with tension and darkness, especially evident in this scene - a scene of initial humour which unfolds into extreme tension and weightiness. \n\nIn conclusion, 'Fallout' is the best entry in the series yet with its culmination of incredible stunt work, performances and a personal story to the characters which serves to heighten the intensity.",

As the release date looms the anticipation builds up to the point where it's too high to ever be met, and you can't help but be a tiny bit disappointed when finally viewing it. It takes some time pondering and a good step back to see it's full beauty. For me in the last few years only two highly anticipated films have not fallen victim to this phenomenon, impressing from the opening credits to the end credits pulverising expectations and snatching breath away before one can gasp. The first was Blade Runner 2049 and the second is Mission: Impossible Fallout. \n\nNever has a modern action film (let alone a sequel in an inconsistent franchise) confounded my expectations and defied the limits of what an action film can achieve. It's incredible, thrilling, chilling and gorgeous to look at. From the shadowy and clandestine opening that recalls the cold-war shadowplay of the original. The slick extended shots of action sequences and dialogue and stunning action beats to quieter moments where we get to pause for a half breath and soak in the beauty of the many locations they shot in to the final much lauded helicopter sequence. This is a movie that just keeps on giving. From Halo jumps to bruising fist fights to bike chases, car chases, foot chases shoot outs and finally dangling below a helicopter before climbing up inside it (for real too) to chase a second helicopter through snow capped mountain ranges (New Zealand doubling as Kashmir) and that's just the action! \n\nIt also contains some of the most layered characterisation of any M:I film a coherent plot and chilling villian(s). Not to mention the female representation. M:I has Ironically managed to do over the last 4 films what Bond has not been able to do over 24 films. Create strong, independent woman with their own motivations and convictions capable and self reliant for the most part while still managing to knock 'em dead in a evening gown when required. They threaten to steal the show as does Henry Cavill in his hulking intimidating and unstoppable yet still charming form. It manages to pay homage to the best parts of the previous entires even better than Rogue Nation did and land the 3rd act better than Rogue Nation did too while loosing the \"cutesy\" tone of the previous two for a grittier more grounded approach with real stakes this time. Reverting to 35mm as a shooting format is also a welcome return, rendering a beautifully filmic image that appears natural yet embellishing in all the right places. \n\nI struggled to like Rogue Nation as much as I wanted to. The tone was something I couldn't reconcile and the action wasn't as Polished and well staged as I'd hoped and the film lost its motivation somewhere after the final bike chase. Fallout rectifies this and then some. It's not only the best M:I to date it's potentially the best action blockbuster ever -and that's saying something. The real Impossible Mission (should they choose to accept -(sorry)) will be topping this with the next entry. Good luck though. Highest recommendation.",

            "content": "Coming down from the surging adrenaline rush, I was trying to determine when was the last time an action movie made me feel the immersive, delirious highs that Mission: Impossible - Fallout offers in spades, and what I came up with 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road. Simply put, this is the best straightforward action movie in three years. It's the best Mission: Impossible movie in the series, which, if it hadn't already, has assumed the peak position of the most consistent, most entertaining, and best action franchise in Hollywood. Allow me to explain how returning writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) makes an action movie that demolishes the competition.\n\nEthan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been pulled back into spy action thanks to the lingering fallout (eh, eh?) of the capture of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), whose followers, nicknamed The Apostles, have stolen three plutonium cores. It's Ethan Hunt's fault the nuclear cores got loose, and so he and his team, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), must clean up after their mess. The CIA sends its own asset, the burly August Walker (Henry Cavill), to help oversee the mission and specifically Ethan Hunt, who must pose as a shadowy terrorist broker to maintain appearances with important figures in the criminal underworld. In order to get the nuclear parts, Ethan Hunt has to retrieve Solomon Lane and release him back into the open. Complicating matters further is Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who needs Solomon dead to clear her own spy debts.\n\nEvery action movie lives or dies depending upon its unique set pieces, often the first thing constructed by a studio and then the plot mechanics are ladled on merely as the barest of connecting tissue. They need to have stakes, they need to have purpose, they need to be memorable, and they need to be understood and develop organically. Mission: Impossible - Fallout could be taught in filmmaking schools about how to properly build action set pieces. They are brilliant. McQuarrie finds interesting ways to set them up, complicate them, and just keep the escalation going in a manner that still maintains the believability of the moment. Take for instance a foot chase where Ethan Hunt is trying to nab a bad guy through downtown London. Where McQuarrie pushes into the extraordinary is by having that foot chase on a multi-level terrain. Ethan Hunt has to chase after his target but multiple stories above the ground, and so he's leaping out windows, jumping over rooftops simply to keep up. It's a simple twist that takes what we're familiar with and, literally, elevates it to new heights. Or take for instance the mission in Paris to capture Solomon Lane. At first it's capture, then it's flee police, then it's flee another assassin. There are multiple stages to this sequence, each with a new goal, each with new complications, and each with new eye-popping stunts and escapes. The action finds natural points to progress, making smart use of the geography, and keeping different elements at play to come in and out to add more problems. This is how you do action right. As soon as the half-hour mark settles in with the arrival of Walker, the movie is practically nonstop in its set pieces until the very end. At a steep 147 minutes, this is the longest Mission: Impossible movie yet but it's breathless in its execution.\n\nAmazing set pieces that are cleverly designed is one aspect of a great action movie, but if you can't tell what's going on, what's the point of all that cleverness? Fortunately, McQuarrie understands this and adheres to a visceral depiction of the action that creates gloriously immersive and pulse-pounding sequences. The set pieces are terrific, so it stands to reason the stuntwork should be terrific, and to make sure you appreciate the stuntwork, McQuarrie makes sure the photography highlights the verisimilitude. It's a symbiotic (or as the Venom trailer tells me, \"sym-BI-oat-ic\") relationship but when done correctly, as evidenced in this film, it's the key to truly kinetic action sequences. Take for instance a parachute jump that marks the start of the second act. McQuarrie films it as a sustained long take, and as the camera plummets to the ground chasing after the two men, our brains can tell us that there is some special effects trickery to mitigate the dangers, but our senses are overwhelmed with the sustained illusion of tension. The fight choreography is equally up to the challenge. A bathroom brawl with Ethan Hunt and Walker and another man becomes a lesson in how many things can be smashed and what can be used as a weapon. A high-speed motorcycle chase through Parisian streets gets even more frantic when Ethan Hunt drives against traffic, and the scene becomes even more exciting when McQuarrie's lens allows us to see the danger in all its glory.\n\nThe Mission: Impossible franchise has been notable for its insane stuntwork but also, chiefly after the second installment, its edict to practical effects and maintaining the believability of its reality. It's still movie spy shenanigans and globetrotting adventures, yes, but the moment-to-moment thrills feel like they're really happening. The Fast and Furious franchise has gained great acclaim for the bombast of its physics-defying spectacle, and the Mission: Impossible franchise seems to have gone purposely in the opposite direction. It's real Tom Cruise jumping off that building, it's real Tom Cruise riding through traffic on a motorcycle, and it's real Tom Cruise falling and climbing up a speeding helicopter during the thrilling finale. Cruise has had a death wish when it comes to throwing himself into the high-wire stunts of his franchise, but even at 56 years old he's still at it, essentially trying to commit suicide on film for all of our amusement. Cruise is one of the few remaining movie stars and his commitment is without question.\n\nThis is also the first Mission: Impossible film that feels like the characters matter. It's a direct continuation from the previous film, 2015's Rogue Nation, bringing back the (somewhat lackluster) villain, the newest spy counterpart/potential love interest, the CIA and IMF brass, and the essential supporting team members from prior engagements. Because of this it feels more like what happened previously was establishment for a new story building upon that foundation. Rather than starting all over, the characters find ways to deepen their relationships, and the film opens up Ethan Hunt as a character and the toll his duty takes on those closest to him. There are some nice quiet moments that examine these characters as actual people. Several complications are as a direct result of personal character decisions, some good and some bad. I was joking with my pal Ben Bailey beforehand about wondering whether they'd find a way for Ving Rhames to matter, since he hasn't been much more than \"a guy in the van\" for four movies, and by God they make him matter. They make each team member matter, finding moments to give them, mini-goals they're entrusted with. During the dizzying helicopter chase in the finale, supporting players are left with their own task. Luther has to defuse a bomb but doesn't have enough hands. Benji has to find something valuable in a very needle-haystack situation designed to torment and waste precious time. Ilsa is at cross-purposes for most of the film, not wanting to harm her fellow allies but also being given her own orders to prove her loyalty and protect her future. All of this comes to a head and it makes the parts feel as important as the whole. That's great storytelling.\n\nLet's talk about that million-dollar mustache of Cavill's. It was a year ago that Justice League re-shoots required Cavill and the Mission: Impossible team refused to allow their actor to shave his mustache, thus leading to that unsettling fake baby lip Superman was sporting in a majority of his scenes in the haphazard Justice League film. I just read an AV Club interview with McQuarrie where he for the first time discusses the whole mustache brouhaha and apparently Paramount estimated that it would have cost them three million for the effects to uphold Cavill's upper lip continuity. Warner Brothers refused to pay up and so went down that ill-fated CGI mustache-removing route. It was shortly afterwards that Cruise shattered his ankle in a roof-leaping stunt (that is in the finished film and advertisements) and the production had to shut down for a month. If only Warner Brothers had waited, perhaps we all could have avoided this mustache mess.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout is a new highpoint for the best action franchise going in movies today (I'm still waiting for a third Raid film, Gareth Evans). The set pieces are memorable and unique, leading from one into the next with exquisite precision and thought. The action sequences are stunning and shot with stunning photography, highlighting the stunning stuntwork by the best death-defying professionals. It's the first Mission: Impossible movie that doesn't climax at its middle; in fact there's a pretty obvious reveal that feels like it was going to be a late Act Three twist, but McQuarrie recognizes the audience thinking ahead, and there's like a whole other exciting 45 minutes after. The stakes are better felt because the characters matter and are integrated in meaningful ways. This is the most I've enjoyed Henry Cavill in a movie (with possible exception of another spy movie, Man From U.N.C.L.E.), and you know what, his mustache works too. While the vertigo-inducing Burj Khalifa sequence is the best set piece in the franchise, Fallout has everything else beat at every level. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a reminder that there are few things in the world of cinema better than a properly orchestrated, properly filmed, and properly developed action movie operating at full throttle. This is one of the reasons why we go to the movies, folks. See it in IMAX if possible. Soak it up.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

I was pumped for the most part of the film which had really memorable and outstanding action sequences that blew me away. I can see alot of the film really tried hard with the stuntwork and it was amazingly well brought. the story is alright but it doesn't deliver anything new to the franchise and is something we've seen for a while. The cast however is really great like Simon Pegg who plays Benji, Vin Rhames as Luther and everyone does a pretty outstanding job in their acting especially Henry Cavill who plays August Walker without that CGI moustache lol and I though he was great though he kind of l from his character a little but was great as the villain as seen in the trailers. From Start to finish, Mission Impossible: Fallout does whatever it can to be perfect and it is, really top notch stuntwork, performances were great, loved the cast, action sequences were breathtaking, and I totally would recommend especially in the IMAX format though sadly only 2 scenes were shot with it but still, definitely a thrill ride.",

It was too long and incredibly slow in parts, to the point where I lost interest on a number of occasions. The acting from some of the support characters was weak and wooden, and the screenplay could have been much stronger. Many of the action scenes (chases, running, etc) were repetitive, and I felt like there was very little new material here. Compared to previous films, there wasn't the same level of complexity and plot twists that we are used to. Yes the cinematography is good the film finally found some dramatic tension towards the end, but that was too little too late. For me, this is the weakest of the MI films to date. MC",

Plot armoured to the tips of his spikes hair, Cruise and his buddies defuse the excitement, as their is no danger of death. All of the huffing and puffing around the absurd, turbo fuelled action count for naught in this Tom and Jerry cartoon. It is worse than a 1970's Jame Bond with the raging Roger Moore. Sure its fun, great eye candy.  But it is too easy for Hunt to work out how to win.'I'll figure it out' he responds to every absurd situation. And of course he does. He read the script. He knows he will win.\n\nYes it is enjoyable despite all the silliness. You can't keep your eyes off of it. Simon Pegg and Ving Rames are again along for the ride, and Cruise uses the same writer/director. It's Tom's film, all the way - everyone else is a prop to his human Superman, and the dialogue reflects his centrality, especially in the last, cloying scenes.

            "content": "It is staggering to see that these Mission: Impossible flicks actually seem to keep getting better. On the surface, this sixth entry in its high-octane, fast-paced, yet patiently-conceived, thrill-fest of a franchise is a rocket launcher with enough firepower to skyrocket any action junkie into divine explosive sensations of adrenalized intoxication. However, this astronomical energy is further complimented by a rich dosage of both character value and transparency. This movie manages, in an admirable fashion, to project the weight of the struggles, emotions, decisions, and consequences of its characters in a manner that feels genuinely substantial and even palpable to the audience -- a very rare feat to such extent in an action blockbuster. Here, the filmmakers want these characters to be understood as people instead of just being applauded for looking cool, and the distinct effectiveness of these efforts is solidified through three main aspects: 1) the ultimate threat against humanity in the film, the sheer scope of destruction and terror infused in it, is heavily based in reality to where the uprising of a similar danger in our modern society is entirely believable; 2) the characters are individually and cohesively motivated to save people simply for the sakes of humanity and their loved ones rather than be coerced by a stereotypical call-to-arms scenario (revenge, rescuing the damsel in distress, etc.); and 3) the movie quickly and clearly establishes that failure is a definite possibility, presenting a whole new, fully-loaded tension tablet for the audience to swallow. In short, the movie honorably convinces its audience that there are deeper reasons to care for these characters and the outcomes of their missions......which is more than can be said for most movies of a similar caliber. Movies like this are noteworthy and prove that action blockbusters can be much more than fluffy, explosive, popcorn, summer money-makers.",

The stunts he performs are astounding, he continues to do ridiculous things for our entertainment. Cruise knows his character like the back of his hand, he plays the IMF agent so effortlessly; there simply isn't anyone else better to be the star of your movie in this blockbuster-driven world. The rest of the cast is also awesome with many returning names such as Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, Rebecca Ferguson, and Sean Harris as the infamous Solomon Lane. Meanwhile new names Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett slide in perfectly to the franchise. \nThere are so many positive things to say about this movie. The plot kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, I could never predict what would happen next, I never knew who to trust; there were always twists and turns around the corner. The set-pieces are as crazy and thrilling as ever, this movie is action at its finest. Want a great fight scene? Or what about a shootout? Or a car chase? Or even better, a helicopter chase? In every aspect this movie delivers. The villains are strong and can hold their own; Solomon Lane, while in a more reserved role, is still as menacing as ever. While the \"stop the nuclear weapons from going off\" plot isn't wholly original, the movie is able to keep it fresh through adding its own sophistication and nuance to it. I really liked Ghost Protocol, so I have trouble saying this is the best of the franchise, but regardless, this is a great action movie. \nYour mission, if you choose to accept it, is to make sure you see this movie in theaters because I know I may have to see this one a second time it was so awesome.",

So my recommendation is to show up to this movie an hour late then you'll get an all around fun action movie experience.

            "content": "July 27, 2018\n\nBenji: \"How close were we?\"\n\nEthan: \"The usual.\"\n\nBenji: \"Huh. The usual.\"\n\nThis isn't just the second to last dialogue exchange in \"Mission: Impossible: Fallout\"; it's also a summary of the preceding two and a half hours. If ever there was a typical \"Mission: Impossible\" movie-the template of which was forged nearly a quarter century ago-this is it. \"Fallout,\" much like \"Rogue Nation\" before it, seems determined to stay completely inside the lines set and maintained by its fellow \"Mission\" brethren, as well as other spy-action movies. In fact, of \"Rogue Nation,\" I had written: \"...the movie left me feeling cautious and uncertain about future 'M:I' installments...Cruise and the filmmakers seem willing to water down and re-use the plots on which the action and stunts hang. I'm not sure how long this approach can go on.\" Unfortunately, \"Fallout\" confirms to me it cannot go on any longer, or at least it shouldn't (I'm sure the movie will still be a huge financial success), and it's the first \"Mission\" movie I can't justifiably recommend.\n\nIt tears me up inside to write such words, because as a series of technical exercises and highly elaborate stunt sequences, \"Fallout\" is stupendous and exceptional, and often the best of its kind. On paper, its ambitions as a spy thriller, at least as far as spectacle, should have yielded quite the mesmerizing movie-going experience. But oddly enough, as a movie doesn't feel experiential. It plays as more of a model that future second unit directors, stunt coordinators, and editors might study in order learn how to seamlessly execute action sequences of the highest caliber and complexity. From an academic point of view, I would recommend it hands down, but from a narrative one, I needed more than just the standard \"Mission\" plot to engage me.\n\nSpeaking of the plot, if the film's closing dialogue summed it up as \"the usual,\" then the opening scene, in not so explicit of words, essentially promises the same thing. During the trademark, \"This is your mission, should you choose to accept it\" encrypted recording, spy/agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) receives word that members of the terrorist organization known as the Syndicate, led by the now-captured but still very dangerous Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) and which Hunt sought to prove the existence of in \"Rogue Nation,\" have recently resurfaced and formed a new faction called The Apostles. They are partnering with a faceless zealot named John Lark, who has written a manifesto that outlines a fanatical plan to wipe the Earth clean of corruption and sin in order to begin it anew. It's your typical megalomaniacal scheme, which will begin with Lark contaminating enough of the world's water supply to eliminate one-third of the planet's population.\n\nTo carry out this annihilation, Lark has tasked the Apostles with acquiring three plutonium cores, which he'll use to make a nuclear bomb that will detonate atop the mountains surrounding Pakistan, India and China. That is, unless Hunt and his trusted Impossible Mission Force (IMF) team-Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg)-can intercept the cores first. And indeed they have the chance, but during a tense exchange at the beginning of the film, Hunt must choose between obtaining the cores and saving a member of his own team's life, and in the end, his teammate wins out, leaving the cores, as they say, \"in the wind.\"\n\nSo what was once a seemingly straightforward mission becomes, yet again, a most complicated operation that takes Hunt and his cohorts all over the world, from Belfast to Paris to London, and eventually Kashmir, as they attempt to retrieve the plutonium and prevent three nuclear bombs from going off. And if you think things won't boil down to the last possible millisecond, complete with a red digital readout, then you're obviously not familiar with \"the usual\" \"Mission\" devices.\n\nUsual or not, one of the elements that has always kept the \"Mission\" movies grounded is the humanity and likability of the characters, and both of those are in full swing here, despite the absurdity of the plot. In fact, it's Hunt's decision to spare one human life at the potential cost of millions that IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin, now so hard to imagine not as Donald Trump) finds so admirable about him. The same cannot be said of CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett), who doesn't trust the IMF and insists her own agent, Augustus Walker (Henry Cavill), accompany Hunt when he must parachute from high above Paris to meet the mysterious White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) at the Grand Palais. She's supposedly the broker between John Lark and the Apostles, but one of the running themes throughout the \"M:I\" movies is that, aside from the good guys, nobody really is who they say are. The reveal of each character's actual identity and loyalty is so common a ploy in this series that it's fairly easy to guess who will come out either as a savior or as a double-crosser, and the fact that it is so easy now dilutes some of the fun.\n\nStill, the movie does have a consistent momentum, and to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie's credit (he's the only filmmaker to helm two \"Mission\" movies following \"Rogue Nation\"), he doesn't dumb things down, and the standard labyrinthine plot set by the original \"Mission\" continues here. But again, because such a quality has become so routine, it simply doesn't render the same effect it once did. Because we anticipate the narrative being overstuffed and convoluted, \"Fallout\" merely meets our expectations instead of going beyond them. \n\nThe same goes for the otherwise incredible stunts and action sequences, which range from the aforementioned skydive; an intense martial arts fight in a night club men's room; a motorcycle/car chase on the narrow streets of Paris; a full-throttle run across the rooftops of London; and a superior dual helicopter battle over snow-capped mountains. Each of these is executed with great vigor, detail, and conviction, and had they been the first of their kind, \"Mission: Impossible: Fallout\" might have been one of the most memorable action movies in recent memory. However, as extreme, sensational and uncompromising as these sequences are, the fact remains they are not original, but simply performed to a greater degree than what we've seen before. The movie essentially takes what other action movies (including previous \"M:I\" movies) have done and pumped them full of steroids, and I needed it do more than just beef things up.\n\nTo give you an idea, the bathroom fight, right down to the lighting design, feels like it was yanked right out of \"True Lies,\" while the Paris chase mirrors a similar sequence in \"The Bourne Identity.\" Meanwhile, as Hunt sprints across a series of roofs in London, I couldn't help but recall him sprinting at the end of \"M:I:III\" in much the same way.\n\nSo unfortunately, the film's \"usualness\" (both with regard to its plot and its action), ends up costing it too much excitement value. Don't get me wrong-I fully recognize the filmmakers' technical prowess, as well as Cruise and company's ceaseless and enthusiastic dedication, but the hackneyed material ultimately undermines them and I left the theater feeling mostly underwhelmed.\n\nStill, even though \"Fallout\" didn't marvel me like I hoped, it did leave me hopeful, because I'm confident this same team of filmmakers and actors can apply their energy and resources to fresher, more worthy material. This should be their mission going forward, so let's hope they choose to accept it.",

            "content": "As most people out there already know, I love my movies and am always champing at the bit to check out the latest blockbuster.\n\nTonight was no exception, as we cruised in to the ACE Cinemas to view the latest instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise.\n\nThis version was like a multi-faceted diamond where each facet shined boldly beyond belief.\n\nThe first aspect that was worthy of mention was the return the very cool cast, in Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg playing the parts of legendary Ethan Hunt, Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn.\n\nAlso returning was the potential love interest for Ethan in Rebecca Ferguson as Lisa.\n\nThe producers also enlisted the services of the latest screen Superman, Henry Cavill. He did a great job in adding some machismo manliness so as to try and rival Ethan's alpha dominance.\n\nAlec Baldwin is always a welcomed addition to any cast and was convincing as Ethan's boss, albeit in somewhat of a cameo appearance.\n\nThe second facet that shone was the plot. Which this time around involved a terrorist by the name of Solomon Lane, who with a bunch of his so-called 'Apostles', was trying to acquire enough Plutonium to create a nuclear catastrophe that would bring civilisation to its knees. His philosophy was that \"peace on Earth cannot truly be achieved without great suffering first\"! There were the usual twists and turns we've come to expect in MI flicks as well as the par for the course backstabbing, double-crossing and even triple-crossing that spy stories seem to thrive on. The only problem with this is that in the past the MI stories have been somewhat confusing and with that a tad frustrating. The confusion on this occasion was there, but thankfully nowhere near as bad.\n\nThe third facet of these movies that never fails to disappoint is the intense action that has you on the edge of your seat from go to woe. And with that, I take my hat off to fifty-something year old Sir Thomas Cruise, for defying father-time with more of his amazing stunts and cleverly coordinated fight scenes. Whatever his Endocrinologist has prescribed for him, I want me some of that!!!\n\nThe frantic facet of this film which was fantastic were the superb chase scenes that involved motorbikes, cars, trucks, helicopters and of course that inimitable running technique of Tom's, where you swear he's going to do himself an injury with the way those pointed fingers go perilously close to his eye sockets as his arms go up and down like human pistons!!\n\nAs a fan of BMW automobiles, it was also nice to see them clearly sponsoring Mission Impossible with some of their magnificent M-Series vehicles, R nine T Scrambler motorcycles and my favourite, the classic 750iL Saloon!!\n\nThe fifth facet that for me was the most fascinating was the way the cinematographers masterfully used the art of filming iconic buildings, cultural structures, unique camera angles and majestic landscapes from around the world to enhance the whole viewing experience. This artistry was not something you would normally expect in an action blockbuster, but it was so craftily embedded that it kind of snuck up on you as the film progressed. By the end you realised that, not only were you fatigued from the all the suspense and action, but you were simultaneously super-impressed by the sheer visual splendour!\n\nThe final facet that cannot be understated is the marvellous music that we've all loved since the iconic TV series started back in the late 1960's.

You thought scaling the Burj Al Khalifa, Infiltrating the Kremlin and CIA, and generally kicking arse on every continent in the previous MI`s wasn't enough? You`d be right, wouldn't you? Sure, when you step into the cinema to see the latest MI you`re not expecting Tarantino`s intricate dialogue, nor Nolan`s cinematic artistry. You come expecting Tom Cruise doing what he does best: explosions, double crosses, car chases, iconic villains and a myriad of exotic locations, not forgetting those bloody masks!. And it delivers on all of these, especially the masks! So ver many masks.. And yet, and yet I feel they really dropped the ball on this one. The sheer preposterousness of it all. Case in point: Ethan and Henry Cavill have to get to Paris to stop a meeting between two people (don't ask who the people are I still don't have a clue!). Instead of buying them a couple of Easyjet tickets from London and a taxi from De Gaulle, the CIA or IMF or is it MI6? Decide to parachute them in from 25000 feet, if that wasn't bad enough they neglected to check the weather forecast as there was a lighting storm going on to add to the `drama`.\nThis ridiculous formula continues throughout the film, as Hunt constantly neglects to do the obvious logical things in order to achieve his `objectives`. This comes to its apex at the climax of the film as Hunt squares off against the baddies number one henchman, its mano e mano, Hunt needs to get the special device the henchman has! And Hunt makes such a task infinitely more difficult because he forgot to bring his gun along with him, really? Bond and Bourne surely wouldn't make such a rookie mistake. Verdict: a total lack of originality, an absence of humour and clarity all combine to bring you the weakest instalment of the franchise. Next time Ethan please remember to bring your gun.",

Maybe if Tom jumped the fountain at Caesar's Palace on a motorcycle you might be impressed, probably not though, you would find a way. Mi6 stands up well regardless of the stupid one star ratings that the disenfranchised gave. I believe it was 2015 me and my teenage son went to see Mad Max Fury Road, we were like wow that was insane and it had crazy stunts too down in the outback, a raw and entertaining action movie. Walking out of the theater from this Mad Max movie people were talking and a black lady by herself middle-aged or so and she commented to herself that was terrible. I looked at my son and I said if the movie was so terrible, and it was raw, why didn't she leave the movie theater much sooner ? She could have left well before the halfway point instead of watching the whole thing. MI6 is definitely a good action movie and it stands up well with the characters and dialogue. If this genre of movie does not excite you then go watch something else. No MI6 will not displace Gone With the Wind on the all-time movie list but it was never intended to. if you enjoy a great action movie watch MI6 in IMAX or an upscale home theater system ",

The film is relentlessly suspenseful, and the characters on both sides of this fight are executed amazingly by their respective actors; the story makes great use of this, too, providing some of the most emotionally intense writing since the third entry. The story does harken back to the initial film's complexity and tone, but in a way that respects the franchise while the other elements innovate it.

Forget ever-changing, overly-serious Jack Ryan. Forget forgetful, mirthless Bourne. Ethan Hunt is my spy idol. And with Fallout, McQuarrie and Cruise have delivered easily their most impossible (and best) mission yet. A globe trekking, twisting-and-turning, intensely exciting sequel that continues and expands the reigning power of this unlikely blockbuster franchise.\nOnce again, Hunt and his crew find themselves amid a potential global disaster, on the outs with their own government and the criminal underground. What sets this one apart is its story and plot connections with the previous films. Where the others are essentially stand-alone outings, letting you jump in where you please, this one requires you to have a modicum of knowledge on Hunt and his exploits, allowing for growth in characters and stronger stakes in the villain's mysterious plots. \nAs expected, there are an endless number of great reveals that beautifully unravel information only when necessary. Thanks to some stellar editing, it's predictable when it isn't important, and unpredictable when it is, making the mysteries and the marquee action scenes that much more impacting.\nHonestly, God bless Tom Cruise and his lack of self-preservation. At 52, he is one of the last true action stars who sells a movie purely by putting his name on it, thanks largely to his renown for doing his own action. And with bathroom fist fights, helicopter chases, and skydiving malfunctions, what action it is. I always think this should be the last Mission with Cruise before seeing the most recent outing; by the end I just want more.",

Tom is, once again, at his very best. It's really incredible that he doesn't use stuntmen for any of the action scenes.

            "content": "There\u2019s obviously a working relationship between Tom Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, this being their third project together after the previous M:I - Rogue Nation and the first Jack Reacher. Both films I was very impressed with overall, especially the action sequences and I certainly wasn\u2019t disappointed here, which makes me hope this relationship continues should the saga expand, which I\u2019m sure it will. Ethan Hunt is back on the trail of trying to eliminate the shadowy, terrorist organisation, The Syndicate following on from Rogue Nation. There\u2019s the obvious threat to humanity and no one\u2019s seems to be able to stop it, or even want to stop it, apart from Ethan Hunt and the remaining IMF team. All sounds pretty standard for espionage spy actioners but there\u2019s a couple of little clever twists and conflict of interest, even if quite predictable. The team is much of the same characters we should all be familiar with, the story again overlooks the absence of past members like Jeremy Renner\u2019s Brandt, repeating what Rogue Nation did with Paula Patton\u2019s Jane. However the addition of Henry Cavill\u2019s Walker is a welcome change, but does he do fill the boots of being Hunt\u2019s opposite and likely looming threat. He sure is the hammer to Hunt\u2019s scalpel but I found him a little underwhelming and not menacing enough with this being the only weakness of the story. Personally, I wished they developed his character a lot more but maybe I\u2019m asking too much. I was pleased to see Vanessa Kirby after watching her in the low budget Kill Command. Her character of the double-sided, trickster fence was more intriguing than Cavill\u2019s Walker. The action is sharp and often brutal with some of the best, slickest sequences of the entire series. Especially with Cruise\u2019s impressive stunt work which seems to be the foundation of this film\u2019s hype. Believe me, the hype is real and it\u2019s action-packed from start to finish with some little moments of heart; there is one scene where I thought Cruise was going to break into Jerry Maguire\u2019s \u201chelp me, help you!\u201d It doesn\u2019t let up hitting the audience hard and fast with fights, car chases, van chases, motorbikes, parachute jumps and helicopters. It ticks all the boxes for what makes a great action film great. This is a fest in itself for being the longest in the franchise. But, it\u2019s downgraded it\u2019s outrageous scenarios, excluding the grand finale. And this was actually very refreshing. There\u2019s no scaling of the Burj Khalifa, no free diving down a giant urinal or sliding down a glass building and dodging missiles. It\u2019s as if they wanted a more real action movie pushing aside the elaborate CGI effects and gave us a raw, high-octane and grounded action piece. Instead of a CGI budget, the money must have been spent of the editing and production units as the sequences and shoots are astonishing shot and equally spliced together. And then there\u2019s those moments of heart which are mostly reserved for Ferguson\u2019s story arc adding to that conflict of interest. There is a moment that had me echoing the same emotional connection I had with Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man 2, though I\u2019m probably on my own with that one. And these are both small and too far in between all the action that goes on barely giving the audience enough time to catch a breathe, let alone digest what\u2019s going on. Though this is a negative observation and is a likely result of the film being a caffeine-dosed version of the saga. And then there\u2019s Lorne Balde\u2019s impressive score. Balfe is now one of my favourite composers however the Zimmerish influence is impossible to deny. You only have to listen to tracks \u201cChange of Plan\u201d to pick up Zimmer\u2019s Batman Trilogy or \u201cFree Fall\u201d to hear the looming threat of Dunkirk. But it perfectly incorporates Lalo Schifrin\u2019s iconic theme throughout the score to hair-raising effect. Balfe does this with such craftsmanship and respect to the original theme, it becomes very much part of the score as oppose to just being a remixed or reworked version. Just listen to tracks \u201cThe Exchange\u201d and \u201cEscape Through Paris\u201d to hear what I\u2019m talking about. It has to said because it\u2019s something that normally niggles me when films get it wrong, but whilst the timing might be a little off, it\u2019s geographically accurate, in particular London. All the scenes were spot on and it\u2019s a refreshing change. It might not be so obviously to most viewers but to me, the London locations, even the unimportant scenes are all in sync meaning you could draw a logical and chronological map of action in the city. However, I can only speak of London, as Paris I\u2019m not too familiar with. It\u2019s the best of the series, possibly because it\u2019s actually more grounded yet upping the action content. It\u2019s going to be a hard movie to top. I definitely want to go watch this again.

            "content": "Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" is the sixth movie of the franchise with the same name, so it is expected of it to be dull, boring and cliche. This movie however, exceeds expectations in every way possible, and shows heart and soul throughout what could very well just another payday for Mr. Cruise and Paramount Pictures.\n\nWe have come to expect mediocre action from action movies in recent years, thanks to movies like Fast & Furious, but here the fights, the chases, the near-death situations are all very well shot and edited - not for one second will the viewer doubt that Tom Cruise is indeed capable of pulling off all these amazing stunts by himself. This, paired with a brilliant cast (Henry Cavill once again shines, this time as the villain, great performances by Vanessa Kirby and the quirky duo of Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg), delivers a phenomenal 2 and a half hours of cinema. \nStill, at times, it all feels a little rough around the edges, thanks to a sometimes confusing storyline (that will make a good bunch of casual viewers tune out after a while), even if at the end, it all kind of  makes sense. \nThe cinematography is tremendous, with some seriously gorgeous shots of Paris throughout the movie, the soundtrack is good but nothing special. \n\nOverall, \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" delivers what it promises: a thrilling action-movie, with a fantastic cast, great action sequences and a competent plot. It's a well-structured movie with relatable good-guys and detestable bad-guys, and sometimes... that's all its needed to make a good movie.",

            "content": "When it comes to action movies, Tom Cruise has no equal. Tom's commitment to creating action films that give the audience their money's has reached almost ridiculous levels with Fallout. To fall back on the old cliches, this is a true white-knuckle, breath-holding, heart-pounding action adventure that is excellently paced and perfectly executed. The only thing more pleasing than the incredible action is the fact that this is probably the best story of the franchise, leveraging not just Ethan's history, but that of the team that he's assembled and evolved through the previous 5 films, into a far more multi-faceted character, facing challenges which are personal, global, complex yet still straight-forward.. or at least as complex as you can really get in an action film. \nMost people know by now just how seriously Cruise takes his action; spending months honing new skills so he can do as many of his own stunts as possible, and doing as many stunts as possible in camera. He clearly expects, demands, and inspires the same level of excellence from everyone who works on his films, and Fallout may be the most extreme example of this nexus of passion, talent, expectation and execution.\nNow as far as stories go, Fallout doesn't really do anything you haven't seen in an MI film before. The film is full of exhilarating chase sequences with cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters and of course, Tome Cruise Running.  The story follows the familiar territory of the world in peril and the only thing standing in the way of its destruction is Ethan Hunt and his team, who of course must at some point go it alone as again, his agency turns its back on him. You'd think that this basic plot structure would get old and stale, but in fact, each film seems to refine and improve on this basic structure in a way that not only remains fresh and entertaining, but when you're in the midst of it and you know that certain basic things are going to happen/have to happen,  you (for the most part) have typically have very little idea where they're going to come form specifically, Equally as impressive is that even though you can never see more than one step ahead, the story while complex, is never incomprehensible,.you are always given enough to understand what is happening, what's at stake at any given moment, and then it once all the strands are in place for the final showdown, they still the conclusion remains tense and with enough risk to keep you deeply engaged throughout. I was truly impressed at how after six films, they've managed to make each film better than the last (with the exception of MI2, sorry, that is the dog of this franchise) and MI6 seems almost impossible to top in my opinion.\nFallout is the definition of a big-budget action film.",

            "content": "They say lightning never strikes twice, much less three times. Yet for the third time in a row the Mission Impossible franchise has absolutely nailed it, delivering heart pounding, supremely satisfying summer entertainment.\n\nThose who have seen the trailers will have a basic idea of the story. Ethan Hunt and his team lost a trio of plutonium cores, and now he has to get them back by whatever methods necessary. Now despite what the trailers suggest, this movie is not about Ethan snapping and going rogue. The movie never even suggests it. But it is very much about whether he'll reach his limits and break his own most deeply held rules to complete the mission. Because with the stakes this high and with so many different players and agendas, there may not be any way to save the world and keep his hands clean.\n\nThis movie is also very much about Ethan's past. In many ways this installment is a continuation of the last film, featuring old friends and enemies and tying up loose plots threads you never noticed before. So much of what happens here is the direct result of the missions Ethan has completed and the choices he made before, all of them weighing heavily on the choices he has to make now. \n\nAfter six installments in the series the filmmakers have fully perfected the Mission Impossible formula. The pacing ranges from quick to breakneck. The chases and shoot-outs are excellent as always, and some of the fight scenes are worthy of Hong Kong. Henry Cavil is a powerhouse. The pure power of his fighting style is a perfect match for Hunt's kinetic improvisation. Fighting together they make a hell of a duo. When they come to blows with each other it's even better.\n\nAnd then there are the aerial sequences and other death-defying stunts that no Mission Impossible movie would be complete without. They may not top the data core scene from the last installment, but they are still absolutely breathtaking. I don't know how Cruise is able to keep doing these kinds of stunts at his age, but I can't argue with the results.\n\nAnd refreshingly, the plot is more than just an excuse to string together the action scenes. There are enough twists and stunning revelations to fill the best spy novel. Just when you think you know where it's going it manages to surprise and raise the stakes even higher. At times Fallout is a bit darker and grimmer than previous installments. Occasionally it even brings a touch of pathos. But the trademark wry humor is still there, if a little more subdued.\n\nUltimately this movie has everything that a summer blockbuster should. It's tense, exciting, action packed, and everything in it just works. On the heels of Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation it's safe to say that the Mission Impossible franchise is delivering more consistently than than James Bond. I don't how long they can keep this up, but I look forward to finding out.",

            "content": "Mission Impossible returns this year with another mission that may be impossible for anyone else, but not for Tom Cruise because that man can run like he's sponsored by Nike. After the success that was Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015) having Christopher McQuarrie return for Fallout\u00a0was the right way to go and he shows that he has his finger on the pulse of this franchise. Just when you thought the action couldn't get any crazier McQuarrie uses his ability to gradually build suspense over time keep you locked in. This story takes place following a mission that goes wrong which leaves the IMF to race against the clock and put a stop to the threat. Once it kicks into gear it's fun, fast paced, and brings everything you expect from a Mission Impossible film to the table. You get the charismatic and ever so likeable ensemble, big action set-pieces, plot-turning twists, and Ethan Hunt running harder than he's ever run before.\n\n\n\nThe cast this time around is a great one packed with big names both new to the game and returning. Tom Cruise as far as I'm concerned IS Ethan Hunt, he can be in any number of action franchises but this the one character I feel like he nails every time. He really is a true movie star as his on-screen charisma sells you completely on all of these stunts which in reality wouldn't be nearly as successful. His tight-knit crew returns in the form of Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames who share a number of great on-screen moments with Cruise and have their fair share of light comedic moments here and there. Rebecca Ferguson also returns in an interesting role with an intriguing arc which keeps her around and very much in the thick of the action. On the villains side of things Sean Harris is back as Solomon Lane, he's such an absolute joy to watch as a villain and plays the role very well. The major newcomer is Henry Cavill who is sporting his Justice League-killing moustache whilst getting in on a number of action sequences. It can be hard at times to see him as someone other than Superman but he plays the role well here and keeps your mind off that.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs for the progression of the story I will say it isn't quite as fast paced and right into the action in the beginning as I thought it'd be. But it doesn't take its time either, McQuarrie cleverly builds suspense with each successive sequence to where I found myself enjoying this movie more and more as it went on. In some aspects you could see where things were heading but for the majority of the story I had fun trying to figure out what tricks Hunt is going to pull off to get out of his many tough situations. It oddly felt like a wholly original experience within the shell of a story that I'm sure you've seen a number of times. There are these elements within the Mission Impossible franchise from the music, to the Ethan Hunt character, and the way it approaches spy-thriller action that make each one feel unique even though it's just a race against the clock story with some twists and turns here and there. As I mentioned it does take its time to ease you into the story and give people a bit of a refresher on what has happened in the franchise so far so you really don't need to have seen any of the previous entries to follow this story. I was a little lukewarm on the film in the first act but seeing how it all builds towards a strong finale it's worth the journey.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe action takes centre-stage once again and seeing how it's going to one-up itself every time is part of the fun. Cruise was strapped to a plane in Rogue Nation but somehow he manages to up the stakes again this time around.\u00a0 Not only are the stunts and action sequences bigger but there are much more of them to fill the runtime. With each consecutive one it upped the stakes significantly and kept the story moving at a quick pace, not letting it meander around on some slower moments. The fight sequences, chase scenes, car scenes, helicopter scenes, they're all immensely fun to watch and capture what it is to be a Mission Impossible movie. When the iconic theme kicks in at some key moments it never fails to get you pumped and ready for the action. McQuarrie has created another gem in this spy-thriller franchise and I honestly just want him to keep going, maybe hire a stunt-double for Cruise next time so he doesn't kill himself though.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, with that we say goodbye to another Mission Impossible film and a great one at that. It's one of those rare franchises that seems to have found its tone, its niche, and just finds ways to keep pumping out great thrill rides. The non-stop action will keep you invested and going along with a crew of great characters and actors makes the whole thing that much more enjoyable. There's rarely a dull moment as it builds in intensity as it progresses towards a finale that caps it all off to a tee. Fans of the franchise know what they're getting into and newcomers can also enjoy this entry without any prior knowledge of the 5 films that came before it.\u00a0\n\n8.1/10",

            "content": "The Last Movie Star.\n\nIf one were to write a biography of Tom Cruise, that would have to be the title. Over the past several decades, Hollywood has come to rely less and less on the draw of large personalities. Most blockbusters are now marketed with spectacle and imagery, not names above the title. Yet Cruise remains. Like a dogged survivor in one of his films, he's living history stalking the tall grass of change, continually proving his own industry wrong.\n\nAnd, if Mission: Impossible - Fallout is any indication, he has no intention of slowing down. Not only is the movie the most action-packed of the series, it may also be the best. Mind, this doesn't mean it's a masterpiece; the bar hasn't been set especially high when it comes to depth and intelligence. But if you enjoy the franchise, particularly the last two entries, it would be a true chore to dislike this one.\n\nThe plot-always secondary in these films, always a bit too complicated for its own good-begins in Belfast. There, IMF* agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) learns of a splinter group of assassins who call themselves the 'Apostles' and have essentially become terrorists-for-hire. They're trying to get their hands on a trio of recently-stolen plutonium cores (you can guess the reason). Also involved are an anarchist named John Lark and the previous film's villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).\n\nAfter a botched exchange in Berlin, in which the plutonium is lost, Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames) are tasked by IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) with recovering the cores through a meeting in Paris between Lark and a black-market broker known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). Still with me? Suffice to say aborted directives, double-crosses and general chaos follow the key players from Europe all the way to the edge of the Himalayas, where Hunt's past finally catches up with him.\n\nOne thing I greatly admire in movies is ambition. As evidenced by the story, Fallout holds nothing back. Whether or not it covers the most geographic ground in the franchise, it plays like the biggest entry. Whereas past missions were stop-gaps, this is a culmination. Stakes rise, secrets are revealed; lives change.\n\nAt least, on screen. Oh that such emotions extended to the audience. But, for the most part, that effect has been absent from M:I's M.O. for quite some time. Not since the third movie did the narrative forsake its glossy, stunt-riddled surface to mine genuine feeling. And M:I-3 made the least amount of money in the franchise, so it's understandable that such a personal direction would be rerouted. \n\nBut without it, Mission: Impossible-and Fallout specifically-is destined to be the prettiest belle at a second-rate ball. For all its globe-trotting, it's only a partial experience. We see all-and are amazed-but feel little, and remember less. Each character is more caricature than human being, trading the details of life for the whims of a streamlined script. Like Marvel or The Fast and the Furious, Fallout doesn't present reality; it paraphrases it.\n\nSome may call this nitpicking, and they wouldn't be far off. But the bar must be raised when it comes to depth, because it's already been surpassed in nearly every other aspect. Visually, Fallout is a ball of frenetic joy, a feast for the eyes. The scenery is always changing; we can imagine the cameras struggling to keep up with such a rapidly unfolding plot. \n\nThat plot, though, can be its own worst enemy. There are only so many twists a story can stand before each one starts to mean a little less.\n\nThankfully, other factors maintain our attention. Lorne Balfe's score adds some taught variation to Lalo Schifrin's classic theme. And while each member of the cast does fine, Henry Caville stands out as a mysterious CIA officer. The role fits him better than Superman's tights.\n\nBut in the end, it all comes back to Cruise. He's the reason we watch, and his relentless energy fuels the entire franchise. Fallout runs Hunt through the requisite gauntlet of stunts: hanging from a helicopter above mountainous terrain; speeding through the packed streets of Paris on a motorcycle; skydiving from thirty-thousand feet. \n\nBut more than death-defying acrobatics is the quality they signify: devotion. When an actor who has nothing left to prove consistently gives everything he's got, admiration is easy.\n\n* In case you were curious, 'IMF' stands for Impossible Missions Force.",

            "content": "The Mission franchise is an interesting one.  It's spanned over 20 years, has only had two actors appear in every film, has never fully embraced continuity, and has undoubtedly gone through many production issues.  Alas, it's also one of the greatest franchises because it has defied what it means to impress audience with action and it keeps getting better and better with every film.  Although admittedly, I'm not exactly sure how it can get any better from here.  I saw this movie early, and instantly felt it was one of the best action movies of all time, but I also knew I needed to see it at least one more time before I really did give it that title.  Well, I've seen the film 4 times now and each time further cemented my feelings. Everything from the Halo jump, to the middle act (which is essentially one long chase sequence), to the callbacks, to the Helicopter scene, to Henry Cavill's unnecessary but totally bada** facial hair.  Mission: Impossible Fallout is an unbelievable ride that simply never lets up.  Even in its quiet moments, it has touching dialogue that makes the action more weighted.  Even in my 4 viewings, I've never been bored, and I can't wait to see it again.  It also surprisingly had a great amount of emotional stakes, something the serious didn't really have since Mission 3.  There are a few moments with Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Michelle Monaghan that really hit me emotionally, and I never would have expected that from this series.  It has the best antagonist(s) since Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and maybe even better, the action is easily the most impressive in years (probably since Fury Road), and the actors have never been better.   If there's going to be another one, then take your time and do it right, because this could very well be the best conclusion possible for the series.  Thank you to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie for making this an instant classic. \n\n10/10",

Every scene feels truly brutal and powerful. I love movies with this very brutal action scenes that feel very much like John Wick or Winter Solder. Every punch given feels harder and it makes the stakes feel higher than they are. And Tom Cruise only adds to that with his action also not being perfect. He isn't the perfect fighter in the film. There are scenes where he falls and gets hurt and you feel that. Moments of just real intensity that just blow you away.\n\nHenry Cavil also plays a great yang to Tom Cruise as his really ramps up every scene he is in and heck even steals the show at certain points and I absolutely love that.He pulls off every scene he is in with great flare and a mustache to boot to go along with it. Was the mustache needed? I don;t really think so, but it was a great add on anyway. \n\nThe movie's greatest weakness is its execution of its twist. The twist really feel forced and unneeded at times for me. More to give a big gasp over anything else. Im not going to give away the twist here, but there is a scene or rather a collection of scenes back to back when we get one twist after the other and it feels really dragging. \n\nOverall though Mission Impossible is a fun time at the theater and one I'd highly recommend.",

            "content": "I CHOOSE TO ACCEPT IT - My Review of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT (4 Stars)\n\nWow!  (Wait 5 seconds)  Wow!  (Wait another 5 seconds) Wow!  Yep, that about sums up the experience of watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT, the incredibly entertaining, endlessly thrilling new entry in the beloved movie franchise which started with the bar pretty high when Brian De Palma directed the first and has continued along with quite good results.  Christopher McQuarrie, who directed the last installment, continues here and while not exactly making a film for the ages, he has produced a whopping feat in action cinema.  This is one start-to-finish set piece extravaganza and a shining example of studio blockbuster entertainment made right.\nTom Cruise returns as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt and this time, he and his cohorts need to thwart the sale of plutonium before it gets in the wrong hands and destroys the planet.  Yep, it's that simple and the streamlined plot, expertly laid out, makes it easier to ride along from one crazy sequence after another.  It's a terrific setup. I love that McQuarrie has chosen not to update the old school reel-to-reel tape spelling out Hunt's mission.  There's a fizzy feeling when the tape self-destructs, leaving a trail of smoke as it always has and as it always should be!\nAs Ethan and his teammates (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) avoid mortal danger in the opening scenes, a wonderfully pulpy, clever twists sends us off to a blazing title sequence, all of which caused the audience I was in to applaud a couple of times...but this movie is just getting started.\nEnter CIA honcho played by Angela Bassett, who doesn't trust Ethan et al to get the goods, so she assigns her own strongman, August Walker, to shadow them. He's played by Henry Cavill, and if he weren't a star already, this film would turn him into one.  He may not deliver his expository lines with a master's touch.  In fact, he's pretty wooden at times, but overall, this is a fantastic, iconic performance.  Whether he's skydiving with Cruise, or taking part in one of the most thrilling bathroom fight sequences I've seen (on a par with EASTERN PROMISES), or...well there are so many, just go and see for yourself.  Cavill is all moustache, tight suits, and hulking action moves as he towers over Cruise and makes a true mark in the film.  Cavill brings out a great competitive spirit in Cruise, giving their scenes a spark...some may categorize that spark as the most homoerotic/ men fighting type since Ken Russell's WOMEN IN LOVE...or they just punch and growl at each other a lot.  You figure it out.  \nAlso on hand to make things pop is Rebecca Ferguson as Hunt's Ally/Enemy, Ilsa Faust.  She's so good, and it's such a relief to see her shine again after the dismal SNOWMAN from earlier this year.  MVP honors, however, go to Vanessa Kirby as White Widow, a spooky negotiator who floats in and out of the film with an alien air of mystery.  She's weird in a Tilda Swinton meets Lady Gaga way, and the film benefits from all that is her.  \nBut, of course, these films live or die because of Tom Cruise.  As he gets older, he has eschewed so much of his All American Boy spirit, replacing it with a tired, world-weariness which works wonders when you're faced with certain nuclear destruction.  Knowing that he likes to do as many of his own stunts as possible seems to work wonders when enjoying these scenes. In this film, he skydives, rides a motorcycle through Paris, runs thrillingly across rooftops, flies a helicopter and dangles from a lot of ropes, whether they're hanging from said copter or from the side of a steep cliff, and we as an audience applaud his...I don't know...insane willingness to die for us?  I guess that's what it is.  Tom Cruise wants to die for our sins!  Whatever the case, this is a performance to be treasured for its laser-focused commitment to action.\nSure, it's not perfect.  There's one scene I'm calling EXPOSITION FOR DUMMIES, because the characters tell us what's happening, and just in case we missed it, they say it all over again.  It's an odd moment reeking of studio notes to make sure everything is crystal clear.  Also, Michele Monaghan once again gets straddled with a nothing role, and folks, she's a great, great actor.  Can somebody please use her well asap?  \nBut, pretty much everything else about this film works phenomenally.  McQuarrie knows just where to put the camera, turning even a simple early moment of a car pulling up into a swooping, swirling thrill.  McQuarrie also truly understands suspense and the joy of well-earned reveals and clever callbacks.  It's still a thrill when people tear away rubber masks in these movies.  I walked away from MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT (really clever title btw) simultaneously exhausted and satisfied, which is clearly McQuarrie, Cruise and company's mission.",

            "content": "The hype is real.  So resuming where the last movie left off, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team are still picking up the pieces of a mission gone wrong.  Seems like the criminal organization known as The Syndicate has now become The Apostles, and they are bent on obtaining plutonium so as to construct bombs for nefarious purposes.  Will IMF be able to save the day?  Now I wasn't actually sold by the trailers of this.  It's not that they looked bad, it just didn't look like anything that wasn't already covered in Rogue Nation, which was simply a decent film.  I was going to skip it or at the very least wait until home release... that is, until the rave reviews started to pour in.  A 97% fresh rating on rottentomatoes is enough for me to take any film seriously, and let me go ahead and cut the tension: this does not disappoint.  Now if this ended up being as good as Ghost Protocol, I was going to walk out of the theater a happy camper.  While I personally prefer the fourth film, Fallout is not a movie to be trifled with.  This is a story that doesn't really ever let up as far as the action goes.  As soon as the opening credits stop, it keeps moving from rewarding set piece to rewarding set piece.  Every action sequence in this has payoff, and I will go out on a limb and say that you are not going to see better choreographed action all summer.  It is refreshing because there is a lack of CGI in this.  When given the choice, director Christopher McQuarrie chooses actually doing the stunt instead of covering it up in post production at least 95% of the time if not more.  This especially puts you in the moment when there is gigantic spectacle happening all around, and to be frank, that's exactly what I watch blockbusters for.  I caught myself holding my breath at a number of different points in this, and the action is shot about as well as it can be filmed.  The locations are exotic and terrific, and Tom Cruise shows no sign of slowing down despite being over five and a half decades old.  Everything is tied together by an amazing score, and while it wasn't composed by Hans Zimmer, it gave me Dark Knight vibes like whoa.  I prefer Ghost Protocol because it is more of a fun wow, and this is more of a serious wow.  It really boils down to what your personal preference is, but this is something you should still see on as big of a screen as possible.",

The reason why he's always rouge is to protect his friends and loved ones and not to mention the entire life force. The same charisma applies to the latest franchise, unlike any other Mission Impossible movies in Fallout Ethen Hunt shows his compassion to other beings, how he respects an innocent sole, just like the Dragon Ball character Goku,Hunt show's his naive part by sparing the life's of... yeah even his enemies' like Solomon Lane.\n\nNaive part of Goku and Ethan Hunt\nOk, Now to the main part about the movie, well the movie begins from where Rouge nation ends, after the Syndicate got neutralized a lot of people linked to it where caught or killed, where as there were still some(The Apostles,a terrorist group) who's real identities were unknown and they plans to have some massive destruction and terror by using an element called Plutonium, Ethan's Mission is to get that Plutonium in safe hands of the C.I.A, well that's about it, I ain't gonna reveal the whole story to give some spoilers so that I could destroy the whole mood of yours, Jeez I am not that evil. So let's get to the part where I say about the technical, directional and other stuffs about the movie, shall we???\n\nThe Positives's\n\nThe Stunt's: What about the stunt's? What about it, for God's sake we're talking about Tom Cruise here. That's right the stunt's are undoubtedly the best not just in the whole career of Tom Cruise but may be one of the greatest stunt's ever in the history of cinema, the stunt's alone will make you happy for the money you've spent on that ticket you've brought.\n\nTom Cruise helicopter stunt in Fallout\nThe Plot: The plot of the movie is well written and well directed thanks to the Director/Script Writer Christopher McQuarrie who did his once Academy Award winning magic(McQuarrie won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Usual Suspects).\n\nTechnologically the movie's on top level, you will find the camera angles and the VFX mind blowing. Before you go just checkout some shots at Nolan movies like The Dark Knight, you're gonna love Mission Impossible-Fallout's Visual's, well of course Christopher Nolan's on anoter level but so do Christopher McQuarrie.\n\nThe Cast: Well the cast, ha no word, Tom Cruise,Henry Cavill,Ving Rhames,Simon Pegg,Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan,Angela Bassett,Alec Baldwin,etc.. are perfectly aligned, It was a good call casting The Superman against Ethan Hunt so that the Superman realizes it's not just batman who can stop him if he goes berserk(lol), and oops can't help it another tiny spoiler, It was a good call casting Both Michelle Monaghan and Wes Bentley(You'll know what I mean when you see the movie) got some good sense of humor flowing through the veins between some hardcore actions without effecting the plot.\n\nMission Impossible Fallout Cast Poster\nThe list goes on and on\n\nThe Negative's\n\nSean Harris's go less screen presence.\n\nSean Harris's less screen presence is a negative in Mission Impossible Fallout\nWhy is Jeremy Renner's William Brandt not in the movie??? Well we know it's because of his Hawkeye character he's been playing for the Infinity War Sequel, but hey Jeremy you're been missed in the movie.\n\nHawkeye over William Brandt\nCan't think of any other negatives.\n\nThe movie won't make you regret for your money and time, go for it without fear, Go get it Tiger.......\n\nJohn Wick and Eathan Hunt Actions\nFinal Verdict: One of The best Action movies of recent times especially when you consider the plot, Mission: Impossible - Fallout falls under the best category of Action with Good plot just like John Wick: Chapter 2 or may be even better since it got some humor too. I will give it a 4.5/5\n\nVisit http://oakshow.in/Profiles/CriticProfiles/JithinJPrasad/mission-impossible-fallout-review-by-jithin-j-prasad.html to read my review properly.",

Also, the funny banter usually found with the IMF team fell flat. I could tell they were trying to be funny but it just did not work. The actors who make up the IMF team are starting to show their age, and I sincerely hope this will be the last installment of this franchise. Go out on a high note.",

            "content": "Everything you want from a Mission Impossible movie is present and accounted for in this sixth instalment of Tom Cruise's teflon franchise: the McGuffin plot chock full of double and triple crosses; visceral and punishing hand-to-hand combat; chase sequences in the air, by car, motorbikes, and even helicopters; the trademark Tom Cruise running (here extended for your viewing pleasure); the return of old favourites like Simon Pegg's Benji and Rebecca Fegurson's Isla Faust and the introduction of new ones like Vanessa Kirby's fun but underused White Widow (which has great potential for the next film); and of course, the impossibly elaborate and audacious mission which will always be figured out by the IMF team headed by Cruise's Ethan Hunt. However, the real Mission: Impossible is how Cruise and returning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie manages to avoid staleness and repetition in an ageing franchise and not only manage to mount a series of spectacular and expectations-defying action sequences but also makes the normally contrived, if not implausible, action narrative that link it all together feels relevant and believable. Smaller scenes in between the explosive and daring sequences and expositions actually delivers humour, sophistication and class, even, unexpectedly. With a half decent script and excellent pacing, I was totally gripped and exhausted by the end of the tension-filled 2hrs+ experience which left me gasping on the edge of my seat, and quite happy to forgive minor sins such as Henry Cavill's obviously written character (with that infamous moustache) and the almost superpowers some characters possess to be exactly at the right place at the right time either by coincidence or design. Meticulously and brilliantly executed, this is already front-runner for Action Movie of 2018, and contender for best of the series and could, in time, surpass my fondness for M:I3 one day.",

The effort Mr Cruise and Co put into MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE FALLOUT will payout tenfold. It is already on track to be the highest rating and highest grossing MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE movie and the good news from this is that they will be making more. Action movies of recent years have become fatiguing, we have seen it all, been impressed as much as we could, but MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE FALLOUT laughs in the face of common place and done-before, it just throws its star out of anything moving and hopes he survives.

This may, to a very large extent, seem like a carbon copy of any James Bond movie except for one major factor. Tom Cruise. With age catching up on the Hollywood heartthrob, it is his sheer perseverance, grit, determination and hard work that makes the movie a successful venture. An actor well past his prime, volunteers to perform his stunts himself even after repeated injuries all this when you are 56 years old, deserves not just a pat on the back but all the adulation that he can.\n              Commercial movies are an expensive product. Add in Tom Cruise, the expenses just doubled. However, when there is a sure shot formula for a successful movie, the budget to make one would just be a secondary concern as you have the best technicians at your service. In such an environment, the technical aspects of the movie will far excel the expected output and redraw boundaries and set new standards for all future movies. Mission Impossible : Fallout is the standard template on how to make a successful commercial movie while elevating itself as a wholesome movie.\nFor the complete and detailed review, check out the link : https://akhileshchetty.wordpress.com/2018/07/31/mission-impossible-fallout-movie-review/",

It seems like the last three or four have been really good and the first one or two were only so-so.  Now we have Mission Impossible Fallout.  First the  good stuff, as visually the stunts and action here rival any movie.  The reason being is CGI is used only when necessary, and it doesn't replace real live stunts.  Everyone falls back into their roles quite nicely, and the story is interesting enough to hold our attention.  The downside to me is that there are too many \"no way\" sequences.  Tom Cruise can't run in an all out sprint for over five minutes.  I mean come on?  The helicopter chase while visually really cool is also a little too far fetched for me.  Also, a fifteen minute countdown in the movie actually took 25 minutes (I looked at my watch out of curiosity).  All that being said, the twists and turns are pretty cool.  You see some from a mile away, and others are a good surprise.  It's a solid sequel, but I'd like to see some more weight and depth to it if they continue.",

Well, expecting an all out A-class performance in every mainstream crash & bang action flick is being too disective. However the close-up vivid shots & wide angle shots for all the action portions were sharp & without a doubt showed off the excellence of VFX. But the cinematography, I'll say it was just above average. All in all, the films quick & intelligible screenplay didn't bore one bit but in overall Fallout wasn't memorable.\n\nRating:  6.8/10",

This feels the most like the tv series of the six imf films. it has excellent cinematography, supported by an energetic and driving score that uses lalo schifrin's original score rather well. None of that awful shakey cam fighting here, just concise editing that clearly communicates the action and geography of each sequence. the fight choreography team bring a bruising physicality to the combat, and it's a big improvement over the invunerable ethan hunt from the earlier outings. this is tom cruises best film for ages.

            "content": "It has taken on average 3.5 years for Tom Cruise to release Mission Impossible movies since the first came out back in 1999.  For my money over the last 20 years, this is the best action franchise in Hollywood still making movies.  I stated it after I saw Ghost Protocol and again after Rogue Nation; Tom Cruise - love him or hate him - is Hollywood's best action hero.  Much like those other two film I just mentioned, Fallout earns its 5-star rating and cements the franchise as one of the best.\n\nCruise is an anomaly.  Both revered for his acting chops but seared for his off-camera beliefs and actions in his private life, I think he has mostly leveled out as a pretty genuine guy since he left the day-to-day spotlight a handful of years ago.  He is the best action star Hollywood has for this generation.  He's a self-proclaimed perfectionist.  Every stunt (all done himself), every thread, and every interaction in the movie is tailored to his vision.  The movie is a mirror to Cruise as an actor: exhilarating, cool, humorous, and a bit dangerous.  His stunts are breathtaking.  From the HALO jump in the opening third to the car chases, foot chases, and motorcycle chases in the middle to the unbelievable helicopter fight scene in the final third, Cruise leaves it all out on the table.  There's a point where he says to his team on the ground he won't let them down.  I have full confidence he meant for that to be a nod to the audience as well.\n\nAlso back for the first time is repeat director and famed Oscar-winning Hollywood screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie.  He filmed Rogue Nation, so it was only right he return to wrap up a story over the two films we saw begin in the former.  \n\nWhile I won't harp on the plot too much, we get a brief recap of what the team has been up to in the two years from the end of Rogue Nation to the start of Fallout. After that, it's off and running with twists, turns, dips, and dives of a classic spy thriller to keep track of where everyone stands.\n\nRebecca Ferguson, Ving Rames, Simon Pegg, and Alec Baldwin are all back.  The only conspicuous actor missing was Jeremy Renner due to a scheduling conflict, but I found it a tad off putting he wasn't even mentioned because he did survive Rogue Nation.  Also back is the villain, Sean Harris, as the vile Solomon Lane.  We get introduced to three new players as well: Angela Bassett as a CIA big wig, Henry Cavil as her CIA operative, and Vanessa Kirby as a new broker for bad guys (pay close attention to her story for those easter eggs).  All of them are tremendous in their roles.  \n\nOverall, if you are looking for the summer blockbuster that was promises but hadn't delivered because of a slow and tired Hollywood output, look no further.  MI6 continues to bring the pain and will almost certainly lend itself to a seventh film down the line.  It's just a shame we have to wait another 3.5 years to get the next.",

            "content": "Tom Cruise and company have returned for a sixth installment of the long running (6 films, 22 years) 'Mission Impossible' franchise. Who would've thought they'd save their best stuff for the sixth film? Here is my review of 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout.'\n\nIn the sixth film in the series we are reunited with Tom Cruise and his infamous 'Ethan Hunt' character as well as the rest of the gang, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. This film is directed and written by Christopher McQuarrie. This is the second 'Mission Impossible' he has directed, the first being 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' (2015). Following all the hype mustered up by this film I found myself surprisingly excited to see it. I got to see the opening day viewing and I was not disappointed. Christopher McQuarrie is the perfect director for these films as proven by two back-to-back successful films as well as this being, in my opinion, the best film in the franchise to date. 'Fallout' is a sheer epic. It has everything you want in an action film and it does it all perfectly. While giving the audience some intense and top-notch barrages of action, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie balanced in a very strong and clear pointed plot. This perfect balance made for a perfect action film. \n\nTom Cruise yet again delivers a strong performance and his stunts continue to be jaw-dropping. McQuarrie's direction with these action sequences are perfect and some stunning and edge-of-the-seat scenes do happen rather frequently in this film. Henry Cavill is also in this movie and it was great to finally see the now infamous-stache on the big screen. I had my slight doubts in him at times during the movie but continuously with each and every passing scene Cavill seemed to just get better and better. He brought a lot to the film and definitely served a strong purpose. Simon Pegg is entertaining as always, as is Ving Rhames. Sean Harris is also in the film and he brings a good strong presence as the films mysterious villainous character. Harris owns the role and brings genuine darkness to the film. \n\nWhat puts this film head and shoulders above other action flicks is the insane and pristine camera work. Some of the shots that were taken during this film are absolutely stunning and I found myself turning to the person beside me admiring these shots on several occasions. This all made for rather grand and certainly epic scenes. The moment I left the theatre I was ready to turn back around and head back in for more. \n\nWhile the story isn't necessarily fresh, Christopher McQuarrie does a good job at telling this story and unfolding a very picture-perfect spy film. There are some characters I definitely would have liked to have seen developed more. As previously stated, the brilliance in balance within the film is truly unmatched and story is not compromised at the hands of over usage of CGI or cheap jokes. This is the quintessential action movie of 2018 and the summer blockbuster we needed oh so badly.",

This film has surpassed its predecessors just as each installment has seemed to do.

His filmmaking will leave you feeling for each character, whether good or bad, and feeling every punch they take, as well. Proven with just one viewing, this film is a masterpiece. It\u2019s one for the shelf and one that\u2019ll entertain for decades and decades to come. Calling it close, as the IMF team famously does, is exactly what this film doesn\u2019t do. It calls it as soon as it starts its first scene because this one has taken the top of its series and of the summer. Action, adventure, suspense, running, HALO jumps, helicopter chases, and one hell of an ending that\u2019ll not be confirmed nor denied, of course, without the approval of the secretary. 10/10. -TE (7.28.18)",

            "content": "Now THIS is how you do a Summer Blockbuster Film! The mustache problems from Justice League was worth it in order for Henry Cavill's role to be more effective. This movie had everything you could ask for. All the crazy stunts were all done by Tom Cruise's stunt double, Tom Cruise! But seriously, it makes the action sequences that much more exciting knowing that Tom did all of his stunts. The supporting cast also did a wonderful job. The comedic relief couldn't be pulled off any more perfectly, without being out of place, by Simon Pegg as Benji. Ving Rhames, is the down to earth, tech specialist, Luther, who brings a calming presence to such frantic scenes. Rebecca Ferguson is essentially the badass MI6 agent, Ilsa, who brings a balance with her action scenes and love interest to Ethan Hunt. The story starts out with Ethan Hunt essentially trying to track 3 plutonium cores that he let get into the wrong hands, because he focused on saving one of his team members instead of sacrificing them to save the millions. Alex Baldwin is awesome as the head of the CIA. We are also graced by the ageless, Angela Bassett, who not only has short scenes, but brings a presence of authority that no other person could pull off. The only thing that may not be as powerful as the previous Mission Impossible entries is the musical score. Nothing really stood out to, specially since I've heard the likes of Hans Zimmer put their touch on the series. It was all mainly orchestral scores and it enhanced a lot of the scenes because there's so much going on. The cinematography is well done. The beautifully placed shots of the Kashmir regions and the way the scenes are composed fit perfectly to the movie. It didn't try to take something from a Paul Greengrass Bourne movie with its shaky cam styles, or a more muted color scheme like the latest Bond films. I recommend everybody to watch this film, specially while it's in the theater, to fully get that summer blockbuster feeling. The action scenes are so much better and you will have a great time, ooh-ing, aah-ing and gasping, much like my fellow moviegoers in the theater with me.",

MI6 has a great story. The story is actually incredible. It knows what was done in the past, it knows that people are going to figure our twists by now, so what was done? They twist the twist. It's just incredible.\n\nMusic in this film is also the best one yet in this franchise. When I saw Lorne Balfe's name at the start of the film, I was like 'It's such an obvious choice to have him on board'. He's made some incredible work in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series and having him here, bring that orchestral glory that the film needed so much. The usual theme track was completely transformed, it gave 'Fallout' the true sound and weight.\n\nOverall, I must say I don't think this franchise can get any better. I think It should be the last film, such a grand ending! If there's going to be more films coming, well I'm waiting, but It probably won't be superior to this, it's actually - mission impossible.",

            "content": "\"Your mission, should you *choose* to accept it.\" I wonder, did you ever choose not to? The end you've always feared is coming.\"\n\nWOAH!\n\nYou know, I normally stay cool and collective when movies with this amount of hype blows up, but f**k it. This freaking lived up to the hype. I mean, wow. Probably one of the best action movies of the year. From start till finish, you're captivated by the practicality of these action sequences. Never feeling repetitive or boring. Foot chase, car chase, or helicopter chase - It's going to be awhile for any action movie to top what they did.\n\nThis franchise has age like fine wine.\n\nFirst Things First, the action scenes - where do I begin? Or which scene to talk about. Oh yeah, THE BATHROOM SCENE! Holy sh*t, talk about a white-knuckled hand to hand fight. No dialogue, no music, and no shaky cam whatsoever. Rough and brutal with nothing pretty about it. Also Henry Cavill reloading his arms was the cherry on top. We will come back to Cavill later.\n\nThe halo sky dive scene was amazing and nuts, but what's even more nuts when you find out Tom Cruise did the stunt over 100 times. Along with poor Craig O'Brien, who captured the stunt from the massive IMAX camera. This explains why it was so intense to watch. Of course the helicopter sequence, which could have been 2 hours and 27 minutes long and I wouldn't be bored.\n\nThe sound design is really fantastic and really detailed with everything that's going on. You can hear the whoosh when someone throws a punch. Gunshots hitting brick walls or whizz by, brought up the intensity.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie returns as director for the sixth installment and I think he outdid himself. This guy knows how to set up 'the domino' effect with certain scenes to surprise and make your jaw drop. Masterpiece in film making and shot composition - beautifully done by cinematographer Rob Hardy. While it's unknown (right now) who will take over directing for the seven movie, but oh boy they got some shoes to fill. I don't think McQuarrie can top himself. Then again, I said something similar about 'Rogue Nation'. I will never learn.\n\nAnd hey, the villains were pretty menacing this time around. A rare thing sometimes in these movies.\n\nTom Cruise is nearly 60 years old and yet, continues to prove age is just a number. You can hate or criticize Cruise all you want, but you gotta respect someone who puts this much dedication in life threatening situations for the right take. An action star who puts in the hard work. He's basically killing himself for two hours.\n\nHenry Cavill makes a welcome addition to the franchise as a mustache twirling agent. Cavill is best known for playing superman and made a big name for himself, however the movies themselves failed to meet his success. In this movie, he plays a big bully who isn't afraid to kill on instinct. There's something deeply unpleasant about him. Every time he walks in frame with this stone cold look adds to the uneasiness. Especially during the fight scenes where Cavill shows off his physicality and fast brutal punches. This is the best I've seen from him. Justice League? Never heard of it.\n\nThe team dynamic was excellent and gives plenty of room for character development among the anarchy. Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Rebecca Ferguson are all terrific.\n\nHow is the actual story of the film? Well, nothing original just like the previous ones. Elevating on presentation and ties in with events on the other movies - Involving plenty of twist and turns. Some people may have an issue with that which I can understand. The film demands your attention throughout, as references are dropped left and right. The movie builds a lot off the previous film which you have to see or remember about, because if not, then you're lost.\n\nIf I have to pick any issue, it will have to be some of the score. Now don't get me wrong, I thought the score was good and blends perfectly along with the action scenes, but it did sound familiar. Yeah, 'The Dark Knight Rises' score. People have already brought this up, so I become more aware when listening. Bit distracting as I had the Every Frame a Printing video on 'Hollywood Scores & Soundtracks', in my mind. That's it really.\n\nOverall rating: Please do yourself a favor and see this on the biggest screen you can. The action, sound work, characters, and acting were all superb. Believe the hype!",

But, at some point, you just have to shake your head and stop reveling in just how much Tom Cruise's 58 year-old can really take and just how much luck or conincidence Ethan Hunt can count on. At a certain point, you just have to say \"come, on.\"\n\nAdd a plot that's always twisting and turning, outside of the obvious callbacks to previous M:I movies (you're who now?), the twist that almost every M:I movie has already made (really, who didn't see that coming?), music that goes from amazing to annoying - often in the same scene and runtime that just seemed to go on too long.\n\nIt can be - and is a fun movie, there are many gasp inducing moments. But, it almost seems to be \"look at what we can do\" action rather than move the plot along action. The awes are awesome and it makes for a thrilling ride... but outside of that, it's goes on too long and relies too much plot twists to be any sort of convincing spy caper.",

There are plots within plots, double crosses and triple crosses. The core of this mission has Tom Cruise and the IMF team shadowed by CIA operative Walker played by Henry Cavill (Superman). A lot of the humor comes from this virtual male appendage measuring contest. Cavill is great at this.  Along with regulars Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin, and Simon Pegg, Fallout is an MI:Rogue Nation reunion of sorts with the return of Sean Harris as villain Simon Lane and Rebecca Ferguson as MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. This one has a great feel of the 1960-1970s TV series. MI:F is also a movie post card of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Paris France. The valley in the Kashmir doesn't look too shaby either. Director/co-writer Christopher McQuarrie has made a tight fast paced movie.

This just felt like more of the same...Cue Mission: Impossible Theme, see Tom run, see Tom jump off buildings, see Tom ride a motorcycle(!!!), see Tom suffer horrific violence but recover within seconds.  Then have Simon Pegg put on a Scooby Doo mask and completely con the bad guys!  Make sure the bad guys, you know, the elite syndicate of global assassins, stoop to every movie cliche in the moment of truth and sabotage their own plans.  There should definitely be a scene where one of the good guys has a noose thrown around his neck and is hung up, only to have his partner kick a box to him so he can stand on tiptoes while the fight continues on.  And by all means, set a 15 minute timer on the bomb and let us watch our beloved bomb defusing squad clip wires for 20 minutes.  Way too many played out aspects to this movie to stay invested.

Heck it might actually be one of the best action movies ever.\n\nStory: It's very simple but honestly that is fine. Mission goes bad and could now lead to an even worse event involving nuclear bombs. It's very generic but the journey itself is full of twist and turns that manages to surprise you and keep you hooked\n\nCharacters: Everyone from rogue nation is back (except Jeremy Renner) and it also includes Angela Bassett as the new CIA leader and Henry Cavill as Walker a CIA assassin/agent. All of the returning cast do a great job but props to Ving Rhames as Luther for giving a much different side to him in this film. Henry Cavill is amazing as an counterpart to Tom Cruise Ethan Hunt which makes me feel like the moustache was worth it. Angela Bassett on the other hand was very underutilised in this film which is a shame since she did good with the limited appearance she had. In the film we get to see much more inside the mind of Ethan Hunt and we finally know a lot more about his personality which makes this film feel much more like a personal story which the other Mission Impossible films lack.\n\nMusic: It's by Lorne Balfe so of course it's amazing\n\nAction: Some of the best action scenes in the franchise and of course Tom Cruise does it for real which leads to some great camera shots. The bathroom fight scene with Tom and Henry was amazing with terrific choreography. The HALO dive was shot phenomenally , the motorcycle chase sequence was much more tense compared to the previous one and the helicopter scene in general was amazing. While none of the stunts top that of the Dubai scene in \"Ghost Protocol\" it was still almost as good and there are 3-4 of them in this film.\n\nOverall: This is no doubt one of my favourite movies of this year and is something no one should miss",

And that is where he movie overwhelmingly succeeds. Henry Cavill does a decent job as does the rest of the cast. The score is fun and the plot is fine.

The commitment this guy has to bringing his audience the most spectacular stunts is second to none.  This film is no exception with bone crunching fight scenes and 2 knuckle gnawing chase sequences, one on a motorbike and one in a helicoptor. \nI only took note of this franchise from number 3 onwards when JJ Abrams company Bad Robot took over proceedings.  The first 2 films no longer seem like they are part of the same franchise, the style of both are very different. Number 3 has always been my favourite, Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation were both decent but paled in comparison to 3 which was mostly down to Phillip Seymour Hoffman's excellent bad guy.   Fallout is now probably my second favourite and in some ways the story is linked to number 3 which is maybe why i enjoyed it so much.  The usual supporting cast were good but the one new addition who stood out was Henry Cavill, playing a brutal enforcer for the CIA and Superman really does pack a punch in this one.  Very impressed with this latest addition to the franchise.",

            "content": "My review on Mission Impossible: fallout\n\nStory : Customary action packed plot. Race against time. Finding the missing plutonium explosives. Nothing complicated or head scratching moments, except for few twists and turns that demands attention to the plot.\n\nDirectorial and acting department :\n\nChristopher McQuarrie started off his career as a screen writer , one of his most popular works \"Usual suspects\" which won him an Oscar for best original screenplay. This movie kicked off as a basic 33 pages of seeded script, McQuarrie developed the script along side the production process and he is that capable. There are many characters.But, Would only like to discuss on Ethan hunt aka Tom cruise, Ilsa aka Rebecca Ferguson, Henry Cavill aka August Walker and Julia aka Michelle Monaghan. Ethan's char in this movie has layers, he is dissolved into this game of IMF Vs CIA Vs Rebellious groups, to an extent that he suffers from ambiguity against his own morale, what's right, where's the limit that has to be drawn and the anxiety attacks that he suffers worrying about the one he loves and them being in danger because of the kind of work he's involved in. In short the movie revolves around Ethan's character which is him fighting against the physical world by fighting against his own conscience(here goes redundancy). The love between Ethan and Julia's characters is one of the most matured and well understood relationship I've seen in the recent times of Cinema. Ilsa is nothing but a female Ethan hunt apart from catalysing the plot she serves as a full circle in Ethan's personal life. Henry Cavill? he's just okay a decent foe.\n\nTechnical Aspects :\n\nThe color grading is more saturated in MI series gives that muddy feel.Action scenes are spectacular\nHalo jump(A fuzzy ride), washroom fist fight(uninterrupted Long take and well choreographed ), Bike Chase in Paris here I would like to heed the sound design, especially in this Chase scene Tom cruise rides bike against the traffic you clearly hear the Doppler effect you literally can hear blue shift (compact sound molecules) and red shift (distant sound molecules). And the same effect amplified, when Ilsa cruises through the closed pillared road on bike. Just spectacular and visually satisfying.Even during the Halo jump scene when the lighting strikes the BGM goes mute.\n\nBox Office: \nIt's been 22 years since the first MI movie released (1996), None of the 5 movies grossed $700+ million, The maximum was made by MI:4 $690+ million. Right now the franchise is worth $2.5+ billion. I am guessing this movie will end up making $750-$800 million total in it's whole run at the B.O",

Tom Cruise enjoys these movies and it shows. Henry Cavill (Superman) is very good and does some great stunts. Tome Cruise does his own stunts and you'll see one go wrong and the limp is not acting. Breathless conclusion as is the norm for MI movies. I've liked them all and will go again in a couple of years to see Cruise don't stunts on his walker. Very much recommended.",

The story itself at first seems to be taking the viewer through a maze and we anxiously await gasping twists and turns... but the story seems to come up a bit short as if it couldn't decide where to turn & so just keeps sprinting straight through relying mostly on adrenaline vs. the \"smart, forward thinking, gotcha, control every outcome\" surprises. Those \"gotcha\" moments still exist in the film, but not in satisfying crescendo that we have come to love from MI franchise. Leaving the film to feel more like \"Bourne\" movie than a Miision movie. But maybe MI felt like such \"foolery\" has been thoroughly played out, and the film just wanted to show us Ethan's determination and personal drive is what saves the day. Bottom line: excellent action movie, extremely satisfying and exhilarating, very impressive and admirable fight scenes and stunts. Opting for action adrenaline more than clever suspense & surprise",

I've always found some enjoyment from the Mission: Impossible films, but this one has more roots in its TV show predecessor, it's about teamwork, deceit and subterfuge within subterfuge. What stands out the most, with all Tom Cruise films is not just his performance (I always liked his acting) but the action pieces, they are so good, that they almost hurt and set you on edge with the more extreme stunts. Henry Cavill (and his moustache) are a great addition along with the rest of the usual suspects (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg etc.) This has got to be the best one since the first Mission Impossible.",

Tom Cruise continues his intense run as Ethan Hunt, and allowed to give him some extra shades this time as he starts to question how far he is willing to go to win.  He gets great support from the rest of the cast, with new addition bringing nice physicality and menace as CIA operative, Walker (in a nice twist, Cruise let's Cavill even physically tower over him).  Behind the camera, Christopher McQuarrie crafts a slick, fast-paced thriller with some of the best action sequences of the series, from bathroom fights to the helicopter chase, made all the more brilliant by being done with practical effects, often with Tom Cruise front and center (seriously, this is proof the man is really crazy).  Unfortunately, McQuarrie's attempts to add more levels to the story, from Hunt's guilt over his past actions to how far someone should be willing to go to save the world, never pan out.  It doesn't help most of the twists are predictable (you see the villain a mile away) and when the bad guys are revealed, they aren't that compelling (Sean Harris returns as Solomon Lane, but while still creepy, isn't given much to do).  Overall, still a fun and exciting action movie and one definitely worth seeing in IMAX (spend the extra few bucks if one is available) but still hasn't surpassed \"MI 3\".",

Speaking of the music, it was definitely minimal but effective. The acting was pretty great as well and kept the movie going in the in-between action scenes.

One moment where the hero makes a decision. It wasn't the decision I had a problem with but what happened immediately after that. Hunt makes his decision and then walks away from the car, NO ONE WOULD HAVE DONE THAT!  Secure the package and then make sure that what you knew was the right decision  was actually that. The whole freakin' movie is based on that one second. Not only that but WTF was up with the plot, the scene where Hunt meets up in private with the CIA director felt like a, \"uh, we gotta put this in\" moment after the movie had been screened. And speaking of CIA, I know Angela Bassett can act, but what the hell was that. I didn't feel a word of what she said. It was like I expected her to say, \"just kidding, nah man, i'm just playing.\" after every line. And don't tell me that plot wasn't sort of confusing, the decoy in the bathroom almost killed the guy he was supposedly decoying for. What would have happened if he really did? The whole back end of the movie would have been meaningless. The 15 mins, and if you saw the movie you know what I'm talking about, literally went on for 45 mins real time. The ending was so unlikely it really literally was Mission Impossible. There are so many confusing questions in this movie to me, I am obviously the idiot here because 224 of the 230 experts loved the movie Its certified fresh! What did I like? The White Widow. Venessa Kirby (You've seen her in the Crown as Princess Margaret in The Crown) is a stud up and comer. She plays a perfect villain-love interest.

            "content": "So far, this summer's action and adventure films have been very boring. However, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is far from boring. It's full of adrenaline-pumping action! I believe that this is the best summer action / adventure film of the year and the best Mission Impossible film to date.\n\nIn this film, we see Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) as he receives a mission he chooses to accept, but fails to complete, because of an ambush. As a result, Ethan and his IMF team must work together with the CIA and other familiar allies to stop Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), John Lark (Henry ) and his group, known as the Apostles, from trying to execute a nuclear threat to the world.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about this film are the sound designs, stunts, plot, cast and all the mind-blowing illusions IMF uses to trick the bad guys. I must say, the sound design is fantastic. The audio for explosions and gunshots sound authentic. It sounds so real that I felt as if I was in the scene. The stunts are intense because, if you don't already know, Tom Cruise does all of his stunts. When he performs them, it is hard to watch since he jumps off of many things such as planes and buildings. I felt so nervous that these stunt are real. The stunts are so nerve racking because most of the movie isn't made with CGI's, so most of the stunts are done exactly how the movie shows it. The story is very interesting. I like that you really don't need to see the other films to understand what goes on in this one.\n\nThe cast overall is superb. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are excellent as the IMF, since every delivery is spot on. I like that Benji is the most nervous character and you feel what he feels when a dangerous event happens. Also I enjoyed the performance of Sean Harris, who really brings in the mystery of this character, since he doesn't speak a lot until the end of the film. Rebecca Ferguson, as Ilsa Faust, makes a great curious assassin, since she always goes the opposite way of the IMF and always finds something different and important, which helps the IMF. Also, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin's performances as Erica and Alan are fantastic. I like how their relationship is shown as contradictors, because they both argue their own points. It is a shame we don't get to see more of this in the film. Henry Cavill, as August Walker, is also fantastic. I like how Ethan and August have different ideas about what they should do in the missions and they both try to incorporate their ideas, but those ideas come at a cost.\n\nI really like how each scene feels more intense than the last scene. At one point, I thought that the movie was going to end a certain way and I was so nervous about what was going to happen that I almost fell out of my seat. Finally, what I extremely like about this movie is the tricks the IMF use to trick the bad guys. In certain scenes I was surprised that it was an illusion. My favorite illusion is the masked one where Benji wears a mask that allows him to look like anyone.\n\nThis movie had a lot of great things going for it. The only thing I did not like about it is that it shows way too much in its trailer. However, it is fantastic. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to people who like action / adventure and thriller movies. I recommend it gor ages 13 to 18, as well as adults.\n\nReviewed by Ryan R., KIDS FIRST!

            "content": "Mission Impossible Six. A lot of things are \"falling\" upon us this summer. From Jurassic Park's Fallen Kingdom to Mission Impossible's Fallout.  Good news in this case: The latter is way better than former. You can read my review of the Fallen Kingdom down below. Mission Impossible is one of those series that has somehow managed to not fall apart at the seams despite the many sequels--in much the same manner 007 James Bond films do. Aren't we grateful? Mission Impossible films never seem to disappoint and neither does Fallout. The action, suspense and even some emotional elements are amped up here in Fallout. It is as if the series took a 5-hour energy binge (and you might feel like the movie was 5 hours long, but you won't mind--you'll be glad). My favorite Mission Impossible films are MI:1, MI:3, and Ghost Protocol. It is too early for me tell where this one fits in the running, but it still doesn't beat those three for me. The first film of course is your first love, you cannot deny its charm and its first kiss. You had such great characters played by the likes of John Voigt, Vanessa Redgrave as Max and others. It was superb spy adventure bliss. Mission Impossible 3 was great because of the new additions and great use of the following elements; Simon Peg and Jeremy Renner, the face rendering technology and the amping of action. The humor, high tech and ramping up of action made those two films.\n\n \n\nFallout does not disappoint either. Far from it. There is an uptick with the action, suspense, and twist and turns that keep you wanting you more. I'm not exaggerating. Somehow they managed to do it even if at times they sacrafice believability.  It is on a level that is greater than other films in the series in this regard. When you think you have seen it all, you will find yourself admitting you were wrong. There are some real gasping, nail-biting and jaw dropping scenes too. Fallout director Christopher McQuarrie who directed Rogue Nation is back, and he brings in some elements we aren't used to (references and characters from prior films, and even more encounters with Hunt's estranged wife). These are very pleasant, if not heartwarming surprises that none of the other films have. There are scenes with helicopters and mountain ranges that are memorable in their own right. Who knew you could do all that with a helicopter but you will be wincing more than once.  Nevertheless, there is one small drawback here. All these elements with the increase in action and twists did not leave the film with much room for humor. The humor comes in the second half of the film and fell a bit flat for me. I will admit some others in the theater did laugh out loud but I didn't. Our two adorable modern day Laurel and Hardy agents played by Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are largely absent in the early portion of the film until about the middle. When they are back, their humor is mediocre. Jeremy Renner isn't present at all (he was on the Avenger's Infinity War set). The absence of the three of them in the film is noticeable. We are used to them being there since the start of MI: 3 and as intense as the scenes are, we need their humor and partnership. There is too much high stakes running for the humor to have time to land and when Peg and Rhames do re-arrive, the humor dribbles in here and there. Another small drag on the film is some believability. We all get that this is fiction but the amount of physical running we are supposed to believe Hunt does in this film, with leaping over buildings like Spiderman all the way across town goes way beyond what any of the other films do. When there's a lot of action, we are all too distracted to think about believability. It's easier to suspend belief because we are being \"wow\"'ed. When all we are doing is watching Tom Cruise run through gorgeously filmed landscapes, as cool as the backdrop is, there comes a point where we aren't distracted enough to ignore that no one but a superhero could run that fast, that many miles at full speed and then leap over and through buildings. It edges itself a little over the believability radar when there is not much else happening to distract us.  Excuse the pun, but it appears and feels \"impossible\". However, these two elements are a small nuance.  It doesn't ruin the film nor make it 'impossible' to enjoy, but it doesn't make it the best either. Still, another great installment in a rather lack luster summer season. With dinos for sale at auction and mutant shark named Meg swimming about theater waters, this film is a much-needed thrill and delight. \nThe story starts us on a Mission that ultimately fails to retrieve the intended item because Hunt decides to save one of his crew instead, Luther play by the incomparable Ving Rhames. He is as much a staple to the film as Tom Cruise himself. When things amp up about the failure of Hunt at retrieving three plutonium orbs, Hunt takes things into his own hands once again while the CIA questions his loyalty and motives. Thus, soon Hunt is being hunted and watched by the CIA through Agent August Walker, played by the mouth watering Henry Cavill.  Despite saving his life, August clearly has other motives that aren't seen readily.  Meanwhile, Hunt is on a chase for an old enemy from Rogue Nation, Solomon Lane. August Walker and the CIA have their own interest in Lane as well. Lane is an ex-operative who became an anarchist, imprisoned and tossed around from government to government. Since the last film, Lane is somehow hoping and manipulating things to happen so that Hunt is forced to get his hands on him. Hunt hopes by capturing Lane that he can stop a new league of terrorists called The Apostles who Lane has spearheaded. However, Lane is blinded by an apocalyptic ending for himself and Hunt. The Apostles just merely want to end the world system through nuclear explosions. Pick your poison? Hunt has to deal with them both if he wants to save the world. It's a triad of dangers when you throw in the CIA which intersects Ethan Hunt everywhere he goes. Hunt and his team are on a race against time to prevent a global catastrophe, but they get far more than bargained for in this one. This mission once again tests them all to the limit. Yes, even further than we have seen before in the series so far.\n\nSee a further breakdown at my website GotWords.org",

            "content": "There's an old joke, first said about the original Mission: Impossible TV series which asks how we can continue to describe the tasks undertaken by these heroes as 'impossible' if they manage to successfully complete them week after week. This question is even more applicable to the barely connected film series of the same name where the stakes keep getting raised, the odds ever more unlikely, and the risks taken even more ludicrous with every release. With each film, the 'Mission: Impossible' part of each instalment's title seems to refer less to the adventure that the characters go on than it does to the challenge of finding a danger great enough to trouble our protagonist, Ethan Hunt. There's a famously impossible philosophical question which asks what would happen if an unstoppable force was to run straight into an immovable object. At times the Mission: Impossible movie series feels like an endless futile search for an obstacle big enough to finally stop, or even slow down, the unstoppable force that is Tom Cruise.\n\nCruise is something of a contradiction. Since he first appeared on screen as a young man, his good looks, natural charm and intense charisma made him in instantly recognisable on-screen presence. By the time of the first Mission: Impossible movie, back in 1996, it felt almost as if he was perfectly designed in a factory somewhere for the sole purpose of being the flawless example of a modern day 'movie star.' However, in the years which followed, that metaphor felt a little too accurate as Cruise's onscreen 'perfection' started to feel somewhat artificial. As Cruise aged, his incandescent confidence ceased to be merely the cocksure attitude of youth and increasingly started to feel more like the vainglorious assuredness of religious fervour. (It's no coincidence that this perception began to take hold around the same time as Cruise's involvement in the Church of Scientology started to become a subject of public discourse.) He is still, obviously, a major star and commands the screen powerfully, but his attempts to continue playing loveable, everyman heroes increasingly fall flat while many of his best roles have been morally questionable supporting parts, if not outright villains (think Interview With The Vampire, Magnolia, Collateral, hell even Tropic Thunder). Directors of major action blockbusters aren't always sure exactly what to do with Cruise (the Mission: Impossible series alone has changed director, along with tone and style, no less than five times across six movies so far). However, the Mission: Impossible films have started to become increasingly beloved by critics and audiences. Despite varying wildly in their casts, plotting and the way in which they are executed, the Mission: Impossible films are all united in their fascination with the legend of Ethan Hunt. Often mistaken for a characterless cypher, Hunt is (as Alec Baldwin calls him in 2015 'Rogue Nation') the living manifestation of destiny. Hunt is a force of nature. Hunt is a fucking madman. But he's our madman. The trailers shouldn't say 'Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt' because that would be redundant. Ethan Hunt is Tom Cruise.\n\nAnd Cruise, as expected, gives everything to the role. The stunts in Mission: Impossible - Fallout are simply unbelievable. Cruise famously broke his ankle during production while jumping between rooftops (and completed filming the scene before getting medical help) but by the time that death defying stunt actually appears on screen it feels like a fairly regular, everyday occurrence compared to the utterly insane risks already taken in earlier (and later) scenes. It's not just surprising that Cruise managed to avoid injuring himself worse, it's simply staggering that he is still walking around, and breathing, after production on all this mayhem wrapped. The most jaw-dropping of these involves Hunt partaking in a HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) parachute jump to arrive covertly at a heavily guarded event. All credit must be given to (Camera Operator) Craig O'Brien, who had to to not only follow Cruise all the way to the ground, but keep him in perfect focus the whole time while careening towards the Earth at 180mph from the cruising height of a 747. The audience should be given oxygen canisters too just to keep them breathing while watching it.\n\nDespite being the longest, and probably the most convoluted, in the franchise, it would be an understatement to say that Mission: Impossible - Fallout moves fast. Having already established most of it's main cast and their relationships in the previous movies, it barrels straight into action, stacking set pieces on top of each other and constantly moving forward at breakneck speed. There's also a certain confidence to the directing on show which no doubt comes from Christopher McQuarrie becoming the first director to helm a second movie in this series. Everything about this film is trying to be bigger, bolder and braver than it's predecessors. (Case in point, Fallout is not just the only film in the series to feature dream sequences but has Hunt vaporised by a nuclear blast, Terminator 2 style, in one of them.) Much like the fun, if more lowbrow, Fast and The Furious series, the Mission: Impossible films took until their fourth chapter to really feel like they'd found a voice they were comfortable with. McQuarrie clearly understands how to deliver it exactly as audiences expect. If there is a flaw to this it's that the lack of a new hand at the wheel has prevented the film from having anything resembling a unique style or character of it's own. Mission: Impossible - Fallout feels much more like a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation than a mere installment in a larger series. Almost all of the main cast of that film return and this one resembles it in plot, character, theme and style. Apart from featuring a final sequence that combines explosive spectacle with ticking clock tension better than any of the previous climaxes, the biggest difference between Mission: Impossible - Fallout and it's immediate predecessor is that it doesn't have as many moments of lighthearted humour to balance the constant gloomy shadow of shady espionage and doom-laden terrorism.\n\nDespite the twisty narrative: full of betrayals, warring agencies and double crosses; there are no real surprises here and most of the major reveals are more likely to inspire shrugs than gasps. There are nods to each of the previous films in the series though, and there is a sense in both of McQuarrie's releases that he is using these films to try and reconcile the first four movies (which often feel like they could come from parallel dimensions to each other) into one coherent timeline.\n\nSo what is new? Vanessa Kirby appears as a secretive arms dealer known as the White Widow, a kind of younger, sexier update to Vanessa Redgrave's 'Max' from the first movie. Angela Bassett plays Erica Sloane, the head of the CIA, becoming the latest great actor to bring extra gravitas to the series by playing a disapproving authority figure. But the new cast member who has gained the most press is Henry Cavill. He plays August Walker, a CIA assassin tasked with keeping tabs on Ethan and his team to prevent them from yet again going rogue in the line of duty. Cavill is yet to convincingly display the kind of onscreen personality required for roles like Superman (which he plays for the DC Extended Universe) but here he is mostly tasked with appearing like a massive human brick wall with a moustache. At that, he is perfect. He towers over most of the cast and he somehow appears to reload his arms before charging at opponents like a solid iron battering ram. Also, it is a luxurious moustache.\n\nThe violence in the film is one of it's strong points. The fight scenes are the best of the series so far and each punch or kick has solid weight behind it and lands with a visceral crunch. However, up until the film's (frankly brilliant) final chase/fight/bomb diffusion sequence, there isn't that much sense of real human peril. Sure, the action sequences are excellent, shot with clarity and vision and keep you on the edge of your seat with ingenious reversals of fortune. However, although you are often left wondering how the characters could possibly get out of their predicament, you never really feel that, this time, they simply might not. And that, ultimately, is the film's biggest weakness. There's a running joke throughout the film where character's are asked what their plan is and they can only reply \"We're working on it\" suggesting that they are simply winging things half the time and hoping that luck will carry them to safety. (By this point Ethan Hunt resembles the bumbling, overconfident, parody spy Sterling Archer as much as he resembles the suave James Bond type.) Unfortunately their confidence is contagious, leaving you with a certainty that things will somehow work out in the end.\n\nLike it's lead characters, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is running at full tilt, creating startlingly smart and confident solutions as it goes. It's a ballsy, efficient and powerful piece of action filmmaking that understands how to build character and forward plot while on the move. It supplies truly outstanding white-knuckle thrills and just enough spy intrigue to keep things interesting in the downtime. However, it still can't quite complete the impossible mission of making you truly emotionally connect with these characters enough to fear deeply for their safety.\n\nFrom MOGULAMANIA:\nhttps://mogulamania.blogspot.com/2018/07/new-release-review-mission-impossible.html",

Tom Cruise gives the a more emotional performance as we see that he is not perfect and how throughout the movie he is making mistakes, to show he is flawed.

            "content": "Mission Impossible: Fallout (5 out of 5 stars). Mission Impossible: Fallout is an awesome, exciting action packed sequel that shows Tom Cruise is up for more crazy stunts. From jumping out of an HALO plane, being chased on a motorcycle in Paris, running and jumping on rooftops in London, and flying an helicopter and being caught in a dogfight. These movies get better through sequels and I am not complaining that they should stop. Each movie gets better and tops the one before. Fallout is probably the best one out of six movies now. Sure, I find Tom Cruise climbing the burj khalifa to be the most intense stunt and the motorcycle chase scene in Rogue Nation to be well done and the best action sequence. Fallout in general has a lot going for it. From a plot that has a lot of pieces moving with characters betraying another. Double and triple crosses with each other. But it all makes sense in the end when everything is pieced together. The plot follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luthor (Ving Rhames) are on a mission trying to retrieve stolen nuclear devices. When the mission goes awry and Ethan has to face the consequences of saving ones life over millions. They are forced to have a shadow from the CIA with August Walker (Henry Cavill) tagging along with them on there missions. While a terrorist group called The Apostles are after the nuclear devices. A lot more goes on with the plot which makes it better. But the less you know before going to see it, the better. There are a few twists that will surprise you. Characters wearing masks and fooling the audience that will leave you surprised. And a few triple crosses. Yes, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns with her own agenda that may interfere with Hunt's mission. The movie is loaded with action packed set pieces throughout. I will consider this to be the best action movie of the year so far. Definitely, a summer blockbuster type of movie while it is keeping you thinking and focused on its heavy-handed plot. Writer/Director Christopher McQuarrie does well with topping each action scene over the one before that. From a HALO jump scene that is dizzying and crazy. To a brutal fight scene in the bathroom at a club. To a convoy breakout that leads Ethan being chased by the police with more bad guys after him while Faust is hot on his trail as well. To an overlong rooftop running scene that shows Tom Cruise can jump and sprint for long distances. Then, the climatic finale with Tom Cruise being in an aerial combat dogfight while flying a helicopter which is dizzying and thrilling but the best aerial combat scene shot on film. Tom Cruise is at his best again. Henry Cavill is a great addition as well playing a character that is hard to trust. Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are still good. Pegg having more hands on action this time. Rebecca Ferguson is great playing a character that is difficult on trusting but has feelings for Ethan while they have different agendas on their mission. Sean Harris returns with that monotone voice but is still menacing. Alec Baldwin was great too with having more confidence in Ethan's actions and choices even though he does not show it. The music score Lorne Balfe was also good and helped create the tone of the movie which is a bit darker. His score almost sounds similar to Hans Zimmer. Overall, Mission Impossible Fallout is a great film. If you are into the series or not. This film will definitely win newcomers. The action sequences are top notch exciting and thrilling. There is a lot of action from beginning to end. The cast is great. The plot is all over the place but works well with the twist and turns. Tom Cruise is not holding back with stunts. This 2 and half hour film does feel short when the pace flies so fast with its busy plot and non stop action. You may finally catch a breath when it is over.",

            "content": "Mission: Impossible is a franchise that, much like its protagonist Ethan Hunt, just doesn't quit. While the first three entries in the film series ranged from \"alright\" to \"pretty meh,\" the most recent three films have set new high bars for action films and have exhibited some of the most impressive stunts ever done for a movie. Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation are two of my favorite films and have showcased Tom Cruise at his best and most daring. Fallout continues this trend. You would think that a franchise that is six films in would have started to slow down, but Mission: Impossible has impossibly kept the momentum and excitement with its most recent entry.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout features the same actors and characters that have become familiar to fans of the series. Tom Cruise is of course back as Ethan Hunt, the skilled and seasoned agent of IMF (Impossible Mission Force) who has prevented world-changing disasters more times than he probably ever wanted to. Cruise is somehow still at the top of his game in Fallout, and it's hard not to respect the man for the dedication he gives to his craft. As per usual, the insane stunts that you see Hunt perform in the film are done by Cruise himself, and this is something that continues to bolster the film's already-incredible action. Shots of Cruise piloting a helicopter through mountains, jumping from a C17, or leaping across buildings look completely real because they ARE completely real. Even though he's getting old (56 years old as of July 2018), I hope he continues to do what he does for just a few more years.\n\nCruise is joined by many of the franchise's recurring favorite characters. Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell, who is finally given more to do in the film and serves as a permanent member of the IMF team of agents rather than as a brief cameo or supporting role. Simon Pegg is back as Benji Dunn, another IMF agent, and Pegg does an excellent job again even though the writing dials back the character's humor this time around. Rebecca Ferguson continues her role as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent and love interest (?) of Hunt's, and she delivers another convincing performance. Henry Cavill joins the cast of Fallout as well, portraying a tough and burly CIA assassin who is tasked by the CIA's director (Angela Bassett) to supervise the IMF team. Every performance in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is superb, and no one (except for Cruise) really outshines the others. This is especially important when considering the team dynamic in the film, something that Ghost Protocol in particular nailed on the head. Everyone on the IMF team feels as capable as the rest, and each contributes their own unique skills and personality that make them compelling and worthy additions to the team.\n\nNow let's get into the meat of the film: the action. The Mission: Impossible franchise has always been about the high-stakes, edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting action. This is something that Fallout doubles down on, and I can confidently say that it features the best action of the franchise. I'll even venture to say that it features some of the best action of all time. Its hand-to-hand combat sequences are brutal: the edits and camera angles bring out the force of every punch, kick, jab, and block, and the fight choreography is directed beautifully. Vehicular chase scenes are filmed in a way that you never lose track of where characters are in relation to each other and the landscape feels familiar and easy to follow. Gunfights are intense and made powerful by the sound editing and cuts. The action is simply marvelous to behold and assembled masterfully by a director, Christopher McQuarrie, who proves that he has harnessed his craft. These scenes, which are memorable to say the least, have been replaying in my head over and over since I walked out of the theater, giving me the urge to watch the film again.\n\nAside from the film's stellar action, the other aspects of Mission: Impossible - Fallout are great as well. The writing is superb. It fills the plot with twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat (and probably confuse you a bit). It adds development to characters in ways that you wouldn't expect from an action film. It also makes the most ridiculous things seem plausible and believable in the film's context, something I cannot elaborate on without spoiling things. The acting, as I already mentioned, is top-notch, and the entire cast contributes greatly to the movie. The cinematography is excellent as well: beautiful wide shots of cities, mountains, and landscapes are present throughout, and the camerawork during the film's most gut-wrenching moments enhances the intensity and emotion.\n\nCan I name any flaws with Mission: Impossible - Fallout? I have one, single flaw that comprises a single second of the film. There is a single shot of computer-generated rocks tumbling over the edge of a cliff, and this shot looked really bad, like something out of a 1980s video game.\n\nThat's it. The only real flaw with Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a second-long, unfinished CGI shot. You could argue that the film's twists and turns that I mentioned could be too much or be too confusing, but that is purely a preferential issue with the film and one that did not affect me. One could also point out the clich\u00e9d last-second resolutions that happen a few times and the deus ex machina that is scattered throughout, but I honestly thought these were handled so well in the script that they were not a problem at all.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout is the rare action film that is smartly written, beautifully directed, well-acted, memorable, and an absolute joy to watch. This is the first film I have seen all summer that I've loved and had no significant issues with. Without a doubt it is the best film in the franchise and one of the best action films I have ever seen, and I have every intention of seeing it again, buying it on Blu-Ray, and convincing as many people as possible to see it. This is a franchise that I hope continues to pump out excellent films as long as Tom Cruise is willing to work on them. Rest assured that you will find me in line to see it on its opening night whenever it is released. Mission: Impossible - Fallout gets 5 out of 5 stars.",

Though I think Christopher McQuarrie has seem the 1993 Sylvester Stallone movie \"Cliffhanger\" because I saw some similarities in this movie's climax that reminded me of Stallone's action thriller.  I was never bored despite the two hour plus running time.  However there was one liability here:  Henry Cavill.  He just did not work for me in his role as CIA operative August Walker.  Also plottwists that were supposed to surprise the audience can be seen from a mile away.  Still I liked this movie enough to recommend it.

Now when it comes to the Mission Impossible series the odd numbered movies have always been great, the even numbered ones not so much (Still wish I could erase MI2 out of existence). I'm happy to say that Fallout has broken the streak of bad even numbered MI movies.\nNow thats not to say its one of the best. The movie DID NOT have to be TWO AND A HALF HOURS LONG. I really wish they had trimmed it down and made it tighter. Fallout is basically a follow up to the last MI movie (which is by far my favorite). Sadly even though it had the same director, given its heavy run time, the movie frequently stalls between action set pieces. Some action sequences go on to long, especially the one at the end which from a story perspective is just damn silly.\nStill its a fun movie, worth the $15 (not $20 in IMAX). It is not just a mindless popcorn flick. What lets me down is that everything was there to make it one of the better Mission Impossibles, its just so bloated that the good stuff gets lost in unnecessary excessiveness. They REALLY needed an editor with more of a backbone.\nMy MI movies from best to worst:\nMI: Rogue Nation\nMI:3\nMission Impossible\nMI: Fallout\nMI: Ghost Protocol\n(MI: 2 would be at the bottom but I still choose to believe it doesn't exist.)",

            "content": "Whether you personally believe in this notion or not, the Mission: Impossible franchise has been on an upward trajectory for years. With the release of the first film entertaining action fans and Tom Cruise fans alike, it was inevitable that a sequel would be made. Personally, I think the second film easily could have sunk this franchise easily. Mission: Impossible 3 revitalized the franchise in terms of character and story and the rest is history. In terms of critical reception and fan appeal, this franchise is better than it has ever been. Mission: Impossible - Fallout has just hit the big screen and I would be lying to myself if I didn't give in and say this may be my favourite of the entire franchise. I know that's a bold statement, due to the fact that the previous two films were fantastic, but let's dive in.\n\nPicking up a couple of years after the events of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, this is the first film in the franchise to directly continue a storyline from movie to movie. I was slightly wary of this notion, but I believe it worked very well. Following Ethan Hunt and his team after a failed mission, this team seeks out three orbs of plutonium, to prevent further, global catastrophe. While it seems like these are the MacGuffins of the story, Solomon Lane (the previous villain) also becomes a MacGuffin for the team, as he stirs up more trouble for them along the way. This is a very complex movie at times, which leads me to my only real complaint.\n\nAlthough this isn't technically a negative, because they pay everything off in a very nice way throughout the third act, it does feel like there is a little too much going on at times. The reason I don't find any of these movies absolutely perfect is due to the fact that they choose to be overly complex in their execution of certain storylines. From world-ending possibilities, to double-crosses, to bringing back previous storylines from past movies, and even to relying on an emotional core to the film that some viewers may not latch onto if they haven't seen the other movie, it can be quite the task of a movie to sit through. That being said, I'm a huge fan of this franchise and I was able to follow everything quite easily, so I think the execution of my possible, aforementioned complaints are only an issue if you haven't seen its predecessors.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout almost seems like a culmination of everything since the third movie and the action is just the icing on the cake. Although slightly ridiculous at times (which of these films isn't though), the action throughout this film is some of the best that this franchise has ever seen (in my opinion). From the hand-to-hand combat to the aerial chases, to the terrifically daring stunts, this is a sequel that doesn't pull any punches and satisfies in both storytelling and pure, adrenaline-fuelled excitement. At a pretty lengthy 147 minutes, I never once felt bored. That's probably due to the fact that I loved a lot more than just what was on its surface.\n\nChristopher McQuarrie returns from the previous film to direct and although each film has a history of switching directors, I believe he did a job worthy of continuing from the previous instalment. He, along with superb cinematography by Rob Hardy and a surprisingly fresh sounding score by Lorne Balfe, everything about my experience of this film was nothing short being utterly impressed. It's not very often that I find myself praising a movie for being near perfect on a technical level, as well as story and action, but Mission: Impossible - Fallout did it for me.\n\nIn the end, Mission: Impossible - Fallout at least deserves to be in the discussion for best of the franchise, even if you personally don't agree. If you can allow yourself to be completely immersed in a movie for nearly two and half hours, then I believe this may be one of the better moviegoing experience you'll have at the theatre this year. Aside from feeling a little too complex at times, there are many arcs that come full circle and I felt incredibly satisfied. Mission: Impossible - Fallout may not be an Oscar-contender, but I had an absolute blast with it and it's surely going to be included with some of my favourites of 2018.",

Rebecca Ferguson smolders, Vanessa Kirby fascinates, and Simon Pegg pushes for more than sidekick. Henry Cavill is solid and complicated. Hot fun!",

            "content": "I just want to put this out there:\n\nCRUISE + McQUARRIE = Match made in Action packed Heaven \n\nThe Mission Impossible movie series feels a lot like the Fast and furious (and I know its a strange connection) but with each movie it seems to find its footing and place and when it does it gets better and better and crazier with each movie and with this Latest Mission: Impossible Fallout this once again solitifies Tom Cruise as a beast when it comes to stunts and top notch action.....don't forget the running cause there's a lot of that too. The story provides just enough twist and turns to keep you occupied as well as putting you at the edge of your seat....only two mission: Impossible movies have done that in years and it wasn't M:I 2 (that crappy ass movie)!\n\nThe Story comes after the events of \"Rouge Nation\" where what's left of 'The Syndicate' is trying to find peace though chaos by stealing three nuclear cores and once again Ethan hunt (Tom Cruise) and the rest of his IMF team must go on a globe trotting adventure to stop a newly formed rouge nation from causing devastation on a massive scale; The story is something we have heard of before in any other typical spy thriller. But without spoiling anything the fun and the twists that come from this feels close and pays some homage to the series as well as the first movie without going overboard. In fact, It feels like throughout this movie that they take alot of elements from every Mission:Impossible movie here and there just to add on to the fun and the way the director and writers add these features its a beautiful mix worth watching.  \n\nI love how each character gets their time to shine more in this movie than any other M:I films well 1, 3, somewhat 4 and 5. I'm a big fan for Luther (Vhig Rhames) and I felt his character is under-utilized in at least 2 of these said movies and I was glad that he get's a much bigger role in this movie and in fact he feels moreso like the heart of the group the one that knows Ethan more than anyone being that he's been around him for years and both trust each other with their lives and i felt it showed much more in this more than a film like M:I 2, the Dynamic of the team is every bit as great than in any other film previous and you see how loyal they are to Ethan as Ethan is every bit as loyal to them and that's the human aspect which works so well in this movie cause at the end of the day its not always about Tom Cruise its about him and his team that works with him. Henry Cavill's Character of Walker was that 'Hammer\" the person who would do whatever it takes to stop the weapon and the fight scenes OMG the action sequences; I saw this in IMAX so the punches felt/Sounded Brutal and the action sequences like i said before proves that Tom is rising up there next to Jackie Chan in providing the best by doing his own stunt work; for a man pushing 50 he got what it takes to get a movie done right....now I can argue that Henry should have kept that beard for 'Justice League\" but that's neither here nor there! \n\nSo where's the flaw.....well 1) This movie should have been longer...lmao I wanted more I wanted more intensity that this movie put out. you had moments to take a breath and then the action kicked it...gives you a brief moment rest again and then ACTION OVERDRIVE and it was so good...it worked for every scene and it puts a sense of humanity Ethan's character cause you know he's not superhuman but he cares about the lives that he's willing to do what he can to save them. 2nd flaw....the final climax did feel a bit wash, rinse, repeat of itself....it felt like something you've already seen before and while this movie did a good job with the climax i couldn't help but to say to myself in the theater, \"you know how this will end\" and of course it ended that way so that was pretty much it. \n\nOverall, i will go as far and say this is the best in the series hands down!! \nwhile I do love the first movie and M:I 3 was mediocre but fun to say the least and the Ghost protocol and Rouge nation were the most fun; 'Fallout' pretty much says, \"hold my beer\" to its own franchise, Its fun, smart, intense, and while it falls into predictable territory towards the last act it still kept me wanting more from this movie. And with that I'm going to go see it again cause its damn worth it!!\n\n5/5 Stars\nI will add one more star for Tom Cruise doing his own DAMN STUNTS its amazing!! \nAnd another star for actually using the footage from that infamous rooftop scene of him limping that was really ballsy.......I LOVED it!!  \n\nBlack Guy that reviews movies...",

Yes, Cruise is back as spymaster Ethan Hunt in this sixth installment in the Mission Impossible franchise, this time leading his IMF team on a joint mission with a CIA assassin (Henry Cavill) to stop a terrorist group from launching a nuclear attack aimed at destroying a third of the world's population. This sequel has all the clich\u00e9d dialogue, contrived spy vs. spy cloak and dagger melodrama, and ridiculously over the top action sequences we've come to expect from the franchise over the years. And then there are the car chases. And foot chases. And helicopter chases. And probably other chases that we can't recall due to the pulse-pounding, mind-numbing sensory overload of action, that while entertaining, fails to mask a laughably silly, convoluted storyline that takes itself way too seriously. Cavill, however, is a nice, fresh addition to the film, as is the super charismatic Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in Netflix's The Crown) as the sarcastic, knife-wielding White Widow. In all, a fun, albeit mindless, film that will likely self-destruct from your memory five seconds after leaving the theater. B- \u2014\u2014\u2014- TheReelness.com",

            "content": "As we all know, this is the sixth instalment of the franchise. Supposedly by this time, the series already started long to drag their wear and tear tires here and about, so within so without, sucking every preposterous and ridiculous ideas they can think of. However, Mission Impossible franchise has been one of the few to deny that statement, as the impossible becomes possible, as it suggests that statement is merely a myth, as the ideas never entirely run out, as the stunts are afresh and eye-catching but can this new instalment keep up with the others (putting aside the second one as if it never happens because the majority of us can agree it's the worst) or will it have a serious fallout?\n\nOne thing to talk about is the plot. It is superficially heavy this time, in fact the heaviest out of all the series. Plus, it is intertwined and ultra-complicated for a summer Hollywood movie that you will be exhausted after the 147 mins ride. What makes this successful is that it has that Oscar-worthy vibe and it solves the puzzles very neatly towards the end despite some revelations might come off as predictable. And before I forget to mention, this movie has a lot of deep connections with Rogue Nation (the 5th instalment). Watch the previous instalment before stepping into this new mission or you will hardly relate with the characters. And if you've had the time, revise the 3rd one too.\n\nNow, you must promptly be wondering, how about the stunts? Let me get to this part. THE... STUNTS... ARE... REAL! Every time you go in watching this best ongoing franchise in the world, you should bear in mind that CGI is a non-existent element. And the stunts are performed by Tom Cruise himself. The daring set pieces are well choreographed and acted in a way that looks real and genuine that puts most of this year's other action blockbuster movies to shame. The BATHROOM scene... will leave you in total shock. The PARIS scene... will make you gasp due to many unexpected moments... The ROOFTOP scene... will make you wonder which one that got Tom Cruise injured... The KASHMIR scene... will make your heart jitters and probably, pees in your pants because... THE STUNTS ARE ALL REAL!\n\nActing is well done, of course. Henry Cavill savors his swashbuckler swagness, Simon Pegg brings less comedy to the table but executes a more matured lad, Rebecca Ferguson has improved a lot since her debut in Rogue Nation, and she has lost a lot of weight that perfectly suits her role, Michelle Monaghan makes us miss her character so much and eventually, fall in love with her and Tom Cruise is anything good you can possible talk about. He is a legend!\n\nWhat I like is it plays a bit different this time in which there is less over-the-top artificial techs and more to realistic stunts that put the gadgets to rest this time. This is a classified mission where nothing is impossible in reality but it is impossible to commit because of how dangerous and menacing there are. \n\nThey opt on breathtaking locations as they fill with richness and intensity making the movie charges with a load of energy that transmits to the audience who becomes alive and fully realizes that this is the exact location without any usage of CGI.\n\nWhen the action scenes come in especially the Paris scene, the sound effect is top-notch; you can hear those tiny details of engineered sound system waving in the cinema hall, sucking the audience as if we are in the action movie ourselves.\n\nWhat I dislike is the repetitive dialogues by Tom Cruise, it is semi-cool and semi-irritating because he keeps saying the same phrases at every different location. It comes off as irritating but why is it cool is because sometimes, it uses the third-act solution technique in creating a storyline... and humor apparently.\n\nAnother thing I dislike is the scene when the theme song emerges on the big screen. Don't get me wrong... I love and salute the theme song. However, I hate it when it shows glimpses of scenes and stunts that about to happen afterwards followed by its chronological order. In my opinion, that is a big spoiler!\n\nAnd I dislike that they fail to tell Jeremy Renner's character whereabouts after Rogue Nation (as far as I can remember).\n\nTruth to be told, I wasn't a huge fan of the Mission Impossible series until... three months before this movie came out. I felt a whole energy down my spine and knew this is going to be a good one. Bloody hell! How wrong was I! It isn't just good, it is state-of-the-art masterpiece action blockbuster film.\n\nSo if I'm going to rank all the six impossible-made films, it would be: (From Best to Worst)\n\n6, 4, 3, 5, 1 and 2.\n\nIs there any hope for this franchise to survive in Hollywood? VERY POSSIBLE! Is there any story left that this franchise can get hold onto for the next instalment? POSSIBLE! Is there any chance you might doze off during the movie at any condition? IMPOSSIBLE! Is there any chance left that the stunts can get any better than Fallout? VERY IMPOSSIBLE!\n\nYour mission... should you choose to accept it is to see Mission Impossible: Fallout in theaters!\n\nOverall: 90/100\n\nThis message will self-destruct in 5 seconds...",

Not only is this mission possible, it is downright probable despite what any sort of contrived plot parameter demands it not be. Like any of the previous installments in this beloved action espionage franchise offer, we are treated to two and a half hours of nonstop setup and payoff. Double agents defy orders, single agents defy borders, hot triple agent action occurs in a bathroom stall for the Frenchmen to earnestly catcall, and the badman tries to nuke civilization for the Nth time. Despite how silly all of the dialogue is and despite how undercut the spy film tropes are for the sake of staying fresh, this is an awesome return to form for modern American action cinema.\n\nYou could sit there in your big boy chair tearing apart the screenplay like you rend your fried chicken tender flesh from its amalgamate finger form, but you would be doing yourself a disservice. Henry Cavill sacrificed his mustache credibility for this role, and damn you if you cant appreciate what he did it for. From the cold and deceptively prolonged opening sequence, to the first plot point where Ethan Hunt has to decide if he will defy utilitarianism, to the second plot point where Ethan Hunt has to decide that he WILL defy utilitarianism, we are ensured all sorts of daunting nuclear moral conundrums. But don't worry, he's such a stand up guy that not only will he choose his friends over his accepted mission or responsibility to ensuring the safety of millions but he'll sacrifice a crap ton of efficient use of screen time for a really awesome extended set piece. And let's face it, that's what we came here for.\n\nAnything you have heard about the action in this film is not overstated. I'll admit, there's a bit too much teal/amber for my taste in the cinematography, but the movie is damned beautiful (bar the editing of the scene in the club with White Widow - that kind of cut contrast is just gross looking). The action sequences are what justify this mainstream approach. After all, how else could you unify sky jumping through a thunderstorm, traffic chases through Paris, fist fights in a rave bathroom, and helicopteraphying the peaks of Kashmir? Doesn't matter, action man punched and shot his way out of authoritarian disillusionment and saved all of the plebs to spite them. Thank Xenu for Sweet Baby Action Christ: Tom Cruise.",

And while the the story is beautifully designed, something in the fun and heart of the series has been lost since \"Ghost Protocol.\"  Brad Bird's presence injected the franchise with a much needed dose of imagination--we saw cool gadgets, great gags, and very imaginative set pieces that raised the bar for Cruise and company.  But since Christopher McQuarrie has taken the helm, we have been treated to beautiful imagery and stunts that don't fully cohere.  There are pacing issues in both \"Rogue Nation\" and \"Fallout,\" action sequences that seem to end on a flat note and, yet, want you to interpret flatness as nothing less than cleverness.  There are moments where the sequences in \"Fallout\" seem to reach a state of transcendence for action cinema, until you realize that the scenes are not in fact transcending anything you haven't seen before; instead, they are allowing those moments to play longer than normal.   For me, the central flaw of this fiilm was returning to a villain we have seen before--in that, \"Fallout\" plays like the typical \"sequel\" that would have played in the 80s: Same characters, same general moments, slightly different plot.  In fact, one can almost replace \"Rogue Nation\" with \"Fallout\" and the franchise would be much better off for it.   As an ardent fan of \"The Mission Impossible\" film and television series, I always look forward to another movie installment.  There is so much satisfaction in character of Ethan Hunt to keep me coming back for more, even when the emotional engagement is contrived and artificial.  I hope the series returns to the type of balance of plot , gadgetry, and imagination that we saw in \"Ghost Protocol.\"   Otherwise, I'm not interested in seeing another mission crafted by McQuarrie.",

However, the recent joining of director and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie to the Mission Impossible production, has sent this franchise through the roof. With each action sequence you believe Cruise more and more, it is safe to say now that Tom Cruise has truly become Ethan Hunt. The film is sensory euphoria with a core rooted in what we all want realism to be. McQuarries screenplay is filled with plot twists and deception to the viewer that could be perceived as cheesy but it is hard not to get caught up in this film. You will want it to take you for a ride to what every spy/thriller movie strives to be.",

I've only seen was Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, and that's it. Along with this one, so it's my second movie for me. I need to see all of them in order to know what's really going on with the other plots to them. Rogue Nation is what got me interested in these series and I absolutely love them. Tom Cruise is a beast and he is such a great stuntman. I love the fact how the action sequences looked so practical, and there was hardly any use of CGI most of the time. like maybe 85-90% was real, while 10-15% was very little CGI. Even though they used a little bit of CGI, it wasn't that noticeable in any way since it already looked realistic. I enjoyed the heck out of this awesome movie. Tom Cruise still has it and wow, it's a miracle that he didn't fail the stunts, except with the one part on the rooftop where he was running and jumped off the edge of the ledge on a platform and bruised his ankle. That was insane how they kept that shot in the movie. That's why it does makes this movie look better and realistic because he actually did hurt himself while he was filming, and it proves that he's the man to do it and doesn't hesitate to do so. He doesn't mind taking any risks in his life. A very brave man I'm telling you. This was so amazing, and thrilling, and maybe is a better improvement from the others. It will have you off the edge of your seat and hell that was an awesome experience especially seeing it in 3D. Everything about it was great!!! Loved it!!",

The acting was great with a few powerful moments, but nothing that raises it to a +++ on its own. The innovation in Tom Cruise's stunt work is why the acting rating is rightfully brought up. The writing wasn't perfect but had good dialogue with an easy to follow story and minimal plot holes. There were some issues with pacing toward the beginning and maybe a few missteps in the middle, but in the end, managed to flow very well, which definitely serves its purpose in maintaining its suspense. Sound design and soundtrack are as great as ever, except for some music being a little too noticeable at times, making parts seem cheesy when they're taking the serious route.\nAll in all, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is beautiful, well acted and an intense and immensely enjoyable ride. This is a must-see.\n\nWanna see where it landed on my 2018 top movies list? Go here: https://letterboxd.com/willtemkin/list/2018-reviews-ranked",

But this is where, McQuarrie; the writer-director, comes in and smartly makes it all glorifying for the audience to chew in the character's perspective easily. \n\nIt is rich on technical aspects like breathtaking camera work, stunning production design and alluring visuals. Addition to that, the choreography of all the chase or action sequences is so finely detailed and lethally performed that leaves the audience in an awe of it. \n\nWith all the buzz of the cast performing their own stunts; especially by Cruise, after a certain point, seems essential to get the audience enchanted into it and calculate the magnitude of the stakes projected in here and connect instantly. \n\nThe only two reason why the feature fails to enter the major league would be its lack of creativity on the concept and the poetic theme that seems to be the missing puzzle in here. Cruise is confident, mature and has evolved a lot on portraying the character where he may be vulnerable but not weak. \n\nPegg, Cavill, Ferguson and Rhames gets their own stand out moments which they hold on to it decently. Live Locations, exhilarating stunts, throat-slicing politics and Cruise at the heart of it are the high points of this feature that unflinchingly delivers. \n\nMission Impossible : Fallout is an exuberant extravaganza that plays with its audience like a mere 4 year old kid and the wise thing would be to nod along.",

Ving Rhames's talent and screen magnetism is especially wasted in service to this. Alec Baldwin isn't given anything special to do here, also wasted potential. But, boy, the skydive into Paris... the action scene in the bathroom... the rooftop chase scene... the scene where Ethan Hunt is posing as a terrorist and has to pretend to lead an organized and weaponized extraction of the world's top-fugitive from law-enforcement hands while simultaneously thwarting said extraction without blowing his cover... thrilling sequence.

It has a more serious tone which I noticed straight away, the action sequences are breathtaking and the cinematography is superb. However the storyline and last 15 minutes let it down for me. Up until that point I was enjoying it immensely but thinking about it I would probably consider it to be the best in the franchise. Cruise performs some of the most dangerous stunts ever put to screen and for the most part they are pretty much grounded and thrilling. It was sad to see a \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d style ending which let it down. It didn\u2019t need it. The film pretty much collectively sums up all of Ethan\u2019s previous exploits and again puts the people he cares about in jeopardy. It\u2019s not very original but it\u2019s is slickly made and reminded me more of a Bond film. The chase sequences on motorbikes and on foot are nothing short of spectacular and Cruise\u2019s very publicized broken ankle sequence is still as shocking when you see it again on screen. Henry Cavill and his mustache put in fine performances as menacing CIA agents tasked with keeping an eye on Ethan. The action sequences on display here are sublime, it\u2019s just a shame that there\u2019s not a better plot to back them up. ",

Henry Cavill killed his role as August Wilson; Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg were great supporting cast members but the most shocking to me was Ving Rhames. He had somewhat of an emotional arc that I wouldn't have seen coming from a mile away, but I was pleasantly surprised. My biggest take away from this film is that Chris McQuarrie, the Oscar winning writer, who wrote one of my favorite movies (The Usual Suspects), now has the potential to become one of the biggest action directors in Hollywood. I'm excited to see what his next project is. This film gets 4.5/5 for me.",

Just amazing. EDIT: I just got back from my second viewing of the opening weekend.

Despite that, It has flaws and I feel like I can be sure that it isn't the best film I have ever seen. I still loved this movie. This review is spoiler free. \n\n11/15 points go to the STORY category. This film has a good story where a load of confusion can be stirred up at any moment. There are loads of plot twists that aren't shocking due to a terrible marketing campaign. There are also unclear plans made at certain moments. The basic premise is nothing like I've ever seen though. \n\n10/10 points go to the ACTING category. Tom Cruise, who learned how to fly a helicopter for this movie, is stellar. He is a great actor who definitely does very well in this movie. Henry Cavill, Alec Baldwin, Simon Pegg, ect. also give amazing performances. They all seem very into character. \n\n10/10 points go to the VISUAL EFFECTS category. The film is visually stunning. I enjoy watching the visuals throughout and my eyes weren't hurt. \n\n10/10 points go to the CHARACTERS category. The characters are great. They have their purpose and they serve their purpose. If they need it, they get development. If they don't, they don't get it. It's simple as that. I think that the character who shines out most is Luther. Luther has an emotional moment and it really makes us see the character as more than a sidekick.\n\n4/ 5 points go to the DEVELOPMENT category. The film sees a problem, some twists, some mishaps, and a solution. There is one problem though. There are many characters who don't grow at all and don't get the ability to be seen in a whole new light. The characters do get into a different place than we saw them at first though.\n\n3/ 5 points go to the ORIGINAL SCORE category. The music is really good. Mission Impossible has some of the best music from what I've heard. The problem with this score is that there are parts that go with the movie only. You can't listen to them without the visuals of the film. This is a bit disappointing. \n\n5/5 points go to the DESIGN category. The film has a great costume design which makes the characters come to life. There is also good makeup. The design has nothing super special, but what it has is amazing. I especially love the technology designs.\n\n10/10 points go to the DIRECTION category. The film is directed well by whoever directed it. The fight scenes are well choreographed and everyone is well directed throughout. I think the direction in this movie is probably the most well directed of the year for live-action films.\n\n8/10 points go to the AUDIO AND VISUAL QUALITY category. The film sounds pretty good. There are many points where the movie sounds like just explosions and gunshots. The 3D effects are pretty meh, though what is decent is the fact that it doesn't look too dark in 3D. I'd recommend that you see this film in IMAX, where there are scenes where there is extra image. The music is also well done, and plays at the right moments.\n\n17/20 points go to the OVERALL CONSENSUS category. I thought this film was pretty good. It is at times slow, and the story is at times pretty horribly written. I think that the movie is pretty well made, choreographed, and directed. The thing about this film that stands out is the cinematography and fight scenes.\n\nScore: 88%\nGrade: B+",

From start to finish, Mission: Impossible - Fallout was action packed and had me on the edge of my seat. The cinematography was downright stunning. The skydiving scene, bathroom fight, car chase scene, etc are all AMAZING. In fact, everything about this film is amazing. There are dozens of moments that I was wrestling with myself over whether some shots were special effects or practical effects. The sound design is the best I\u2019ve heard since Blade Runner 2049. Every punch, gunshot, breaking of wall/shelves/tables/chairs, they all sounded so real. It helped emerse me into the movie even more. I only have one problem. I never really understood the motives of the villains. Some people just wanted anarchy, but others just did it... for an unexplained reason. I would have liked to hear a bit more from one character in particular on why he made the decisions he did, but either way he was still a great villain. So to some this review up, this was one of the most badass and crazy action films of this decade. It\u2019s up there with John Wick and Fury Road for sure. Additionally, it\u2019s the best of the Mission: Impossible series and every new installment just keeps getting better. 9.5/10",

            "content": "In \u201cFallout\u201d we see McQuarrie and Cruise team up for a second time in the franchise, and this time they go bigger than any \u201cMission\u201d has yet. Where most blockbusters seek to set the tone of their film by smashing together high-end VFX to get their audience engaged, \u201cFallout\u201d chooses a more brisk, easy-going, and familiar path to calm the audience before the storm. That storm being a heart-pounding thrill ride for 120 continuous minutes with countless twists, turns, and stomach lurches that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. That may sound unappetizing for those seeking substance underneath the style, but rest assured, McQuarrie takes care of the characters and the story with ease. Many action films today become bogged down in lofty, weightless ambitions that never give action scenes true value in their design. Here, there are moments where you can breathe easy, albeit brief, but those moments only enhance the spectacle. It\u2019s something that few action films have achieved throughout the course of cinema history, but it\u2019s something that McQuarrie has excelled in both times. What\u2019s most rewarding about \u201cFallout\u201d besides the outstanding setpieces and world class technical work, is the character work. Being the sixth film in the franchise, it\u2019s hard to wrap your head around the idea that McQuarrie has found a way to continuously make the characters interesting. Many of the relationships we see have already been founded, established, and built, but there are always complications that blocks Ethan\u2019s path to success. Thus giving the audience newer dimensions to explore with the face of the franchise. That face of the franchise being the \u201cmethod\u201d in \u201cthe method behind the madness\u201d, because \u201cFallout\u2019s\u201d action scenes are monumental. Many films try their hand at a Halo Jump sequence, but none even come close to what is accomplished here. Then, you think you\u2019ve seen it all, and McQuarrie, Cruise, and the rest of the crew go one step and one punch further by channeling their inner Bond to deliver a brutal bathroom brawl. Only to then be one-upped by a sequence in Paris that is choreographed with unparalleled precision that it makes any chase scene you\u2019ve seen prior look like a walk in the park. There\u2019s a slight hyperbole to that statement, but it\u2019s that damn good, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned the helicopter sequence. There is so much happening within \u201cFallout\u201d, but it\u2019s all focused, directed, and choreographed in the most rewarding way imaginable. The action is superb, but without the finely tuned character work they simply do not excel at the degree in which they do. As you\u2019ve read, \u201cMission: Impossible - Fallout\u201d is everything you anticipated it to be, and then some. It was hard to envision a reality in which a film could rival George Miller\u2019s \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d in terms of scale, artistry, precision, and stunt work back when it released in 2015, but \u201cFallout\u201d fights for the top spot. In many ways, you can see that McQuarrie was inspired by \u201cFury Road\u201d in how that film uses diegetic or non-diegetic music to amplify tension. Many boisterous and bombastic tunes are composed by Lorne Balfe, but he always reigns it back in with soft, calming tracks to keep the tension and heart hand in hand. Alongside that we see cinematographers Rob Hardy and Hugues Espinasse tighten their focus on each roar of a motorcycle or whipping of helicopter blades. The camerawork is constantly playing your heart like a drum, and Christopher McQuarrie guides it into the holy land of action films. Throughout the film you can see the utmost respect McQuarrie has to previous staples of the genre by sprinkling in homages to old Jackie Chan films, James Bond films, and works as recent as \u201cThe Raid\u201d. Recognizing that \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d would not be where it is without the grandfathers of the genre. Films like \u201cMission: Impossible - Fallout\u201d are a once in a franchise type of achievement and it, like Cruise, are showing no signs of slowing down. It\u2019s a harmonious action symphony for the record books that is filled to the brim with death-defying stunts, layered character work, and a mountainous celebration of the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d franchise. Mission accomplished. \u201cMission: Impossible - Fallout\u201d gets a 98/100",

The incredible set pieces are enhanced by the practical effects and Tom Cruise's dedication to doing his own stunts. The action, while being some of the best ever put to film, isn't the only great thing about the film. Fallout also boasts complex and likable characters. Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt, displays cynicism and weariness from his multiple exploits, yet is still always willing to do what he feels is right. He is joined on his mission by his lovable teammates Luther and Benji, played by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg. Rebecca Ferguson remains the badass we met in Rogue Nation. Henry Cavill has never been better than he is here as Cruise's rival who challenges him on a physical level, while also serving as a foil to the character of Ethan Hunt. The film's story takes all the best aspects of previous installments to create a tension filled experience that keeps the audience holding their breaths until the very exciting end. Christopher McQuarrie's Fallout succeeds in everything it set out to do, it has incredible action, strong acting, sleek direction, and an exciting story. If you want to check out one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the best action films of all time, then go check it out.",

            "content": "Good morning/afternoon/evening, fellow film spectator/movie viewer. Your optional mission, should you choose to accept it, is more of a recommendation that involves riding on the added set pieces of tracks that furthers the ride of a franchise known under \"Mission: Impossible\". If you have ridden through the first five missions, particularly the fifth and essentially the first and third - basically the odd-numbered missions - you should feel that the sixth mission under operation \"Fallout\" had heightened the adrenaline and complexity under the constant push over the last.\n\nHere's the lowdown of what's happening: After a mission gone wrong because of good intentions, the choices comes back to haunt and tests agent Ethan Hunt and the remaining available members of his IMF team. Conflicted with familiar allies while being monitored by the accompanied CIA agent, it becomes a race against time of overcoming obstacles that questions those usual motives to resolve the human error that would really put the world at risk.\n\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie has been steering the franchise's wheel for two missions since the fifth, which is more than those who previously helmed the past missions as mostly one-shots. McQuarrie's constant direction between the two missions has gotten a little heavier when still further pushing, testing and questioning what the filmic missions and tactics stands for, while also involving more personal stuff into the characters. The said push resulted in the aforementioned heightened complexity through thoroughly thought-out intelligence still pulling out twists and turns, as well planning out the action sequences to generate thrills as adrenaline's the main component to the push. The stylistic and subtly dramatic approach also went onto new testing grounds for the action genre.\n\nSingle-handedly grasping the adrenaline, Tom Cruise continues his usual risky take as an action movie star that's astonishingly gripping with tighter and larger space, delivered by taut cinematography in expressing the aura of the individual situation. But when he's not straining his muscles in stunts, he still performs almost at a same level in strength with his known casual charm.\n\nIn addition to Cruise's energy as part of the operation direction's furthering things particularly the emphasis on the inner and outer importance of the characters, the rest of the cast, most of them returned from few previous missions, followed well along that line of minimum expectation that Cruise set. Henry Cavill joins the team by literally punching into the game in attempt to credit the well-choreographed action with equivalent rivalry formation and reflective suspicion as part of a partially predictable twist till the confirmation around the surprising turning point. Returning from the previous mission, Rebecca Ferguson continues the favorable aspect surrounding her character while fulfilling another's half and breaking more of a barrier that improves the franchise's taste in casting.\n\nShould you or any of your party not find the time to experience what's being agreeably hailed as the best mission yet in the practical action franchise that seems to glorified the genre, knowledge of your decided actions will not be disavowed but to your own under the shrunken effect that tightens \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" to the acceptable minimum that will still deliver the thrills and intelligence. This review will self-destruct if something occurs in your present device that would make this unavailable. Have fun experiencing the thrill. (A+)",

The locations in this film stood out more than some other locations. I think this film had so many twist. I feel like this film got much better with Alec Baldwin. We got to see Alec Baldwin do different things than we saw him do in Rogue Nation. This was great to see on the big screen. There was so much to see in those wide shots. I don't think that this film was as good as Rogue Nation or Ghost Protocol as far as story. I really enjoy this film and will purchase it and recommend others to see it. I did not like the music as much in this film as in Rogue Nation, Ghost Protocol, Mission Impossible III, or Mission Impossible. I thought this film was interesting how they had so many different sides going after a single goal like the CIA, British Intelligence aka MI6, Mission Impossible Force, Plus the villains. I really liked the the stunts like the helicopter chase or the bathroom. The bathroom stunts were crazy intense. What was unique was how the guy they were fighting was shown as a better fighter than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt or Henry Cavil's character . This film did a great job on Henry Cavil as Superman without questioning him as Superman. I think that the mustache and the way the character was written worked in this film. I also liked that this film had a group that was an in between group that was working for the White Widow. That was an interesting twist seeing a group not working for a country but working for an inbetween group. I like how this film dealt with getting the bad guy out. This film was missing the comedy like in Rogue Nation or Ghost Protocol. There was not as much comedy in this film either from dialog lines or physical comedy. So in that sense this film missed it as far as the fun aspect. I thought this film was interesting in how they went about introducing Emma Faust to the story. I liked her entrance in the film. I like how the masks were used in this film. I also enjoyed how the Mission Impossible recording was done in a Iliad and the Odyssey book. I feel like having the girl from the 3rd Mission Impossible film was not done well enough in Fallout as it could have been just because her screen time was so minimal. I will say I enjoyed this film a lot but not as much as Mission Impossible films 3-5. ",

Fallout goes to multiple exotic locales, shot beautifully, and with memorable cinematography. The stunt work is immaculate with real stunts executed by Tom Cruise. The HALO jump is breathtaking, the bathroom fight is cool, and the gun-play is visceral. The fight choreography is brutal and feels like the punches have weight.\n\nTom Cruise is the main draw as always. His dedication to performing the stunts for real is admirable, but his dramatic acting as Ethan Hunt is still my favorite part. Cruise is the ultimate action star, but also an accomplished dramatic actor. He runs all over the world, jumps from roof to roof, actually flies a helicopter, jumps from a plane, fights men in hand to hand combat, and shoots firearms constantly in the most exhilarating Mission: Impossible film yet. I may prefer Ghost Protocol more still, but Fallout is a close second for the best Mission: Impossible movie for sure.\n\nThe supporting cast is particularly notable this time around with excellent performances all around. Cruise's Ethan Hunt is offset well by the always  hilarious Simon Pegg as Benji, who finally gets more to do in the franchise. Newcomer, Henry Cavill is intimidating and formidable as August Walker. Cavill holds his own both in combat and drama alike. \n\nSurprisingly, Ving Rhames is not only back, but he also gets to deliver more weighted dramatic dialogue. I really liked his performance here. He carries himself with an earnest concern for Ethan as well as a likable presence as Luther Stickell. Likewise, Alec Baldwin has a brief, but incredibly memorable role reprising his part as Alan Hunley. You'll like him in Fallout. \n\nSimilarly, Rebecca Ferguson kills it again as Ilsa Faust. She is cool, smart, and interesting as Ethan Hunt's foil and love interest. I wish there were even more of Ferguson! She could easily play the lead in the next movie. Next, Michelle Monaghan makes a neat cameo with some serious lines and a touching delivery. I was disappointed that her character goes in the direction they went with, but I understand. Lastly for the ladies, Angela Bassett gets a small, but integral role as the head of the CIA Erica Sloane. I hope she appears in more Mission: Impossible movies!\n\nIn regards to the villains, Sean Harris is frightening and monstrous as Solomon Lane. Harris is even scarier than he was in Rogue Nation. Also, Vanessa Kirby is sultry and intriguing as White Widow. I wonder if they'll bring her back as she has potential for more on screen crime. She is pleasantly good in Fallout. Overall, the entire ensemble is excellently well cast and aptly utilized. \n\nAll in all, you will be entertained by Fallout. I think there is plenty here for any audience. Fast paced action, character progression, enjoyable dialogue, intriguing story, clever fake outs, and funny jokes. Fallout is phenomenal!",

What pushed me over the edge of giving it 5 stars were definitely the action sequences, so let's talk about those. This movie has one of the most exhilarating and intense action sequences of the past decades. What you should know going into this movie is that Tom Cruise practically did all of his own stunts. The helicopter chase, the jumping over buildings, escaping on a motorcycle on a busy street, everything was Tom Cruise. The story too is phenomenal, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) returning was a really good part of the continuity between these movies. The situations these characters are brought in and how they react to those situations is truly in there own character and all of it is executed very well. Some of the dialogue was a bit choppy and didn't feel right, talking about Angela Bassett here. But still, this is the perfect action movie and definitely one of the best action movies of the past decade. The soundtrack by Lorne Balfe is also excellent and feels so epic with so much tension for an action movie. The fight scenes and the choreography in them was also amazing, especially the bathroom fight, those punches look and feel real. The cinematography is also very good, Rob Hardy is really making a name for himself. Overall I just really loved this movie, please go see it.",

            "content": "If action is what you want this summer, well congratulations - you're in luck. Since the original TV show and De Palma's first movie, 'Mission: Impossible' has undergone a vast evolution. Whereas the series was more of a thriller before, it has now become an all-out action extravaganza; far more focused on car chases, fist-fights and death-defying stunts than it is on story. This has its ups and downs, with the plot in particular - for the most part a typical twisty-turney, nuclear weapon, end of the world type deal - easy to criticise. Nonetheless, although it's clearly just glue between set-pieces, McQuarrie is a talented enough writer to make it interesting. And as far as action goes, 'Fallout' is leaps and bounds above pretty much every other action franchise around. Even though I don't think it has any sequences on par with the Burj Khalifa scene in 'Ghost Protocol' nor the opera scene in 'Rogue Nation', a white-knuckled bathroom fight, an amazing motorcycle chase and a bevy of other vehicular madness ensures you are left gripping your seat for a good proportion of the runtime.\n\n'Fallout' is undoubtedly a technical masterpiece, and another great addition to the franchise in keeping with the previous two instalments. As far as summer blockbusters go, this is pretty much perfect. I do, however, think the series is coming to a point where - if it wishes to continue - it needs to be reinvented once again. For the first time in quite a while I felt like the formula was starting to show, just a little. They changed it up in 'Ghost Protocol', let's hope they can do it again.",
