            "content": "Incredible film by Stanley Kubrick. I don't watch movies often, but this surely was one to remember. It is different from the common horror film in it's slower progression, which i'm sure many didn't like, but the progression, atmosphere, and camerawork of this movie make it truly unique. It's take on horror is more gradual, deep, and connected, with actors who were purposefully chosen due to their \"imperfect/ugly\" appearances. Overall though, The Shining is a good movie for if you want a movie which is LESS like the original book with it's unique plot, and more of a different story with different characters overall. The movie also promotes many theories and leads to speculation, which if you don't look up the answers to them, can be a difficult challenge to try to answer yourself.\n\nDefinitely a good movie to watch with friends, and a great beginner horror-fan movie as well.",

            "content": "A Horror Classic. The acting is phenomenal with perfect casting and real unease and tension amongst everyone that builds throughout. Jack Torrance is one of the best villains in any film with a beyond memorable performance that lingers well after the credits role. This film easily is not as iconic and memorable without Jack Nicholson being cast. Wendy & Danny are excellent also. The cinematography is phenomenal in making a bland location extremely memorable with amazing well framed and lit shots with terrific camerawork throughout. The music is incredibly creepy, memorable and varied which is a tremendous accomplishment as well. The pacing is flawless with the tension not just coming from the creepiness, music tone changes and surreal images but really the tension amongst Jack and the others as they slowly crack. The climax of the door axing is incredibly terrifying. The only problem is the editing and the abstractness that runs throughout this film from the middle to the end. While they are incredibly well done scenes on their own being very creepy and unsettling, they don't form or take away from the narrative at times. Perfect examples are scenes like Room 237, Mr. Grady, Wendy and the two guests in the room at the end, The Shining subplot, Redrum meaning, etc. I feel the ending shot should've been the only abstract scene left in similar to the open ending to The Thing (1982) and focused squarely on Jack going insane and leaving things sparsely open to interpretation as to why. This would've let the viewer fill in the gaps and because this is so well done it would've been easy for them to pain a picture far more terrifying than abstract. Key scenes like Jack at the bar and him writing should be left in to leave enough breadcrumbs for a viewer to form their own opinion but it definitely needed to tone down on the weird abstract scenes. It left me more scratching my head afterwards than terrified. Though it did that very well throughout as well. Anyone who is a Kubrick fan, a fan of any actors in this, or Horror films in general will love this.",

This is the problem; the decision was not clear on whether to take the fiction into consideration while writing the plot, or just use it as an appendage to an already-consistent plot, which resulted in a bit of hollowness. However, with taking the aforementioned into consideration or without it, Stanley Kubrick's pure artistry in filming should make The Shining a must-watch.",

            "content": "The Shinning(1980)\nBy: Abby Dickson \n\tAfter recently viewing The Shining (1980), directed by Stanley Kubrick I believe that it was spectacular. It was one of the scariest horror films I have ever seen. It is very unlike it novel by Stephen Kings The gorry music gave me chills all over my body, \n\tThe Shining is about the Torrance family Jack, Wendy, and five-year-old Danny. They go to a hotel that certainly has a supernatural presence that is affecting the family.\tThe movie details their tragic experience at the hotel and the toll that it takes on the family members.\nThe film was overall a great hit. Jack Nickelson's role was outstanding and when first seeing him, he seemed a little weird he is so light-hearted in the senses, especially the scary and horrific ones. In some sense, he uses so many quotable lines, but as we watch his sanity break down by whatever this presence is at this hotel is riveting. I loved the sense where we watch him stalk Shelly up the stairs.\nThe imagery in the film is by far haunting. From the twins at the end of the hallway to the blood coming out of the elevator. As well as the musical tone. It is very gorry and almost unsettling.    \n\tIt shows a bond between a family and goes on to appeal to the fear they feel while experiencing their horrific time at this hotel. It is a film that has inspired generations of horror film creators and directors. \n\tIf you are a horror guru then this movie is for you. It is by far one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Although I do not recommend it as a family horror movie. The content in this film is for sure for older viewers. This film is overall amazing and very well expressed throughout. It is one of the top horror movies of all time.",

            "content": "The movie I will be reviewing is The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick.  The genre of this movie is horror, thriller, and psychological.  I love horror movies, and I have seen this a few times.  I enjoyed The Shining because it makes you think about what you're watching and keeps you on your toes.  The movie is based on the book from Stephen King.  \n\tThe main characters, Jack, Wendy, and their son, Danny go to an abandoned Overlook Hotel in colorado.  Jack is a writer and goes there to cure his writer's block.  Danny has visions and they start getting worse the longer that they are at the hotel.  Jack starts discovering the hotel's dark secrets and goes into a manic state, causing him to terrorize his family.  \n\tI like this film because of the horror and psychological sense of it.  I like the chilling feel that I get from the ghosts appearing in the hotel.  The uneasy music in the background adds to the eerie feeling.  The acting in this movie is unreal.  They really capture the characters from the novel.  The emotions that the actors provide are amazing.  The clothing is fitting for the time period and suits the theme.  For example, Danny has a spaceship on his shirt, and they show him playing with toys to provide the innocence of a child.  The movie really captures how a normal family can switch instantly.  \n\tThe theme that I got from The Shining is fearing paranormal activity and isolation.  The themes showed me how paranormal activity can be very sinister.  The isolation theme showed me how much isolation can cause a manic state.  It shows how being alone can cause you to do things that you never thought of doing.  I think others can learn how isolation and paranormal activity can cause mania, and others can see what it's like for people to switch like Jack does.  \n\tIf you love psychological and horror movies, The Shining is a great movie to watch.  I would recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who feel uncomfortable with seeing mental illness decline, and people who get spooked easily because it could cause a ton of uneasiness.  Overall, The Shining is a great film to watch if you love horror and psychological movies.  \n Rating: ****",

I didn't connect to it as much this time around, and it was a lot shorter.\n\nI absolutely love how the film opens up. That opening shot in the mountains, was just beautifully done.\n\nI've always heard about how Shelley Duvall was bitter about this movie cause of the way she was treated and that all the accolades fell on Jack. She has no right to be mad about that. In my opinion, she doesn't deserve any praise for this role. Her performance was mediocre and forgettable. She should be happy that people remember her at all. \n\nWe all know that this movie is all about Jack. He was a walking highlight reel in this role. He did no wrong in this movie. His subtle facial expressions, his breathing, the way he walked, every little thing he did was just spot on. \n\nMy favorite scene was the confrontation between Jack and Wendy in the Colorado room. Jack mimics Wendy, and repeats the \"as soon as possible\" line. \n\nAfter this second viewing, I currently feel like this movie isn't worth all the hype. I need to watch the regular long version again in a few months, and write another review. \n\nDo I seriously need to recommend this film? Of course you should watch this. Just make sure you're watching the king cut.\n\nThis film gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 7/10",

Danny Lloyd was good as Danny, with it being his powers that bring the hotel to life.

            "content": "A modern masterpiece.  Rightfully called one of the scariest movies of all time.  This is the undisputed paragon of haunted house epics. The Shining is essentially Stephen King's reboot of Shirley Jackson's 1959 haunted house epic The Haunting of Hill House; also about an evil supernaturally possessed house that draws people into it; a house with a sordid dark history and many deaths; with the purpose of absorbing people into it's lair; thereby absorbing their powers.  In both stories the inhabitants of the house have ESP; which is why the house has chosen them; and why it is trying to destroy and absorb them into it's interdimensional vortex.  The book is also inspired by Stephen King's experiences staying at the infamous Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Colorado; nestled in the heart of the Rocky Mountains.  He and his wife Tabitha stayed there in 1974 for one night; staying in the infamous room 217; and he was instantly transfixed and brainstormed the Shining story based on his real life creepy experiences there.  In addition the book is an allegory about King's own substance abuse; which was careening out of control in the late 70s; the story itself being a projection about his own fears about his illness, and the effects it could have on his wife and two small children.  So from all that we get The Shining.  The story is about the Torrance family;  Jack, Wendy and Danny;  and how they move into the Overlook hotel; a Colorado ski resort in the Rockies where several murders and mysterious deaths have occurred in the past.  Eventually it becomes clear the house is possessed and very much alive; and is attempting to manipulate Jack to kill Wendy and Danny; so that it can absorb Danny's considerable ESP powers.  The movie follows Jack's Exorcist-like deterioration from a mild mannered freelance writer to a demonic psychopath; who is being helped in his nefarious plot by the spirits in the house.  The grand sweep of Kubrick's direction is absolutely stunning; rare for a horror film to have such virtuosity behind the camera.  Kubrick infact helped invent and develop steadicam technology for this movie which continues to have an impact on film today.  King famously hated this movie; which makes sense; he is a fundamentally different artist than Kubrick.  Kubrick was an absurdist; and King is a romantic, (of the Edgar Allen Poe type).  And admittedly the movie isn't very faithful to the book.  But Kubrick's downcast scorched earth perspective; dissecting the characters from a microscope like a merciless scientist dissecting a squirming bug under glass; absolutely adds to the drama.  So much of the movie's effectiveness is just that devastating; psychotic mood; tension filled and terrifying; tension so thick you can cut it like a knife; which fills the screen as soon as the movie starts.  No one could have accomplished this dazzling, transfixing and terrifying mood better than Stanley Kubrick.  Inspite of King's misgivings about him; Kubrick was actually born to direct this movie. And there are so many stunning horror set pieces here.  The British Grady twins chanting in perfect, eerie unison; Danny big-wheeling across the miles of hardwood resort floors like he's in the Indiana 500; seeing horrific phantasmagoria all around him; Wendy stumbling upon the spirit of Horace Derwent and his bear-suited employee in compromising positions; and on and on; so many terrifying, effective scenes.

The excreble Kubrick eschews this in favor of Jack Nicholson behaving like a drunken brute who cares nothing for his son and has contempt for his wife from the outset.  The later events of the movie have no impact because Jack was a drunken mean brute to begin with.  The only reason why this movie gets 1.5 stars rather than the .5 star it used to deserve is because doctor sleep managed to salvage something workable from the wreckage.",

Having seen The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them, I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations, apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed, making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam, and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective, and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different, and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking, the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack, a performance that is both hammy and disturbing, and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny, his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending, and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The Shining is a strange one. In many respects it's an excellent film in its own right, but it's a terrible adaptation, with Stephen King famously saying he hated it.

The cast does a good job, certainly Jack Nicholson as John Torrance and Shelley Duvall as his wife, Wendy.

Jack Nicholson gives one of the best performances that transformed horror, by using his pure talent to create real and natural horror through body language compared to the conventions of Slashers. Shelley Duvall also adds to this by giving a true to life depiction of complete fear, and although she can be annoying in this it never comes across as inherently bad, unlike the child actor who just was very meh, which I don't blame him for ,after all he is just a child. I still find this to be very cryptic and mysterious which I like, but at the same time I want to understand it more and it comes off as being too cryptic for the sake of it rather than being a bit easier to interpret, but maybe that's just the way I process it. There's a lot of truly iconic scenes and true horror that just isn't done anymore, choosing to cop out with jumpscares instead was truly the death of modern horror, anyways way better on a second watch and can't wait to finish Kubrick's filmography.",

In true Kubrick fashion, we are left with the sense of an evil that we cannot name, born equally of the tenuous limitations of our own sanity and the fabric of a sinister spirit world lurking beneath the everyday surface. Although departing considerably from Stephen King's own vision of the material, \"The Shining\" is a terrifying, hallucinogenic experience that befits the best of the horror genre.",

Having seen The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them, I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations, apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed, making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam, and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective, and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different, and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking, the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack, a performance that is both hammy and disturbing, and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny, his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending, and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

There's a lot of drama, conspiracies, and history surrounding the development of this movie, but once you dive down the rabbit hole, there is so much to understand and appreciate.\n\nJack Nicholson is the only person who could have ever played this role. There's a unique insincerity behind his eyes throughout the whole film which made me uncomfortable even before the fucked-up stuff starts happening. I'm still mad that they tried to recast him for Doctor Sleep. Shelley Duvall is iconic and underappreciated, with her shrill screams and haunting desperation.\n\nThe story itself is fairly minimal, mostly due to the film's tendency to Not Fucking Explain Anything, which is part of what I love about it. It doesn't wrap everything up in a neat little bow (to the dismay of Stephen King), instead leaving everything open-ended and mysterious. There are clues here and there and a lot of valid headcanons, but the uncertainty adds to the unsettling feeling you get throughout the whole film.\n\nIt took me a few viewings of this movie to really appreciate Wendy as a character. She gets a lot of hate in the horror-movie community for being sort of incompetent when it comes to escaping her pursuer. But I'm finally realizing that the movie, at its core, is about Wendy coming to terms with her abusive relationship and building up the strength to leave. It's wrapped up in a twisted haunted house story, but that's really the root of this incredible film.\n\nNow, do I wish they hadn't used the N-word unnecessarily three times in a row? I sure do. But this is undeniably a groundbreaking, gut-wrenching, utterly terrifying tale with impeccable direction and acting. And that's why it's my favorite movie of all time.",

            "content": "The Shining, the most recognizable, iconic, influential and one of the most perfectly made horror movies of all time. This movie at the time received a ton of backlash and was heavily misunderstood. But now it's getting the respect it deserves by critics and casual watchers alike. Though what makes this movie so perfect? Well first of all the symbolism. This movie symbolizes that when us as humans work to much we can ruin our lives or just have no fun and drive ourselves into insanity. This is shown when Jack Torrance is a writer and usually just works on novels all day. Though when Shelley so much as wants to spend time with him even he gets pissed he just wants to focus on work and not have fun. This is also shown through the phrase \"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\"  He gets so pissed off in fact that he says that he works so hard to have a good life while he's really just working his life away and going insane. Which leads him to want to kill his wife and kid. Another great aspect of this movie is the cinematography. This is a beautifully shot movie and was as perfect as it could be. Stanley Kubrick  (a producer of the shining) would often retaken shots numerous times just to get it exactly as he envisioned it In his head. For example the most notorious is the staircase scene which was shot 127 TIMES. That SCENE WAS AT LEAST A MINUTE SO THEY SPENT AT LEAST 2 HOURS. ON. ONE. SCENE. Plus Stanley Kubrick would push his actors to the limit and often bully them just to get a \"realistic\" performance. However out of all the actors he bullied Shelly Duvall the most. He constantly made her think that she was wasting everyone's time, that she was bad at acting, and just overall bullied her badly. This resulted in her crying so much they had to keep WATER BOTTLES on set because she ran out of tears and lost chunks of her hair. But this resulted in a lot of the shots in the movie being beautiful like the shot where Jack is bleeding out in the maze it's beautiful. The acting in this move is semi-realistic but that's kinda the best you can do in a horror movie. If it was realistic it would be as long as a Regular Show episode. How do you think the Child's Play franchise would've happened without this principle? There were some times were Shelly could've just walked out with her son while Jack was locked in the freezer but ok. But the acting is good for a horror movie. Especially in Jack he is portrayed amazingly as a character. Also this movie is so iconic and influential. It's in the Simpsons and Seed Of Chucky just to name a couple. The line \"Here's Johnny!\" is a line anyone over 5 knows. Also it's still remembered today and regencies it's held up for 40 years without a sequel, It has to be good! While U really like the idea of The Shining power how you can see and hear things others can't and telepathically talk with other people with \"The Shining\". I also love how Danny uses it to mess with him constantly. Also it's just a fun concept with room 237 and everything it really adds on to the movie. It's great how it connects two characters that are not connected in anyway and makes you get a little attached to them and forms a relationship between them and that other character. Overall this movie is great in what it tries to do, extremely  iconic and a myst watch for people who love movies in general especially symbolism. 10/10 Watch It Now.",

            "content": "The Shining is one of the most classic horror films, and for good reason. It is a movie which truly defined the genre of psychological horror, using atmosphere and symbolism throughout to thoroughly unsettle its audience. It follows Jack Torrance, a struggling writer, and his family as they spend the winter as the caretakers of a large, empty hotel. However, when Jack's son, Danny, starts having psychic visions of terrifying murders and ghosts that haunt the hotel, it quickly becomes apparent that there is something very wrong. \n\nI feel that what makes The Shining such an effective psychological thriller is the extensive use of mise-en-scene to create the atmosphere. For example, the hotel layout as shown in the movie is impossible- the rooms and hallways twist and turn to make a space that is much larger than the physical hotel. This creates uncertainty, and unsettles the audience. In the famous scene where the child, Danny, rides around on his tricycle, the camera glides low and close behind him as he pedals through the halls. We don't know what lies beyond each corner- we see what Danny sees, when he sees it. The suspense is masterfully constructed, and we have no choice but to watch in fear as Jack spirals down into madness. \n\nHowever, where it excels at being extremely unsettling at points, The Shining isn't necessarily a scary movie. In fact, I would argue that all of the actual \"horror\" parts of the movie fell flat. For all of the build-up to the part where Jack finally snaps, the actual reveal and everything after was a complete letdown. Earlier on in the movie, Jack sustained an injury which gave him a pronounced limp- but so pronounced that any character who could break into a light jog could easily outrun him. This effectively got rid of any sense of urgency and fear, and turned something that should have been the terrifying final chase into a tedious run-around. On top of the already poor pacing, the use of plastic, Spirit- Halloween reminiscent skeletons and cobwebs added a layer of absurdity, sharply contrasting with the artful use of props throughout the rest of the film. It's almost as if the last 20 minutes had a different director altogether, which ended the movie on a rather disappointing note. \n\nIn summary, if you're looking for a straightforward horror movie with jump scares and gross-out terror, The Shining is definitely not your movie. That being said, this movie does contain some truly brilliant, unsettling scenes. As a long-time horror movie fan, it was interesting and fun to have a horror experience that is so different from the typical ghost/demon/monster fare. Despite its faults, The Shining has an atmosphere to it that makes it such a classic horror film- and one well worth the watch.",

During his stay with his wife and his son, Danny, Jack begins to feel a sinister atmosphere. Danny starts to have a series of disturbing visions and Jack's writer's block worsens. As a result, Jack goes on a murderous rampage, targeting his family. To start, the film is excessively long. If Kubrick and his editor had taken a \"less is more approach\" and cut the runtime to about 100 minutes, the story's pacing would better suit the tiny cast and limited settings.\nWith that being said, Kubrick was a master of horror and suspense in his day, and this acclaimed classic proves that he deserved his rank. The composers of this film also did some immaculate work, providing the world of cinema with one of the greatest soundtrack themes in history. The film also boasted several displays of stunning cinematography during scenes like the one filmed in the never-ending hedge maze. And though compact, the whole cast gave huge performances. Then rookie child actor, Danny Lloyd, specifically delivered a great performance despite the long hours and extensive takes. You've gotta hand it to the little dude... I enjoyed this classic; but unlike most of the film's cult following, I appreciated the film more so for its superb technical aspects rather than its adjudged, iconic creepy twins or Jack Torrance's mental breakdown one-liners. That isn't to take away from these elements of the film, though. These elements made The Shining legendary, but the entire pre- and post-production team deserve their accolades, too. In conclusion, you should see the film at least once in your lifetime. Try to avoid the hype until you have, though... 82%!",
