    "summary": "Dr. Frederic Treves (Anthony Hopkins) discovers Joseph (John) Merrick (John Hurt) in a sideshow. Born with a congenital disorder, Merrick uses his disfigurement to earn a living as the \"Elephant Man.\" Treves brings Merrick into his home, discovering that his rough exterior hides a refined soul, and that Merrick can teach the stodgy British upper class of the time a lesson about dignity. Merrick becomes the toast of London and charms a caring actress (Anne Bancroft) before his death at 27.",

Maybe the saddest music I've ever heard), all make me cry but The Elephant Man destroys me. It is without a doubt the saddest movie I've ever seen but there is a good amount of hope and overcoming despair. This movie will move you emotionally. It shows humanity at its worst and at its best but be prepared because above all this move is more heartbreaking then anything you have seen by far. Everyone should watch it at least once.",

I had wanted to see it for some time and it lived up to my expectations, with a great, solid performance from both John Hurt as the titular character and Anthony Hopkins, as the doctor who comes across him and does his best to help him.\n\nOf course, there are some awkward moments, with Merrick struggling to be heard coherently thanks to his deformed mouth causing him to make quite a lot of sucking and otherwise garbled noises, while he struggles to speak. This may be quite off-putting for some. I can't imagine how anyone couldn't feel some level of sadness or sympathy towards this character though. It's sad how much emphasis society still, even to this day, places on physical appearance. There is some quite touching dialogue. \n\nThis is a solemn watch, in terms of the themes but its not a visually gory film, with little in the way of actual violence depicted in any real detail. There are some slightly sinister moments but their not gratuitously gory as such. This is a very good film to see, if you want to start a debate about the importance of physical looks in society, I'd say and so I would definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "You have got to love the Elephant Man. There isn't one scene that doesn't move me. It is also underrated, as it is very difficult to find, and is hardly on TV. The cinematography was beautiful, and the subject matter about a doctor treating a heavily-disfigured man is so sensitively handled I felt I was there. One of the most moving scenes, was right at the beginning when Treves sees Merrick for the first time, and a tear rolls down his cheek.Extraordinary! The scene with Treve's wife is so sad that I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the movie. When he cries, \"I am not an animal, I am a human being,\" I was actually sobbing. i really was. The ending, with the lovely Adagio for Strings(the only time it has been played well) was so poignant, as was the scene in the theatre, with the Tchaikovsky-like music, and Merrick enjoying himself like a 6 year old boy. The music is very haunting, as made apparent in the crowd scene mocking Merrick in the hospital. Don't criticise the beginning, or the end, because David Lynch was trying to create images of pure sadness and inner beauty, and they were very powerful images. As for the performances, never have I seen Anthony Hopkins more sensitive than he was here(well except for the final scene of Shadowlands). His performance was actually one of the main reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The best performance, without a doubt, is the heart-rending performance of John Hurt as John Merrick. Almost unrecognisable, but so magnificent, especially when he recited the psalm without the help of Treves. It is also incredibly difficult to speak with a lopsided mouth, and John Hurt mastered it. Other notable performances are from Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud. Anyone who gave this a 1/10, what is wrong with you? This is an absolute masterpiece, without question! 10/10. Bethany Cox",

The entire film itself is depressing and can be hard to watch for certain people, especially those who have experienced similar situations, yet this movie does have a fantastic and uplifting message.

            "content": "David Lynch's \"The Elephant Man\" is an absorbing, gripping and surreal period piece that sheds light on tragic struggles faced by patients born with traumatic deformities. With his second feature, director David Lynch crafted a mesmerizing black-and-white historical drama about a mistreated deformed patient that has stood the test of time as a cinematic classic. Using spellbinding cinematography, Lynch draws viewers into the world of a mistreated deformed man that struggles to be accepted in upper-class 19th Century London society. Lynch's decision to shoot the movie using black-and-white is risky, but it works immensely. It lends an eerie and ominous atmosphere to the movie, signaling John Merrick's powerless position as an abused victim in society. Lynch exhibits immense control of craftsmanship over production design, editing and musical cues, using these elements to craft an immersive cinematic experience. Lynch's screenplay is also superb, and effectively employs minimal dialogue to build empathy for a deformed patient in 19th Century London. It's hard to not praise phenomenal performances from the cast. John Hurt delivers one of the finest performances of his career as John Merrick. With riveting expressions, he conveys angst, loneliness and resilience of a mistreated deformed patient that seeks a sense of belonging in 19th Century London. Anthony Hopkins is equally astonishing in the role of a compassionate surgeon that puts his career on the line to save a deformed patient. In one of his earliest roles, Hopkins imbues humanity into a doctor that would serve him well later in his career. Although \"The Elephant Man\" is undeniably an unforgettable period piece, ultimately it isn't quite a masterpiece. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it builds to an ambiguous ending that lacks Lynch's most satisfying resolutions. Nevertheless, fans of period pieces will certainly appreciate \"The Elephant Man\" and so will movie-goers seeking heartfelt entertainment. More than 100 years after John Merrick's death, Lynch's master-work remains a stirring reminder that people born with severe deformities deserve to be treated with compassion rather than cruelty even if their ugly appearances may suggest otherwise.",

The film features Anthony Hopkins as Frederic Treves, a medical doctor who stumbles across the grotesquely deformed John Merrick on display in a circus freak show. Saving Merrick from savage beatings and the daily indignities of his life, Treves is able to provide Merrick with some semblance of human dignity and a sense of pride.  Lynch's direction is subdued but extremely effective.  The scene where the camera slowly and without cuts zooms in on Hopkins when he sees Merrick for the first time is brilliant and touching.  The black and white cinematography by Freddie Francis is equally effective, capturing London during the Industrial Revolution as a city filled with shadows, drifting smoke and squalid streets.",

I think the performances elevate this one massively. Firstly, Hopkins is reliably superb as the doctor helping Hurt, who steals the show in no small part thanks to the wondrous makeup work by 1980 standards. The film being in black and white also helps with the setting and making the makeup look more natural than maybe it would have in colour. Some, albeit not many, elements of the film see some of Lynch's more eccentric tendencies coming through. There is a lot of room in the film for large masses of undesirable and exploitative characters and situations that successfully unsettle the audience. What holds this one back is its reliance on quite a tried and tested, common drama formula. Although it is wonderful to see Hurt as Merrick find his place in the world after experiencing a mass of lows, the story is predictable and does not have a speck of mystery or doubt over its outcome. Despite this negative, the performances, visuals, and earnest perspective of a version of history provide a worthwhile viewing experience.",

The Elephant Man is securely among the latter of the two, likely owing to a combination of its distressing subject, black and white color scheme, and the presence of Lynch's traditional fascination with the twisted and deformed (even presented in a far more conventional format than some of his more shocking filmography). Regardless, Hurt gives a passionate performance even beneath the mountain of fantastically well-realized prosthetics, and the themes are relatively simple but feel complete and powerfully rendered.

            "content": "The Elephant Man is a film that tells a heavily-altered version of the true story of Joseph Merrick, a severely disfigured man who became somewhat famous in Victorian London. I know they played a bit fast-and-loose with the truth when making this film because I went down a deep internet rabbit hole reading up on this man\u2019s life after watching the film. That is typically a good sign that a biopic connected with me, when I am so touched by the story that I want to know more. It\u2019s hard not to get emotionally invested in a tale like this, particularly when we see an innocent man treated with such indignity through no fault of his own. I was hooked by the story even though it\u2019s a somewhat familiar tale. I thought the cast all did a wonderful job, especially John Hurt who had to perform with those complicated prosthetics. The villains of the story might have been a bit exaggerated, but otherwise I thought the character work was delightful. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is when Anthony Hopkins\u2019s character is forced to look at what he is doing for his friend, and questions whether he has actually improved his situation. It makes you think a bit more about what is happening, and calls into question how people sometimes take advantage of those less fortunate than themselves. At first, I thought they might avoid ever showing us the appearance of John Merrick, and allow our imaginations to fill in the gaps, but I think the choice to present it with extreme makeup effects worked well for the kind of story they wanted to tell. Keeping him in the dark or off-screen would have dehumanized him too much, and the entire film is about showing that there was a human underneath the mask. I usually struggle to understand why modern filmmakers choose to shoot in black-and-white, and this film was no exception. I suppose it might have added to the old-timey quality of this story, but it never felt necessary. That being said, it\u2019s a high-quality film that had me on an emotional roller coaster for the full 2 hours.",

I loved the remarkable cast; I loved the use of horror and science-fiction conventions to convey a story with so much humanity at its heart; I loved the film's willingness to allow strange, surreal sequences; I loved the allusions to pipes and steam and engines and the like, suggesting to me an idea that the more technologically advanced we become, the less human we are; I loved the reminder that Anthony Hopkins can act with restraint - a skill which he has seemed so reluctant to embrace since Silence of The Lambs (no criticism of that film, incidentally - more of a reflection on how he allowed himself to slip into roles written with less room for silence and subtlety); I loved the patience of the film-making.\n\nI found myself reflecting on my sense of being an outsider - a sharp issue for me; and also on my own tradition's (I'm a Christian pastor) habit at times of making a show out of 'healing', of treating a condition or a problem and not a person - an issue at the heart of this film in terms of how John Merrick is treated both by many in science and in wider society. \n\nA beautiful, haunting, compassionate and thoughtful triumph.",

            "content": "The film that inspired the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling was groundbreaking in how realistically it was able to show the facial deformity that Joseph Merrick suffered from but it does not feel innovative in any other way. David Lynch who had directed Eraserhead (1977) just three years earlier significantly tones down his personal style to make a commercial hit and major Academy Award nominee. It is a real shame because it would have been fascinating to see his strange sensibilities applied to a story about a man who sees things differently than everybody else and is mocked for his physical and mental differences.\n\nRespected surgeon Frederick Treves, Anthony Hopkins, is fascinated when he hears of a \"Freak\" known as the Elephant Man and pays his selfish and abusive \u2018owner' Mr. Bytes, Freddie Jones. He is initially horrified by Joseph Merrick, John Hurt, due to his facial deformities but wants to treat him at the hospital he works at and through speech therapy helps the man gain the ability to communicate and a measure of dignity. Treves becomes concerned however when a visit from famed Shakespearean actress Madge Kendal, Anne Bancroft, causes Merrick to become a celebrity and he is bombarded by socialites hoping to stare at him. Meanwhile a low level employee at the hospital, Jim, Michael Elphick, charges people to visit Merrick at night without his consent. One night Bytes pays to see him and kidnaps him. Merrick has a horrific experience when forced to perform again but is freed by fellow performers before being harassed in a train station where he finally asserts his desire to be treated as a man and not as an animal. He faces health problems when he returns to the hospital but he and Treves have reconciled and he is happy that he has been accepted in society.\n\nLike most films based on true stories this film offers us a heavily sanitized version of Merrick's real life as it becomes an uplifting tale of how education can give a person dignity instead of the story of a man who commit suicide at 27. His struggles outside of having evil, lower class British men take advantage of him are not depicted in depth and the bond between Merrick and Treves, the emotional center of the film, does not receive enough attention. Yes, we see Merrick go to his surgeon's house and have him discuss his love for his mother who he worries would not have loved him due to his appearance. This was a touching moment but later scenes that rest on us wanting Merrick to be reunited with his closest ally are not as impactful as they should be because we do not have an understanding of what has bound them together so tightly.\n\nDespite this there are miraculous things about the film as Hurt's performance is impressive even behind all that make-up evokes all of the emotion that his character feels and through his physicality we feel his self loathing, fear and love for those who care for him. Hopkins is decent as the stiff but supportive surgeon and it is fun to see him throw a man half his size against the wall. It is odd to see Bancroft play British but she fits the role surprisingly well and brings some vibrancy to the film in one scene in which she teaches our protagonist about Shakespeare. There is also the stunning black and white cinematography which looks beautiful and gets the dourness of London perfectly as well as providing an opportunity for the bright white light to represent Merrick's happiness. Unfortunately this is a film that is less than the sum of it's parts as there are scenes in the film that just go too far as one where the dastardly Jim, never more than a caricature, and his patrons terrorize Merrick was so overwrought that I did not see the sadness in his situation and found it in some ways funny. \n\nMany connect to this film because they feel that they can relate to Merrick, a classic outsider, but I wish that the film had displayed the discrimination that he faces and the resources he uses to earn acceptance in society with more subtlety.",

            "content": "A touchstone for empathy.\n\nDavid Lynch's biopic The Elephant Man (1980) chronicles the lifelong suffering, cruelty, and eventual kindness felt by Joseph Merrick also known as The Elephant Man. This film is a beautiful capturing the deep emotions of a poor man that faced unimaginable cruelty, abuse, enslavement, starvation, ridicule, embarrassment, frustration, isolation, and severe deformity. The Elephant Man was indeed a man who had to cope with his deformed and afflicted condition with no chance for a cure. All he was given was a friend.\n\nThe Elephant Man is David Lynch's most humanistic film. Lynch's direction leaves the camera to focus and zoom in on the reactions of people's shocked, horrified, jeering, and sympathetic faces alike to seeing Merrick. Lynch's direction is impressive because he forces viewer to imagine how Merrick feels about being gawked at and leered at for all hours of every day. Lynch forces his perspective in order to convey a touching empathy for Merrick. We must confront his appearance and feel his emotions. Lynch's direction is astonishing in relating Merrick's emotions with a simple frame. \n\nThe Elephant Man's black and white aesthetic is a brilliant choice for it harks back to an older era, while allowing for total immersion into the time period. Lynch's noir direction uses long panning shots down dark street and isolating rooms with smoky fog and dim lighting to create a haunting atmosphere throughout The Elephant Man. The stunning photography leaves the audience with unforgettable images. For example, the first time we see Merrick at the freak show or every time the camera zooms in on Merrick's mother in the picture. \n\nLynch's stark visuals give way to endearing performances of resplendent leading performances from Sir John Hurt and Sir Anthony Hopkins. Hurt delivers his greatest role as \"John Merrick\" the Elephant Man. Hurt depicts a man stricken by illness and limited in his movements, voice, and stature by these maladies. Hurt is genius at remaining expressive whether he is under heavy makeup, a bag mask, or just close up to his eyes. Hurt elevates The Elephant Man to untold heights of sympathy. I cry every time I watch Hurt drink tea at Treves home with his wife. \n\nLikewise, Hurt uses a masterful nuance in portraying Merrick in The Elephant Man. His use of forlorn eyes and agonizing yells is as convincing in character as his pained growls and tear rending cries of suffering as he is beaten, mocked, and hurt. Hurt's acting is unparalleled in The Elephant Man.\n\nSimilarly, Sir Anthony Hopkins is outstanding in The Elephant Man. He endears the audience with an emotional honest rare to film. His character is complex as he originally feels he can reach medical fame for discovering Merrick's unthinkable condition, but experiences a profound change of heart as he gets to know Merrick. Hopkins is so nuanced like Hurt as he starts out stunned by Merrick's appearance, then sheds a single tear in sympathy for the man. His confession to his wife at night is acting at its most revealing. Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves with subtle skill and effortless empathy.\n\nFurthermore, The Elephant Man features several wonderful supporting performances. Anne Bancroft is lovely and kindly as the sympathetic actress Madge Kendall and friend to Merrick. John Gielgud is striking as the hospital's governor with his strict composure that softens into an understanding empathy for the misshapen Merrick as he imagines what Merrick must have endured. Wendy Hiller is steadfast as the head nurse Mrs. Mothershead, who cares for Merrick the only way she knows. Freddie Jones is monstrous as the raggedy abuser and Merrick's captor Mr. Bytes. Michael Elphick is likewise cruel as Merrick's next exploiter and abuser. Hannah Gordon is remarkably memorable and sympathetic as Dr. Treves' kind wife Ann Treves. Even Kenny Baker makes a brief cameo as Merrick's savior, who delivers stunning knowing parting words with Merrick.\n\nLastly, the score to The Elephant Man is a hybrid of eerie classical and contemporary compositions from composer John Morris. He complements the scary unspeakable abuse that Merrick endures, while capturing an enchanting sweetness during the few kind moments Merrick gets to experience.\n\nIn all The Elephant Man is a classic film noir, an informative historical biopic, and an empathetic journey into the painful life of Joseph Merrick with endearing excellent performances. Lynch has directed an enduring and fine film.",

What's odd is how, at other times, Lynch doesn't trust the audience to draw its own conclusions. Take the scene where Hopkins' Dr. Treves questions to himself whether he is a good or bad man for exposing Merrick to high society; this theme is his throughline, made apparent from the very first scene, where he's framed as a showman in the vein of the villainous Mr. Bytes. Even if its a bit blunt for Lynch, its still Lynch, and some outstanding filmmaking carries it on to finding real pathos in its final act.",

Excellent acting by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.  Beautifully done in black and white, so fitting for the Victorian setting.  An absolute classic on all levels - cinematography, acting, screenplay, direction, etc.  Has not lost its effect after all these years and likely will never feel dated.

A reminder that the director is not only a mastermind of the uncanny but of sincere sympathy. Lynch is deeply sympathetic with his character's struggles and he pushes aside self awareness with how expressing such a sympathy can be uncomfortable. It gives each of his movies, even Dune, an earnestness.\n\nLike Twin Peaks, Elephant Man seeks to enter into a person's inner life and force them to ask the question, \"Am I a good man, or a bad man?\" As well as reconsider how we see each other, compared to our impression of them. To question our own motives, before showing that we can only question for so long until we simply must give in to a hope that others are sincere.\n\nThe ending was moving because John Merrick's finished cathedral is something that we all want to give the world. A message in a bottle that tells others what is really in our heart.",

Alas, even after being recognized as a man of advanced intellect, Merrick is still treated like a freak; no matter his station in life, he will forever be a prisoner of his own malformed body. Unable to secure rights for the famous stage play The Elephant Man, producer Mel Brooks based his film on the memoirs of Frederick Treves and a much later account of Merrick's life by Ashley Montagu. The film is lensed in black and white by British master cinematographer Freddie Francis. Though nominated for eight Academy Awards, the film was ultimately shut out in every category.",

Hopkins and Bancroft also did well in their supporting roles.\n\nNext to Hurt's performance it was the photography here that is most admired and remembered. I love the choice to shoot in black and white and thought Lynch did an excellent job depicting the contrast between the seedy, grimy and industrial London Merrick came from with the delicately refined sector of London Society he was becoming a member of.\n\nThis is probably the most accessible of Lynch's films, exploring a universal theme that is relevant regardless of time and place.

This doesnt seem like a recommendation, but it is, this is a one of a kind movie that is a must watch for everyone, because this is probably the most special biographical film ever made. It's sad, emotional, and aggravating, yet beautiful and special. This movie makes you hate humanity, but love the humane.\nFrom the very first time you see John Merrick, you feel for him. On first hand he looks like a monster, but soon after you very easily are starting to feel for him, and everything that happens around him. This movie is a life lesson for everyone, it makes clear that the outside of a human being is just lifeless sack of flesh and skin surrounding an indestructible polished bright diamond, that is one's soul. \n\nThe best moment in the film is where John has been chased around the train station after being recognized as The Elephant Man, then forced into a corner by a hurd of people, John yells out with all of his power and will: ''I'm not a monster, I'm not an elephant, i'm a human being.... I am a MAN!'', this is the breaking point for every audience member, doesn't matter how tough you are, after everything you've witnessed alongside John and Frederick, you will cry.\nThis movie left me emotionally and physically wrecked after seeing it, and when a movie can achieve such a level of movement in me, it deserves its spot on my top 50\n\n(Note: After crying 3 times at the half way point of the movie, i lost count.)\n\nThe Elephant Man is a movie experience that's indescribable.",

As realized by a pre-Silence of the Lambs Anthony Hopkins and an unrecognizable John Hurt (sporting phenomenally realistic make-up by Christopher Tucker), this heartfelt story hits you beat for tender beat.\n\nIn this PG-rated bio-pic, a Victorian surgeon (Hopkins) rescues a heavily disfigured side-show freak (Hurt), only to discover that  behind the deformity  exists a man of great intelligence and sensitivity. \n\nFor his follow-up to the offbeat oddity Eraserhead, David Lynch thankfully mostly takes a straightforward approach, taking you by the hand and effortlessly walking you right into the hospitals and freak shows of Victorian London. Some of his indulgent nightmare sequences ring closer to in tone the surrealist moments of later successes Blue Velvet or Mulholland Drive, but these indiscretions dont entirely kill the drama. \n\nBottom line: Trunk Show Jewel",

As he is gradually more exposed to public life, the risk of torment comes back to haunt him as his Incurable looks constantly grab unwanted attention, which people are willing to pay and see. Based upon true events, this is a heart felt depiction of someone who only wanted to be treated as a human being, and not an animal, for the minimal time he had of life. The sadness of this story has really come across, bolstered by the fine array of well known acting talent on display, from the legendary Anthony Hopkins, to the unsavoury Michael Elphick. Albeit unrecognisable, The Lincoln educated John Hurt, who attended the same secondary school as me also plays a wonderful part.

If there was an award for this category at the time, this film would have surely won it. The music is also used effectively and will be familiar to many people who would have heard it outside the film. However, away from all the praise given already, I can not go without mentioning the cinematography. I believe it was a smart decision filming it in Black and White. With the Victorian era sets and the editing style, the movie had a feeling of being filmed during the time period it was set in. It is hard to see any of 1980 in it. This makes the message even more powerful as you feel yourself there with the characters. I feel this movie would not have worked as well if in colour.

It doesn't matter that much what really caused his condition, but how it affected him. The elephants attacking his mother are a representation of what was the arrival of such a child in his mother's life.

This was beautifully dealt with in the film, together with the uneasiness we feel when the \"hero\" starts to become more and more similar to the \"villain\", getting to the point of asking himself aloud whether he is a good man or a bad man.\nAlso, there is the behaviour of the night keeper, torturing Merrick once again when he finally feels safe. It is a vital moment of the story, when we are more likely to flinch at the sight of the night keeper's evil face than to Merrick's deformity. It makes us realise who the real monster is.",

Initially, he only displays him in a similar manner to his colleagues (he's a doctor), but after finding out that the man is intelligent he begins to care for him. The movie isn't quite easy to sit through, as you see the mental and physical abuse that John is put through. But for all the moments like that, there are many more touching moments that will put a smile on your face and/or a tear in your eye. I'll be honest, I cried on more than one occasion, and this has to be one of the most emotionally powerful movies I've ever seen. Family-friendly, has a great message and highly recommended for anyone.",

A beautiful portrait of a man so full of goodness yet surrounded with evil all around him. If you have a crappy day, no day will feel as bad as most of Merrick's life. Sentimental film with very moving scenes, to many to mention really. Hopkins is so great in this film, my favorite role from him I believe. He was not even nominated for best actor or supporting actor, and it's a shame that the film not got one single statuette.\n\nOne of the sadder films out there, yet filled with positive spirits -  this is touching stuff.

You will feel thoroughly disgusted at the likeness of the human being at most parts of this film; how they can treat one of their own kind in such a horrible manner. But you can seek approval in the acts of some. The few who took to kindness to what most called a beast will inspire. This movie boasts astounding performances all around, and the black and white era feel perfects an already wonderful film. The way they were able to transform John Hurt to Joseph (John) Merrick is amazing, he looks quite the spitting image, and Hurt portrays him in a truly great way, shining light on a magnificent man riddled with only love and happiness but receiving only terror and a constant reason to feel anything but the man he is. A great film that will leave you sad and in awe at its final moments, quite possibly in tears, and most definitely entertained at how your last 2 hours were spent.

David Lynch creates his trademark surreal atmosphere to depict this man's held in despair and the scrutiny he is constantly under. John Merrick is a normal man who has a terrible terminal deformity, and for that one reason alone, he is treated as inhumanely as possible; the story takes place in Victorian England, a very prim and proper time, however, everyone shows him no manners and speaks bluntly to him about his ugliness.  People just barge into his home, as if he has no right to privacy,  merely to taunt him and make money off of his unique appearance; this exemplifies the way others perceive him, they perceive him as an object, an animal who has no meaning in his life other than for monetary gain for them and their own self-amusement. Hopkins' character is dealing with this same struggle, he does not know whether he is doing these things for Merrick out of kindness,  or for his own career advancement and self-satisfaction. The screenplay for this film is one of the best of all time, it is so thorough in its examination of Merrick's daily and lifelong struggles, while it also creates characters that are so human it makes the film feel extremely authentic and makes the meditation that much more accurate.  You'd be hard pressed to find a film that is so well crafted in its study of the human condition. I definitely recommend a viewing of this film for all film buffs.",

There is nothing creative about you. The writing for the Elephant Man was made for the sole intention to tug at the heartstrings of the audience. It is an emotional roller coaster and really never gets that deep. It is also based on a true story and many different accounts of this phenomenon. I happen to love emotional movies because even though they aren't deep, never get too risky or try anything new, and basically only try to prey on the mind of the audience they are usually great stories and this is no exception. I felt so bad for the main character that I was intrigued from the minute I saw him. Anthony Hopkins does a great job as the doctor and his role was perfect. I loved it very much. I give absolutely no credit to David Lynch. Despite the fact that I thought the directing was perfectly fine, it was only that. Just fine. It added nothing to the story itself and in the parts where you can really see lynch shine through (the beginning and any of the parts where he showed a woman screaming shaking her head) it absolutely sucked. The start of the movie is prime time David Lynch arrogance. It is his \"creative\" nature tarnishing the first impression that I have of the film at which point Hurt and Hopkins save the day and my opinion of the movie. 9/10",

            "content": "I first saw this film many years ago and since then it's become quite iconic. There have been many comedy sketches based on the character of John Merrick (The Elephant Man in question); or rather John Hurt's superb portrayal I should say. There have also been several documentaries about the life of John Merrick and those that shaped his life. Needless to say I thought it about time I gave it another look when it appeared in the TV listings this week. Here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.\n\nJohn Merrick (John Hurt) is a man who has a disfiguring condition that leaves him at the whim of the unscrupulous. These include Bytes (Freddie Jones), who makes money by showing him off to the public as 'The Elephant Man'. But when surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) comes across him in a travelling show, he takes pity on him and takes him in. He lives at the hospital where Treves works, where he learns to speak and is soon turns out that he is actually quite intelligent. The head of the hospital, Carr Gomm (John Gielgud) agrees to let him stay and even see's off Bytes when he comes around looking for his 'golden goose'. Merrick continues to improve and even has visits from the great and the good; including actress, Mrs. Kendall (Anne Bancroft). But we haven't heard the last of Bytes quite yet, and with the unwitting assistance of the night porter (Michael Elphick), he gets back into the hospital... and it's on that cliff-hanger I'll leave it.\n\nFilmed entirely in black and white I found this quite an interesting take on John Merrick's story. Of course a lot of poetic license is used, but the essence of the man and his story are there. I have to admit I love John Hurt's performance; I can't imagine anyone else getting that much emotion through so many prosthetics! Of the other performers, I thought Freddie Jones as the side-show entrepreneur was excellent also. Over all, although it does have its faults, I did enjoy this one; it's quite poignant in places and you find yourself really touched by John Merrick; a little over-long, but well worth a look.\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 8.1/10",

            "content": "David Lynch's skill for brutal surrealism makes him the ideal director for The Elephant Man. \nThe surrealism used to tell the story of Joseph \"John\" Merrick is distinct of David Lynch's work and is rich with a mysterious sense to it, which really puts the theme of The Elephant Man into perspective. His direction of such a touching story is executed very well and makes the story multi-dimensional, so is undoubtably worthy of an Academy Award nomination.\nLike the majority of David Lynch's films, The Elephant Man is a twisted story, although only on the surface because as it dives into the depth John Merrick, we uncover a beautiful side to the man considered repulsive on the surface whose souls is right with passion and emotions are more human than many of the other's in the film. \nThe script helps all the actors understand the characters, and it does the same for the audience so that the viewers get a clear understanding of the story and embrace the heart of John Merrick as well as Frederick Treves for his empathetic actions. The actors make it all the more easy.\nJohn Hurt's performance as the titular Elephant Man Joseph \"John\" Merrick was great because along with the complex makeup, his performance worked alongside it to ensure the feel of the character was convincing, speaking though he had a serious deformity and following his prosthetic makeup with physical acting very well, and it has to be astoundingly difficult to act underneath that much costume and makeup, but if John Hurt can pull through, he deserves an Academy Award nomination for best actor, and he did and he received one.\nI also felt a nomination was deserved for Anthony Hopkins' fine performance. He wasn't faced with the challenge of acting through that much prosthetic makeup, but to have to play a character that stands out as one of the few to sympathise with a man treated as such an outcast by the rest of society. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his most kind and sentimental performance from before he gained a legacy as famous villain Hannibal Lecter, and he becomes all too separable thanks to his role in The Elephant Man, one rich with emotional power and humanity, one all too memorable even with the unforgettable lead from John Hurt. The Elephant Man features one of Anthony Hopkins' finest.\nJohn Gielgud and Anne Bancroft were also good in their respective roles.\nThe technical side of The ElephantMan Man is massively successful due to the decision to create a surreal and dark atmosphere with the Black and White visuals, and the way that sequences are edited excellently against the backdrop of a magnificent musical score and the famous piece that was later used in Platoon known as Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber, as well as a fine general score by John Morris.\nThe cinematography is also excellently put and keeps the audience level with the characters in the sense that it stays at their head-heights constantly so it's like the audience is witnessing everything from a first person perspective, which really sets the mood for the story greatly as well as the rest of the aforementioned technical achievements.\nBut the single finest one that also has the legacy for being the reason that Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling was created, and that's the prosthetic makeup used to convince the audience that the real John Merrick is present in the film. The makeup is almost shocking in how convincing it is, being brutally realistic and just absolutely excellent, the finest money can buy. The Elephant Man proves that 1980 was a breakthrough year for prosthetic makeup, and it really deserved an Academy Award for that.\n\nSo the simple and stylish tale of John Merrick is told very well by David Lynch and is technically appealing as well as finely acted.",

Anthony Hopkins is phenomenal as Frederick Treves a sympathetic doctor who tries to help Merrick. This is a superb film that showcases the kindness of the human nature.  This is a terrific drama that will certainly please cinema buffs. The acting of John Hurt is spectacular as John Merrick and considering how difficult his performances must have been, he definitely did deserve an Oscar of some kind. Unfortunately this stunning picture would only be nominated and come out empty handed. Everything about this film is beautiful, the cinematography immaculate, and the choice to shoot this in Black & White brings out the subtle qualities of this true story. David Lynch, who previously directed the surrealistic psychological horror film Eraserhead, crafts something unique with The Elephant Man, and he goes deep into the cruelty of humanity and also brings out the best in human nature as well. This is not a film for everyone, but if you're looking for a compelling real life drama, then give this one a shot. With Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt's performances alone, The Elephant Man stands as one of the best films of 1980's. This is filmmaking at its best and David Lynch has made his masterpiece with this one. With a strong cast and terrific storytelling, this is a marvelous film that is moving, poignant and simply unforgettable.",

            "content": "David Lynch has a talent of holding up a mirror. The audience is allowed or even forced to confront its own flaws, its numerous shortcomings. Yet the undertone is more often than not the one of hope, that we still have the chance to learn. Some could even claim that in some respect this film is educational. It certainly has a moral lesson. That pity rarely is the right answer, as it is nothing more than the grudging nod of a supposedly superior being towards a lesser man. Rather we should learn to respect and accepts others as equals, worthy of our time and their own individuality. It is a difficult lesson to teach without preaching or pointing fingers, but I rather think that this film accomplishes just that and it accomplishes it with beauty and grace.\n\nThe brilliance of using a character like John Merrick, played by John Hurt, is that he's such a shocking figure. And the movie plays with our expectations and our ingrained need to gawk and whisper. Our glimpses of Merrick are controlled and shrouded for a long time and when we finally see him it's such a sterile experience that we're forced to ask ourselves what all the fuss was about. And right after that Merrick starts to grow as a character and I honestly felt rather awful later on when I realized that I had immediately dismissed this man and his nature just because I had been so interested in how they had managed to make him look. It's a skillful trap and one that many will fall into, which helps to teach you the lesson.\n\nThough speaking of Merrick's appearance, I must commend the makeup department, as he really looks hideous. There's an immediate reaction of repulsion when you first lay eyes on him, even though the shot itself is such a sterile one. And that repulsion is of course the fact why the need to respect this man needs even to be taught. You absolutely wouldn't expect such a kind soul from a body like that, but as always, you cannot judge book by its covers. In this case ugliness only goes skin deep and in time I learned to greatly respect and even admire Merrick's character and his willingness to endure.\n\nA film with just Merrick in it would hardly be adequate, however. Thus I am glad that they managed to get someone like Anthony Hopkins to play the part of Frederick Treves as he is an important audience-surrogate. We feel and process our emotions provoked by this film by watching and learning from his reactions. The initial sick wonderment, the horror of realization, the misguided pity, the shame, the willingness to know better and the eventual respect. It is a staggering amount of emotions and subtle nuances to express, but Hopkins manages it with ease and aside from Merrick, his role is easily the most captivating in the entire film.\n\nI would however slightly criticize just how saint-like Merrick has been made in this film. In some ways it works for the film's favour as the lesson gets taught much better when the contrast is as clear as possible without being naive. But the real-life John Merrick - yes, this is based on real people and events - was by all accounts a man, he had his flaws. Not numerous, but flaws nonetheless. Merrick's only real flaw in this film would seem to be his inability to stand up for himself, which makes him more rounded and more identifiable - plus it helps with the pity - but it's still a minor issue, at least for me. Treves is also given a much nicer role to play in Merrick's life, while his initial \"handler\" is greatly vilified, but I can recognize that the film works much better this way rather than if the real-life events had been perfectly replicated.\n\nOn the technical side of things, this is a remarkably well-made film. The shots and settings have themes and ideas behind them, they're not just random shots of hospitals and the streets of London. The black and white aesthetic also works really well with the Victorian setting, plus I bet that it helps to disguise the rubbery texture of Merrick's face. The music and the pacing also work rather well, but it's the visual side where this film really shines, aside from the story of course.\n\nI admire this film. It doesn't feel like it's trying to force you to some conclusion or another. In retrospect you can of course see that you were guided, but it felt natural and I was allowed to draw my own conclusion. I had to gaze into my own person, my own soul, and allowed to decide whether or not I liked what I saw or not. And that's the strength of this film. It wants you to better yourselves, to show you that you still have some ways to go and that the society of today is not without any flaws. It's a beautiful film.",
