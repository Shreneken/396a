    "summary": "Tormented by guilt following the death of his older brother, Buck, in a sailing accident, alienated teenager Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton) attempts suicide. Returning home following an extended stay in a psychiatric hospital, Conrad tries to deal with his mental anguish and also reconnect with his mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), who has grown cold and angry, and his emotionally wounded father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland), with the help of his psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch).",

            "content": "The story and archs of every member of the family go in the exact direction that they should go. While it does have some 80s cheesiness that doesn't hold up a ton, it still felt genuine and real enough. The drama was brought out in certain scenes very well and I feel like this was a kind of prototype movie for what would become Goodwill Hunting. The son and father in particular shine in this movie and the son's and mother's relationship are fascinating (I especially thought so since I have members of my own family who reflect both of them in characteristics and how they choose to express themselves). Ultimately, it is a beautiful story about realizing oneself and acknowledging hard truths in life. It's a truly important movie and I'm glad that I heard about it from a mental health training seminar!",

The filmmaking itself is filled with sensitivity and warmth, from the sound right through to the colors of every scene. Well seated in its time with references to the famous extra martial hit of its day, Ordinary People is as relevant now; in world filled with grief and in a society where a great number of people consult a therapist.",

            "content": "(Spoilers) The bloom has come off the rose since 1980 when this was considered a shattering, incisive melodrama.  It's not as stunning now. \n(Teen suicide is no longer the issue du jour like it was in 80).  But as a drama it still works. \nThis is still quite a beautiful study of what one viewer called \"a particular species of American family.\" Oddly enough, this is really a love triangle; not in the romantic sense; in the familial sense; it's a battle in the sense of who will survive this trauma?  It's like a three way wrestling match: Who will survive the family trauma intact; and who will get beaten; and fall by the wayside.  How will this play out?  Credit the movie for not tacking on some predictable ending where Beth changes at the ending; hugs Conrad and apologizes and promises to be nicer.  We see that coming and yet it never does.  Judith Guest and Robert Redford allow for the messier ending when the greifstricken Beth walks out; aptly punished for her abusive behavior to Conrad.  But she is also probably facing a breakdown; which makes the whole thing trickier; and harder.  Echoes of Checkov and other epic family melodramas of the past abound.   Like Look Back in Anger; and the works of Arthur Miller; (All My Sons and Death of a Salesman); and Edward Albee (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf); or Woody Allen's 1978 family melodrama Interiors; with it's own tales of broken mothers and suicide which this movie closely resembles.  Also considered a remake in many ways of the 1936 Rosalind Russell melodrama Craig's Wife: where Rosalind plays Harriet Craig; a beautiful but pushy and materialistic housewife who withholds love from all the other people in her life; who self-destructs as the story progresses.  In spite of all this and because of all this Ordinary People is still great.  It's still a warmly intense; \n beautifully acted and written film; crisply directed by novice Robert Redford.  It's still arguably one of the best family dramas ever made.",

And like a movie I watched just before it, Kramer vs. Kramer (1979's Best Picture winner and this being 1980's winner), it is a tearjerker but not in a way that feels like its being manipulative, it handles its emotions in a realistic and compassionate way and its one of the most powerful dramas from the 1980's I've seen.",

            "content": "Robert Redford's directorial debut promptly won him the top prizes for Best Director and Best Picture at the 53rd Academy Awards in 1981. Until then, Redford had been known for his acting performances. He finally shook off his reputation as a pretty boy with Ordinary People. The film tells the story of the Jarrett family, shattered after the death of their eldest son and the subsequent suicide attempt of their youngest son, who try to deal with their grief in a variety of ways.\n\nTimothy Hutton won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the son Conrad, who has just been released from a mental institution, although he is actually the central character of the film. Especially at the beginning, he appears in almost every scene and the tragic events are told from his point of view. From the beginning, he has a hard time finding his way in his new, old life and you always have the feeling that he could fall off the wagon again. From a point where he realises he wants to get his life under control, his parents come to the fore. Donald Sutherland as father Calvin and Mary Tyler Moore as mother Beth could hardly be more different. Calvin is an eternal optimist who talks everything up even after such a tragic incident, but in reality is very worried about his stricken son and the family. Beth, on the other hand, is trapped in a bubble where she detaches herself from any emotional attachments and acts cold and emotionally unavailable towards Conrad in particular. The character is by no means a sympathetic one, but Moore's acting is so close to reality that you can relate to her perverted way of grieving and loving. Sutherland and Moore have the chemistry of a couple growing apart, as you see so often in real life. But the best chemistry in the film is between Hutton and Judd Hirsch as Conrad's therapist Dr Berger. Initially rather toxic, the internally broken Conrad confides more and more in his helper, whereupon a genuine friendship develops. The interplay between friend and psychotherapist seems relatable at all times due to Hirsch's authentic play of a tough but fair mentor.\n\nThe great strengths of Ordinary People are its outstanding cast and the realistically written script. The dialogue and sometimes monologues get to you and sometimes even have unexpected wit, which does the devastating plot good. For his first directorial effort, Redford has also shown a good hand. Instead of telling a melodramatic family drama in a suburb, he has chosen the subtle way and taken the necessary time for all essential characters. This tediousness also hurts the film, especially in the first half. It's hard to get into the story and the build-up seems tough, which means that the plot only affects you to a limited extent at the beginning. Towards the end this improves and the final act is as heartbreaking as the whole film, but is well and adequately chosen. Overall, Ordinary People is not a film that stands out nowadays, but for its time it was a hit in terms of realism, grief processing and family and group dynamics.",

            "content": "Ordinary People is not a particularly groundbreaking movie, nor as its title suggests does it set out to be one. It tells the lives of an affluent family in the wake of their teenage son's suicide attempt and repercussions of the death of their other son in an accident before that. The movie makes some unremarkable observations, but ones that society should be reminded of once in a while. Teenagers are awkward in their formative years. Teenagers try to distinguish their own preferences and it's made difficult given societal expectations from institutions, their family and their friends. Bad things happen to everyone regardless of whether they are rich or poor. People are affected by grief, guilt, regrets and loss in different ways and some people never recover from tragedies. Now, some viewers might find the movie plodding, but it is nice to see the nuances of different characters in different situations and Timothy Hutton does steal the show as a teenager that's ill at ease in the world. The more interesting insight that the movie delivers towards the end is that the reason why tragedies are so jarring is that individuals are forced to re-evaluate what is important in their lives. What they are doing and why they are doing it. This forced and unexpected change in perspective is psychological painful, because in order to deal with it requires the utmost honesty and to not do so is to invite anguish. It turns out that those that are affected by tragedy have to establish a new normal and this is done by recognizing that in order to 'regain control' one has to first and foremost keep restating one's personal feelings and aspirations which might or might not harmonize with those around you anymore, but will ultimately result in genuine and lasting connections as it has before.",

I think this movie is a tough one to watch but the performances across the board are outstanding. Timothy Hutton is the standout in the movie and it is no surprise he won an Oscar at an early age for this film. His performance is raw and devastating and despite what the Oscars might have you believe, is the lead performance and the heart and soul of this movie. The movie has a surprising ending in that,t not every character learns a lesson, and that felt very true to how real life can be sometimes.

The film follows the Jarrett Family: the father Calvin (Donald Sutherland), the mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), and son Conrad (Timothy Hutton). Conrad emotionally distances himself from the family due to his younger brother's death from a boating accident and visits a psychiatrist Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch). On the opposite spectrum, Calvin is emotionally shut down, flowing passively through Beth's tunnel. Meanwhile, Beth represses the memory of her son, thereby burying it and controlling every aspect of the Barrett Family. The significance of Robert Redford's directorial debut is the emotional turmoil buried being masked by the happy autumn red societal merit, becoming ordinary people. Both Calvin and Conrad must let out their rage and treasure the memories by seeking help from an outside source. Beth, resenting any change and taking the wrong route, buries the treasure by cleaning the house, frequently going on trips and sending Conrad to a mental hospital. As Calvin finally confronts Beth about his feelings, she secretly leaves him and flies to Houston, again, distancing away from her hang-ups. Ordinary People truly is one of the finest and powerful family dramas about survivor's guilt and identity crisis in the last forty years. \n\n(4 \u00bd French Toasts out of 5)",

The film overall takes a premise that seems like it sprang from the mind of a first-year film student, but treats it with a degree of complexity that really makes it feel sincere. That's not to say that Ordinary People doesn't stray into territory where it seems to provide license for excessive performances that feel less like the result of a pot boiling over, but like a sporadic exhibition of acting capability; it certainly does, particularly in the latter half.

He outshines Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore who are fine as his parents. Its a powerful story and we slowly get to know what happened to Conrad as we delve into his mind through his regular meetings with his father. It take a lot for him to open up and admit the only one thing he did wrong was surviving. Its not a perfect film by any means, i never fully feel Sutherland and Moore totally convince. There is patience to be hard for watching and listening. Some may find it bores and it did feel some elements did. The relationships is where the film shines. With parents, with friends and even watching his parents try and act normal with their friends. Conrad will always blame himself and can't open up to people so becomes more introvert.  Many people can relate to this. Moore's character is very harsh and very cold. Has she lost love once her son died? She doesn't want to talk about things, she hides. Sutherland's character does not know what to do right with both his son and wife. Always feeling like his is doing something wrong. The ending was something that could have been enhanced, the wife leaves but doesn't say anything to her husband. I wanted them to talk, i wanted them to have some resolve, ultimately i feel disappointed. There are many powerful scenes, from the Doctor and Conrad finally getting to the important elements, and Conrad finally expecting being hungry for breakfast.

Tommy Hutton earns every bit of the praise he received for his role as Conrad, a teen transformed by grief and his inability to come to terms with the tragedy which shook his family to the core. It's a performance that's very intimate and close, with lots of subtle ticks and gestures. Nothing in the film feels overblown or hammy, yet its never dull or lacking in urgency. It's a window into the lives of those who care only for outward appearances; those who will do anything to hide the shame and disappointment they truly feel. Its influences can be seen in movies such as American Beauty and Good Will Hunting, the former for its depiction of families falling apart behind the scenes, and the latter for its sympathetic portrayal of psychologists, who were usually relegated to secondary bad guy roles at the time. Judd Hirsch encourages our hero to forgive himself and accept the past for what it is, and the scenes with Hirsch and Hutton carry the heaviest emotions, as well as the best acting. It might seem dated, superficial and cliched by modern standards, but 40 years ago elements like this were rarely seen, so they're only cliched because people used them so much. If you're a fan of heavy drama, Ordinary People is a film I'd highly recommend.",

            "content": "Robert Redford's 1980 directorial debut Ordinary People is a powerful character study about a family dealing with grief. The film's title tells the audience what to expect, a film about ordinary people who normally live ordinary lives, assuming that one considers ordinary people to be white, upper-middle-class Americans who live in the suburbs. Whatever the audience's own background however, it isn't hard to empathise with the film's characters.\nThe simple story concerns the Jarrett family, whose members are trying to cope following the death of eldest son Buck and subsequent attempted suicide of younger son Conrad. This back story is revealed through the dialogue and occasional flashback as the plot focalises through Conrad and his personal journey throughout the movie. The film's great strength is the believability of is central characters, chiefly Calvin and Beth and their son, but also psychiatrist Dr Berger as well as the Jarretts' various friends, all of whom act realistically awkwardly towards the grieving family.\nAlvin Sargent's screenplay \u2013 based on Judith Guest's novel of the same name \u2013 is masterfully written, teasing out the conflicting and often suppressed emotions of the characters with complete plausibility. It is the acting however that really brings the story to life. Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore and Timothy Hutton are effortlessly convincing as Calvin, Beth and Conrad, each struggling in his or her own to way to come to terms with what has happened to their family. Hutton is especially impressive as the traumatised Conrad, through whom the film is focalised. His naturalistic performance resulted in him becoming the youngest ever actor to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He's remarkable throughout, but never more so than when he finally has a cathartic session with Berger and admits that he blames himself for Buck's death and is angry at him at the same time. The contrast between Conrad and his friend Karen is interesting \u2013 he tells her he misses things about the psychiatric hospital, whereas she claims she does not and with forced cheeriness insists that she is alright. She ends up committing suicide, in contrast to Conrad, who comes to terms with his grief and loss.\nDonald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore are equally impressive. Sutherland conveys Calvin's desperate desire for his son to be all right and for his family to pull through, before ultimately realising and accepting that his marriage is coming to an end. The party scene and its immediate aftermath are striking: Buck's death is the elephant in the room, and Beth is furious when Calvin tells one of their friends that Conrad is seeing a psychiatrist, resenting any intrusion into her fiercely guarded privacy. Moore's emotionally brittle performance reaches its zenith during the golf-course argument before culminating in her final scene with Sutherland, as Beth is confronted with her own emotional distance and chooses to simply walk away. Judd Hirsh meanwhile is perfectly cast as psychiatrist Tyrone C. Berger, a great character who gradually earns Conrad's trust and is consistently supportive without being judgemental.\nBehind the camera for the first time, Redford realises that the character-led plot doesn't require flashy direction, but rather solid, clear film-making that gives the actors and the material space to breathe. Cinematographer John Bailey uses shots that frame the actors in ways that reflect the emotional distance between them, for example during a scene in which the family has dinner and makes banal small-talk. The more dynamically shot scene of Buck's death is only ever glimpsed briefly in flashback, making it all the more powerful whenever Conrad remembers, as it intrudes into his memories however much he would rather it didn't. Ordinary People makes an elegant first feature for Redford, and its strength lies in his admirably low-key, intimate approach and the talent of the cast and crew he assembled.",

Perhaps because I was so young, I didn't really get the film entirely then.  But, now, after being married and having matured, I see \"Ordinary People\" not so much just a film about a family dealing with a tragedy.  But, more, it's a snapshot of a dysfunctional American family. Sutherland's character (Calvin) indicates several times during the movie that there were problems before Buck died.  Like a glass bottle that had fractures before, Buck's death shatters them into pieces.  And, while the family tries to maintain the same appearance as the happy \"normal\" suburban family after his death, they never really were \"happy\" in the sense as they ever tried to portray it.  With Buck gone, all the layers of the onion are peeled back and now there is no escaping what the family really is - dysfunctional, disjointed and not happy.  They cannot escape the truth anymore.  Also, I like how we see the varying degrees of personalities and how they handle adversity:  Beth is incapable of flexibility and will not face the fact that there could be issues; Her son Conrad is a mess and tried to commit suicide; Her husband Calvin is somewhere in between - trying to keep up the facade for her sake, but hurting and trying to go about life while seeking help from professionals.  A great film that wears well.  I hope the younger generation of fans make a point to see it.  You can't help but be touched by it.  A+",

            "content": "Fractured families have always been a favorite subject of mine when it comes to literature and film and this is considered one of the best family dramas of the 1980s. The two other films that Robert Redford has directed that I've seen, Quiz Show (1994) and A River Runs Through It (1992), were both fantastic and managed to explore tenuous family dynamics in detail. The reputation of this film as a Best Picture winner seemed to be negative because Raging Bull (1980) was released in the same year and was also nominated for Best Picture. Personally, having seen both films, I preferred this one but I know that's just personal taste because I was more interested in the themes explored in this movie than I was in the brother relationship in Raging Bull.\n\nConrad Jarrett, Timothy Hutton, has survived a recent suicide attempt but struggles to adjust to everyday life as he is traumatized by memories of his brother Buck's death and comes into conflict with his mother Beth, Mary Tyler Moore. Beth is obsessed with keeping up appearances and refuses to discuss Buck's death even as Conrad begins attending therapy sessions with Berger, Judd Hirsch, that help him tackle some of his guilt about his brother's death. The relationship between Beth and Calvin Jarrett, Donald Sutherland, suffers under the weight of their differences in parenting Conrad and Beth's refusal to express her emotions.\n\nThe majority of the film is just tense conversations between family members, friends and patients and psychiatrists but it was so compelling and so well acted that it was more engaging than any thriller moving at a breakneck speed. Alvin Sargent adapts Judith Guest's novel of the same name judiciously as he cuts out unnecessary subplots and leaves enough unspoken between family members for the dialogue to seem lyrical but natural. Redford has the ability to draw the characters clearly and gives all of his actors opportunities to do some of their best work. Scenes like Conrad and Jeanine, Elizabeth McGovern, having their first date and engaging in an uncomfortable conversation about his suicide attempt feel true to life and like an honest depiction of the strange moments that would occur in the life of a teenager who had made a suicide attempt.\n\nThe performances stand out as each actor seems to have crafted a character full of life with a rich backstory that informs their treatment of those around them. Moore received an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination for her shock performance as a cold, emotionally distant mother and wife who chooses to abandon her family instead of facing her pain. She is terrific as an icy woman whose put together appearance is clearly a fa\u00c3\u00a7ade for the damaged woman lying underneath and her refusal to admit this is at once infuriating and sympathetic. Sutherland would have absolutely been deserving of a Best Actor nomination although nobody would have beaten Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta. In his final scenes Sutherland plays a man who is wistful for what he once had but has accepted the fact that he needs to move on and tries his hardest to support his son.\n\nHutton won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, although he is the lead actor in this film, and he does show inner torment with relatively little dialogue and subtle facial expressions. One performance that surprised me was that of McGovern as I didn't like her in Once Upon a Time in America (1984) and was confused by her Best Supporting Actress nomination for Ragtime (1981) but here she is very good as the girlfriend. The date scene allows her to play confident and charming but also uncomfortable and awkward as her reactions to Hutton's provocations seem like those of a regular teenager. Hirsch was decent as the intelligent, probing psychiatrist but he hardly warranted any awards attention.\n\nThis is a great film that takes a story that could easily be too dark or difficult for most directors to adapt but Redford's touch makes the film watchable even as it is depressing. The performances are stellar with Moore and Sutherland really shining and the themes of the film serve as a nice follow-up to the previous year's Best Picture winner Kramer vs. Kramer (1979).",

I think it's genius because it's ironic. All these people watching the couple interact as if life were one big sitcom and then they're real lives are probably one big mess. It's the very thing that everyone wished they had in a relationship. And the icing on the cake is Donald Sutherland's character finds it so boring and not amusing that he's sleeping throughout the play. \n\nThere's this almost impalpable feeling in the air during this movie that anytime Conrad could kill himself or something awful will happen to him. There's a certain tension throughout. Depression and uncertainty are a really dangerous combination and this movie does a great job at highlighting that. You can clearly see that the main problem comes from the mother and how distant she is. You can tell that her first son's passing away really affected her. It's like she's trying to ignore what's really going on without really confronting what she's really feeling. \n\nIt's interesting to see how the characters interact with one another. especially in the scene where Conrad scares his mom when he gets home and she's in the room of her deceased son. The acting is phenomenal because you get to see just how awkward and socially inadequate the other and son relationship is. It seems like Jared just wished his parents, especially his mom, would just show him some love. \n\nIt's almost painful to watch how much Conrad is trying to make an effort to connect with his mom but she's just so distant and almost brushes everything to the side. Things start to lighten up once Jeanine comes into the picture. It's really interesting to see how as everyone starts going to the psychiatrist, they start to figure out there problems. I really like Dr. Berger's way of how he approaches helping people. It's as if he talks to them like they were friends. All the guys are getting there problems dealt with when it's really Beth, the mother, who needs it the most. It's almost like she goes through life and the way she communicates is like the play that they were watching at the beginning, almost like a sitcom. \n\nWow, you imagine feeling guilty of your brother's death. That would eat up anyone on the inside. Wow, Beth really pissed me off even in the end. One of the most realest movies I've seen in a while. It didn't even have that happy of an ending. I really hope Beth learns something along with her departure, that emotionless bitch. \n\nThis movie did a brilliant job at storytelling, really great writing from whoever wrote it. It's a very real take on something that I feel everyone goes through which is what makes it such a great movie, everyone can relate to it.\n\nReally really brilliant movie with phenomenal acting!",

            "content": "In a film that has all the makings of the standard coming-of-age drama, Ordinary People tackles sensitive subject matter with poise and a rewarding sentiment.\nMainly following the life of Conrad Jarrett (a powerTimothy Hutton), we watch a a regular, suburban family adjust to normal life after the death of one of their children. We are introduced to a seemingly normal, functioning family with Conrad at its focal point, from the audience's view at least. He engages in normal teenage activities: he rides to school in the backseat of his rowdy friends car, attends swim practice, and goes home to eat dinner with his pristine mother (Mary Tyler Moore) and his soft-spoken father (Donald Sutherland). All seems right on the surface but the film's uneasy tone never wavers as the frailties of the family slowly begins to unfold.\nThe film moves at a somewhat leisurely pace but it is never tiresome. In fact is effortless and allows each character to reveal their intricacies without bombarding the viewer.\nThe film deals with tragedy and suicide with care, and does not dwell on melodramatic expose. Each character's insecurity is hinted at but it is never too explicit where the audience need not discover it for themselves. Redford allows the viewer to empathize with each character by their own notion and presents the events in a way that shows without telling.\nMuch of these emotions and complexities are drawn out by a family psychologist Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch) who operates with a calmness and assurance that couples well with Hutton's performance. Hirsch does a marvelous job here as the seasoned doctor who meets with Conrad and evokes his true emotions about his brother's death not by textbook questions but by establishment of trust and transparency. Hirsch and Hutton work well here and the dialogue is natural and effortless, reminds me of a young Matt Damon and Robin Williams conversing in a similar setting in Good Will Hunting. \nAnother couple that work well together with matching acting prowess is Tyler Moore and Sutherland. Playing the dichotomous couple who battle between acceptance and catharsis in the face of the tragedy, both actors nail their roles as the conscientious mother who struggles to create an intimacy with her son, and the quiet, agreeable father who attempts to find a common ground between the two polarized members of his family, respectively. Tyler Moore is unforgiving and tragic in her own sense as later scenes in the movie reveal but the film never leans in her favor. Alvin Sargent and Nancy Dowd, who wrote the screenplay, never neglect to give each character their own light and allows each character to operate effectively in separate scenes. \nHowever, the best scenes in the movie I think involve the supporting characters. the most revealing instances are between Conrad and his two female interests. It's here we are able to connect with Conrad and get a real feel for his pain. One scene has Conrad meeting with his friend from the psychiatric hospital Karen (Dinah Manoff) and they share the details of their life after their encounter. We can see Conrad's struggle discern his own condition in comparison to Karen's. We can see for ourselves the insincerity of his upbeat attitude and his attempt at normality. Director Robert Redford helps bring vibrancy to the film and we see a part of the story develop rather than unfold. It's at these moments we understand the struggle Conrad face's with his own emotional turmoil and we can see his only two connections with happiness left; although one character embodies happiness in the past, the other in the future. \nAt the beginning and end, a version of Pachelbel's Canon rings out; a beautiful, grand composition that works as a synecdoche. To dip into musical terms, Pachelbel utilizes counterpoint, or a feature of music where every section plays their own tune at different times, yet the entirety of the piece sounds in harmony. It's a nice testament to the film, where each roles resonates solo and fortissimo, anchored by the unwavering performances of the cast. Yet the true genius of the film does not just lie in the players, but by the sure-handed direction of Robert Redford in his extraordinary debut.",

Even though its shown from the perspective of white middle and upper middle class characters, the realistic portrayal of how the withholding, denial, and repression of emotions and thoughts can effect families has universal relevance. It also offers keen insight into how our society processes death in all forms and why simply opening up ourselves to the ones we love can be so hard. Those familiar with Mary Tyler Moore only as a perky sitcom actress will have difficulty recognizing the ice cold loveless mother she portrays here. A young Timothy Hutton is wonderful as a teenage boy coping with the tragic death of his older brother, and Donald Sutherland is excellent playing a father who uses blinders to shut out the slow disintegration of his family.",

But when you really break it down and watch these wonderful actors giving excellent performances, Robert Redford providing some very subtle direction, and this story of tragedy and recovery moving along so naturally, you may just reconsider that notion. In short, Ordinary People is a grim and heartbreaking examination of some very unordinary people trying their very damn best to be ordinary. Every performance is fantastic, every shot is masterfully crafted, and the themes explored are tastefully done while still unrelenting. Perfect.",

A teenager (Timothy Hutton) feels guilt and blames himself for his brothers death which occurred during a boating accident. The father of the family (Sutherland) does his best to keep his son's health in his best interest and to keep the family together. As Sutton seeks therapy with a psychiatrist (Judd Hirsch) he discovers himself and struggles to get better. As the film progresses the characters really unfold and you see them for who they truly are. Redford masterfully directs this in a such a manner that shows you how different people react to tragedy. Some people might not like this film due to inability to relate to the characters, or have not had such a tragedy in their own lives, but anyone that has will really relate to this film. Mary Tyler Moore does an excellent job as the mother as well. Tragedy can have such diverse effects on somebody, but its a part of life and this film captures how it can make us stronger or really expose your true character.",

            "content": "Ordinary People is one of those Best Picture winners that gets a bad rap. It's easy to write the film off because it's a simple, though powerful, vision, and it went up against one of the most highly regarded films ever (Raging Bull). But you can't, or at least shouldn't, completely ignore a film this good. It's complex and moving, but not in an overly sentimental way. For the 90% of the film, Robert Redford (in his directorial debut, nonetheless) doesn't let his characters take the easy way out. The raw emotions on hand feel real because they are complicated. The ending feels like a cop out, which brought the film down just a bit, but the rest of the film and its strong performances more than make up for it.\n\nThe film begins about a six months after the Jarrett Family has been brought to its knees when Buck, the elder of two Jarrett siblings, died in a boating accident, and shortly thereafter, the younger brother, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), tried to commit suicide. After a lengthy stint in the hospital, Conrad still hasn't fully recovered and is still haunted by dreams of the accident. His parents, on the other hand, aren't quite sure how to handle him. His mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), is very cold toward him. His father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland), simply wants to return things to normal.\n\nOrdinary People isn't all that different from films like Rabbit Hole or In the Bedroom. Its characters are all complex, as are the emotions they are dealing with (or in some cases, not dealing with). Easily the most vivid character is Conrad. He definitely has a lot of issues he's dealing with (in the film, he regularly visits a therapist played by Judd Hirsch), and the way struggles with them directly drives the plot. Despite what the Academy declared (Hutton inexplicably was nominated for and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), Ordinary People is Conrad's story.\n\nWhere the film has a problem is with its ending. To be fair, there's only so much you can do when your source material is a beloved novel, but what happens with this film's ending is that it loses sight of just whose story this is. It simplifies things in the hope of providing a pat resolution for those we sympathize with. And worst of all, it completely disposes of one vital character. What happens to this character is a shame, for her or she (don't want to spoil it) provided the film with much of its complexity. I wish the film ended more strongly, for it definitely could have been a four-star picture.\n\nThe film is an acting showcase. Timothy Hutton's Oscar was well-deserved. I adored the way Conrad wears his emotion on his sleeves, and the fusion of intensity and vulnerability within the character commands your attention whenever he's onscreen (which is for most of the film). Mary Tyler Moore is astonishingly good as the mother from hell. She genuinely doesn't care for her son, and she repeatedly forces her husband to choose between her and Conrad. She's a character who typically would be sympathetic (suffering mother who has undergone a tragedy), but Moore makes her seem downright despicable. Finally, there's Donald Sutherland, who's the good guy in the bunch. He just wants to bring everyone he loves back together, and he struggles admitting to himself that it might just not be possible.\n\nOrdinary People's Best Picture win is typically not looked upon with great favor, but compared to many of its fellow 1980s winners, it's a triumph. The film is emotionally honest and I was pleased by how often it restrains itself. There are a few moments of over-direction, as well as a weak ending, but on the whole, it's a worthy motion picture that deserves more praise than it typically receives.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/ordinary-people-review/",

            "content": "In a film that has all the makings of the standard coming-of-age drama, Ordinary People tackles sensitive subject matter with poise and a rewarding sentiment.\nMainly following the life of Conrad Jarrett (a powerTimothy Hutton), we watch a a regular, suburban family adjust to normal life after the death of one of their children. We are introduced to a seemingly normal, functioning family with Conrad at its focal point, from the audience's view at least. He engages in normal teenage activities: he rides to school in the backseat of his rowdy friends car, attends swim practice, and goes home to eat dinner with his pristine mother (Mary Tyler Moore) and his soft-spoken father (Donald Sutherland). All seems right on the surface but the film's uneasy tone never wavers as the frailties of the family slowly begins to unfold.\nThe film moves at a somewhat leisurely pace but it is never tiresome. In fact is effortless and allows each character to reveal their intricacies without bombarding the viewer.\nThe film deals with tragedy and suicide with care, and does not dwell on melodramatic expose. Each character's insecurity is hinted at but it is never too explicit where the audience need not discover it for themselves. Redford allows the viewer to empathize with each character by their own notion and presents the events in a way that shows without telling.\nMuch of these emotions and complexities are drawn out by a family psychologist Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch) who operates with a calmness and assurance that couples well with Hutton's performance. Hirsch does a marvelous job here as the seasoned doctor who meets with Conrad and evokes his true emotions about his brother's death not by textbook questions but by establishment of trust and transparency. Hirsch and Hutton work well here and the dialogue is natural and effortless, reminds me of a young Matt Damon and Robin Williams conversing in a similar setting in Good Will Hunting. \nAnother couple that work well together with matching acting prowess is Tyler Moore and Sutherland. Playing the dichotomous couple who battle between acceptance and catharsis in the face of the tragedy, both actors nail their roles as the conscientious mother who struggles to create an intimacy with her son, and the quiet, agreeable father who attempts to find a common ground between the two polarized members of his family, respectively. Tyler Moore is unforgiving and tragic in her own sense as later scenes in the movie reveal but the film never leans in her favor. Alvin Sargent and Nancy Dowd, who wrote the screenplay, never neglect to give each character their own light and allows each character to operate effectively in separate scenes. \nHowever, the best scenes in the movie I think involve the supporting characters. the most revealing instances are between Conrad and his two female interests. It's here we are able to connect with Conrad and get a real feel for his pain. One scene has Conrad meeting with his friend from the psychiatric hospital Karen (Dinah Manoff) and they share the details of their life after their encounter. We can see Conrad's struggle discern his own condition in comparison to Karen's. We can see for ourselves the insincerity of his upbeat attitude and his attempt at normality. Director Robert Redford helps bring vibrancy to the film and we see a part of the story develop rather than unfold. It's at these moments we understand the struggle Conrad face's with his own emotional turmoil and we can see his only two connections with happiness left; although one character embodies happiness in the past, the other in the future. \nAt the beginning and end, a version of Pachelbel's Canon rings out; a beautiful, grand composition that works as a synecdoche. To dip into musical terms, Pachelbel utilizes counterpoint, or a feature of music where every section plays their own tune at different times, yet the entirety of the piece sounds in harmony. It's a nice testament to the film, where each roles resonates solo and fortissimo, anchored by the unwavering performances of the cast. Yet the true genius of the film does not just lie in the players, but by the sure-handed direction of Robert Redford in his extraordinary debut.",

Alvin Sargent's script only falls into cliche in the way Judd Hirsch's character interacts with the suicidal teen. The skill of both Hirsch and Timothy Hutton rise above that and make it feel painfully realistic. Redford's film is often surprisingly restrained, tightly edited and utilizes John Bailey's exceptional cinematography enough to prevent the movie from falling into a sort of soap opera. But the truly magical aspect of this film's core is Mary Tyler Moore's performance as the mother/wife. Her performance is so brittle and yet uncomfortably realistic -- it often feels too intimate. The incredibly effective and intensely disconnected on-screen chemistry she and Hutton create is so brutal it can be hard to watch. With well over 30 years hindsight is interesting that Mary Tyler Moore never again managed to do what she did here again. It is one of Robert Redford's major feats that he was able to so subvert such a cultivated cultural iconic persona to such potently uncharted waters capturing such a sad and all too realistic depiction of a seemingly permanently damaged maternal relationship without making us hate her. We can't fully understand her struggle, but we can empathize. Despite its dismissal by the film elite -- this movie is uniquely masterful and so much more than a tear-jerker. And, Sutherland plays his role so well --- his character's helpless ability to understand either his son or his wife almost makes his character unforgettably disconnected to point of being invisible.

            "content": "\"I've seen all ordinary people turn their heads each day! So satisfied, I'm on my way!\" I'm not going to reference the John Legend song that is actually titled \"Ordinary People\", nor am I going to reference the more fitting song of the same name by \"The Kinks\", because I think everyone would kind of like to forget about the \"Soap Opera\" album. Man, as weird-looking as Mary Tyler Moore looks now, and as weird-looking as Donald Sutherland and Judd Hirsch have always been, I don't know how ordinary these people are. Not even the film's director looks like an ordinary person, although, outside of Hollywood, you might be more likely to find people who look as funny as the leads sooner than someone who looks as pretty as Robert Redford, which would explain why Redford chose to hide behind the camera with this film. Seriously though, I'd say that this was a pretty successful debut for Redford as a director, although, in all fairness, we are talking about Robert Redford, and in 1980, everyone was still on a high for films about brutal family dysfunction from \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", so of course the Oscars dug it. It helps that the film is actually good, at least about as much as it can be, even with its natural shortcomings.\n\nThough plenty interesting, this film's subject matter is relatively simple, with certain major characters whose intrigue is not truly realized until they really find their place into a tale of dysfunction which has only so much momentum and extensive consequentiality, and isn't even unique. I joke about this being some sort of an answer to \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", but this film takes from a lot of distinguished dramatic properties in its vein and time frame, being almost hopelessly predictable, particularly when it goes so deep into formula that it loses subtlety. The subtlety lapses are rare, and hardly considerable once they do fall into play, but whether they be within some theatrical writing, or within obvious imagery, they stand overemphasizing ambitious themes, at least until Robert Redford's direction overcompensates for the dramatic missteps. As a matter of fact, I don't know if extremes to the directorial thoughtfulness so much overcompensate for the subtlety issues, as much as the subtlety issues break up overly subdued direction, whose consistency begets flat style and sober atmosphere that gets fairly dull upon find a point in storytelling in which material really falls out. I've already dealt with how simple this story is in a lot of ways, so, naturally, the runtime of over two hours is a little questionable achieved through a whole lot of inconsequential, or at least meandering material whose excessiveness is stressed by its getting to be just plain repetitious, if not monotonous after a while. The film takes so long to get its points, losing a sense of progression that more it circles around a formulaic and relatively simple path in a limp manner that wears you down, almost to the point of driving the final product into underwhelminginess. The film would have made that descent if all of the meanderings weren't punctuated so sharply by solid heights in storytelling which shine a light on just how worthy this drama's subject matter is.\n\nThe film's story concept is familiar and rather straightforward in its dramatic momentum, but the themes of this drama are of great importance, focusing on how terrible of an impact a tragic event can have on a family and its individual members, on an emotional and cerebral level that is by no means as ordinary as the victims of these personal turmoils supposedly are. Considering the subtlety and intimacy of this drama, a lot of the effectiveness rests on the shoulders of screenwriter Alvin Sargent, whose script is rather monotonous in its dramatic and structural excessiveness, but clever enough to carry respectable grace, and a degree of subtlety with it, which humanizes thorough characterization and dramatic scene structuring as genuine. Sargent's script is tasteful and obviously inspired, yet it, quite frankly, is not especially remarkable, with Robert Redford's direction seeming a bit more inspired, even if it's debatable whether or not it has more flare. There's not much style to Redford's debut directorial performance, hardly ever even utilizing a score to liven up the thoughtfulness which all too often dulls down momentum that cannot afford to fall too much, - considering the natural shortcomings of the story and the monotony of the written storytelling - but goes pretty deep when it does hit, breaking up a few obvious visuals with genuine subtlety that ranges from tenderly engrossing to piercing. Those subtlety touches go a long way, not simply in establishing powerful highlights in this audacious, brutally realist drama, but in transcending natural and consequential shortcomings enough to resonate with real, honest emotion, and tight intimacy that, as one can imagine, largely thrives on the performances. If nothing manages to save this film as compelling, then it is the cast, and even then, the thinness of the drama results in a thinness in acting material, made up for in the case of Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore through electric charisma and chemistry, punctuated by glowing dramatic highlights that are more recurrent in the lead performance of the then-up-and-coming Timothy Hutton, whose quiet, but powerfully convincing portrayal of a depressed young man seeking peace of mind over traumatic situations, and settle ground with loved ones, is the true heart and soul of this subdued drama. These gifted talents truly bring life to the impact of this film, whose subtlety could have meant its downfall, but is largely realized enough to make an adequately compelling and often powerful final product.\n\nBottom line, the simplicity of the story is stressed by clich\u00e9s, a few lapses in subtlety, a number of bland spots in direction, and dragging to storytelling, thus, the final product runs a strong risk of collapsing into underwhelmingness, transcended through the important themes, extensive scripting, heartfelt direction, and strong performances - the strongest of which being by Timothy Hutton - which secure Robert Redford's \"Ordinary People\" as an ultimately rewardingly sound study on the struggles of dysfunction and facing harsh realities about what can happen to good people.\n\n3/5 - Good",

Not only does it tell the suffering of a privileged family trying to paint a perfect, disingenuously stiff picture of a \"normal\" household, but also the sufferings an everyday human being may encounter.\n\n   Ordinary People is about the Jaretts. They are printed as this wealthy, standard and ideal family living an \"American Dream\". This was something people wanted in the seventies and eighties that was difficult to achieve and now it is more common. Calvin and Beth are the heads of the family while Conrad and Buck are their sons. One of them was the favorite and the other was underappreciated. In a matter of sudden tragedy, Buck dies when he drowns in Lake Michigan. \n\n   Conrad was with him that day trying to save him, giving him an intense set of grief and trauma, which leads to a probable PTSD. After the death of his idolized brother, Conrad is suicidal and depressed, can't help but thinking he should have been the one that lost his life. Worst of all, his parents, Beth in particular, doesn't give him support of discarding that belief but virtually, yet unintentionally encourage it. It is clear that Beth loves her son but one can tell that she adored and was proud of Buck, expressing conflicting matches with Conrad and that reveals her bitterness and how she deals with a parent's worse nightmare.\n\n  Calvin on the other hand is passive, seeming to be in the middle of his wife and son. As the head of the household, on what the husband should do according to fixed mindset of the seventies, fathers and husbands are not supposed to express grief or emotions period. They are \"supposed\" to protect the family. With his other son's death, Calvin feels like he failed ultimately as a protector and as a father. He doesn't show it right away, though. He doesn't know how to deal with the effects of a death because the Jaretts are so busy trying to look like shiny gold to others that they are actually disintegrating their family.\n\n  Moore plays a hardened, bitter part that is disliked as a character but audiences, especially women that have been in Beth's shoes, feel empathy for her. It is a great role for her. Sutherland is also spectacular in Calvin's submissive behavior. He creates a fine, quiet portrayal as a stuck husband and father. But it is Hutton who breaks the ice. He gives such a raw and emotionally devastating performance, not only capturing the mental illness and emotions, but embodying Conrad's humanity. He deserved the Oscar, though he was the lead, I guess Sutherland and Moore were more famous and were top billed and Robert De Niro's stupendous turn in Raging Bull would have hurt Hutton's chances.\n\n  Robert Redford is another extraordinary aspect of the film. He takes careful consideration and rich emotion that he draws you into the movie with such grace that gave him the Oscar for Best Director.\n\n Ordinary People also won Best Picture, though many people were bitter that Raging Bull was \"robbed\", I would have also chosen Ordinary People. Raging Bull deserved the award as well, but Ordinary People hits right at home with people forced to deal with this heavy reality.",

            "content": "Most people who watch \"Ordinary People\" today, 35 years on, surely do so because they're Oscar completists. For most people making their way through the list, it's probably one of the last Best Picture winners they make themselves sit down and watch. It's acquired an unfortunate reputation as being one of the Academy's \"mistakes,\" since it beat the more stylistically-challenging \"Raging Bull.\" The reason that's unfortunate is that it's unfair to the movie, which taken on its own terms is a perceptive examination of a family's grief.\n\nIn honoring \"Ordinary People\" with the Best Picture and Best Director statues, Hollywood awarded for the first time one of its most genial figures, Robert Redford. As his directorial debut this is, appropriate enough, a genial movie. But it is difficult to explain why it is a good movie without explaining why it is not a great movie. It is a serious film that deals with death and suicide and broken homes, but it must be acknowledged even by the sympathetic reviewer that its handling of these issues is not much more serious or creative than a \"Very Special Episode\" of some '80s or '90s TV drama. It focuses squarely, all too squarely, on the \"humanity\" of its characters, and it hand-holds the audience through the plot all too gently. It feels, if not preachy, then like a therapy session that we've been assigned to attend because we have not been sufficiently attentive to the pain within ourselves and others. The always-on, always-sensitive tone of this kind of storytelling can be exhausting because it lacks the temporary relief that a little cynicism and distance can provide. The movie demands that you care for all of its characters all the time. This is a tough ask under the best of conditions, but especially when the characters hew too close to stock stereotypes. The high school students all fall pretty neatly into the standard categories of brainless jocks and quirky loners, and the parents are the overly-busy, clueless, grown-apart kinds we've seen before. At the beginning, Redford's directorial style, with its straight-on symmetrical shots of a dining room table and a camera that looks back and forth at people having a conversation like a crowd looks at a tennis match, seems equally unoriginal, but this decision actually pays off toward the end when the same pace simplicity are used to cross-cut a flashback sequence. In the latter case, the person having the flashback is really having a long-delayed, straightforward dialogue with himself, and the visual style suits this culmination well. Yet it is, after all, much like other revelatory and epiphany-creating flashbacks in film and TV.\n\nThe ordinariness of \"Ordinary People\" is probably held against it more than it would be had it not won its Oscars, but at the same time far fewer people would probably watch it today had it not won them. And that would be a shame, because despite its shortcomings, it is an occasionally very perceptive film. For all the times it is too \"on the nose\" with a song choice (\"Hallelujah\" when a character is happy) or a line of dialogue (how many times has \"I miss him too, you know!\" been declaimed on screen?), there are also moments of real observational insight, as when an introverted character presses the \"close door\" button on an elevator rather than risk a social encounter. That rings true, and thankfully it happens without being directly commented upon. The movie also casts Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore against type, which is interesting to see. To watch \"Ordinary People\" is to be reminded that Redford is, by all appearances, a refreshingly warmhearted and compassionate celebrity in an industry that too often rewards egoists and borderline sociopaths. I may be in a minority, but I frankly think it's nice that movies like this can and do win Best Picture over movies that are superior in technique but colder and bleaker in outlook.",

            "content": "Ordinary People is perhaps an unusual choice for Best Picture given the Academy's history. But the film remains relevant with strong performances from the cast, an engaging story and an excellent directorial debut from Robert Redford.\n\nOn TV's House, Wilson's office is decorated with movie posters - originally Orson Welles' Touch of Evil and Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. But when questioned at a press conference, actor Robert Sean Leonard said that Ordinary People was a poster he would like to see in an oncologist's office.  One of his personal favourites, Leonard has called the film \"a fascinating study of human relations and familial relations and human interaction\". For a doctor who duels with a disease that destroys lives and families, often as much a counsellor as a physician, Ordinary People is a film his patients may be encouraged to know he is a fan of. The producers of House soon added an Ordinary People poster to the set.\n\nAs for the film itself, it is quite right to call it a fascinating study of a family struggling to move on from the tragedy of losing a son.\n\nInitially it seems that their surviving son Conrad, (Timothy Hutton) is the one having the hardest time coming to terms with the death of his older brother, Buck. Conrad was with Buck when he died in a boating accident and has just been released from a psychiatric hospital following a suicide attempt.\n\nThe normal teenage dilemma of finding his identity compounds his struggle to resume his life from before his brother's death and his suicide attempt as he questions his taste for his previous interests and what, if anything, he has in common with his old friends. At his father's insistence he starts seeing psychiatrist Dr Burge (Judd Hirsch) who delivers a tough-love approach of challenging Conrad, with understanding but without pity, in scenes that remind one of those between Robin Williams and Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting. Increasingly willing to turn a new leaf in his life Conrad begins dating Jeannie (Elizabeth McGovern), a girl from his school.\n\nBut as the film progresses, we see that Conrad is not the only one struggling for peace. His father Calvin (Donald Sutherland) is also finding it difficult to take an interest in his former career and friends. An awkward nice guy who is afraid of confrontation, Calvin feels he is the only thing holding the family together. Caught between a son self-destructing and a wife in deep denial, the family rift tears Calvin apart until he begins to question whether the family can or should be held together at all.\n\nMother of the family, Beth, is probably the most interesting character in the film, wonderfully portrayed by Mary Tyler Moore. She stubbornly resists any external show of the emotional turmoil she undoubtedly feels. She inexplicably gives priority to keeping up appearances and wants to give no one outside the family any inkling of their troubles or to create scandal or reason for gossip. But her pretence extends within the family where her denial comes across as cold, disconnected and utterly uncaring, particularly as she seems to have elevated her dead son to a position of saintly perfection that only exists in her mind and leaves her surviving son feeling unloved and unable to live up to the image of his dead brother. Calvin increasingly has to play referee between his wife and his son until Beth faces a choice between finally confronting her misery or breaking up the family.\n\nOrdinary People became a box office success and produced career turning performances for a number of participants. Judd Hirsh and Mary Tyler Moore, previously best known for their work in TV sitcoms, managed to challenge preconceptions with stirring dramatic performances. The film gave Elizabeth McGovern, now best known for her role in Downton Abbey, her first major role. Most of all, the film is Robert Redford's directional debut. Redford shows considerable maturity, restraint and subtlety to allow the characters, their dialogue and the plot to speak for themselves rather than spoil the story with over-direction, misplaced innovation or unnecessary emphasis. Instances that may seem clich\u00e9 to a modern audience - such as where Calvin jogs, his mind burdened with thoughts until he stumbles overwhelmed - are few and forgivable.\n\nThe film was well acknowledged with six Academy Award nominations in 1980, winning four - Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Hutton, although it could be argued that his was the lead role), Best Director for Redford and Best Film over The Coal Miner's Daughter and Raging Bull.\n\nThis was a strange time in the history of the Academy. The previous year, another family drama, Kramer vs. Kramer, cleaned up over the brilliant and much fancied Apocalypse Now. It is difficult to elucidate exactly what went on here and why the academy got a sudden taste for private familial dramas of ordinary people over its usual preference for historical events, biopics, epics and stories of overcoming social injustice.\n\nMost likely nothing was going on here and both Kramer vs. Kramer and Ordinary People represent no deviation from the Academy's usual taste for solid performances and safe choices. The success of Ordinary People certainly befits the solid performances in writing, acting and direction.",

This time it was his undisputed masterpiece Goodfellas, losing to the Kevin Costner wank-fest Dances With Wolves.  It must have taken the entire Academy working together to make a mistake that big.\n\nSo, does Ordinary People deserve to be remembered for more than just ruing Martin Scorsese's night in March 1981?

            "content": "Okay next on the 80's we have the first one that won from that decade, so here's Ordinary People.\n\nPlot: The film revolves around a high school boy named Conrad and his parents. After the death of his older brother Buck, Conrad has attempted suicide and has been in a psychiatry hospital for four months before going back to school and joining the swimming team. Meanwhile his mother tries to live life as if the death of Buck never happened by trying to keep the family as it once was while his father has trouble trying to connect with both of them. Eventually, Conrad begins to see a psychiatrist to try to deal with post-dramatic stress disorder and survivor's guilt from his brother's death.\n\nI don't want to start by just saying that with a good movie considering how simple that is to say...but I can't help it. It was. It had a nice story, the characters were very well acted, it was deep and sad and it was just...really good. They very clearly displayed what each character goes through after Buck died and it really shows how the rest of the family is tormented by it. Timothy Hutton as Conrad especially gave out a performance that make it very little wonder that he won an Oscar for his performance... except that his Oscar was for supporting actor and not leading. I say that because personally I felt he was the real main focus of the story. I mean Of coarse Beth and Calvin are part of the main focus of the story, but Conrad was more the person to pay attention to in my opinion. He was there when Buck died, he's the one that tried to commit suicide and is seeing a psychiatrist, he's trying to make things a little better for him at school with quitting the swimming team and starting to date a girl he likes, all while still being haunted and tortured by the stress and guilt of his brother's death. So with all that, I felt he was the main leading character and not really anyone else. But that's just my view on it. And even if he isn't, Beth and Calvin were still very good as the leading roles. Calvin especially I liked during the very end. One of the things I remembered really liking when I last watched the end of this film up till now was his last scene with Beth. I just really liked his monologue when he was talking to her - it was just really well written to me and he acted it out in a way the really went deep into who her character is and how he feels about it.\n\nAnd that's my review for Ordinary People. It had a good story, great performances, a little bit questionable as far as who are the leading or supporting roles but is altogether an enjoyable film.",

It follows a family on the brink of a long built up crumble. I don't really like doing a synopsis, but what the suburban family has gone through was rough. A few scenes once the passiveness was over, had me on the brink of tears. I especially liked the dads performance, which I found like the whole film was genuine. The silent opening credits set a tone, and the film kept its heart the whole way through. The characters became more frank as the movie progressed and the character development was prestige. I felt some character confusion between Karen and the girl Conrad goes bowling with, but other than that it felt like a pure imitation of a family. Powerful family drama, and I'm glad I watched it.",

            "content": "Ordinary People is a really good movie.  I like films that get better and better as they go along, and Ordinary People is a great example of a film that the last half hour was way better then the first half hour.  I also like it when a scene is intense, because of the acting, dialog, and emotion in it instead of just because there was a lot of action in it, and because it was suspenseful.  This film had a lot of really intense and really good scenes.  It is also one of the most well acted movies I have ever watched, and the acting to me seemed like it must have been the hardest type of acting to do.  The acting was very emotional and intense in the film, and that was why the film was so great.  The scene where Conrad (Timothy Hutton) talks to his therapist after he learns that his friend from the hospital just killed herself is one of the best scenes I have ever watched in any movie.  The final scene is also a great scene, but I won't spoil them for you.\n\nConrad (Timothy Hutton) has a lot of problems.  His older brother died in a boating accident, and drowned right in front of him so he has survivor's guilt.  It is a lot like the movie Stand By Me, because the brother was a star athlete and everybody loved him, so the younger brother feels like it should have been him who died.  The film is shows what the death of a child can do to a family.  He tried to kill himself and he was in the hospital for it, and he got held back a year in high school for it.  He has flashbacks of his brother drowning, and they show more and more of it as the film goes along.  He see's a therapist named Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), and his therapist is a really good one that is able to get a lot out of him.  However therapy was looked down on at the time.  During the time, people thought that you were weak if you saw a therapist, but now it is the opposite.\n\nHis mother Beth (Mary Tyler Moore) is really cold to him.  One scene he gives her a hug and she can't even hug him back.  Mary Tyler Moore does a great job of making you really dislike her, and I found myself hating her but you are supposed to.  She tries to act like everything is all right in the house, and she refuses to talk about their problems, and does everything she can to hide them.  She doesn't want anybody to know that Conrad is seeing a therapist, and the fact that he tried to kill himself was a big embarrassment to her.  She just makes matters worse for the family because she is so self-absorbed.  Conrad begins to think that she hates him.  There is a lot of intensity that builds up with that.  The fact that Conrad is so close to his father Calvin (Donald Sutherland) makes her look even worse.  Conrad and Calvin are both suffering, and the fact that she is so self absorbed catches up to her in the end, and they start saying things to her.  She just ignores all of their problems, and she hurts them by that, because she refuses to try to help herself, or her family.  She gets mad if one of them reveals any of their problems.  I found that I really liked everybody in the movie besides her.\n\nIt is a thought provoking film, and the stuff with Conrad made me think, like the fact that he said to his friend from the hospital that he misses the hospital made me think.  I think he missed it, because his home life is so bad that the hospital must have been better.  Plus because the mother was stubborn about admitting or facing any of their problems, he couldn't be helped in any way.  But at the hospital he was constantly getting help, and I think that is why he misses the hospital.  The girl who he was friends with at the hospital made me think about weather or not she was happy like she said she was.  It felt like she was putting on a mask, and hiding her struggles and it turned out that she was.  The film shows what will happen if you are always wearing a mask and if you are hiding your problems.  The film teaches that you should always be seeking help no matter what you think people will think of you.  That was the message or lesson that this film taught.\n\nThis was a great movie that had a secret message that you needed to think about, and figure out for yourself.  The message was one that all humans should learn if they don't already know it, because it will really help you.  The acting is phenomenal, and I felt like Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Judd Hirsch, and Timothy Hutton gave performances that were good enough for academy awards.  Timothy Hutton did win an award for best actor, and Judd Hirsch, and Mary Tyler Moore were nominated.  The film won best picture that year, and Robert Redford won best director, and it was his directorial debut that he won for.  Alvin Sargent did win the award for best screenplay too.  I must say that I thought the film deserved all of the awards it got, and it was a great one.  Somebody may not like it, because it is slow, and it is sad, but if you are ok with that you will love it.  I would definitely recommend this.",

            "content": "Ordinary People doesn't pack the same emotional punch that it did back in 1980 because many films have mirrored the themes since then, and actors such as Judd Hirsch and Mary Tyler Moore are relatively unknown to today's generation so their branches-out performances don't seem as surprising to audiences, but since it's an exploration of emotional frailty amongst a \"normal\" family and is constantly realistic, it succeeds as an emotional venture into the psych of various family members.\n\nRobert Redford's directional debut is beautifully made with great film editing, proper cinematography and am unforgettable musical score. The story begins with shots of an ordinary neighbourhood while an emotionally rich song plays over the background, and from there we know that its going to be a simple and sad story. His direction elevates this story above mere melodrama and makes it artistic. He did an excellent job as a first-time director with a budget of only $6 Million, and he provided a front for actors to launch their careers or branch them out which is one of the best things a film can do for it's stars. His creation managed to give new meaning to the term \"Ordinary People\".\n\nDonald Sutherland takes the lead as the supportively unstable father of the Jarrett family and really plays the part convincingly, never overdoing anything or trying to be anything more than a caring father. His chemistry with various characters is what holds them together as a convincing family.\nTimothy Hutton however, is the man who steals the screen. In his film debut, he displays the ability to act as if he has been working in films for years, but in actuality it's all new to him. He brings tremendous strength to the role of a psychologically damaged teenager attempting to cope with several issues as if he is really still a boy that has gone through all of this and is being forced to relive it in Ordinary People. His performance displays raw talent that's difficult to find in film youth, and the fact that his career has been low profile since then is a terrible injustice, because I also loved his work on Taps.\nI've never seen The Dick Van Dyke Show or The Mary Tyler Moore show do my understanding of Mary Typer Moore is nothing, but her performance here as an emotionally fragile mother is a depiction of one that we all feel as if we have at one point in life. The facade Beth Jarrett puts up for her family is a difficult thing to deal with for her family, and it just brings a whole new level of drama to Ordinary People. Her performance was great.\nLastly, straight out of Taxi is the talented Judd Hirsch in an unexpected dramatic turn which is the kind of performance that can only be described as redefining. For once, a film features a psychiatrist in a more positive light as a friendly person, not just one trying to crack open someone's head for $200 an hour. Hirsch supplies great strength to his role as Dr. Tyrone C. Berger and is really the only consistently friendly character throughout the film which makes the tone a little lighter.\n\nOrdinary People is a difficult film to watch if you're emotionally weak, especially because of the emotional trauma of the characters and the ending, and since there's a constant sense of realism it may be found to hit a little close to home for some people, but it appeals to others for these same reasons, so Ordinary People is a very emotional venture that I wish I had seen when I was young so that I could learn more from it than watching it today.",

The film basically follows a family after the tragic death of a son, and the attemped suicide of another son. The emotions, attitudes, and overall conflicts were so real. I truly felt like the film could have been about any ordinary person.\r\n\r\nThis film is perfectly acted! Timothy Hutton gives an absolutely phenomenal performance for which he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His performance is one of the reasons this film is among my favorites. Mary Tyler Moore gives a completely missunderstood performance as the mother. It's probably a career best for her and she definitely deserved the Oscar nomination.

This film can be hard to watch, because of the emotionally heavy subject matter, but otherwise there's no reason at all to miss it.  One of the greatest movies ever made about a family in a mid-life crisis.",
