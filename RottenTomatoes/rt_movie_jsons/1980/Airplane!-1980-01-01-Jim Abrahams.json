Bei solchen Art von Filmen ist die Story absolut egal das wichtigste ist der Humor und die Unterhaltung. Es ist einer der witzigsten Filme die ich gesehen habe. Leider gibt es heutzutage nicht mehr gut gemachte Filme dieser Art. Für einige ist der Humor garnichts, weil die Momente zu rendom sind oder zu Flach. Die Hauptfigur Ted (Robert Hays) fande ich nicht so interessant da waren die Nebenfiguren viel interessanter. Es gibt viele Gags die sich wiederholen, die sich leicht unterscheiden. \n\n\n\n8,5/10",

            "content": "It's hard for comedies to compete in the greatest films category. Those funny pictures, they get no respect. I'm part of the problem. I'm more impressed when a movie makes me cry than laugh. But among the great comedy films, there are a few that rise above the clouds. \n\nWritten and directed by Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker (known collectively as ZAZ), Airplane! is a game changing, genre-bending parody and one of the greatest films ever made. I saw Airplane! as a young adult and instantly loved it. This is a major feat considering I didn't understand half the jokes. Who the hell is Anita Bryant? Is \"River of Jordan\" a Peter, Paul & Mary song?\n\nAirplane! has humble origins. Jim, David, and Jerry were a couple of Jewish kids from Wisconsin with a dream to write comedy. In 1977, the trio broke into show business when John Landis directed their low-budget sketch anthology The Kentucky Fried Movie. Robert Rodriguez would later observe that anthology movies work best when the same writers and directors are involved with all the segments.\n\nTeam ZAZ spent six years writing Airplane! The first draft was completed in 1974 and borrowed heavily from Zero Hour! (1957) and the four Airport movies that were released in the 1970s. This primed the pump perfectly for Airplane's release in 1980. Known for surreal humor, slapstick comedy, and deadpan perfection, Airplane! set the bar for disaster film parodies. Airplane! was in the right place at the right time. \n\nMel Brooks had already done his best work and Rob Reiner's career had yet to begin. It was time for ZAZ to earn their place in the Jewish Comedy Hall of Fame. Airplane! follows ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker and his attempt to win back a flight attendant named Elaine Dickinson. While aboard a plane, many of the passengers and crew become sick with food poisoning and it's up to Ted to face his fear and land the plane.\n\nAirplane! is a joke machine. It's filled with sight gags, references, and one-liners. There's music from Jaws and the Bee Gees. The White Zone / Red Zone scene used the actual LAX announcers. The Oveur, Roger, Victor scene was inspired by Abbot & Costello. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar plays Roger Murdock, an LA Laker who moonlights as a co-pilot. Team ZAZ spoofed Enter the Dragon in their first film and later cast Kareem who was in Bruce Lee's Game of Death. I think that Kareem is the greatest but my dad says he doesn't work hard enough on defense.\n\nBarbara Billingsley of Leave It to Beaver fame plays \"against type\" as a woman who can translate jive. There are competing Boys' Life and Nuns' Life magazines. For three Jewish kids, there are ample nun jokes. There's a whole conversation with Clarence Oveur that ends with the line, \"Give me Hamm on 5 and hold the Mayo.\" There are African natives who are naturally good at basketball. And there's a classic line about a girl who likes her coffee like she likes her men – black. \n\nThe movie plays everything straight. If there's a reference in the movie, it's funnier than the source material. The Mrs. Hammen line \"Jim never has a second cup of coffee at home\" is taken from a Yuban Coffee commercial. She's even played by the same actress Lee Bryant. When the girl scouts fight in the Magumba Bar they fight like WWE performers. When Randy sings \"River of Jordan\" she actually has an amazing voice. There's even a full-size plane model that crashes through a terminal and it looks expensive. \n\nZAZ doesn't just parody, they elevate. Ted and Elaine spoof the famous beach kiss in From Here to Eternity. Ronald Regan gets two references a year before he became President. One sick passenger says, \"I haven't felt this awful since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.\" And in the third act, Dr. Rumack gives Ted a pep talk that ends with \"win just one for the Zipper,\" a reference to Knute Rockne (1940). \n\nMay Day is revealed to be the Russian New Year (aka the Soviet Union in 1980). There's also an edgy bestiality joke that I'm choosing to believe is a reference to the horse head in The Godfather. In addition to all the great jokes, Airplane! is legitimately dramatic and suspenseful. The build up to Ted landing the plane is treated seriously by the cast and direction. I was sweating like Ted in the pilot seat. The kiss at the end between Ted and Elaine feels earned and is moving. \n\nElmer Bernstein was tasked with writing a B-movie score and gave us one better. The score here is poetic and soaring. It's energetic, thrilling, and elevates the movie. The Airplane! cast is a secret weapon. Known for playing the stern director of the Impossible Missions Force, Peter Graves is wonderfully off kilter as Clarence Oveur. Despite the inappropriate undertones, \"Have you ever seen a grown man naked?\" is an amazing line delivery. \n\nIt's important to remember that ZAZ isn't endorsing the perverted Captain Oveur. They're making fun of perverts and media hysteria. Joey is blissfully ignorant and in no real danger. Leslie Nielson as Dr. Rumack is a revelation. Leslie is a dramatic actor with a flair for comedy and the ultimate dead pan delivery. I've quoted the line \"We're all counting on you\" more than I can remember. \n\nLloyd Bridges is an ace card. He's wild, unhinged, and commits to the role. We all have bad days and who among us hasn't said, \"I've picked the wrong day to quit drinking.\" That line never fails to cheer me up. My favorite joke is when an elderly woman asks for some light reading and Elaine replies with, \"How about this leaflet, Famous Jewish Sports Legends?\" This joke summarizes the ZAZ sense of humor. The boys know how to make fun of themselves.\n\nIn 2012 Empire listed Airplane! as the Greatest Comedy of All Time. There's a case to be made. The film was hugely successful and launched the careers of Jim, David, and Jerry. Movies like Top Secret!, The Naked Gun, Hot Shots! and the Scary Movie franchise are direct descendants of Airplane! It's encouraging to see three kids from Milwaukee make comedy history.",

Movies are not for weighty material, generally; they exist to entertain, so you have someplace to go with a friend. \"Airplane!\" summarizes the genre with a series of skits that make fun of everything under the sun and unintentionally provide some solid social criticism in the process, namely that the pretense of humanity prevents us from seeing how absurd our lives are. Lots of slapstick, sight gags, running jokes, and parodic slaying of cultural and historical icons gives this film its fuel, but its energy comes from converting the steady onset of dread of a disaster film into unhinged hilarity.",

The Acting/Delivery of the jokes are extremely well done, with most of the acting being very dead pan and played as straight as possible which makes it even funnier. The only weak spot is the plot is very light and too simple but the gags and antics all make up for it and you don't even notice because your having such a great time and want to see what happens next despite the lack of a plot too simple to even be called a simple plot.

(1980) is as classic as comedies get with every line being quotable. Memorable writing from these 3 clear geniuses is what drives Airplane! to remain genius. Their use of recurring gags, verbal puns, obscure references, outrageous surrealist humor, and deranged slapstick.\n\nPatrick Kennedy's editing keeps Airplane! to a blissful 88 minutes of constant jokes and laughter at random non-sequiturs. Joseph F. Biroc's cinematography is very versatile as he shoots many medium shots indoors to keep Airplane! interesting throughout despite its little plane set. Ward Preston's production design is fun for the goofy control tower and silly plane set. Elmer Bernstein's score is super neat with a realistic thriller score, he changes the tone of Airplane! Rosanna Norton's costumes are cute and campy enough to work for this farce.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar's cameo as the co-pilot delivers my favorite scene in Airplane! His casual manner is perfect for Airplane!'s deadpan delivery. Leslie Nielsen's deadpan doctor is incredibly funny and memorable. I like every stupid line this guy says in Airplane! I love Lloyd Bridges as the nervous, addicted control tower guide. Peter Graves is a comedic genius for delivering his perverted lines as the plane captain. Robert Stack's serious pilot guide is a great addition.\n\nJulie Hagerty is wonderful as the lead actress willing to be a ridiculous romance lead. She has fun chemistry with the overly serious Robert Hayes as the pilot with a drinking problem. I really adored Lorna Patterson as Randy the emotional and helpful stewardess.\n\nI must mention Stephen Stucker is absolutely hilarious as the flamboyant tower secretary or whatever he was supposed to be.

Review \n\tAirplane! is a laugh out loud riot with several different types of humor: satire, play on words, slapstick, facetious dark humor, relational humor, inside jokes, parody, irony, breaking the fourth wall, and topical humor. Airplane! may have a few outdated jokes but it still very much works as a straight out comedy. \n\tIn Airplane! a man who has not flown a plane in years named Ted ends up having to land a plane safely once the pilots of the plane become ill.\nThere is also plenty of quirks that involve play on words such as when Ted says to Dr. Rumack \"surely you can't be serious\" and Dr. Rumack says \"I am and don't call me Shirley.\" There is also another play on words moment when the navigator of the plane Captain  Oveur gets a call from an operator asking him if she can put the Mayo Clinic on the line and she then says there's a Mister Ham on line 5 and Captain Oveur says \"alright put ham on 5 hold the mayo.\" \n\tThe film has an abundance of its own material (considered new material at the time) in regards to quirks but also very much borrows from spoofing or parodying other material or films which includes: Jaws, Saturday Night Fever, From Here to Eternity, Pinocchio, and Knute Rockne All American. The film has topical humor with poking fun at then candidate for president Ronald Reagan such as when a sick lady says, \"I haven't felt this awful since we saw that Ronald Reagan film\". Airplane! also pokes fun at Reagan when it spoofs off of a film he was in called Knute Rockne All American. Ronald Reagan at the time was thought of as a joke running for president. \n\tThere are moments that involve breaking the fourth wall such as when the character Ted talks to the camera and audience in one scene, and when a boy named Joey refers to one of the pilots by the actor or athlete who plays the character by calling the pilot Kareem Abdul Jabbar instead of by the character's name Roger Murdock, and this leads to Joey and Roger arguing which creates topical yet outdated humor.\n\tThe film has dark humor or dark comedy when it makes light of certain situations that happen,  that normally or always would be taken seriously in real life such as when Dr. Rumack talks about the symptoms of the passengers being sick to Ted's girlfriend Elaine from eating the fish and Captain Oveur acts out the symptoms while he's flying the plane, and another example would be when one of the stewardess named Randy is singing and playing a guitar and ends up accidently disconnecting one of the tubes that's connected to a sick girl named Lisa.\n\tAirplane! is a brilliant piece of filmmaking with having the ability of being versatile with having many different types of comedy rolled into one.",

To this day, \"Airplane\" flies in the rarefied air of The American Film Institute's Top 10 Comedies, and has spawned modern day descendants from the smartly vulgar \"Sausage Party\" to recent and raunchy record label parody \"Stadium Anthems.\"\n\nThis is a gag-fest of the first order, with no stone left unturned: Sexual, racial, and religious humor punch through gleefully and without apology as a commercial airline's two pilots (Peter Graves and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) get food poisoning mid-flight. Ex-military pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is the sole remaining flyer aboard, but he's only handled single-engine planes, and suffers mightily from PTSD. Back at the tower, lead air traffic controller Steve McKrosky (a sublime Lloyd Bridges) is drinking, sniffing glue, and blitzing on amphetamines. Only the airline's Chief Flight Instructor, Rex Kramer (a deadpan Robert Stack), can talk Striker through a safe landing. \"Steve,\" Kramer says to McKrosky, \"I want every light you have poured onto that field.\" On cue, a dump truck deposits hundreds of household lamps on the runway -- that's the brand of inspired genius we're dealing with here.\n\nWith its unrelenting onslaught of absurdist humor, \"Airplane!\" is one of the best and most enduring comedies ever. - WATCHED IT?

Some of Airplane!'s best comedy has retained its effectiveness over the years. There's a great \"who's on first\" bit in the cockpit between Oveur and Roger. Leslie Nielsen's deadpan \"Don't call me Shirley\" makes its debut here. Lloyd Bridges remarks that this is a bad day for him to stop smoking/drinking/taking amphetamines/sniffing glue.

I think most people are comfortable in admitting that this genre was killed off by a string of terrible movies in the 2000s. However, back to this picture. Very few comedies can say they're a laugh-a-minute. Many of the greats can't even say that, but Airplane! can. Like the critics consensus says, it is absolutely \"juvenile and silly,\" but it embraces that and runs with it.

Why?\nI have not enjoyed a 90 or so minute comedy genre film as much for years. \nThe plot is pretty simple (and inconsequential), it revolves around a US domestic flight to Chicago where several members of the crew and passengers are struck down with severe food poisoning. The crew includes the pilot and his co-pilots leaving the fate of the craft in the hands of an inflatable auto pilot and a drunken veteran passenger.\nThe film spoofs several films from the 1970s including Jaws in the introduction and Saturday Night Fever featuring a rip-roaring rendition of Staying Alive by The Bee Gees.\nThe jokes are very un-politically correct in many scenes broaching subject's that wouldn't dare to be touched in modern film and television including casual racusm, paedophilia, pornography and substance misuse. However none of these subjects are real before any Liberals get on their high horses.\nThe cast seems pretty unknown to me perhaps because of my age (I was only 3 when this film was made).\nThe only person I recognised was a pre Naked Gun trilogy Leslie Nielsen as a doctor aboard the aircraft.\nTo be honest Nielsen although he shows some nods and winks pkays his part more straight faced than his Naked Gun character.\nExcellent film that dedpute its age is still funny.",

This is the first film I've seen that made my throat hurt. Leslie Nielsen gives one of his best performances as a straight-faced, know-it-all doctor who says one-liner after one-liner after one-liner. This movie knows exactly what it is, and a film like this is good at being what it is. It is the best parody movie ever seen.

Is one the funniest films, it just has to be because not only is it timed to perfection but it also just picks the very best things to make you laugh too. You might beforehand and after viewing see this as a silly little movie that is really dumb, but that is the whole point, the movie doesn't make any sense and half of the fun in this is spotting the little jokes played out in nearly every character on the plane. The whole plot plays out like the old disaster movies such as \"Zero Hour!\" and \"Airport 1975\" and really parodies them well with clichés in huge abundance all-round. We see ex-fighter pilot Ted Striker haunted by his past flying in the US air force as he basically buys a ticket on the flight to chase his love Elaine (Julie Hagerty). The flight becomes a farce though as food poisoning causes problems, and it may be up to Striker to help land the plane, if he can that is with all the ridiculous amount of sweat dripping down his face. \n\nOf course the plot is not as serious at all as it sounds and to be fair it's absolutely crazy, there is two guys talking \"Jive\", a girl who needs a transplant, a pilot who takes a keen liking to children and another pilot who's Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The whole cast are like some kind of perfect casting, you just can't imagine many others replacing them and it just plays out like some kind of insane pantomime thousands of feet in the air. If there is someone who really stands out it is Leslie Nielsen as Dr. Rumack who is the definition of that timed to perfection jokes part I said about, the guys behind this picked him well and they would pick him again for the \"Naked Gun\" movies and the TV show they also made. \n\nJim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker direct and write this as a group and oh what a job they do, they make this movie that on the cover may look not that good but within is like a comedy master class. I think they actually tried hard to create the jokes I mean they are smart and well thought up, they poke fun at people and at other movies too and they create a lovely mess of a movie that is really well, loveable. If I have ever seen slapstick comedy done this well then it's it probably not since the golden days of the silent movie, except this movie also has jokes by people talking too which makes this even better. \n\nIf you're looking for good old fun in under 90 minutes this is your treat because not only does it get you laughing but also never drags, it gets it all out what it wants to say and I felt the guys behind it would have ruined this if it would been too long. I can see some not liking it because as I previously said it's silly, some might consider themselves too \"high-brow\" but in fairness no one can deny this is smart and well thought up, it's the kind of comedy I think everyone can enjoy not just certain ages etc. \n\nSo overall is it the greatest comedy ever? ,well no or maybe who really knows, but one thing is for sure this has to be up there in the lists that people make when they compile the greatest comedies. On that previous point this in my opinion should be considered one the greatest, not only does it boast laughs but they are also memorable and the line \"And stop calling me Shirley\" is one of the most famous in comedy cinema history.",

Airplane! excels at that, offering loads of big laughs. The script never takes a brake, squeezing in a laugh at every possible place - resulting in moments so funny you laugh just from thinking about the movie. Ultimately, Airplane! set the bar for the constant laughs that's still being impersonated today.",

This women works as a flight attendee and the man decides to check in a flight to talk to her, but his plan backfires and the whole crew becomes sick because of food poisoning, and this man is the only one who has experience with a plane, as he tries to save everybody's lives on the plane and get even with his love in this awesome, amazing, funny, outrageously hilarious, stupid, slapstick, comic, entertaining comedy spoof.

This movie is just awesome. It was made in a time where spoof movies weren't, well, awful. It's full of great gags, perfect timing, hilarious quotes, and pop culture references that are still funny as hell, and I wasn't even born until 16 years after this movie came out. Hands down, the best part of this movie was Leslie Nielsen, who's deadpan style and brilliant comedic timing stole every scene he was in. Lloyd Bridges is also great, Robert Hays is great, Julie Hagerty is great, Peter Graves is great, everyone is freakin' great.\nAirplane is awesome. Go see it. Now. Right now, dammit.",

In Airplane!, a flight and it's crew fall sick and the only man that can save this plane is Ted Striker, an ex-pilot.\r\n\r\nThat's it for story but who gives a damn that's it not of high quality storytelling when the comedy, characters and performances are more than high quality and WILL leave you in stitches. Visual gags, verbal puns, slapsticks, purposeful continuity errors and funny montages are effortlessly delivered, in the opening listen to the people on the speaker systems arguing, all the double entendre and spoofing and parodying of real life is masterfully executed, but for me the funniest part of the whole movie is when the hostess plays guitar for the sick kid, everyone on board sings along and smiles at the camera breaking the fourth wall in spectacular style, all whilst the sick kid is having a fit. It's absolutely hilarious and I almost lost my breath from laughing too hard. As well as having Leslie Nielsen doing what he does best, Lloyd Bridges from Hot Shots! joins in the fun as tower supervisor McCroskey, Bridges' quotes are some of the funniest I've ever heard, and watch closely when he's handling cigarettes. Let's put is simply, every single character in this movie is funny, and the cast behind them are tremendous, you will enjoy Airplane!",

Great visual gags, and some of the most quotable dialog ever written. Timeless too, and just as funny now as it was back in 1980. There's so much to discover. I've watched this film several times over the years, and only on this last viewing did I notice the adult magazine section at the airport was labeled 'Whacking Material!' How did I miss that!?\n\nIt's just so silly too. It's like directors/writers Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Jerry Zucker decided no idea was too crazy. So we get inflatable auto-pilots. Jive talking passengers. Airport public address operators arguing over the red/white loading areas and abortion! A smoking section plane ticket, that's literally smoking! It's just ridiculous. But in the best possible way.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nAirplane is a classic spoof. Not even Leslie Nielsen's Naked Gun series got this good. More recent spoofs like the Scary Movie series are just not in the same league as Airplane. Be in the mood for a barrage of great quotes and visual gags. When someone says 'the shit's going to hit the fan' - expect to see exactly that!\n\nBest Format:\nA regular DVD or streaming show is good enough for this film. Watch this on a nice big TV though as you'll need to keep an eye out for all the hilarious ideas squeezed into every shot.\n\nBest moments for me:\n\nThere are too many to mention. But I especially loved the scenes near the beginning of the film with the name confusion between the 3 pilots. Roger Murdock (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) and Victor Basta (Frank Ashmore). Here's one exchange between these three men that always cracks me up!\n\nRoger Murdock: We have clearance, Clarence.\n\nCaptain Oveur: Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?\n\nTower voice: Tower's radio clearance, over!\n\nCaptain Oveur: That's Clarence Oveur. Over.\n\nTower voice: Over.\n\nCaptain Oveur: Roger.\n\nRoger Murdock: Huh?\n\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

On top of that, it's also the type of film that has a jokes you don't catch the first time around, giving it great rewatchability. What do I mean by it being kind of dumb, but having intelligence? Well it is hard to explain properly. It isn't a bunch of random garbage thrown on the screen, like the Scary Movie franchise, or Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, etc. The dialogue between the characters sounds really stupid, if taken literally, but in the context of the film, they're quite smart and funny. Here's an example: Main Character: \"Surely you can't be serious.\" Leslie Nielsen: \"I am serious and don't call me Shirley.\" You see what I'm getting at? This wouldn't work if taken literally or if it was over exaggerated by the actors. It lets you decipher what is said, which allows you to laugh.

The story is about Ted Striker who has a fear of flying but boards a jumbo jet anyway to woo back his girlfriend. When some of the passengers and crew members are decimated with food poisoning, it is up to Striker to land the plane. The gags do get a laugh sometimes which I will give it that, Leslie Nielsen plays the doctor in the movie, it has all the 1980s cliches which I loved in this to bits and they pretty much satirize everything in the background without hammering in thinly written humour. Overall, this movie is not just a good, funny parody but also an excellent thriller as well. Airplane! (1980) gets a solid 9.5/10.",

We have puns, slapstick, reimagined stereotypes, unexpected forays into the explicit, exaggerations of typically marginal details in the airport / airplane, plain remakes of scenes from contemporary cinema, and (another one that most spoof films miss) a script so well threaded that, if you have been paying attention, you are rewarded with occurrences that slowly reveal themselves as jokes and in-movie references.

            "content": "Back in the days before the Wayans brothers began to prove that quality cinematic farce may be dead, there was a revolution in spoof movies, and it all started with Airplane. What the Zucker brothers created was truly brilliant. It had jokes that were perfect for the time, and yet was also loaded with timeless humor that continues to entertain young generations. They targeted the disaster B-movies like Zero Hour which had their own unintentional humor, and just ramped up the ridiculous. Amazingly they actually make a compelling story inside this series of insane events, by ripping off the outline of Zero Hour, even to the point of simulating some of the same camerawork.\n\nThe true genius of this movie is the casting. The directors brilliantly selected a lineup of great dramatic actors. The setup was simple. The actors would play the entire film straight, as though men wearing 2 pairs of sunglasses and random spears flying into the wall were perfectly normal. So the ridiculous unfolds around them, and creates a new layer of humor as the actors play it as though this stuff happens every day. Particularly remarkable are actors like Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Leslie Nielsen who had made their careers acting in totally dramatic television and films. Leslie Nielsen even spun this design of comedy into a series of spoof TV shows and movies.\n\nI love this film for bringing a fresh style to farce on the big screen, but there are a couple reasons that I don't consider it one of my favorite films. First and foremost, they sometimes go a little too low-brow with the humor. Cheap sex jokes and random nudity don't exactly suit my personal sense of humor. The other problem is that the humor is a very acquired taste. It seems that this movie draws a strong love-it-or-hate-it reaction. I'm definitely in the love-it camp, but sometimes it's a struggle to find someone to watch and laugh with me. However, even if I end up watching by myself, this classic comedy is one of those films that I get sucked into and watch until the end every time I catch it on TV.",

While on board to talk to \"Elaine\", the flight crew, and some passengers, come down with a very serious case of food poisoning, and he has to conquer his fear very quickly to safely land the airplane with the help of his former superior officer who is talking him down from Chicago Air Traffic Control. \r\n\r\nAirplane! is one of the craziest movies you will ever see. There are way too many sight gags, slapsticK and funny one-liners in the film, which will require that you watch it over and over and over again. \r\n\r\nThe all-star cast is hilariously fantastic, and somehow manages to play all their parts straight-faced despite the jokes that are just flying out of their mouths and around them. Leslie Neilsen stands out of the crowd with the ability to make his character, \"Dr. Rumack\", appear as a character in a more serious motion picture. Without giving too much away, you will see a lot of performers you would think would stay away from such an absurd movie such as this one. \r\n\r\nA word of warning, or maybe a few, Airplane! does not give the audience a rest between jokes. Some jokes work, some jokes don't -- and some jokes are so outdated that only those old enough to remember what was going on when the movie was released will laugh. The jokes are very clean, with just a pinch of more adult-oriented humor, which is on-screen very briefly. \r\n\r\nThe plot is forgettable, thanks to the jokes that just don't seem to stop. It's there though, but you will be laughing enough to not even care about the story the film is telling. \r\n\r\nThe visuals, and there are a lot of them, are mostly sight gags. However, you can easily tell that shots of the doomed airplane in-flight is a model. However, the model (or models) are shot in a way to make it appear to be a full-scale airplane. \r\n\r\nLike I said earlier, the cast is fantastic at playing their characters. None of the performances are intentionally way over-the-top, despite the movie being that way. There are some members of the supporting cast I think could have been used a little more, but they do help advance the storyline quite nicely. \r\n\r\nThere are lots of references to movies this movie is spoofing. So, if you have never seen any of the airplane in danger movies that came out before Airplane!, you might not catch them. However, two classic movies that are referenced are very well known, and you will recognize them right off. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Airplane! would be not just a \"Must See\" movie rental, but a fantastic addition to your video/DVD collection. \r\n\r\nAnd one more thing -- \"Stop calling me 'Shirley.'\"",

I loved the black men whose dialogue had to be subtitled and the little girl who made a fish face when her tube was accidently removed by a guitar.

The gags (both visual & verbal) start immediately and don't stop until the end of the film. Trust me, you'll be laughing from beginning to end, mainly with the late Leslie Nielsen as the doctor.

There's also a girl headed to a heart transplant on the plane. Ted Striker (Robert Hays), who only boarded the plane to save his relationship with his girl Elaine Dickinson, must land the plane, though he feels he can't since the war accident he's been in. Since this is a spoof movie, it's all in execution, which is not half bad.\r\n\r\nACTING:If it weren't a spoof, it would be horrible. But it is, so it's intended to sound bad. But the best actor, being the most serious throughout with the best jokes, is the late great Leslie Neilson.\r\n\r\nSCORE:Cheesy, but kind of meant to be.\r\n\r\nOTHER CONTENT:I rated this so low because I found some of the jokes not so funny, just bland so it ended up boring me. Not all were bad, thus the higher rating. Two characters that just trip me out are the gay guy at the control tower and the \"I picked the wrong week to stop....\" guy. Also, people say that if you take away the gags it would be a very compelling drama, well it's a spoof OF a very compelling drama! Airport. LOOK IT UP. Just to say for my friend, I DO appreciate some things but not a lot. \r\n\r\nOVERALL, it's a neutral spoof comedy with an ok executed plot, meant-to-suck acting, cheesy score, and only a FEW funny scenes.",

In fact, cliché-ridden story in this film actually works because they're there for the purpose of parody, which this film does well. Aside from that, the pacing was quite light and comfortable, so none of the scenes felt particularly contrived or bloated. The characters are admittedly the weakest part of the film, but these stock characters are part of the joke. The performances also make up for the fairly weak personalities of the characters they play. In other words, this is a film that's funny enough that you don't have to take the characters seriously. The film itself looks quite polished, and is very good at presenting itself, but its main asset is its arsenal of in-your-face jokes and downright crazy gags. Often, it can come across as a bit juvenile, but the jokes are done well enough that it doesn't matter. It's completely silly, and that's what makes it a great film in the first place.",

The jokes-they come fast and furious from the first shot of the film-are often anti-religious, anti-gay, nearly scatological and pander to the lowest common denominator.  That's precisely why the film is as funny as it is.  We never expect the script to go there...but it does.  Watch a little boy's critique of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's basketball skills.  Who would actually say things like \"you don't play defense\" to a man who towers over 95% of the population?  The film tends to lose steam in the last 15 minutes, primarily because it never follows up on any of the subplots it sets into motion, like a little girl on the way for a transplant.  A sub-90 minute running time helps immensely, though I wonder what would happen if the editing got a little tighter and an extra five minutes were cut?",

We're all counting on you.\"\r\n\r\nSynopsis:  Traumatized former combat pilot Ted Striker is forced to land a passenger plane when food poisoning strikes the crew and there's no one else on board who can do the job.\r\n\r\nGreat films usually have the distinct ability to generate adoration from individuals that know nothing ( or care nothing) about the subject they cover. For example, i care nothing for ballade, but 2010's Black Swan was an emotional tour de force, great film's transend both subject matter and time to earn our effection and praise.  Now, I've always had a problem with spoof comedies, I find their general lack of sophistication and wit compared to other comedy sub-genres to be a flaw.\r\n\r\nAnd the much acclaimed Airplane! is no different.  A quick look at wikipedia should give some insight into the reception this 80's spoof has obtained, including being considered by many to be one of the greatest comedies of all-time.  I don't see it, the film isn't much more than the run of the mill spoof comedies, with the added benefit of being a novel idea in 1980.  The picture is noteworthy for having a very high density of gags and jokes, like a golf course worker constantly being pelted with golf balls while he's in the confines of his vehicle.  The problem is that a majority of these gags never find true their mark, either time has diluted these jokes' relevancy or they simply aren't all that funny.  For a picture considered to be an all-time classic, that's a problem.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the picture is saved by the simple fact that theres so many gags to go through, it's likely that even if you laugh only half the time your supposed to, you'll still be laughing a lot.  The film's central concede is also a lifesaver.  B-movies, especially the poor ones, tend to take themselves too seriously and think themselves more important than they really are, and Airplane constantly scoffs at these films' uptight persona.  Airplane! knows it's ridiculously stupid, and makes fun of those that don't.\r\n\r\nThough it fails to transcend it's novel concept, perhaps with repeat viewings the picture will grow on me.  For now,  Airplane!'s commentary on B-movie conventions and sheer number of gags, make it worthwhile.",

If I had to describe the brand of humor I'd say it's something like a four-way cross between a Mort Drucker MAD Magazine drawing, a Mel Brooks film, Monty Python's most ridiculous sketches, and an SNL sketch. But that's only an approximation.  It fills in pretty much every piece of the humor spectrum, there's something for everyone; subtle to outrageous, parody to pulled-from-nowhere-nonsense.  \n\nIt's just fun.  End of sentence.

I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie, but I can imagine not wanting to hang out with someone who didn't.  I definitely recommend this movie.\nFull review at: http://robertreviewsstuff.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/airplane-1980/",

It is essentially like watching a live-action cartoon with the way background characters behave and the physics of the plane itself.  Plenty of well timed over-exaggerations are to be found here.  This film has no problem making fun of itself.  Combine the humor with the outrageous plot of war veteran Ted Striker having to land a plane due to a mysterious outbreak of food poisoning and you have a complete package of comedic gold.  Surely, I can't be serious, but I am.  This film literally has everything, jokes, innuendos, romance, war flashbacks and even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  His appearance alone should be a solid reason to see this film.  Over thirty years later, Airplane! is funny and is an excellent example of just how much movies with a PG rating could get away with back then.",

It would have been easy to make it a parody of something particular, like the disaster movies that were popular at the box office throughout the 1970s, and it does draw on those. But it also grabs from a much larger bag of contemporary references: the movie opens with the \"Jaws\" theme, progresses to a \"Saturday Night Fever\" parody, and casts Kareem Abdul-Jabbar specifically to make jokes about his basketball career. Abdul-Jabbar's comedic timing is a little on the slow side, but it makes no difference because the joke is that he's playing himself playing someone else. \"Airplane!\" is still funny because of the kind of comedy it uses. When it goes for topical humor, it goes so big-the biggest blockbusters, the biggest athletes, the biggest politicians-that almost everyone is in on the jokes without explanation, even decades later. A few lines might send younger viewers to Wikipedia, but those lines are the exception rather than the rule. Mostly the movie eschews referential comedy in favor of basic puns and gags. As with all comedy bits, some work (the send-ups of epic movie speeches are all well-delivered), some get old (the gay jokes haven't aged great), and a lot just depends on taste (from what I understand, some people don't like puns!) Nothing pleases all of the people all of the time, but with wordplay, surrealism, and slapstick in its arsenal, \"Airplane!\" probably pleases all of the people some of the time. For a broad comedy that's the idea.",
