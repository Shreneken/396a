            "content": "Giacobbe \"Jake\" LaMotta (Robert De Niro) is never actually called \"Raging Bull\" in the film, but there couldn't be a better nickname for the middleweight boxer in describing his personality both in and outside the ring. The sports actually in sports movies are usually pretty poor and the story typically has much more to do with the lives of the characters and their broader impact on the culture, but boxing seems to be an exception, as it is one of the most exciting, intimate, and enjoyable sports to capture in a dramatic film. In black & white, Scorsese puts forth a brutal movie from start to finish where you expect some of this sweat and bloodshed to act as a release for the irascible and uncontainable LaMotta. It's the 1940s and 50s at the height of the urban Italian stereotype — think arguments from window to the street, guinea tees, crucifixes hanging on walls, and domestic abuse. Everyone, all the time, seems to be yelling and pushing and threatening each other with LaMotta at the nucleus of it all. Perfectly De Niro, LaMotta goes from jocular to irate as he hectors his brother, Joey (Joe Pesci) to punch him in the face. It's a biopic without the typical biopic arc. Sure, he ditches the woman (Lori Anne Flax) he's initially with for a new one, but besides that, it's an up-and-down of athletic success, alienating family without reconciliation, and ultimately rock-bottom without redemption. The camera work in the second Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes) scene and the final soliloquy are iconic.",

The story was written by Jake LaMotta, Joseph Carter and Peter Savage. The story follows a middleweight boxer also known as the Bronx Bull, during his professional career as well as his life outside of the ring. The film is black and white in order to replicate the time it took place between 1941 to the mid 1950's. Based in the Bronx, Jake's main goal remains at earning the title in his career as a professional fighter. All the while he ruins his life outside of his career and holds boxing above all else. He will do whatever it takes in order to get to the top without regard for his wife and child. Jake has a very violent demeanor that really affects many of the relationships in his life including his second wife Vickie LaMotta. This film portrayed the level of violence that was present during this time and how women were being treated by men who had superior levels of aggression when things didn't necessarily go the way they wanted them to. His levels of aggression then spiral to him being obsessively jealous towards Vickie and any sort of interaction she has with anyone which more often than not turns physical. After losing a fight and everything else he felt he had, it wasn't until two years later he was able to fight for the title spot against Marcel Cerdan. The jealousy with Vickey continues to tear apart not only Jake's marriage but his relationship with Joey as well. His level of anger becomes such a problem that it affects every aspect of his life. The following six years Jake retired and moved to Florida with Vicky and his three children after also gaining weight following his boxing career. He soon gets involved with underage girls and destroys his championship belt in order to gain money for his legal fees.The film wraps up with Jake seeing Joey again after years have passed and still Joey has anger towards all that Jake has done to him. Jake talking to himself in the mirror before a show, shows that men like Jake who have made all of these mistakes in their life can change and make their future better than it was and move on from their past choices and decisions. This film was an accurate representation of the time period and the forces that drove people like Jake to make bad decisions in their life outside of their work. You can tell by the way Jake acted affected everyone around him just by his presence and demeanor. He was able to find himself toward the end of the film and come to the realization that there was more to life than just boxing.",

The main characters were portrayed by Robert DeNiro, Catherine Moriarty, and Joe Pesci.  The films follows the story of Jake LaMotta, a middleweight boxer who's climb to the top in boxing leads to a spiraling downfall outside of the ring. Not only is the character of Jake LaMotta violent inside the ring, he is equally violent to his wives, neighbors, and ultimately his brother.  This ultimately leads to two divorces, an estrangement with his brother, and ultimately some jail time.  At the end of the film, he ends up doing stand-up comedy in a tiny nightclub.  The film was done in black and white to be authentic with the time (1940s), and the film score has a dramatic sad tone to it.  I would recommend this film for mature adults due to the intensity that the actors portray brilliantly.  DeNiro especially is thoroughly believable as a boxing star with a very violent nature.  Given the film's violent nature and constant profanity, the R rating is appropriate.",

            "content": "When Martin Scorsese accepted his Oscar, many of his fans felt a mixture of relief and disappointment. Oscar sticks a needle in the flesh, but it hurts just a little, whereas Scorsese cuts it; Oscar is redemption, Scorsese is dissection. Two different things. So, with \"Raging Bull,\" the Oscars can honor De Niro's heat and reject Scorsese's cold. \n\n Jake LaMotta, the middleweight boxing champion of the world in 1949, wrote an autobiography dissecting his life. De Niro recommended it to Scorsese, and the souls of three Italian-born New Yorkers resonated. At a time when Scorsese was troubled, addicted, divorced and on the verge of bankruptcy, reading the autobiography was like finding an outlet. \n\n La Motta fought his way up, very smoothly, the fist to the flesh of the scene in Scorsese's rapid editing is extremely tension, in order not to let the audience pay too much attention to the violence, had to change the color of the whole film to black and white. La Motta is a man who believes in using his fists, so when he complains that his hands are too small for a heavyweight, the sadness is genuine. \n\n Even if he made a mistake, for the sake of his future and the triad compromise a fake fist fight, but in the break room to cry on the head or let us forgive him. What is a good man, made a mistake, corrected, is a good man. Success takes a price, and when La Motta, with the world boxing belt on his back, went to the corner to console the loser, it was like watching a movie. \n\n Boxing is not a place to stay, and La Motta's departure confirms Hemingway's dictation: You can be destroyed, but you cannot be knocked down. There he was at the side of the ring bleeding from the nose, refusing to go down, swearing, just like old beauty always does. But fortunately, he still accepted, more mixed worse does not matter, first his own nightclub, and then to work as a stand-up clown, did not see how he lost. \n\n The year 1980 is not far from now, and even if the movie were about the 1940s, it would make a lot of sense for an \"up-and-coming\" man to beat his wife, even from a \"non-feminist\" perspective. Even if Vicky's kisses are a little flirty, La Motta's vinegar-eating is pretty headshaking. \n\n Well, if it is not petty, then La Motta must be thinking something wrong. The more he is obsessed with Vicky the more paranoid he is, the more he is obsessed with boxing the more he is obsessed with losing, the more he is obsessed with sensuality the more he is empty. Lamotta lost himself in the pressure of fame and fortune, and beating his wife was just one of the outward manifestations. \n\n There is no way back, can only carry forward, this is the life is not complete. Such a person, we can sympathize with but not completely sympathize with, hate also cannot hate completely. The kind of heroes and villains that are so familiar in movies are all gone, blended into a La Motta and a real person. \n\n No one is perfect. Every character makes mistakes. People who do not make mistakes cannot be trusted. It is like when La Motta went to jail and banged his head against the wall, it is like masochism, but it is not really a confession, it is a way to make sure I am not a jerk. So, no matter how gray, this movie still has a positive point. Everyone who has a dream will have a desire on their back; Every effort, behind is the struggle. \"I don't know whether man is guilty or not. All I know is that once I was blind but now, I can see, see through the truth\"",

            "content": "Raging Bull: A brutal, yet beautiful film \n\nWe all know Raging Bull exceeded expectations when we realize what the expectations were beforehand. The idea of the film came from Robert DeNiro who plays Jake LaMotta, a 1940's and 50's boxer who seems to be completely insecure about himself as a whole. Directed by Martin Scorsese, produced by Robert Chartoff, and written by Mardik Martin, the film unravels the life of one of the best fighters of all time. Before the film was considered for production, DeNiro had a rough time convincing Scorsese to be the director. However, eventually he found light when Chartoff said he'll produce it if Scorsese agrees to direct it. Scorsese almost dies from a drug overdose, leading him to a change of heart and a desire to make the film, eventually saving his own career and life. Raging Bull depicts the life of Jake LaMotta through moments in the ring and moments in life. The moments in life always trailed into the ring, because Jake experienced so many instances of insecurity whether it was women, family or moments of doubt within himself. He took everything out on his opponents and the ones around him. Moments like when he finally attains the unattainable, his wife Vicky. Jake marries Vicky, but then sees her as a slut after she sleeps with him. Why? He has a mind complex that any female who's not a virgin, is a whore. The instances in the movie where this is depicted are truly beautiful, because they're shot and done so well. Scorsese portrays the anger and frustration of LaMotta through facial expressions and emotions when he feels insecure about his relationship with Vicky. LaMotta believes that his own wife would be happier sleeping with other people rather than him, he eventually confronts her about sleeping with his brother. Completely outrageous. Jake was known as a vicious fighter in the ring, which came from his anger outside of the ring. But the movie never really delved deep into the fighting itself, its was a film about the boxer himself and his inability to conquer jealousy and insecurity. LaMotta fights himself for most of the movie, and in the end he comes to a realization that all the trouble he's caused is nobody else's fault. The production was a masterpiece in my opinion, every emotion was clear and brilliantly portrayed, from Jake's emotions to his wife's and even the other boxers, who were deathly afraid in the ring at times due to the viciousness in LaMotta's eyes. \n\n9/10. I had to get myself to like the movie, because I love sports and fighting movies are awesome, but it wasn't necessarily about the fighting itself. The movie took me on a journey, watching a character break himself down and learn how badly it hurt him in the end.",

            "content": "No target, the biggest killer in life——Appreciation of Raging Bull\nRaging Bull is a sports biopic directed by Martin Charles Scorsese in 1980. Robert Anthony De Niro Jr, who plays the leading role in this film, also won the Oscar for best actor.\nThe final subtitle of the film quotes a sentence in the Gospel of John, \"All I know is this: Once I was blind and now I can see\" This also summarizes the plot of the film. Young Jake is a boxer. He is invincible in the challenge arena, but he never qualified for the championship. He thinks he is unwilling to compromise with the mafia. Later, he married and had children, but because he could not play the championship, he became increasingly decadent. Later, because of his incompetence in reality, he became more and more angry. His life with his wife gradually collapsed, and even because he suspected his brother and wife, he fought against his brother, causing the two brothers to break up. One day, he was finally willing to compromise and won the championship he dreamed of. In the days that followed, Jake, who experienced many joys and sorrows, worked as a talk show actor in the bar and spent the rest of his life in this way.\nThis film is a very classic one. First of all, it uses black and white pictures, because the director Martin Scorsese believes that color film will fade after a long time. In order to make the film never fade, he simply uses black and white pictures at the beginning. The second reason is that he thinks the red boxing gloves are too conspicuous. The focus of this film is eight boxing matches, which is the turning point in the plot and also the turning point of Jake's fate. In addition, the boxing match itself is also an audio-visual feast. He doesn't want to be too eye-catching. In addition, some other technologies used in the film are also epoch-making. First, the camera revolved around the site and glided, which was quite novel in those days. The montage technique is used in the sound effect processing of the film. In the boxing match, strange howls and lightning are often mixed, jumping into silence and returning to reality, enriching the performance level of the film. After I watched the film, I thought the character Jake in the play made me very anxious and angry. I knew he was not a bad man, but I just couldn't sympathize with him.\nIn a word, the pictures, sound effects and clips of this film were later widely used as teaching materials. It is precisely because of the birth of such a good film that it can bring more inspiration to film lovers later, and also promote the emergence of more outstanding films later.",

The film was produced by Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff and starred the incredibly talented Robert De Niro. The film grossed nearly twenty-three and a half million dollars. \n\nThe story opens with a washed-up 1964 Jake LaMotta reciting lines in his dressing room about his glory days. Suddenly we are back to 1941, where Jake is getting pummeled in the ring. It looks like it will take a miracle for LaMotta to make it out of this fight, and yet less than a minute later, after a flurry of punches, his opponent is lifeless on the canvas. Still, after a rigged decision from the committee, Jake is down and out, losing the fight by unanimous decision. Later, we see Jake verbally assaulting his wife Irma and are let into this darker side of LaMotta's personality. His rage in the ring does not stop once he leaves but instead haunts him everywhere he goes. We see the further maltreatment of his wife as he pursues a young girl named Vickie, who turns out to be the cause of much conflict throughout the film. Jake's insecurities about his relationship with Vickie destroy many necessary relationships within his life. Tommy and Salvy try to help Jake get a title fight, but they part ways following a fight between Joey and them over Vickie.\nFurther into the movie, Jake becomes accusatory of Vickie, claiming she had an affair with Salvy and even his brother Joey. The fight that follows between him and Joey completely breaks the brother's relationship, and although Jake follows this up by punching Vickie, she agrees to stay with him. Showing how back then, the abuse and mistreatment of women was something that went unchecked. It is a weird thing to see on screen when we know how much has changed in today's society. I think the film does a good job touching on social issues at the time, mainly because LaMotta was involved with all walks of life. The style of the film leaves you wanting more, and the abrupt changes keep your eyes glued to the film. I would strongly recommend this to any fans of Scorsese or De Niro, especially boxing fans. I think the movie is very well put together and would say the choices made by the director and, obviously, De Niro brings this story to life.",

            "content": "While Raging Bull is often considered to be one of the best films ever made, and Scorsese's best collaboration with Robert De Niro, ultimately this film fell a bit flat with me. Perhaps I have been spoilt by the later works of Scorsese, but while the performance of De Niro was strong and the film was shot beautifully, I just felt no connection with this story and it struggled to hold my attention. I am also a product of a different generation, where boxing is mainly oversaturated in films rather than a popular and highly valued American sport. Maybe if I hadn't seen films such as Rocky, Creed, and The Fighter, I'd have been more enticed to learn more about Jake LaMotta's story but I found it wholly uninteresting. Given its status as such a highly regarded classic in film, I also went in with pretty high expectations. These were met in the technical aspects of the film – Scorcese's direction, Thelma Schoonmaker's editing, Michael Chapman's cinematography, production design, and De Niro's main role all excel in every way. Still, I struggled to engage or care with the material that was so well dressed by these masters of craft – which could very much just be a personal problem.\n\tJake LaMotta is not intended to be a sympathetic, heroic, or charismatic main character. The story of Raging Bull is one of self-destruction, as Jake LaMotta refuses to ever let himself live a nice life. The boxing matches are more compelling than the personal matters that drag on throughout the duration and slowly fester until LaMotta is left all alone and no longer has boxing. The events and drama seem to blur into one, providing little reason to become emotionally invested in any of the characters who don't seem to grow, change, or behave in any way that entices viewers to watch events unfold. There doesn't seem to be any sort of satisfaction is seeing LaMotta end up exactly where he deserves to be, which I might attribute to writing or perhaps the risk of creating a biographical drama on a real person. The depiction might possibly lose meaning in its endeavor to be true to LaMotta. Overall, I can see why this is a great film, but I feel it is bogged down in a lackluster story and little characterization. I would sooner rewatch other Scorsese films that handle the aforementioned aspects of film better and are equally excellent in their technical accomplishments.",

            "content": "Scorsese's First K.O.\n\nMartine Scorsese is one of the best directors at sympathizing agonized and tortured characters to viewers and Raging Bull is a perfect example of this genius. Scorsese, who just before making the film suffered from a cocaine overdose, could resonate with Jake LaMotta, a boxer with self-destructive tendencies. Robert DeNiro, who plays Jake LaMotta, and Martin Scorsese developed a bond that started in this movie and has continued to this day. In the movie, Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro) is a boxer in the 1980's who uses his rage and destructive tendencies in the boxing ring, but also in his relationships with love interest Vickie, played by Cathy Moriarty. He is constantly jealous and insecure that Vickie is interested in other men and the viewers can see his rage control him as he pours it out on his opponents in and out of the ring. Another big name in the film is Joe Pesci, who plays Joey LaMotta, Jake's brother and manager. Jake and Joey eventually come to blows as Jake suspects Joey of having relations with Vickie. A major theme throughout the movie is the self-destructive tendencies of a man who is plagued by insecurities of jealousy and rage. Time and time again, Jake LaMotta is his own worst enemy as he burns bridges and pours out his rage on people who care about him the most. Even though Jake is a character that people should despise, Scorsese has a talent of sympathizing the character throughout the movie. There are times that the viewers can see the torment that Jake LaMotta experiences and it is seen that he understands that he has self-destructive tendencies. The film forces the viewers to understand the ramifications of when individuals become their own worst enemy and does so in an extreme manner of rage and violence in the boxing ring. The film did not initially make shockwaves in the box office, however it was nominated for multiple awards and won multiple Academy awards. This film was a huge boost for Scorsese's career and years after he is one of the most famous directors, it is easy to look back at one of his first successful films and see his brush strokes on an early masterpiece.",

            "content": "Running with a raging bull!\n\nThe Raging Bull is a film directed by Martin Scorsese and with a star-studded cast including Robert De Niro playing Jake La Motta and Joe Pesci playing his brother Joey. The movie is based on the life events of Jake LaMotta a professional middleweight boxing champion. Jake is depicted as a man with a goal to become a world known boxer. He does not back down to anyone in the ring and even to those in his life. His path to greatness is encouraged by his brother Joey. Joey's encouragement as well as the encouragement of his close friends and love one is the reason why Jake is so demanding and does not take disappointment well. He tends to rage when he thinks he is being challenged hence the title of the movie. While the film is supposed to be centered on Jake, Joey is another stand out character for this unyielding loyalty for his brother even in spite of his knowing Jake was being \"bull- headed\". \nIn my opinion if you want to see a movie that is heavily based on siblings and an endless amount of encouragement this is the movie for you. If you don't mind a bit of gorge and a lot of internal battles this movie is also for you. The film has moments of close ups that makes you feel that you are immersed in the ring with Jake when he fights. These moments of close ups make the movie much more thrilling and keeps your attention throughout. I would recommend this movie not only for the story line but for the great acting done by Robert De Niro. He makes the scenes come to life with every punch he throws and towards the end of the film he shows a side of Jake LaMotta that make you feel that you had no idea who he really was in his life. There are moments in the film where Martin Scorsese signature filming technique of applying slow motion at the right time causes the viewer to take in every bit of the scene and feel the significant of that particular moment. With great directing and great acting this 2 hour film will not disappoint.",

            "content": "Raging Bull is a 1980's movie based on the book and life of Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) himself. It follows the story of his rise to fame and recognition in the boxing world as well as his demons in his own personal life. The director of the film was Martin Scorsese who was up and coming at the time, featuring actors such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Cathy Moriarty. I feel like most of the cinematography was standard for that time, but one part that stood out was the 2nd fight with Sugar Ray Leonard where Jake was standing against the ropes and just letting Sunny pound on him telling him he never put him on the mat. During this scene, they did a Point of View (POV) of Sunny from Jake's perspective as he is swinging on him with the distorted background. \nThe directors were good at catching the big moments in the film where they wanted to drive home raw human emotion such as when Jake attacks his brother Joey (Joe Pesci). We also see the struggles of up-and-coming fighters at the time with the crime families having such a pull in how fights were set up and who got the shot at the title. Jake wanted nothing to do with them, but without their help, he understood he would be stuck, also coming to terms with never being in the heavyweight division due to his size. I love the fact we can flash forward and see the extended effect of crime families on boxing and how they recruited people from tough upbringings and shape them into who they wanted. This can be seen later in the 1960s when Sonny Liston becomes heavyweight champion and had ties with the mob as an enforcer. \nMy overall rating of this movie is a 4 out of 5 stars, I would recommend this to someone who was a sports history fan or likes dramas from the 1940s. You can see how traditional roles were treated for men and women with how the interactions between Jake and his wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty). In conclusion, this was an interesting film between the sports aspect of a professional who was trying to reach the top without anyone else's help, and his waxing poetic later on as he comes to a realization of reaching the end of his career. His ups and downs gave him perspective on life and to not take everything he had for granted which was symbolized by the ending quote for the movie.",

First off, I can't not mention that a lot of the dialogue seemed rather mumbled or otherwise spoken somewhat quickly and quietly, which while it may have a certain authenticity to it, I did find it a little hard to follow everything said at times, which is never ideal for me, as a viewer.\n\nHowever, Robert De Niro undoubtedly gives a decent performance in the main role and almost equally so does Joe Pesci as Joey. I quite liked how honest and straightforward Joey was, as a character. I also found myself feeling quite frustrated and sorry for the wife, Vickie La Motta (played by Cathy Moriarty). Goodness knows how many women have been in her position - I wouldn't wish that on anyone.\n\nThere are, I suppose, some predictable elements to the plot but it felt a mostly well made film, with a clear message in terms of the downside to making a sport your passionate about, the main focus in life. Nowadays there are so many sports films but I know that this one is particularly well regarded. To me, I wouldn't say its one of the best films around but its certainly not bad either. I quite enjoyed watching it to see De Niro as a much younger actor at the time, if for no other reason. Personally, The King of Comedy is my favourite film of his but that's just my opinion of course.\n\nRegardless of all that, yes I would recommend this film, for the fact its in black and white and that gives it a somewhat classic type of a feel to it but I wouldn't raise your expectations especially high either. Its an interesting and reasonably well made film, which I'd recommend on that basis.",

Surely, it can be convincingly argued that \"Raging Bull\" is a masterwork in terms of the heightened dramatization of its subject matter which is achieved through the sheer force of editing alone. At the same time, we observe an inherently compelling concept at the root of its theme; namely the shocking captivity of one man to the pathology of his own anger, paranoia, and self-loathing. There is an operatic quality to the fight sequences which is intermittently brutal and quietly cathartic, achieving unexpected moments of almost transcendent elegance. All strengths considered, I must attest to coming away from the film feeling slightly underwhelmed by its characters. More particularly, in La Motta we're shown a bestial entity perpetually engaged in self-purification through expressions of anger, yet we're offered no insight into the source of that rage. He is merely a brute without the benefit of any additional dimensions to round him out and engage our interest or understanding. For such reasons, I'm slightly shocked to see \"Raging Bull\" so consistently proclaimed as one of the greatest films of all time; it most assuredly is not. It is, however, a bold, ambitious, and ultimately unforgettable depiction of the poetry of the boxing ring enacted within one man's turbulent spirit and expressed through the most merciless eloquence of his fists.",

But I could not get over the feeling that De Niro was looking an awful lot like James Caan in \"The Godfather\"; in fact, I thought Joe Pesci's portrayal was far more original. (Although, de Niro's portrayal of the aged Jake LaMotta was excellent.) The boxing fights were beautifully crafted, but I must confess that I liked the fights in the Rocky films much better. (Maybe I just love color and kitsch.) Although this probably is a great film, I cannot say that my life was enriched by watching it: I found Jake LaMotta to be a thoroughly repulsive and unsympathetic character and that the movie only evokes successive feelings of nausea, whether it is the characters or the violence.

            "content": "A tour de force from Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci.\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese's sports biographical drama Raging Bull (1980) is a fearsome picture from Scorsese about an unlikable man named Jake LaMotta, who went from legit boxing legend to pathetic comedy stand-up doing cringe-inducing jokes in little nightclubs. Scorsese gives you the man's home life flux and boxing career highlights with a visceral, dreamy directorial style all his own. No one directs like Scorsese and Raging Bull is some of his finest and sharpest filmmaking.\n\nWriters Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin allow you into the troubled mind of a hopeful boxer with a cruel punching method of wearing down his opponents with vicious hits, while he himself gets clobbered mercilessly. Raging Bull is not about the boxing matches, but about how long they went on and with what brutality this bloodsport contains, much like Jake LaMotta's own life of bullying and violence. Raging Bull is all about Jake LaMotta's fiercely combative personality that ruins his life rather than his cruel boxing style. Meanwhile, composer Pietro Mascagni delivers only beauty with his entrancing symphonic score that is romantic, epic, and sincere. Mascagni's melodies soar above all the blood and bruises, adding an elegance to Scorsese's Raging Bull.\n\nScorsese's direction is impeccable with a stellar creativity in filming each boxing sequence like it's a magic show or something. Unique angles, panning shots, and long held close-ups ensures Raging Bull stays with you with a gorgeous black and white aesthetic that still shows all the sweat and blood. Michael Chapman's cinematography has all these wonderful shots from the zoom out on Sugar Ray Chapman surrounded by smoke in an ethereal first person shot from Jake's perspective to Vicki splashing her feet in a local pool to show her underage youth and playful personality. \n\nThelma Schoonmaker's first collaboration with Martin Scorsese starts with Raging Bull and her cuts are so sharp and entertaining. From Jake needing a punch in the face to Thelma cutting to him getting beaten in a boxing match and so forth with her effortlessly clever cuts to her steady pacing that keeps Raging Bull's 129 rush by like a knockout punch!\n\nScorsese sympathizes with this lumbering brute and all his inner turmoil, constant doubt, increasing paranoia, endless jealousy, brutal violence, and cruel domestic abuse with a fair and balanced direction for Raging Bull. You see Jake LaMotta's fearsome rage in every word, glare, and punch of Robert De Niro's leading role. De Niro captures Jake LaMotta's flurry of swift punishing punches, brutal manner, distrusting nature, disgusting sexism, commanding gravitas, cringe humor, and fearful paranoia all with ease. He's easy to hate and difficult to understand, but Scorsese lets you witness LaMotta's boxing glory days to his embarrassing low moments in one of Scorsese's greatest pictures: Raging Bull.\n\nJoe Pesci steals the show as Joey LaMotta, Jake's brother and trainer, who manages to push his brother to stardom and success, all while dealing with Jake's incessant temper tantrums and vicious assaults. I love seeing Pesci go from quiet and patient to bursting with violence and righteous indignation at Jake's mean taunts and shocking violence. I appreciate how Pesci is subtle as portraying Joey's frustrations with Jake's rage with his incredulous faces and aghast expressions. \n\nPesci is fascinating to watch throughout Raging Bull as Joey starts out empathetic and measured with his reassurations and pep talks to De Niro's Jake LaMotta, but you see Pesci's Joey cheating on his wife and belittling her just like how Jake treats his poor wife Vicki LaMotta as beautifully portrayed by Cathy Moriarty. She is perfect as the flirty and forlorn Vicki as she must succumb to Jake's every wish and order until she's had enough. Moriarty plays each moment with a knowing that lets you know Vicki understands every jealous question and hurtful comment made by Jake cuts deeply.\n\nFrank Vincent is great as the two-faced goon Salvy with his compliments to Jake's face, then insults behind his back to all his friends. Nicholas Colasanto is excellent as the Godfather type mafia boss Tommy Como with his boxing demands and ever present presence in Jake's life and career. Theresa Saldana is gorgeous as Joey's wife Lenore. You feel so sorry for her just like Cathy Moriarty's Vicki as she is mistreated horribly by these wretched men. \n\nJohn Turturro cameos as a man at the same club table as Salvy and Tommy early in his acting career. Martin Scorsese's father Charles Scorsese cameos as Charlie when Tommy visits Jake in his apartment. Martin Scorsese himself has a cameo as a club stagehand later on in Raging Bull. Johnny Barnes is captivating as Sugar Ray Robinson opposite Robert De Niro's barrelling Jake LaMotta. Michael Westmore and Mike Maggi's make-up transforms De Niro into Jake LaMotta with a broader nose, torn eye gashes, beat up marks, and fat additions to capture LaMotta's weight gains and losses throughout the years. Richard Bruno, Marilyn Putnam, Robert Iannacconne, and Andrea E. Weaver's costumes fit the 1940's and 1950's eras from the boxing uniforms to the nightlife scene's tight lavish dresses and slick suits.\n\nIn all, Raging Bull is a rush of blood to the head like one of Jake LaMotta's legendary boxing bouts. Martin Scorsese at his peak technical prowess with powerful acting all over Raging Bull.",

A fitting time for waring, raging and unrest.  The story is centered around the life and career of the late Jake La Motta. The movie is filmed in black and white which tells the tale of the time, in most of the scenes there are catholic emblems in the background relating to the dense Italian Catholic population in New York.  The films capture a part of history built around the Machismo culture centered around sports, violence, money, power and adultery. The scenes were intense it showed raging quick-tempered crowds, bar and restaurant fights and serval domestic disputes. The characters are true to their form, hot-tempered tough guys who show heavy family presence and who supported each other. This was shown in the relationship of the two brother Joey being Jake's manager reflected family relationships in a close community. Everyone knew everyone and respect was big deal, you do as you told or else there will be trouble. An example of this was shown in the scene where Joey tells Jake that he has to throw the fight for a benefit of a gambling win. Jake living up to his reputation struggled with the fact of being told what to do hence the line \"I don't go down for nobody\". The film also portrays the physiological effects of a career-based sport, the high-priced mental and physical intensity it takes on the body. You see the main character struggle with weight gain issues and the lack of attention given to his mental stability. The Director does a fantastic job by intensifying the emotions of this era throw the real-life events taking place. I would definitely rate this movie at 4.5 stars because of the attention to detail given when capturing the real-life events of a professional boxer and the physical sacrifice they make to satisfy others financially. \"I'm in here breaking my ass, not them\" (La Motta,1940).",

His goal is to become the middleweight boxer champion with the help of his brother and manager Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci). However, fame, the mafia, and his relationship with his second wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) are not going to make it easy. \n\nThe characterization of Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta is one of the strongest highlights of the film, the changes of his physical appearance throughout the story are remarkable as he gained muscle and weight for the filming. This along with the extraordinary makeup and camera work make the fights more authentic and powerful.  \n\nI would like to point out how other topics of the movie apart from boxing like domestic violence and uncontrolled anger are well discussed and represented. Jake LaMotta's distrust in his wife Vickie makes him be violent against her, and conditions his fights. Throughout the film, we are constantly living realistic situations in which Jake hits Vickie, Joey, or breaks down doors because of his suspicion that Vickie is sleeping with other men.  \n\nEven though color movies were already being made, Scorsese decided to do it in black and white making it stand out from the other films, I liked that he introduced a short sequence of colored recordings when he got married to Vickie showing the few moments when he was happy and did not argue with her. He gave a lot of importance to the timeline of the story and the evolution of Jake as a person. \n\nAs I mentioned before, the camera work is a fundamental element for the film, for example, the angle is showing the public who is dominating the fight, when Jake is asking Joey to hit him, Jake is always above Joey. In the fights in the ring, Scorsese uses long shots when the boxers are thinking and close-up shots when they are fighting, transmitting an asphyxia feeling. \n\nScorsese uses other resources like sound and lighting to transmit and complement the emotions and background of the characters. For instance, the movie starts with the opera \"Cavalleira Rusticana\" commonly used in the genre Verismo that focused on low-class characters. However, the synchronization and the sound of the punches was slightly artificial, it did not sound realistic. \n\nIn conclusion, I really recommend this movie, it has many hidden symbols that tell a story by themselves. It focuses much more than boxing, making it distinctive and worth seeing it.",

Him and his brother, who is his manager, navigate finding the tough balance between there professional and personal lives. There is also an interesting story regarding the battle Jake has with himself. There is a clear self-confidence issue that Jake deals with throughout the movie often portraying that he feels like he is not good enough and that the only way for him to feel as if he is a great boxer is to do everything himself. The film not only highlights the intricoes of the life of a boxer, but also touches on the complexity of the boxing landscape in the 1940' and 1950's. The film's ability to cover a longtime frame whiles remaining concise and easy to understand is amazing directing by Scorsese. There is amazing cinematography in this film especially in the boxing scenes as the camera work highlights the speed and stress that is present in the ring while maintaining the feeling that Jake is completely comfortable in this environment. The effects and fight sequences a make the fights seem real as if the actors are getting hit. There are however some places where the special effects are slightly overdone with blood shooting out of fighters faces, but in my opinion, this adds to the drama of the fight. There is an interesting theme that is presented where it seems as if the only place Jake feels comfortable and like himself is when he is fighting and getting hit and when he is outside the ring his life is too complicated. The film overall is an incredible story that has the viewer buy into the characters' lives early on and takes the viewer on an emotional journey of ups and downs as Jake navigates his career. The ability of Scorsese to so clearly depict the life of a boxer and highlight all the hardships they delt with was truly amazing and draws the viewer in to a point where it is hard to look away from the screen.

            "content": "Raging Bull is a 1980 film directed by Martin Scorsese starring Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, Joe Pesci as Joey, and Cathy Moriarty as Vickie LaMotta. The movie was produced by Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler with a screenplay written by Paul Shrader and Mardik Martin. The film is based on the book by Jake LaMotta, Joseph Carter, and Peter Savage, and tells the true story of LaMotta's life as a boxer in the 1940s and 50s. LaMotta's rage often serves him well inside the boxing ring, but he is unable to maintain the stability he craves outside of the ring due to his self-destructive tendencies. \n\tProduction highlights include remarkable cinematography by Michael Chapman and sound effects by sound effects supervising editor Frank Warner. Chapman's immersive camerawork takes the viewer inside the boxing ring, quickly cutting back and forth between point of view shots to match the rate of the boxer's punches. Warner's impeccable sound editing adds to the realism of Chapman's cinematography during each match. The loud punches, audience screams, and camera flashes punctuate a muted background track that sounds like a train rushing by, while rare moments of silence interrupt the heightened volume of each fight. Scorsese's decision to shoot the film in black and white adds to the film's realism as well, as boxing in the 1940s typically aired in black and white on television. Color appears in the movie only once, during a montage depicting rare moments of happiness and stability in LaMotta's personal life such as his marriage to Vicki. Unfortunately, LaMotta's jealousy and rage get in the way of the bright future he craves. \n\tRobert De Niro certainly deserves the best actor Oscar he won for his portrayal of Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull. LaMotta is a complex character filled with imperfections and De Niro's exquisite portrayal allows the audience to become invested in a character with questionable morals who can't contain his fighting to the ring. De Niro's training for the role is evident in the realistic boxing scenes and his 60-pound weight gain in the second half of the film demonstrates his deep commitment to the role. \n\tOverall, I highly recommend this film to all viewers, even those who are not boxing fans. The film is notable for Scorsese's excellent direction and De Niro's superb performance. Although the movie is long, the fast-paced action escalates quickly and is likely to leave viewers on the edge of their seats. \nRaging Bull is an intergenerationally relevant film due to its relatable examination of the imperfections and contradictions of the human existence. LaMotta strives to find balance between his lives in and out of the boxing ring, but at the end of the day, he is unable to get out of his own way.",

É difícil dizer do que exatamente se trata este filme. O enredo narrativo é bastante direto, segue a vida de um boxeador dos anos 1940-50. O filme também explora muitas das questões complexas da violência contra as mulheres e da destruição psicológica de um homem que não consegue aceitar ou compreender a intimidade. A verdadeira magia é que essas questões são expressas por meio das explosões psicológicas distorcidas do personagem de De Niro. Todos ao redor de LaMotto podem ver seu problema, sua obsessão doentia e suspeita, mas ele não consegue se conter. O filme encontra sua expressão na imaturidade emocional do personagem principal. LaMotto não pode avaliar introspectivamente suas emoções. Seu processo de pensamento é infinitamente fascinante de assistir enquanto ele transforma qualquer ato de bondade ou amor em traição e distância. Ele carece de maturidade emocional ou consciência para comunicar suas frustrações em palavras. O público simplesmente observa enquanto qualquer pequeno ato ou suspeita é uma janela para ele confirmar o que ele mais deseja, a confirmação de que seu parceiro é infiel e, por extensão, ele próprio é indigno. Seu ódio é profundo, não um ódio dos outros ou do que ele ataca, mas um ódio de si mesmo. Todos ao seu redor percebem, mas LaMotto simplesmente não consegue. O filme oferece o olho para os detalhes que tornou Scorsese famoso. As cenas de luta de boxe são brilhantes e brutais. O elenco de apoio também é excelente.",

Desperately compelled to assert his manliness, LaMotta reveals himself to be deeply insecure, worrying constantly about his appearance and his weight (traditionally the woes of women), while violently lashing out like a cornered animal at anyone who threatens to emasculate him. As such, the lesson here, which he of course never learns, is that chauvinistic machismo ultimately undercuts itself, that all masculinity is inherently toxic because it is always at cross-purposes with itself, and that the injunction to prove one's manhood ends up proving how little meaning there really is to being a man at all.",

            "content": "The famous and very talented director of Raging Bull is Martin Scorsese. Scorsese's ability to create such a masterpiece is truly incredible. The way that he directed certain scenes to exhibit the tension and jealousy that Jake LaMotta was feeling really triggered the emotions of the audience. However, Jake LaMotta's character was played by the one and only Robert DeNiro who did a fabulous job by truly stepping into Jake's character. Another key player in this film was Vickie, Jake's lover and then wife which was acted by Cathy Moriarty. Joey, another key player in the Raging Bull, was played by Joe Pesci. The movie is based on a memoir written by the real Jake LaMotta himself. Producer credits go out to Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler. \n\n\n\nThe Raging Bull is definitely not about boxing, however, it revolves around boxing. The movie begins with Jake LaMotta having a flashback of what happened in his life twenty years prior. Jake is a professional boxer who has a close relationship with his brother, Joey, who assists in setting up the boxing matches. Jake sees the beautiful Vickie for the first time and they begin their relationship. There is a lot of boxing going on through this film, however that is not what the story line is about. Jake becomes obsessed with Vickie and is constantly accusing her of flirting with other men. The film definitely depicts Vickie talking and flirting with other men, even though the movie never shows her actually cheating. The assumptions that Jake creates in his mind about Vickie are eating him alive and it is vividly expressed when he fights in the ring. Jake's insecurities get the best of him resulting in him being very abusive to Vickie. He even accuses Vickie of sleeping with his brother, which is where it all goes downhill. He loses a fight against Sugar, ruins his relationship with his brother and within a few years Vickie cannot deal with Jake anymore and asks for a divorce. The movie shows Jake's ultimate low when he is in jail and that is where he realizes that he pushed everyone away because of his anger and insecurities. \n\n\n\nRaging Bull is definitely a very dark film depicting the emotions that Jake is facing, but expressing them in the ring. I definitely think that this movies production highlights were positive because the way that everything was played out truly makes the audience realize that there are people in society who are facing these insecurities resulting in them self-destructing their life. The music allowed the audience to feel a certain way at that time which I definitely allowed the tension of the film to build up. This film won many awards along with the actors in it. \n\n\nWhen I first started this movie I thought it was going to be a boxing movie. Even though there was a lot of boxing going on, this movie was about someone truly battling their deepest darkest thoughts. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not watched it because it is so raw and intense. Even though it does not have a happy ending, you definitely feel for all the characters.\n\n\nRaging Bull was definitely a film I will never forget watching because I've never seen a movie like it before. Martin Scorsese did just a phenomenal job, along with the producers and the actors. The authenticity and realness in this film truly makes it a classic.",

            "content": "Raging Bull, directed by Martin Scorsese, follows the rise and fall of middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta. Jake, played by Robert De Niro, excels in the boxing ring, but struggles to positively interact with friends and family. His brother Joey, played by Joe Pesci, supports his brother in \nhis boxing, but is slowly pushed away by Jake's increasing anger. \n\nWhen I started watching Raging Bull, I was expecting a regular sports film. The protagonist finds a challenge, trains, and overcomes that challenge. In a way, that does happen in Raging Bull. Jake does successfully become the boxing champion. But that is clearly not what the film is about. The tone during the boxing matches compared to Jake's home life is completely different. In the ring, Jake is confident, but when at home he is paranoid. It's also incredible to see how different Jake is during different parts of his life. After retiring, it is clear that Jake is nowhere near as fit. It's amazing that Robert De Niro was able to appear to go through what looks like years of change in the matter of a couple of minutes. \n\nI found the use of black and white filming to be really interesting. The world knew Jake LaMotta through his black and white boxing matches, so it is fitting they should learn the ugly reality of his life through the same lens. The black and white also gives the film the appearance of a much older film. It almost feels like it could been actual footage of Jake's life. I also appreciated the small use of color to indicate the usage of footage styled as taken by a home video camera. The color really makes it distinct from the rest of the film. In addition, The home footage does a great job showing a large passage of time, and indicating a transition in Jake's life. \n\nOverall, Raging Bull was a very stylized an unique experience. It really felt like it was filmed in Jake LaMotta's boxing days, and not decades later. I would recommend watching Raging Bull as a very different style of sports movie.",

The movie depicts his life inside and outside the ring both very violent. We see him as a husband, brother and father throughout the film. Although he was quite successful in the ring he was not in his personal life. The violence he experienced within the ring followed him in his personal life along with some insecurities which led to his demise. With his brother by his side he rose to middle weight boxer fame but lost it all due to his personal demons.\n\n\nRaging Bull is a film directed and written by Martin Scorsese the movie started out with him in modern times after his fighting career then it went back into time. I think some of the things that could have been flushed out more was not. The first wife scene to me was interesting but the movie did not fully flush out what happened to that marriage to get him to the new marriage. Another thing I thought was missed was how he interacted with his children we saw how he was with his spouse but nothing to indicate what his relationship was with his kids. I was left wondering to what extent did he work with the mob. Overall this is a very good movie although his profession was a boxer its not a boxing film, the movie digs deep into his life outside the ring as well to help paint a well-rounded picture of who this man was. The movie starts in the present but it quickly takes you back to the past to help unravel how this guy got the point we start.  I highly recommend this movie if you want to see a well told story of a man's life and the fact that its shot in black and white helps you feel as though your back in this time in American history. Roberta DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty performances were believable and you felt something for each character as the story unfolded.",

            "content": "One winter morning, many years ago now, I sat down to watch Raging Bull. I had seen it before and had enjoyed it. But this time was different as I was suffering hang-over guilt from an incident the night before. It was in this state of mind that I experienced the Jake La Motta (De Niro) story and gained a greater understanding of what I believe Scorsese was trying to say through this character.\n\nRaging Bull can simply be viewed as a sports film on a par with its contemporary, Rocky. You may think it a bio-epic merely charting the life of Jake La Motta (De Niro). But no, this film digs a lot deeper, exploring themes that can be recognized universally – well, mainly by those with a Y chromosome, as the premise of the film deals with troubled male identity. This is apparent in the character of Jake La Motta and also, to a lesser extent, his bother Joey (Pesci). This is why I, sitting in a pit somewhere in England, like many flawed men, can make a personal connection with the film's anti-hero, even though it is set in the Italian ghettos of New York City in the 1940s.\n\nThe story of Raging Bull begins in the later stages of Jake La Motta's life. He stands alone in a dressing room, overweight and repulsive, a shadow of his former self, framed so as to seem cornered-in. Smash-cut to the younger Jake La Motta, again cornered-in, but this time in the boxing ring. From there on in, Scorsese begins the Jake La Motta story, bringing the audience right into his demonic world. We are taken through his boxing career, his relationships with his wife Vicky (Moriarty) and his brother Joey (Pesci). We witness his attempts at night club management and then as a stand-up comic. Jake fails at everything, his spiral downwards portrayed so brilliantly and so convincingly that you can't help feel a slither of sympathy for this most wretched of humans. Ultimately, it is Scorsese's genius for subtle yet powerful story-telling that makes Raging Bull a classic.\n\nThe character of Jake La Motta is brilliantly brought to life both in Scorsese's direction and De Niro's performance. De Niro underplays the role and gives the character a strong physical presence. Indeed, his performance brings a new meaning to the concept of the method; he gained weight for the later part of the film, putting the shooting schedule on hold! The subtlety in direction and performance can be viewed in the scene where Jake first confronts his brother. \"Did you fuck my wife?\" This accusation comes out of nowhere, but yet, throughout the narrative, we have slowly begun building to this paranoid deluded moment. Through La Motta's characterisation, we know the psychology behind his actions. He is an obsessive. Once he gets a thought in his head, that's it. He only sees what he wants to see, without reason – whether it's to do with his constant eating or what he believes to be his wife's deception.\n\nScorsese's characters are often in need of redemption. La Motta is a hybrid of both Charley from Mean Streets (1973), sharing his need for painful retribution, and Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976), with his psychotic obsession.\n\nScorsese uses the camera as a subjective tool. As in Taxi Driver, slo-mo is used to convey the murky world of the streets of New York. In Raging Bull, it also helps us see events from La Motta's point of view – when his eyes first latch onto the young Vicki, for example. Michael Chapman, the film's cinematographer, is responsible for the film's stark black-white look. This style gave it an edge, especially in what can easily be argued as Raging Bull's best scene. Jack La Motta has been jailed for selling alcohol to minors. We see a single shard of light spill into an otherwise jet-black cell. Jake is alone. He has no-one left to fight. His wife has left him, his brother has gone and his boxing career is long over. And so, he begins to repeatedly punch the wall over and over, screaming, \"Why? Why? Why?\"\n\nI think what one will take away from this film is the absorbing drama of the fight scenes, completely unlike that of Rocky (1976) and Rocky 2 (1979). In Rocky, we watch the film as a spectator would watch any sport. But in Raging Bull, we feel every jab and hook; we are right there in the ring with Jake. We feel his brutal punishment. Again, this is due to the fantastic photography by Michael Chapman and the Oscar-winning skills of Thelma Schoonmaker who edited the film.\n\nThis film was no doubt another personal journey for Martin Scorsese, made in the hang-over period from his previous work, New York, New York (1977). During the latter's production, Scorsese was heavily into cocaine. The film received grave criticism and caused Scorsese to fall victim to profound depression. Previously, De Niro had approached Scorsese to make the life story of Jake La Motta and Scorsese had rejected it. It was only when he saw La Motta's self-destructive side that he made a personal connection with the subject. So, armed with Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader's script, (Scorsese had previously collaborated with Martin on Mean Streets and Schrader on Taxi Driver), Scorsese set about crafting Raging Bull like this was to be his last film. A labour of love, if you will!When first released, Raging Bull was heavily criticised for its violent imagery and it was not a box office hit. However, it was nominated for a string of Oscars but only picked up two for Best Actor and Best Editing. Scorsese lost Best Director to Robert Redford for Ordinary People (1980). But which one has had a greater cultural cinematic impact? Nevertheless, Raging Bull was voted as the best film of the decade of 1980s. A repense – unsurprisingly, as this was the decade of Polished bloc-buster. Raging Bull surpasses all of them, and their kind, in every aspect of the film-making process.\n\nWithout a doubt 5 Raging Bulls out of 5.",

This film is legitimately gritty, we see how horrifying Jake LaMotta was as a human being and how this effected his wife, his brother and himself. The black-and-white cinematography is some of the most beautiful I have ever seen and Robert De Niro gives arguably his greatest performance in the lead role with a level of commitment seen in very few performances. This is deserving of the swaths of praise it receives because it is truly brilliant in it's storytelling, acting and it's honesty, Scorsese is on top form as he builds one of his greatest masterpieces.\n\nThe film concerns the violent and unpleasant loser Jake \"The Raging Bull\" LaMotta as his boxing career rises and falls and his relationships with his wife and brother deteriorate. He is violent both in the ring and out of it and his jealousy over his second wife Vickie, Cathy Moriarty, threatens to derail their relationship and his sanity. We see immediately that he is dumb and shallow but desperate to win fights and willing to take abuse in order to be a champion. We never root for him but are depressed by the complete hopelessness of his situation by the end of the film.\n\nThe most beautiful element of the film is the cinematography which nears perfection. The grittiness of the black-and-white fits the tone of the film and the scars and scratches that develop on Jake and Cathy's faces have an extra texture to them that make them look like they exist in a 1940s film, the era in which the film is set, like Champion (1949), although De Niro's facial scars are a lot more convincing than those that appear on Kirk Douglas' face. Simple shots of men arguing in the street also appear extremely beautiful, with a creamy, sharp look to each frame that is different to the usual background shots in a sports film. The boxing matches are where the cinematography really gets to shine as the blood squirting out of De Niro's face and the devastating blow of the opposing boxer's gloves differentiates this film, again, from your average sports biopic. The fights feel more visceral and Jake's trauma more painful when we have a vivid image in our minds of what has caused his suffering.\n\nThe portrayal of LaMotta also defies convention as he is not a ï¿ 1/2~flawed' character who gains redemption through a good woman or a training montage, he is a horrible monster from the beginning and we see him get punished for his action whilst those around him continue to suffer. In comparison to Rocky (1976), the other film considered the greatest boxing film of all time, which glorifies the main character and sees him fall in love with a good woman and achieve redemption through stepping away from his amoral job and working hard to chase his dreams. If anything Raging Bull causes you to fear the central character and root for those around him to leave him, the only gratifying moment in the film occurs when Vickie finally leaves him, and this makes the film feel honest in a way that Rocky feels false. Another crucial difference is the ending, in Rocky he loses the fight but we end without seeing what Rocky's life after the fight is like, in Raging Bull we see De Niro give the famous Marlon Brando monologue from On the Waterfront (1994) and we understand how destitute he is. These differences are crucial because Raging Bull sets out not wanting to glamorize the lead character but to show how the darkness inside him is his downfall, had the film conformed to clichï¿ 1/2 (C)s this effect would have been damaged.\n\nDe Niro is absolutely brilliant, not only in the moments when he gets to ham it up but also in showing a man who is just barely able to project the image of a sane individual whilst simmering with rage just below the surface. Much like Taxi Driver (1976) he makes us incredibly uncomfortable, as he lasciviously kisses two 14-year olds in a bar that he owns, and he is able to go big when it is necessary, we see him punch his wife in a horrifying scene. This was a fully deserved Best Actor win and this is a performance that makes the case for De Niro being one of the greatest actors of all time. Moriarty is sad as the beautiful young woman who becomes an abused wife and her deep voice and deadpan delivery help to normalize a terrible situation in a scarily effective way. Pesci employs his usual shtick in playing LaMotta's brother and is part of one of the best directed scenes in the film in which an enemy of the brothers has his head smashed by a taxi door. Scorsese is famed for getting great performances out of actors and although I would place Ellen Burstyn in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) above De Niro's in this film he is still one of the all-time greats.\n\nIf it is not already clear you should definitely watch this film because everything about it is so well executed, from the cinematography to the acting. I wouldn't say I enjoyed it but it amazed me as a cinematic experience and the images of De Niro being punched will stay in my mind forever. This is one of Scorsese's greatest, better than The Departed (2006) but not as great as Goodfellas (1990). That is why it is his fifth best film.",

The film was written by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader; based off of the autobiography ï¿ 1/2 1/2~Raging Bull: My Storyï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM) by Jake LaMotta. It was produced by Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler. It first aired in 1980. The film ï¿ 1/2 1/2~Raging Bullï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM) is a story about an Italian American Boxer named Jake LaMotta and his rise to becoming the middleweight boxing champion in the 1940s. The movie begins with him training in a boxing ring as music often present within ï¿ 1/2 1/2~mob filmsï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM) plays as the soundtrack. The story starts at an Italian neighborhood in the Bronx, NY. Jake LaMotta, played by Robert DeNiro, is a young short tempered boxer whom is trying to get his chance at a title championship. His brother Joey LaMotta, played by Joe Pesci, is his manager and trainer. He does everything to help Jake get better at boxing, including setting up the matches, dealing with the politics of boxing, as well as helping him train. The film progresses as chapters in Jakeï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s life marked by his famous boxing matches or the years after his career. Early in the film the characters Jake and Joey are sitting by a public pool in their neighborhood, and Jake notices a young woman named Vickie, played by Cathy Moriarty. Although Jake is already married, he asks Joey about her and shows interest. Jake is a very aggressive hot headed man, whom seems to have issues with women as he continues to abuse his first wife early in life, as well as second later. His short temper frequently is cooled down by his brother as he assaults various people including his wife. The movie does not address whether Jake got a divorce from his first wife, or when it occurred. However, he decides to romantically peruse the young woman named Vickie from his neighborhood, whom he eventually marries. Jake is constantly trying to be the best boxer, a boxer whom has never been knocked out and only wins matches he is put into. \n\nThroughout the film, the boxing scene in the 1940s is portrayed as heavily influenced by the Italian mafia. Instances of games being fixed, and Jake needing the support of the local mob bosses is a running theme. As the film progresses Jake continues to win his matches and pushes his training harder until finally he is able to fight for the middleweight championship title, and wins. Conflicts continue to arise for Jake as he is extremely aggressive, paranoid, and jealous of any man potentially connected to his new wife Vickie. One evening Joey sees Vickie getting dinner with some ï¿ 1/2 1/2~old friendsï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM) from the neighborhood. A mobster named Salvy, played by Frank Vincent, is at the table with other men when Joey walks up to her knowing how Jake will view this dinner. She argues with him and returns to the table. At this point Joey tries to get her to leave the venue when Salvy steps in and says there is nothing going on its just an innocent dinner, Joey does not believe that and beats Salvy half to death. This conflict becomes such a big deal that Joey has to have a ï¿ 1/2 1/2~sit downï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM) with the local mob boss Tommy Como, played by Nicholas Colasanto. This meeting was to clear the air and prevent any retaliation against Joey and his brother, it is also discussed that the whole matter be kept under wraps from Jake; as everyone was aware of his temper. The Italian mafia seems to be protecting their asset, a rising Italian American boxer with ties to their organization. \n\nJake LaMottaï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s violence and paranoia ultimately culminate to the point where he believes everyone has slept with his wife, resulting in him beating up his brother Jake, his wife Vickie, and anyone whom he suspected she could be interested in. An example of this is when Vickie says one comment that people think this other boxer is cute; the moment Jake gets a chance to fight this other boxer in the ring, he violently destroys his face and wins the match. This turning point in the film occurs after Jakes success in the middleweight championship, as his life continues to break apart as a result of his paranoia unchecked anger. As Jakeï¿ 1/2 1/2(TM)s career as a boxer starts to wane, he decides to open a club/restaurant. He performs comedy there as well as hosts other entertainers. After years of abuse, his wife Vickie decides to leave him and take sole custody of their kids. Joey is still not speaking with Jake since the day he beat him up over his paranoias, but they ultimately speak again near the end of the film. Jakes life continues to get worse when he gets in trouble with the law for serving underage girls at his club. His finances become so strained that he tries selling the jewels from his championship belt, but is unable to come up with enough to pay the fines, resulting in additional legal action against him. \nCONT...",

            "content": "Based on the life of boxer Jake LaMotta, Raging Bull is another awesome film directed by Martin Scorsese which doesn't disappoint. Something that stands out from the beginning of the movie is that it was filmed in black and white - a big risk taken by Scorsese, yet the right choice since it gives the viewer a feel of what point in time this story took place. This also allows the viewer's attention to be solely drawn to the script of the film.\nAs Jake LaMotta, Robert DeNiro delivered a strong performance from beginning to end as we watch LaMotta's trajectory of self-destruction due to inner conflict, and extreme struggle when it comes to controlling his anger without reacting with either verbal or physical violance. His inability to control his temper, violent behavior and bad decisions leads to a tragic end of the 3 things he loves the most: his boxing career, his marriage and his relationship with his brother. His wife Vickie LaMotta is played by Cathy Moriarty and brother Joey by Joe Pesci could not have been better casting choices for these roles. For the most part, I would say that this movie centers mostly around LaMotta's turbulent relationship specially with his wife and his insecurities and need to control her every move. With the great acting skills portrayed and exceptional screenplay by writers Paul Schrader and Madik Martin, I was completely hooked from beginning to end. In multiple scenes, specially those where there is intense arguing and even domestic violence, the intensity between the characters can be felt. It is sad to see how this individual seems to be taking a lot of beatings in life regardless of how many boxing matches he wins.  \nAnother production highlight is the music and sounds. For example, when LaMotta is fighting in the ring, the crowd's energy can be felt. Also when he has a major fight with his wife and brother, the intensity of the moment with the sound of punches and all other surrounding sounds leaves an imprint with the viewers.\nOverall, I highly recommend this film. I personally specifically enjoy biographies and was hooked from beginning to end. An overall great production.",

This film is starring Robert De Niro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci, Frank Vincent, Nicholas Colasanto, and Theresa Saldana. Raging Bull is a dramatic film focusing on the life of boxer Jake La Motta. Jake La Motta was a boxing champion turned stand up comedian. Jakes life was troubled by domestic violence, greed, anger, jealousy, and lack of trust. In this film you watch Jake La Motta once promising boxer fall from grace, lose his wife and kids, go to Jail, and eventually try to pick up the pieces of his broken life. The film is very loud and dramatic. Robert De Niro plays Jake La Motta. He gives an excellent performance, he really sells the anger and emotions his character is feeling. Joe Pesci plays Joey, Jakes younger brother/manager. Joe Pesci gives a great performance in the supporting role and really works well with Robert De Niro. Joey and Jakes brotherly relationship adds a great dynamic to the film as we can all see the fractures starting between their relationship. Raging Bull focuses less on the boxing aspect of Jake La Motta's life than I would have liked to see. During the boxing scenes they didn't quite sell it for me. It would have been nice to have seen more technical boxing moves. On the transition to comedy it was done quite well. Robert De Niro really stood out when delivering those monologues. The Performances were compelling, and I can see how this movie really helped push Robert De Niro to excel in his acting career. Overall this was a decent film it had a lot of elements to make a great movie. I don't see myself ever watching it again but for those who are really into the dramas this film is right up their alley. In conclusion Raging Bull is a very powerful film that shines with the performances from the actors/actresses but for me falls short in some of the excitement and technical elements.",

            "content": "The movie Raging Bull by Martin Scorsese, featuring Robert De Niro, a masterpiece?  I don't get it, but respect the opinions of others.  From the beginning, it was a movie that was personally difficult to watch.  Perhaps one reason may be that I am not a boxing fan - not sure?  And, although the movie was in black and white, I did not care much for the blood spewing scenes.  As seen throughout the movie, De Niro, in his role as Jake La Motta, a middleweight boxer, took out his frustrations on his opponents to the nth degree where there were gory blood dripping scenes - not my cup of tea.  Given the demons of insecurity, jealousy, and superiority complex which possessed De Niro's character, Scorsese was able to convey that the main character had deep issues which stemmed from his own personal frustrations as to his professional boxing career aspirations.  Furthermore, his lack of respect and trust in others, including his wife, Vicky (played by Cathy Moriarty) and his brother (played by Joe Pesci) only made matters worse and complicated family interactions. Yet, Moriarty and Pesci, whom I connected with more than De Niro, did an awesome job convincing me that they on the other hand cared about De Niro's character.  \nA plus for me was character wardrobe, hair and makeup - reminiscent of the 1940's.  I did; however, have a hard time getting past De Niro's looks, especially his nose which appeared like a giant blob of silly putty in between his eyes. As this is a biographical of Jake La Motta, I looked him up and saw that despite my reservations, Scorsese nailed the look which closely resembled La Motta down to the nose.  I'm not sure about the voice, but it was difficult at times to make out what De Niro was saying.  Often times, muffled noises came out of his mouth which made me focus even more on the odd shaped nose.  I actually found that Cathy Moriarty closely resembled La Motta's wife in real life.  She was the one person I actually empathized with as she endured beatings and humiliations by De Niro's character as well as his brother Joey played by Pesci.  The two brothers, Jake and Joey, played by De Niro and Pesci, were equally rude and dismissive to females, up to and including showing displays of violence.  As such, this movie should be restricted to adults.  There is significant foul language throughout the movie.  I did not see this movie when it came out in 1980, as I was underage.  I am pretty confident that it is not something of interest today.  This said, as a movie on the top 100 greatest American movies, recommend seeing at least once for you may very well agree with the many others who consider it a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Raging bull is a sports drama directed by Martin Scorsese and produced by Irwin Winkler. The movie centers around Jake LaMotta who Robert De Nero portrayed exceptionally. The authenticity of this movie allows us to see the world from LaMottaï¿ 1/2(TM)s eyes. The movie demonstrates the life of a boxer in the 1940s and 50s. LaMotta doesnï¿ 1/2(TM)t express his emotions throughout the film, he is angry, paranoid, and extremely jealous. What happens within the ring isnï¿ 1/2(TM)t guided by any boxing tactics but by LaMotta's emotions, himself being his own worst enemy. His jealousness comes by his sexual insecurities, for example in his mind a woman like Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) is perfect for him until he sleeps with her. In his mind when Vickie does sleep with him he loses respect for her because he thinks that she would sleep with any other guy. Scorsese in some slow motion scenes shows us how LaMottaï¿ 1/2(TM)s jealousy is at a point that any interaction that Vickie has with any man makes him think she is cheating on him. He even thought that she cheated on him with his own brother. What makes this movie so unique is our best source of information about LaMotta doesn't come from his words expressing his emotions but from the way people around him perceived him. The black and white color scheme could be a barrier for us, the viewers, to get a clear understanding of LaMottaï¿ 1/2(TM)s mind, his life could be an amazing journey but through his eyes the world was colorless. The chemistry between LaMotta (De Nero) and his brother in the movie (Joe Pesci) is amazing, those two together shine. Within the ring the raging bull ï¿ 1/2LaMottaï¿ 1/2Â? seems like the only way he can release his downward spiral of emotions is by destroying opponents but in reality he could be imagining as fighting with himself. The atmosphere while he is fighting is filled with smoke and there is a lot of blood flying out of the opponents faces making it extremely realistic. I do recommend this movie because it comes with a very important message also I feel, if you make it big like LaMotta did never forget the people that supported you along the way.",

Raging Bull sheds a light on the intense, rageful, and strikingly masochistic behaviors in the interpersonal relationships of boxer Jake Lamotta. \nI found this film to be gripping in its intensity. I find it unfortunate that many scenes seen in the initial screenplay, written by Mardik Martin, were later taken out by Paul Schrader. I think that the addition of those scenes, which examined an intensely masochistic behavior, would've served the purpose of this film. I enjoyed very much the lack of a film score. I found that this lacking allowed for moments of rage, in throwing and hitting things, to possess a percussive quality. The lone striking sounds amplified intensity, which I found to be very pleasing. I found the screenplay to be well-thought and made with great intent. I also found the production and directing of this film to be extraordinary. It is evident that much thought went into each aspect of the film's production. I found the acting of each member to be gripping. The only instance in which I felt taken back by what I found to be a shyness in acting, is when Vicky, played by Cathy Moriarty, is beaten by Jake La Motta, played by Robert De Niro. I felt that my concentration was not committed in this moment, as a result of what I found to  be dispassionate acting. I enjoyed stylistic choices including the mixed use of color and black and white film, at the ratio which would've been common for that era. Overall, I enjoyed viewing this film and would recommend others to see it. My only wish is that, since it did go so far as to invite moments of masochistic behavior,  it would've been more fulfilling to see the additions in Mardik Martin's screenplay.",

What a film.  As a brief story description, I will go through the sequence of events from the beginning of the film to the end.  After losing his first fight to Jimmy Reeves, Jake is devastated from the defeated.  After coming home, he unviability takes it out on his wife who mistakenly did not cook his steak to his specifications.  It was obvious at this point that the mob will pay a role in this film.  A short time later, Jake meets a 15-year-old girl Vickie, and decides to date.  A few years pass by and Jake is back in the ring, only this time the mob boss, Tommy Como, hot on his trail wanted Jake to work for him.  This is followed by Jake getting jealous at a gentleman named Salvy for ï¿ 1/2flirtingï¿ 1/2Â? with Vickie.  This jealousy definitely stays throughout the film and can be attributed to Jakeï¿ 1/2(TM)s biggest win of his career at the time against Marcel Cerdan.  After this victory, Jake is the new world middleweight champion.  After the fight, him and his brother argue over the fact that he thinks Joey slept with Vickie.  Once Vicky somewhat confesses to her infidelity, Jake then beats her and Joey.  In Jakeï¿ 1/2(TM)s last fight with all too well-known Sugar Ray Robinson, whom he was beaten by in the beginning of the movie, was beat again.  Fresh into retirement, Vickie files for a deforce in light of catching Jake letting under aged girls dance at his night club.  She ultimately takes their kids, Jake becomes broke, and ends up in Jail.  The movie ends just as it began, with him rehearsing in the dressing room of a night club. \n\nProduction highlights (positive or negative):\n\nI thought the most gravitating moment came toward the end of the movie when Jake was selling jewels from his championship belt, then realizing they were not worth anything without the belt. \n\nOverall Recommendation:\n\nI would recommend if it was a movie night at the house.  It really pulls you in to pay attention and hope for the best for Jake until you realize what kind of man he becomes.  It is definitely an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nConclusion: \n\nIf I had one piece of advice for Jake it would be this, stay true to yourself and no girl is worth losing your life over.",

            "content": "Martin Scorseseâ(TM)s 1980 film âRaging Bullâ? tells the semi-biographical story of 1940â(TM)s Italian-American boxer Jake LaMotta. Robert De Niro, who faithfully depicts LaMotta, was initially inspired to make the film after reading the boxerâ(TM)s autobiography. Scorsese took a passive interest in the script, but continued to work on other films he deemed more pressing. However, upon Scorseseâ(TM)s hospitalization from heavy drug use, De Niro attempted one last time to convince his long time friend of the narrative he saw buried within LaMottaâ(TM)s life story. \n\nScorsese, now battling his own demons, finally realized the scale and gravity of De Niroâ(TM)s vision, and perhaps saw some similarities between his personal life and the tumultuous life of LaMotta as depicted in Madrik Martinâ(TM)s initial screenplay. Producers Robert Chartoff and Iwrin Winkler agreed to aid in the films production, continent upon Scorsese directing the film. Despite having shied away from sports his entire life, Scorsese began to see LaMottaâ(TM)s struggles in the ring as potential allegories for manâ(TM)s personal conflicts. Paul Schrader was eventually brought in to rewrite the script, after which De Niro and Scorsese continued to trim the final script while isolated on the island of Saint Martin. \n\nDespite being a boxing movie, many of the filmâ(TM)s most climactic moments happen outside of the ring. âRaging Bullâ? tells the story of a man driven mad by his own insecurity. In real life, LaMotta was given the nickname âThe Bronx Bullâ? due to his unrelenting fighting style which he used to overpower opponents. In the context of the film however, the term âRaging Bullâ? begins to represent LaMottaâ(TM)s self-destructive behavior as a result of his inability to trust those around him. Like many of Scorseseâ(TM)s films, much of the dialogue stems from the male protagonistâ(TM)s inability to trust women. However, in âRaging Bullâ? this theme transforms from a trope to the main source of conflict within the film. LaMottaâ(TM)s destructive actions are almost entirely spurred on by his self-actualizing fantasy that his wife, Vickie, is cheating on him. As the plot unfolds, LaMotta convinces himself that his wife has been unfaithful, allowing his accusations alone to serve as proof. De Niroâ(TM)s method acting benefits the script tremendously, allowing the viewer to peak inside the mind of someone wholly consumed by their owned fears. \n\nLamottaâ(TM)s wife Vickie is portrayed by Cathy Moriarty, who, despite being only 19 at the time of filming, flawlessly portrays a woman stuck in a terrible marriage. Early in the film, Vickie serves as a manifestation of LaMottaâ(TM)s sexual desire. As the film progresses however, this desire transforms into compulsive obsession. De Niroâ(TM)s character continually projects his shallow vision of women unto his wife Vickie, who stands tall in spite of this and refuses to indulge her husbandâ(TM)s inferiority. \n\nJoe Pesci serves as the main supporting actor, depicting Jakeâ(TM)s older brother Joey. The many scenes of dialogue between Joey and Jake help reinforce the feeling of paranoia that begins to overtake the film. Pesci contributes tremendously by offsetting Jakeâ(TM)s headstrong attitude with rational and heartfelt counterpoints. Despite this, Pesciâ(TM)s character eventually cracks under the weight of his brotherâ(TM)s insecurity, marking the end of Lamottaâ(TM)s last genuine relationship in the film.\n\nâRaging Bullâ? was edited by Thelma Schoonmaker, who won an Oscar for her work on the film. In my opinion, some of the movieâ(TM)s most impressive moments can be attributed to Schoonmakerâ(TM)s editing. The boxing scenes in particular are claustrophobic and brutally violent, and Schoonmakerâ(TM)s technical editing style makes other boxing films of the time look mild. In particular, the almost stop-motion depiction of Lamottaâ(TM)s knock out of Sugar Ray presents a stark visual contrast between Lamottaâ(TM)s boxing and personal life. This effect is further aided by Frank Warner, whose sound design during fights scenes utilized various animal screeches to emphasize the brutish and raw nature of Lamottaâ(TM)s fighting style. Additionally, Schoonmaker often deploys a slight slow-motion effect. At the beginning of the film, this slow motion effect serves as a visual representation of Jakeâ(TM)s fetishization of Vickie as a âpureâ? women. However, in the latter half of the film, the slow-mo conveys a sense of heightened paranoia, especially during Lamottaâ(TM)s abusive outbursts towards Vickie. \n\nBoth the beginning and the end of the film show a middle aged La Motta, now pacing through life aimlessly after pushing away his loved ones. The boxerâ(TM)s fighting style within the ring echo his self-destructive way of thinking, but the physical damage he endures as a boxer pale in comparison to the mental trauma he forces himself to endure. Scorseseâ(TM)s masterpiece feels almost like a documentary, in part, I believe, because the story resonated so deeply with the director during his low point. Raging Bull is not an easy film to watch. Scorceseâ(TM)s depictions of domestic abuse and the more subtle signs of a toxic relationship will undoubtedly unsettle many viewers. However, it stands to this day as possibly the most accurate depiction of manâ(TM)s crippling insecurity and the self-destructive habits that can stem from that insecurity.",

            "content": "Raging Bull is classical masterpiece that was directed by Martin Scorsese that delves into complex ideas and thematic elements. The film can be taken as a boxing film on the surface, but looking at it further reveals that it is more than just that. It tries to focus on the personal conflict that befalls the main character as he comes to terms with himself. The characterisation of the lead shows an individual that is struggling to overcome elements of sexual insecurities. This drives him to go into boxing to allow himself to tackle this issues, but they eventually bring him down to the ground at the end. \n\tA defining element of this film is the cinematography which manages to show the brutal world of boxing down to its core. The fights that are present in the film feature a number of shots which are close-up to show the intensity of the fight and to deliver the raw emotions of what is happening on the screen. Ideally, the editing of the film allowed the audience to be a part of the action by being present in the ring as the fights happen. This worked well with fluid movement of the camera to capture different takes of the action. The score used in the film further enhances the raw action of boxing by adding to the impact of the boxing blows through thudding noises. This film is able to show how jealousy can drive a man to the extremes. The main character is unable to control his low self-esteem and this makes him prefer physical pain rather than confront the issues affecting him. As a result, the audience sees a man who is at his wits end. \n\tAnother interesting idea that is present in this film is how visual elements of the film have been brought out. The director uses slow motion to invoke a specific feeling of intensity to the viewer. The purpose of this is to bring out the intricate motion of the characters to show their behaviour and actions. Therefore, the audience gets to be an active element in the events that are happening on the screen.",

            "content": "Raging Bull is a film that really captivates Jake Lamottaï¿ 1/2(TM)s inability to understand the reality of situations and his anger and insecurities within himself. Jake Lamotta is played by Robert DiNero, who really became Lamotta throughout. He expressed his anger, his disbelief, and his stubbornness. This film takes us on a journey of Lamotta throughout his boxing career, though this film does not focus on being a boxing movie. Lamotta meets a woman, Vicky, and eventually makes her his wife. Heï¿ 1/2(TM)s insecure that his wife has been unfaithful, and is lying to him. Everyone is lying to Lamotta. He keeps spiraling with his relationships with others due to his anger and insecurities within himself. Eventually, Lamotta canï¿ 1/2(TM)t control himself and he tanks a big moment in his life. This film teaches how insecurities and tempers can impact oneï¿ 1/2(TM)s life. Director Martin Scorsese and producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff make this film realistic and unromanticized about the actual life of Jake Lamotta. The actual screen play was based on Lamottaï¿ 1/2(TM)s actual autobiography, and adapted by Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin. \nOverall, this film is not full of action and intense suspense in the storyline. Instead, it follows the life of Lamotta. This gives the audience a genuine appreciation for Lamottaï¿ 1/2(TM)s internal struggles and the impact actions like this could have on surrounding people. The film was shot in black and white, which makes the audience truly focus on the characters instead of the surroundings and colors that could be within the film. The cinematography and overall visual effects were well done for the year in which this was produced. Overall, the story can be a bit mundane and dull since there is so little action. This film really focuses on inner conflicts, rather than external and man to man conflicts that most films that are really intense seem to do. This film was very well done in the sense of telling a story, the internal conflicts within this manï¿ 1/2(TM)s life, and was beautifully done visually in black and white. However, it is understandable that some audiences may think this film doesnï¿ 1/2(TM)t spark much interest due to the lack of embellished storylines. This film shows that cinema can be more than just crazy storylines with a lot of external and man to man conflict. This film shows that cinema can be about real people and stories and that not everything has to be romanticized for the audienceï¿ 1/2(TM)s liking.",

            "content": "The Raging Bull Movie Review\n\nThe Raging Bull directed by Martin Scorsese and produced by Irwin Winkler, is said to be one of the best movies of the 1980ï¿ 1/2(TM)s; a true masterpiece. It centers in on violent and relentless boxing champion Jake Lamotta, who is played by Robert Di Nero. This movie also featured a lot of well-known actors. Cathy Moriartyï¿ 1/2(TM)s character Vicki (Jakeï¿ 1/2(TM)s wife) was nominated for an Oscar as well as Joe Pesci who played Jakeï¿ 1/2(TM)s brother. The screenplay written by Paul Schrader, succeeded in portraying the main character, Jake, who was completely unable to express his feelings to himself or others. This drives him to the point of completely losing himself. In the film, Jakeï¿ 1/2(TM)s aggression and abuse ends up hurting his loved ones, which makes me think this movie is about a lot more than just boxing, but what self-destruction, depression and uncontrollable anger can do to someone. It seems like he just couldnï¿ 1/2(TM)t keep his violence in the ring. His rage and lack of self- control turns into an uncontrollable violence in a specific scene, where he is fighting one of his opponents his wife described as ï¿ 1/2good looking.ï¿ 1/2Â? His jealousy drives him to brutally beat this man and once he is done, he stares directly into the crowd at his wife as if he is sending her a message. He is sort of a sick man. Ultimately, this movie is about a manï¿ 1/2(TM)s inner conflict and struggle with himself and how that downward spiral takes a toll on himself and his loved ones. \n\nWith all of the blood and violence, you would think it would be less intense when shot in black and white cinematography, but it is still just as brilliant. In one of the scenes, blood squirts out of Lamotta and all over the crowd.  This is definitely not a movie for kids and certainly makes Rocky look like a saint. Some production highlights that worked for me was Scorseseï¿ 1/2(TM)s use of slow motion frames. He did this when he wanted the audience to feel the tension behind Lamottaï¿ 1/2(TM)s gaze. He uses this mostly when Jake is staring at Vicky, to show the audience how bad he is struggling internally and his deep hatred for her. His speculations of her cheating consume him and the only way he knows how to deal with this anger is to take it out on her or his opponents in the ring. I believe this film portrays jealousy and fear in the best way. Lamottaï¿ 1/2(TM)s insecurity and pain was so strong that he did not feel pain of physical punches. In my opinion, some of the most powerful scenes that gave light to the theme and central idea of this film were the scenes where we watched him getting attacked with punches and still stand his ground. He rarely ever fell down.  Although he was broken inside, he stood his ground in the ring and never let anyone take him down. Ironically, he was taking himself down without even knowing it. Overall, if you enjoy bloody movies about the effects of self-destruction, immense agony and jealousy, then this movie is for you!",

            "content": "Jeff Barnes \n12/7/17 \n\n\nRaging Bull Review \n\tRaging Bull's filmmaking is brilliant, enabling you to authentically experience how boxer Jake Lamotta's life felt. The script brings depth to the story by giving the characters emotion and personality. It brings you a story that enables you to really see the world through Jake Lamotta's eyes. Jake Lamotta's world is filled with many feelings including: deception, confusion, gloom, emotion, plenty of violence, plenty of rage, and a sufficient amount of anger. \nThere's even some sexiness added to the script. The cinematography handles the black and white, camera movements, and point of view shots, in a genuinely significant manner. There's a brilliant shaky cam experience after Jake Lamotta knocks Sugar Ray Robinson down during one of their fights together. There are also memorable still shots of some of Jake Lamotta's fights. The cinematography especially stands out when we literally see the world through Jake Lamotta's eyes when he fights Sugar Ray Robinson for the last time, and he's getting the beating of a lifetime from Sugar Ray Robinson. The acting brings melodrama to Jake Lamotta's authentically emotional life, and also there's immense method acting from Robert Deniro. There are very few flaws with the script and with the film as a whole. \n\tRaging Bull's filmmaking is brilliant enabling you to authentically experience Jake Lamotta's life through: script, cinematography, and acting. \n\tThe script of Raging Bull gives depth to the story by creating characters that have emotion and personality. Jake Lamotta is a man who has more flaws than strengths. In fact he has so many flaws that it makes us think what positivity comes out of him. Lamotta does things that most people wouldn't dream of doing such as: beating his wife, getting involved with an under aged girl, sexually assaulting a man's wife. So what's positive about Jake Lamotta? There's plenty of positivity that comes to Jake Lamotta's negativity with the fact that it has loads of intrigue to it because he's faulty in shocking ways, because he gets involved with an under aged girl and sexually assaults a woman in front of her husband, yet he's also faulty in ways that aren't shocking because he's also deficient in ways that plenty of people are deficient. Lamotta ends up beating his wife Vicki when he suspects her of being unfaithful to him, and he beats his brother Joey when he speculates that Vicki is being unfaithful to him with his brother.  The certainty that Jake Lamotta committed assault and battery reminds us of our, younger selves, because like Jake we didn't have enough sense to really manage to control anger. Jake Lamotta, however, is a grown man who committed assault and battery, so he should know better. He also hits a woman something so immoral that few men do it. \n\tLamotta not only introduces a 14-year-old girl to other men and goes to jail for it but he kisses the 14 year old with his with his tongue. He also forcibly kisses a woman in front of her husband. There probably have been people who have kissed other people without their permission when they were younger, because there was a boy on the news whom I had heard done it and even I did it when I was younger but it was probably because I, or a lot of people didn't have enough sense back then to know it's sexual harassment. I'm not even sure if most people kiss women in front of their husbands because I've never heard anything about it on the news or have seen it in real life. The only people who absolutely can relate to Lamotta forcibly kissing a lady is the people who have displayed sexual misconduct, such as: Harvey Weinstein, Al Franken, and even our own president Donald Trump.\n\tJake is being oversensitive such as when he sees a man give his wife Vicki a quick kiss on the mouth. He also is genuinely pessimistic in the way that he fears that he will lose his fight to Tony Janiro because he's too overweight. \n\tLamotta's older brother Joey serves not just as his best friend but also as his mentor and his manager. Joey is a version of Jake that happens to be more knowledgeable but also is secretive filled with: deception, confusion, and suspicion. There's a moment in the picture where he comes off as a bit of a hypocrite when he tells him to live a little by telling him to eat like there's no tomorrow yet later on in the scene he tells him he's killing himself with the way he eats. There's a feeling of treachery and suspicion when Joey doesn't give Jake all the details of a run in he got into with his friend Salvy. \n\tJake Lamotta's wife Vicki is a character that fills Jake Lamotta's life with delight and also with treachery, and puzzlement. She endows him with delight in an exhibition in the picture that is authentically sexy with genuinely sexy dialogue when she takes off Jake's pants when he tells her too, and also takes off her panties when he tells her too. She endows Jake with deceitfulness when he sees her allow two men two kiss her on the mouth. She brings disorientation to Jake's life when he asks his brother Joey if he had intercourse with her and he doesn't answer the question, and then he asks Vicki the same question and she says \"no\" therefore, Jake is living in a world where he doesn't know who to trust. \n\tLamotta is a character you feel sorry for even though he's so flawed because he doesn't have a tremendously successful boxing career, and this echoes Rocky Balboa in Rocky not being a well known boxer and being an underdog before he fights Apollo Creed in Rocky, however one could argue that Jake Lamotta's boxing career wasn't as unsuccessful as it was thought to be. There is a moment where the public believes that the judges robbed Jake in regards to his fight with Jimmy Reeves, and also a moment in the film when Jake's brother Joey believes he was robbed in one of his fights concerning Sugar Ray Robinson, and Raging Bull reiterates Rocky 2 here because in Rocky 2 the public believes that Rocky was swindled out of his first fight with Apollo Creed in the first Rocky. He is also living in a world where he doesn't know who or what to believe because he hears so much gossip. \n\tThe cinematography in Raging Bull has fairly notable moments with: the camera movements, point of view shots, and black and white as well as color photography. The best radiant camera movements in the film are when Lamotta punches Robinson in the ring and the camera spins around the ring, and also when Lamotta knocks Robinson down and there's a shaky cam mixed in with a close up experience as Robinson is down in the ring. There's also an occasion where after Joey and Vicki have a quick kiss on the mouth, and we see Vicki walk up the stairs and the camera makes a slow pan towards the room Jake and Joey are in, and the camera does this in preparation for an occasion for Jake confronting Joey.  \n\tThe best point of view shot is when we see Sugar Ray Robinson's face from Jake LaMotte's perspective. We see Robinson have a fierce and ferocious look on his face before he gives Lamotta the whipping of a lifetime. \n\tThe picture not only does well with the use of black and white, which is appropriate for the picture since we don't want to be distracted by too much color in a very serious film with an abundance of gloom and anger, but also with a brief use of color.  \nThe black in the film is not overused or underused in certainty there's a moment in the film where the black is used in a very vivid manner with being made as black as ink when Sugar Ray Robinson punches Jake Lamotta so hard that blood squirts on the announcers faces during Jake Lamotta's final fight with Sugar Ray Robinson. The white in the picture is not overused or underused with the certainty with it's even a little bit grayish such as at the beginning of the film where Jake Lamotta is boxing in a ring full of gray fog.  \n\tColor is vividly used with black and white. Red introduces the title of the film when Lamotta is in the ring contrasting with the black and white. Color is used during a montage that's full of happiness when we see Jake marrying Vicki and dancing with Vicki around a pool. Raging Bull gives a fair amount of nod to another film about a boxer turned longshoreman called On the Waterfront with its cinematography by being shot in black and white like On the Waterfront. It also gives praise to it by having a blonde bombshell as the female lead. It gives honor to On the Waterfront when Jake Lamotta at the end of the film quotes the famous \"I could have been a contender\" speech Terry gives to his brother in the back of the taxicab in the film.   \n\tThe acting in Raging Bull is filled with an abundance of melodrama, for a film not only based on a man's sentimental life but also a sentimental book on his life. Joe Pesci as Joey makes you feel a maximum of fury when he hits a chair on stacks, and when he hits the character Salvy with a car door. Robert Deniro really transforms into Jake Lamotta by making you feel an abundance of emotion for him when he beats his wife and brother because he can't ever be sure if he found truth in the world that he lives in. Robert Deniro makes us really feel Jake Lamotta's pain when he has a meltdown when he's in jail, and he's sobbing because there's so much gloom to his essence. \n\tThere are genuinely few mistakes with the picture Raging Bull. There's a bit in the film that seems unnecessary or to have no point to it. There's a scene in the film where Lamotta pours ice and water on himself and he seems to be masturbating after he does it my guess as to why he did this is to relieve stress before his next fight. There's also a bit in the film that looks fishy when we see Lamotta kissing his wife Vicki in front of kids when she's on the floor and it looks as if he's about to make love in front of his kids. Raging Bull is a tad bit too unoriginal with the authenticity with that it's not only based on a man's life but a book on a man's life as well.\n\tRaging Bull really stands out with all of its production most notably with: its script, its cinematography, and its acting. I give Raging Bull a 10 and an A.",

            "content": "Widley regarded as Martin Scorsese's magnum opus and one of the best sporting biopics of all time, Raging Bull features a career-best performance from Robert De Niro, going full method as well as full insane. I'm a big boxing fan, and as such it was exciting to witness the famous fight sequences, filled in gory closeups to emphasise all the face twisting, blood-spattered mayhem. I don't know if it was something to do with the fighters back then, or maybe the rules that were in force at the time, but none of the fighters seem interested in raising their hands to defend themselves. Also, some of them take ferocious beatings up against the ropes with no discernible ability to defend themselves, and yet the Refs rarely step in to stop the fight. Finally, despite Scorsese and De Niro aiming for realism and authenticity, La Motta pummels the Hell out of his opponents, and gets pummelled in return, yet after the fight they display very few physical injuries, aside from the infamous St Valentines Day Massacre bout. Also, it doesn't have any characters to root for. Jake La Motta is a jealous, abusive brute, Joey La Motta isn't much better. Almost everyone else is a crook apart from Vickie. She's the closest one to a likable character, but she ends up being so passive that she rarely has an active part in the story. Scorsese has made a living directing movies with unlikable leads, but unlike Travis Bickle or Bill Cutting, I didn't end up feel anything for La Motta. The dialogue consists mostly of him asking 'What's that all about?', or 'Who you been talking too?' or some variant of the 2, and the film drags badly towards the end. The acting is great, especially from De Niro, and it's brutally realistic, but I just didn't care much for it. I've enjoyed several of Scorsese's pictures, but despite the obvious talent on display, Raging Bull just didn't connect with me like some of the others did.",

To start things off Robert De Niro does a superb job and was amazing in the film, Joe Pesci is fantastic in this film too and so did Cathy Moriarty. Jake LaMotta is a complex character, he has a lot of flaws and the movie does not shy away from that. He takes things the wrong way almost all of the time and he gets angry a lot because of it hence the title. Unlike Rocky this is not really a movie about inspiring someone, this movie is a look behind the curtain on a boxer who has a lot of problems. The little things like the the title in the beginning being red symbolizing rage and anger don't get enough credit. The scenes where Jake is slapping Vicky because he took something that happened the wrong way or when Joey was reaching his breaking point because he is getting sick of Jake are my favorite scenes in the movie because it shows a good look into reality and are emotional. He may have been a prizefighter in the ring but in real life he is not. The movie presents it's real fights outside the ring, the fights that break Jake down as a person and that's what I love about this movie. And when I think back at this movie I don't think about the boxing I think about everything outside of it but that's not to say the boxing in this movie is good because it sure is, boxing is just a way to release is anger and it is not really a central part of the movie. Overall it is a very well edited, raw, great movie with fantastic performances and this is a must watch for movie fans",

The person he portrayed was despicable, an animal, but it was done so well and so realistically, you gotta applaud him.\n\nThe flow of the story was just fine, biographical, going from point to point, it's the nature of biopics. It wasn't bad, but there's nothing else to say about it.\n\nJoe Pesci did a great job as Jake's brother. Always love seeing this sharp little actor work his magic, even if a lot of his characters feel a little bit the same.\n\nThe music was beautiful, the black and white visuals worked well enough for me, the makeup was insanely good (Robert's looks from the beginning to the end of this movie were incredibly well done), a lot of great moody shots in this movie, and the casting was mostly really well done. The exception being the actress who played Vickie, whose character at the beginning of the movie was supposedly 15 years old. Looked way older.

            "content": "A masterpiece that is a superlative in terms of acting, editing, and the entire sports genre, Raging Bull represents a torrent of raw, violent masculinity under attack. One could put forth many points that this is Scorsese's magnum opus, and they wouldn't be wrong. You even could say that this film saved his career and life in the early 80s as he was recovering from coke addiction.\n\nIt tells the story of how boxer Jake La Motta nearly destroyed his life due to out of control anger issues and persistent sexual jealousy toward his wife. De Niro delivers the performance of his life (the massive weight gain is just a tiny part of it) and with Pesci to back him up, I can confidently say that no other film matches this one in terms of acting. Cathy Moriarty is also great as La Motta's victimized wife, and Frank Vincent's turn as Salvy foresees something about a shinebox. We can sympathize with Jake despite his rage and disgusting appetite, with his insecurities and frustration, with the mafia keeping the title out of his hand, while also seeing him for the repellent jerk he is.\n\nRaging Bull is an editor's wet dream. It honestly might be the best edited film I've ever seen. The way the picture flows together seamlessly, making smart use of cuts or doing without them, adds to the technical marvel. Thelma Schoonmaker won a well deserved Oscar for her technique. The movie contains one of the greatest tracking shots of all time, in the championship title scene, as it follows La Motta from his dressing room all the way to the ring. This combined with a beautiful musical piece by composer Pietro Mascagni makes for raw emotion on steroids, and I'm not ashamed to say it made me weep. The cinematography of this film is a sight to behold thanks to Michael Chapman, who also shot Taxi Driver, and the black and white lens gives it a strange melancholy beauty.\n\nSince redemption is a key feature of Scorsese's pictures we get an ambiguous ending here about the nature of Jake's rebirth. As he quotes Brando's famous speech from On the Waterfront, we wonder if he really does see the problems he caused or simply looking for someone else to blame.\n\nWhile the film is bleak, it also has a tendency to be very funny at times. The dynamic and countless dialogue exchanges between De Niro and Pesci are comedy gold. I always burst out laughing at the scene where Jake loses his shit over a burnt steak, and again when he gets Joey to punch him in the face over and over again. And no other film could pull off a hilarious line like \"your mother sucks fucking big fucking elephant dick\" so well.\n\nSo in other words Raging Bull is a masterpiece and one that should be seen by everyone and seen again. A man that dies without seeing this film is not a man at all.",

            "content": "Raging Bull is notable because it does something I’ve rarely seen in any other film. It is a biopic that takes an entirely unfiltered and unbiased look at events in the life of Jake La Motta, trying to emulate a documentary. And by doing this it sucks all emotion from the experience. I watched without caring, and didn’t even know if I was supposed to care about anything in the movie. There is not much flow or narrative structure, instead it plays out like you’re watching a series of home movies. But not ones documenting the highlights and exciting events of life, these home movies show the depressing and awful moments. It’s hard to express how much I felt like Scorsese was intentionally keeping me away from connecting with all that is unfolding. Despite my best efforts to enjoy the experience, he kept me at arm’s length and demanded that I just watch and see what happens instead of getting emotionally involved. A big part of that feeling of distance probably comes from the fact that I could find no audience surrogate in the film. There aren’t characters that I could identify with and use as my window into the film. The main character is a broken man, who behaves in a despicable fashion the entire time. It’s easy to hate Jake La Motta, and I guess that is to Robert De Niro’s credit, because I get the impression he was an unpleasant man. Joe Pesci’s role as the brother is the closest Raging Bull comes to offering an opportunity for the audience to sympathize with someone in the story. However, he has such an abrasive personality, and doesn’t add much nuance to make his character likeable. Also, while I’m talking about the cast, in what world does Cathy Moriarty look at all like a teenager? I understand that among La Motta’s many flaws was his penchant for underage women, so why not cast someone who actually looks under 30? The boxing in Raging Bull might be some of the least convincing I’ve seen in a major motion picture. It rarely feels like the punches are connecting, or that any of these actors actually belong in a boxing ring. Also, there simply isn’t enough boxing to make that a central thrust of the film. It’s a non-stop string of things outside the ring that happened to this unpleasant person who happens to be a boxer. There’s nothing to look forward to, there’s no drama waiting to see what will come next, instead it’s like sitting through a slide show of depressing proportions. The words that instantly come to mind when I reflect on Raging Bull are things like “flat,” “bleak,” and “monotonous.” I’m willing to admit that the nearly perfect way that it repels me is a sign that something powerful is happening with the film, and therefore there must be logic to the fact that others revere it. I’m just delighted that I never have to watch it again.",

This is my first time viewing what many consider to be Martin Scorsese's masterpiece and, whilst I thought it was indeed very good, I can't say it moved me in quite the way many describe. The performances are undoubtedly excellent - both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci do some of their best work here without a doubt. The direction from Scorsese, particularly in the boxing scenes, is also a total knockout (sorry...). The idea of a man so insecure with himself that boxing becomes almost a form of self-punishment - merely to try and prove to people that he should be respected - is definitely a compelling plot line. The truth is, this is just one of those movies that I didn't connect with as much as I would've liked. I always felt distanced from what was happening on screen, and rarely did the emotional scenes have me feeling emotional. I found the character of Jake LaMotta, much like Travis Bickle in 'Taxi Driver', hard to empathise with. On paper, everything is there, and the movie is most certainly good. But this is just one of those instances where film, being totally subjective, will appeal to some and not to others. And whilst I certainly admire 'Raging Bull', I can't say I was flawed by it.",

That if you're a disrespectful asshole who abuses and objectifies women then no one will like you? I feel that message is self explanatory. Jake is so fantastically unlikable and unsympathetic that I feel no reason to care about anything that happens to him. Raging Bull feels hollow despite its world class artistry.",

Often referred as a classic by the critics, this gritty drama signifies the director Martin Scorsese's genius on filmmaking and his power on the pop culture world. Calling this film or particularly the character dark, wouldn't be enough. The range or the scale that it grasps in that department effortlessly is what's scary. And that is what the film does for the most part of its time. Surprisingly not in the ring against his opponents but in the house with his family.\n\nThe fights are just setting up the state of mind, just preparing him for the actual fight that he is going to start so effervescently back in real life. And it is an ugly, ugly game that they fight for. It is not everyone's cup of tea. I might be one of them. I admire the rich visual storytelling gift that Scorsese has. Just take the way he plants the premise of the plot in your head. The love track of Jake (Robert De Niro) and Vicky La Motta (Cathy Moriarty).\n\nNow, it is based on an outrageously wrong theme, but we aren't told to go there at all throughout the course of the film. And then when it comes for devil's due, every single wrong deed haunts him back. Which is cathartic for the people loving this genre. While me. I am tired of seeing some con artist or a morally bad person excelling in his or her field only to collapse with his or her built empire. By the way, that sums up half of Scorsese's filmography. Maybe that's why I never connected emotionally with Raging Bull or any of his films, it's not that it is bad, it is exceptional filmmaking, but it's definitely not for me.",

This I believe is because he is the best at seeing the humanity in the most flawed and violent people and of course it makes sense, considering Scorsese as a kid knew all the gangsters and the big shots as people first before he even knew they were killers. Once again in Raging Bull, Scorsese introduces us to a man with seminally no redeeming qualities. He is violent, explosive and full of rage, but why is he so angry. Like in all of Scorsese's greatest films his main characters male bravado conceals deep insecurity. He uses his anger as a tool in the only place he knows how, in the boxing ring where he has great success. He then meets Vickie and he is torn between two desires. He loves her in his own way but he treats her like and object fighting off gangsters and pretenders for his prize even if there not really there. What Jake can't understand is life and love isn't like the ring, attack is not the best form of defence and unlike the belt around his waist once the contenders are beaten nobody will stick around for the celebrations. In the end just like an animal he could not change his nature. This a masterpiece of a man's jealously, paranoia and ultimate self destruction.",

The movie also explores many of the complex issues of violence against women and the psychological destruction of a man who cannot accept or understand intimacy. The real magic is that these issues are expressed through the warped psychological outbursts of De Niro's character. Everyone around LaMotto can see his problem, his unhealthy obsession and suspicion but he cannot help himself. The film finds its expression through the emotional immaturity of the lead character.\n\nLaMotto cannot introspectively evaluate his emotions. His thought process is endlessly fascinating to watch as he warps any act of kindness or love into betrayal and distance. He lacks the emotional maturity or awareness to communicate his frustrations to words. The audience simply watches as any small act or suspicion is a window for him to confirm what he wants most of all, confirmation that his partner is unfaithful and by extension he is, himself, unworthy. His hate is a profound one, not a hate of others or what he attacks, but a hatred of himself. Everyone around him senses it but LaMotto simply cannot.\n\nThe film delivers the signature eye for detail that made Scorsese famous. The boxing fight scenes are brilliant and brutal.

            "content": "This is a great film on a number of levels - as a biography of former middleweight boxing champion Jake La Motta, yes, but also a fascinating character study, with stellar performances from Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, and epic direction from Martin Scorsese.  \n\nThe opening sequence sets the stage for something special; De Niro is dancing in place alone in the ring in poetic slow motion, we see the film will be in black and white and there is a smoky haze in the background as the opening credits roll.   We will soon see just how crazy this man is, as he turns over the dining table in a fight with his first wife over how long to cook his steak, yells down at his complaining neighbor that he's going to kill and eat his dog, and then goads his younger brother (Pesci) into punching him in the face as hard as he can.  Throughout the movie, the dialog between De Niro and Pesci is loud, confrontational, argumentative, and fantastic.  \n\nThe times were certainly different, and La Motta was part blunt New Yorker and part Cro-Magnon.  He makes out with his wife on the floor in front of his sister-in-law and their toddlers.  He's insanely jealous, and accuses his brother of having had sex with his wife (lines I will never forget, and sometimes quote: \"I heard things Joey, I heard things\" ... \"What things you heard?\" ... \"I heard some things\").  After confronting his wife, she \"confesses\" out of frustration, so he marches over to his brother's house and beats him up, also punching his wife in the face in the process, all in front of his brother's stunned kids.  \n\nLa Motta met his second wife Vikki when she was just 15, and married her when she was 16.  In the film she's played well by Cathy Moriarty, though she seems much older (she was only 20 at the time though).  In another unforgettable scene, this one erotically charged, she kisses his body when he's not allowed to have sex before a fight, and then after he goes to the sink to pour ice water down his shorts to cool off, shows up in the mirror and begins kissing him some more.  Scorsese uses a perfect amount of restraint here, however, and we never 'see' anything.   \n\nUnfortunately, he doesn't apply this same restraint to violence in the right, overstating it considerably, even considering the type of fighter La Motta was.  We see blood spraying as if it were out of a hose, and boxers enduring more punishment than humanly possible.   Maybe this is how Scorsese the man saw boxing, having not been a fan beforehand, or Scorsese the artist preferred to paint the violence of the men involved in the sport.  Regardless, it was not necessary.  That said, seeing De Niro at the end of the last bout with Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes), his face a meatloaf, eyes puffed over but grinning like a ghoul as he tottered over to Sugar Ray, taunting him despite the beating he just took, saying \"ya never got me down Ray\", is another memorable moment.\n\nCut to 6 years later, a fat La Motta is poolside in Florida smoking a cigar, having retired.  The legend is that De Niro gained 60-70 pounds over 4 months by eating high-end food in France and Italy, and it's just another larger-than-life aspect of this movie.  It's painful to watch his awkward stand-up act, his crude jokes, his philandering with women in the bar, and getting thrown into jail for having let young teenagers into his bar (they having 'proved' being of legal age by French kissing him).  His beer belly hangs out of his shirt while he's in a pay phone.  Like an idiot, he hammers the jewels out of his championship belt, looking to pawn them, and not understanding they're worth far more in the belt.  He's estranged from his brother, and the scene with De Niro following Pesci out of a convenience store down the street is heart wrenching.\n\nThe film ends with De Niro quoting Brando in 'On the Waterfront' as he practices his stand-up act in front of a mirror.  He does it with just the right amount of poor delivery (he's acting as La Motta after all) and pathos, it's another great scene, but I have to say, the words themselves ring false - La Motta's brother WAS looking out for him, among other things beating the hell out of some guys in a nightclub when they were getting too close to his wife, and La Motta did NOT end up with a one-way ticket to Palookaville after throwing a fight for the mafia, he ended up with a title fight a couple of years later and won it.  \n\nScorsese may have included too much violence, but he does so many other brilliant things.   Black and white was an excellent choice.  He uses slow motion to create an epic feel to moments.  He uses stills of some of the boxing victories, and footage altered to appear as if it's from old home movies to show events in some of the intervening years.    He tells the story with brutal honesty.   Most of all, he gives outstanding actors freedom, and they really delivered.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese has made an art-filled portrayal of a man that many would call an animal. Raging Bull was a film project that Robert Deniro wanted to do after he watched Jake LaMotta's autobiography and read the book the film was based on. It was thanks to Deniro that saved Scorsese's life from his troubled phase when he saw something in common between LaMotta and his life around the time making the film.\n\nRobert Deniro was phenomenal as Jake LaMotta, breathing new life to a character in ways that made his performance really astonishing back then. He got in shape to play a boxer and then put on a hulking amount of weight to play his has-been alter-ego in the later part. I really like how Deniro acts against Joe Pesci as his brother, who by the way, was Pesci's major film role that got him public recognition around the time when he was thinking of quitting on his acting career. Most of my favourite scenes are with Deniro and Pesci in the picture playing off as brothers.\n\nPaul Schrader who wrote Taxi Driver gave the same raw, insightful treatment to the film as he did for Taxi driver. The screenplay was relentless, yet enticing to see in motion picture. His work had fleshed out the main character in ways that makes him real or at best interesting.\n\nThere are many problems with Jake LaMotta himself as a human being. He is angry, mean, ugly, judgmental, paranoid and violent worst of all. He has the rough aspect of being human such as perseverance and physicality. Jake LaMotta possesses no real redeeming qualities that would consider him a decent person in the eye of society. He even asked his ex-wife if he was that bad in real life after watching this film. She told him that he was worse.\n\nI love the black and white cinematography for Raging Bull that gives it the mid-century. It also makes the film look more timeless, aging much better than if it was in colour. During the montage sequence that does feature colour, it is a cleaver form of storytelling without words that glamourizes LaMotta's life. How they film the boxing scenes were mesmerizing as far as how brutal and hyperbolic it appears. There are parts like the face of a boxer is bursting open with blood or how much smoke is brewing around them like they are descending to hell.\n\nNow I hate it when people come into these films having fixed expectations and end up hating it. Raging Bull is not all about boxing since it is only a backdrop. It revolves around the character study of a man retaining an abusive lifestyle and paranoid oversights during his prime. And whatever I said earlier about Jake LaMotta was referring to him, not the actor playing him. Raging Bull is a masterpiece that easily stands out among others in that decade and is definitely on my top 3 best films by Scorsese.",

Right from scene one wherein De Niro starts his monologue preparing for the script for the comedy stand till the very last scene, again a monologue from the famous film \"On the Waterfront\". The movie makes you wonder and spare a thought about a man who had achieved so much and yet fell to such a level wherein he would long forget the past glory he had achieved. I've seen a lot of films of De Niro but this one is certainly is the best. Some of the scenes like the one in jail where he hits the wall and sobs saying that \"Im not an animal, Im not that bad\" is superb or the scene where he suspects his brother having an affair with Vicky. Scorsese's technique of camera work and light along with the Black and White charm adds more importance to the film and its set up. Its hard to digest that the film was not accepted as a Best Picture contender by Academy, but rest assured everyone knows what this film is. As someone said, \"great work dont need labels, awards or honour, they need the vision to foresee what makes it great\".",

Take for instance the scene where he is pestering his brother played by Joe Pesci about the relationship between his wife and the brother.

Scorsese, Deniro and Pesci are absolutely incredible in this movie.

            "content": "Boxing legend Jake La Motta had possibly one of the sternest chins in the history of the sport, but his hothead personality overshadowed his career in the ring, and marred his life outside of it. Standing at 5ft 8in, La Motta may not have been a commanding presence, but out of the 106 total fights he featured in, 83 of them were wins, 4 were draws and 19 of them losses. And most of time, whenever he lost a match it was either down to his self-destructive behaviour, purposeful abandonments, mafia restrictions or boxer favouritism. La Motta had a remarkable career, but his destructive personality and its effects on his life made his existence a tragedy, and Martin Scorseseâ??s cinematic take on his career, Raging Bull, a dramatic feast.\n \nRaging Bull finds Scorsese and De Niro midway into their cinematic affiliation, proving to be a successful duo even when making a sport movie, one which ranks right at the top with Sylvester Stalloneâ??s Rocky. On a lesser note, De Niro and Stallone made another boxing film together, Grudge Match, which saw the two legends re-enter the ring, albeit to laughs rather than Oscars.\n \nHaving found the project and convinced Scorsese to direct it, Robert De Niro chose to play Jake La Motta, and boy did his persistence pay off. De Niro is a shadow of his real self, and I say that as a compliment, because even though we know De Niro to be great in nearly all of his films, his only Oscar winning performance will leave you speechless with awe at how marvellous a character he has created. De Niro put on the muscle, learned to box, and even put on tonnes of make up to mould his damaged and ever transforming nose, cheeks and tough chin, but his greatest achievement is gaining 27kg to portray an older, much more rotund La Motta. His raw, unrelenting persona never breaks stride, even in the face of family, producing a character that drives the story and everything else around it, including the audience. De Niroâ??s passion for the project it appears has paid off for without his central performance, Raging Bull would never have become great.\n \nAnd as De Niro produces a character that dominates the proceedings, the film is played out through the many relationships La Motta destroys. Jake and Joeyâ??s relationship is perhaps most important to Jake, and the one that reveals his true character both at his lowest and highest points of humanity. When Jake turns on his brother, Raging Bull is at its most riveting, and Jakeâ??s life at its most embarrassing, but when he measly attempts to make up with his brother after a long period, we feel his humanity sky-rocketing, and want to help him get across what he has never been able to do before in his life â?? appreciate another human. Joey is the key to Jakeâ??s transformation, but the inability for any character to understand this is the true tragedy of the tale.\n \nJakesâ?? first wifeâ??s inability to cook food rapidly shows just how angry Jake can get over nothing; it is a precursor of what is to come. So you feel for his second wife, Vikki, when she pops along and is completely smitten with Jake. Our inability to warn Vikki of Jakeâ??s temperament draws us in to the point where we fear what Jake could do to her, and that is testament to De Niro once again who breeds life into Jake, where the demons that dictate his personality are brought to the forefront of our awareness. Even as a boxer he is respected by his opponents for his tough, never say die attitude, but this same attitude finds him a loner in the boxing industry. Destroying a young boxer, after Vikki compliments his looks, with no signs or restraint or remorse, we see this story becoming a quest to unravel the many layers that make up Jake La Mottaâ??s mind-set. Paranoia and jealousy are just a few traits corrupting his soul, but what is most revealing is that La Motta does not have the capacity to realise his destructive behaviour, and that is tragic because he is constantly thinking of others and cannot even understand himself.\n \nRaging Bull then is very much a stark, no holds-barred investigation of a manâ??s mental processes who also happens to be a hothead boxer with a tough chin. And that tough chin is significant both in and out of the ring for he could never stop himself from doing it the La Motta way, and failing to understand anything else other than his narrow-minded perception which always produced fireworks, and in turn ruined his social relations that bit more. His self-destructive personality is driven by an animalistic enthusiasm, obsessive rage, sexual envy and relationship-wrecking distrust. These features of his personality constitute a detrimental lifestyle that deteriorates even further before our eyes and believe it or not never gets better. Scorsese masterfully makes us feel this ruin non-stop, never providing our protagonist with marks of humanity, yet we canâ??t help but sympathise with our protagonist and hope one day he can change.\n \nMartin Scorsese is said to not be a fan of sport in general, let alone boxing in particular, yet the way in which he has used the camera to heighten La Mottaâ??s personality and the combative atmosphere should be marvelled at as the work of someone who knows the sport inside out. Raging Bull has been executed in a way that involves you deeper within the mentality of our protagonist. La Mottaâ??s way of seeing things is the way the camera sees things, and so for two hours we are catapulted into the mentality of a raging bull who is always on edge. The black and white look could be a barrier for the audience to get deep into the confines of La Mottaâ??s mind, but it is the complete opposite as it lures us deeper in, showing us the bare, sad existence of our protagonistâ??s mind who sees things plain and clearly but cannot come to terms with the simplicity of life. Instead he makes everything harder on himself and essentially pushes those closest to him away. It truly is a tragic plight in a life that could have had everything.\n \nAmazingly, Jake La Motta is still alive today at 94 years old, proving heâ??s still got a tough chin, even against death. With Raging Bull, La Motta will always be remembered for mostly bad reasons, but that still isnâ??t enough to sway us towards hatred for our indecisiveness towards whether we like La Motta makes the character a cinematic legend, and Raging Bull a classic the entire world should see.\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nMartin Scorseseâ??s Raging Bull is a riveting insight into the mind of boxing legend Jake La Motta, driven by a formidable performance from Robert De Niro, proving the two together are a perfect match.\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??     9/10",

This is a boxing film but it's so much more. Robert De Niro gives one of the best performances of his entrie career. He's likeable yet you hate him at the same time.  His performance is very physically demanding as he had to gain a load of weight and then loose it all again for his next movie. There's a brilliant scene where Jake La Motta just breaks down and starts punching a wall and Robert De Niro gives it his all. Joe Pesci is amazing as Jake's brother. I love how he's the voice of reason to Jake when he suspects his wife sleeping with other men, yet he's still a very violent and aggressive character. The rest of the acting is great but it's those two leads that carry the movie. This film is amazingly directed by the fantastic Martin Scorsese. This is full of all his trademarks and he did an amazing job with this film. The writing is fantastic, a lot of the dialogue leads to very tense seems which is great. The cinematography is excellent, the scenes in the ring are magnificent to look at and there are lots of brilliant long takes. The opening of this film is visually stunning, it's this brilliant wide take with the classical music, it's just amazing. The boxing scenes are brilliant. If you thought the stuff in Rocky or Warrior was brutal they are nothing compared to the boxing scenes here. The boxing scenes are incredibly brutal and have you on the edge of the seat, especially the last boxing match. This film is also brilliantly edited, the film while it feels long it's still very well edited. I also love the ending, the speech from De Niro, the music it's all just amazing. Raging Bull is a fantastic movie and it's one of Martin Scorsese's best. If Rocky is the most iconic boxing movie then in my opinion Raging Bull is the best. A+",

The story is depressing and brutal, and the use of black and white is perfect for this film.  There isn't much \"feel good\"quality in this film - it can be difficult to sit through the first time you watch it.

            "content": "\"The thing ain't the ring, it's the play. So give me a... stage where this bull here can rage and though I could fight I'd much rather recite... that's entertainment.\"\n\nIn 1976 Martin Scorsese teamed up with Robert De Niro and screenwriter Paul Schrader to deliver what in my opinion is one of his best films: Taxi Driver. That year that complex character study lost out on the Oscar to Stallone's Rocky. So what does Scorsese do next? He directs a real boxing movie with another memorable and complex character played by Robert De Niro making Rocky look like a cartoon character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rocky, but Jake La Motta is a character that feels much more authentic. He's deeply flawed and unpleasant to be around with, but his violent temper is what made him such a successful boxer on the ring. It was actually Robert De Niro who approached Scorsese to make this film based on Jake La Motta's autobiographical book and despite hesitating to make a sports movie at first, he ended up directing what is considered by many to be the best boxing film of all time. The boxing scenes are violent and bloody, but what was most surprising for me was the way in which De Niro captured the rage and paranoia of his character off the ring. La Motta isn't a very sympathetic character and his anger and jealous outbursts led him to his ultimate downfall, but somehow there is still something redeeming about him and De Niro captured that essence perfectly in this Award winning performance. It's much more a character study than a boxing film, but Scorsese also explores Jake La Motta's bond with his brother Joey turning this into a sibling relationship study as well. Jake tries to channel his rage through boxing, but ultimately it defeats him outside of the ring destroying the relationships he has formed. Near the end there is a nice nod to Brando's On the Waterfront, which was a perfect touch by Scorsese who seems to always be in control of his craft and at the same time honoring other famous films. Raging Bull is an artistic film dealing with a difficult subject matter but it still is considered by many as the best film from the 80's. It's a near masterpiece in my opinion with another outstanding lead performance by De Niro, who was without a doubt the best actor at that time. \n\nJake La Motta (Robert De Niro) is the raging bull who during the 40's dominated every rival inside the ring. No one could take hits like he did and despite losing a couple fights he took pride in the fact that he never went down.  Jake's brother, Joey (Joe Pesci) is his sparring partner and at the same time he manages his fights so they have a very close relationship. Joey has a few connections with the mob, but Jake refuses to deal with them and wants to get a chance at the title on his own. Joey also introduces him to a fifteen year old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), whom he later marries. As the years go by, Jake defeats his opponents but the title shot keeps eluding him since he refuses to work with the mob despite Joey's connection with Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). While Jake's professional boxing career begins to take off, his personal life takes a blow when he allows his jealousy and paranoia to take over as he fears his wife is seeing other men. Despite channeling his rage in the ring, he also takes it out in his home on his wife and brother. What at first served as his inspiration for becoming a boxing champion escalated so much that it also became his downfall and ruin. Raging Bull centers on Jake's self destructive boxing journey and it is a very complex and emotional one. In the midst of it all there is still a redemptive quality to this antihero and he accepts his punishment through personal beatings in the ring.\n\nI don't know if Scorsese would be around making movies today if it weren't for Raging Bull. Just like his lead character Jake, Scorsese was dealing with some personal demons of his own struggling with drug addiction. De Niro convinced him to make this film and somehow he channeled his addictions through his direction. Jake unsuccessfully channeled his rage in the ring, but Marty found redemption for both of them thanks to Raging Bull. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous and the performances were powerful. De Niro gives another physically demanding performance after his work in Taxi Driver and he once again is very impressive. Joe Pesci is also wonderful as he will later become a recurring actor in other Scorsese films. The chemistry between both actors in this film is really strong and they shine together on screen. The boxing scenes were really raw and violent. They are hard to watch at times, and an extreme close up of dripping blood from the rope in the ring really captured the violence that Scorsese was trying to transmit. Raging Bull is a fascinating film which explores the mind of a very emotionally disturbed man who we wouldn't want to be around with, but somehow Scorsese draws us into his mind and he absorbs us.",

            "content": "Martin Scorcese's adaptation of a boxer's autobiography also contains content adapted (or, less generously, plagiarized) from previous films. The elements of the book that Scorcese emphasizes are the same that were at the core of \"Rocky,\" and it is therefore fair to draw comparisons between the two: an Italian-American boxer who fights an African-American boxer and loses, an overshadowed wife figure, and a short, pudgy brother figure who doubles as a manager. What Scorcese's film does not have is any of the heart and sweetness that made \"Rocky\" enjoyable. Perhaps he hoped to replace the sweetness and light with a more realistic, hardcore sentiment, but he got only as far as the blood and gore and cursing, and forgot to add any meaning. There are no stakes to Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro)'s fights, as there were for Rocky's: Jake's life winds up the same regardless of their outcome. It's difficult to find a reason to care whether he wins or loses, unless you're content to root for him because he's the main character. \"Rocky\" knew that wasn't a good enough reason, and fleshed out its characters and world. If there were no elements of LaMotta's book that could have given some originality and depth to the story, Scorcese should have invented some.\n\nInstead of filling in the story's sizable gaps with original content, Scorcese rips off \"The Godfather\" in completely needless, bizarrely particular ways. There are grainy pictures at a wedding party where everyone is wearing the exact clothes from the beginning of Coppola's movie, and one character even reaches over to bring a woman in a red dress and wide-brimmed hat into the shot. Why import this familiar scene, stripping it of the layers of meaning it enjoyed in its original context? It adds nothing to \"Raging Bull,\" not even the reflected luster of the superior film being copied. Later, during one of many interminable and repetitive domestic abuse scenes, a man chases his wife into a bathroom through a narrow, mirrored side-door. The door swings mostly shut, but he throws it open again. Some of the angles are the same as in that famous, far more important and meaningful scene from \"The Godfather.\" Why such meticulous thievery? Again, it adds nothing to \"Raging Bull,\" but it does serve to remind me of a movie I'd rather be watching, and it causes me to marvel again at the delicate plotting and characterizations that made it work in its native setting.\n\nNear the end, LaMotta deadpans a scene from \"On the Waterfront.\" The audacity. The conceit. Clearly, we're being asked to marvel at how true the words are of LaMotta's life (well, of course they are, the movie has been written that way, and being based on LaMotta's autobiography is no excuse), but I'm not sure what we're supposed to feel during this scene. Are we supposed to feel sad for this wretched stereotype we've spent over two hours with? Are we supposed to take pleasure in the pathetic turn his life has taken? Never having been given a reason to care about anyone or anything on screen, I feel nothing either way. It's simply a bore to watch. There is one thing to be sad about, and that's that DeNiro's career has become uncomfortably like LaMotta's: he, too, has lately been reduced to lazily reading scripts for cash.\n\nScorcese fans, and there are many of them who know far more about movies than I do, will say what they will about Sorcese's technical chops as a filmmaker and his fluency in the history and language of cinema. It seems inexplicable to me that so few critics saw the same \"Raging Bull\" that Pauline Kael saw, about which she wrote, \"Scorsese's excesses verge on self-parody. You can feel the director sweating for greatness, but there's nothing under the scenes... De Niro's portrayal of La Motta is a swollen puppet with only bits and pieces of a character inside.\" That describes the \"Raging Bull\" I watched. Without a story to put Scorcese's talents in service of, they're wasted. \"Raging Bull\" is preening and shallow, and every element in it was done better before and since by filmmakers who understand the primacy of narrative.",

Watching these foundational elements seep through the cracks in its hardened outer shell of repressed human emotion and bravado will always be fascinating to watch on both a psychological and visceral level, particularly for American audiences for which masculinity forms the backbone of their societal ideology. Scorsese's Raging Bull, like his exemplary Taxi Driver, is about this masculinity that pervades every aspect of American life. His \"heroes\" are horrible, abusive people, ignorant and violent, and yet because they're so clearly trapped in the destructive cycle of their nation's misguided social structure we feel for them when they destroy themselves. Watching this evisceration of our elemental makeup is gloriously cinematic and timeless in its effect, Scorsese getting to the heart of what plagues society at large; in doing so, he has created a masterpiece.",

In 1964 we meet a bloated looking LaMotta practicing his words in the dressing room before he goes out to entertain the people of a club. But things quickly switch back to 1941 and the fight against Jimmy Reeves in Cleveland which ended in crowd violence when LaMotta got robbed by the horrible judges. What follows on from there is a look at LaMotta's life his relationship with his brother Joey who is also his manager and his relationship with Vickie who he's attracted to despite already being married. The constant theme of Raging Bull is LaMotta's destructive tendencies both in and outside of the ring. Outside we watch him become paranoid that Vickie is cheating on him this then leads to violent outbursts both physically beating Vickie and also Joey. But we also see his destructive power in the ring as well, purposefully disfiguring another boxer because Vickie had mentioned he was good looking and in doing so provoking LaMotta's jealousy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese never really glorifies LaMotta and bravely delivers one of the most truthful in depth biopics you will ever see. You get a very clear picture of how violent LaMotta could be both inside and out of the ring. But while never glorifying LaMotta Scorsese also gives us a picture of a boxer with great heart. The scenes in the ring are fearsome with destructive power as we watch him destroy his opponents, taking the punches and then exploding in their faces. Speaking of the boxing scenes there is no denying that Scorsese gets across the destructive power and when you see blood spurt from a face following a punch it grabs your complete attention you may even oooh and ahhh. The boxing scenes are like art, beautifully constructed so you can feel the atmosphere, the smoke from the crowds, the steam rising off of bodies as blood drips from wounds all the time delivering the ferocity of punches flying straight at you in a tirade of quick blows. Scorsese has basically constructed some of the best boxing scenes you will ever watch, stylish, atmospheric and brutal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRaging Bull has three stars Joe Pesci as Joey LaMotta, Cathy Moriarty as Vickie LaMotta and Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta. Both Joe and Cathy deliver top performances in my opinion, with Joe himself shedding the pounds to play the role it is Robert De Niro's selfless performance which makes it great. There is of course the physical side, the fact in the scenes which take us back to the early 1940's he looks young and lean in peak shape, but then he piles on the pounds like around 60 pounds in weight to play LaMotta when he retired and just the realism of De Niro's body looking bloated makes it convincing. Then there is the depth of character, the anger and the paranoia, the ability to suddenly snap which he also gets across which is so impressive. It is such a full on performance from De Niro that it never feels like you are watching an actor but a man whose own self destructive nature will be his ultimate downfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRaging Bull is easily one of  the greatest boxing movies ever made. You could also go as far as saying it is one of the great biopics because it's truly in depth, not the pretty storylines which usually dominate the biopic genre. As such it may not be what you expect, but it will impress and leave you with plenty of memories, be it De Niro's performance or the stunning cinematography all in classic black and white. This is a classic that everyone should see.",

Making use of some glorious black and white photography with a cinematography by Michael Chapman and meticulous stylisation which nevertheless never gets in the way of the intensity of the drama that always hints at an imminent danger. This intensity is certainly aided not only by a praiseworthy performance by De Niro, one of the most celebrated in his whole venerable career and certainly one that seems to best represent the self-inflicting pain antics he made use of in portraying a character - almost as if wanting to earn the rights to perform the given character - but also due to his fiery interactions with an equally impressive Joe Pesci cast in the role of Jake LaMotta's brother.

Raging Bull is directed by the great Martin Scorsese, and tells the story of Jake LaMotta a boxer who's rage inside the ring starts to trickle outside as well, causing his life to slowly start to deteriorate. This film makes Rocky look like Ricky 1... okay that may have been an over exaggeration, but you get my point. \n\nThe acting in this film is top notch, Robert De Niro gives an amazing performance as does the rest of the cast. After all these years, De Niro has becoming an acting legend, so it can be hard at times to see the character he's portraying and not the actor, but here his turn is so good, that I forgot I was watching De Niro. The supporting cast is fine, especially Joe Pesci in his first role and Cathy Moriarty who seemed to fall off, despite earning an Oscar nomination for her role here. There are really no weak links in terms of acting here, everyone is spot on, which helped suck me into the film even more. Everyone does a great job and feels genuine. \n\nThe script is great, the dialogue feels real and genuine. The story is great, but it's based off of a true story, so of course it's great. The directing is great, never does the film lose sight of it's goal and every shot is perfectly put together. The cinematography is masterful, especially during the fight scenes and opening credits. The music is great, even if it isn't an original score. The fight scenes, while slightly dated, are great for it's time and have some truly brutal moments. This film is fantastic on a technical level. \n\nThis film is a very sad watch, so don't expect an upbeat Rocky ending. I can now see why this film is regarded as one of the best of all time. The story is great, the acting is fantastic, the directing is amazing, the cinematography is phenomenal, I can go on. I highly reccomend that if you haven't seen this film, to see it as soon as possible. It's a masterpiece that shouldn't be missed especially by film-lovers like yourselves. Bravo again, Mr. Scorsese. \n\nOverall: Wonderful acting, technically brilliant, deserves all the praise it gets today. \n\nFinal Score: 10/10 CERTIFIED KICK-ASH!",

Its not an accident the screenplay isn't concern by it's fighting strategy. For Jake LaMotta, the fighter is controlled not by tactics but by fears and drives.\n\nConsumed with rage after his wife, Vickie, describes one of his opponent's as 'Good looking', then pound the f**k out of the man's face, and a mafia boss in the audience leans over to his lieutenant, \"He ain't pretty no more.\" After the punishment was delivered, Jake (Robert De Niro) doesn't look at his opponents, he looks at Vickie (Cathy Moriarty).\n\nThis is the movie that is considered the finest of its decade. Even both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel both called Martin Scorsese's film the Best film of the 1980's.\n\nWhile working on The Godfather 2, De Niro was reading \"Raging Bull: My story,\" and sent the story to his friend Scorsese. He at first, reluctant to do it, claiming he has no idea what it is, Raging Bull? He felt boxing was boring, even as a kid. Also, his personal addiction to cocaine and lithium-leaving him hospitalised with internal bleeding. Then sent it to screenwriters Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver) and Mardik Martin to do the screenplay. Scorsese decided to do it for De Niro's sake, not only his life is saved but save what remained of his career.\nThey won Oscars for De Niro and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, also nominated for Best Picture, director, and supporting actor and actress for Joe Pesci and Moriarty. It lost Best Picture to Ordinary People.\n\nDe Niro actually got to spend time with LaMotta so he can portray him accurately as and do some training, entering three genuine Brooklyn boxing matches and won two. LaMotta said, De Niro had the ability of a fighter and would of been happy if he was his trainer. De Niro had to gain 60 pounds to play the later years.\n\nLaMotta's biggest opponent is not his wife, brother, or people in the ring, but himself.It can be painful in the personal life.\n\n\"Raging Bull\" is truly searing and a cinematic classic, that addresses unflinching, animalistic behavior of a man in need of redemption. Robert De Niro is a master and the cast and him make this individual a compelling view.",

            "content": "While shooting \"The Godfather Part II\", Robert DeNiro found himself reading the book \"Raging Bull: My Story\", based on the life of 1950's middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta. It was a story he felt very passionate about bringing to the screen and took it to his good friend, Martin Scorsese. Scorsese was, at first, reluctant to do a boxing movie as \"Rocky\" had recently been released to massive success and he, himself, was going through a personal crisis at the time due to the failure of their previous collaboration \"New York, New York\" and his spiralling addiction to cocaine and lithium - leaving him hospitalised with internal bleeding. They brought in screenwriter's Mardik Martin (\"Mean Streets\") and Paul Schrader (\"Taxi Driver\") and the film eventually went ahead. It became a form of therapy for Scorsese and has since been lauded as a cinematic tour-de-force and voted - in numerous polls - as the best film from the 1980's.\n Italian-American, middleweight boxer, Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro) has inner demons and is prone to obsessive rage and sexual jealousy which threatens to destroy his relationship with his wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) and brother/trainer Joey (Joe Pesci). In the ring, he a prizewinner but it's outside it, that he seems to lose everything.\n On the surface, Raging Bull could be seen as just another boxing biopic, much like Denzel Washington's portrayal of Ruben \"Hurricane\" Carter, Russell Crowe's Jim \"The Cinderella Man\" Braddock or Will Smith's Muhammad \"Ali\". Scorsese and DeNiro's vision is an altogether different one, though. It's not their intention to glamourise LaMotta or deliver a conventional film about pugilism. Their intentions lie in exposing the man beyond the ring - where his real fights took place. The biggest opponent for \"The Bronx Bull\" was actually himself and his struggle with a raging, psychosexual insecurity and his propensity for self-destruction. It's here that DeNiro fully takes centre stage in what is, unequivocally, his finest moment (and that's saying something) throughout an illustrious career of exceptionally strong performances. His transformation is near miraculous; while researching and preparing for the role, De Niro actually spent the entire shoot with LaMotta so he could portray him accurately and went through extensive physical training, entering into three genuine Brooklyn boxing matches and winning two of them. According to La Motta, De Niro had the ability to be a professional fighter and that he would have been happy to have been his manager and trainer. Following this, production was stopped for two months so DeNiro could pile on 60 pounds to portray LaMotta in his older years. His commitment to the role (and project) has now become legendary and highly respected amongst his peers. Quite simply, DeNiro's smouldering (and deservedly Oscar winning) display is an absolute masterclass in the profession.\n Scorsese's skills manifest in his operatic approach; he's less interested in cranking up the tension or theatrics of the bouts and more focused on the punishing brutality of the sport. He employs the use of flashbulbs, and several different sound effects - like smashing glass and squelching watermelons -  to achieve an overall crunching effectiveness. He's aided immeasurably by Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing technique and Michael Chapman's sublime, monochrome, cinematography which serves the film as a whole in it's mood and noir-ish atmosphere. If the bouts in the ring are claustrophobic then the same could be said for the 'quieter' moments outside it; LaMotta's personal life is uncomfortably scrutinised in his abuse towards his wife Vickie and brother Joey. There are very personal scenes of fraught and jealous conversations that are unbearably tense, and fully depict how much of a brute this man really was. It's testament to the commitment of the entire cast and crew that this highly unappealing individual can make such compelling viewing.\n A truly searing, cinematic classic, that addresses the unflinching, animalistic, behaviour of a man in need of absolution and redemption. It also happens to possess one of cinema's most breathtaking and riveting performances. On this evidence, there's no question that Robert DeNiro is a master of his craft and it's arguably Martin Scorsese's finest work as well.\n\nMark Walker",

His movies would conventional and feel like great movies, on paper they very well could be great movies, but it never felt to me they were. Hugo was excellently directed, but was a great bore for me. The Departed was intriguing and exciting with great performances, but the direction and editing felt out of place at times. Gangs of New York was overall strange and just doesn't belong in his filmography. The Aviator, which out of all those I enjoyed the most, was wonderful with a surprising performance by Dicaprio, but one scene, just one scene changed the outcome of what the film was and it didn't know where it was going halfway through. I feel the same way about Raging Bull, as if it didn't know where it was going, but I can sure tell you, before my reviews on Scorcese always had negatives, but this film sure had the best of positives, being his very best film I have seen yet. \r\n\r\n   Raging Bull is about Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro, a boxer in the 40s, who goes through relationships and hardships to get his hand on the boxing middle weight title. His brother, Joey (Joe Pesci), is his manager and helps take him to the top. The films is about relationships more than boxing, and character more than action. Boxing seems like a side show in the film, making a filler for the life of LaMotta rather than being his main destiny in the movie. At first, it doesn't seem like that. At first, the film feels like a glorious boxing film, with the openining credit shot being of Jake LaMotta warming up in the rink. It looks amazing, and you know your going to be in a boxing thrill. But as the film goes on, it slowly changes fro realtistic, brutal fighting, to relationships and cheating problems. The chemistry, though, was great, making up for the waning plot element, and you are fully invested in how this man deals with different situations. But as the film progresses, it is no longer a relationship movie either, but graudally turns into a character study. An interesting, well directed character study, yes, but the film goes off track way to much, and would've been amazing if it kept the brutal boxing theme and made more boxing sequences.\r\n\r\nThat leads me to discuss the boxing in the film. Overall, this is where the direction shines. Brutal, violent, and extremely realistic. Excellent and emotional, the fighting is actually scary to watch and you almost wish you were out of the rink. Scorcese does some of his best direction during his scenes, and if the whole film was just more and more boxing, I would have been equally content. But no, the film throws a lot more at you that you dont see coming. DeNiro's performance as LaMotta wows, and is excellent and realistic. His anger and his arragonce are clearly shown throughout the film, and even though you root for him the whole way, you kind of feel he's become a douchebag later in the movie. And when the movie takes a character, changes him and makes him a douchebag, and you still root for him, that's when a film is great. Joe Pesci also gives an excellent performance, but I felt the character of Vicki was quite dull, and Cathy Moriarty's performance of her bored me and was bland. Maybe it was the character, or it was her acting, but either way I felt very unattached to her. \r\n\r\nRaging Bull also boasts a very true message. It teaches if you become big, become tough and a winner from the dust, never forget the people who brought you there. Don't let your arrogance take over, because you didn't get to the finish line by yourself. A beautiful and honest message, one that fits perfectly with characters such as these.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I thought Raging Bull was a suspenseful, brutal film, with intriguing relationships and excellent character development. DeNiro shines with amazing acting skill, and his transition from a loser, to a winner, to a prick is masterful. Although the film slides off track on what it should've stayed on, an American boxing film, the new tracks it rides on are as interesting, but deffinetly not as captivating. A film about honesty and arrogance, and gives the characters true American morals, I give Raging Bull a 9/10.",

Raging Bull is yet another masterpiece by director Martin Scorsese, everything is done flawlessly in my eyes. Two of Scorsese's previous writers, Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver) and Mardik Martin (Mean Streets), write the movie's script and it truly is a brilliant script. The story is truly remarkable, the dialogue is fantastic, and the characters are just so realistic and that's one of the main reasons why the story works. One of the reasons why the story is so effective is because it's grounded in reality, you could believe this could happen and that works out for the best because this story actually did happen. Scorsese does another brilliant job at directing this movie, the one thing Scorsese does the best is directing the actors because all his movie's are character driven and he always manages to get his actors to give incredible performances. Robert De Niro gives a spectacular performance as Jake LaMotta and is one of the best performances of his career. The supporting cast is fantastic which includes great performances from Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty. One thing that I find very cool about this movie is that it's shot almost entirely in black and white and I thought that added a lot of the realism in the movie. The cinematography was just so beautiful and unique because it was shot in black and white, plus the boxing scenes in this movie were well filmed and choreographed. One last thing, the score to this movie is just brilliant and beautiful. Overall Raging Bull is a marvelous film and is yet another Scorsese classic.",

The film tells the story of the career of the fighter Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) and the rise of his career, and while his life. To the poor living fighter with a nagging wife being sponsored by the youngest brother; his tremendous winning streak; to his fall into depression.\nThe film follows, as I said before, like a biography but more exploits man. The rise in his life, and the consequences that it has brought to him. The steering black and white that Martin Scorsese uses is fantastic, giving those who watch the film to feel in place of Jake inside and outside the ring. Leaving it to those who attend feel the claustrophobia and fatigue that Jake faces during fights, and also during times of his family life.\nThe entire cast is terrific, Cathy Moriarty (Vickie La Motta) formidable and charming; Joe Pesci (Joey) excellent as always, Robert De Niro .....

Rocky Balboa was a man who wanted to make a name for himself, while Jack la Motta was always cruel, blunt, violent, and self-destructive. More importantly, Rocky was in colour, while Raging Bull, through the whole movie, was in black and white. In a way, the monochrome style actually helps to show that it's not like Rocky in any way. The characters all emote powerfully, and the story stands out really well. However, I really think it's one of those things that's art  over entertainment.",

With films such as rocky and other boxing films rising, Scorsese decided black and white would be different and it surely works with a daily star look, the film is an asthetical work of art aswell as a indepth story of a man who wants to make it on his own, he only accepts the help of his brotherJoey (Joe Pesci) while the temptation of underworld help is always there, you can't help but see a similarity to On The Waterfront with Marlon Brando.\nJake lamotta is a boxer who's life is as entertaining in the ring as it is in his personal life, His weight fluxuates more than Gordon Ramsey says the F word, his relationships are that of a yoyo one minute he is the nicest man in the world, the next he will make a shell and wont let anyone get in the way of how he feels.\nOverall Raging Bull is a film worth watching more than a few times in order to appreciate the trademark psychological man who is at war with himself, a masterpiece.",

            "content": "This was an absolutely awesome movie, that was one of the best films that Robert De Niro.  This is the back and white Rocky, but way better.  The beginning was like the black and white version of Rocky, but soon became something way darker, and much more deep.  The fact that it was in black and white made the films themes, and plot seem even more dark, and tough.  This is probably the darkest boxing film I have seen so far, because of the abusive relationships, and how he just goes downhill.\n\nThis was the third time Martin Scorsese worked with Robert De Niro, but the first time Robert De Niro worked with Joe Pesci.  The combination of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese had been proven a great one in films like Mean Streets (1972), and Taxi Driver (1976), and became greater with this film, and just got even greater over time.  This is just the third classic they did together, but it is the first one Robert De Niro did with Joe Pesci, and that too was also proved a great duo in this film.  Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci went on to do Goodfellas (1990), and Casino (1995).  Well I know this is a very repetitive paragraph, but I made it that way to get the point across that this was the beginning of a great trio.  Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci acted in Once Upon A Time In America (1984), and A Bronx Tale (1993) together without martin Scorsese directing.  The two have so much chemistry as actors.  When you see all of the films they were in with each other they also had different types of relationships with each other, which showed what great actors they both were, and how great they are together.\n\nIn this film Joe Pesci plays Joey LaMotta, who is Jake LaMotta's brother.  This was when people started paying attention to him actually.  Joey helped his brother with his career, and deal with the mob, and to try to keep his brother from going insane.  Robert De Niro played Jake LaMotta.  Jake LaMotta was a very paranoid, abusive, and irrational man who abused his wife, and everybody around him.  I think the fact that he was such an abusive and nasty person is what allowed him to be such a great boxer.  He truly was a Raging Bull in the boxing ring, hence the title.  He beat his wife after she said that the boxer who he would be fighting against in his next match was handsome.  I think that is why he was paranoid.  He seemed to be really scared of losing everything.  At one point he asked his brother if he had slept with his wife.  His brother refused to answer that and left, then later he beat his wife because he thought she slept with him.  Then he goes to his brother's house and attacks him in font of his whole family.  That was when the relationship he had with any person in his life was ruined.  The film is about his rise and fall.  He slowly started cracking up, and sinking farther and farther.  The film was very dark and depressing.  It was amazing though.\n\nThis film is my fourth favorite Robert De Niro film after Awakenings (1990), Goodfellas (1990), Godfather II (1974).  However I think that this was his most incredible acting job.  At first he is this championship boxer, in great shape, then he puts on over 40 pounds in about two weeks, because Jake LaMotta put on a ton of weight later in his career.  It really shows when you cannot only play a role that is completely out of character for him, but you also change yourself physically for a role.  The best actors become the characters they play and he truly did in this film.  That is why it was one of the most amazing acting jobs of all time.  His character was like Carl Rizzi in the Godfather.  Abusive, and a scumbag.  He sounded like a younger Veto Corleone with his accent.  Robert De Niro is my favorite actor for both his incredible ability to act, and because of his phenomenal filmography, which I celebrate almost all of it.",

But I gotta be honest, I was very underwhelmed.  I generally love De Niro movies, and Martin Scorsese movies, but this just didn't work for me as much as I thought it would.  The performances are all great, and De Niro absolutely deserved the Oscar.  But the movie is slow, and watching it seems more like an \"important\" movie than an \"entertaining\" one.  Like, the type of movie you see once and that's all you need.  Made more for the \"art\" of the movie, than the \"popcorn\" value, I guess. It's the story of Jack La Motta a famous middleweight boxer in the 40's and 50's and chronicles his career from the ring to hosting a night club in retirement, and all the ups and downs of his personal life in between.  The boxing scenes are great, and I really loved the Sugar Ray Robinson scenes, but when the movie veered away from the ring, it just stalled for me.  I may try to watch this again sometime, and hopefully my opinion changes.",

Full-bore, non-stop compelling direction plays viewer's emotions like a harp, delivering one painful scene after another, with dazzling (though brutal) boxing sequences. Opening is hypnotic, finale is perhaps the most devastating moment on celluloid. Robert De Niro gives the most devoted performance in movie history (he gained 60 pounds for the role).

            "content": "Raging Bull is a masterpiece. In my opinion, Scorsese's second best film behind Taxi Driver. He is genius with the camera in the ring. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is perfect. The quick cuts are poetic. Robert De Niro is brilliant in this picture even though his character isn't. He plays a self destructive man who is spiraling out of control. He is rude, impatient, paranoid and oh, so violent! Yet, at the end of the film, you feel sorrow for such a monster and you hate yourself for it. Scorsese certainly does bring out the best in De Niro. This is much more than a boxing movie. Much, much more! It's a film you can't describe with words. You have to see it to believe it's brilliance.",

I can tell the truth...that this film scared me, haunted me and enthralled me, and I don't know who to thank the most, the screenwriters, Scorsese, De Niro with that purely spellbinding performance...\n\n...I truly must thank them and everyone else, for this film gets it all right. In fact, to me, it even sets the standard, not as to what a movie should be, but to what it *can* be; to what heights a motion picture could possibly hope to aspire. That's just me, though, don't take me wrong, I might be overreacting a bit right now (I also think my use of semicolons might be slightly off); but believe me, this is undeniably top-notch moviemaking, and Scorsese and De Niro in their prime.\n \nP.S. I think I now understand why De Niro made so many terrible movies later in his career: after doing something as fantastic as this (among some other great ulterior performances), there is simply nothing he can do to compensate, to completely stain his reputation! He doesn't have to worry about that anymore (just a thought).\nMmmh, I have a feeling these reviews -or rather, reactions-, are getting increasingly over-the-top... maybe I should quit XD",

I never knew just how good Robert De Niro was of an actor until seeing this. Okay, yes, he was good in the Godfather: Part II, but he's not really in it that much compared to Al Pacino. this film also enhances my belief of black and white being much more mysterious and stylized than color. it really makes the story much more intense and makes the boxing scenes completely unforgettable. I don't see how anyone could forget De Niro questioning Pesci about if he slept with De Niro's wife. Please, if you have not seen this masterpiece from Scorcese, then you need to see it.",

Yet, by the end you understand just exactly what he wanted to convey to the audience. \n                   Although considered a masterpiece, I would say its his finest film, yet a great watch!",
