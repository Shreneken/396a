The two are convinced they can earn the money by getting their old band back together. However, after playing several gigs and making a few enemies, including the police, the brothers face daunting odds to deliver the money on time.",

That being said, the Songs are all incredible, the action chases are entertaining and make you go wow while your laughing how over the top it all is. The editing very well done as well. Overall it all comes together to a really fun and memorable time never feeling generic. The Key here is how self aware the film is never taking itself too serious with its All Star Cast.

On its own, it is based on a Saturday Night Live sketch about two white characters with pretensions of being blues musicians. Add a number of major real-life blues musicians and an even larger number of car crashes, and that's the recipe for the movie.\n\nThe premise is about two brothers, one just out of Joliet prison, who try to raise money to save an orphanage from closing down, and to do so, bring together the members of their old band. Of course, their efforts to do so end up causing trouble with the law, as well as other people (such as a country and western-themed bar and the band that was supposed to play there). In the end, dozens of police cars chase after them, and even the National Guard, before they fulfill their quest. There are some genuinely funny parts, but overall the whole movie depends on exaggeration-twenty police cars crashing into twenty police cars, as critic Roger Ebert had put it.",

Marvel at the comedic timing & instincts of John Belushi & Dan Ackroyd, at the absolute top of their game.  Glory in the great R&B numbers, delivered by the industry legends who made these hits.

            "content": "Blues Brothers features some KILLER musical numbers featuring some of the greatest performers of all time (Franklin, Brown, Charles & more). The superstar cameos are like a walk through the memory lane of America's great Blues, R&B, & Soul legends. The humor big, insane, and over the top. The practical stunts & explosions are massive and continue to up the ante throughout the film, just when you thought it couldn't get any bigger- it does. They must have destroyed nearly 100 vehicles in the making of the movie, and several buildings also get obliterated- all for the sake of comedic slapstick action. It does become a bit exhausting towards the end of its 150 minute runtime, as the final chase scene becomes more, and more bombastic and large scale. Most of the situational humor is genuinely funny, although it can become a bit much at times. The big moments (where cars are crashing, buildings and getting smashed, and our protagonists continue to be unfazed by the madness around them) cause some big laughter. Aretha Franklin has the standout musical number in my opinion- although seeing James Brown, Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker was also a blast. I think they could've shaved off 20-30 minutes and the movie would be paced a little better- the big cameo numbers are pretty much done by the end of the second act and since for me- those were the high points- the third act drags on a bit. But overall it is a fun ride, and especially for lovers of music. It's also fun to see Carrie Fisher play a psychotic, bitter, & violent ex-lover to Belushi.",

            "content": "A chaotic ride full of blues and soul.\n\nJohn Landis' absurdist musical comedy The Blues Brothers (1980) is really hilarious. John Landis goes all out with his cozy Chicago feel and reckless madness with his direction. Landis uses his dry humor with a dramatic tone that kicks into gear with insanely dangerous car chases, brutal stunts, powerful live performances, and deadpan delivery of the two charismatic leads. Landis' direction is very steady as he takes you on a joy ride around Chicago and Illinois. His close-ups are very fun, but his wide shots during the car chases and mall wrecking sequences are impressive. How Landis even managed to get all those police cars, the tank, and the army extras for that finale is beyond me.\n\nJohn Landis is clearly quite funny. His sense of humor is so silly and endearing that you cannot help but love The Blues Brothers. They were sent on a holy mission from God after all. John Landis wrote The Blues Brothers with the scatterbrained Dan Aykroyd for a feast of action, witty deadpan humor, and a love of Chicago blues. The Blues Brothers is certainly John Landis' greatest film with poignant soul songs to energetic blues tunes, The Blues Brothers has it all!\n\nDan Aykroyd and John Belushi kill it as Elwood Blues and Jake Blues. Aykroyd's manic goofball is gone and replaced by a stoic anti-hero and crazy car driver with a hilarious deadpan delivery that makes Elwood so funny. Belushi's anger and frustration as Jake is very funny, and he's amazing as he pleads for forgiveness from Carrie Fisher. Aykroyd and Belushi have this lackadaisical rapport and comedic chemistry that cannot be replicated. Deborah Nadoolman's iconic black suits for Elwood and Jake are still cool to me. \n\nI must mention the cast of celebrity cameos is astounding as John Landis gets everyone from Cab Calloway and James Brown to Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. John Candy has a great cameo as a confident cop. John Lee Hooker's street performance is pure blues as far as I'm concerned. Twiggy and Carrie Fisher's cameo scenes are very cute. Look carefully and see if you can spot Frank Oz, Steven Spielberg, and even John Landis himself! In all, The Blues Brothers' cast is second to none.\n\nGeorge Folsey Jr.'s editing saves The Blues Brothers' massive 148 minute long run-time. He cuts away from any scene that drags, but he does let the songs just play out for your enjoyment. Stephen M. Katz' cinematography is really pretty and gritty. His tender close-up shots of Elwood and Jake as they struggle to drive around and form their band is really neat. Katz' shots during the car chases are too wild. He shoots with a Chicago breakneck style like Risky Business or Ferris Bueller's Day Off. You can clearly see The Blues Brothers' influence on these films as well as Ghostbusters, Tenacious D, Wayne's World, and Canadian Bacon among others. Elmer Berstein's score is very nice and subdued for such an absurd comedy.\n\nIn all, The Blues Brothers holds up nicely.",

This film takes away the seriousness and allows some escapism from everyday life. The scale of some of the over-the-top practical stunts and amazing musical talent makes this movie nothing short of a masterpiece.\n\nThe plot is a real simple one. The Blues Brothers must raise $5,000 to save their childhood orphanage from being taken by the state. Along the way, the brothers get chased by cops, Nazis, and a crazy ex-girlfriend. Even with the world against them, the brothers cannot fail because they know that they're \"on a mission from God.\" Lots of real chemistry and subplots between each character in the movie add to the fun.\n\nAll the cameos and star-spotting is extra fun.

Over forty years later, is it at all regrettable that a blues band fronted by two white comedians had to serve as its catalyst for crossing over into the larger cultural conversation?\n\nHindsight is always 20/20, and 1980 was the proverbial different world then. But with the possible exception of similarly stark white blues champions The Rolling Stones, one could argue that no musical or cinematic vehicle has so successfully introduced the brilliance of an underrepresented art form to such a massive crossover audience. Granted, there's not much question that bits of \"The Blues Brothers\" now feel like we're watching something being worn that's been borrowed from someone else's closet (see: the church and street market scenes). Then again, there's also little question that Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi are emotionally entrenched in these transformative tunes (they started the Blues Brothers band before the film took form, and it was loaded with African-American blues legends). Nor is it in doubt that this music comedy almost singularly kicked in the door to allow an army of descendant films to pour in.\n\nPerhaps there's an argument that one way or the other, \"The Blues Brothers\" has become even more engrossing today exactly because of these nuanced dynamics. Play it loud and find out. - WATCHED IT? THEN WATCHLIST: \"Stadium Anthems,\" \"Sausage Party,\" \"South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.\"",

The rapor between Belushi and Aykroyd is great. I believe them as brothers. And I believe them when they say \"we're on a mission from God.\"\nWhilst filming, a world record was broken for most amount of cars destroyed in a film. You'll see why when you watch the film. There's never a dull moment in this picture. Jokes, music, slapstick, chases, Nazis, cops, 80s nostalgia hits, it's just great fun. The cast is amazing. Arethra Franklin, Cab Calloway, James Brown, Frank Oz, John Candy, Carrie Fisher, Ray Charles and many more. That is reason alone to see it. I'm constantly quoting this film too. It's one of those.

            "content": "A surprisingly large number of movies have been based on Saturday Night Live sketches over the years. The Blues Brothers was one of the more critically successful of these films. The Blues Brothers begins with Jake Blue being released from prison, only to find that the orphanage where he and his brother Elwood grew will close in less than 2 weeks if the pair cannot raise $5,000 in legitimate money to pay outstanding property taxes. Their quest to rebuild their old band and raise this money by playing R&B inadvertently pits them against the police, the neo-Nazis, a rival country-western band, and a surprisingly well-armed young woman of unknown motives. Along the way, there will be lots of car chases and musical numbers.\n\nI'm not much of a music critic, but the musical numbers in The Blues Brothers were some of my favorite parts of the film. The best musical numbers implore the audience to buy a copy of the soundtrack and listen to the music independently of the film, and this film made me take a serious interest in the artists whose work is on display. Some of these artists even appear in the film, as, against resistance from the studio, the creators wisely cast notable soul musicians in many of the supporting roles. Even the two leads, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, who are better known as actors, had substantial musical experience. The dancing in these scenes is also nicely choreographed, with characters performing flips and leaping into the air, and often involves an impressive number of extras.\n\nThe other highlight of the film is undoubtedly the car chases. Allegedly, The Blues Brothers broke the record for the largest number of automobiles destroyed in a film shoot. The first car chase is impressive enough, with the cars crashing through a shopping mall in a scene which is both exciting and chock full of product placement (\"The new Oldsmobiles are in early this year!\"). By the finale, however, the scale of the car chases has reached ludicrous levels, with seemingly everyone in the state gunning for the brothers. \n\nAs the film's origin as a recurring sketch on SNL would suggest, The Blues Brothers is a comedy, and the film contains some genuinely amusing moments. Even the car chases are filmed in a comedic manner, with slapstick sensibilities. My favorite comedic moment, however, is the result of Jake cursing in the presence of the nun in charge of the orphanage. Kathleen Freeman, incidentally, gives the nun an air of righteous menace despite being the source of the humor in that scene, a dichotomy I quite enjoy. The jokes in the film are also, with a couple notable exceptions, free of adolescent sexual or toilet humor. The worst criticism I can levy against The Blues Brothers is that some of the antagonists are perhaps a tad underutilized - we know nothing about the country band except that they don't have a union permit - although even this is a reach. Otherwise, The Blues Brothers has a trifecta - good music, good jokes, and good action.",

The Blues Brothers is a decent film, however the premise goes on far too long. If the movie was an hour and a half rather than two and a half, I would've given it a higher score. The characters are all likable, and the beginning angles and dialogue were promising. Yet, as the \"story\" pressed on their simple minded motive, and repetitive chase scenes became humdrum. Even the spontaneous sing-along numbers became wearisome as some incorporated it into the story, while others played it off as a musical number.

The infectious dance numbers, the joy-inducing cameos, the bombastic set pieces. It's all fairly enjoyable and - in fact - I enjoyed a lot of it. It's just that, even though there's a general throughline here, there's also this episodic nature to the majority of the second act that didn't really dazzle me in any way. Jake and Elwood have to go to X place and get X person to do X, they do it, and then have to go to X place and get X person to do X as well. It's all too piecemeal for my tastes.

They are trying to raise 5,000 dollars to save their own catholic school. He and his brother Elwood (Aykroyd), start going across different restaurants and bars all in an effort to get the band together. \n\nDespite some resistance from some of the former crew, they assemble.\nIn the process, they do nothing short of enraging cops, driving through a Nazi rally and pissing off quite a few rednecks. They also have an assassin (Carrie Fischer) trying to kill them. There are quite a few musical numbers as well. They have to put it all together and give quite a performance as they manage to fill a venue of 5,000 folks. The film shows some range with a pretty respectable action chase sequence as well. \n\nBlues Brothers is an understated and original comedy. The film never tries to be over the top and aim for slapstick, or really any other bits. The film simply presents itself and has you determine if you find it funny or not. Some of the funniest parts for the film for me were the constant assassination attempts by Fischer that failed, and the Blues Brothers just keep on going as if nothing happened. The musical numbers are never expected, but they fit the film well and include various musicians from James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles to give the film some heart and soul. Blues Brothers is a tough film to diagnose and I respected it more for the manner at which it was presented than I did the movie itself. I can't help but wonder if I would have enjoyed this film more at the height of its popularity and when the characters were more popular on SNL. In any case Belushi is so charismatic somehow, he carries the film. \n\n-2.10.2017",

I genuinely didn't know what to expect with their film, and was somewhat surprised by what I got. There are really 3 big aspects to this film that a viewer can enjoy, and 2 of them worked great. Sadly, the one aspect of The Blues Brothers that didn't click for me was probably the most important one...the comedy. I didn't find the humor all that funny. I might have chuckled once after a prat fall. But most of the silly behavior and other odd things they included, while I could see they were shooting for a laugh, didn't elicit one from me. The joy of this film is that it doesn't rely totally on those jokes that fell flat. The 2nd big aspect of the movie is that it has some superb music. They sprinkle legendary singers throughout the cast and give them the opportunity to show what truly great music is all about. These musical breaks were by far the high points of The Blues Brothers, and had me tapping my toes. What took me completely by surprise was the 3rd big element you will find throughout The Blues Brothers...the quantity, length, and complexity of the car chases. I would guess that at least half the budget must have gone to getting cars to wreck and stunt drivers, because these scenes are everywhere in the film. I'm always impressed by genuine (pre-computer graphics) stunts, and these drivers pulled off some great ones.\n\nWhile there were a couple elements of the film that I liked, I had a struggle identifying with or caring about the main characters. This film features a pair of protagonists who are the worst con men ever, they are criminals, and they seem uncaring about hurting the people around them. In other words, they're selfish jerks. Then they use the excuse of \"a mission from God\" to justify their continued selfish actions. We are presented with a motive that is supposed to appear altruistic so that we will be on their side, but I didn't see the virtue in this Catholic home that made it such a worthy cause. Of course, I have to remember this is all comedy. As a result, I'm probably putting too much thought and logic into the setup and just need to roll with it. Yet, even in a comedy, I feel like they owe me the opportunity of liking the protagonists. Complaints aside, there was enough fun stuff going on in The Blues Brothers that I enjoyed watching it. It's certainly not a film I will seek out again, but I think I can see the elements that made many people fall in love with the characters back in the 80s.",

The songs that they play are really memorable, which is funny that in some times they just play it at random.

The soundtrack is great and the list of singers they managed to get to perform in the film really encapsulates some of the best singers of that generation.

There's likely to be a tinge of nostalgia or reminiscence, making it difficult to judge it objectively. That said, sometimes the film is just so much fun and so enjoyable that you know why you hold it in such high regard in the first place. Without a shadow of a doubt, The Blues Brothers is (still) that kind of film.\n\nWhen \"Joliet\" Jake Blues (John Belushi) is released from prison, he and his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) pay a visit to the old Catholic home where they grew up. They soon find out that the orphanage is to be shut down due to lack of funds. As a result, Jake and Elwood go on a mission to re-form their old blues band and raise the money required.\n\nSay what you will about the comedic talents of Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler or Mike Myers but they share something in common in terms of making their name on comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live. These names are just three of the shows recent successful comedians but having, personally, been born in the late 70's and grew up throughout the 80's, most of the comedies I was exposed to were filled with the familiar faces that actually had a hand in the origins of this show - Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and, of course, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. In fact, The Blues Brothers is an adaptation of a short sketch that first aired on Saturday Night Live and is one of only two successful film adaptations from the show - the other being Wayne's World.\n\nHowever, despite this films success, it was actually fraught with production problems and a budget that got way out control. Firstly, Dan Aykroyd's script was a massive 324 pages (three times longer than a normal screenplay) which he jokingly bound in the cover of the Yellow Pages before delivering it to John Landis to edit it down. Also, Landis' outlandish car chases and vehicular pile-up's throughout the end of the film sent the budget $10million over it's initial $17.5. This wasn't helped by John Belushi's spiralling drug habit which would cause him to disappear for lengthy periods from the set.\n\nThese issues aside, though, The Blues Brothers still struck a chord with audiences and critics alike - even the Vatican gave it the thumbs-up for being a good Catholic movie - and it has since went on to become a cult classic. Over 30 years later, it's easy to see why...\n\nThe story doesn't really amount to very much but the titular characters are hard to resist as they ooze a laid-back cool, dressed in their iconic black suits and dark Ray-Bans - a good ten years before Tarantino's similarly attired Reservoir Dogs. Jake and Elwood manage to get themselves in all sorts of scrapes and upset a whole horde of different people; a machine gun, bazooka wielding disgruntled ex-girlfriend (Carrie Fisher), the Illinois Nazi Party, country band The Good Ol' Boys and, not to mention, the sheer tally of cops, all in hot pursuit. It's riotously over the top and when the film reaches it's denouement it has already crossed the ridiculous border but Landis and Aykroyd know this. They simply don't care. And that's what makes the film so enjoyable. There's an unashamedly free-spirited nature to the proceedings which is highly infectious but nothing entertains more than the magnificent musical numbers from a choice selection of Soul and R&B talents. Among the many toe-tapping highlights are Aretha Franklin's \"Think\", Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher\", John Lee Hooker's \"Boom Boom\" and the great Ray Charles with \"Shake a Tail Feather\". \n\nThe Blues Brothers has stood the test of time and truly is one of a kind. It's provides action, laughs and song and dance numbers that haven't aged a bit. It's admittedly raucous, loud and chaotic but as far as I'm concerned, anything goes when you're \"on a mission from God\".\n\nMark Walker",

Jake, who has been released from Joliet Prison, and has reunited with his brother, along with a scheme up his sleeve.\nJake wants to reunite ''the band'', and Elwood takes some time to think about if The Blues Brothers should reunite, or if he should continue selling cars for microphones, and commencing car chases inside of malls. \nElwood decides. Of course, the band must be united, but sadly, the band members, who are real-life, talented musicians, have gone their separate ways. The brothers then go all out in Chicago to find and bribe their members help make The Blues Brothers have a great return. \nI must say, this movie is odd. It's weird. Somehow, John Landis and his incredible cast manage to deliver us a film that has a brilliant flow and memorable scenes that we can't help but like it. First of all, the comedy is hilarious.

I'll bet anyone that more cars were destroyed in this film than the first season of ''The Dukes of Hazzard''.\nSpeaking of that great cast, you will see plenty of notable musicians and actors, such as Aretha Franklin, Cab Galloway, James Brown, Ray Charles, Steve Lawrence, John Candy, and even Steven Spielberg.\nYes, you will see plenty of bizarre, and not to mention, random things in The Blues Brothers.

            "content": "It's over the top, and it seems more focused on style and car chases, but it's the style and unpredictable humour that, in my opinion, reinforce this film's appeal. The plot can be a little difficult to follow sometimes, mainly because the film tends to get sidetracked by all the wacky, seemingly random gags and characters. While some of the jokes can seem random, it's not a machine gun of comedy, and at least the jokes have some relevance to the plot, even if that relevance comes later on. The performances from the film's main cast are very good, even if some of the characters aren't as special, and I find the main characters to be really appealing. The film certainly knows how to flaunt its style, which I might have expected from a film called \"The Blues Brothers\". Speaking of that, the film's musical style is a whimsical combination of old blues and R&B, which works well with the film's atmosphere. For me, the best part of the film is its final scenes, which all add up to one truly zany spectacle. If you're interested in seeing a movie that's different to anything else out there, I'd give this movie a good look.",

The running joke that the Blues Brothers are invincible and don't react to any of their surroundings is hysterical and the destruction is expertly filmed. It did take a while to get going (partly because I could only find the extended edition), but it became a toe-tapping, good time by the end. The celebrity cameos are also great with a truly gut-busting moment from Ray Charles, and a psychotic ex-wife hunting the boys down, played by Carrie Fisher! There are a few moments where the jokes don't hit and towards the end some cartoony moments come out of nowhere, but it's a fun time and definitely one of the better SNL-adaptations.",

This is an excellent comedy that is brilliantly acted and directed and it has many memorable moments that standout. The pairing of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi is terrific, and they have great chemistry. The film blends well thought out comedy with an entertaining musical numbers that are far better than any other musical film that I have seen. I must confess I never was the biggest fan of musicals, I found them to be average at best, entertaining depending on what was written in the script, but never anything memorable either. With the Blues Brothers, it's quite different, there are enough moments of dialogue here to compliment the musical numbers, and it makes for a truly engaging film that is entertaining from start to finish.  I really enjoyed the film, it was a finely executed blend of comedy and music and it has to rank among one of the finest genre films ever made. The script is solid, and thoroughly entertaining, and the viewer is sucked into its humorous and memorable plot that is elevated by Aykroyd's and Belushi screen chemistry. Something simple goes a long way, and in the case of this film, it proves exactly right. The Blues Brothers in terms of story is nothing elaborate, but where it stands out, are the performances by its leads. The chemistry between the two lead actors is what elevates the simple plot to greatness and it's a fun; entertaining picture that in the long run is a memorable piece of comedy. The Blues Brothers is a must see film, a terrific performance by Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi , of which Belushi delivers a highly memorable performance, one that defined his sadly too short career.",

With all of the over-the-top car chases, ominous nuns, and clever quips in this film, there are also some absolutely fantastic musical cameos from the likes of Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and Cab Calloway. Aykroyd and Belushi are a hilarious team in this flick, and the persona that they put on with these well-dressed, fedora-donning singers is perfect. I don't think that Aykroyd's character removes his sunglasses for the entire film, and we only see Belushi's character do so for a particularly interesting scene near the end. We don't end up knowing much about these characters, and that's exactly the way that this movie is supposed to be executed; they are supposed to remain a bit mysterious. The movie's ridiculous tone gives itself a hand, as this allows some of the most ludicrous things in the movie, such as how a nun can close a door without touching it or how a car can land the jumps that these two do, to be forgiven by the phrase, \"Hey, it's a comedy.\" My only complaint with this movie is that the chase scene through Chicago City Hall at the end goes on a bit long for an already long movie, and doesn't contain either laughs or music, this film's strong suit. This didn't distract from how fantastic this film was, however, and I would watch it again anytime.",
