It is a masterpiece of sci-fi fantasy that transcends its genre and appeals to audiences of all ages. However, I also think that some aspects of the film are slightly flawed, such as the pacing, the dialogue, and the continuity. The film also leaves some questions unanswered and some plot threads unresolved that were later addressed or changed by the prequels and sequels. Nevertheless, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a thrilling and satisfying adventure that stands the test of time.",

I don't think I need to say how amazing Darth Vader is in this film, how Yoda rivals Oogway in his wise teachings, or how amazing the Bad Lip Reading video is for this, but I'll say it anyway. The action scenes are all fast and fluent, and the settings are phenomenal, arguably better than any other film in the franchise. Lando Calrissian is a wonderful addition to the cast, and Chewbacca, of all characters, gets better. Hans Solo and Leia's love story made my heart die, I have nothing to add to that. While this film is 5 stars, it's not perfect. There are no mistakes in this film, merely improvements that can be made. I don't think any film can be perfect, I mean, some got close (Whiplash, the Incredibles, Tale of the Princess Kaguya, etc.) but this might be a perfect sequel. It expands upon the universe, develops the characters to our liking, and progresses the story fluently and reasonably. This is on par with sequels like Shrek 2, Paddington 2, and others. I implore all ages, both young and old, to experience this masterpiece, then you will have inner peace. Also... Seagulls, STOP IT NOW!",

Action, I love the action really perfect and I love it so much because its just perfect no one can really say anything different and for the time, 80s, it's perfect. Acting is always prefect in Star Wars. CGI for the time the CGI is perfect. Villain, I said this before and I'll say it again Vader is one of the greatest villain of all time a lot of villains across all franchises are great but Vader is in top 3 in my opinion. Writing, it's really hard to tell which writing is better Episode IV or Episode V. Story, is perfect I think that it comes very close to the story of the 4th Episode. Casting is without a doubt perfect. Characters are also perfect. Adventure is perfect for the whole original trilogy. Mystery, I think that the mystery was best at the especially at the end because Vader cut off Luke's hand and then a few minutes later the movie ends and it really go me to wonder \"What happens next\" and \"there has to be another one\".",

This sequel creates texture and sophistication in its relationship dynamics, while enticing us to learn the personalities of these mystic new worlds aswell as those who inhabit them. \nThe climatic battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in its sparsely lit, smokey lair exudes spectacle brilliance as much as it enthralls emotionally in its culminating revelation. \n\nOverall The Empire Strikes Back is a fine example of how to bring intricacy and involvement to a seemly naive fairy tale adventure.",

Unlike what Rian Johnson and people who love TLJ and hate anyone who dislikes it are trying to say, this movie and its reception revolutionised cinema. The development of Luke is huge, having his ass handed to him by Vader, showing us that shit can happen in these movies. It ends on a phenomenal cliffhanger, potentially the first huge movie to do this. Every character from IV is given a brilliant low point. Luke loses his hand, finding out about his parentage in one of the most iconic scenes in the history of... well... ever. Leia loses the man she loves, just after she realises it. Han ends up in carbonite, his past dealings catching up with him after he sacrifices the opportunities to atone for them to help his friends. Chewbacca loses his closes friend. Even Vader, with the new context, has discovered that, despite apparently killing Padme in his anger, she was able to deliver a child. That must shatter his world view, making him question every decision he's made. This movie is iconic. From Vader's reveal to the battle of Hoth to Yoda and his theme. The fact that this is likely the standout movie of a year which included The Shining, Superman II, Flash Gordon and Caddyshack shows how brilliant this movie is.

Everything about this movie is incredible.\n\nThe film's tone is dark and oppressive, with a certain dread as the Empire keeps trying to find Luke. But that makes it all the more special with the few moments, such as the scenes with Yoda, where we're not constantly on our feet. They feel so whimsical and wonderful and have this beautiful sense of magic.\n\nThe music is the best part of this movie. John Williams captures the film's sense with just music alone spectacularly. It elevates the scenes and makes them way better, like with the asteroid field sequence or the Hoth battle. My favourite leitmotif is Han and Leia's love theme, with every use of it giving me chills. This is also the film with the first appearance of the Imperial March, one of the most iconic things in all Star Wars. It all culminates in a score that perfectly reflects the film.\n\nEverything I love about this film contributes to my favourite scene in Star Wars; the carbonite freezing scene. The intensity of the music and the tone of the entire movie is turned up to the absolute max. It is hands down the best part.\n\nI deeply respect the exceptional fx artists at I.L.M (Industrial Light and Magic) for helping bring this masterpiece to life. The visual effects are astonishing. The use of practical effects and models, and puppets look better than movies today in some cases.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie is not perfect. I'm not too fond of a few places, but no matter what, this movie is my favourite movie of all time, a masterpiece that I highly recommend.",

The planets of Hoth and Dagobah are vast and really add to the Star Wars universe and make for excellent settings. The characters we grew to love in the original Star Wars are developed more and we are introduced to Yoda and see the Emperor more as well. The emotions of both the characters and viewers involved are at much higher levels in \"The Empire Strikes Back\". In many ways it's darker and more menacing in it's antagonists ambitions and overall feel of the film. All in all, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is an amazing experience and in many ways superior to the rest. In my humble opinion, it is the greatest Star Wars of all and that is saying something.",

Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Faith in The Force and stargazing romance in Star Wars' galactic scale return!\n\nDirector Irvin Kershner's epic space opera The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is a daring project that expands the world of the Jedi and the Sith. Kershner delivers an enthralling movie and immaculately crafted film. The Empire Strikes Back is equal in intriguing majesty as George Lucas' 1977 cinema classic Star Wars, debatably a sequel that's superior to the original. Kershner's direction sees atmospheric shots of dense fog on Dagobah, snowy mist on Hoth, and eerie steam in Cloud City on Bespin. He obscures all the visual effects and practical sets for a haunting feel that invites you to look closer. Irvin Kershner's stellar direction elevates George Lucas' lo-fi style for Star Wars, ensuring The Empire Strikes Back is a dazzling return for audiences for generations to come.\n\nI'm glad producers George Lucas, Gary Kurtz, and Rick McCallum got Irvin Kershner to direct The Empire Strikes Back, while Lucas came up with a dazzling new story. Kershner brings real style and atmosphere, while Lucas' narrative gets all the more complex and ambitious. Portraying new planets, characters, and technology in seconds from Imperial scanning probes to Luke's cybernetic hand, The Empire Strikes Back breaks new ground effortlessly. \n\nGeorge Lucas' story adds a father and son element with his phenomenal twist that Darth Vader is actually Luke Skywalker's father. Having the fleeing rebels defeated, Lucas gives grace and time for each of his heroes. Han and Leia's romance subplot getting developed is very sweet. His high concept sci-fi ideas about The Force from Vader and Yoda communicating with Luke mentally are brilliant. Hearing the screenplay from Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan is astonishing. Especially their speech for Yoda to implore upon Luke the urgency that he must be patient, believe in The Force and in himself, is stunning writing. Master Yoda is quaint as he's clinging to Luke's back during Luke's Jedi training. Hearing Frank Oz spouting Jedi wisdom about The Force's power and a Jedi's patient resolve is absorbing.\n\nMark Hamill embodies Star Wars' Jedi hero Luke Skywalker like no other actor ever could. He's endearing with his impatience and earnest love for his friends. Him facing Vader in the cave with such curiosity and caution, seeing Yoda raise his ship with pure wonder and amazement are inspired moments. Luke feels like a hopeful hero as a Jedi in training with a real desire to learn from Yoda. Hamill convinces you of Luke's piloting prowess, sense of wonder, and bravery in facing down Darth Vader and learning a grave lesson. I love when Hamill looks agonized and then forlorn wondering why Ben Kenobi did not tell him about Darth Vader's true identity. Mark Hamill was simply born to portray Luke Skywalker and The Empire Strikes Back allows Hamill to depict Luke as a complex young man with dreams and flaws alike in gripping emotional realism.\n\nMark Hamill's fierce swordplay during Darth Vader versus Luke Skywalker's intense lightsaber duel on Cloud City is exhilarating. Hamill is moving fast in refined motions of desperate defiance against David Prowse in full swing as a terrifyingly brutal Darth Vader hacking away at every pipe and machinery in sight. Prowse finally goes from commanding screen presence to a true Sith Lord as Darth Vader has real gravitas in his imposing steps and lunges. James Earl Jones' iconic deep voice for Darth Vader has real emotion and fearsome presence all its own alongside Vader's constant pained breaths.\n\nHarrison Ford is hilarious as Han Solo with his sudden sarcastic quips and natural charm. Ford is charming as ever with sheer charisma and chaotic energy as Star Wars' romantic hero, the smuggler pilot Han Solo. His insecurities over Princess Leia liking Luke over him and not admitting her feelings for him are romantic and fun. It's an incredibly touching moment when Harrison delivers Han's simple reply \"I know\" for when Carrie finally admits to the audience that Leia loves Han. Carrie Fisher is commanding as a rebel leader and endearing as the sweet and nurturing heroine Princess Leia. Fisher is breathtakingly gorgeous with a tender sweetness to Leia this time as she opens up to Han more now. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher had real romantic chemistry together on the silver screen. She's a cool fighter and a useful voice in Han's erratic tactics since he never listens to C-3PO. \n\nBilly Dee Williams' Lando Calrissian is a neat addition to Star Wars' universe in The Empire Strikes Back. His easy going attitude betrays his darker intentions as he's somehow suave and sleazy at the same time. You immediately suspect something being wrong with Williams' Lando. He's overly welcoming, yet almost threatening to Han and Leia. Anthony Daniels is a riot as the ever complaining protocol droid C-3PO, who only thinks of his own survival chances. Yet, he's a devout believer in Luke, and seeks to protect his friends. C-3PO is more than comedy relief this time with a nice loyal character development. Peter Mayhew is delightful as the ferocious and loyal Chewbacca. Kenny Baker's R2-D2 is the cutest character and surprisingly expressive with his playful movements and excitable beeps and sad boops.\n\nFrank Oz is phenomenal as Jedi Master Yoda. The puppet Yoda looks incredibly real and moves with an old man's troubled walking limp and yet, Yoda also has unreal energy and humor to his performance. Oz gives Yoda an instantly iconic voice to deliver George Lucas' beautiful ruminations on The Force as a galactic life force more than a mere energy source of power for Jedi and Sith. Frank Oz is hilarious, wise, playful, mischievous, ominous, and encouraging as Yoda. Lucas' hideous CGI Yoda will compare to this adorable puppet Yoda that's so lovable and alive. Alec Guinness is sincere and encouraging of Luke once again as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, now a Force Ghost. I like how Guinness keeps Ben Kenobi's charming and serious delivery, so that Luke feels supported by Obi-Wan at every turn.\n\nEditor Paul Hirsch blasts through the Hoth battle with rapid fire cuts, then slows things down for the serious dramatic Jedi training with Yoda on Dagobah, then speeds things up for the action in Cloud City on Bespin. Hirsch's slick editing keeps The Empire Strikes Back at a succinct and fastly paced 124 minutes. I love how he splices together sequences of Luke training with Yoda alongside Han and Leia's adventures. All the compiled shots of space's stars are dazzling with each new planet introduced. The effects shots are cut between real actors, so they never look fake even decades later. \n\nI adore cinematographer Peter Suschitzky's medium shots with Darth Vader's jet black helmet in frame as he gazes out at space. Every wide shot of a new planet or spatial vista is breathtaking. His close-ups on Luke and Yoda as they discuss The Force as hypnotizing. All the wide shots of Vader in the steam filled darkness of the carbon freezing chamber are legendary for their atmosphere and sinister ambiance. The close-ups on Leia and Han as he's frozen are heartbreaking and simultaneously romantic.\n\nNorman Reynolds' immaculate production creates sets that just look real regardless of the space environments. Reynolds creates a harsh frosty environment for Hoth, sleek white hallways adorned in light for Cloud City, spooky interior machinery, and the best swamp sets ever made for Yoda's muddy planet Dagobah. Art direction from artists Leslie Dilley, Alan Tomkins, and Harry Lange is devastatingly beautiful. They paint beautiful fog, smoke, and mist everywhere to imagine the visual aesthetic of The Empire Strikes Back. They illustrate a frost covered rebel base on the wintery planet of Hoth to a floating Cloud City on Bespin in warm haloed light. The matte paintings in the backdrop of wide shots remain some of the nicest illustrations ever put to film.\n\nMichael Ford's set decoration is delightfully detailed to mind boggling levels. Ford's starfighter command panels on The Millennium Falcon, Darth Vader's all black recovery chair on the Imperial Star Destroyer, knick-knacks around Yoda's hut, to the rebel base display panels and Luke's camping gear. All the snakes and lizards on Dagobah help create an unsettling and creepy atmosphere.\n\nVisual effects artists Richard Edlund and Ralph McQuarrie bring Star Wars to life truly. From the mini models of AT-AT's walking realistically on Hoth to the stunning asteroid field in a starlit space, The Empire Strikes Back looks incredible. Yoda's puppet is one of cinema's greatest practical effects in hindsight. Luke using The Force to levitate stones, then Yoda raising up Luke's X-Wing starship is simply movie magic. Yoda's inspiring speech about the natural majesty of The Force is George Lucas' most thoughtful writing and one of cinema's greatest moments. Alec Guinness' visage covered in blue light to return as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the form of a Force Ghost still looks outstanding. Of course Luke's blazing blue lightsaber clashing against Darth Vader's searing red blade is dazzling.\n\nComposer John Williams' score is breathtaking for The Empires Strikes Back. Williams' romantic theme for Han and Leia is dreamy. His exciting Hoth battle music ramps up tension. His fearless score for Luke Skywalker versus Darth Vader's Cloud City duel to scoring the magical scene for Yoda levitating Luke's ship with his profound display of faith in The Force.\n\nSound designers Ben Burtt, Bonnie Koehler, Gregg Landaker, Gary Summers, and Richard Burrow ensure R2-D2's expressive beeps and boops give Luke's lovable little droid a fun personality. Their loud thumping footsteps of the AT-AT's to the sweeping jet engine roars of The Millennium Falcon adds a level of believability for the viewer. John Mollo and Tiny Nicholls' costumes have a stylish flair with Luke's new jacket like Han's. Carrie Fisher gets fresh rebel armor and pretty dresses for Leia. I love that make-up artists Stuart Freeborn, Rick Baker, Nick Maley, Graham Freeborn, and Kay Freeborn gave Leia a pretty haircut put back with her lovely braids weaved into her haircut. Darth Vader's flicker of facial scars on his unearthly pale skin to Luke's worn looks this time around to appear less naive than in A New Hope. You can visually see how Luke loses at the end.\n\nIn all, The Empire Strikes Back is the sequel to end all sequels with a grand message, clever writing, majestic scenery, thrilling action, endearing acting, funny jokes, lovable romantic, and unfathomable craftsmanship from the entire crew.",

Like Sgt Pepper, the film has clearly dated over the decades, but there are moments of beauty and spectacle and drama that still outclass anything that has followed. The big reveal counts as one of the greatest moments in cinema, and the Battle of Hoth is still one of the best battle scenes of any genre. The fact that a kids space adventure film from 40 years ago still makes it into the IMDB top 20 says everything you need to know.",

Luke Skywalker sets off to continue his Jedi training, while Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3PO are running from the Empire.\n\nThis is in my opinion the best Star Wars film ever, and one of the best films ever. They take what I consider to be a 10/10 movie in \"A New Hope\" and take it a step further with great character development, intense action, and improved visuals.\n\nFirst and Foremost across the board great acting. Everyone is on top of their game and gives their best possible performance.\n\nWe get to see Luke begin his training with Yoda. Yoda is easily one of my favourite Star Wars characters and I love every scene he is in. When Luke finds out that Han and Leia are in trouble he makes the hard decision to save them and face Vader without having finished his training. This of course leads to the iconic reveal that Darth Vader is Luke's father. That moment is one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, everyone watching Star Wars for the first time is surprised by that reveal.\n\nHan, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO provide us with some sweet action sequences when they are being chased by the empire. They also lead us to the introduction of Lando Calrissian, who is an old friend of Hans. \n\nThe score by John Williams is just as iconic as before and the new and improved visuals make for an even more immersive experience.\n\nThis is one of the greatest movies ever made and the fact that they were able to take what was already a phenomenal film and make it better is insanely impressive.\n\n10/10",

Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I went into this film expecting the best of the original trilogy. Weirdly enough I enjoyed a new hope more but only by a sliver. I struggle to wonder what took this film down a slight peg for me as it was still enjoyable and it even had better effects. I think that the things that took me out of this film cannot be held against the film but the overall narrative of Star Wars. The film makes a few things clear. Number one is that Yoda is supposed to have trained all the Jedi except Luke's father whom Obi Wan thought he could train. The other is that if you line up the storylines with the dialogue both Obi and Yoda are actively manipulating Luke into wanting to become a Jedi to \"restore balance\" to the galaxy. Now I know way too much about Star Wars and it's clear the galaxy has never been balanced. During the prequels the Jedi Order flourished in its numbers while the Sith were believed to be extinct. Once their presence became felt \"balance\" was thrown off. If the force were truly balanced both the Jedi and Sith could coexist in a constant conflict to tip the scales. But it will never be balanced because one will always gain advantage over the other. So this terminology is extremely misleading and I found myself questioning Yoda and Obi Wan for taking advantage of Luke's naivety. Now it's clear that Lucas had no overarching vision for his popular creation so it's not to the movies fault but the way things played out however it makes these characters less likable and as someone who out of all of Star Wars holds the shows in a higher regard specifically the clones wars. It really makes me feel like I am not watching the characters I know and love. But despite that it is fascinating to witness Lucas's original presentation of the force and the Jedi and Luke's arc in gaining these principles and skills through Yoda whom he grows to respect and put his faith in is intriguing. The trials he faces are mysterious but not in a confusing way. Yoda teaches him that his preconceived ideas of reality must be shattered for him to truly utilize the force as well as learn to block out distractions and gain focus. He also learns to trust his feelings but to be careful in letting them guide his actions as they can be taken advantage of and to never strike in anger or hatred. Never to let negative emotions guide him or his actions or else he will not be destroying just his enemies but himself as well. It's quite profound and well done. The film also opened with a big action scene that served as a set up for everyone's arcs but also a way to start off the movie in an exciting way as we enter the battle of hoth before toning things back down to focus on Luke's training and Han and Leias quest to fix the Falcons broken hyperdrive. This also serves as a way to both set up Han and Leias romantic tension and put them in danger so as to lure Luke into his confrontation with Vader. The handling of Han and Leias romance is questionable and somewhat confusing. From what I could gather Leia does not want to admit she has feelings for Han and Han wants her to admit her feelings without revealing his, making them both frustrated as the tension continues to build. It eventually culminates into its emotional climax when Han is put in a situation where he may die and Leia admits she loves him to which he responds with \"I know\" which I found odd and kinda rude as it could very well have been his last words. But luckily the third film makes this scene a little bit cute and less like it came out of the mouth of a heartless womanizer. I also will say that despite it being one of the best twists of all time and an impressive fight scene with high stakes and danger it really takes the punch out of the twist when every five year old boy and their grandma knows the scene whether or not they have seen it. Despite that they tease Leia as Luke's sister in a way that actually feels planned. Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi feel like the same coin, just different heads and for me much like Infinity War and Endgame the final conclusion is always more satisfying when done right. Lando was also a great addition to the trilogy and you can't help but feel bad for him as he loses everything he built and tries his best to make good decisions in a bad situation. He was probably my favorite character of the movie. The whole movie has great amounts of scope and visual creativity and its cliffhanger ending was well crafted if only it didn't feel so awkward in its own franchise due to its ever growing lore and stories. Despite that it's one of the most iconic films ever made and it's quite a ride from start to finish but for me somehow it ended up being the weakest and least enjoyable of its trilogy. Still legendary and I mean no disrespect but that's just my opinion.",

            "content": "Irvin Kershner's \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is an ambitious, heartfelt and soulful sci-fi classic that stands the test of time as crowning jewel of the Star Wars franchise. With the second Star Wars film, Kershner took the series in a dark direction by expanding on the timeless themes of the original. Using spellbinding cinematography, Kershner draws viewers into an apprentice's journey towards conquering his invasive enemy in a far-away galaxy. Kershner's decision to employ practical effects over CGI to recreate cartoonish characters pays off tremendously. It lends authenticity and realism to the movie's motion-capture characters missing from recent entries in the franchise. Kershner showcases extraordinary control over production design, action sequences and score, using these elements to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Lawrence Kasdan's screenplay is also superb, and expertly utilizes cross-cutting storytelling to convey a Jedi's quest towards glory. It's hard to not admire phenomenal performances. Mark Hamill delivers one of his greatest career performances as Luke Skywalker. With spellbinding expressions, he conveys determination, heroism and parental regrets of a novice jedi that struggles to come to terms with his mysterious ancestry. Harrison Ford is equally fantastic in the role of a suave smuggler that relies on wits to outsmart enemies in the galaxy. Ford brings undeniably stylish swagger to one of his most iconic roles that turned him into a star. The final, most noteworthy standout in the cast is James Earl Jones.  As the menacing Sith Lord Darth Vader, he brings shades of sympathy to one of the most reprehensible movie villains. Besides technical aspects, the final component of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" that contributes to its success is its message. Unlike other films in the franchise, the movie tackles emotional themes of destiny, legacy and parental regrets that make it the most meaningful Star Wars movie. Nearly 40 years after its release, it remains a sparkling lightsaber whose force inspires movie-goers to trek across galaxies in soaring millenium falcons even if shocking secrets about father figure enemies are written in their phantom of menace destinies.",

            "content": "The pacing of the middle chunk of this movie is slow; it's deliberate but certainly a bit of a drag when rewatching this movie from time to time.  And there -- I've just done the impossible:  I just worked out the one genuine grievance I can give to this movie.  Beyond that, The Empire Strikes Back is rightfully cemented in the categories of Best Action Movie Ever, Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever, and Best Sequel Ever, as this movie is, beyond my grievance above, about as close to Cinematic Perfection as we may ever see.  It explores the hidden depths of A New Hope and actually builds upon it with material that is even more interesting and engaging than in the first movie, and throw in that this is the Second Act movie, where the heroes are at their lowest, this movie features some emotional gut-punches that the first movie simply does not have.  While the first movie made Darth Vader a memorable and intimidating villain, this movie escalates him to being possibly the single greatest Movie Villain of all time, as he is not only immensely powerful, he is shown to be smarter and more unrelenting than we (the audience) previously thought.  Along with that, the Empire is shown to be more effective than they appeared in the first movie, with the AT-ATs being one of the most memorable Sci-Fi Action creations ever, even if they are a bit impractical.  The main thing is that this movie genuinely ramps up the tension of almost every situation because you truly believe, more than in the first movie, that the heroes are often times in genuine danger.  This makes the final action sequence the most intense, despite the fact that it's actually the least complex in regards to execution.  On that note, the two big setpieces:  the Battle on Hoth and the Asteroid Chase, are both absolutely stellar, pun intended, making EXCELLENT use of this sequel's increased budget, alongside some excellent action design.  And perhaps the biggest accomplishment of all is that this movie features genuinely impactful emotional beats at the end, with what is easily one of Cinema's greatest twists of all time, and ends on a note of genuine hope, despite an ever-increasing somber and dire tone.  It's considered a masterpiece by many because it is a masterpiece, and for what it does, there are almost no other movies in existence that does it as good, let alone better.",

Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back does everything its predecessor did and so much more. If we go by the criteria of what makes a good sequel, it passes with flying colours. It expands the universe of the original in new and meaningful ways by introducing fresh new planets like Hoth and Bespin and some of the best characters in the entire franchise: Lando, Yoda, Boba Fett and of course Palpatine. It continues the story of the original by taking the next logical step, having Luke face off with Darth Vader and making their dynamic and conflict even more interesting by revealing that they're related. It expands on the themes of the original by showing what the Light and Dark side truly represent and how they differ. And finally, it undoubtedly leaves a positive impact on the franchise by being a masterpiece and being at the center of everything that has yet to come. For how this movie stands on its own, it's magnificent, Luke, Leia and Han all go through excellent arcs and all learn from their mistakes in a way that is interesting and compelling to watch. Darth Vader still has the same presence he had in A New Hope and they set up his return to the light extremely well by having someone more evil than him, making his eventual turn more realistic. The action sequences were a delight to watch, from the battle of Hoth, to the final fight between Luke and Vader, you can't help but marvel at the splendor you're experiencing. The special effects they used were revolutionary, from the usage of paintings to create large, beautiful landscapes to the puppeteering done by Frank Oz, all of it has aged like fine wine. The acting has improved drastically from the original, Mark Hamill is much more likeable as Luke Skywalker and Harrison Ford is more sympathetic but still maintains that hint of contumacious. The chemistry our main trio shared in the original transfers over to the sequel flawlessly, it's even more fun to watch them bicker and argue this time around. Last but not least, this movie's highest of highs is its climax. The fight between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, while not the flashiest fight in the franchise, manages to deliver on a tense fight that holds an immense amount of dramatic weight. Han Solo freezing in carbonite was also something no other movie dared to do at the time, having the heroes lose the battle and have one of the heroes seemingly die was extraordinary and wasn't just there for shock factor as it weaves itself seamlessly into the grander picture. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back isn't just a movie, its George Lucas' magnum opus. It truly is the grandmaster of the franchise!",

With its predecessor Star Wars being instantly recognised as a watershed movie and an absolute classic, a follow up film was always going to have gigantic cinematic shoes to fill. Thankfully, new director Irvin Kershner does a marvellous job with Lucas' new story, and the talented team at ILM perform their magic once again to help bring the world of Star Wars back to life. All the cast are reunited in this film, which would not have been nearly as good if any of them had declined to return. The Empire Strikes Back is story evolution, not a repeat of old material or a re-telling of the same story, which is what you get in so many inferior movie sequels. The film's opening sequences firmly establish the two key story arcs in Star Wars - Luke's journey to becoming a Jedi, as well as his relationship to Darth Vader, and Leia's emerging relationship with Han Solo. What follows is high adventure, taking us to incredible new places and introducing fantastic new characters from the Star Wars universe, culminating in another epic fight scene with Darth Vader, but this time against the enthusiastic young Luke Skywalker. The sets, special effects, miniature model work, props and costumes are all faultless, and Frank Oz's puppetry work with Yoda is first rate. John William's masterpiece score shines through again, perfectly encapsulating the mood of each scene. Personally, I much prefer the original theatrical version compared to the modern Lucas cut with added CGI features. It is no surprise that Empire Strikes Back tops the list for many moviegoers, as either the best Star Wats film or even the best film ever.",

            "content": "Just before the release of Rise of the Skywalker, I had decided to watch every single Star Wars movie so that I could finally understand the memes and also catch up on time. So as I watched The Empire Strikes Back, I was actually really disappointed. Because of how much people speak about it, I was expecting it to be something more than that. But as I grew up, I started appreciating it more and more. Why I hated it earlier and why I like it now, I'll explain it further in the review.\n\nBack when I saw this movie for the first time, I was getting more and more surprised at every scene. I had heard about all the characters like Yoda, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO etc, but I didn't know what was their deal. I did know Yoda was a green guy who was very skilled, but I didn't know anything else about him. This is the reason why I liked his introduction so much. The problem was, however, that I already knew he was Yoda. So all that acting, I wasn't going to buy it.\n\nSimilarly the Darth Vader scene was a huge bummer. The way people used to describe it was as if he removes his mask and says it with an emotional background music. But instead he just simply speaks it out in a claustrophobic environment, with the background music completely quenching the impact. It was in no way as good as everyone described it. I might have liked the scene if I didn't already know about it, which basically shows how this movie suffered from the success it received.\n\nThe camera quality has also aged very poorly. I don't know why, but somehow I just can't watch old movies. I get bored and start feeling sleepy very quickly. It happened as I watched Episode IV, it happened as I watched Superman and it happened as I watched The Godfather. I actually slept at the part where Luke is training on Yoda's planet. This is the first movie ever that I watched in two different days. Once as I slept and once after I woke up the next day. And somehow it left such an impact that even today I feel sleepy whenever I watch any Star Wars movie.\n\nWith all the bad things said, now let's move on to why I like this movie now. First of all the whole idea of a space opera is so awesome. I have always been very much into astronomy since I was a kid so an entire movie series made around this is something like a dream for me. I can imagine this could also be true for many kids in the 60's and 70's. The CGI is quite awesome for the time. Like I said about the Darth Vader scene or the Yoda scene, they must have looked so cool when they were seen for the first time. The part where Han is embossed rises too much tension, since he's such a likeable character and now he's at stake. If George Lucas went by his multiple movies idea instead of a franchise then this could have been such an awesome take.\n\nI feel really mad at myself that I learnt about all the spoilers from this movie except for Han getting embossed. I wish I could rewatch this after having removed everything I know from my memory. This movie should be re-released in 4K HDR so that I don't fall asleep while watching it again. It is a pinnacle in the Star Wars series and I really hope the franchise can return back to this level.",

This movie took everything that was great about the first one to new heights - the special effects are seamless, the action is gripping, and new classic characters are introduced. Perhaps the greatest improvement comes from the acting and writing. Hamill, Ford, and Fisher have honed their skills and bring emotional depth to Luke, Han, and Leia that wasn't quite there in the last film. The three parallel subplots provide opportunities for each of these main characters, as well as antagonist Darth Vader, to have spotlight moments that do not go to waste. We get to know each of these characters, their aspirations, motivations, and fears, on an intimate level. These subplots weave back together in the final act that will blow viewers away on their first watch, and will continue to be deeply satisfying with every viewing afterwards. The filmmaking and characters have matured, but not without losing the excitement and adventure of the first film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' is Star Wars, Sci-Fi cinema, and block-buster filmmaking at its peaks.",

It's a very good-looking, impactful, and intense battle. A very intense scene with great sound effects. Within the first 10-35 minutes there is almost non-stop action, which I really liked. I was not the biggest fan of the first meeting between Yoda and Luke, for me, as someone who knew Yoda as this bad-ass Master he feels really weird in Strikes Back. One thing I thought of very often in the first hour or so is the relationship between Han and Leia, from watching this nowadays it feels super weird how Han \"approaches\" Leia, it felt very uncomfortable sometimes. As in any Star Wars review yet, I have to say the sound is once again a true masterpiece. Unfortunately, minute 45 to 65 bored the hell out of me and its one reason which cost the movie a possible better rating. Loved the way Darth Vader just casually kills people left front and center, really helped to connect this pure evil character to viewers. I liked the twist with the whole Lando, Boba situation. Did not expected that. Something that also irritates me was some cuts, they felt weird, possibly due to the age though. The \"I am your father\" scene is one of these cinema movies that will be memorized forever. R2D2 is just the true MVP of the Star Movies, no question. The last 30 minutes are just pure epicness and almost perfect cinema. Once again a really good Star Wars movie.",

This was something that didn't please many critics during its original release, as the sequel has a maturer approach of storytelling. We're given a much-needed darker tone, character depth, and some incredible emotional substance. As the Star Wars universe is expanded, we dive deep in to the story of Rebels vs The Empire. Everything from new locations, characters and ideas behind the Force are territories explored perfectly whilst still capturing the magic of the original.\n\nOver the past several decades The Empire Strikes Back has shown that it isn't just a great sequel, it is the ultimate sequel, with a vast number of series trying to copy the darkness and maturity. From films that immediately followed it such as Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan (1982), to current features including Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Critics and fans alike are constantly asking if sequels are \"the next Empire\". The Empire Strikes Back took everything that made Star Wars such an amazing experience and added so much more to the universe. It takes the series in to a more engaging direction, whilst adding depth and emotional substance, making it completely surpass the processor in every way. 40 years later, it continues to stand tall as one of the greatest sci-fi adventures and one of the best sequels ever made.",

I really like the fact that throughout this movie we get to see the difference in power between the Empire and the Rebellion. The Empire has almost unlimited resources since they are in control of a galaxy, while the rebellion only has the resources that the people supporting the Rebellion have.  I also like the fact that we see how it is one of the few Star Wars movies where the bad guys win (the other being Revenge of the Sith). While we now know the outcome of the story, when it first came out people didn't know what to expect for the future of the franchise. On the downside, in order to fully understand the movie, you have to watch Episode IV, and there is also the fact that the movie is kind of old, so new audiences might find it kind of boring. Still, I would rate this movie a 5 out of 5.",

Elsewhere, Billy Dee Williams and Frank Oz make for strong additions. There are, once again, fun roles for Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker.\n\nI'd say its predecessor has aged better - though that's not to say this film looks even the slightest bit bad, as it still looks fantastic throughout. The plot is as great as before, as is everything else really - namely the music, for one.\n\nI think I prefer the 1977 film over this, but there's barely anything separating the two in my thoughts to be honest.

Yoda is hilarious, and Darth Vader grows ever more sinister - espically with that icon I twist. The soundtrack is better than the first too, with the Imperial March, Asteroid Field and Yodas Theme all amazing. Every actor is on better form here than the 1st and 3rd chapters, and the Dark tone really bumps up the edge-of-your-seat tension. Near flawless, and one of my top favourite films. | Grade: A+",

Luke's development as a more mature, but still very imperfect Jedi-in training, Han and Leia's relationship turning from spiteful banter to genuine love, and Vader's obsession with finding the Millennium Falcon all provide the level of drama that far surpasses the first Star Wars movie, and any other Star Wars to date.

The set pieces are fantastic here and some of the graphics (especially the space flight) is impressive even for today's standards.

George Lucas brought his teacher, Mr Irvin Kershner, to direct the sequel to the big hit film of the summer of 1977, STAR WARS (later named A New Hope). When I saw this film, it was my 2nd favorite, but now it's in the #1 spot of any STAR WARS film (2nd is A New Hope formerly STAR WARS, and the 3rd Original Trilogy movie, Return of the Jedi, is 3rd on my list.) George Lucas continued the story he wanted to tell, and he delivered and it was positive. Sets were extraordinary in regards to the Special Editions (which didn't turn out well), and having Billy Dee Williams, who was an Icon in previous movies and the only black guy in the Star Wars universe, became more popular with Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. They ended the film in a spot where the audience could've known where they would be going next. The film also ends with the Millennium Falcon flying off to go find Boba Fett and Jabba the Hutt on another planet (which was known as Tattooine.) Other than the movie itself, it's got great music, SFX (sound effects), and great practical effects throughout the whole film. I would recommend for beginners of Star Wars, or you can watch them in order they go in (Phantom Menace to Rise of Skywalker) in a marathon.",

            "content": "Okay, the movie itself is the greatest film of all time, but I gave it three stars instead of five because of my experience at the theater, not because of the movie itself. \nI've been a fan of Star Wars since about 1991 or 1992 when I saw the OG trilogy on VHS. Then, when the 1997 Special Editions came out, I got the chance to see my favorite movies in theaters (except Empire Strikes Back...got grounded). Anyway, today was my first chance to see my favorite movie in theaters that I didn't get the chance to see when I was a kid. I bought three tickets so I wouldn't have annoying people sitting next to me distracting me from the movie, and had the spot in the center of the back row, usually the best seat in the house. \nThen right before the movie begins this big ass family shows up (not socially distancing, BTW) and is in the row directly in front of me, and to my horror, they have a damn baby with them. What kind of inconsiderate douchebags bring a baby to a theater? I can understand bringing a baby to a cartoon Disney movie geared for small children, but to Empire Strikes Back? Really? Anyway, the entire time people in that group keep getting up and coming back in to the theater causing a huge distraction, and they didn't even bother ducking down to prevent obscuring the screen, and they keep passing their baby back and forth and do they keep the kid low to prevent it from getting in the way of the screen? No. They lift it up. They did the same thing with their popcorn buckets. So many distractions from one group. VERY annoying. Then about halfway through the movie, their baby who had already been making sounds throughout the movie starts crying. Do they remove the baby? Yeah, sure, for a few minutes, but they come back in with it and sit at one of the seats by the door where it proceeds to start crying AGAIN. This happened twice more throughout the movie. Anyway, if you have a baby, get a damn babysitter, or don't go to the movies at all, especially at night-that child should have been in bed anyway. Also, if you have to use the bathroom, or get more popcorn or soda, especially if you are in a large group, do so before or after the movie, otherwise, you are disturbing others who paid good money to see the movie. \nAnyway, theaters really should have a no children under 5 policy for any movie that isn't rated G, and should have a no re-entry policy once the movie starts. \nAnyway, on top of that, I ordered a large popcorn and large soda, and made sure to ask if larges were still refillable, and they said they were, but they weren't allowed to refill the same container anymore (and they blamed in on covid-that excuse is getting seriously tired when businesses do stuff to cut costs) and that the refill containers for the soda and popcorn are mediums when it used to be that they would refill as a large. I wouldn't normally have a problem with that, except they didn't lower the price at all, even though you are getting less and even with a refill they overcharge you. Anyway, I got the popcorn and soda anyway because I rarely go to theaters anyway, so when I do go, I want the full experience. Soooo, once the movie is over, as I usually do when I go to the theater, I go to the snackbar to get the refills I paid for, and it turns out they threw all the popcorn away. I'm not too mad about the popcorn thing because I was able to get a pass for another movie as a result, but why would you throw the popcorn away when there are still customers in the building? Wait until you close. It's not that difficult. \nThe only reason I gave three stars is because A) Empire Strikes Back is the best movie of all time, and even inconsiderate jackasses and mismanaged theaters can't completely ruin it, and B) because they tried to make it right with the popcorn issue by giving a pass for a future movie. If this was any other movie, it likely would have been a one star review. My first time seeing ESB in theaters is forever tainted because of this.",

C Minus.. movie is very complicated,, why brother.\n\nThe New Mutants... C   At least you know what this movie is about,, its about new Mutants... thats a clever title..  But I liked this movie more than Tenant.. it got a thumbs down at Rotten-tomatoes.\n\nThe Heartbreak Club... C plus.. Funny chick movie..  but ok it dragged had a few laughs and was cute. Guys take your girl to see this movie..  you will get bonus points.. or a wife. \n\nUnhinged.. D minus    the Greatest Actor of all time,,And he settles for this? Anyone watch Gladiator.. Russell Crow plays a fat Don Conners from Roseanne, and terrorized a young lady for not saying I am sorry during a road rage incident.  Great script.. what did you find this movie on the bathroom floor.. Clever movie plot and twist... I thought it was a 90 minute ad for a driving defense course.  \n\nAnd this is the third week of Regal opening up,, during C19.. I had no idea they would run these movies. Its like there is a 3.99 bin,, and nope lets go the 99 cent bin of movie. These names will be forgotten in one week..",

Appreciate it more as an adult. Want to thank George Lucas for taking us to a Galaxy far far away when we needed it most and the late Irvin Kershner for flawlessly directing the best installment by eons of the series and of course Thank You to the Master Composer John Williams himself for creating one of the most perfect and iconic movie scores in cinema history. This may be the last Star Wars film I get to see in a theater and most likely the last time I get to see Empire Strikes Back on the big screen assuming Im not here for the 50th. Happily The Rise of Skywalker is not my final Star Wars film on the big screen. If you have never seen this movie - double mask up, social distance and enjoy the ride. If you are old like me and have seen it 100 times, go now and see it for the 101st. It's worth it and will make you a kid again. Awesome and Amazing",

He's got some great quotes which are very inspirational and a lot of them are very memorable.\n\nThe love and hate relationship, which Han Solo and Princess Leia have got throughout this movie is honestly beautifully shown and it's very great.\n\nThe dialogue which is given from all the characters throughout this movie is all honestly great.\n\nThere's so many great comedy moments throughout this movie, either that being a scene where Han Solo and Leia are flirting with each other or it being a scene with Yoda, Luke and R2-D2 being hilarious.\n\nI even love how we get to see little sneak peaks to what Darth Vader looks like underneath the helmet throughout this movie, it's honestly brilliant.\n\nFinally, the pacing which this movie's got is honestly so good and it's so great for the build ups for certain moments.\n\nThe cinematography which was shot by Peter Suschitzky is honestly beautiful and he's done a beautiful job on capturing the scenes so well.\n\nThe score which was composed by the man, the myth and the legend John Williams is honestly so beautiful. It works so well with the scenes it's been placed with, he's honestly the best at composing some of the greatest scores for the greatest movies ever.\n\nThe action scenes are all honestly great, especially that last one, that one's got some beautiful choreography in it and the music which was composed by John Williams goes so well with it.\n\nOverall, The Empire Strikes Back is honestly a masterpiece and a half and it's the best Star Wars movie to this day. \n\nThe movie's got a brilliant plot, amazing acting from all the cast and it's even got some great dialogue from all of the characters. \n\nIt's even got some great humour which works very well, some very good pacing, some very inspirational and very funny quotes. There's even some beautiful cinematography, a beautiful soundtrack which was composed by the legend John Williams and some very great action scenes. \n\nI'd honestly recommend to watch this one straight after you've watched A New Hope, it's honestly worth the watch.",

Luke, Han, and Leia are separated as Luke is sent to go train to be a Jedi. He encounters a small creature who was once the Grand Master of the Jedi order. Han takes Leia to his ship during the rebel evacuation as he can't reach the transports. Then he discovers that the hyperdrive is broken and he can't travel through lightspeed so he has to evade the empire at all costs. Han and Leia then start building up their romance as they are called to Cloud City, where Han meets an old friend, who then betrays them to the empire. The empire then uses Han, Leia, 3P0, and Chewie as bait as they try to lure Luke in. Luke falls for the trap, leaving Yoda behind when he is warned that if he leaves he will have no help. He then promises to return to Daghoba to complete his training. He then flies to Cloud City. Vader is preparing for Luke's arrival as he wants to deliver Luke to the emperor. Vader then decides to carbon-freeze Luke, but he has to test in on Han. Han survives the freezing process and is then taken away by Boba Fett, a bounty hunter working for the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. When Luke arrives, he puts up a fight with Vader and manages to escape the freezing process and Vader. But this victory doesn't last for long as Vader finds Luke and continues the fight. Meanwhile, Lando (Han's Friend), Leia, Chewie, C-3P0, and R2-D2 are escaping cloud city on the Millenium Falcon. Suddenly, Vader and Luke find themselves fighting on an extension bridge and Vader is almost pushing Luke to the edge where Vader stops trying to kill Luke to reveal a shocking truth: Vader is Luke's father. Vader asks Luke to join him but Luke refuses, Vader cuts off Luke's hand and Luke jumps off the bridge. Luke falls down the drop at a high speed before landing in a tube that leads out to the radio antennas at the bottom of the floating cloud city. Luke reaches out with the force to Leia, asking her to come back and rescue him and Leia hears his plea for help. They turn the Falcon back around and pick up Luke. They then go and regroup with the rebel fleet and go to a medical frigate, where Luke is given a cybernetic hand. Then Luke and Leia speak to Lando on an open-comlink channel. Lando says how he is preparing to go and rescue Han on Tatooine at Jabba's palace and then they cut off the channel. Then Luke and Leia watch as the Millenium Falcon soars off into the distance. Then the camera pans across as a beautiful score (Han and Leia's Love Theme by John Williams) plays and the camera pans to the back of the fleet as they fly away into the distance. And, roll credits.\n\n\nThis is the best story of all time in my opinion and will continue to be forever.",

This movie takes the formula, emotional levels, and action of A New Hope and basically multiplied it all times 100 and got this movie. Everything about this movie was taken to the next next level after A New Hope. This movie shows that you don't always have to have the heroes win to make a good action movie. It's refreshing to see the heroes lose to remind us that they are still just normal people fighting for a cause greater than them. The only thing that bothered me a little bit in this movie was in the middle and end of act two; it got a little too boring for me. But if it wasn't as boring in the second act this movie would easily be a 5/5 for me. Other than that, however, this is the greatest Star Wars film that cannot and will not be beat.",

Darth Vader is pretty cool in this, and the Yoda scene was great. Luke is a tad bit annoying on the planet Dagobah, but other than that he's fine. There is a little bit of filler sometimes so to me it's not perfect. The Lightsaber duel in this movie is a large improvement over the last one and the fact that (spoilers) Luke doesn't win is good, since certain movies seem to make their main characters and whatnot overpowered. There is a good twist in this movie, unfortunately it's pretty much ruined for most people. The characters are fairly like-able, C-3PO is a bit annoying but he's supposed to be and is treated as such. For me this movie is a solid 8/10.",

When I saw that Empire would be playing in a theater near me this month, I jumped on the opportunity to see it on the big screen! And I was not disappointed. I didn't think I could love this film more than I already do, but seeing it in the way it was meant to be seen has made me fall in love with it all over again! I'm glad I purchased the ticket and there were only 2 other people in the theater with me, so there was no problem social distancing. I hope they do this for the other original trilogy Star Wars films at some point in th future, as I would definitely be interested in viewing them in the theater, just like Empire!

The dialogue is amazing, every character has developed since Star Wars in the greatest ways possible. Leia is still badass but is a more rounded out character in terms of emotion. Han is more badass and more compassionate at the same time. Contrary to public opinion the greatest quote in this movie is not delivered by Vader, it is delivered by Han on Hoth before he goes outside the Rebel Base, you know which one I mean. The cinematography is amazing and Irvin Kershner really proves that he could direct a blockbuster that has action and excitement but also great character arcs. Of course we cannot talk about Star Wars without talking about the score. John Williams took all the elements we loved from episode IV and improved upon it, something no one else thought was possible. Yoda's theme at Dagobah, the score during the Asteroid Field chase and of course the famous Imperial March. This movie is everything you want it to be and more. I find no faults in Empire Strikes Back. If you haven't already, watch it, it's a timeless classic.",

            "content": "Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is possibly one of the greatest sequels ever made. It is often touted as the best movie in the entire Star Wars franchise and has some of the most iconic moments in American Cinema history. It is also my favorite movie of all time. I hardly know where to begin with this movie, ESB is everything that Star Wars is and more. It takes the heightened storytelling medium that the original Star Wars exemplified and masterfully complicated it. When you make a sequel to a successful movie, it is often wanted that you will create something that brings the story forward and improves on the world. ESB is one of the greatest sequels because it not only knocks those goals out of the park, but it improves upon the formula so much, that further films would feel so much more like this movie than the original. Where Star Wars was simple, ESB is complicated. Where Star Wars was quick and dramatic, ESB is slower and more contemplative. Where the characters were more archetypical and static, ESB has so much development and change. It is a testament to how good ESB is that A New Hope, one of the greatest of all time, is not the best movie in the Star Wars series. Empire Strikes back has flaws of course, there are underutilized characters, and there are some problematic aspects of the main romance. But compared to the other movies in this series, especially the more recent ones, this movie is near perfect. John Williams's score perfectly accompanies the space opera aesthetic of the screenplays by the late Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. This movie perfectly encapsulates what a Star Wars movie should be. It is the best of the series and my personal favorite of all time. -Rhenn",

The scene where Darth Vader is talking to the Emperor is great and there is a lot of mystery and it makes you get really invested in the movie. Luke's training with Yoda is some of the best stuff ever in StarWars and Yoda is the best in this movie that he has been in any StarWars movie and that is the same for Darth Vader.  All of our characters(Han, Chewy and Leia are great. When C3PO loses his arms and legs it is funny and fun to watch when Chewbacca has to put him back together. When our heroes go-to the cloud city is a lot of fun and Han didn't know he was walking into a trap and Lando betrays him and you can feel it. When Luke fights Darth Vader, it is a great fight, the choreography is much better and the I am your father twist and Luke willing to die and losing his hand and Han being frozen in carbonite made a great Cliff Hanger. I also like Boba Fett and he had a lot of mystery and I was excited to see him in the next movie.  I don't have anything negative to say about this movie.\n\nI'm going to give this movie an (A+)",

This movie took everything that was great about the first one to new heights - the special effects are seamless, the action is gripping, and new classic characters are introduced. Perhaps the greatest improvement comes from the acting and writing. Hamill, Ford, and Fisher have honed their skills and bring emotional depth to Luke, Han, and Leia that wasn't quite there in the last film. The three parallel subplots provide opportunities for each of these main characters, as well as antagonist Darth Vader, to have spotlight moments that do not go to waste. We get to know each of these characters, their aspirations, motivations, and fears, on an intimate level. These subplots weave back together in the final act that will blow viewers away on their first watch, and will continue to be deeply satisfying with every viewing afterwards. The filmmaking and characters have matured, but not without losing the excitement and adventure of the first film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' is Star Wars, Sci-Fi cinema, and block-buster filmmaking at its peaks.",
