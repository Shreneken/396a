Although it is still good, that should easily be a 20 minute scene and nothing would be lost. However once they arrive in Vietnam the film floors it and includes one of the most intense, memorable and disturbing scenes I have ever seen. It easily makes up for the overlength of the first hour. Everything is brought home and the editing/pacing never make the same mistake of the first 50 minutes or so. Also everything is so technically brilliant throughout acting and cinematography wise along with the editing/music of the remaining 2 hours that you can easily forgive the mistakes of the first hour and that is saying ALOT. Everyone should give this a watch once.",

Out of five friends, three are selected for the Vietnam War; of those three, one dies by suicide, one is physically and emotionally maimed, and one is steadfast, though deeply impacted.  Might this represent the Baby Boom generation by percentage?  This was beautifully and artistically portrayed.  Further the ending commentary by way of the news reporter, laments this horrible history.  Yet, have we learned, and necessarily do we learn, nothing from this tragedy?  The cast of characters sing \"America the Beautiful\" on the fade out.  Is war ultimately beautiful but for the losses?  Recommend, but I'll never watch it again:  like throwing black paint on an otherwise beautiful canvass.",

            "content": "\"The Deer Hunter\" is an epic movie made up of three distinctive parts. The first hour concentrates on the small industrial town in Pennsylvania where a group of friends are gathering for a wedding. We get to know the characters, the steel works where they all work, their likes, their loves and their relationships with each other. Michael ( Robert De Nero ) plays a slightly unhinged character who is like the ring leader of the group of friends. Nick ( Christopher Walken ) is the happy go lucky character who loves his hometown, especially the woodlands surrounding the town. Steven ( John Savage ) is the young man with an overbearing mother who is getting married prior to enlistment and serving in Vietnam. Stan ( John Cazale ) is slightly on the fringes of the group, always there but not really as close as the rest of the friends and Axel ( Chuck Aspergen ) is the comedian of the group. This first act emphasises their standing within the town, the dynamics of the friends, their camaraderie and fun the characters have in their lives. The town is extremely patriotic and the three friends who have enlisted in the army are seen as hero's off to do their Country proud. The foreshadowing of things to come is evident by a returning serviceman who happens to wander into the wedding proceedings. His abrasive manner and complete lack of interaction is in stark contrast to the excitement and patriotism the friends display. \u00a0\n\nThe tone shifts dramatically when Michael , Nick and Steven are fighting in Vietnam, especially when the three of them are captured, tortured and forced to play Russian roulette. The focus very much switches to the battle to survive the horrors of war. This second act is more about the way the characters act under the pressures faced by the destruction, pain and suffering of war.\n\nThe final act sees the return of Michael to his hometown. Michael's personality has changed and is now somewhat distant but calmer as a result of his experiences during the war. Steven severely injured and disabled seems unable to face up to life back with his wife and young child. Steven's wife suffering from shock due to her husbands injuries also seems unable to function as before. Finally Nick, a changed man due to the trauma faced in captivity and suffering from PTSD, is still in Vietnam earning money from illegal gambling and participating in rounds of Russian roulette. Michael, feeling the emptiness of life created by his experiences in Vietnam is unable to settle at home knowing his friend is still in Vietnam. He returns to the war zone just as The Country is about to fall to try and persuade Nick to come home. Unfortunately Nick is too far gone mentally and ends up killing himself. The very moving ending sees the friends finally all reunited but unfortunately it is through trauma and death during the funeral of Nick.\u00a0\n\nThe music, the pacing, the acting and the cinematography are all spectacular and what ensues is a roller coaster of emotions for the viewer of this spectacle of a movie. \"The Deer Hunter,\" despite being over 44 years old, is still a powerful movie that is able to move audiences to extremes of emotion.",

Robert Deniro is good not amazing, Meryl Streep is wonderful as supporting, and then you have Christopher Walken who is just the best in this film understated performance.\n\nThe minimalism in the script and the sets works well some very somber moments. The mining town in most of the film is set in a great vivid backdrop.\n\nThe pacing kills me though so much time spent on weddings then a brief war segment then so little spent on reflection of those events. They hunt a deer too. It might be life seems to last in happy moments but that seems undo itself thematically. If they cut about thirty minutes and trimmed the wedding down this would a masterpiece as it stands it is a experimental drama from the seventies that is good but not great.",

There are some sobering and even poignant moments present but I'd say its more of a symbolic film, than an out right action drama type of a film. The best performances, in my opinion of course, were by Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. Its a film of two halves - the pre-'nam half and the other half post 'nam. Its bleak when you think about it towards the end, although I did find myself being a little surprised at the end, as I'd somehow expected there to have been more in the way of disturbing, bloody imagery. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad there wasn't as I don't much like that sort of thing but I suppose I had it in my head that this was going to be a very tough watch and I didn't entirely find it so - the previously mentioned roulette scenes do make for edgy viewing but I must have expected more somehow. The ending is pretty thoughtful and indeed it is somewhat thought provoking. Its really all about the toll that involvement in war (any war) can have on people - particularly, of course, a group of youngish, seemingly previously care free, people.\n\nIts a film of its time and it makes for relatively thoughtful viewing. Thats about all I can think to say about it really. Yes, I suppose I would recommend it, although it may not be as visually shocking as you may expect - films these days are a lot more explicit but this film still contains important themes.",

            "content": "There is a certain transcendence achieved in the hunting sequences of the film, arising from a serene and wholly isolated context that offers the perfect confluence of despairing alienation and comforting solitude. In such moments, the film achieves a truly operatic sweep which is ingeniously heightened through its uninhibited depictions of small town life, allotting a stunning amount of time to the daily affairs of its characters both before and after the war. An early wedding sequence is permitted to unfurl before us in what feels like real time, enrapturing us in its festive minutia to the extent that the story evolves into a wholly encompassing experience. Just as brilliantly, the war sequences are devastating and yet ephemeral, crafted in such a way as to allow the brevity of combat to cast its heavy, lingering pall over the remainder of the film. The film does, however, lose me in its segue into the underground world of profit-based Russian roulette, resulting in a palpable sacrifice of credibility that slightly diminishes the potency of its ambitiously tragic climax. Despite this shortcoming, \"The Deer Hunter\" functions beautifully as a kind of requiem for that which is left behind when emerging from the horrors of war, concluding with a strange and yet appropriately ambiguous passage that navigates the line between a proverbial sigh of despair and a half-hearted effort to push on.",

            "content": "I'm terribly sorry for giving such a mediocre rating to this film, but dear God was I fooled into thinking it would be good. The Deer Hunter is a palpable example of pure Oscar bait that is ultimately saved by some pretty strong second and third acts. The plot is extremely basic, and it's about the lives of some steel mill workers before being drafted into Vietnam and after their traumatizing expriences. Robert de Niro, the protagonist, is gravely traumatized and finds difficulty fitting in after the events of the war, John Savage's character loses both of his legs, and Christopher Walken's character remains at Vietnam, becoming a mindless, relentless Russian Roulette champion. My main problem with this movie is something very very simple. The first act. Dea Christ, it has to be one of the most boring first hours I have ever seen in a film, and we are talking about a three hour one. Nothing happens. I was not expecting war and conflict the minute I started the movie, of course. I needed to see the interactions of the characters and the lives they had before those events, so as to sympathize with them. But then I got a 40 minute uninterrupted scene of a marriage were nothing happens. It just killed the mood for me, and made me less excited for the strong, emotionally charged acts.  The second act is the most stressful and suspenseful in the whole movie, without a shadow of a doubt. The whole Russian Roullete scene got me standing at the edge of my seat, praying for the characters' well being. And their escape of course was equally tense. Arguably the best scene in the whole film and one of the best scenes in a film ever. The third act kind of slows down, allowing us to see the damage the Vietnam War has brought to these people's lives. That act also includes an extremely stressful and ultimately depressing scene, which also revolves around a Russian Roullete match. During the first scene, De Niro and Walken were forced against each other and fought for survival, with De Niro teaching Walken the tricks and secrets of this sinister game. Ultimately, both get out of the Viet Cong hut alive. During the second scene, De Niro and Walken go up against each other again, though this time Walken is mindless expert of the game, beating others and being crowned a famed champion. Ultimately, he is defeated by none other than his friend and master, the one who taught him the art of the game. It can't get more depressing than that. Excellent scenes in excellent second and third acts. As for the direction, Michael Cimino takes things really slow, and while it is good for scenes like the aforementioned, it is detrimental for most of the film. Such behavior and practices were what absolutely destroyed Heaven's Gate, his next film, and his reputation as a filmmaker. Other than that, most technical aspects are very good for the time, including cinematography, editing, art direction and overall visuals and sound. Music is haunting and sadness inducing. The performances are an absolute delight, some of the greatest ever, I would dare to say, with De Niro, Walken and Streep particularly standing out. Overall, this film is above average. It makes a lovely, hard hitting statement about the effects of war on the lives of innocents, and technical aspects and performances make it an enjoyable and thouroughly depressing experience. However, the film is extremely hampered by Cimino's artsy, dragging direction and possibly the worst executed first act in a film I have ever seen.",

It is a long way from a bad film, in fact it's good and often very impressive, but it's also uneven in places.\n\n'The Deer Hunter' is by some way director Michael Cimino's best film, and it contains his best ever directing. That's saying a good deal, considering that only a few years later he would go on to direct the notorious flop 'Heaven's Gate' and his career never really recovered. 'The Deer Hunter' is considered by some one of the finest Vietnam films (don't quite agree, to me there are far better examples), but it is also perhaps the most controversial. Either viewpoint is very easy to understand.\n\nDespite its many impressive, outstanding even, elements, 'The Deer Hunter' is uneven. It is a bit too long (and no before anybody sneers, there have been films of similar length and even longer that still manage to be great films, a few among the best ever made), and would have been solved by tighter editing and a little less time on the lengthy wedding sequence, which is compelling with some strong character development but could easily have been trimmed.\n\nParts are disjointed too, with some abrupt scene shifts and a heavy-handed patriotic ending that felt incredibly tacky against the rest of the film. There are deficiencies in the sound quality on top of all this.\n\nOn the other hand, editing aside, 'The Deer Hunter' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography is quite magnificent and the attention to detail in the settings and the rest of the production both sumptuous and rich in atmosphere, the authenticity also remarkable. The music haunts the mind and is very beautiful, the mournful guitar theme unforgettable.\n\nCimino is at his best in the director's chair, while the script provokes thought and the story is often incredibly powerful and moving. The highlight is the justly acclaimed Russian Roulette sequence, which today is genuinely harrowing and will stay with you forever.\n\nRobert De Niro has seldom been more restrained and gives an affecting performance. Even better is Christopher Walken, who has never reduced me to tears before and he really wrenches the heart here, making his character a compellingly real one and the most relatable one. John Savage, John Cazale (in his last film before his ultimely death) and a young Meryl Streep are sterling in support.\n\nIn summary, uneven film but often very impressive with much to admire. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Another of those (anti-)war films that you \"must\" have seen. Three aspiring young men who live a happy life of friendship in a working-class town in Pennsylvania volunteer for the Vietnam War. This fundamentally changes their lives from one day to the next and we get emotional insights into the emotional states of the protagonists as they live through a world of extremes.\n\nWar films are often ensemble pieces that usually have a \"hidden\" main character. In the case of The Deer Hunter, it is Robert de Niro, who here embodies the uncharacteristically subtle role of Michael. Initially driven by a lust for life and slight playboy traits, Michael becomes aware of the seriousness of life in his time as a war soldier in the harshest of ways. The disturbing Russian Roulette scenes he gets into as a prisoner reveal a new, fearless side to the character. It is only in the aftermath that one notices the emotional emptiness Michael carries from his Vietnam experiences. While the actors split screen time in the first \u2154 of the film, De Niro clearly takes centre stage by the end. After not having many opportunities to develop beforehand, he goes all out in the role towards the end and gives a heartbreaking performance. Christopher Walken provides this from beginning to end. His character Nick captivates you from second one. At the beginning you are happy for him, enjoy watching him dance and fool around and are also infatuated with his bromance with Michael. From the first Russian Roulette scene, Walken does a 180\u00b0 turn of emotions and the optimistic sunshine turns into a desperate trainwreck. The kink happens in a devastating hospital scene where Nick bursts into bitter tears after a near-death experience and you realise he's never the same. Despite less focus on his character, Walken manages to usurp the film as a scene-stealer and even outshine De Niro. In their moments together, the very young Meryl Streep as Linda also succeeds. She is deeply sad, naive and torn about which man to love. After disappearing in the middle, Streep goes all out in the last act and equally goes through a rollercoaster ride of emotions that makes her one of the most sympathetic characters in the film.\n\nThe Deer Hunter is a three-hour drama that, despite its epic running length, doesn't feel like a classic war epic. The film has a big impact and high production value, but is very sedate and quiet in its staging and atmosphere. There is little talking, rather the focus is on conveying the emotions of the traumatised soldiers in every single scene. War action is scarce, so the genre \"war film\" may be overstated. Director Michael Cimino has created a drama that, from the middle onwards, completely disconcerts and touches you. From the change of location from Pennsylvania to Vietnam and back again, The Deer Hunter is a terrific film. However, it takes a good 70 minutes to get to that point, during which pretty much nothing happens. Yes, they're partying exuberantly before the tragedy kicks in and counting down their last hours before enlistment. Due to the slight irrelevance of the first act, the film feels rather indifferent until the middle.",

            "content": "The Deer Hunter is a 1978 American epic war drama film co-written and directed by Michael Cimino about a trio of Russian-American steelworkers whose lives were changed forever after fighting in the Vietnam War. The three soldiers are played by Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage, with John Cazale (in his final role), Meryl Streep, and George Dzundza playing supporting roles. The story takes place in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a working-class town on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, and in Vietnam.\n\nMichael, Nick, and Steven are best friends in a small Pennsylvania town. They have been drafted into the Vietnam war and will leave the following day. We begin the movie with steven's wedding to a pregnant woman named angela. It's clear in the wedding that Michael has forbidden feelings towards  Linda Nick's girlfriend. After the wedding, Nick makes Michael promise that no matter what he will bring him back from Vietnam, and Micheal promises. Then they go hunting some dear before heading to the war that will change their lives and the lives of the ones they love miserably. \n\nNow let's get into details. The exposition managed to introduce the plot and the characters and their struggles very effectively, in the end of the exposition we were able to relate to all the characters and we understood their motives and the relations between characters were very clear. The only problem with the exposition was a pacing problem, I'm not saying that the exposition should've been shorter but some boring and unnecessary scenes could've been removed.  The rising action was flawless there is absolutely nothing to be criticized I will explain why when talking about creative elements. We could simply summarize the climax in one iconic scene which is the Russian roulette scene, the climax managed very effectively to determine the most important turning point in our main character's arcs, The climax wasn't just flawless it was a masterpiece.  The falling action is when the masterpiece begins to end and plot holes appear. Micheal's arc didn't contain any holes and the writers were more concentrated on his character, which came at the expense of the other two main character's arcs.  Steven's arc was okay actually it was very good, the only problem was that there was a turning point in his arc that wasn't shown to us on screen but it didn't affect the whole plot because the viewer could simply assume what happened. Nick's arc was great actually very great until the writers suddenly decided that Nick will disappear the entire falling action sequence and he will reappear as a whole new totally changed the character to determine the resolution, it is the only plot hole in the movie. The resolution couldn't 've been better if I could describe it in two words I would say beautiful and emotional.\n\nUsually, I talk about performances and creative elements in a part on their own, But De Niro's performance forces me to talk about him on his own, the man isn't the best actor of all time for noting. De Niro is literally the best thing in this movie, he could simply deliver the character's thoughts, feelings, and intentions with just his facial expressions, De Niro can express without expressing with just his eye movement. De Niro in this movie is simply delivering one of the best performances of his career and one of the best performances in acting history. \n\nBehind every great movie are the creative features and behind them is a talented crew and behind them is a skilled director and definitely, Cimino is one of them. The cinematography served the plot of the entire movie for example the use of depressing colors in the falling action to mirror what happened to the main character, try to notice the difference between the frames of the wedding and the closure. The cinematography reached its peak in the war sequence ( the rising action ), the camera movement reflected the environment and gave us an idea about what could've happened to our main characters, this sequence reminded me of \"apocalypse now\". The screenplay or the dialogue wasn't nor good nor bad it just delivered its purpose and served the plot well. The sound experience was okay but in the exposition sometimes we couldn't hear what the characters was saying  because the music was so loud.\n\nI consider the dear hunter one of the best movies that treated the Vietnam war. The dear hunter isn't just an anti-war movie it's about how wars could affect the lives of normal people soldiers or non-soldiers, it's about how the war can dehumanize the soldiers, it's bout friendship, patriotism, loyalty, and love. Of course, the movie is far from flawless we have mentioned several flaws above but advise every one of you who wants to watch great cinema to go watch this movie right now. \n\nrating : 9/10",

            "content": "Bolstered by a strong cast, great performances, and some fantastic cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter tells the story of three men from small-town Pennsylvania and the bonds they form prior to, during, and after their service in Vietnam.  Essentially divided into three acts, the final two acts (Vietnam and the aftermath) are testament to the depths of friendship and are powerful indictments of the horrors of war.  However, already running over three hours, the film is hindered by the ponderous opening act, most notably the wedding scene, which drones on for far too long with little purpose other than to establish the relationships of the characters and to offer an ominous warning from a returning veteran, all of which could have been accomplished much more efficiently through other means.  Regardless, The Deer Hunter remains a classic that deserves to be seen.",

            "content": "Michael Cimino's \"The Deer Hunter\" is an ambitious, deeply moving and riveting war epic that sheds light on psychological trauma faced by Vietnam War soldiers. With his  second feature, Cimino created an unforgettable war epic about psychological effects of war that holds up today as a classic of the genre. Using gorgeous cinematography, Cimino draws viewers into the world of three friends whose lives are influenced by the Vietnam war. Cimino expertly uses camerawork to distinguish between the flashback sequences and present-day scenes. Hand-held cinematography immerses viewers into the flashbacks, while steadier shots capture the aftermath faced by war soldiers. Cimino showcases immense control over the production design, locations and musical score, using these elements to create an immersive cinematic experience. Deric Washburn's script is also superb, and effectively uses non-linear storytelling to paint a compassionate portrait of the psychological effects of warfare. It's hard to not praise phenomenal performances from the cast. Robert De Niro delivers one of the finest performances of his career as Mike Vronsky. With mesmerizing expressions, he captures the angst, courage and perseverance of a conflicted soldier that struggles to adjust back to normal life following war service. Christopher Walken is also excellent in the role of a maniacal soldier that is adversely affected by warfare. In one of his most iconic roles, Walken brings palpable intensity to the movie. The final, most unforgettable standout in the cast is Meryl Streep. As a widowed woman that searches for connection, she brings humanity to the movie in one of her first performances. Although \"The Deer Hunter\" is undeniably a powerful war drama, ultimately it isn't a flawless film. At 3 hours, it suffers slightly from an extended running-time that tests the viewer's patience. Due to the length, there are times when the film loses momentum particularly in its mid- act. Nevertheless, fans of war dramas will definitely enjoy \"The Deer Hunter\" and so will movie-goers seeking taut entertainment. In light of the recent 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War, it remains a stirring tribute to the soliders that fought the most gruesome genocide in the history of mankind.",

After vietnam is when the movie is at its most honest, sad, and heartfelt, and it is the message that this final act gives out regarding war, duty, service, friendship, love, depression, violence, PTSD, and the somber look of the effects that war has on soldiers, and the humans around them. The often cited issue with this movie is the run time, and while I will say it is the reason I give it 4.5 instead of 5. But it isnt the fact that it's long its more the first act length that takes away .5 stars it could have been at minimum 1/4 shorter or even 1/2 shorter in the pre vietnam section of the movie and not lose anything at all really.

Well, Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is another one of these that depicts post-war trauma. In the first act, Michael (Robert DeNiro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Stan (John Cazale) attend Stephen's (John Savage) wedding while going out hunting. Second Act, Michael, Nick and Stephen get kidnapped by Viet cong mercenaries, partake in Russian roulette, and escape. Third act, Michael returns home a changed man, reunites with his old friends and hooks up with Nick's girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). While not without some intensely powerful scenes and poignant performances, the story seems awfully similar to The Best Years of Our Lives, with the premise centering on three individuals who have entered war and returned home to their families. You also have the characters suffer through shell shock and ponder about their current lives in their hometown. Finally, both films have a wedding of sorts with one of the main leads. However, unlike Best Years, on top of it being much darker, you see the main characters in Deer Hunter at war and the contrast between their lives before and after the war. Regardless, despite my appreciation of Cimino's savage realism, I prefer William Wyler's film, mostly because it had more honesty and authenticity. \n\n(4 Twinkies Dipped in Mustard out of 5)",

Christopher Walken and John Savage do a great job. With Walkens fun character changing as he goes AWOL and forgetting his life back home. The many scenes with De Niron and Walken are strong, from the scene where Walken says if anything happens take me home to the Russian Roulette. Walken is very natural in his role, we watch his fun and enjoyment turn into a nightmare in his head.  A well deserved Oscar win. Savages character from a wedding to eventually being in a wheelchair at a funeral. See De Niron and Savage in the hospital is very moving. There is plenty of sadness, there is plenty of loss of innocence and how life changes fast and dramatically. The Vietnam war is how it changed people, how different react but how it can mess with your head. The Russian Roulette is shocking, and the debate whether it happened will keep going. Human life becomes something with gamble for just like the amount of men who died in the war. I was upset at the end of the movie, it touched me as they sing remembering better days. The song itself is very ironic about America. The opening third of the movie is terrific as we see a small community from their work, their drinking, their hunting and a well staged wedding. The fun and enjoyment that everyone had. The film changes quickly into the war, we see a village being bombed and we see dead bodies. De Niros character as he comes back from the war he becomes more quiet and intravert. He can't and kill anymore he has seen too much. The depiction of the Vietnamese people is very one sided and it does let it down slightly. We are not meant to like them as they seem very blood thirsty. The camera and cinematography is terrific, the small industrial village has a simpleness to it and the mountains from the hunting is gorgeous. War is hell, war changes lives, including the people most closest to you. Its an anti war movie that makes you think and makes you care. After the war you go home and things have to change.",

            "content": "The Deer Hunter serves as both a tribute to those who (un)willingly served in Vietnam and a condemnation of the war effort, a dichotomy that became more blurred in films such as Platoon and Full Metal Jacket. But for The Deer Hunter, it focuses on the psychological impact that the Vietnam War had on its young participants. For the first hour of the film, the viewer is introduced to a rambunctious group of fun-loving Pennsylvanian steel-workers who enjoy deer-hunting and tail-chasing. The wedding party scene serves as the perfect contrast for the drastic shift in psychology that the men undergo after their torturous (to say the least) experience in Vietnam. The film did not linger for long on the men's days on the battlefield and in captivity (at least when compared to other contemporary films), which I found refreshing. It serves as more of a character study than a 'war film.' Seeing the men broken down through a brutal game of Russian Roulette and watching poor Nicky eventually succumb to the game's torment was all the more heartbreaking. Speaking of Nicky, Christopher Walken truly gave the performance of his career and stole nearly every scene he was a part of. Like Charlie Sheen's Chris Taylor in Platoon, Nicky served as the metaphor for the loss of innocence that the Vietnam War became (in)famous for. The ensemble cast did extremely well and added to the immersion of this all-too-real and visceral tale. However, I did find faults with the film in its pacing and length. For a film to justify a 3 HOUR run time, it needs to be of exceptional quality and be properly paced. Unfortunately, The Deer Hunter could only fulfill the former. Scenes dragged for excessive periods of time and lingered on moments that added absolutely nothing to the overall narrative. I'm all for realism, but the wedding scene was absurdly lengthy, despite the message of the scene being clear in the first few minutes (it felt like a half hour - it may very well have been). The film could have been 2:15 hours and still have been just as effective. However, I don't think this spoils the experience enough to knock it down below its contemporaries. The Deer Hunter remains an essential Vietnam War flick watch, alongside Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket.",

With a run-time of over 180 minutes, scenes from before Vietnam could definitely have been cut/shortened and the film still would have been able to showcase the friends' relationship from Western Pennsylvania to Southeast Asia. The iconic Russian roulette scene is the most sphincter clenching one I've watched since the \"why you flanking me?\" scene in Wind River and is the scene where Mike (De Niro) and Nick (Walken) take two very different paths after their time in the war. And don't worry, there are plenty more roulette scenes than the one known by most. I thoroughly enjoyed the hunting scenes set to the opera mountain backdrop. What this movie also does is shows how far we've come concerning the stigma of vets spending time in clinics or institutions to recover from their experiences. I found it strange that Mike's friends and Stevie's wife couldn't even tell him where Stevie (John Savage) was located\u2014which was an institution-type place where he was recovering from the psychological trauma of his time in Vietnam and the surgery that removed his legs. I also didn't understand why Mikey had to \"pay to play\" in the final roulette showdown. Wouldn't the players, given the immense stakes, being getting paid to take those chances? Lastly, the ending was powerful, but would've preferred John (George Dzundza) continuing to hum/sing \"God Bless America\" without knowing all the words, without any of the others joining in.",

Much like Gone with the Wind (1939) and Apocalypse Now (1979) you feel completely involved in the lives of the characters whose lives you see shaped by the horrors of the Vietnam war and the minutiae of their lives becomes important to you. This is a great war movie because it's not really about the violence experienced on the battle field but about how this violence changes once innocent young men forever and hurts those around them. This film was deserving of it's Best Picture win and of it's status as one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nMichael Vronsky, Robert De Niro, Nick Chevotarevich, Christopher Walken, and Steven Pushkov, John Savage, three young Russian-Americans from Clairton, Pennsylvania experience terror during their time serving in the Vietnam war as they are forced to play Russian Roulette in their Prisoner of War camp. They are able to escape after Vronsky shoots their captors and carries a severely injured Pushkov to safety after losing Chevotarevich. Vronsky returns home and begins a tentative romantic relationship with Linda, Meryl Streep, who had been the longtime girlfriend of Chevotarevich. In Vietnam Chevotarevich has become addicted to playing Russian Roulette and Vronsky decides to make one last attempt at saving him which brings disastrous consequences.\n\nI was amazed at how interested I remained as we spent a whole hour watching some very normal people enjoy themselves at a wedding as the impending doom of warfare looms. The detail paid to capturing the lives of people with very few hopes outside of finding someone that they love to marry and keeping their jobs at the local market was what allowed me to feel so emotionally invested in these characters. It was this first hour that made me so horrified when we cut to scenes of a family being burned alive in Vietnam and then to the torture that these three men face in the camp. I felt that I knew them and wanted their lives back home to continue even if their aspirations weren't fantastical.\n\nThe scenes of Russian Roulette themselves are well crafted and tense as we fear the sight of a man's bloody face as that dreadful click sounds. The actors have a great deal to do with this effect of course but Cimino really builds up an atmosphere of fear and tension with the Vietnamese men loitering around them and their friends drowning in the background that leaves you horrified. We don't just cut back to civilian life either as we see how difficult it is to get away from the camp and back onto dry land where long stays in hospitals await them and it is difficult to contact their friends back home. The film is unrelenting but it never feels over long or gratuitous, a credit to the director's immense talent.\n\nThe performances are impressive as Streep in particular impresses in one of her earliest film roles. She is lovely as the troubled Linda who is torn between two men and yet her struggle never feels superficial and I never felt as though we were meant to believe she loved either of these men but rather needed emotional support and turned to two people she had known since childhood for it. Streep never pushes too hard as there is subtlety and texture even in the love scenes between herself and De Niro and she pulls of the accent as well you would expect. I believed in these characters because the actors felt very natural in their roles and even with small gestures they were able to convey so much.\n\nThis is one of the greatest Best Picture winners I have ever seen, I have seen 83, because it achieves exactly what it sets out to do and is a thoroughly intimate film that leaves you feeling for those men and women who faced this conflict. I loved the film and I would call it one of the best I have ever seen, although I say that often, even though it is a war film, not a genre I particularly like, because it is an emotional experience more than an action film.",

Then the boys go deer hunting (in mountains that are anyplace but the Appalachians of Pennsylvania). Then Presto! They are in Vietnam. DeNiro uses a flamethrower on horrible Viet Cong. Then Presto! They are playing Russian Roulette. No narrative of their life in the military, or encountering the real issues of why we were there, or the debate about it. How these three guys just HAPPENED to all still be together through the military journey. There is no storytelling of how they got where they are. The US military and military machine is completely absent from the film. Its a 70\u2019s Buddy film, from unthinking writers who made up random scenes, of unthinking people, placed in a horrible situation, used the Vietnamese as the enemy, and ignored the whole complexity of history because they didn\u2019t understand it, and never considered it. And the final \u2018God Bless America\u2019, aside from these good unthinking folks still showing love of country, plays out like the US absolving itself of its actions in Vietnam.

I think the first Act is a failure because it is just a drawn out wedding with aimless drunken antics and no substance. Act II shows the bravery and leadership of the Michael character while also showcasing the horrors of war, especially the Vietnam war. Here Nick feels abandoned and can't deal with his feelings so he tries to cling to apathy as his one link to sanity. Act III is the return of the characters back to their hometown, with none of them really the same, but with hopeful futures even though they have been in and out of a meat grinder. Michael refuses to put up with the crap that his friends pull any longer, and can't seem to bring himself to take down a majestic deer after he spent so much time trying to escape hunters himself. Stephen is forced out of his apathy by Michael, but he can't do the same with Nick, and as so often happens with our veterans, Nick takes his own life to secure his hold on the absence of feeling. They mourn at his funeral at the end, but sing of America because Nick was a soldier fighting for originally what he felt was his duty, and it brings them comfort because in death it is difficult to see the point of anything. To say that Nick died for his country would still be true, and it works for them to mentally handle. This is where the movie ends and I'm not sure the ending of the film is that great as it's very open-ended to interpretation, but I still can't say this is a bad film with all of the stellar acting and two thirds of the film being as adrenaline pumping as it was.",

And while I can see that it could have been more shorter, I think that it has this great emotional impact because Cimino took his time in a very long first act that made us dive into the characters, and most importantly, their relationship. \n\nThis first act with all its very very long scenes that feel as they were unedited is what made us care deeply about his characters when they were thrown inside a terrifically tense, gut-wrenching second act. That's how Cimino made us thoroughly disturbed, and have mixed, and vague feelings that result in creating a great catharsis at the third act. \n\nEvery actor gave a very realistic performance, needless to say that both De Niro and Meryl Streep shine, but Christopher Walken's Oscar-winning performance is the standout here. \n\nAll the characters are fully-developed, and fleshed out, but they are incredibly realistic and three-dimensional that can be analyzed as they are Shakespearean or Tolstoyan characters.\n\nI can't believe or describe how emotionally sweeping and overwhelming this epic is.\n\n(9/10)",

Certainly, some of those who do like it would probably say that this is undeniable proof of it being a \"good film\" or indeed \"classic\". I would say that it is more a symptom of widespread unquestioned groupthink, and that people who watch it amd say they like it do so because, for one reason or other, they don't want to go against masses of popular opinion. Either that, or huge scores of people just have horribly bad taste.\n\nBecause I unreservedly fail to understand what is so good about a film that squanders a talented cast amidst a threadbare plot and characters that barely develop within the poorly paced (approximately) three hour long run time. And what (little) plot and character developments there are, is so poorly and sloppily executed, that they amount to more or less nothing in the end. Personally, I didn't care one iota about the characters or story in this badly edited and directed disaster.\n\nIf anything, the 'Deer Hunter' is evidence that Robert Dear Niro starred in some stinkers way back then in his hayday when he was lauded and (to some extent) overrated as one of the world's greatest actors, a view which has since been undermined in recent years by an acting career in continual decline due to a string of bad roles, film choices, and performances.

At three hours long, it dedicates a long time to juxtaposing the mentalities before and after combat experiences, commenting not just on the difference in soldiers but also their loved ones at home. It's hard to argue that it did not execute these elements well but maybe full impact was lost on someone who has seen cinema's reflections of Vietnam atrocities on numerous occasions. Furthermore, 'The Deer Hunter' isn't the most graphic, most emotional nor does it offer the most compelling set of characters. However, a feature which certainly distinguishes it is the two Russian roulette scenes. The tension in these moments are truly gripping and disturbing as you watch soldiers forced to play a game that finely balances life and death for the entertainment of others. The two leads, Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken, are at their best in these scenes and it is their acceptance that fate is out of their control which underlines the realisation that Russian roulette is a metaphor for war itself. While as a whole I still do not consider the movie a classic, these two scenes are definitely classic pieces of cinema and ones which vitally gifts 'The Deer Hunter' with dramatic resonance.",

Sure enough, this intense film about the horrors of war and the way it traumatizes the soldiers who go through it, was not easy to watch. It did an amazing job of showing the awful way that humans can treat each other and how dramatically that can tear apart ordinary lives. One of the interesting aspects is that it accomplishes all this without a single line of expository dialogue. We are just watching these people live their lives and it gives us a real connection to the events they suffer through. The big downfall of The Deer Hunter is the length. This film is dragged out at least an hour longer than it needed to be. This is felt the most in the first act when we have to slog through so much of these people's lives before going to war. The 30+ minute wedding scene is almost unbearable, and had me really tempted to hit the fast-forward button. I totally understand that the goal was to establish what the world was like for these characters before going to war, so we'd have a nice contrast when the third act rolled around, but they didn't need this amount of time to accomplish that. I can totally see why this film was critically-acclaimed and it does feature some of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen from Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. Sadly, the length was just too much for me to take, and the story is so dark that I don't expect it is a movie I will revisit.",

The segments with the Russian Roulette games are nail-bitingly intense; never knowing who's walking away from that table and those scenes are what will stick with you. The film is broken up into three acts with a wedding/going away party, the vietnam sequences, and then the return home and at times it feels like an elaborately staged play. As said before, the film is simply too long and it hinders its chances at re-watchability, but Michael Cimino became a one-hit wonder, so I guess having one 3-hour epic under your belt is solid to him. This is not a cheery film and it was one of the first to tackle the effects of the Vietnam war on the returning soldiers, but it is a classic amongst cinephiles and if you have the patience for it, should be seen at least once.",

The 1979 Oscar Best Picture winner is 183 mins long. And it has a lot going for it, despite its flaws (and not just the fabricated dramatic device that is the Russian Roulette which probably never took place back in Vietnam then): literally the whole cast is full of raw, young talent whose performances are nuanced and just amazing to watch ; the cinematography is sumptuous, stark and sad all at the same time and of course there was that theme, something so simple yet so evocative of the whole feel of the film, if not its era, it was used sparingly in the film to great effect and still gives you goosebumps now. Yet I feel disappointed. I don't think the first hour setting up the community, the relationships and the context in which the film is set is unnecessary but I do believe the wedding can have the same impact if it is cut by a third. The next 2 hours could also do with some judicious editing but at least, the plotting is better served by the pacing of the film here. Ultimately I am just annoyed that somewhere there is a better and tighter paced 2hrs or 2h20min film that I would have enjoyed a lot more; one which I believe can be equally poignant, poetic and impactful than the slightly bloated but wholly indulgent director's cut here that not only numbs my ass but also my brain.",

I will admit that I felt rather mislead about this movie, as my impression was they would be captured and moved into a big game where their captors profited on their luck when they pulled the trigger.  Instead it has a lot more of the lead up, going home, search to save a friend on the other side of the world.  The wedding party scene went on simply forever in the first half of the film, and was kinda a bore and featured very little information that would have any effect on the latter events.  The action was good when it came around and didn't shy away at anything, however some more lead up to what happened in the village when we first see Vietnam and their capture in the aftermath would have been great, as we simply see them there, then they are in a cage.  The games of Roulette are for sure the best parts, as the suspense, acting, and filming mesh together to make a very good scene.  The ending left a little to be desired, but wasn't bad.  Overall a good Vietnam war movie, not the best, but one of the more interesting and unique stories.",

Though over three hours long, it's astonishing, paced so achingly right and I can see why he rightfully earned the 'carte blanche' that would unfortunately lead to his downfall (as well as an entire studio's) as soon as he made his next film. But to reach such heights and to have such ambition--as well as undeniable talent--is a victory in and of itself. Just armed with the main five actors alone, at the zenith of their craft, a fine script (really the first interesting and well-deliberated Vietnam film to hit the big screen) and Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera meant that this would prove something special. Scenes that will haunt you forever. My favourite shot is the incredible 360-degree pan shot around Linda's bedroom when she realizes she's given up on Nick and is going to declare her love to Michael--extraordinary stuff. What's YOURS?\n\nMany film lovers who despise Cimino's work instantly clam up when 'The Deer Hunter' is mentioned...and there's a reason for that.

            "content": "\"You have to think about one shot. One shot is what it's all about. A deer's gotta be taken with one shot. I try to tell people that but they don't listen\"\n\nReleased in 1978, only three years after the official end of the Vietnam war, Michael Cimino's \"The Deer Hunter\" seemed as if it may have been too soon for the American psyche. It was a surprising box-office hit but was also one of the most controversial, major theatrical releases about America's involvement in the war. It went on to receive 9 Academy Award nominations (winning 5 - including Best Picture and Best Director). Despite this, the backlash was pretty vehement. It received criticism from the likes of Jane Fonda and John Wayne who in his last public appearance had to present it with it's Best Picture award even though he wasn't fond of the film. These criticisms came in many forms but for as many critics as it's had, there were also a great number who considered it to be another American classic.\n\nMichael (Robert DeNiro), Stevie (John Savage) and Nick (Christopher Walken) are among a group of friends who live and work in the steel mill town of Clairton, Pennsylvania. They spend their time getting drunk and going deer hunting before they are enlisted in the airborne infantry of Vietnam. What was once a slow-paced and fun-filled life is shoved into the stark reality of warfare and how their experiences change their lives forever.\n\nClocking in at just over three hours, \"The Deer Hunter\" is a film of length. However, it's one that never overstays it's welcome as Cimino wisely works within a three act structure - book-ending the war with marriage and death. He may take his time and linger long on shots but it never gets boring. To view it as simply another Vietnam film is to entirely miss the point also. If it is to be viewed in any way, it should be as a commentary on American disillusionment and it's loss of innocence at this time. It's intention is not focus on the war itself but on the aftermath and the impact war can have on the lives of ordinary working people. In fact, the scenes that take place in Vietnam only amount to a very small portion of the film, overall. Ultimately, it's a character study that's only heightened by the 50 minute wedding sequence at the beginning of the film. Many grumble about this being too indulgent but it's integral that we get to know these characters in order to fully understand them. It's during the wedding reception that they come across a Green Beret who has just finished his Tour of Duty; they buy him a drink and take offence when all he has to tell them about the war is... \"Fuck it!\". This perfectly sums up the naivete of these young men as they seem to have a romanticised idea of war and have absolutely no idea of what is to become them. \n\nFollowing this, a bunch of them go on a deer hunting trip where we again see the dynamic of the group and get to know each of them more personally. Suddenly, we are then thrust into the chaos of Vietnam and it's not before long that the films iconic and controversial Russian roulette scene takes place. This is a scene that has received much criticism in not only being claimed as inaccurate - as there was no evidence to suggest that any such atrocities took place during the conflict - but for being racist in it's sadistic stereotype of the Viet Cong captors. These criticisms are justifiable to an extent but, personally, I think the critics have taken it far too literally. If viewed as a metaphor for the senselessness of war and the inhumanity of man during wartime struggles then it's entirety fitting to the films themes and says more about an initiation into manhood. It was literally minutes before this powerful scene that DeNiro's Michael and Walken's Nick were discussing how a deer should be killed with \"one shot\" and now (ironically) they must face a similar fate. This game of chance is the catalyst that changes the dynamic of the three principle characters (the other being John Savage's Stevie) and further adds to the character development that was so playfully and innocently displayed in the opening wedding sequence or the camaraderie of the deer hunt. It's purpose is not to be racist but to capture the extreme pressure that soldiers face in conflict. In the film's final act, some of them return home only to realise that they're traumatised as they struggle to fit back into society. There have been claims that it doesn't take an overly pro or anti stance towards the conflict but I struggle to see how. This was one was of the first films to challenge the perspective on Vietnam. The likes of \"Platoon\" and \"Full Metal Jacket\" were praised for such honesty and I believe this deserves the same credibility.\n\n\"The Deer Hunter\" is, undoubtedly, epic filmmaking and despite your political interpretation, there's no denying the power of it's emotionally devastating narrative. It's unlikely that Cimino will be able to deliver a work of this magnitude ever again. He tried and failed in 1980 with \"Heaven's Gate\" (bankrupting United Artists Studio in the process) but his scope and ambition here deserves the utmost respect. So too does the work of cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond for his astounding ability to capture both the expansive landscapes of Pennsylvania and the war ravaged mountainous villages of Vietnam. The actors are also very strong and committed throughout. This would be the last performance of the great John Cazale - before his untimely death to cancer - and the first notable one from Meryl Streep, who brings a touching vulnerability to her supporting role. Walken (who won a Supporting Actor Oscar) is a marvel and deservedly made a name for himself in the process. As good as they are, though, it's DeNiro who anchors the film in a enigmatic display of stoicism. Another deserved Oscar nomination came his way and even though this is a film that many omit from DeNiro's plethora of magnificent performances throughout the 70's and 80's, it happens to be one of his strongest and most unsung. DeNiro apparently described his role as one of the most physical and exhausting that he's ever done, and it's easy to see why. Every emotional, physical and mental abuse that he seems to be suffering is perfectly and gruellingly displayed onscreen.\n\nThe 1970's are well known for producing some of the finest experiences in cinema and \"The Deer Hunter\" can, proudly, consider itself one of one them. It's marvellously structured, harrowingly vivid and so grand and ambitious that it thoroughly deserves it's epic status. Truly one of the best of it's decade.\n\nMark Walker",

Especially De Niro (played Michael). He's good looking now, but in this film he was EXTREMELY good looking. Wow. Even Christopher Walken looked good.\n\nAnyways....\n\nThis was certainly a pick at the Vietnam War and all wars in general. They did not sugar coat anything in this film. War is nasty business and it can really destroy someone - even if they don't die or get maimed. It can cripple you or mess up your mind. I'm glad that the writers decided to show each side of the madness of war. One friend gets crippled forever, one snaps mentally. Poor Michael trying to hold everything together before, during, and after the war. He was their leader, their best friend. They guy everyone went to. I loved him, but man, did I feel bad for him.\n\nI'm not going to lie...I usually don't watch many Vietnam War movies and I wasn't too keen on this one. However, Boyfriend REALLY wanted to watch it and so I gave in and watched it with him. Low and behold, I actually liked it. Perhaps it was because of all the actors in it. They are all fantastic! The beginning really was super slow and I nearly gave up. HOWEVER, it picks up after the deer hunt they go on. I get WHY they made the beginning slow. There are a lot of characters they wanted to establish and get you to know and understand. They wanted you to see how life was BEFORE the war. After the movie was done, I really appreciated the beginning, because it allowed me to connect with all the characters.\n\nOH! The ending made me tear up, but it certainly was a good ending. It made me a little mad...but it certainly was good. I shall say no more.\n\nIt was a good movie and I recommend anyone who has any interest in history or likes a good movie, should watch this. The acting was wonderful. The story was engaging even though the beginning was a little slow. It was certainly worth the 3 hours. Out of five stars I shall stamp this 5 stars. It's more like 4.5, but I don't give decimals, so I rounded.\n\nFavorite Character(s): Michael, Linda, Axel (I wish he had more camera time), and John.\nNot-so Favorite Character(s): Steve, Angela (pull yourself together woman!), and Stan.",

Well tonight, I was shouted at and my punishment was to watch The Deer Hunter, I say punishment, what i really mean to say is pleasure because this film is just intense, brooding with charisma and unrelentless from the word go. Mike, Nick, Stan and Steve are among a bunch of steel workers in america during the height of the vietnam war. After Steve is married, himself, Savage, Mike, De Niro and Nick, Walken, are sent through to fight against the vietnamese. The trio are taken prisoner and are forced into a horrendously tense form of torture you will all be aware of as russian rullette. The 3 manages to escape... Just. And we follow them in their tracks from that point onwards, some successfull others not so much. Firstly this film is a grand piece of work, using long shots to allow entire scenes to run out, the cast as an ensemble just work perfectly, each character has a specific personality, each actor plays subtle looks and exchanges but its never glossed over with broad strokes, just enough exposition to give you a sense of relation and feeling towards this group of friends. The acting as i said is close to perfection, with streep, de niro and walken putting in career high performances, while the supporting cast prop them up in all their glory. Its a long film and at times it does feel like a lot of scenes could have been cut in order to get to the knitty gritty, but part of its charm is allowing the film to mature over time and have it continue to build, it never bores. I did have a small issue with the transisions between america and vietnam however. your just thrust right in, for all the time in the world that the director takes with building up scenes in america once its in vietnam its quick, snappy and throws your off your guard. Not a massive fault but jarring enough to be noticable. At the end of the day however this film is a master class of talent and one that i cannot believe has taken me this long to see. Strongly recommended upon all people.",

I commend the film for its approach and I see how it succeeded in bringing us into the lives of the characters in such a believable, relatable and touching way but it could have been done without hitting the three hour mark- here the length ultimately goes against the film which is a real shame considering how magnificent it would have been if all of the successful stuff was the whole film rather than there being so much space in between which, for me anyway, really took away my interest and made it feel anti-climactic at times too.\n\nAside from the punishing length considering the fairly basic story, it's still a film worth watching. The performances are great with De Niro and Streep at their usual top-level but with Walken giving a career-defining performance too along a strong showing from Calaze. There are some truly outstanding scenes which stay in your mind long after viewing and the whole approach of the film feels fresh today, never mind in the 70's!\n\nI wouldn't say it's the definitive war movie, or even the definitive Vietnam one, nor does it feel like a particularly strong love story as a whole but its drama is huge as is its originality and determination.\n\nI wanted to like this one more if I'm honest but the overall experience wasn't what I'd hoped for. Despite the disappointment, there's still some brilliant stuff in here and if you can forget about the reputation and view the film at face value (and don't mind slow-pacing) then you'll get something from this. Also, a must-see for De Niro fans of course.",

            "content": "The Deer Hunter is an exemplary war film for many reasons. It demands your heart's compassion and your mind's attention. The performances are spot on from the main characters, which is of course of utmost importance due to any war film's need for the audience's realisation of the effects war has on so many people. One can notice this from De Niro's Michael, the war veteran (in the latter half of the film), from Walken's disturbed Nick and from Streep's Linda, who is also troubled in more ways than one making her character alone a complex aspect of this brutal but beautiful character study of a picture. \r\n\r\nSome may be turned off by the film's length, being three hours long, while others will turn a blind eye probably because of the film's reputation as a classic. However, I am a firm believer that it is necessary to be as long as it is. Firstly, it requires depth of character study, in other words we have to care about the people we are watching (this is partly due to the process of the bittersweet scenes from the start leading to the ingenious quick cut to the scenes of violence and claustrophobia the characters experience in Vietnam), it requires epic status partly because of the length of the war and the length of time it has remained etched into people's memories among many other reasons. \r\n\r\nWhile the film as a whole has gained much acclaim, it is the set pieces that pull the film through to gold status. The obvious scenes to discuss would be the Russian roulette ones. They would deserve high praise even if the rest of the film were to be excruciatingly poor. Anyone I know that has seen it has effectively said the same thing, it is fist clenchingly vexing but at the same time, extremely upsetting. It has been and always will be one of those scenes that has unmatched emotional power. Another of the better scenes would be the scene where John Cazale, who plays a friend of the to-be-exported for service, (an extremely selfish and hot-headed friend but a friend nonetheless) begs Michael for his spare pair of boots and is then driven to insult him as retaliation for not lending him them. While it is a heated and intense scene, it still has a sense of comedy to it but ultimately it increases our sympathy for these people.",

Shortly before this, Steven gets married to his pregnant girlfriend Angela, and the three friends along with their other friends Stanley, Axel and John go on one last deer hunt. What happens after that...I'll keep my mouth shut on.\n\nI was told that this movie was good, but that didn't stop me from being surprised at how specifically good it was. The story was very well told, the acting was great, the choice of cast was rather remarkable in a way. I mean we have Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, even Christopher Walken was in this film giving a pretty good and likable performance, and I don't say that often when it comes to that guy to be frank. I should also note that this is sadly the last film John Cazale performed in before he died. He had terminal cancer and the studio had to be convinced by the director, Michael Cimino and Meryl Streep whom he was dating at the time (yeah I know right? who would've thought?) to be allowed to perform in the project and he sadly didn't live to see the film. But anyway, one of the main complaint people will have about this film is how in Vietnam, the Vietnamese are using Russian roulette with their POW's when it's been reported that there wasn't even a shred of that in the actual war. But other people like Roger Ebert argued - to which I agree with - it worked better that this film had that because it gave a really good symbolism that gives an ideal about war in general, not just Vietnam. And as the film progresses, it went much more into what war does in both symbolic and literal ways. However it there is one down I would find it that the film is a little bit too long. Not so much that a huge chunk should've been let out, but it still could've been a slight bit shorter.\n\nAnd that's my review for The Deer Hunter. it's not recommended if you're after a historically accurate view of Vietnam, but it still tells a great story with excellent acting, very good symbolism, and is just a great film altogether with little wonder that it won best picture.",

Every movie I see with De Niro I say 'oh that was his best performance' but then I watch another movie where he out acts himself and I'm not sure if it can get any better than this. Robert De Niro in this movie was out of this world and I think it's his best and I'm sure many will disagree but that's the great thing about opinions. He along with Christopher Walken dominated the screen, when they were there you were focused on them and nothing else mattered, it was so intense, so powerful and so perfect, it is unbelievable. One thing I appreciated and one thing I wish more films would do is that this film has perfect build up, it doesn't expect you to like the main protagonists just because they're the focus and we should like them just because, no, the first hour is the amazing build up with not much happening but by just showing normal people in their normal everyday lives we get to know them as real people and it works, the second hour is the war and the third hour is the aftermath and its all perfect and it makes the heartbreak even worse because we see before and after. The infamous russian roulette scenes are just as gut wrenching as you've hear and the authenticity they went to create these scenes is even worse. Some of Walkens improvised scenes and Streep's own dialogue just add to the realism, its great and you should watch it the next chance you get.

            "content": "I've been wanting to see this movie for quite a while now, and I loved it!\n\nFirstly, the positives. Wonderfully realistic performances from all of the cast, in particular the four main leads (Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, John Savage and Meryl Streep). Whilst I haven't seen the other nominations for Best Supporting Actor from that year, I do think Christopher Walken probably deserved his Oscar for his role. I thought the cast had a great chemistry with each other, particularly with the main six friends; I genuinely believed that they were a group of friends (not just some actors turning up for their paychecks, as with some movies). Great directing from Michael Cimino, with some really interesting action scenes. For me,some of the best parts of the movie were the Russian Roulette scenes; the atmosphere was so intense, they really got me hooked. Good editing and a moving score rounded up what was a great movie.\n\nUnfortunately, there were a few negatives. The main one, for me, was the length. It's just over 3 hours, which would be alright if it kept me hooked throughout its entirety. Sadly, the first act really dragged. I also thought the section with the wedding in particular was way too long. I was sitting there thinking \"Alright, they get married. Now can we have fighting and Russian Roulette please?\". Speaking of which, when they actually got to Vietnam, they barely showed any actual soldiers fighting. I'd been looking forward to it, and got about 5 minutes tops! Also, there were a few minor plot points that were either missing or skipped, that I would rather have been left in there. For example, when Mike is taking Stephen home from the military hospital, I would've liked to see Stephen reuniting with his friends and loved ones at home. Instead, just as they're getting ready to leave the hospital, it cuts back to Nick in Saigon. I was thinking to myself \"Why? We already know Nick's going crazy, let's focus on a plot point where we don't know where it's going\".\n\nDespite those disadvantages, I still really liked the movie, and would definitely recommend it to anyone (although, like me, I'd recommend you watch it in 2 sittings; I don't know if I'd have got through it in 1 sitting)!",

When they come back, their lives are changed forever. The movie is nicely broken up into 3 Acts that last about an hour each. The first hour is easily the one everyone complains about because it shows the characters at a wedding and going out deer hunting. To me, this is needed because we find out who these characters are and how the act. When the second act gets going, we can see all that boyish charm and innocence go out the window. The last act show how these characters are never going to be the same as they were in the firts hour. Christopher Walken is worthy of his Best Supproting Actor Oscar and De Niro is De Niro. It's not a fun movie to sit through, but is is one of the best war films that actually doesn't show any war. \n\nGrade: A",

And all around,every  actor in this film provide it with power that the sometimes messy screenplay could have ruined. No film buff should go without watching De Niro walk throught the surreal streets of Saigon as he desperatly searches for his troubled friend (Walken).
