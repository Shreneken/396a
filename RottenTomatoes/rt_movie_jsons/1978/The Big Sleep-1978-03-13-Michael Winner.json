I can see why some people who obviously  watched the 1946 version might not like the 1978 version just because of the change in venue from the US west coast in 1946 to London England in 1978, perhaps the change in cinematography from black & white in 1946 to color in 1978, and the change in actors from Bogart and Bacall in 1946 to Mitchem in 1978.  But both Bogart and Mitchem rank very high on my list of favorite actors, so I thoroughly enjoyed both movies, with enough differences to make the recast 1978 movie just as enjoyable as the original 1946 movie.",

            "content": "Huge Chandler fan here. Have read The Big Sleep four or five times. While I believe movies should stand on their own, there is a special relationship between source novels and their adaptations which can't help but color one's perception. Chandler seems especially hard to adapt because his prose style and the moods he evokes are so specific and nuanced. You can tell the filmmakers here were devoted to the source material as it is the most literal retelling of Chandler novel I've seen. But strict adherence to original plot and dialogue doesn't mean it's good. It manages to capture the letter of the book but not the spirit. The book is set in rainy L.A., whereas this film version is set in sunny England. No, that's not a typo; it's just one of the weird ass elements that makes this film such a misfire. It appears the entire film was shot on locations instead of sets, which normally would add to a sense of verisimilitude, but here it just makes everything ring all the more false somehow. The movie leans into the more risque details of the novel and earns its R rating by exposing many breasts and even the briefest flash of nether regions, but it manages to do so in a decidedly unsexy way. Many of the performances are stilted or downright bizarre, and it comes close to being so bad it's good, especially in the \"action\" sequences, but mainly it's just a 1970s curiosity that might appeal to fans of Chandler who enjoy shaking their heads in bemusement. The Long Goodbye (1973) is still probably the best screen adaptation of Chandler, though I think the most Chandleresque film is the Coen brothers' The Man Who Wasn't There (2001), which while not based on Chandler per se captures the wit, mood, and atmosphere of the master better than any other movie I've seen.",

Not only is there a change in acting styles but also in the view points the movies express on practically everything. I prefer the remake to the original, that is for certain. The original was produced during a period in American history where there was optimism in modernity and that the government could solve all of the nation's problems whereas the remake was produced during a period of when the nation was searching for a recovery from the nation's ills, but still greatly pessimistic. Both attitudes were undoubtably cultivated by their respective medias and often to cross purposes. The reason for bringing up what seems like something completely extraneous is that those overwhelming societal attitudes and the need for commercial films to be a part of them, is what colors both films. Unfortunately for the original, the societal attitudes prevailing at the time of its making are not apropos to the film's storyline. Bogart and Bacall, always optimistic, and delivering their lines with the great relish that can be the product only of a fawning, patronizing industry that so over indulged it's stars, like geese being prepared for fois gras production, that all of their actions seem either ridiculous or villainous in light of the events of the story surrounding them. And the story does surround them, or they the story. I don't think that Michael Winner, the brilliant director that he is, could have gone back in time to rectify the faults in the mess Bogart/Bacall created.\nWhat Winner had to work with is an actor who successfully made the transition from the histrionic acting style prevalent in the '30's and '40's to the more realism based style adhered to today. I couldn't sanctify Mitchum though, at times he seems too laconic, and maybe someone like Jack Nicholson would have been a better choice what with his very good job in Polanski's Chinatown.\nWinner is the perfect choice for director of this depressing story from pot boiler writer Raymond Chandler. Chandler suffered the same faults as Bogart/Bacall; being unable to see what he was doing and thinking only of where what he was doing would put him. So what Winner has done is to take his own '70's recessional attitude and bring out the great negativity in a story that was written by Chandler as the kind of novel you'd buy  at a bus stop, read on the bus, chuck in the garbage when you got to your destination and walk away feeling good about the whole experience and not remembering anything else about it.\nBesides Mitchum, the rest of the cast is pretty good too. I'm sad to write that Jimmy Stewart didn't make it, neither the transition to Hollywood's new style of acting nor does his character, sort of. In his scenes with Stewart, Mitchum's reverence for the aging Stewart shows through a bit, and maybe Mitchum should have let his guard down more during some of the more shocking scenes.\nI guess it depends on your priorities, time, money, or what you hold dear, in deciding which version to watch.",

Winner decided to move the location from 30's LA to 70's London, which might seem odd. Plus, Winner was able to blag many of his friends into appearing in the film, maybe for next to nothing. Private detective Philip Marlowe (Robert Mitchum) is approached by General Sternwood (James Stewart), to find out who has been blackmailing Sternwood, Marlowe also meets the General's daughters Charlotte (Sarah Miles) and Camilla (Candy Clark). The latter is later found at the house of pornographer Arthur Geiger (John Justin), where Geiger is found murdered. Marlowe's investigations take him to Geiger's employee Agnes Lozelle (Joan Collins), her corrupt boyfriend Joe Brody (Edward Fox) as well as gambler Eddie Mars (Oliver Reed), who owned the house Geiger lived in. It's a complex case, but Marlowe suspects the daughters... It's quite faithful to the original book, but moving it to the UK for financial reasons does seem a bit redundant, however it is a dark, moody film with a huge all star cast, but seeing as Mitchum had just played Marlowe in Farewell, My Lovely (1975), set in LA in the 1940's. It does seem odd to play the same character here,",

However, casting takes a strange turn in the form of Sarah Miles and Candy Clark as the Sternwood daughters - Clark is like a deranged oversexed Muppet, and Miles lacks the smoldering sexiness of Lauren Bacall.

If I was overanalysing I would go so far as to say it was an entirely misogynostic take on the book - the women are all porno cliches stripped of any charm and playfulness.

However, unlike FAREWELL, this BIG SLEEP moves Marlowe from L.A. of the 1940s to London in the 1970s. This dramatic shift to the story works surprisingly well, as the different setting gives the film a unique angle. Unfortunately, the film has very little by way of style, and like the previous film, looks like a TV movie. Director Winner relies too heavily on voice over and flashbacks, not to mention the pedestrian-at-best supporting cast. Sarah Miles is a serviceable Charlotte Sternwood (her name inexplicably changed from Vivian in the novel) and Candy Clark is pretty abysmal as Camilla Sternwood (her name also inexplicably changed from the novel) - neither, too, exude the dangerous sexuality both characters need to make them convincing. It's also heartbreaking to see an ailing James Stewart as General Sternwood.

It should have been a contender - Robert Mitchum had been ideally cast as Philip Marlowe in 1975's Farewell, My Lovely and he is surrounded here by some high calibre talent. But British director Michael Winner so messes up the script, the direction and the mis-en-scene that the film is the very definition of poor. At times it looks as though someone has conned a load of old actors into performing in their home movie shoot. Perhaps this film is a joke on the cast, many of whom were old enough to be heading for \"the big sleep\" itself and so were the butt of Winner's sick joke.\n\nMitchum walks through the film without shaming himself too much (although he shouldn't run or fight at this age); some of the other actors give the worst performances of their career: James Stewart is beyond self-parody as the dying General; Sarah Miles lolls her tongue whilst sporting an afro perm (!), Richard Boon grimaces and growls to entirely comic effect and Candy Clark does the kind of acting one expects to see in an early John Waters film - a kind of mickey-take of acting - which is funny when Waters' cast does it deliberately but embarrassing when Clark (a promising actress previously) does it for supposedly serious effect here. A couple of the English actors, such as Richard Todd and John Mills, acquit themselves with dignity, although Edward Fox is hilariously bad in his scenes, plummy accent chewing words to pulp. Any film where Joan Collins gives one of the most convincing performances has got to be going wrong somewhere...\n\nWinner's script is a dog's dinner. He sets up the expectation that he's going to follow the convention whereby we only see and find out what Marlowe sees and finds out (a staple of detective films) and the adds random cutaways to events which Marlowe was not present at - e.g. the car going into the Thames - as well as plonking a lot of mismanaged flashbacks into the action every time anyone begins to talk about what has happened in the backstory. As usual with Winner, the film is cut with the finnesse of a village butcher, and setting the grimy noir in the poser areas of London and the English countryside does nothing to conjure the seamy world of the book.\n\nAll in all, a pretty dismal addition to the list of Chandler adaptations, but worth seeing for the unintentional laughs (there are plenty) and as a lesson in how not to make a film, or what parts not to choose when you're an ageing actor.",

The acting is rather awful in parts, and the 1946 film doesn't feel like it's really aged, yet this one from 1978 feels really dated. The music is awful, the sets are so seventies it looks like something the BBC would of made such as Are You Being Served. Why is it set in London? \nI couldn't help but compare this to the Bogart/Bacall version, but of course they altered the story in that one because they wanted to have more Bogart/Bacall scenes ('that depends on who's in the saddle'). This one lacked the witty by-play of the original. Robert Mitchum did not have the charisma of Bogart and without a Lauren Bacall to play against, the film just walks through each page of the book, with very little effort or energy.They did make the sequel to this (Farewell My Lovely) which is why I wanted to see this version because I'm about to read the book of Farewell My Lovely and I thought I'd probably want to see the film version.",

Although the shift in location from the U.S. to London doesn't hurt the film much (in fact, it adds somewhat of a Hitchcockian aura), this is not even comparable to the wonderful examples of film noir in the earlier era.\r\n\r\nI suspect some of the greatest faults stem from Mitchum trying to maintain his own characterization of Philip Marlowe, while seeming too aged for the role (and certainly not a capable replacement for Bogart); the use of pornographic elements to create interest (although main points lifted from the novel, they're more of a distraction here, really); and the casting of Stewart as the General (Stewart's a pleasure to watch, but cannot really fit the role of a cynical, almost nasty, old man).  I miss the classic \"introduction\" to the characters from the 1946 version, which includes a sweltering greenhouse (in this film, although the greenhouse was presumably humid, both Mitchum and Stewart looked immaculately dry).  I also did not find either of the Sternwood daughters alluring or memorable in the Bacall-way.  Although we are not supposed to actually love any of these characters, we aren't supposed to be so repulsed by them, either.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, this version is a disappointment.  Stick to Raymond Chandler's novel and the Bogart-Bacall film.",
