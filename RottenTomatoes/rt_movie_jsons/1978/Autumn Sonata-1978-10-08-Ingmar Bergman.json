    "summary": "After a seven-year absence, Charlotte Andergast (Ingrid Bergman) travels to Sweden to reunite with her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann). The pair have a troubled relationship: Charlotte sacrificed the responsibilities of motherhood for a career as a classical pianist. Over an emotional night, the pair reopen the wounds of the past. Charlotte gets another shock when she finds out that her mentally impaired daughter, Helena (Lena Nyman), is out of the asylum and living with Eva.",

            "content": "1978 Tragic Family Drama: \"I wonder whether I've lived at all. Is it the same for everybody, or do some people have a greater talent for living than others? Or do some people never live? They just exist.\"\n2022 Millennials/Gen X: \"Honestly bro same.\"\n\nSomehow the only collaboration between legendary Swedish director Ingmar Bergman and equally legendary Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman (no relation), Autumn Sonata was not immediately hailed as a masterpiece by contemporary audiences, and it's somewhat understandable why - it combines more active dialogue (abandoning the lingering empty space that the director often used to great effect in the past) with a subjectively restrained visual composition (nearly all of the scenes take place in relatively nondescript Swedish houses). The film relies almost entirely on the dynamic between its two main characters, Ingrid Bergman's Charlotte and Liv Ullmann's Eva, a mother and daughter who gradually revisit the unresolved trauma of their pasts in a way that they had found more convenient to gloss over or forget. The brilliant aspect to their discord is that it feels organic and real while exploring (i.e., an actual conflict) while touching on two characters that are simultaneously flawed yet completely relatable. Charlotte represents personal ambition and self-fulfilment (at the expense of a sense of indifference and selfishness) while Eva is an embodiment of childhood trauma, an existence that didn't ask to be created before being left to fend emotionally for themselves (recognizing the limitations in holding onto the past, but unable to let go). \n\nThese are characters built on basic human principles and are executed well both in the screenplay and in front of the camera with top-notch performances, and they largely succeed in conveying the principles of basic human weakness and irreconcilable intergenerational differences. My only complaint (if you can call it that) about Autumn Sonata is that it feels very much like a cinematic adaptation of a theatrical play, even though the domestic discord source material doesn't necessitate any grand flourishes (and is likely better for not including any). Overall, still a very good component of the filmography of both Bergmans, which remains thematically sharp as all sincerely human dramas tend to. (4/5)",

Time can only cause them to internally exacerbate, until they become unendurable. In Autumn Sonata, these wounds are of maternal apathy and callousness. Turning a blind eye to them in hope (or rather in belief) of them fading away with the passage of time as if they were merely bitter childhood memories would only further deepen and engraving them into the growing psyche, later coalescing into a distorted identity on the verge of collapse once the past unfolds, and grieving is the catalyst for that.\n\nThe theatrical origins of monologues writ large no matter how cinematically delivered and presented. We, cinephiles, used to look past this. Here, monologues are completely shorn of their theatrical quality, resulting in some of the most achingly realistic, gut-wrenching movie scenes ever. Autumn Sonata is a provoking and emotionally-draining drama.",

            "content": "Wow, what a beautiful countryside there in Norway with all the rolling mountains bordering the lake. Wow, the mother really likes to talk about herself and make everything about her. She puts on a good show, but it's going to be really interesting to see if she really gets sentimental and breaks down and cries. I think mother's problem is that she swats away any sort of emotions, not letting herself feel sad or grieve or even mourn. It feels Eva wishes she was like her mother and her mother wishes that she could feel like Eva does. It's weird because they're mother and daughter, yet it seems like they are strangers to each other at times. It's almost like they can't be real and genuine in front of each other. They have walls up that neither of them are trying to break down. All Eva wanted was to feel love and care from her mother, but she was too busy with her piano and being somewhat selfish. The mother seems to be going around in circles with her past experiences but really what she needs to do is say she's sorry, and mean it. Sorry for leaving Eva and dad so often, sorry for neglecting Eva, sorry for not showing the love that Eva deserved. I think the worst part is the mother doesn't want to take responsibility, she's in denial. Almost like she doens't want to come to terms or is deluded that she didn't affect Eva's life and upbringing. It's crazy how Eva stripped her mother down with words, telling her everything she felt. It's so sad to see how hurt Eva is and how she basically has to be the mother in her situation taking care of Helena and talking so bluntly to her mother so that she can realize how badly she fucked up. The mother ran away like she always does, but now she knows how her daughter feels which now will make her suffer in guilt, in darkness and in emptiness knowing the pain and torment she caused to her two daughters out of neglect. Even with the daughter basically telling her that she was evil, she still wants to try to mend things and wants to make things better with her mother. But it's difficult when the mother doesn't want to come to terms with what she's done, she does brushes it aside and runs away - the one thing she's good at doing. So now the mother is going to live with this suffering for the rest of her life until she comes to terms with what she's done and says sorry. \n\nJeez this movie is melancholic as fuck. Quite depressingly real and raw. I thought it was a very interesting and realistic look at a the troubled relationship between a mother and daughter. This movie affected me on a very deep level and made me appreciate how good my relationship is with my parents. I thought the acting was powerfully done and honest. The dialogue was very smartly written, especially between the mother and daughter. It kept me in a trance and made the movie go by very quickly. Bergman is a visual genius and also the master of sadness. I'd watch this movie again when I wan't to be reminded of my relationship with my parents.",

            "content": "A sincerely astonishing picture displaying familial struggles.\n\nIngmar Bergman's Swedish drama Autumn Sonata (1978) is a pensive reflection on life's relatable tensions between neglectful, narcissistic parents and their traumatized, depressed children. Ingmar Bergman is Sweden's greatest director, a visionary auteur with boundless creativity and heart to his beautiful arthouse films. Autumn Sonata is one of his most grounded with realistic emotions and vivid artistry. His direction is so striking for Autumn Sonata as his usual grimdark greys, whites, and blacks are replaced with warm Fall colors like orange, red, and yellow everywhere. He purposefully goes out of his way to connect viewers emotionally to this petulantly critical and selfish mother to her sweet, endearing, and hurt daughter. Bergman shoves you into this cozy Swedish home to reveal emotional trauma and pent up aggression over a lifetime of suffering and pain bottled up by these two women.\n\nIngmar Bergman's script may be the most resonant and real writing I've ever heard in a movie. His heartfelt words sincerely try to empathize with each lady through their past ordeals and current attitudes. Bergman writes with an authentic voice as the mind behind these Swedish ladies' troubled thoughts. Every line is full of dejected loneliness and desperate need for affection. Bergman makes Charlotte self absorbed, relating everything anguished heard back to herself and her own problems. Meanwhile, Bergman makes the daughter observe her mother's gluttony for attention as her own thoughts reflect her melancholy and regrets in a kindly manner. Autumn Sonata is fully realized as an intimate piece of art, dedicated to forcing the audience to confront hard emotional truths no matter the cost. Bergman writes monologue after monologue with vast knowledge and maturity gained from a life well lived and numerous brilliant features already establishing his innovative earnestness.\n\nLiv Ullmann is truly amazing as the daughter Eva full of sorrow over her terrible mother's toxic parenting and negligence. Her hurt eyes display deep sadness with every hateful glance at her mother. Ullmann brought tears to my eyes as she cried over her lost childhood and misgivings about her mother's coldness. Ullmann performs long speeches of emotional catharsis with a piercing gaze and perspective clarity. Liv is still stunningly beautiful and sweetly gentle as Eva. Liv Ullmann is up there with all of Sweden's greatest actresses like Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo, Bibi Andersson, and Rebecca Ferguson for her delightful realness and subtle dramatic acting prowess. I am in awe of Liv Ullmann's stark reality in her role as Eva in Autumn Sonata.\n\nIngrid Bergman is fantastic in her final film role as Eva's wretched mother and classical concert pianist Charlotte Andergast. Bergman is entertaining as she complains about everything and everyone around her. Furthermore, Ingrid Bergman is devastating as her character Charlotte is incapable of relating to her daughter sincerely as she cannot express any real emotion. Her breaking down is so gripping, like Ullmann's captivating lead performance stuffed with subtle pain, while Ingrid is outlandishly garish and mean in her criticisms. She gives Charlotte nuance and complexity, while remaining fully tacky as the cruel mother no child could love. I'm glad Ingrid Bergman finally got to act in Sweden's cinematic master Ingmar Bergman's classic pictures.\n\nLena Nyman is heartbreaking as the physically wheelchair bound daughter Helena with her agonized screams, longing to receive any genuine love or actual warmth from Ingrid Bergman's deviously apathetic maternal figure. Halvar Bjork is surprisingly sweet and quite patient with the rare nice husband in Ingmar Bergman's work. Gunnar Bjornstrand cameos at the end as Charlotte's manager Paul, but he merely nods and laughs. It was cute of Ingmar Bergman to cast his and Liv Ullmann's real daughter Linn Ullmann as the unhappy young Eva.\n\nI have to mention Sven Nykvist's gorgeous cinematography for Autumn Sonata. He makes everything warm with Fall vibes cozy Autumnal colors. His camera framing is strikingly symmetrical. He juxtaposes faces ready to burst into tears with brilliant close-ups. All his wide shots depict isolation in this snug Swedish abode. Sylvia Ingemarsson's editing is brilliant with hard cuts to past events. She gives Autumn Sonata an eerie atmosphere and dreamy mood. Ana Asp's production is cute and clever with her stately Swedish design method. Inger Pehrsson's costumes are stylish and pretty, especially Liv Ullmann's green dress. I adore the score within Autumn Sonata as Ingmar Bergman picks Schumann, Bach, Chopin, and Handel's classical compositions. They give Autumn Sonata an air of regality and more warmth than any previous Ingmar Bergman motion picture.\n\nIt's a shame that Autumn Sonata was Ingmar Bergman's final theatrical release, but I guess he left everything he had to say on the silver screen. I appreciate him getting Ingrid Bergman to play on screen with Liv Ullmann. I thank Ingmar for his stalwart service to cinema.",

            "content": "This is the first Ingmar Bergman I have watched and the words that come to mind to describe this film are internalise, talkative and prolong.\n\nThe characters portrayed in this film are stoical and repressive. The two main characters in the film are Charlotte (Bergman), the mother of two daughters, one of them being the other main character; Eva (Ullmann). Eva's husband Viktor (BjÃ¶rk) and her sister Helena (Nyman) round out the supporting cast. Firstly, the acting in this film is brilliant from all involved. Ullmann's emotionally reclusive character is splendidly portrayed. Her solemn acting subtly shows the emotional weight Eva carries with her relationship with her mother and, to a lesser degree, her husband. Her crescendo-like performance is fully realised at the climax of the film. Bergman captures Charlotte's superior demeanour towards her daughter and her isolated and lonely attitude effectively. The character's selfish care free attitude is displayed subtly by Bergman eventually coming to a head at the climax of the film. The script is written well, but more time could have been given to the mother's point of view. Some of the daughter's accusations sometimes seem unfounded. There are too many threads in the film with feeling unresolved. The direction of the film is very good, especially in scenes where there are no edits and the scenes are just Bergman and Ullmann delivering their lines for more than five minutes. Ingrid Bergman was deservedly nominated for Best Actress, but lost to Jane Fonda for Coming Home. Out of the Best Actress nominees I saw for that year (Fonda, Bergman & Clayburgh), I believe Bergman was the best performer (the Academy in my view probably gave Fonda a \"career\" Oscar).",

This movie does have some of the pacing issues that I struggle with in other Bergman films. However, one of the advantages I see in Autumn Sonata is that it doesnâ€™t revel in silence. Instead people will talk to themselves or even directly to camera in order to keep you invested. I appreciated that, and I never got bored with Autumn Sonata. I have to give a lot of credit to remarkable performances from Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman. The movie would be almost unwatchable for me with lesser actresses. This is a style of movie I feel like I should despise, because I always hate when there is nothing but bickering for hours, but this was something different. It was a fracturing of a relationship between mother-and-daughter, it was a revelation of past pains, and it was devastating to watch. Every moment of the climactic scene in this film was heart-wrenching and powerful. I was enthralled and could not look away for even a moment. It didnâ€™t make Autumn Sonata into something that I loved, but it was a scene that I will never forget.

However, in the last film is not sketched any nostalgia, on the contrary, it is a reunion there are several characteristics that marked the famous Swedish director.\n\nSuch as his strong relationship with the theater, with the actors, the use of symbols and metaphors, the simplicity of his locations (which he turns into a great advantage), the psychological character in formation and human relations, striking and challenging women , The expressiveness of a face in its close's and big close's and how much it speaks or even shouts moments of silence, moments when not verbalizing suggests so many things. As in the scene where Eva (Liv Ullman) plays a few notes on the piano for her mother, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman), a magisterial and anthological moment, in the force and expressiveness of two actresses who say nothing on the scene but suggest a universe Of rivalries, misunderstandings and anguish in a (non) relation of mother and daughter.\n\nAutumn Sonata \"is a tragic burden of human emotion, and is mostly a drama of confessions between two women, who dialogue with each other, which ends up generating a certain monotonous production noise, especially by the subtle clash of the Seem to dominate much of the film, which may have been elaborated in an attempt to generate a frenzy in the audience for the climax, which is not necessary or even does not work, because in the invitation letter written by Eva and In the opening monologue performed by Eva's husband, it is already clear that there, it will be a place to settle accounts.\n\nIn addition to its musical allusion, the film's title keeps track of another central point: the idea of ?? seasons and cycles. It is clear the reference of this change of seasons in the photograph of Sven Nykvist who collaborates with his pale and washed palette and without great dependences of the artificial light, lamps and candles, call attention to the cold of the winter. However, in what seems to be a contradiction, many of Nykvist's scenes are garlands with flowers. They appear in dozens of scenes. Normally associated with spring, the presence of flowers is a clear reminder of the cyclical nature of life and our relationships with others. The cold will pass, suggest the flowers, we only have to endure this during the winter.\n\nFilled with distressing emotion and agonizing eyesight, \"Autumn Sonata\" offers a methodically potent examination of the pain we choose to keep inside, and the scars that remain with us as a result. Like most Bergman films, the image is replete with existential questions and gloomy reflections, deeply investigating the mysteries of the challenges inherent in life, and depending on the interpretation, the ending may offer some level of optimism and catharsis, the film's elegiac mood And almost impossible confessions of hating and indifference remain irrevocably haunting.\n\nAnother feature that Bergman has always been able to use, was his complete understanding that in the end, a film ends up always being the actors, they are the face and the memory of the film and they have the capacity to generate reciprocities with the public. So, Bergman is undoubtedly the director, but in the end, are Liv Ullman, Ingrid Bergman and Lena Nyman who play the Sonata.",

There is something about his films that appeals to me, so few are the times when I really don't like something he did(\"Tystnaden\",\"Through a glass darkly\" and \"Vargtimmen\" are the \"exceptions\"). Apart from this, before Tarantino gave it a modern spin or Woody Allen used it in his comedies, Bergman and Tarkovsky were the two directors that mastered the art of writings insightful dialogues and monologues. Because this is what shines in most of Bergman's films, since more often than not, he was a minimalist so as much as you could admire Sven Nykvist's camerawork, there is little much else to admire from an aesthetic standpoint.\n\nSomehow, Bergman appeals more to me than Tarkovsky does, at least in terms of dialogue: Tarkovsky is a bit too \"sweet\" for my liking.\nThere are two other aspects: one of them is linguistic and the other revolves around performances. \nI have seen other Swedish films as well(\"Let the right one in\", \"The girl with the dragon tattoo\" etc) yet in none of them have I found the Swedish language so appealing. In Bergman's films it has a particular melody almost tailored to fit their gloomy atmosphere.\n\nAlso, in terms of performances there is a contrast between what those performances depict and how they depict it(sometimes) and this is something some directors could learn from Bergman: sometimes moments of great emotional impact are best delivered in a cold manner and I am targeting especially those sappy melodramas in which the \"dramatic\" performances are laughable instead of dramatic. \n\n\"Autumn Sonata\" fits best the description above, so I can't really say much else.",

Charlotte Andergast (Bergman) is a renowned pianist who recently lost her companion Leonardo (LÃ¸kkeberg), so she accepts the invitation to stay with her eldest daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) and her husband Viktor (BjÃ¶rk) for some time, whom she hasn't seen for seven years.\ncontinue reading my review on my blog: http://wp.me/p1eXom-1B3",

For some people, they had a happy childhood with no complaints, and this will all sound very foreign and probably overly dramatic. Other people had varying degrees of unhappiness in their childhood, and for those people Autumn Sonata will either hold up as a mirror to conversations they've had with their own parents, or resemble something they wish they could discuss.\n\nAutumn Sonata is the confrontation between a daughter and her mother. It's raw, inconsistent in the way real people are inconsistent, and shakes with bristling questions that go unanswered.\n\nAnd the movie creaks under the weight. At least for me, having heard these conversations between my father and his parents, everything here is painfully realistic. Or, the beginnings of something painfully realistic. These are good stepping-stone conversations. Essential conversations to rebuilding a relationship.\n\nBut what the film misses is a chance to explore the mother character much more deeply. She touches a bit on her childhood, and it sounds much like you'd expect based on her parenting style. (Or lackthereof, if you will.) But these dysfunctional issues flow pretty specifically from generation to generation. After all, if you grow up in a specific family dynamic, that is often your default reaction when placed in the parental role. (And if you're consciously trying to be not-that-parent, you might correct some issues, but not others, and go too far in correcting even other issues, creating a whole new problem.)\n\nSo what Autumn Sonata could have done to really make it a powerhouse would be to better showcase the generational links.\n\nRegardless, this is a film that I definitely would not consider fun to watch. But it is a very good film that tackles issues I rarely seen addressed in cinema in a realistic way.",

The Bergman films I've seen so far all pretty much have great female performances, but in Autumn Sonata (Ingrid) Bergman and Ullmann bring a level of talent and emotional realism to the performances that just left me breathless while watching. I can't say which actress is better - their performances are interlocked I can't really separate them. Now my 2nd favorite Bergman film after Persona (and pretty close to it).",

The story is 'the standard'- existential angst played through the medium of family dysfunction and life's exquisite little cruelties, but no less affecting for it. To love is to suffer, and vice versa. Would that there was anyone around now painting characters in such vivid colours.\n\nTHIS is the real 3D, as in characterisation. There are no easy sketches here. Everyone is complex. Everyone is selfish, cruel, neurotic. Life is unbearable pain, often physically so. Everything that needs to be said is left unsaid until it is too late.

            "content": "Here's a film that affected me deep to my core. The screenplay, direction, performances, and cinematography were all in line to deliver one of Bergman's best. The basic idea is that a mother comes to visit a daughter she hasn't seen in a long time. These two have deeper problems than they want to admit to themselves until things stir up inside of them. Ingrid Bergman plays Charlotte; a mother who abandoned her family to pursue her career as a pianist. Liv Ullman plays Eva; the daughter who of Charlotte who has troubles coming to terms with her mother and her childhood. The two women are legitimately happy to see each other again, since it's been such a long time. They lie to themselves that everything can be perfect; they can look past everything that happened and just be happy to be together. It all starts when Eva realizes Charlotte would not have come for a visit if she knew Helena would be present. You see, Helena is her daughter that she put in a nursing home once she became handicapped, but Eva brought her home after feeling that she would be happier there. And her own mother didn't want to see her. Eva starts to think that maybe things won't be different. We get the full scaled effect when Eva plays the piano for her mother and realizes things are the same as they've always been. Her mother doesn't seem too pleased (even though we see her reaction and for me it's still hard to say why she seems torn up while Eva plays the piano) and it bothers her. It's her own interpretation. Then her mom plays the same thing and it's masterful. I think deep inside, Eva is drawn in amazement to her mother just like when she was a little girl, but she doesn't want to admit this so it makes her angry. When she was a child, her mother would go on tour for months, or she would practice her piano 6 hours a day and never want to be bothered. She consumed her life with her music. This led to neglect, which is why Eva says that Helena has been handicapped. Again, people say that this is similar to Bergman's feelings towards his father. It's set in a country house much like one he grew up in when his father first became a pastor. Helena represents the handicap he felt as a child. Eva probably represents him being neglected by his father when he was consumed with his religion and his troubles to find love. Charlotte would represent his father. But here it's interesting. There's not just one side to this. It's a difficult story for both. When Charlotte gave up the piano she thought she did well by her family. But Eva tells her she was too domineering and the summe when she was 14 was horrible. She didn't like that her mother was always gone, and she didn't like when her mother was around. She doesn't know how to reconcile these feelings. Autumn Sonata is a lot of talking between the two characters. They tell us their side of the story, their feelings at the time, and the outbursts they just can't hold in any longer. It almost seems like Bergman put himself in Charlotte and tried to understand his father a little more here. Autumn Sonata is a flat out masterpiece that's not to be missed.",

            "content": "Though \"HÃ¶stsonaten\" isn't always considered one of Ingmar Bergman's best films, I can say that this is a very very good film that any fans of the Bergmans (Ingmar and Ingrid) should watch. Liv Ullmann decides that now would be a good time to invite her mom Ingrid Bergman over after Ingrid's lover died. The two are very excited to see each other, and though a wound opens for Ingrid when she finds out her crippled daughter Lena Nyman lives with Liv, she accepts it, and catches up on the things she missed considering the family hasn't seen each other for seven years. The peace doesn't last long at all though-- we find out that Ingrid chose her life as a concert pianist over her family, and left Liv feeling miserable and Lena well-- you'll find out later what Ingrid did to her. Liv can't hold her feelings any longer though when she's reminded of her mother's old ways, and the two argue overnight. Woody Allen has said that Bergman is the only director ever capable to capture art and put it on the screen, and after seeing \"HÃ¶stsonaten\", I realized this was the perfect statement for the director. Indeed, Bergman has been artistic in the past, but this is tops. The \"autumn\" from the title obviously derives from the use of color, and Bergman uses only the fall leave colors for everything, 90% of the time, capturing the season as well as the moods Ingrid and Liv present in their performances. Though them and the script can be a bit melodramatic at times, somehow, this film does not end up in the annoying soap opera genre. Bergman gives her last phenomenal performance in this movie (her last Oscar nod came from this, too), Ullmann is heartbreaking in her role, and \"porn star\" Nyman proves she can act very well. All three of these actors should have gotten nominated for an Oscar, and lucky for Bergman, she snagged it. \"HÃ¶stsonaten\" is an excellent late Bergman/Bergman film that is truly worth the time to watch. Recommended.",

One day, the wife and her sisters' mother (Ingrid Bergman), who is a famous pianist, comes to visit them. The mother, however, has many deemons harrassing her and they begin to show. In addition, the wife begins to let out her outrage to how she was neglected by the mother. The pairing of the Ingrid, Ingmar, and Liv yields strong results and touching performances in this sad Swedish drama. All, plus Bjork and especially Nyman, put on fine performances around. One small problem is it begins in the last to heavily indulge in the drama, but that is only a minor technicality. Not Bergman's best, but still a good one. Also like seeing Ingrid speaking both Swedish and English.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman's 1978 film HOSTSONATEN (Autumn Sonata) portrays the troubled relationship between a distant mother, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman) and her wounded daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann). Eva leads a quiet life along a Norwegian fjord with her priest husband Viktor (Halvar BjÃ¶rk), while Charlotte is a famed pianist who travels the world for concerts. When Charlotte comes to visit, Eva is initially joyful, but within just a few hours all of Eva's bottled up emotions spill over. Some remarkable flashbacks reveal the betrayals that Charlotte inflicted on her family while pursuing her career (they feature Erland Josefsson as Eva's father, through in a silent role). As mother and daughter bicker, weep and confess their sins, one might expect a happy ending. Bergman provides something rather different, however, and it undoubtedly will make some viewers furious. Nonetheless, I enjoy the film's observation that in real life, not all attempts at resolution between two people are successful.\n\nBergman has tended to portray priests either as pure evil (FANNY OCH ALEXANDER, DET SJUNDE INSEGLET), or good but very tormented (NATTVARDSGAESTERNA). Here, it's refreshing to see the vicar as a humble, content fellow and a loving husband. Lena Nyman's role as Eva's disabled sister is convincingly played, and the pain Bergman communicates through this part is devastating. The script includes a number of very quotable lines. There's been a tendency to treat the several film Bergman produced between the mid-1970s and FANNY OCH ALEXANDER as minor, but I would rank HOSTSONATEN among his best work.",

            "content": "The Only Double Bergman Film  \r\n\r\nIn a lot of negative reviews, I tend to say things like \"while I have no problem with movies that are just character studies . . . .\"  Or whatever is relevant to my problem with the movie.  I read a defense today of [i]Jeanne Dielman[/i], which I hated, and this shares some of that movie's slow nature.  What it has, however, is a raw emotional force.  These are women in pain.  They have been suffering for many years, each thinking they are contributing to the other's happiness.  This, I think, is a theme with Bergman films.  The first of his movies that I saw was [i]Cries and Whispers[/i], also starring Liv Ullmann, also the study of a relationship.  Here, however, she is not reconciling with her sisters.  She is reconciling with her mother, the great Ingrid Bergman, and in true Ingmar Bergman fashion, she is reconciling with herself at the same time.  Honestly, his movies may be best when they're character studies.\r\n\r\nUllmann is Eva, the wife of a simple country parson, Viktor (Halvar BjÃ¶rk).  Her stepfather, Leonardo (Georg LÃ¸kkeberg), has just died, and her mother, Charlotte Andergast (Ingrid Bergman), is coming to visit for the first time in seven years.  She has not told Charlotte that her sister, Helena (Lena Nyman), will be there; Charlotte cannot handle her daughter's illness, which is never named but which seems like something in the nature of multiple sclerosis.  Eva and Viktor lost a son the day before his fourth birthday, when he drowned, and Charlotte never met him.  Charlotte changes her mind about how long she will stay with Eva and Viktor because she cannot stay in the same house as Helena.  And then Charlotte wakes from a nightmare, and Eva runs to comfort her.  And the two women talk, each telling the other all the things which haven't been said in all the lost and empty years.  Things which can never be unsaid.  \r\n\r\nIngmar Bergman believed that the human soul is read, and so it is worth noting that one of our first lingering views in this movie is on a bush of faded red roses.  Charlotte comes down to dinner wearing a bright red dress.  In fact, the DVD itself is red, though I'm not sure why.  But this movie, as with the other Bergman I've watched, is about baring the soul.  It turns out that both Eva and Charlotte think that the other is harsh and unfeeling.  Each reveals her feelings, and there are flashbacks showing what life was like before Eva was married, before the distancing between mother and daughters.  It rapidly becomes apparent that Charlotte wasn't really paying attention to the world outside her head and her music.  She did not notice the person her daughter actually was, choosing instead to shape her daughter into the person she wanted her daughter to be.  And she didn't want the sick daughter at all, of course.  Helena wears no red.\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, Ingrid Bergman's last film appearance.  She was actually old enough to be Liv Ullmann's mother, and Liv Ullmann was not in her first youth when this movie was made.  However, both women are still beautiful.  No, it's not the beauty of Ilsa Lund.  It is instead a beauty which has weathered much.  After all, Ingrid Bergman's life was not exactly a non-stop party.  The years of strain show on her face, but it is clear that they have made her stronger instead of breaking her.  Charlotte seems to have managed more because she doesn't let things touch her.  Eva calls her emotionally broken, and Ingmar Bergman lights her so the lines are more prominent, which I'm sure thrilled Ingrid.  It also appears that Eva is afraid of her own beauty, which is probably why she wears such unflattering clothes and glasses.  I'm aware there's this cult about the beauty of Swedish women, but I'm not talking about wanting to see these women, even in their youths, in bikinis.  They just have a placidity, really, and extremely pleasing features.\r\n\r\nEva now believes that she will never see her mother again.  She believes honesty has now driven her mother away completely.  Viktor cannot entirely disagree.  And Helena is pretty much ignored, even when she's crawling on the floor and calling for her mother.  I do not believe that Helena's illness is psychosomatic.  I do not believe it is caused by her mother's neglect.  But I do believe that her mother makes things worse.  What's more, I don't think having all this out in the open earlier would have kept the distance from forming.  Realistically, I'm not even sure it would have kept Eva from wearing clothing she didn't like when she was younger.  Eva grew up so aware of her mother's moods that she didn't feel allowed to have her own, and it has ended in her marrying a man she didn't love.  And I suspect, based on what happens, that there are a couple of pretty major aspects of her life that she never told that man, either.  Honesty can be painful, and Eva has just discovered exactly how painful.  She may not want to continue the experiment.",
