They can all ALSO be used to describe \u2018Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'. The film follows young Miles Morales who, after being bitten by a radioactive spider (sound familiar?), starts on his thrilling journey to becoming the new Spider-Man! Along the way he encounters several alternate, dimension-displaced versions of Spidey. These Spider-People include an older, jaded Peter Parker, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham (Yes, he's a pig), and Peni Parker (along with her biomechanical suit called SP//dr). The story is uplifting, inspiring, and hilarious, with the message that \"Anyone can wear the mask\". The animation style is unlike anything I've ever seen before. The film looks like a comic book come to life, and it was captivating and mesmerizing to watch. It really is a \"comic book movie\"! I left the theater feeling like I had just witnessed something truly special. The cast and characters were all FANTASTIC, but my favorites were Spider-Ham and Spider-Gwen. The villains were all menacing and intimidating, which I feel is rare in an animated film. The music was also incredible and complimented the film PERFECTLY. In conclusion, \u2018Into the Spider-Verse' is an emotional story about believing in yourself and becoming who you were meant to be, regardless of any obstacles that may be in your way. It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from...you can be a hero. YOU could wear the mask. It is not only the best Spider-Man movie thus far, it's my new favorite animated film and one of the greatest comic book movies of all-time.",

            "content": "Visualmente asombrosa y surrealista, esta pel\u00edcula es una obra de arte por su combinaci\u00f3n de animaci\u00f3n tradicional y CGI. Aunque esta pel\u00edcula fue realizada por Sony, no hay duda de que esta es la que da inicio al concepto del multiverso en la filmograf\u00eda de Marvel, que luego comenzar\u00eda a ser aplicado en el MCU relacion\u00e1ndola con la trilog\u00eda de Spiderman de Sam Raimi, la saga de The Amazing Spiderman, la saga de X-Men y el SSU. Claro que el multiverso empez\u00f3 a usarse en los c\u00f3mics y ahora se usa en las pel\u00edculas, expandiendo la filmograf\u00eda de Marvel de una manera alocada y excitante. Adem\u00e1s esta pel\u00edcula aclara una inc\u00f3gnita sobre que pasar\u00eda si Peter Parker en alg\u00fan momento se ir\u00eda y quien lo reemplazar\u00eda. La respuesta aqu\u00ed es Miles Morales, quien tambi\u00e9n recibe los poderes de casualidad. Incluso tambi\u00e9n nos presenta otro Peter cuya historia sirve para responder que sucedi\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de la saga de The Amazing Spider-Man luego de que Gwen muere, y tambi\u00e9n una historia alterna sobre si, en vez de Peter, hubiese sido Gwen quien recibiera los poderes, al igual que Peggy Carter en What If?. Otros puntos m\u00e1s a mencionar son la escena post cr\u00e9ditos que conecta con la serie animada de los a\u00f1os 60 y la enemistad entre Wilson Fisk y Spider-Man que recuerda a la serie animada de los 90. Esta pel\u00edcula y su secuela dejan abierta la puerta de que todo es posible en el multiverso sin excepci\u00f3n alguna, tal como se ve en el MCU lo cual tiene una enorme importancia en la filmograf\u00eda de Marvel. Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse es sin duda la pel\u00edcula ideal para comenzar a conocer el multiverso una vez ya visto las pel\u00edculas y series que Marvel hizo anteriormente y comenzar este viaje multiversal que para alguien que le gusta Marvel es un hermoso sue\u00f1o h\u00famedo. Mi calificaci\u00f3n para esta pel\u00edcula es un 9/10.",

Who knew an action sci-fi cartoon could be better than it's live action counter-part?!  But the script here is so strong.  It takes you by surprise with it's inventiveness.  Plot wise this mixes together as aspects of the standard Superhero origin story; which is expected.  But then it brings in It's a Wonderful Life and Christmas Carol; where the ghosts of Christmas past so to speak; (in this case other versions of the hero himself; from different dimensions) coach the hero and train him, a la Obi Wan Kenobi, to rise to the occasion of his super hero calling.  It's a wonderful plot; building on the whole idea of past franchise cast members joining the movie as characters from a different universe; or dimension; a conceit cleverly started by Jeremy Abrahams' Star Trek years ago.  A wonderful story and a wonderful cast; wonderfully inventive; great chemistry between the actors; the story consistently surprises you; and you leave the theater definitely hungry for a second course!  I can't wait to see the next installment in June!  Highly recommend!",

I truly believe that \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" is the best Spider-Man movie ever released. \n\nI love everything about this movie. The animation (though it took a minute to adjust to) is gorgeous and unique. The cinematography is breathtaking. There is emotional complexity to this movie and an incredible depth to each character (especially Miles). The \"all is lost\" moment is masterclass storytelling and creates a near-perfect finale.\n\n\"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" showcases why film is my favorite medium for storytelling. \n\nBest Character: Miles (honorable mention to Peter B. Parker)\nBest Scene: Leap of Faith (Top 10 all time)\nBest Quote: \"Anyone can wear the mask. You could wear the mask.\"\nBest Song: \"What's up Danger\"\n\nNote: Stan Lee's cameo is this movie is an all-timer.",

I particularly liked the times when speech from the comic book that the film seems to be set in, appears on screen - this doesn't happen all the time but from time to time and its quite amusing and visually appealing. I suppose its a little bit like the old Batman live action show, with one or two times where noises made appear on screen, like 'bonk' etc.\n\nThis film should appeal to action film fans - although it is CGI, its very fast paced and engrossing and I wouldn't say its entirely meant for young children - it can be enjoyed by an older audience too but would certainly entertain youngish people as well, so its a bit of an all rounder.I very much enjoyed this - I think it's a film that's probably worth a re-watch or two because there's so much going on that it'd be easy to miss little clues and details while watching the main action on your first view. I'll watch it again at some point and see if I'm right about that or not but otherwise, yes, I'd certainly recommend this film as a decent, solid bit of action packed entertainment.

Now these are NOT criticisms...more a warning if you hate these sorts of things or if you or someone you loves has challenges, such as Autism....as the film might really be overwhelming. Still, I'm nearly 55 and loved the picture...and I think most will if they have an open mind and want something different. That DOES strongly apply to me, as I've gotten sick of superhero movies because there have been so many recently and there's a certain sameness about them...but not this Spider-Man film!\n\nThe story is told with breathtaking CGI--with a look that is nothing like any other film I've ever seen. In this world is a young man who sees Spider-Man killed and is also bitten by a spider and becomes the next incarnation of Spider-Man. But instead of taking the time to enjoy and learn about his new powers, this young man finds himself in the middle of a weird apocalyptic occurance---and all the various incarnations from the various universes come together to save the day.\n\nOverall, amazingly creative...there's nothing else like it. This is more than reason enough to see it. Sadly, however, the film loses a bit on home TVs...even big ones as the scale and size of the film needs the big screen.",

If you are a late teenager, you will understand the reason for all Spidergwen's actions. Besides, for old people, there will be Peter B.

This movie is a testament to Spiderman and all the fans who have stuck with him for the past sixty years, young and old. The animation is beyond perfect and the tiny details, the creativity, and the genius of this movie never fail to amaze me. The voice actors are perfect for their respected roles and every line is delivered with such wit. The story is flawless and neatly paced with witty humor, drama, and creative action scenes all in one. But what I love most about this movie is it's unique understanding of our friendly neighborhood Spiderman. It understands what it's like to be the underdog, fighting a battle when you don't know how to fight, constantly failing yet refusing to fall. Into the Spider-verse has such a clear comprehension on what it means to be Spiderman. Anyone can wear the mask because all it takes is the courage to get back up after getting beat down, which I find is Spider-man's most important trait. Spider-man always gets the worst luck and yet continues to fight on because it's his responsibility. No matter what happens, he finds a way to perservere because it's the right thing to do. It was an interesting choice using Miles Morales as the protagonist and I think it made the movie all the more special, telling the story of Spiderman from a different, refreshing perspective while maintaining the heart of its origins with Peter Parker. There is so much right with this movie.",

La banda sonora es perfecta y queda muy bien con el personaje de Miles. La trama es super entretenida y divertida, y aunque parezca que es la misma historia de siempre, tiene algunos giros y sorpresas muy interesantes. El personaje de Miles cae muy bien, ya que siendo un personaje \"nuevo\" para la mayor\u00eda del publico, logra que cuando termina el film te den ganas de ver mas de la historia de \u00e9l. El villano principal tambi\u00e9n es muy bueno, con una historia y una motivaci\u00f3n muy bien contada. Los otros tipos de Spider-man llegan a ser muy carism\u00e1ticos todos y con un estilo diferente cada uno, pero sin dudas se destaca el Spider-man de Peter B. Parker, quien tiene una gran historia detr\u00e1s. La cinta adem\u00e1s tiene escenas ic\u00f3nicas, como por ejemplo la del salto de fe de Miles, la cual por su significado se vuelve muy memorable. En conclusi\u00f3n, una de las mejores pel\u00edculas de Spider-man, logrando un mejor desarrollo de personajes que las dos primeras pel\u00edculas del UCM de Spider-man y contando con una animaci\u00f3n brutal, que la llevo a ganar el Oscar.

Aside from that, everything was fantastic.\n\nVisually this movie looks great, especially with its creative use of camera angles. The action was great to look at, a lot of the comedy landed perfectly, and when it got serious it did that very well. This was the first time I had ever seen Miles Morales and he was a joy to watch, he's written excellently. I had previously seen Gwen and of course Peter, and they were great in this movie as secondary main characters. The other three members of the team didn't get much time to shine, but I think it was better to focus on the main three rather than sacrifice some of the time they got or make the movie much longer to flesh out six different protagonists.",

The messages and ending keeps you on the edge of your seat, with the gripping last fight scene keeping you extremely invested in the movie. You can feel yourself relate and root for Miles, and you can really see his emotions alongside him. Absolute hands down an incredible movie, and my favourite ever. It doesn't delve into the typical gore genre of superhero movies to keep the viewers invested, and can be watched by all ages. Best to watch at home though for a few people, as the effects in the theaters may be a bit too much (especially older citizens). The movie also has some very funny moments that are perfect for each situation, unlike other movies that use jokes halfway through the climax. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys films in general. 10/10. The animation is smoother than water, the acting is just perfect, the jokes land right on target, and the movie in general keeps you glued to the story. Hyped up for the sequel coming out next year. Definitely recommend, 10/10.",

The animation is phenomenal, and is done in a way to make it seem like an actual comic book is coming to life in front of your eyes. This is easily the most comical of the Spiderman films, even bringing in several references to the comic books themselves. The humor is handled very well, and the banter between Miles and Peter, Miles and Gwen, and Miles and his dad, Jefferson, is extremely entertaining to watch. The villain is also one of the best to ever hit the screen, being a villain that you feel sorry for and even begin understanding his motivations for what he does and why he does it. However, I think where this film really shines is in its action, which is done so well and is so fun to watch.

Amazing voice acting for each of these characters as well.\n3. The plot should be all over the place, but the writing and directing smoothly moves you through this movie like you're turning the pages of a comic book.\n4. I really felt the weight of this world and the characters: when Spider-Man is killed, I am reacting in the same way as Miles- watching a seemingly invincible icon and personal hero get beaten by the bad guy. I felt Miles struggles with his dad and the expectations on him. When Miles finally gets in touch with his abilities and accepts that this is who he is, I truly felt for him. Hell, the Stan Lee cameo is even one of the most emotional scenes in the movie: my sister and I were both crying when we watched this in theaters the first time after his death. \nUltimately, this movie is just a Spider-Man fans perfect movie, and this movie is an experience that I will always enjoy and remember fondly, and I regard it as one of if not the best animated/superhero movies of all time.",

On top of this, this movie smushes together comedy and wit to an astonishing extent making every line re playable and analysable. It's also, fast paced and has really well done exposition and has comic relief and the right amount of fan service and great representation and amazing, really well fitting voice actors and i could gush about how close to perfect it is until i die and i probably will.

No disrespect intended to Peter Parker (The OG) but I've come to like Miles Morales' origin story better. Also add the other alternate universes of Spider-Men (and Spider-Women when you add Gwen Stacy and Peni Parker to the equation) and you're in one heck of a ride. You also get to see a various amount of villains such as Green Goblin, a lady Doc Oct, Scorpion, Tombstone, Kingpin and my new favorite, the Prowler (I REALLY loved his design in this movie). Small negative would be the omission of Venom & Carnage to add into this already crazy melee of characters but the movie still did it's thing without them. There is but so much you can pack in a 2 hour movie but I expect none less from Marvel. I'm also grateful Sony had their hands on this one letting the story and narrative of the plot be great, while this probably still would be decent under Disney's supervision, it would've been watered down to make this movie a 4 Star at best.",

But not only did this movie take the risk, we're glad it did.\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the kind of a superhero animated movie I wanted to see - one with traditional animation done in the style of stereoscopic 3D, with continuous symbols of glitches. Personally I consider watching two superhero movies to be the most connected with watching a comic - Zack Snyder's Justice League and this. And out of the two ZSJL feels more like some painting more than an actual comic, so this one takes the cake for it. The speech bubbles, the panel swipes, the colour splashes; everything make this movie look like watching a Spider-Man comic come to life.\nPersonally I'm all in for the diversity in the characters. Normally I am annoyed when diversity is their only trait. When such a character is added just for the sake of existing, it just makes it look like a wasted effort, and what makes worse is that we can't even point it out without upsetting some people. Miles Morales, however, absolutely does not feel the same. The kind of a person he is, the way he turns into Spider-Man and meets the other heroes to learn more about who and what he is, everything seems to come out naturally.\nThe story is very well thought out, which is also another reason why it feels so natural. If I were given to introduce a character and bid farewell to the renowned one, I could have never done it as well as this did. It introduced many different types of Spideys, made us feel emotions for all of them, had us sympathise with the bad guys all the while making us laugh and cheer at the fights. See this is exactly what I'd want from a comic book movie, especially a superhero one. It should not just be, but actually feel like we are immersed into the environment, even though it is an animated movie.\nMy favourite character in this movie was Spider-Noir. He was hilarious as a detective, always talking about everything like it is supposed to be a mystery. He also looked cool, so there's also a plus to that. Then I also liked Miles Morales himself. Whatever the movie was wanting me to feel for him, I did so. As he builds his character development from being a clumsy teenager to the most powerful Spidey, it was a spectacle to watch.\nI really wish to see more of these. Miles Morales is already one of my favourite characters now, so even if in future he slowly replaces Peter Parker as the face of Spider-Man, I won't feel bad about it. The recent PS5 game, if I hadn't watched the movie, wouldn't have received my interest no matter however good it was, since I would never accept anyone else as my Spider-Man. It really seems to be a great time to be a Spidey-fan. I hope it lasts long.",

The only thing with this is that the first movie set the bar so high that I fear to be dissatisfied. It was such a great adventure. It was surprisingly funny. I wasn't ready for a great comedic level. I also adore the animation. It is so original and beautiful. The sort of comic book format was so pleasing to watch by the numerous colors and the round patterns. At some moments it seemed really real and at other it felt so animated and that's what makes it nice and enjoyable. The fights in that sort of animation was delicious! The only issue here is the music choice, for me. I agree that it goes with Miles' character and the town, the time it is happening but, for me, rap music doesn't attract me so it was not what I preferred. To continue the great points enumeration, the story was perfect. Multi-universe managed perfectly with sense and real consequences that we see on screen. And the fact that there is a lot of different Spider-person makes it even better. Remember, anyone can be spider-man and the directors of this film are genius.",

It makes me care about Miles, a charcter I new of, but didn't go out of my way to learn. Besides all of the Spider-People, I also loved the side characters, especially Uncle Aaron/Prowler and Jeff Davis (Miles' Dad). The soundtrack was great. I'm not generally one for rap , and there was a whole lot in this movie, but it fit in with the tone of the movie, both rythmiclly and lyriclly. The plot was kinda generic, but the movie isn't plot driven, its character driven, and the characters are incredible, so I have no complaints. The only issue I had with the movie was how Miles' storyline with his dad was kinda left hanging. His dad tried to confront him through the door, and that led Miles to hug his dad at the end of the movie, but he didn't know it was Miles, so that didn't really give Jeff the closure he needed for his arc with Miles, but maybe thats me digging to far into the movie. Over all, 9.5/10.",

Its achievements are far from lying only in the aesthetic department, another standout feature for me being the the soundtrack. 'What's Up Danger' couldn't have been a more fitting superhero theme to match its urban hip-hop context, and other tracks such as Daniel Pemberton's 'The Prowler' will surely give you goose bumps.\nThankfully this film doesn't suffer from the ailment of previous Spidey films, either. We're introduced to an intricate web of wacky characters (looking at you, Peter Porker) without the plot being over muddled.\nCongratulations to everyone involved in this clever modern classic that exploits the medium of animation to a new potential and shows us just how much more there is to discover in this realm of filmmaking.",

The voice cast all do respectable jobs too. I have no issues with this film, to be honest. I just guess there isn't anything I love about it either.\n\nShameik Moore is good in the lead, while Jake Johnson supports competently in his role. Hailee Steinfeld, Nicolas Cage and Kathryn Hahn, as well as a few others, stick out too. Away from the already mentioned, I also like the music - having already known about \"Sunflower\".\n\nEvidently it didn't connect to me, someone who has zero attachment to the source material, massively.

There are some glaring plot issues (understandable with a multi-dimensional plotline) and a lot of the characters don't have anywhere near enough screentime or interaction with Myles to get the emotional sendoff the movie tries to shove down our throats. However, it is still a damn entertaining movie that got some genuine chuckles out of me at times. And Myles himself is a good character, as is fake Peter. It was just everyone else around them that felt a little flat, which again is understandable when introducing so many new characters into one movie.

Kingpin's backstory could have been fleshed out more to create a deeper antagonist, but we're just given one bit of backstory and that's that. And that's more I can say for the rest of the villains, or, Kingpin's villainous henchmen. But the biggest mistake in this movie is the main protagonist's father. Miles forges a kind of bond with his father by the end, through both himself (being the son) and on the other hand, Spiderman , and some character development took place, but I would have loved to see a lot more. Their relationship is still not where it should be, and the characters have a lot more development to undertake before I can picture their father-son relationship realistically.",

It brings spider man for the first time as an animated feature length film outside of the tv cartoons. The film features astounding and incredible visuals with bright beautiful colors. We see brief references to pop culture combined with hip hop music and the film is a great tribute to black and Spanish culture. Miles Morales is a great character that's charming, relatable, and connects in an emotional level. The story is well written and serves as a great tribute to spider man lore. The humor is hilarious and the film has a huge heart with strong flesh out characters. One of the best animated films in recent years.",

            "content": "I've watched this film around when it came out but decided to rewatch it again recently just because of the new Spider-Man: Miles Morales game. The premise of the movie is simply \"Bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales suddenly develops mysterious powers that transform him into the one and only Spider-Man. When he meets Peter Parker, he soon realizes that many others share his special, high-flying talents. Miles must now use his newfound skills to battle the evil Kingpin, a hulking madman who can open portals to other universes and pull different versions of Spider-Man into our world\". I absolutely adored it when it came out but do I still feel that way after rewatching it?\n\nFirstly, the animation style and 3D models are absolutely amazing! While I do love the Pixar style of animation, this comic book style of animation was such a breath of fresh air in the animated film department. I also appreciate a lot of the aesthetic choices such as having this shaky movement instead of fluid which further makes it feel like a comic book come to life. The action scenes are also animated really well and are an absolute blast to watch as well. Clearly, a lot of thought went into this and it clearly shows in the movie. \n\nMiles Morales (Shameik Moore) is a great main lead. He isn't perfect and is actually very flawed with them making a fair amount of what would be frustrating mistakes. However, the directors succeed in still making us root for him as we can see how much he really wants to pull through for the team. Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson) is another great Spiderman in this movie who is a mentor figure for Miles. He is a person who has been doing this spiderman business for over 20 years and has a lot of problems with his Peter Parker life such as his divorce with Mary Jane. Due to this, he is quite neglectful of Miles but he goes through his own character arc that is done very well. His chemistry with Miles is one of the things that really shine in this movie. Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld) is the third Spider character that appears in the movie and is mostly there to be the competent and supportive one in the group for Miles. The other three Spider characters Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage),  Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and Peter Porker (John Mulaney) are also all very distinct and different in personality which is perfectly converted despite small screentime. \n\nThe cast is also phenomenal, everyone does a great job, especially Shameik Moore and Jake Johnson. There is also some other stellar casting like Brian Tyree Henry as Mile's dad, Mahershala Ali as Mile's Uncle Aaron, Chris Pine as Peter Parker of Mile's universe, Zo\u00eb Kravitz as Mary Jane, Kathryn Hahn as Doc Octopus, Liev Schreiber as Kingpin and even Oscar Issac for a mysterious role that I won't spoil. It's an all-star cast and even though some have small roles, Sony still went through with casting big known actors. They all do a great job. The excellent soundtrack further elevates this movie. Every time the Prowler is in the movie there is this horn in the soundtrack that makes him seem more threatening. Additionally, there are some pop, R&B, rap songs within the movie that all fit really well and gives more identity to the movie and characters. \n\nThe story is simple yet intriguing enough to keep the audience engaged. It introduced the complex multiverse idea but doesn't overcomplicate it to make it distracting. There are multiple villains but the director makes sure the main focus of villains is Kingpin which is a good idea as multiple focus villains will make the plot feel convoluted. There is also excellent dialogue which is thanks to Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman. The jokes all land and the serious moments are heart-warming and the banter enjoyable. It's good dialogue and none feel wasted. \n\nIf I have to give the movie a flaw then I would say it is kind of the Spiderman group dynamic. Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker and Peter Porker don't interact much with Miles apart from being extremely harsh on him. It makes the last moments with these Spider characters not as strong. Miles also just become an extremely adept Spiderman because the plot needs him to be. It doesn't completely feel justified since it doesn't feel like he was provided with enough training to be that good. However, it doesn't break the movie and the sacrifices are understandable to keep this origin story in just under 2 hours.\n\nOverall, Spider-Man into the Spider-verse is still one of the best-animated movies to come out in a long time. I still loved it after rewatching it. It's a fresh take on Spider-Man that we haven't seen before in a movie. If you haven't watched this movie yet then you must absolutely watch this movie. I can't wait for the sequel!",

            "content": "Before I explain what I think of this movie, i want to explain what I think of superhero movies as a whole;\n\nSuperhero movies typically get around 3-4 stars.  They're solid, they are entertaining, but they lack rewatchability and most of the visual effects look the same.  I even think some of the plots mesh together.  The only real reason people come to watch those films is for, let's face it, the action.  That's what a superhero film is about.  There are some exceptions, like the Dark Knight, but for the most part, superhero movies take themselves a little too seriously. \n\nThe reason I bring that up is because SpiderVerse separates itself from the pack.  It does have action, but it also has some very likeable characters and some great dialogue.  There are even some emotional moments; depending on who you are, there are some scenes in the film that will make you cry.  Everything about this story works perfectly.\n\nOf course, the biggest thing that separates this movie from animated films and superhero movies is the style.  Every frame of this movie is a comic book panel.  It's obvious that this was the intent, there are even onomatopoeia bubbles and dialogue boxes in some frames, but the aesthetic and framing of the movie also capture that.  This part stuck out to me because I LOVE comic books and graphic novels.\n\nBut, let's say you're not a fan of comic books or superhero movies [yes, those people exist].  If you are indifferent to that kind of thing, there is still an engaging, unique story, with engaging and unique characters.  The movie also has a great sense of humor, the type of humor that makes anybody laugh and smile.  \n\nIn short, the movie separates itself from the pack with clever writing, but what ultimately makes it a must-see is the stylistic presentation.  This movie is as beautiful on the outside as it is on the inside.",

In into the Spiderverse a gifted teenager named Miles Morales becomes the one and, only Spiderman or so he thinks in his universe, and ends up teaming up with other Spiderpeople from other universes to stop a threat to all of their realities. Spider into the Spiderverse is a brilliant animated masterpiece, not only with mixing in traditional animation with computer animation, but with having many other typical elements that go along with animation such as humor and colorful characters. \n\tSpiderman Into the Spiderverse pays tribute, not only to Spiderman, but to the animation genre in general. It pays tribute to traditional animation by showing traditional animation in the form of a comic book when one of the spidermen in the film whose name is Peter B Parker explains a plan he has to hack a computer. It also gives acknowledgment to classic animation simply by having a classical animated Spiderman in the form of a pig. It shows respect to anime by having an anime spiderwoman and to more modern animation by being mainly in the form of CGI. It gives nods to the original Tobey Maguire Spiderman films by showing some of the scenes from them over again in animation. It also plays the original main Spiderman theme song and features the old Spiderman cartoon that came out in the 60s. \n\tThe film has a fair amount of humor which is also admiring since animation traditionally and perhaps usually is associated with humor. If you notice during the opening scenes of the film when Mary Jane is kissing Spiderman it's Mary Jane hilariously hanging upside down instead of Spiderman. Peter B Parker sees a different version of himself which is not only a blond version of himself but a much nicer looking version of himself if you notice which is also amusing. There's also an inside joke when one of the spiderpeople asks if the spiderpig known as spiderham is legally allowed to say \"that's all folks\" after spiderham says, \"that's all folks.\"\n\tSpiderman Into the Spiderverse creates plenty of diversity with its gaudy characters not only by having spiderpeople that are completely different from each other, but also by having a biracial person play Spiderman, and diversity adds tons of color. Spiderman into the Spiderverse is very different from the previous Spiderman films by being animated and this alone is very gaudy. I would love to see each spiderperson in the film of their own.   Particularly, Spidermannoir because seeing a film of his would be an authentically different Spiderman film. It would not only be animated but also in black and white, and I just may get my wish with there being talk and planning of a spinoff film. \n\tSpiderman Into the Spiderverse is an animated masterpiece that is not only worth seeing, but also worth seeing more than once. I give Spiderman into the Spiderverse a 10 out of 10.",

Free of the shackles of Raimi's live-action post-9/11 America-pandering version of Spider-Man, Spider-Verse is allowed to make something clever out of the whole time-paradox-rebootquel trend popularised by 2009's Star Trek - except here it's deftly handled, gentle and most of all, fun; rife for easter eggs and appropriate fan-service; I for one, actually cheered, when I saw the videogame costume in the lair, and the bubbles and comic styles all just gel.\nThe voice cast is superb, for this reason: they are all great actors but the characters felt entirely like characters, and unlike something from Dreamworks where the characterisations hinge entirely on you recognising the actor's star power, in Spider-Verse I never felt the need to IMDB it half way through, I just felt how real these people were. My girlfriend, at the tease of the other Spider-People, said, with a real surprise and light in her eyes: \"There's a female Spider-Man??!!\" and I realised that I took for granted that I already knew who Spider-Gwen was, and also how powerful it was to see her, and how little I cared whether the Spider-Person was in fact a man or not. In-fact I'd kill to see a live-action Spider-Woman film.\nSo this film is truly one for fans and one for noobs, and that's rare, I think my partner would have loved it even without me pointing out that I owned the Spider-Noir comic book and without pointing out that, yes, Wilson Fisk is that big in the comics (sometimes), or a myriad of little things that I don't know how I know.\nMore impactful than anything for me though was that the final fight, when he's all 'alone', was the most tense end fight in the usually predictable, numbing and inevitable superhero final fights. Whereas by the end of most superhero films, the hero has built himself up to win, in Verse, Miles has only just got himself ready to start, in a film that starts with the actual killing of a universe's Spider-Man, you really don't know what it can do, and with a Miles Morales who has only just found himself, and who's an actual kid instead of a thirty-something-year old actor playing a kid, it's nail-biting stuff.\nI read an article about how the Spider-Man from the start is the idealised version of Spider-Man, the brand version; perfect, the whole of everything, unrealistic, unreachable. And where that Spider-Man could do it all, it takes the team of Spider-People from different universes, each with their different skills to come together and support each other. More pointedly, The Peter B Parker (B for Ben?) is the hero we can be, he's flawed, he has the same problems as we do, he's neither immaculate, nor immune to the trappings of life, he's the flawed hero, and he's from the main Marvel universe. 'Our' universe. I think that's quite powerful, and certainly a bold decision and one we may never see in a Spider-Man film ever again.",

            "content": "'Spiderman Into The Spiderverse' (2018)\nLike the majority of movie viewers, I too thought 'Spiderman Into The Spiderverse was great. I recall when first seeing the trailer, I really didn't know what to expect, nor did I expect it to be as good as it was. With the absurdity of the plot and eccentricity of the animation-style, akin to classic comics as if they were jumping right out of the book at you, this was a risky film for Sony to put out in my opinion, and they lucked out big-time. It only seemed like the logical conclusion to come to in terms of the over saturation of the genre and abundance of Spiderman films we've seen the industry pump out to this day, so why not throw a multitude of different Spider-men and women on the screen at once for a surprisingly good time and embrace the nature of what superhero films have become? Not only is it a great superhero film, but it's a fantastic comedy, with even hints of drama woven into the plot. Also, all of the voice-acting in the film is perfect, (however I did find Kingpin's voice to be a bit too exaggerated and over-the-top) and the fact that they got Nicholas Cage, arguably one of my favorite actors (for reasons better or worse), that really leans the movie in my favor... Overall it's a great family film and action/comedy which I'm glad to own on blu-ray. I think it will easily go down as one of the best Spiderman iterations we've seen thus far.\n\nMy Rating - 8/10",

            "content": "One of my new favorite movies! \n\nI really appreciated how the creators of this movie worked to make it approachable for wide audiences- I'm pretty unfamiliar with the Spider-Man universe, and this movie welcomed me in. And watching this movie, even if you're not a \"comic-book person,\" is an experience. Watching this whole movie feels as though you've stepped into a comic book. The text (in thought boxes and in the backgrounds), the half-tone shading, motion lines, bright colors and lighting, foreshortening and action poses- it's all done so purposefully. The whole thing feels like a piece of art. It's done in such a smooth and natural way that I didn't question it after maybe 10 minutes, but I was still aware enough of it that it would catch my eye with some really stunning details- glass shards sticking to Miles' fingertips, the afterimage within bright flashes, the color contrasts in the super collider. This movie is an absolute visual DELIGHT.\n\nIn terms of the story, there's some really strong character building and relationships, even with a line of humor running throughout. Miles starts as an awkward teenager who acts as though he's got everything together around his old friends, but feels he doesn't fit in- a struggle that follows him through the movie. At the end, he's settled into his new identity much more, but realizes he's still new and has a lot to keep learning. He and his father and his uncle all have shifting relationships of misunderstandings and support and forgiveness, which eventually (mostly) resolves. Gwen and Peter B. don't open up entirely with Miles, but are able to take the next step in their lives after meeting him. And that's another thing I appreciated: all of the \"Spider-sonas\" are human (well, except for Spider-Ham, of course!). Miles is awkward, Gwen and Peter B. are closed off and insecure, and the others have their own quirks and unfamiliarity with Miles' world. It really feels as though \"anyone can wear the mask.\"\n\nA few hesitations:\nKingpin as a villain didn't sell his painful backstory quite so much as other villains I've seen in superhero-style movies\u2014take Disney's Big Hero 6, for instance, where the villain's agenda is similar. (BH6 spoiler ahead) Both Kingpin and the villain of Big Hero 6 are trying to bring back family members they've lost. This might be because of the Disney movie's plot- they show them as a more sympathetic character, and get the audience to like them before making the villain reveal. Still, Kingpin is a (brutally!) powerful villain who poses a very real threat, and his larger-than-life design and acting set him solidly in the comic-book world of Miles' Brooklyn. And after watching a few times, his backstory is a clever parallel to Miles' devotion to his family and his greater sense of \"home\" \u2026and this goes farther in humanizing Kingpin. \n\nI could also see how the soundtrack might be off-putting to some audiences, and it's not music that I typically listen to. Still, I didn't mind it, as it just suits Miles' character so well. And the little touches of him singing along or of Peni Parker working determinedly to the beat of the background music physically place the soundtrack in the movie's world. There's also plenty of instrumental heroic music blended in to add that inspirational tone that we love in superhero movies. \n\nOverall, it's a wild kaleidoscopic ride through gleefully gorgeous visuals, strong characters, a twist on superhero music, exciting action, and a new and exciting Spider-Verse. Stop reading this long review, and go watch it!",

This movie has everything, a solid soundtrack, a talented cast, Incredible animation (well get back to that later), and an inspirational storyline. The film is based on brooklyn new york were are main character miles is trying to get out of his new school, were he has trouble fitting in, when he sneaks out one night to see his uncle eric he is bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers, shortly after finding out he has powers, he gets to meet peter parker who shortly after, is killed by the main protagonist king pin who brings in different spider men from different dimensions which leads to a peter parker from a different dimension teaching him to be spiderman. This movies storyline is inspirational at its core, and will genuinely make you feel like you are spiderman. in addition this movies soundtrack is insanely incredible, each song fits a different vibe, and its truly a trip listening to it. Finally watching this movie is like reading a comic, the onomatopoeias pop up, the characters all look hand drawn from start, and the scenes of the city are colorful and a key part of animation history. overall this movie is a banger 10/10 easily, and my favorite movie of 2018",

The Easter Eggs are practically limitless and leave room for an infinite number of re-watches. However... I felt the movie lacked a truly compelling villain, as we had all become accustomed to in Spider-Man films of the past. Kingpin's motivations were present but his charisma lacked in a big way. It's understandable given the sheer amount of characters introduced in the film, but was a bit of a letdown. I may be biased, but Kingpin is not a great Spider-Man villain and is better left duking it out with Daredevil in Hell's Kitchen. Overall, it was a great movie that deserves its Oscar and the heaps of praise it received.",

It's kind of a bizarre story, but this movie is relevant in a way that nearly all animated movies are not. From the characterizations to the music to the animation style, this movie is fun and youthful and incredibly creative. Everything about it feels fresh and new. If this is the new wave of animation, I'm all in. The premise is that there are multiple parallel universes and a Spider-entity exists in all of them. Plot happens and the universes collide, bringing 6 versions of Spider-Man (some female, one not even human) into the same universe\u2026 or \"Spider-Verse\", if you will. It's a modern concept for a modern movie. Add to that the innovative animation style, and you have a real winner on your hands\u2026literally - this movie actually beat Pixar for Best Animated Film at the Oscars this year, and I say Hallelujah to that. The movie honors and stays true to its comic-book roots, it's a literal translation of a comic into a live-action film, complete with thought bubbles, narration boxes and on-screen sound effects (blam!). I can see why comic fans were creaming their jeans over this movie\u2026 and though it's a comic-book movie for comic-book fans, you don't have to be a fan of comics or even know any of the story or characters to enjoy it. At its heart, this is a coming-of-age story for new character and Spider-Person to be Miles Morales, and his story is told with an authenticity that makes you really believe the character. The writing is intelligent and funny, and peppered with just enough clever meta references to throw fans a bone without being overkill. Then there is the fantastic voice-work! I was especially impressed with Jake Johnson as the older, busted version of Spider-Man, his dry wit is absolutely perfect for the character. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long; two full hours is a bit much for an animated film and it tends to drag, and I got a little bored at times. But that's a small price to pay for such a pioneering piece of work, the raw ingenuity of the film more than makes up for its erratic pacing. This is the kind of movie that a bunch of super nerdy and creative college kids would make in their spare time if they had unlimited funds (and at least a few of them were high). Which, in a way, I guess that's exactly what it is. The film was created by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the geniui behind \"The LEGO Movie\", and these two dudes have their finger on the pulse of the cultural zeitgeist more than any other filmmakers working today\u2026 which I think is why this film feels more significant than your standard animated kids' flick. If you like animated films, comics, or just enjoy watching something different than you've seen before, definitely make this one a priority to see. And don't forget to watch the post credits scene! It's awesome.",

It's funny, engaging, and has a really good story.  It builds to a sequel (or a franchise), which is inevitable in this day and age, however it's hard to imagine the next edition falling off a cliff.  What a voice cast and animation to match!

The trailers did nothing to spark my interest, and even after the great word-of-mouth I still expected something average. Well, not only is this one of the best Spider-Man movies ever, it's one of the best superhero movies ever. It gets so much right and completely understands the character of Spider-Man better than any of the other films. It's original, surprising, funny, and delivers some genuine heart and emotion. The fact they were able to pull this off within a story that's more than a little unorthodox, and just downright weird at times, is an impressive accomplishment. It turns the relatively unknown Miles Morales into one of the most exciting new heroes in the Marvel universe, and also happens to be one of the most visually stunning, and unique, animated films I've ever seen. I don't think anyone expected Into the Spider-Verse to be quite this good, but it's nice to still be surprised by a genre that gets extremely repetitive and predictable at times. If you've been avoiding the movie because it's animated or you think it's for kids, big mistake. Into the Spider-Verse is all-around terrific filmmaking, and deserves everyones attention.",

Into the spider verse has such a good plot that I shed a tear during the movie, I rarely do this, the only time I cried during a movie was when I was 9 and the movie UP came out. The movie has music for every character and the music perfectly syncs into the movie, the music is even altered so it fits into the movie. The movie also creates so many emotional scenes, since it's an animated film the characters emotions are more visually shown (in my opinion) than in a movie with actors. The humor in the movie is also funny, for kids and adults, there is a few adult jokes but it's mostly kid jokes that adults laugh at too.",

The movie went on to receive 7 awards for Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film, Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, PGA Producer of the Year Award in Animated Theatrical Motion Pictures, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Animated Film.\n\nSpider-man Into the Spider-Verse was a very good eye opener from its art style itself. They way they fit this cartoon comic book type of feel into the basic movie is phenomenal. The main characters help give it a more child friendly vibe, but adults should still enjoy the movie through its compelling back story. From the multiple characters this movie won't have a problem keeping anyone's attention. The action never stops but still leaves enough time for story. \n\nThe movie starts off with a slow story, but as the movie progresses it hits you with the main plot. The movie has very little slow moments, but when it does its mainly for suspense moments. The movie doesn't have many moments you can describe without giving away the movie. Even though the movie has a lot of important moments there are still a few moments kids and adults can relate to.  \n\nI think this would be a great movie to watch no matter what age you are. The movie shouldn't be limited to kids as it still has adult-ish humor. The action plus the intriguing story should keep anyone's attention. People who don't like or enjoy super hero movies will definingly not like this movie. It leans more towards the super-hero persona then anything else, but the occasional comedy will help. So, if you are into super heroes this movie is for you. \n\n\n\n",

One positive thing you can say is the movie does a good job showing the dark side of being a superhero when Peter Parker is killed.  However that is nothing we have not seen before.  The movies \"Kick Ass\" and \"Hancock\" have covered this territory.  Also the character of Kingpin is very poorly drawn.  All the time I was on screen I kept asking myself why his head was in the middle of his chest.  Also multiverses and time travel are also two plot devices that have been stretched to the limit an infinite number of times.  While \"Spider-Man:  Into the Spiderverse\" is not terrible by any means, it is in my opinion highly overrated.  ",

The principal character who is Miles Morales is an incredible spider-man, the directors really explained us his motivations and fears. The other characters were explored but with limitations, I think that this is good because we will watch their stories latter. Another aspect to recap is the soundtrack, for me it was unusual but I liked it, it was a hip-hop style but it really fits with the characters, the universe and animation.\nTo sump up I think that everyone should watch this movie because it\u00b4s a new style of animation, it has quality and it was made with love, the directors really understand what does a movie need to become a cinematographic legend. \n\n\n",

This movie has an amazing animation because it makes that you can enjoy all the effects with no problem of the movie and it has an effects specifics for the moments of the movie, the script is another thing that\u00b4s fantastic in this movie because the main character is very similar to the superhero of the comics and this movie involves all other characters that are exactly in the comic, one last aspect for this movie is really incredible is the directing because it makes a good harmony with the spectators that makes you can feel the movie in all the emotions that the movie gives to the spectators. This movie is the best option if you want to watch a movie of superheros that you don\u00b4t need to watch other movies like other actual superhero movies and obviously has enough moments to enjoy the story of the superhero to understand more of the comic world.",

First off, the animation style is incredible, it really blew me away and made it look like an actual comic book. The Sunflower song is very enjoyable and catchy, but it is just a bit underutilized in the film. Shameik Moore killed it in this movie with some great voice work, he was a very convincing teenager who was trying to deal with his new found powers. Jake Johnson was my personal favorite, he brought the veteran presence and leadership that Miles needed, he has a really good voice that fits perfectly with a middle aged man. Everybody else including Mahershala Ali, Hailee Steinfeld, Brian Tyree Henry, Kathryn Hahn, Liev Schreiber, Chris Pine, and Nicholas Cage all were really good as well. The only things that I didn't really like were just a couple of the characters, Aunt May and Spider-Ham. May was in the film for maybe 10 minutes, but she was bland and cliche, she didn't have any depth in this movie at all, and Spider-Ham was just silly, I get that he's a cartoon, but he doesn't contribute really anything to the story accept for a few jokes which all fell flat. Kingpin was done well, and I liked the female Dock Ock. All in all, this is a very fun and entertaining movie with great voice work and a revolutionary new art style that I hope to see utilized more in the future, great story, great characters, go watch it. This is a must see for spider-man fans, comic book fans, and for anyone who likes to watch good movies.",

            "content": "Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse RATING: 4.4/5 This movie puts the last 10 years of Disney animated features to absolute shame. It's crazy how overly stylized this movie is, it really just oozes creativity. The offbeat frame rate is a stylistic choice that really helps sell the fact that you're watching a comic book movie, and it doesn't take long to get used to it either IMO. I saw it in IMAX 3D and at first I thought there was something wrong with the film quality but it turns out it's actually all colored like a classic comic, dots and everything. The movie does move kinda fast but it does take the time to explain all the different Spider-Man characters you're seeing. Interestingly enough, it brings up how long each different Spider-Man character has been doing the superhero thing too. By doing that, you get to see the difference between a character who just got their powers and doesn't know how to use them, versus one who's been doing it for years, or decades, and is a veteran who's seen it all. It's a great contrast, with my favorite being the older, very jaded, Peter Parker that they show in the trailers. He's been around the block so many times that he knows villain plots by heart, so he's very nonchalant about everything. It's a pretty fresh, and funny, take on the character. The star here is Miles Morales, of course, and I have to say he's handled quite well, even his family. If I had to say anything negative about the film, it's that not every character gets used to their full potential. There came a point where I just noticed there were a lot of spider people fighting villains that hadn't really been fleshed out at all. The film could have probably used another 10 to 15 minutes just to doll out some basic characterization to some of the villains, and even some of the spider characters. The spiders all have their own personal issues, but the only one that really gets addressed is the older Peter Parker. Something even happens late in the film that is presented in such a way that it implies something significant just happened. However, the ground work is never properly laid for it to mean anything to the audience, so the moment just kind of awkwardly lingers. Outside those minor complaints, this is definitely a good, you could even argue great, movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen. There's a level of craftsmanship and creativity here that you just don't see in movies in general anymore. The film has a lot of heart, you can tell the creators really cared about what they were making here, and it wasn't just a cash grab. Be warned, you may get hit with some emotional moments in this film, even Stan Lee's cameo was sad, despite it being funny as well. The film has a very positive message about being good and doing good that I think the world needs to hear more of these days. Definitely one of the best films of the year. Oh yeah, and stay until after the credits. There's a pretty clever Spider-Man joke at the very end.",

Although Peter is just barely anything more than the washed-up celebrity stereotype and mostly just made fat jokes. Gwen seemed very Mary Sue-esque.\n-The invisibility power Miles has closely resembles a McGuffin due to how no other Spiderman has ever had anything but web-slinging and suddenly the new one just HAS invisibility.\nA good movie, however not without flaws.",

The plot wasn't good, the choices for the \"other\" spider-men were just horrible, and don't get me started on the animation.  I know they probably thought they were being very clever with the animation, but in my opinion.....it did not work and was just an absolute, horrid mess.  Such a mess that at the climactic ending, you couldn't even make sense of what was happening.  It was an assault on the senses.  I have never before been so baffled by reading some of the rave reviews.  \"The best movie ever\".....Really??????  \"A work of art\"......Really????

This outshines all 5 of those movies and is just as good as the new Tom Holland Spider-Man films. The animation style was great and unusual, taking elements from comic books and implementing them into a movie. They use chromatic aberration to show focus rather than blurring which looks really good and the change the frame rate depending on a character's confidence and skill. These techniques and some others create a really cool effect that may now be visible to the eye, but does influence what is perceived subconsciously. The art choice is breath of fresh air from the usual 3D animation styles. Having multiple Spider-People is also great and shows a bunch of different personalities. Each one is unique and likable. My only complaint is that after 3 viewings, it does get a bit repetitive. There are movies that can be watched 10+ times and I'm not sure this is one of them. It is still enjoyable after watching three times, it just isn't as great as the first few times",

It deserves a 9.8/10, with this film's only flaw being that (due to the constraints of its run-time) feels too quick at instances, however are very far and between...",

I gave it a go and found out how much I truly enjoyed it! Albeit, not a perfect film it is comparable to all the other films. I would gladly watch this over Andrew Garfield\u2019s two films, Tobey\u2019s third film, and even Homecoming to some extent. Animated beautifully, there were some points it made me mad that other animated films weren\u2019t styled like this. The pacing was somewhat rushed, as is to be expected with a film that has more than one protagonist. Nevertheless, if you haven\u2019t seen this movie yet you should. Solid story, excellent animation, and subtly timed and sometimes perfect humor. A rare gem in today\u2019s animated world that seems to have forgotten the appeal of a 2D art style. 9/10",

The writing is solid, though corny at times (though this is to be expected for a kids movie). The humor is very Marvel-esque-- it does a good job of ironically downplaying the stakes. And like the live action Marvel movies, it uses dialogue that tries very hard to make characters seem 'regular' and 'likable.' It is formulaic and takes very little creative power, but it has worked for Disney's Marvel Universe, and this movie has a lot of plot points to get through, so it is understandable that the writers established character likability as easily as possible. There are emotional interactions at points in the movie, particularly with Miles's father, which don't make much sense. They seem like they are shoved in for dramatic effect rather than the natural progression of character arch. But that's enough complaining. After all, this movie seriously exceeded my expectations. All of the Spider-Man variations, particularly Peter B. Parker and Nic Cage's Spider Man, are engaging and provide some very funny moments. Overall, kids and parents alike will be entertained by the story and dazzled by the animation.\n",

The music is amazing and perfectly fits every scene throughout. Not only that but the fact that so much of the music is Post Malone fits perfectly with Miles Morales' life and character within the film. It also creates a very modern feeling that other movies lack. The level of absurdity is great and totally works with the animation and plot. This even allows for some great humor moments. Even throughout the absurdity and fast-paced animation style, the movie still manages to hold onto a meaningful and well thought out spiderman origin story with amazing characters that are incredibly well developed. Even the villain has a good motive with an extreme plan fueled by emotion, a good trope in any movie really. Lastly I will address the thing that most people talk about, a black Spider-Man. I will say that unlike other movies, this movie does diversity right. Miles' culture and heritage does play a role in the movie and is clearly visible to the audience, however, nothing about the plot revolves around his race and culture. He's not \u2018black Spider-Man' but he is Miles Morales, a character that proves to the world that anyone can be a hero with enough determination.",

From the fresh, stylish visuals with those eye-popping colours to the fantastic script, \u2018Into the Spider-Verse' is a clever and inspiring story that's not only full of characters -- including a number of different, lesser-known Spider-men and Spider-women -- who are all very well written with dialogue that makes them feel like genuine people, but also has the perfect balance of kinetic action, humour and genuinely touching drama. Add to that the superb directing, great voice-acting and a banging soundtrack that fits perfectly with everything else that's going on, and it's so very easy to see why this blew everyone away. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this film just single-handedly raised the bar for the animated superhero genre. Check it, you won't regret it.",

I have to say I thought it was brilliant.  There is a fun, action packed story with an animated style that I have never really seen before, visually it looked amazing.

In many ways, Into the Spiderverse is more down to earth than previous Spidey films. \n+ Its visual style, storytelling techniques and flow bear close resemblance to comic books.\n+ You will fall in love with the tried and tested Spidey origin story all over again.\n+ Into the Spiderverse plays around with layers and angles in ways that are surprising for an animated feature.\n+ The animation is so slick at times, that it feels almost photorealistic.\n+ The actions scenes are huge, bold and inventive.\n+ Miles' road to becoming Spider-Man is wonderful to watch \u2013 the problems, challenges and stakes feel realistic.\n+ Nice to see the film populated by alternative versions of the character.\n+ The script teaches its viewers many important things and has real depth.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The livid action scenes are also a major weakness, since they tend to turn into a mesh of colour more akin of a messy LSD trip than enjoyable action.\n- Unfortunately, the movie often falls into the category of childish goofiness that is so common with animated films. The goofiness in most of its physical comedy might not suit all adult audiences. \n- The trippy visuals and over the top action turn the movie into a hectic and childish affair.\n- Mostly boring villains (apart from the reimagined Doc Oc): Kingpin just hangs around for the duration of the film and the Scorpion is just a mindless beast.\n- The alternative versions of Spidey really have no real place in the story, except for Hobo Spidey, and feel more like unnecessary fan service.\n\nVerdict:\nIt does a lot of things right and reinvigorates a character who has been through most on the big screen already \u2013 but it is just too much of the good thing to truly be enjoyable.\n",

A common problem in movies is that a poor use of its characters to make it feel tied in with the main story or making them feel like an afterthought.

It made you, laugh, cheer, and cry at the same time. The characters were well written, and you felt like you understood them and the trials they were going through. There were some dark themes, and the writers were willing to make bold choices about the story. At the same time, the movie had the tone and feel of a kid's superhero movie. On paper, that shouldn't work, but Sony did something right, something that all studios should strive for in their movies.\nI had some minor nitpicks about the plot, but that's about all I can complain about.

The hand-drawn 2D animation is breathtaking. The artist animated different characters on different frame rates.  This is what gives it the fast-movie slideshow look (Kind of like a stop motion movie).  The only downside was Stan Lee wasn't here to see it.  Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse is one of the best superhero films ever made & easily the best spider-man film.  A must see for any spider-man fan or moviegoers in general.  Fantastic!  Amazing!

            "content": "I, like most people, made many mistakes throughout the year of 2018. One of the biggest ones was not watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, because as I recently found out, this movie is not only the best animated movie of its year, but also one of it's best movies period.\nLet's start with the animation, because it was groundbreaking. Watching this movie was like opening a comic book, and being pulled into it. The text boxes and action words popping out were great homages, but the feeling of a comic extends pass that. The Prowler chase down scene, first on foot then on a bike, Peter Parker's plant to break into Alchemax, and the introduction of the other Spidermans feel ripped straight out the pages, but imbued with the pacing, delivery, and animation of a well-executed movie. All of this would be enough to insure the movie was very good, but it gets even better, the fight-scenes are incredible, doing justice to each of it's fighters, without losing sight of the conflict's scope.\nFinally, we couldn't talk about the animation without mentioning the color palate of the movie. The warm of Mile's home and family, the dull greys of his school, the terrifying contrast of the Prowler's dark purple and energy blasts, and the pulsating awesomeness of the fights at the collide, colors in this film seem to perfectly fit the scene, and the characters in them.\nOn top of that the pacing of the story is near perfect, as it balances jokes, exposition, the aforementioned action sequences, and character growth with effortless grace. The numerous plot twists and character reveals (The Prowler, Doc Oc, the Other Spider-men) in this story were really set up well. Kingpin is a great villain, stuck in the relatable rut of trying to turn back time to avoid the horrible consequences of his past, but at the same time, his introduction, in which he kills the original Peter Parker, shows he is a man past redemption. All of the side characters bring the quirky humor, (Spider-Man Noir and the Rubix Cube, Spider-Ham with his Looney Tunes) antics and emotional depth (The destruction of Peni Parker's father's machine and Gwen's backstory) that has made Spider-Man stories so universally beloved.\nObviously, the most important part of this movie, is the character it centers around, Miles Morales, a teenager who is teenager trying to figure out his identity and his place in the world. When Miles first came onto the comic book scene as a half-black, half-latinx Spider-Man, there was the usual outrage of forced diversity, and while all of that has faded away to be replaced with near universal acclimation, one of the best things this movie does is avoid shoving diversity down our throat, while at the same time making it clear that Miles is a character informed by his race and heritage. From the obvious, shallow features, such as his graffiti and the Biggie song that plays in the background as he runs through the city, to the more subtler, deeper elements, such as his confusion as to why his parents choose to stay in Brooklyn, his discomfort in the elite, preppy boarding school he tested into, and his preference of his cool uncle, Aaron Davis who encourages him to pursue his art, to his father, Jefferson Davis, who pushes him to focus on his grades. It's also fitting that first one turns out to be the Prowler, while the latter is a cop. Ultimately, Miles steps up when he needs to, and learns to control his power and be a hero, while finding a way to balance the two conflicting parts of his life.\nThis story, at the end of the day is about growth, and where Kingpin is unable to move forward emotionally, or where Aaron learns the consequences of his life of crime in time to safe his nephew, but not in time to save his own life, Miles Morales, and the new Peter Parker, show how to learn from past mistakes, and confront their problems head on. Jefferson eases up his pressure on his son, and learns to support him in other ways. The only gripe I might have with this movie, is that while Gwen Stacy gets similar screen time as the two main Spider-Mans, she often feel relegated to third fiddle, and as such her character isn't developed out as much, but even with that, she is interesting, complex character.\nIn conclusion, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a comic book brought to life, with a touching story and jaw-dropping animation. Its damn near perfect.",

Like, maybe the best Spider-Man movie ever good?  Is that even possible?  It's weird because it even does things that were terrible mistakes in other movies and does them here in a way that works out with artistic brilliance.  For example, when Ang Lee did stylized comic panels in Hulk, it was confusing and weird.  When this movie does it, it adds to the energy and atmosphere of the film without ever interrupting the flow of the action.  How?  How did they do that?  Maybe because this whole movie is basically a comic book.  The characters look more like comic books than ever, and even the different Spider-Men have different art styles to them, and did I mention the \"bing\" and \"pow\" and \"bagel\" text sound effects and even thought bubbles that will appear over their heads?  This movie just oozes so much style.  And we get so many cool Spider-Men, and so many cool villains, and somehow it never feels crowded like it did in Spider-Man 3 or X3.  Again, mistakes in the past but here it works.  What the hell!  And it does all of this without missing it's emotional core.  Actually my favorite moment in the movie isn't a big action sequence, it's a small moment of all the Spider-Men sharing their experiences of loss, and experience they can all only share with each other.  It's surprisingly powerful considering one of the characters involved is a talking pig.  Really if I had a critique, it would be wanting a few more moments like this.  Also probably more of other Spider-Men, because really this story is Miles, Peter, and Gwen's story and the other three are more or less background.  I would have liked it to be more even, but that might have pushed the magic formula.

I could go on and on about how Amazed this Spectacular Spider-Man is.Will not forget, mid-Credit and post-Credit scenes. Miles' development in the process, and the some of the best villains in superhero genre In Kingpin, Doc Ock(Viv), Tombstone, Scorpion, Prowler, and Green Goblin. ",

            "content": "This has got to be the biggest comeback for a movie studio in the history of cinema!!! Just think about the fact that a little over a year before this masterpiece was released, Sony had just put out one of the worst movies of all time, The Emoji Movie. But, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not only Sony Animation's best movie, but it's one of, if not the best, animated films ever made. First off, let's talk about how beautiful the animation is; when I saw the teaser back in 2017, I was not a fan of the animation at first because it looked too chopped up. That was before I realized what they were going for: an animation style as that of a comic book. When I realized that, then my opinion went a full 180 and I thought that was an awesome idea, and after seeing the movie it really looks fantastic. From the text showing the characters' thoughts to the big letters popping up, whenever something exaggerated happened, was awesome. The voice talent in this movie is remarkable, especially from Shameik Moore and Jake Johnson. Everyone was great, but they were the real standouts in this movie; they were extremely funny and worked well together as Miles Morales and Peter B. Parker. And this movie, has the pure definition of storytelling; you see a full character arch for Miles, as he goes from a fish-out-of-water high schooler to the confident webslinger we know he is. Also the soundtrack for this movie is amazing (as far as I'm concerned better than the black panther soundtrack, which I also love). My only real issues with this movie are tiny nitpicks and they don't affect anything in the movie, so I can overlook them, but I'll mention them anyway. First off, I do think it was a bit on-the-nose that Sony animated their products into the movie (especially with Miles' headphones), but like I said, I can overlook that. Also, Kingpin was kinda cliched and underdeveloped, but it's ok because if they gave him a clearer backstory, this movie would've gotten bogged down in too much exposition, so I'm fine with it. To sum it all up, if Spider-Verse is Sony apologizing for making the Shit Emoji Movie, then all is forgiven.",

And the ridiculous idea that this kid (who has been 'spidy' for all of TWO DAYS, can defeat a villain all the other 'spidys' from all the other dimensions couldn't - and of course has more wisdom than any adult in the movie, was just a weak ploy to appeal to the children watching.\n\nProbably great for young teens, but tougher to sit through for an adult.",

Some wowed me, some were ok, and then there's Spider-man 3... But this movie.... This movie blows them all out of the water. \n\nThe voice acting was incredible, especially from our lead character, Miles Morales. It would have been easy to slack with the supporting cast, but they brought their A game as well, making for a fun batch of chemistry with all of the characters throughout the film.\n\nThe main supporting character is Peter Parker, who is my favorite web slinger (I mean, I grew up with him, what can I say?). His portrayal in this movie was different than the Parker we're all used to, but I loved what the writers did with him. It added an extra layer of humanity to him, and made his connection to Miles all the more meaningful. Spider-Gwen was, as I hoped she would be, incredible. The voice actress perfectly captured her unique personality and edge that makes her so interesting. The other characters don't get quite as much development but we get just what we need, and they're so much fun to follow. Especially Spider-Ham, who I worried would be too silly and turned out to be a perfect fit.  \n\nThe soundtrack was similar to Black Panther in that it gracefully blended hip hop, electronic, and orchestral sounds. This created a score that perfectly fit the theme of the movie, and is fun to listen to on its own. \n\nThe action was great and exciting to watch and I loved how it all looked, which brings me to the final point. \n\nTHE ANIMATION WAS INCREDIBLE\nIt was beautiful to look at, it didn't distract you from the movie, and it was a fitting theme for Miles' story. That's an important note too. This film features several web heads, but Miles always feels like the star of the show, and I feel like that could have easily failed. \n\nI don't know what else to say, it's fun for kids and adults, and it's easily my favorite movie of 2018 (sorry, Infinity War). \n\n10/10",

Come on, they somehow decided to make the Emoji Movie! And now they have squished those together. Also, I would have thought that bringing the multiverse, a very complicated and huge part of comics, to the big screen. The executed it brilliantly. Stan Lee has an actual big part of the film. He inspires Miles to buy the Spider-Man costume and says it will fit anyone. Which is an enormous nod to how Stan Lee likes his superheroes to be any diversity, sexuality, beliefs. He believed that anybody could be a hero. And I liked the memorial of not only Stan Lee but Steve Ditko as well in the credits. By the way, there is an end credit scene which left me so excited for the sequel. The animation was incredible. They used many styles of animation anime, looney tunes, noir. But the main animation they used was a comic book style animation. It was like watching a moving comic book.\n\nEverything that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller produce is gold. They both produced the two Cloudy with a Chance Of Meatballs movies and recently The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part. I would've preferred characters from the comics that appeared in the series like Superior Spider-Man or UK Spider-Man. But learning about these characters from the movies and in my own time, they are way more interesting. A radioactive pig who bit a spider to a girl with a telepathic connection to a spider. They had the basic characters they needed for the story like Spider-Gwen and Miles Morales. Miles and Gwen were played by Shamik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld. They had great scenes together. I fought it was brave killing off Peter. Well from Miles universe anyway. I really felt something. And they barely gave us anything about him. Everyone else's reaction I guess made the moment sympathetic. Kingpin was the main villain. Liev Schreiber isn't a brut sounding person, well in this case anyway. That's what made Kingpins like Vincent D'onofrio fantastic. And I don't recall Kingpins head being in between his nipples. But they did get his strength and size right.\n\nI crapped myself when those jumpscares came. There weren't many. The flow of the film felt really passive and came making it super unexpected. Mahershala Ali is a fantastic actor. He was great and I am glad he played Miles Uncle also known as from the comics, the Prowler. I thought Spider-Ham was going to be over the top because he was quite silly in the trailer as well as Peni Parker. But he didn't go as over the top as I thought. I loved how they incorporated the Spidey gadgets. The soundtrack is more than incredible as well as the comedy. I feel like this film was very underrated. Watch this film now! And if this doesn't win an Oscar for best animation - Edit, they did win. Proving that this is truly a masterpiece and also destroyed Disney's big streak.",

In this case, yeah, im going to harp the soundtrack because youve shoved it in my face five times in ten minutes. It needs to be varied. It needs rock, it needs classical, it needs blues, it needs variety in any form. Btw, most movies go between five and ten minutes between songs, as a minimum, if youre playing the same genre every two minutes its obvious your story is weak. There again, it is weak, because you have no hook to draw the audience in beyond - once again - your annoying soundtrack. I say annoying, again, because theres no variety whatsoever and, again, its alk your listening to. Want to hear a conversation between miles and his classmate? If you can over Notorious Big. Look man, the best movies have variety, no when to keep the music down, and when to blast it. This one doesnt. Juice, with tupac, was full of rap and hip hop, but it knew when to play, and when yo let the story tell itself, so no variety, but at least it didnt shove it in your face every sixty seconds.

I am the furthest thing from a fan of animated films, but I wouldn't deny that this is a film that merits repeated viewings.  As a side note, Jake Johnson's voice acting really ties this movie together for me.  I extremely impressed with his ability to bring middle-aged, washed-out Spider-Man to life.  Don't miss out on this one if you enjoy Marvel and other comic movies in any capacity.",

Spoiler free review.\nThis masterpiece of a film offers exhilarating eye candy, solid voice acting performances, Herculean character development, a soundtrack that is versatile enough to be sad, cheery, bittersweet, intense, nail biting, and chill all at the same time, some of the most comedic humor I have even seen, riveting dialogue, and above all, characters that are relatable in every sense of the word, from the crush Miles Morales has on Gwen Stacy, to Peter B. Parkers sad divorce with his former wife, Mary Jane Watson Parker. Not to mention the truckloads of Easter eggs that this film packs, there are literally over one hundred of them. It breaks my heart that this was the lowest grossing Spider Man movie. People just dismiss this as another cheesy animated movie that has the Marvel logo in the opening credits, and nothing more. BUT IT IS SO VERY MUCH MORE THAN THAT!!! That is exactly what I though when I got my first glimpse at the trailers, also, I would like to mention that this is coming from a guy that has seen and enjoyed both Deadpool movies. Just watch it. It cannot possibly do you any harm to watch it. This movies deserves all the praise it gets, if not more. It has absolutely everything you could ever want in not just a Marvel movie, but in ANY movie, period.\n101% fresh",

Was also very pleased with the adult overtones to the story while keeping it an animation movie for kids, which so many new cartoon movies do so well these days.

Honestly, the first twenty minutes are spent establishing the characters and the world. Even when the plot gets more complex, we never lose a sense of who these characters are and what their motivations are. The cast brings each and every character to life, and the story has real emotional meaning.\n\nIt definitely feels like a comic book, replete with action words and striking animation. While it captures a lot, I can\u00e2(TM)t help but feel that this was overhyped.

Instead, it smashed them to pieces. It surprises, delights, amuses and entertains right from the opening gun. A sharp, witty script manages to nail the goofy essence of the character (seen through a kaleidoscope of different lenses) without feeling forced, hokey or dated. It's effortlessly hip and tuned-in, a tale that understands what's fresh and spotlights that without exploiting it. The plot remains light-hearted and smooth, but not without trials or consequences.\n\nAnd I don't think I can say nearly enough about the dynamic, electrifying visuals. They're a shot of adrenaline, consistently vibrant and dazzling, a vivid showpiece that leaps straight from page to screen without sacrificing any of the clever little quirks and format-conscious tricks that always seemed so inseparable from the printed medium. Into the Spider-Verse is the first time a big comic book adaptation has really worn those funnybook roots as a badge of honor, something to be respected and embraced, rather than an embarrassing blemish. It understands what makes a good comic tick, values those singular traits and uses them to improve the entire production. I didn't realize how much I needed something like this.",

It means this one is great, and there are others that are great, also.\n\nThere is one scene in \"Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse\" that is one of the greatest summaries in cinematic history, one shot that takes the entire movie and shows it front to back, start to finish. It encapsulates all the emotion, all the drama, all the humanity, and tells you nothing about the film that you do not already know. It shows Spiderman 'seated' on the side of a glass skyscraper, edging his way carefully to the very top, facing downwards toward the street far below. He hesitates a long moment, then leaps out into a daring, graceful dive. In that moment, the moment he pushes away from the comparative safety of the sheer glass surface of the tower, the animators captured the entire film, if not the entire genre, because the glass breaks.\n\nGlass is surprisingly tough stuff. Even regular glass would be difficult to break if you were pulling on it, and skyscraper glass is much stronger than regular glass. Anyone up with superhero mythology knows Spiderman can stick to walls. What this scene is telling us so brilliantly is that this new hero is resisting his new life so hard that when he finally pushes himself into it, accepting the risk and danger, that he breaks the glass, and not even in the easy way. And it tells us that even though he is so afraid of this adventure that his fear can shatter even skyscraper glass, his will and courage is stronger still, strong enough to break that glass and propel him into this fearsome future. Massively good story telling, amazing art, and a lot of heart to boot.\n\nThis indeed is one of the greatest scenes in film, and why not? The whole theme of the movie is that this man is one of the greatest, which means he is great, and there are many others who are also great. In other words, anyone can wear the mask. Anyone - a child, a stranger, a person of color, a woman - can wear the mask. You can wear the mask. And isn't that interesting?",

            "content": "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (5 out of 5 stars). Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse proves that after a few times rebooting a Spider man origin story into a movie can never get old. You would think there is plenty of different Spider Man movies done so quickly within the last 15 years. Into the Spider Verse takes a different approach. Approaching the material and adapting the comic book into a movie. With colorful animation and visuals with the word effects or comic book action violence. The movie is spectacular and one of the best Spider Man movies ever. From the help of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the people who did the 21 Jump Street movies and Lego Movies) takes the comic book material and they bring a kinetic energy with the story. The plot follows Miles (Shameik Moore) a teenager who is forced into private school with his father being a police officer and a mother that is busy as a nurse. He gets bit by a radioactive spider. And he notices changes such as having sticky fingers and being toned out. When the Kingpin tries to turn on a particle accelerator which Peter Parker/Spider-Man fails to stop him. He asks Miles to learn to take the responsibility and stop Kingpin. Miles meets other Spider-Mans from other alternate universes such as a burnt out Peter Parker (who is out of shape, careless, and depressed looking), Spider-Ham (a talking pig), Peni Parker (a young girl with a spider robot), and Gwen Stacy (Spider girl). The film does have a lot of throwback references that brings in some easter eggs from Sam Raimi Spider man movies. The film is a lot of fun. The most fun you will ever have watching a superhero movie on the big screen. Director Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman did a fantastic job in adapting the comic book into an animated film. The animation is slick, stylized, and colorful. If you are sensitive to flashy lights and fast paced changing colors it may be a difficult film to see. The characters are a lot of fun. Miles is that type of likable character were you can try to relate too. The villain Kingpin did look a bit cheesy with having a gigantic body that seems very inhuman. But it was a lot of fun. The story and direction runs at a kinetic fast pace energy. And the action sequences are stylized and exciting. Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a great film. Definitely a recommended film if you are into comic books or superhero movies. This Spider Man is a lot of fun. It has a fast paced story, it has action, and the animation/ visuals are entertaining with a comic book brought to the big screen. The soundtrack in the film which brings in a hip hop tone works great with the movie.",

            "content": "Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is one of the most overrated comic book movies of all time. Fans have waited for a great Spider-Man film since Rami's Spider-Man 2; back in 2004. Spider-Man 3 was a massive disappointment compared to a the sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man in 2012 was pretty good, but it wasn't anything that we hadn't seen before from the beloved character, and Amazing Spider-Man 2 was god awful. Spider-Man: Homecoming was really fun and enjoyable, but that film is a mix between two companies; Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios. Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is the latest Spider-Man film from Sony pictures that is in association with Marvel. Into The Spider-Verse was also one of the most skeptical movies of 2018, due to the fact that every Spidey movie after Spider-Man 2 was either mediocre or just plain bad. One the film hit theaters, it recieved a huge amount of praise from both critics and audiences. People loved the directing, the writing, the animation, the emotionally relatable storylines, and the fact that this was the first Spider-Man film directly from Sony pictures that didn't suck. However, I am one out of the very few that did not care for this film. One of the few positives I have with it is that the animation is spectacular and is filled with such a creative amount of detail that you get sucked into the movie. The performances by most of the cast including Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, and Hailee Steinfeld are great, Peter B. Parker is a scene stealer, any scenes with him and Miles together were the best. Miles Morales is an interesting character. \n\nNow lets get on the negatives. This movie has the potential to be outstanding and one of the best, but the aspects to Spider-Verse that destroy the potential are the subplots including plots having to do with Miles's Dad and Uncle's relationship. Those parts take you right out of the movie, and could've been handled much better. The filmmakers decision during the first act with Spider-Man was terrible and they should've treated the character with much more respect. Other Spider-people including Peni Parker, Spider-Man Noir, and Spider-Ham have no purpose to appear in this movie. Wilson Fisk is also a really bad character; which most people can agree on. I wish the film focused more on Mile's character instead of allowing screen time for five different Spider-people. If this movie were more focused on Miles, Peter Parker, Peter B. Parker, and Gwen Stacey than I would've really enjoyed it a lot.\n\nOverall, I feel that Into The Spider-Verse could've been much, much better and hopefully the sequel will be an improvement.",

Miles and his family feel fleshed out, and resonated emotionally. Even Kingpin, in his small time on screen as a villain, has his actions and motivations justified in an understandable way. \n\nThe voice actors all do superb work here, and the casting director really needs more kudos for a job well done. Even a spectacular script will fall flat is the lines are not delivered convincingly. \n\nThe animation and art direction are some of the best, if not the best, I have ever seen. While it takes some time to get used to (I think they are shooting on 3s due to the complexity of each frame) the visual feast more than makes up for it in my opinion. You just have to see it to understand how impressive it is, and it is made all the more so if you are an artist yourself.\n\nIf you haven't seen this film yet, get out of your seat immediately and go.",

            "content": "Every single trailer that was released for this movie stunned me, largely due to the staggering comics-inspired visuals. But I was trying as hard as I could to lower my expectations for the movie, as I was quite possibly sure that a movie with many \"spider people\" in it like this would be a total mess. The reviews came out calling the movie one of, if not the greatest Spider-Man movie ever made! I was still has my same worries; but I was so glad it gained such awesome reviews, for I really had thought the movie would be a critical failure. (I mean, It's produced by Sony Pictures Animation after all!)\n\nFirst things first, the eye-popping visuals I've seen a glimpse of from the trailers didn't disappoint. As a matter of fact, the animation looks even better than I expected it to be. The insanely inventive visual style of this movie is unlike any other film ever made; It's simply groundbreaking! Plus, the movie could have easily felt more self-indulgent than clever due to the eye-poppingly opulent visual style that embraces the aesthetics of its comic-book roots; but the movie's substance is as much as it's style. The action set-pieces are quite staggering and innovatively designed; those of Incredibles 2 really pale in comparison to what I found in this movie! But the quick-frame animation also does something spectacular for the action sequences. It made the action looks pretty fast and uniquely slick.\n\nWhile the movie's unique aesthetic was the thing that made me interested in watching the movie in the first place; the thing that amazed me is the unorthodox and unprecedented way the movie captured the anxiety and panic of gaining superpowers and becoming a superhero. I know it seems weird and quite silly when I say that I felt that I was feeling what Miles Morales felt when he discovered that he became a superhero for the first time! The movie shows us how \"With great power comes great responsibility\" instead of making us hear it over and over. Of course, the visuals added a lot to this point in particular; but it's Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman's astute and extremely clever script that made Morales a fully-fledged, and quite relatable character by putting him in both internal and external conflict. Nothing feels exceptional or new in the character's arc, and you could easily sense the familiarity of the phases our protagonist go through; but the innovative storytelling that enriches the plot as well as the main character made up for that. Although they are not fully-developed and fleshed-out as much as I hoped; The other \"spider people\", are utilized quite well, they fit perfectly in the story, and every single one of them has their own personality, its own character, and that made each one of them adds something different to the humor of the movie, which is, by the way, quite brilliant! That's more than enough for me, especially since the overabundant storylines and characters were my biggest concerns about this movie before watching it. They could have hampered the narrative and made the movie a complete mess like I had expected; but they didn't, and everything was surprisingly cohesive.\n\nThere is no doubt that the subtle humor played an important in making the storylines feel coherent; but the unparalleled realization of the idea of... well, the parallel worlds and the multiverse is really the thing that glued all the different sub-plots and storylines together, and made what seems implausible on paper quite compelling and cogent.\n\nThe villain, Kingpin is, sadly, the worst thing in this movie. His character is underutilized, underdeveloped, and kinda dumb and stupid! It's really disappointing, as Netflix's Daredevil's Kingpin is one of my favorite comic-book villains I've ever seen being depicted on screen. Besides that I already knew his background very well, the movie did nothing but giving us every once in a while a glimpse or a peak of Kingpin's back-story, and hence his motivations, and this was very perfunctory, especially for those who introduced to this character for the first time. Adding insult to injury, the short scenes that concern Kingpin are scattered and annoyingly intrusive. The fact that Kingpin is quite brainless is totally out-of-place. I mean, the movie is way too smart and clever to have a villain like this that kept giving the protagonist enough time to defeat him until the very end!\n\nOverall, Miles Morales has an unforgettable big-screen debut thanks to a compelling adventure story with innovative and clever storytelling, ground-breaking (and hopefully revolutionary) striking visuals and risk-taking animation style, and strong vocal performances from the entire cast. The well-deserved Oscar winner, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is hands down the best animated movie of 2018!\n\n(8.5/10)",

Introducing comic book elements into the film only to switch it up further by incorporating different animation techniques on top of each other later in the film.\n\nAs a comic book fan it is really cool to see underappreciated characters treated with such respect in a big film like this. Cage and Mulaney both do a fantastic job playing two of the more comic relief characters in the film while still managing to showcase what makes those characters interesting. This film follows the character of Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) a fan favourite but often overlooked character in the Spider-Man cannon. Despite most audiences not being familiar with the character the care and commitment to getting him right is commendable.\n\nReally that\u00e2(TM)s what this film is all about, care and commitment. Sony Animations doing a Spider-Man film with bankable stars like Hailee Steinfeld and Jake Johnson was always guaranteed to make money but this film goes above and beyond to ensure that it offers a new experience.\n\nI realise that the way I\u00e2(TM)m talking about this film makes it sound like an \u00e2important\u00e2? film that is more art project than family fun but that could not be further from the truth. Into the Spider-Verse is hilarious. This film has a writing credit from Phil Lord one half of the team behind the Jump Street films and the Lego Movie and it shows. I can\u00e2(TM)t remember a single joke that didn\u00e2(TM)t land and much like with The Lego Movie even scenes that don\u00e2(TM)t feature as many jokes are still very engaging and entertaining.\n\nIn sort: See this movie!

There is an awesome mix of multiple Spiderman which gives you an amazing mix of an animation styles. The visuals are spectacular and it's a great piece of cinema that isn't hindered by being a cartoon. In an age where comic book movies are being constantly turned out Sony was able to put a new twist, while keeping true to characters that already have so much context tied into them.

It was more realistic for a teenager with so much in mind to have inadequacies (control of his powers) and hesitations (the leap of faith) before taking on the suit of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. The plot pretty much developed Miles to become the Spider-Man in the end. Second, the animation was crisp and was an eye candy throughout the movie. I can't explain more about this, but I wasn't bored in any scene which happens when I watch animated films this is because even the simplest scenes are dazzling to watch because of the innovative animations. Additionally, the movie being centered on Miles Morales as the main hero didn't really hindered on shining some light on the other spiderverses' SpiderMen.

I won\u00e2(TM)t give too much detail about the plot, but it all revolves around Miles Morales witnessing an eye-opening change in self, acquaintances, the world and a specific \u00e2universe\u00e2?. Visually, the film is like a comic book brought to life. I know that\u00e2(TM)s been said frequently, but that\u00e2(TM)s what the movie essentially is. The colors and lights really pop out, as well as the action. Every character in this film has a backstory. We understand their purpose of why they do what they do. Even with KINGPIN, the main villain. He\u00e2(TM)s not the most fleshed out character in the film, but we still understand him. Kingpin was my ONLY issue with the film, and it\u00e2(TM)s very minor. Everything else was just unbelievable. The animation is EXTREMELY innovative. The creators of this film really outdid themselves here. Like I said before, the colors are really VIBRANT and the action set pieces are off the chain. Each one of the Spider-Men are so unique in their own way, and that\u00e2(TM)s what I think was meant to be. I love every single one of them. When it comes to character development alone, this is what I was looking in the past FANTASTIC FOUR films. Not to mention, the movie is very fast paced. It almost runs at 2 hours, but it felt like 15 minutes. Also, the soundtrack, including the score, is AMAZING. Since it\u00e2(TM)s in NEW YORK, we get a lot great mixtures hip-hop & funk. My head nodding throughout the entire film. The humor is PERFECT. Not a lot of films have humor that land every time, but this movie has that type of humor. It was SO FUNNY. I laughed so hard during certain scenes. Lastly, the film pays very satisfying tribute to the one and only STAN LEE. His cameo that just struck me. May he Rest In Peace. \"Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse\" is a progressive, bold, visionary, revisionist, emotionally inspiring, HILARIOUS, stunning, ACCURATE, and precise film that not only shows that they\u00e2(TM)re still can be fun comic book films, but it also shows us that anything is possible. This is ABSOLUTELY the perfect Spider-Man film & the best since Spider-Man 2.\n\nGrade: A+",

It is the most beautifully animated film I have ever seen. Spider-Verse is so fresh and funny, and feels nothing like any comic book movie has ever done before. It really is something original and entirely new.\n\nSpider-Verse is the closest that anyone will get to nailing the feeling of reading a comic book. Never before has the sensation of reading a comic book be so accurately portrayed in cinema. The film is filled to the brim with style. It oozes it. In terms of depth, scope, stakes and action it feels much like a high budget live action film. Even if you have seen all of the trailers, this film still has so many surprises. The trailers did not give away anything... you guys are in for a treat.\n\nThe film is ultimately a Miles Morales story, and it executes it perfectly. All of the many characters are handled and balanced to perfection, and they successfully built a whole universe within one movie while still focusing on Miles.\n\nThe references that the film makes to the other Spider-Man movies and the comics are some of the best I\u00e2(TM)ve seen in a movie. There is a Spider-Man 3 reference at the beginning of the film that almost had me in tears, I was laughing that hard. The Stan Lee cameo is perfect and probably the best, it rivals the Spider-Man 3 cameo, \u00e2~Nuff said\u00e2(TM). And whoever came up with that end credits scene\u00e2\u00a6 they need a raise.\n\nEveryone please go and see Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse, even if you aren't the biggest comic/superhero fan. There is something here for everyone. If you are a comic fan, then this is a no-brainer, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. Please go and support it.",

Unfortunately the animation style is incredibly poor; having a rotoscope type feel that often seems out of focus with a mesh filter (likely meant to resemble a newspaper comic-strip).  Also, the multiple Spider characters kind of diminish the value and importance of Spider-Man.  Still, it's interesting to see alternate universe versions of Spider-Man, and the action is pretty exciting.

Among the good guys, only white guys can have personality flaws. So Gwen was perfect, Miles was perfect, May was perfect, but Peter B. Parker had a lot of hangups which made him the best character in the movie. \n\n\nI have to wonder if this movie would have been better if it had no multiverse crap that is not a big deal after it's overuse in the Arrowverse. And if the movie was more about Miles and the Prowler. That was the most interesting plot in the movie but it was barely there. \nThe bit with the Prowler was very good. But it was abruptly ended in a very stupid way. \n\nHollywood really needs to stop with the PC, sanitized female and minority characters. It gives all the best roles to the white guys who can play characters with a wider range.",

I could have done without the robot and pig, though, I kind of wish it just focused on the three--but I get that this was probably a film \"for the fans\" and maybe people more acquainted with spiderman lore really loved those side characters?\n\nNow I do have to admit I wasn't as sucked into this as a lot of audience members clearly were. I thought the plot was a fairly typical superhero origin story and without any twists or turns you're largely just waiting for things to come to the conclusion you expect. But even if the film kind of ran out of steam for me near the end the beginning parts were SOLID. I liked the establishment of Black spiderman's character, I liked seeing his interactions with his family and school and stuff--even up to the point where he's stealing the Goober with red spidey is darn solid, the banter and antics in those scenes were great!\n\n...Actually, the more I think about it the film really only started to slow down and get bloated once the pig and robot were added. That may just be coincidence of them arriving during \"plot wrapup time,\" but I supposed it reiterates my point that I found them distracting from the character arcs that had been set up thus far. It really took time away from arcs that I had been invested in.\n\nBut even if the stereotypical plot and bloated number of characters was a bit of a letdown I can't let the score lower TOO much for the ingenuity of the visuals alone.

This movie has something for everyone, its probably the most interesting and beautiful animation style Ive ever seen, every scene pops and rings out with beauty. It has amazing writing and characterization, and not a single joke falls flat. Ive seen it three times in the theaters and I cant recall ever enjoying a movie so much I saw it In theaters more than twice. It really is a movie for everyone, beautiful visuals, amazing writing, an inspirational story, great soundtrack, hilarious jokes, a few sad moments that will stick with you afterwards. You can feel the love for this character in every frame and every line of dialogue. The fact that Sony made this movie shocks me because most other spidey themed movies made by them fell flat, it honestly makes me confused how they can go from the painfully dull venom movie to making this flawless animated spiderman movie. I really hope they do something else with these characters and the universe they established in this movie, itd be 100% more interesting than a few spiderman solo movies based around the venom movie.

One of the best looking films I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, please go see it. I guarantee this movie will make you happy. It is angering to see how little money this movie has made. Spider-Ham, Peni Parker, and Spider-Man Noir are only in the movies to make people laugh, so they're not very good characters. Miles and Peter B. Parker are the heart of the movie. The story is great, much better then most superhero films. The film sends a great message that anyone can be Spider-Man, Spider-Man is symbol that represents us. All you need is to be likable, heroic, and relatable. The villain is good enough, the Prowler is great though. Sometimes songs from the soundtrack will ruin emotional moments, that's definitely the biggest flaw with the movie. The writing is very good, the voice acting is very well done from every character. You get the point, go see it.",

You can tell that every shot in the movie was very well thought out because of the impact it causes in your eyes.\n\nThis new art style is amazing and original. The onomatopoeia is used in a very subtle but notorious way so that you get the feeling as if you were actually reading a comic book. I\u00c2\u00b4m really impressed that they even used the black contour that you see in the original art style, because I was wondering how could they keep that contour in 3D modeling pieces without it looking like a cartoon.\n\nThe character development was awesome. Each character managed to keep their own essence and personality. I loved how they kept Penny\u00c2\u00b4s anime style and Spider Ham\u00c2\u00b4s cartoon style. The plot is so relatable to a lot of teenagers and the moral of the story is beautiful. I loved everything about it. Watch it. Now.",

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse lives up to its hype and satisfies the needs and wants of any movie goer. The style of the movie engaged the audience with its comic-style animation. This is almost reminiscent of the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, with its visual onomatopoeia. Not only was the style great, but the comical tactics employed were genius. The audience stayed captivated in the movie's serious parts but still managed to get an incredible laugh from the audience when a character said something funny, or whenever there was an (intentionally) awkward moment. Overall, the movie did a fantastic job keeping the audience motivated with its unique styling and comedic tactics. I recommend everyone see this movie, if they haven't already.",

The movie starts with a typical background and orgin plot, and eventually leads into the superhero aspect of the film when life of the Miles is changed and paralled to that of the late spideman. What really makes this film intereting is when other characters, and their humors, come into play when the new spidermen come in from different dimensions. Although the antagonists are lacking a little depth, and the ending was a tad too touchy, the plot wad developed well, overall. I think for me personally, and the rest of the marvel community, the Stan Lee store clerk was a great touch to the movie; however, I wish he played a more integrated role in the movie with some character development. The biggest thing that I think fans are most excited for is the idea of a marvel multiverse now in play, and the implications it could have for the future of the Avengers series:  But that is a story for another day.",

Unlike other superhero movies, this movie does what has not been done: immerse you in the graphic style of graphic novels and comic books (\u201cSin City\u201d being an exception, groundbreaking in its time, but paling in comparison to the broad palette of visual art in Spider-Man). Some scenes even the color shift which is seen in comic books when the red, blue, and green don\u2019t quite align properly at the printer. On top of all this, the script is fantastic - truly funny and intelligent. The animation of the characters is superlative in the re-creation of subtle facial expressions during dialogue, something live actors themselves struggle with (and sometimes fail at). The story itself is your typical save the world story, and the script self-referentially pokes fun at itself (the oft-repeated phrase \u201c...you know the story\u201d). On top of all of this is a top-notch soundtrack. The after-movie credits show what an unbelievable assembly of graphic video artists was required to put it all together. I cannot sing enough praise about this movie. It will live permanently in my collection, to be watched many, many times. One of my favorite movies of all time.",

The references to memes? The references to old age spidermans? I would lose my ABSOLUTE MIND. (The ending trailer had me in tears of laughter) it had an amazing and genuine balance of humor and serious, neither felt forced and my friends,,,,ny friends,,,,, disney needs to TAKE. SOME. NOTES. from this movie. Disney's movies havent gotten even close to amazing in comparison to this when it comes to EVERYTHING across the board (the closest movie disney's recently done that comes close is Black Panther and i theorize they did that because Black Panther's excellence shows that disney is capable of more,but they just dont and thats why i dont respect them.) \nSONY KEEP THESE RIGHTS PLEASE.

I highly recommend going to see this movie not only multiple times but also with a group of people as it is a fun time at the movie that no one can miss.",

It's a fresh take on Spider Man with new ideas and characters.  It's a salute to the original Spider Man movies, perhaps even a true sequel in some ways to the Sam Raimi series.   It's a salute to the cartoons you fell in love with as a kid.  It involves everything that is wonderful about Spider Man and more.   I love Peter Parker, and was not thrilled about a Miles Morales.   But the Miles character, his family, and world were more than a welcome addition to the \"Spider-Verse.\"  I was thrilled and surprised to find out it's just as much of a Peter Parker story as well.  Even the plot itself was so clever and full of surprises.  A must see if you love Spider Man, comics, or just solid action and entertainment.   Another nice thing is that it's family friendly and fun - where so many Super heroes are now trending dark and more adult.   In other words, your kids can fall in love with this world for the first time as you fall in love with it all over again.   If it's true this was done by the guys that got fired from the Solo story , then that is a real shame.  This had all of the fun and magic that the Solo story sorely needed.   Kathleen Kennedy and the Lucasfilm world made a huge mistake by not letting them add their talents in the Star Wars universe.   Because what they did in the \"Spider Verse\" was a blast!",

Saw this long after the buzz died down about it, and while I can't say the hype was warranted it certainly was a great movie. Things the movie did very well, aside from the great visuals, was making the story fresh all the while juxtaposing it with various renditions. I'll say certain elements, particularly the family (Morales' father and uncle), while serviceable weren't nearly as strong as others. The villain, Kingpin, had a rather weak element as well. There are tropes the movie falls into momentarily, such as the curmugdeonly Peter B. Parker playing the tsundere reluctant-but-then-sweet teacher and the scene where all the spider-whatevers show up and start unnecessarily testing Morales by beating him up before quickly assessing he's not ready (what a bunch of a-holes). These things aren't bad per se, they're just less good than everything else the movie offers. A slightly (SPOILERY) nitpicky thing I have is when Kingpin does his signature double-fisted slam thing onto Morales and he doesn't die despite the same thing killing the original Peter Parker. Then, Morales (presumably) regains consciousness and staggers to his feet, taking several moments in which Kingpin (who is just watching dumbly) could go ahead and hit him again or whatever but doesn't. That scene was just weird to me. Anyways, the last thing that was also great was the soundtrack. It fit so well with the film's style.",

The characters, while already fan favourites are given a completely new lease on life in this film. They stay more true to the relatable essence of the comics while giving us nods and odes to the previous Spider-Man films and shows. Going into the film I was worried about how they would work all the characters into one cohesive story but they managed to do it. The story feels smooth and while it is yet another Spider-Man origin story, it still feels refreshing and new. Given all these positives you would be lead to believe this is a 5 star film, well for me its a four and a half stars. I only have two problems with it, one being while I love the original score and the original soundtrack, at some points the latter just doesn\u00e2(TM)t work. Without giving anything away there is a scene at the start where they somehow fit three/four different songs from the original soundtrack in under three minutes. It just doesn\u00e2(TM)t work and makes the moment a tad overwhelming but the original soundtrack does work in other moments. great example of it working is the \u00e2whats up danger\u00e2? scene, the scene mixing and blends everything together and the lyrics and tone match the subject amazingly and caused me to have goosebumps for awhile after. The second fault i have is, no epilepsy warning. The film features a lot of flashing lights and colours which could be dangerous for some.",

It is chaotic and confusing, with very a very basic story-line for the most part. The music and songs are distracting and annoying, and while the visuals are inventive and different, they are also jarring. The film has a dark feel to it overall, and apart from a couple of scenes towards the end which show true comedy and depth, it was mainly un-involving and uninteresting. \nAAWA GGWA",

The animation is fantastic, but the first five minutes of flashing colors made my head ache. Then, there is the small issue of no character development in the final three Spider-mans: Peni Parker, Peter Poker, And noir Spider-man.  They seemed to be just added for different animation styles, which wouldn't be a problem, if they had more character fleshed out.

When the action starts picking up it turns into everyone tossing him around until they can deal with the problem. When he finally gains control of his power it feels like he earned. \nThe whole cast does really well. I love John Mulaney and I'm kind of surprised he did so well in a kids movie considering majority of his humor is mature.

The movie captivated my attention the entire time, and not once did I look away for fear I'd miss something. My only complaint is that Miles went from not being able to use his abilities on command to being a master of them. Progress is usually a lot slower than that in my opinion, so maybe Marvel should've spend a little more time on his progress. Other than that, the movie was amazing. There were a couple of references and parts of the movie that confused me, but that's because I haven't read the comics and therefore lack some background and context. Even without knowing the context or reading the comics, the movie was pretty straightforward and easy to follow. The soundtrack shouldn't be overlooked either since it ELEVATED the quality of the movie (get it?)",

That being said, I still enjoyed this movie from start to finish - the animation is unlike anything I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ve ever seen, the characters are lovable, it imbues it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s already lively script with witty, laugh out loud humor, the fight scenes keep you on the edge of your seat, the soundtrack is amazing. You will FEEL this movie. Well done, Sony.",

My woman and I arrived 15 minutes late to the film, and when we sat down Miles was having issues with his body producing natural adhesives, at least the puberty jokes could not get any worse than that.\nThis film, though aimed at kids, did wonders for someone like myself who still thoroughly enjoys comic books as I wait to finish this review so I can read this week\u00e2(TM)s latest issues (It\u00e2(TM)s Thursday NCBD is every Wednesday, I gotta keep up!). So granted, the digital effects were captivating. It looked like a 3D holographic comic book cover for the better part of nearly two hours of my life. I love how the hip-hop covers of \u00e2StarBoy\u00e2? and \u00e2Coloring Book\u00e2? could be seen on the Times Square ads and how the characters were not sacrificed to be walking stereotypes in lieu of their color, except maybe Miles\u00e2(TM) mom (afro-P.R. and a R.N. who speaks Spanglish, AI dios mios!) .\nSpider-ham could have been left out until he pulled the mallet. Spidey Noir was as stoic as I wanted him to be and Spider-Gwen finally gained my respect after years of trying (unsuccessfully) to read any comic with her in it (I\u00e2(TM)m more of a GwenPool guy anyway), still, Peter Parker that hung up the tights took the cake as my favorite Spider-Man in the pic.\nFor years, I ran away from Spider-Man thinking that all he does is bitch like a little kid about his problems so he must be a character ONLY for little kids to idolize. He juggles insanely hot playmates with love from his Aunt, a high IQ that gets him throughout college and into the exec chair of his own business, and if that doesn\u00e2(TM)t pay the bills he can make scratch Atna successfull newspaper company, why complain? But to see it all be tore down for this sweat pants Spider-Man, that touched me as much as hearing Uncle Ben\u00e2(TM)s quote for the umpteenth time in !y life because that brought Spidey back to an everyman level for me and gave me someone to root for in the red and blue tights which I haven\u00e2(TM)t in a long time.\nAs for Miles, he perfectly displayed what it is to suffer from an anxiety disorder, I enjoyed the feel-good story of him saving the day and gaining acceptance of himself not through his peers, but I saw him more as a walking PSA of mental illness, an after-school special in regards to puberty, and a Trayvon Martin-esque martyr if he would have lost his life in the movie. To me, Miles was more of a representation of multiple movements for equality than just a singular character. Oh, and that was cold how Gwen put him in the friend zone. And as for the outro with 60\u00e2(TM)s Spider-Man ; I smell a sequel.",

In this case, I'm glad I broke the rules.\n\n\"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" breaks plenty of rules on its own.  Along the way, it offers a variety of pleasant surprises.  There's a cameo by Stan Lee (creator of the Marvel Comics franchise) selling Spider-Man costumes and validating that we're all Spider-Man by gruffly confirming that his one-size-fits-all costumes fit everybody - at some point.  There's Mahershala Ali (Uncle Aaron) not lighting up the screen with his presence, primarily because he's not on the screen.  There's Liev Schreiber (Kingpin) showing his dramatic range by shifting from his dour, but excellent, role in \"Ray Donovan\" to Spider-Man's dour nemesis.  In a total shocker, there's Nicholas Cage (Spider-Man Noir) appearing in an interesting movie.  There's Hailee Steinfeld (Spider-Woman/Gwen Stacy) in another transformative role.  There's Byron Tyree Henry as, wait for it, Jefferson Davis, the father of our Afro-Puerto Rican protagonist.  It's all just weird and wildly wonderful.\n\nThe plot is also predictably bizarre.  As part of his plan for world domination, Kingpin has built an atomic collider that inadvertently creates a rip in the space/time continuum.  Our protagonist Miles Morales (Shameik Moore - 2015's \"Dope\"), a 16-year-old student at Brooklyn Visions Academy, is bitten by a mechanical spider.  Soon enough, he explores his developing super powers and is out to thwart Kingpin.  Because of the disruption in the space/time continuum, other Spider characters are able to come to his aid:  the aforementioned Spider-Woman, Spider-Man (Chris Pine), Older Spider-Man/Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), Spider-Noir (Cage as a black-and-white character in a trench coat), and, my personal favorite, Spider-Ham/Peter Porker (John Mulaney) who bears a striking resemblance to Elmer Fudd.  Back to the plot: on the brink of world disaster, they collectively save the day.\n\nEven visually, this film is disorienting.  There is conventional CGI, Ben-Day dots (used regularly in vintage comic books), an anime character (Peni Parker, voiced by Kimiko Glenn), thought balloons, even written sound effects reminiscent of the old \"Batman\" TV series (1966-1968).  Directors Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman and Robert Persichetti, Jr. have pulled out all the stops.  It's all so bizarrely unique that Sony is reportedly trying to patent the processes used to craft these unique visual mash-ups.\n\nIf you are looking for a logical/linear story line or deep insight into the human condition, get serious.  You really expected that from comic book characters?!   But if you want a strange but wondrous adventure, in the immortal words of Steppenwolf (1968), \"You don't know what/We can find/Why don't you come with me little (gender neutral pronoun)/On a magic carpet ride?\"",

            "content": "A colorful and breezy picture (and I do mean picture, it is gorgeous to look at), Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the knockout that many fans wanted for decades and one of the best animated superhero films ever made. I'd argue it's the best representation of Spider-Man in cinema and the closest one to the manic glee and near-cosmic weirdness of the venerable series it is based on. Spider-Verse uses new fan-favorite Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as its protagonist and we spend a great deal of time with him. Now while it would be redundant to talk about # representationmatters at this point, it was refreshing to get a Spider-Man who was NOT Peter Parker. Parker (Jake Johnson, Chris Pine) ends up being a secondary character(s) and functions as a mentor to the younger, anxious Morales, which was an interesting dynamic. We also get crazy alternate universes colliding, with several different Spider-People on screen and interacting at once. (Fear not. It does not turn into Crisis on Infinite Earths madness.)\n\nLet's talk about the visuals. HOLY GOD. This movie is beautiful. I'm glad they didn't bother with the typical CGI that abounds in multiplexes these days. And yes, while hand drawn animation is still my favorite, that artform has undergone a slow death outside of Japan this past decade. (Take a look at DC animation now and compare it to 15-20 years ago.) Spider-Verse opts for a cell-shaded look which looks remarkably close to comic panels of today. It allows the filmmakers a lot of freedom with visuals and crafting whatever they need without looking out of place or cheesy. Voice performances were exceptional (Morales, alternate universe Parker, and Spider-Gwen stand out). While we get plenty of laughs, there are plenty of heartbreaking moments to be had, sans the melodrama. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse packs all the entertainment one wants and then some. It will probably become what Mask of the Phantasm is to Batman. I look forward to the sequel and hopefully we can get some other off-beat characters such as Ben Reilly's Scarlet Spider.

The superheroes have to get to the bottom of what put them together and figure out how to right those wrongs for the sake of the universe.\n\nActing: 10\n\nBeginning: 8\n\nCharacters: 10\nEasily one of the shining moments of this movie is learning about each spider character. Their differing personalities make the team-ups and dialogue scenes hilarious. Peter B. Parker shows us what kind of man a hero becomes when his life completely falls apart. He's nonchalant and sloppy, but not because he doesn't care anymore. Meanwhile, Spider-Ham was just perfect in every single way. I won't spoil any of his moments like trailers have already done, but his featured scenes don't disappoint in the least.\n\nVillains are solid as well. Kingpin is a coldhearted badass who intimidates everyone in his path. As the story progresses, you understand what helped to make him who he becomes. This movie did an excellent job of fleshing out each character and giving them purpose.\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 8\n\nConflict: 10\n\nGenre: 8\nAnimated film or not, this movie is as good as it gets. Though not in my upper echelon of superhero films, it still ranks right up there with some of the best. Incredibles 2 gets the nod for best animated superhero film this year, but Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not too far behind. \n\nMemorability: 9\nThe animation style alone is enough to make this movie one that sticks around in your head long after you've watched it. The action sequences are long and satisfying, really popping off the screen. A positive message puts a nice little bow on top of everything.\n\nPace: 10\nEntertaining from beginning to end, Into the Spider-Verse sets a swift pace and doesn't slow down. Even scenes between the action have something important or funny happening that keeps the audience involved in the story. No slow-downs or lulls, the movie remains fresh deep into its runtime.\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 5\nEnding was meh. Wasn't bad, but it didn't give me that Cherry On Top feel that I typically look for in an ending. It left me feeling a little...empty.\n\nOverall: 88\nWhen I first put Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse on my radar, I had no idea what to expect. I saw it as more of Sony trying to cash in on their one main Marvel character. After seeing it, I'm happy to report that I was dead wrong. I really enjoyed the movie and I can't wait to check it out again at home in 4K!",

There are moments you forget it's even animated and moments you couldn't believe it is anything other. \nDespite it being more 'animated' than any cg movie I have seen, It is also a rich story where the dialogue isn't clunky and maintains a balance of sincerity and meta jokes. \nHere at last is an animated movie from a major studio directed squarely at adults. This is not a movie for young children and is paced to serve the older audiences of super hero films. This is backed up by the loud five year old behind me * mommy I want to leave I dont want this movie!!!*. For an older overstimulated generation to lose themselves in this visually hectic and wonderful feast is great, but I hope the marketing as a PG movie will make parents of younger children think twice.",

            "content": "(Minor-Plot Spoilers)\n\nI knew \"Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse\" was going to be great, but I didn't realize it was going to be amazing.\n\nWe first have to talk about the animation.  Similar to many Telltale Games products, the animation is inspired by comic books.  The colors are loud, bright, and poppy.  Warning to people with epilepsy, this movie has many flashing colors at times, so be cautious when watching the movie.  This movie embraces its comic book visuals by making all the animation embraces the style.  The action is like one from a comic, the camera angles pop, and the character designs are all unique and distinct.\n\nOur main protagonist is Miles Morales.   This is a film about Miles Morales becoming his own superhero.  While the other Spider People he meets knows he has great potential to be a superhero, the issue lies that he needs to be ready now to help get the other Spider People back to their dimensions.  He just got his powers, and now he must replace the prior Spider-Man and become the new Spider-Man.\n\nEvery character has an excellent personality, motivations, flaws, and emotions.  This movie made me tear a few times for how much I identified with multiple characters and their struggles.  Rio Morales, Miles' father, is filled with so much heart and conflict.  He is a great dad, but he and his son are growing apart.  Rio is loving and strict but is still understanding.  Miles wants more freedom but needs more guidance.  Adding in Mile's Uncle, Aaron, and you have a tug-of-war of family conflict.  As the plot continues, the emotional weight of the stakes becomes more teary-eyed, you really get the feels a lot in this movie.  \n\nBut family themes also lies in the relationship between Miles and, who I'm going to call, Spider-Man 30 (the Spider-Man I assume to be in his 30s).  Spider-Man 30 and Miles have not just a teacher-student relationship but also a father-son relationship; which makes a perfect scene for Spider-Man 30's character arc.  With each scene, Spider-Man 30 grows, and as a result, he is more interesting.  Because of the course of events that happen in the movie he has to evolve continually throughout the film, and it is paced organically.  He turns from a Spider-Man that is in a depressive state into a Spider-Man that is ready to move on to the next stage of his life.   The three primarily focused Spider-People are Spider-Man 30, Miles Morales, and Gwen Stacy (aka Spider-Gwen).  Spider-Gwen doesn't have a character arc, her role consists of being a foil and support for Miles and the rest of the team (just as an analysis; it does not make her character any less enjoyable).\n\nThe other Spider-People are secondary characters who have traits and identities of their own.  Spider-Ham has his own 2Dish animation mix with the 3D animation.  Peni Parker is an anime character with a robot \u00e2\" they always remind me of the movie \"Next Gen\" on Netflix (which is a compliment, I love that movie, go watch it).  Spider-Man Noir is voiced by Nicholas Cage, enough said, that is stupid-genius casting.  When these characters start getting their own movies, I will gladly throw my money at them.\n\nOne final note I will discuss is that seeing this movie in RealD-3D is worth the extra money.  You get an additional amount of depth with every frame, and the 3D perspective enhances the visual experiences.\n\n4.8/5 Stars",

Not only from a story perspective but it's also visually stunning. The animation is beyond glorious.\n\nThere is absolutely so much to praise about this movie. Starting with the characters. To be honest, I didn't know that much about Miles Morales. If anything, I only knew that Miles Morales existed. But this movie showed me how great of a character is Miles. Not only he's a great badass character in those great action sequences, but much like Peter Parker is in the comics and in the movies, Miles Morales is a very relatable character. He's going through a very tough part in his life. He has trouble connecting to his father. He doesn't like the school he's attending. His given smart parts where the viewer can totally identify himself with Miles.\n\nPeter Parker was great in this movie. He definitely shares some screen time alongside with Miles but he's not used in a way where Peter is far more important than Miles. This is definitely the story of Miles and the movie acknowledges that.\n\nNicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir was excellent. Loved his character and every moment he had on screen. Even Spider-Ham or Peter Porker was very funny, which leads me to say that this movie is hilarious. The movie had a very unique and funny way of presenting these characters rather than just filling us with the basic info of each of them.\n\nThe animation is my favorite aspect. It feels like the entire movie you're reading a comic book movie. Sometimes squares appear saying what the character is thinking. Or even those big \"BOOM\" after a character punches someone appears. You even get to see one of those stamps that every comic book has.\n\nIt really is gorgeous animation. Something that it's a first time for me saying regarding Sony Animation because I don't usually enjoy their movies, and their animation is usually normal. Nothing special about it. This time they went big and it worked for them. Words can't express really how much I loved the animation. It was outstanding. It really was.\n\nThe story was also very engaging and interesting. A unique look in the many Spider-Man movies we've seen. And it worked.\n\nMy only issue with the film were the villains. Wilson Fisk looked great, he was a badass, and I understood what he was doing yet I never really got the why he was doing it. Then we have several villains that appear throughout the movie. Sure, they looked great, but they were simply villains, which I guess worked out for the movie.\n\nFinal Thoughts.\nThat been said, this film was great. I had a great time. I enjoyed. Hands down, best animated movie of the year, and quite frankly, possibly best Spider-Man movie since Raimi's take. There're also some hilarious references to the previous Spider-Man movies and an awesome end credits scene.",

It's the real deal kind of cinema. And, now, as a dad. Oh jeez. I saw it with my 6-year-old daughter, and... Whew. Was not expecting the emotional impact.

The best of everything media has to offer with the reflection of our inner journeys (\"the Hero's Journey\" pretty much all movies are based on) in current culture.\nIt took the best of everything available now and there was nothing \"unnecessary\" in it in my opinion. Most movies have scenes that ruin the momentum, or aspects. Kind of like if a movie was a puzzle and they added pieces of other puzzles that didn't fit and take you out of the film.\nThe emotions, story and animation were all perfectly done. The scary moments were scary, the sad moments tugged on my heart and the funny moments made me laugh selflessly. The navigation of emotions are perfectly balanced. Which is brilliant considering how short the scenes are and how fast paced the movie is. The pacing is perfect, giving just enough time to enjoy pieces of the story with absolutely no fluff.\nIt has a full identity. The animation is absolutely unique among all other animation films to me. Staying true to the comic book origins while also bringing life through gorgeous animation.\nI really feel like the culture this movie was based on was also well represented and authentic. The soundtrack is amazing. Bringing the best of big theatric sound and raw hiphop/rap artists. Some movies that are based on African American culture it feels like a white guy tried his best to give his view on it...and it's cringy. Although I am white so I don't even have a great opinion on this hah.\nGreat casting.The characters and voice acting communicate the story seamlessly and hold the balance of the film's messages. Which almost never happens in movies in my opinion. Shows like True Detective, Avatar, The Wire and others where the world is so full that it's so easy to become immersed I think have a similar quality (immersion) that the creators of this movie also created.\nIt really felt like the detail of each scene was as \"full\" as a full half of other animation movies of today.\nI believe this to be the greatest animated achievement of it's time congratulations to all who worked on this film I hope you are proud of your work :) Thank you.",

It is a really enjoyable movie going experience.\n\nLooking at the plot from the outside, it may seem confusing. For example, how can they have more than one Spider-Man etc?

Crafted with genuine and absolute passion by its creators, it honors not only the talent and heart of its titular character himself, but (unlike any superhero film before) also celebrates the wider lore and mythology of the comics themselves.\n\nSpider-Verse is the rare superhero film that truly and authentically explores the heart and soul of who Spider-Man. By expanding the titular superhero character to a diverse new roster, it posits the rare moral message that perhaps, Spider-Man can be anyone.\n\nWhile not an absolutely perfect film (the pacing can be a little bit rushed and some side characters are unavoidably somewhat sidelined), the amount this movie does right is incredulously monumental. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a landmark film, a milestone in the superhero genre, and rightfully stands as one of the greatest superhero films ever made.",

The film stars Shameik Moore as Miles Morales, Jake Johnson as Spider-Man and Hailee Steinfeld as Spider-Woman.\n\nThe story I found to be very gripping and unique, from the various plot lines to the very well flowing narrative. \n\nThe voice acting was also very strong, especially Shameik Moore as Miles Morales, I found that he gave a really fitting and stylised performance.\n \nThe characters for the most part were well written and very entertaining, but I did find some characters like Spider-Ham and Peni Parker to be very underwhelming and just there to get a cheap laugh.\n\nThe animation was also really vibrant and stylistic, from the extremely quick character movements to the beautiful and unique comic book style.\n\nThe action in the film was detailed, entertaining, intense and very fast paced, especially the two final action sequences.\n\nThe soundtrack in my opinion was steady, but at times it did feel a little overbearing and a bit obnoxious. \n\nThe comedy was good and witty, but now and again there'd be a joke that did fall a little flat.\n\nThe film did also have some very strong atmosphere, especially in a twist reveal at the end of the second act.\n\nThe film was also very intriguing and enjoyable, and I hope to watch it again soon.\n\nOver all I give it a\n8/10 - would recommend",

If there was anyone who would like this film no matter what it would of been me , at yet i didn't like it that much. I really makes me sad to do this . This film showed promise from the first teaser . As I'm doing art for my gcse's the art style blew me away . I even tried to replicate it but it in an art project but it didn't work. Then I found out miller and lord who directed the lego movie were directing it which got me more intrigued . I liked lego movie as a kid , I knew they would bring a certain humor to the film . Then sunflower came out which I even liked even though I don't really like music of that style. And then I found out nic cage was spider noir which was pretty cool (I'm not a fan of nic cage he's just the only cast member I recognized). Then the reviews came out . 100% by critics. If it got 100% it must be good . Everything seemed to be going for it . The visuals the comedy the music the good reviews . So I decided to go watch the film . There was actually a lot of people I knew from school mainly from 6 form in the theatre with me when I watched it . Usually when I watch a film it takes time for to have a final opinion on a film . There are lots of films I like initially but then I realize aren't that good , but in this case I was a bit underwhelmed already when the credits began to roll . To put this film simply I would say the only standout good thing about this film are things I thought would be good but thats it . The visuals and comedy we're both really good but everything else didn't impress me to much. The story was meh the acting was meh the villain was actually kinda bad. not the worst by any means but kinda bland , which I wasn't expecting. The only thing to kingpin is his bare bone motivation and thats basically it . He could of not of been there and there would be bearly any difference to the film . (spoilers) it's true he kills Chris pine spider man but he's only on screen for like a minute so his death personally didn't hit much (spoilers over)  also that brings up another point the emotional moments were weak for me  as they usually have little reason for you to be sad about them . (Spoilers again ) when the uncle dies it isn't sad as he literal is there for two consecutive scenes just to be forgotten and then brought back just to be killed of . When the others are like to miles \" your not good enough \" or something ( I really can't remember what happened in that scene i found it forgettable) to miles it didn't hit me because first thecharacters didn't  convince me in what they are saying (It isn't the acting is bad it's the dialogue ) second it comes seemingly  out of nowhere and I don't remember miles being that noticeable sad afterwards  . My main problem though was the spider people. To put it briefly they were just about fleshed out enough to have low key dimensions (no pun intended) which is nice but could of been better if there was more time , and that goes for spider Gwen as well . She just had a more formal introduction compared to the others, which I wasn't expecting as she was built up as a big character. Also spideham , I was expecting a average character but he just got on my nerves ; he was like The jar jar of this movie . The interaction between miles and peter is nice though but the problem is there's not enough of it. Now just to clarify these are nit picks of the film . They don't bring the film down for me . The point of me bring this up is to show that I believe this film is good but by no means amazing (again no pun intended). Again just to mention good visuals and comedy . The reason why I wrote this review is because I've been seeing a lot of reviews hailing it as one of the best animations of the year , which is far from the truth atleast for me . I think I'm probably just missing something everyone else is seeing in this film . Also I want a sequel which shows I don't dislike it . I'm probably just over analyzing .",

I do wish some things had been done differently but for what we got it's an amazing roller coaster ride! I mean Miles was a very interesting character and the other Spider people were great too! Spider Ham was a joy to watch and so was the Spider man Noir guy...also got to admit the idea of him getting rich introducing the Rubix cube was funny! Spider Gwen great, loved her and hope if this film gets a sequel that'll we'll get to see more of her. \n\nI do have a complaint though and it's probably just me being a little picky. I wasn't stuck on Kingpin as the villain, I mean don't get me wrong he was still good but I kinda felt he wasn't suited to be the main villain. I kinda remember the 90s Spiderman cartoon a bit too much and was expecting him to be like tricked into it but no. Still even with that, he was a great villain! \n\nThe animation for me is a little hard to get used to and it's not quite to my taste but heck, once Spider Ham, Spider Man noir and Spider anime(By the way wasn't a big fan of her) I can understand why it was chosen since the contrast of art styles is good. \n\nI don't think I'll rewatch this film since I don't think there is any rewatch value in it but some films in my book aren't rewatchable and once is enough...and that's what this film is. And so I'll say to conclude defiantly glad I saw it.",

            "content": "The hype is real.  So you think you know Spider-Man.  If you watch movies, he's Peter Parker with the same old backstory, but some of the minor details get changed along the way, depending on what version you're watching.  But what if there were multiple dimensions where the entity that is Spider-Man is different in every one of them?  This is about Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) getting bit by a spider, assuming the powers and the role, all the while navigating an interdimensional drift that converges on this one character.  Sounds complicated, right?  Well, this is all put together by people who clearly know what they are doing, because it all makes perfect sense when you watch it.  I have heard nothing but the highest of high praise for this, so I got damn excited for it.  This kind of floored me, because as a superhero movie, it is next to flawless.  Now even with all the positive reviews, the best omen I got from this was when I learned that Phil Lord has a writing credit on this.  From 21 and 22 Jump Street to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, I was already well aware that he is capable of densely packing as much entertainment into a feature as possible without sacrificing flow and character development.  One of the biggest reasons why this is so fresh is that they are not telling the same story again.  You can't go five years without the character being rebooted or reimagined, and at this point, the origin story has been done to death.  They sidestep that not only with something creative and recurring, but they manage to bring new origin stories that haven't been given this big of a platform before.  I am hesitant to say too much, because there are just that many great surprises to it, and it is a pleasure to see where they take this story that doesn't have to abide by rules of canon or sometimes even physics.  Into the Spider-Verse is laugh out loud funny, but you also feel the stakes when the action peaks as well.  The artwork and animation is gorgeous, and they manage to shape and mold different styles that all come together into one package.  It's aesthetically pleasing and the story is extremely well thought out.  A telltale sign on how much I am enjoying a movie is how few notes I take while watching, and I took about half the amount that I normally do; I was scared I would miss something, and I really was that into the movie.  I don't even have any real complaints about this, and as soon as it was over, I wanted to go and watch it again (update: I have seen it twice now and it is still great).  This is one of the best movies of the year.",

At this point in time, I have had 5 viewings of \"Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse\" 5(going on 6) and I'm left in awe each and every time I sit in my recliner.\n\nThe plot in this film is so fresh and exceptionally well done: using a new Spider-Man learning how to be a hero from an older Spider-Man who has forgotten how to be one? They nailed it. Filled with so much heart and human emotion, \"Into The Spider-Verse\" is a film that does so many different things and succeeds in every single one both thematically and in it's ambitious narrative.\n\nThe script is also handled spectacularly while being extremely well written. Dialogue is real and believable; never in this film did I feel like \"oh real people don't talk like this.\" Everything is natural and flows, even all the superhero jargon sounds less expository as in other films. Exceptionally well done and paced.\n\n\"Into The Spider-Verse\" is a MARVEL in modern animation,from cell shading, to 3D models retouched with 2D animated features, blending the two styles seamlessly and also paying homage to traditional animation by animating characters 2 frames at a time, but kicking it into 1 frame to smooth out the more dynamic movements just to hyper-emphasize the fluidity of the characters. Utilizing chromatic aberration to \"faux pull focus\" while refrencing golden and silver age comic book printing errors. The film is a joy to look at. Each frame is handled with heart and it shows on screen.  Visually spectacular. \n\nSpider-Man has always been a character made from strife. The theme of life taking more than it gives has always been Peter Parker's shtick, and never has it been clear here. The theme in this movie is failure, and more importantly, getting up afterwards. In life, things will knock you down, but you always get up. We are all filled with so much untapped potential, and at the end of the day, there isn't the Green Goblin or Kingpin standing in the way of us, but ourselves. Thats been the theme of Spider-Man since his conception, so to have a film so expertly and lovingly give this to us in the form of \"Into The Spider-Verse\" is something that I could not give more praise to. Best Spider-Man film. One of the best in the genre. Best movie of 2018 for me. Take care yall. Much love as usual. May add to or edit this in the future.",

Not only is the abundance of spider superheroes a thrill to watch for Spider-Man fans, but the soundtrack, visuals, and story arc are all high quality.\nThe first thought that came to mind when I saw the movie trailer was \"Wow this is going to be a great movie.\" I was genuinely excited, and the movie did not disappoint. The visuals immediately grabbed my attention. Due to the animation of the movie Marvel was able to create stunning effects. In addition the use of vibrant colors left me feeling happy as I left the movie theatre. Whether it was Miles and Peter swinging in the forest or Miles scaling buildings the smoothness of movement was amazing. The animation is some of best I have ever seen.\nNext is the soundtrack. The music definitely appeals to a certain audience, a younger audience. This being due to many rappers and pop artists being featured. While older audiences may enjoy these music forms they're without a doubt more popular among younger people. I enjoyed the soundtrack immensely, and although the soundtrack is often overlooked it is vital to a movie. \nFinally there is the story arc. This movie is clearly meant to be a coming of age story. Miles must overcome his fears and step up to the plate. But thats where the similarities with other super hero movies end. Miles is a Afro-Latino kid from Brooklyn. He is not a white male like many other superheroes. Furthermore he has not faced tragedy, at least not in the beginning of the movie. This is a far cry from what the original Spider-Man faced. And finally he is not a social pariah as many superheroes are. He is in fact quite well liked. Miles is a normal kid dealing with super powers. And thats part of what makes this movie so appealing to so many people. They could place themselves in his shoes because his life is so normal. Then there is the fact that Miles is a minority. He is one of the few minority superheroes to make it to the big screen. And that might be the greatest thing about him. It allows young minority kids looking for a role model to\nhave one. All in all this might be my favorite Spider-Man movie yet.",

But boy, oh boy, did I enjoy it. The seamless manner in which they were able to introduce so much information, but have it make instant sense to the audience, was excellent. I was initially worried about the potential lack of character development of the Spidermen/women/pigs, and while there is only so much you cando with characters introduced beyond the halfway-mark onf the movie, the development of Peter B. Parker and Spiderwoman were excellent, Peter Porker and Spiderman Noir still having substantive roles in the movie. If I was to be very critical, the anime-inspired Spidergirl was a bit lost. The other characters were useful (loved the bit with the uncle), and there just seemed to be a level of plot-action-character cohesion that DC and some Marvel Franchises *Cough* Thor *Cough* haven't been able to master. Not to mention the beautiful animation. It didn't feel childish as I had originally feared: it felt like art.\nThe animation is excellent, the storyline enthralling, and movie thoroughly enjoyable.

As well as this, the only other issue i have is kind of a *spoiler*.

You will watch as the heroes and heroines flip and swing through the city, but you will also see, firsthand, their characters develop, a critical part of storytelling that is often washed over in movies these days. This movie tackles loss, identity, betrayal, family, trust, and self-worth. And yes, there is also kick-butt action. \n\nThe brilliant writing, refreshing narrative, and gripping soundtrack make it more than a mere superhero film. In terms of visuals alone the movie is worth seeing. The animation remarkably depicts a comic-like feel, with sliding panels and thought bubbles creating an immersive experience. Morales soars to heights unseen in live action films. \n\nEveryone will leave the theater pleased. Wether it's the characters, writing, animation, soundtrack, or plot, there is an aspect of this movie to appeal for all. Adults will love the action, kids will love their superheroes, teenagers will witness their coming-of-age struggles in Miles, and Spider-Man fans will, of course, watch favorite characters fight the epic King Pin. Sweet homages throughout, a cameo from Stan Lee, and a tribute to him in the end will leave all crying and laughing. Team Maguire, team Garfield, and team Holland can reunite over their love for Spider-Verse.\n\nThis movie brings the Spider-Verse to life.

            "content": "In a year full of wonderful animated films, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse stands out.\nThis movie tells a story of becoming Spider-Man from a unique angle and clarifies from the get-go that is is not a Peter Parker story; this is a Spider-man story. For the first time on the big screen, Miles Morales is featured along with other rich and fun characters.\nBlooming in colour, the visuals resemble a moving comic-book and are truly astonishing. Complemented by creative and comical directing, this film seems as if it was born in a child's imagination! \nOne of the strengths of this picture is that ignores the recipes of the previous live-action Spider-man franchises(both Sam Raimi's and Marc Webb's) of an origin story+the main plot. Marvel's Spider-man: Homecoming did likewise by ignoring the origin and diving straight into the world. Alternatively, Sony's animated take on the Web-head embraced the arrival of a new protagonist to re-tell the origin story giving itself as much time as it needs. Rather than giving us a quick \"With great power comes great responsibility\" and letting it be, we are taken into Miles' Morales journey and experience the triumphs and tragedies of becoming a hero.\nThere is not a part that doesn't belong in the movie, the only notable problem is that the villain is under-developed. The writers gave him a very clich\u00e9 motive and expect us to empathize without fleshing out. On the other hand, it is pretty clear that the film does not intend to develop the villain but rather the abundance of protagonists.\nTo conclude, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a thrilling experience no matter if you are 5 or 75. Go watch it on the big screen while you can!",

Miles Morales in my favorite story line on the big screen. But still not a movie theatre movie.\" I saw the first trailer and got super hyped because it looked awesome. I really wanted to go but thought I probably wouldn't have time. I then had the chance to see it and did. IT WAS AMAZING. It blew past my expectations redefining what a good Marvel and Spider Man movie could be. It was sad but happy, funny but serious, and the storytelling was great. It hits on all points perfectly and Miles's character development is smooth and also perfect. The twists are unexpected and ending hits on everything emotional, funny, action packed, and overall satisfying. This is by far the best movie of the year.",

            "content": "This movie is probably the greatest animated movie many of us have seen in a very long time. While it does not take place in the now cramped MCU universe, it's plot is wonderfully crafted around the idea of multiple heroes as well as the inclusion of multiple universes, the latter being an idea many movies have built a story around, but this time around, it feels wonderfully fresh with a spider-twist. The animation, of course, is the other major selling point - it looks and acts like a comic book, and appears to be the first movie of it's kind in that regard. It includes many snide references to it's original medium, and you can tell the animators had a great deal of fun making every scene. \n\nThe characters, both heroes and villains, feel fresh, unique, and often relatable. In this movie, you don't feel like sighing at yet another Spider-Man origin story - you get fun, emotionally deep, and diverse characters out of the old material. Old Spider-Man villains return, but their designs and implementation into the story are refreshed and clever. All characters are challenged some emotionally, yet the plot doesn't feel overstuffed and you begin to care about all the heroes and their collective plight. \n\nWhile it does feel like an experiment in film making, I feel that many agree this was a step in the right direction for not only reinvigorating a tired brand, but creating more great films for their own regard, not just because they're a part of a bigger universe.",

Each variation of spider person is excuted perfectly and handled with care and humour. They used a clever story telling device to give the origin story of each spider person in a way that feels fresh and unique, even though they revisit this device a couple of times, it never feels bogged down. Each character feels like they go through the journey, such as Miles's mentor Peter B. Parker learning that he made a mistake and develops this father son/mentor bond with Miles. Gwen and Mile's relationship works well as a friendship and didn't need to be seen through as a romantic aspect. \nThe animation is this film is top notch. each character having their unique animation style and colour palette works well in this stylised world.",

There was so many ascpectd that made this movie unique, great and simply enjoyable with some some amazing characters art style and hilarious laughs; anyway enough with that lets just get started with \nThe Good:\nOne thing this movie did greatly was the art style it was so fresh seeing this on the big screen with some phenomenal action sequences  which complimented the art style .when I was in the cinema there was some times when I was sat there in ore over the sheer brilliance of it.\nAnother point to make is the charecters; for me anyway the characters were phenomenally well written with all delivering big time on laughs and truest heart felt moments for example Peter B. Parker in this movie is in a completely different state as what most people are used to which I 5hought was great and we seen him go on this journey of essential recovery throughout the movie where on the other hand Spider. Ham delivered on a great comical level which I though was well timed and pleasant. However there was one character which I thought wasn't the best. \nFinally how could we not talk about the protagonist and the story. For me Miles Morales is the perfect Spider-Man seeing his development on the screen as he denies the initial call to adventure and see him become the new Spider-Man and also with the story and message delivering that had never been done before that anyone can be Spider-Man which is just beautiful. \nIn conclusion I could be here all day talking about the good bu now I must move onto...\nThe Mixed:\nThere is only a few mixed really; for example the only character that I dint like was Pe I Parker not that that really effects the overall narrative just thought there was something missing when her robot gets destroyed but I have seen a few people who really liked her bu that's just my opinion. \nAlso  I thought that the reveal of the Prowler was predictable for me I could kind of see it coming from a mile away but then when he died it caught me of guard and it was very mixed for me as it gave miles but I thought that there could've been so much more potential in the future. So now movin onto...\nThe Bad:\nThere's only one thing bad about this and it was the posture of king ping. He was meant to be the main villain he just looked dodgy with how big he was it didn't come of as scary it was just disturbing which is a shame because his character was on point.\nConclusion;\nThere is so much more I could've talked about this movie like the villain and the family life for miles. But it was a simply enjoyable experience for all the family. Finally this is the first movie since Guardians of the Galaxy that has left me wanting more\nFinal Score: 9.8",

Incredibile come riescano a tirare fuori una storia su Spider-Man cos\u00ec nuova e originale, una trama di cui io e tanti altri non avevano neanche sentito parlare. Oltre alla fantastica storia basata su un fumetto che pensavo fosse sconosciuto, il film offre animazioni moderne e nuove, una tecnica di cui ancora non conosco le meccaniche che con meno immagini al secondo garantisce movimenti di camera praticamente senza controllo. Questo serve a creare scene d'azione semplicemente fantastiche, emozionanti e coinvolgenti ai massimi livelli. Il tutto, oltre ad essere diretto con uno stile giovane, con musiche moderne e coraggiose, presenta anche un impatto cromatico fuori dal comune, una vera a propria gioia per gli occhi. La storia offre anche quel giusto livello di emozione e umorismo che necessita, senza esagerare o andare fuori tema. E' un film d'animazione che osa tantissimo, che viene ricompensato dal suo coraggio: il risultato \u00e8 un grandissimo film, che supera in tutto ci\u00f2 che si \u00e8 visto quest'anno e diventa automaticamente il miglior film d'animazione dell'anno.",

This is a thousand times better than Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland ever have been in the role. I loved that there was no #thuglife or gangster worship crap to mar the tapestry. In fact, I loved the fact that the main hero's dad is a cop and a moral one. Too many films now put the cops as the bad guys and it isn't right. One of the first films in a while that didn't disturb any political melodrama while preaching very good values. To become who we truly can be takes faith and courage, and the courage to step into parenthood is worth having and putting into action. I loved all the nods and the tributes to a glorious franchise and it's creator, while being able to put a new Spider-Man in the spotlight. Heck, the color scheme might be part of why I love Miles' suit so much, it reminds me of Batman Beyond a lot. Very enjoyable film that I can't wait to own.",

Parker, Gwen Stacy, Peni Parker, Spider Ham, Spider Man Noir: The Spider people voiced by Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfield, Kimiko Glenn, John Mulaney and Nicolas Cage.\n\nPlot Summary\n\tThis story takes place in Miles\u00e2(TM) universe.  Just like all the other spider people, he gets bitten by a strange spider and gets the powers of Spiderman.\n\tAlso, the main bad guy, Kingpin, is working with inter-dimensional equipment.  The first test goes badly and several Spider-people from other dimensions gets dragged into Miles\u00e2(TM) dimension.  They will have to work together in order to stop Kingpin, and get a way home.\n\nSCORING\nMain Characters\n\tI like these spider people a lot.  They work well together and each of them has a great personality and quirks.  The best parts of the film are when they are working/not working together.  SCORE: 10\n\nSupporting Characters\n\tKingpin makes for a good villain because we\u00e2(TM)re told of why he does what he does.  And the other non superheroes add something special to the mix, namely Aunt May who has a big secret to show the Spider people.  SCORE: 9\n\nPlot\n\tI enjoyed the trip that the film took me through.  At moments, it was funny and at others it was gripping drama.  But it all works in the end.  SCORE: 9\n\nOriginality\n\tI know, I know.  I\u00e2(TM)ve heard the origin story a few too many times, and this film makes reference to it one too many times.  But the main characters really add a nice spin to what could be a stale story.  SCOR: 8\n\nViolence Factor\n\tNot for the youngest \u00e2\" some people actually die in this film \u00e2\" albeit not in a graphic way.  Still, the deaths are a vital part of the story.\n\tBut I don\u00e2(TM)t like the fact that either the characters are perfectly healthy or they\u00e2(TM)re dead.  Nobody gets injured in these films.  SCORE: 8\n\nOther Moral Issues\n\tThis film shows how a group of strangers can get together to make a great team.  It also shows the power of family and the belief one has in oneself.  SCORE: 10\n\nFinal Score (out of 60): 50\t\t% Score: 83.33%\n\tYes, it\u00e2(TM)s another Spiderman \u00e2\" or another superhero film.  But I see is as a challenge to make the other action films better.",

So not content with spinning off morally ambiguous villains, here we have a (cynical, much?) attempt to bring about yet another incarnation of the beloved character but this time in animated form. Focusing on the more ethnic and lesser adapted Miles Morales, a half African-American, half Hispanic Spider-Man from the comic books as the main character is a wise choice. With Phil Lord, who cooked up the innovative and meta-funny The Lego Movie before, on screenplay duty, he takes the things that would normally work against the film and utilizes them to the script's advantage, as he finds hilarious and clever ways to play with the idea of different Spider-Man/Gwen/Ham from different dimensions and inverts the tediousness of the 'origin story' into an actually funny postmodern joke. Rendered in a unique and exciting style using seizure-inducing colour palettes that visualizes what a 10-year-old on a sugar high would look like, this is a film that somehow manages to feel fresh and enjoyable despite its formulaic elements as the film charts Morales' search for his own Spider-Man identity amongst the many different counterparts that has broken through as a result of Kingpin's MacGuffin. The script has its funny moments, but its structure is simple enough not to confuse the kids nor tax the adults' minds and the finale sequence has the look and sophistication of a Saturday morning cartoon series, but with better graphics. So, well done, Sony, for breathing new life into a seemingly used-up franchise and find yet another cash cow within while doing it with such grace and style.",

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse introduces Brooklyn teen Miles Morales, and the limitless possibilities of the Spider-Verse, where more than one can wear the mask.\n\nMan, when I first saw the trailers for this film (by the way, how often do I say that in my reviews?), it looked fucking awesome (also, can I curse on a PG movie rating?). Also, who could've guessed that we'd be in the mood for ANOTHER Spider-Man movie? Well, we get a lot of films we don't ask for - thankfully this one was awesome. \n\nLet's start with the animation because that was absolutely gorgeous. This film is filled with spectacular, beautiful looking CGI and visuals. The colors, the design, the look, everything was so gorgeous. The animators implemented a style choice that made it look more like a retro style of animation. This is undeniably one of the most gorgeous animations of the year, with so many beautiful, memorable shots and sequences throughout. \n\nYou know what was really good about this film? - the writing. The writing, the execution, the directing, everything was on point. There was a consistent tone and style throughout, even with multiple directors. The film was fun, emotional, and relatable. The characters were all so unique and all so interesting. I didn't know anything about Miles Morales prior to this film, so it was really interesting to learn about him, along with all the other characters. \n\nWhat made this film so compelling was because of its themes and its relatability. It's a story about a young boy who's suddenly handed an immense amount of responsibility and his response to that. This film is kind of like the fun, comic book movie mixed with serious and genuine elements. It's an all around strong film with so many different things going for it. Even though we've kind of seen this story before, it's still just as effective, if not more. \n\nIn the end, \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" is one of my favorites of the year. It's fun, funny, exciting, adventurous, and a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre.",

It looked bland and dumb and just a movie for diversity in movies (which isn't bad) but that shoved it down your throat without a good story or acting. I thought that Black Panther would do the same thing, and I was mostly right (it was enjoyable at times and the acting was great, but the CGI was terrible and they did shove it down your throat). However, this film exceeded my expectations, it's easily one of the best spiderman movies ever! There were many pros; it was a great story with some emotional and heartfelt moments and great twists, like *****SPOILER***** Miles Morales uncle being The Prowler, one of the supporting villains, the original Peter Parkers death, and Doc Ock. The Doc Ock thing I didn't see coming but at the same time sorta did, because I seen in the cast list that Doc Ock was voiced by a woman, and I was hesitant to except it unless it made the story better, and it definitely did, the twist with her was awesome and I loved it because of how well done it was. The score was amazing and the new original songs like Sunflower and What's Up Danger have been stuck in my head for a long while now, in fact, as I'm writing this review I'm listening the latter song. The villains, as I said earlier, were all great - Kingpin has been on a role this year as one of the best villains to ever villain, first being awesome in Daredevil and now this. His backstory is tragic and you can understand why he's doing what he is doing without necessarily agreeing with him, similar to Thanos from Avengers: Infinity War. Prowler was actually one of the most threatening villains I've seen, as the sound effects for his menacing roar were well done, and the twist with him was great as well. Scorpion was okay, however, he didn't really do much. The heroes were great as well - Miles Morales was awesome and I love how fleshed out his backstory was and he was funny and memorable, as was Jake Johnsons Peter Parker. Spidergwen was also awesome, and has a two great introductions. Spiderman Noir and Spiderham were great as well, but very sadly underused (I was really hyped for John Mulaney to be playing Spiderham, so I was a bit disappointed). Peni Parker, however, I'm not a big fan of. She was of the only parts of the movie I didn't like. The pacing was mostly good, but the final fight scene was a bit short, however, it was one of the best chekhov's gun moments I've ever seen (*hand lands on shoulder*... \"Hey\") and it was great fight scene as well, as were the other ones throughout the movie. The animation was really well done, and was one of the things I had really been against after seeing the first teaser, but seeing the finished product it was so awesome to look at, it was like it was jumping straight out of the comics. The greatest scene has to be when Miles takes his 'leap of faith,' one of the best movie scenes ever, I got goosebumps while I was watching. There were some cons, however. Like I said, I think the ending was a little rushed, and I also didn't like Peni Parker. I think Spiderman Noir and Spiderham should have had more screen time. I also didn't really like how kingpin was animated, he was too much of a square. In the end, this was one of the greatest spiderman movies ever that offers alot more to add to the spider-man mythos. Ranks second under Spiderman: Homecoming. Solid 8/10 - A /90%.",

Here the talented pair, along with Avi Arad and Peter Ramsey, turn their hand to a beloved Marvel item who is no stranger to a reboot; Spider-Man. But, this time we're not being subjected to yet another Uncle Ben death scene; Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse tells the origin story of another Spidey, plucky teen, Miles Morales (an energetic Shameik Moore) as he grapples with the infamous Kingpin (Liev Schreiber), helped by a number of inter-dimensional \"Spider-people\"... including a washed-up, cynical Peter Parker (voiced with a nonchalant drawl by Jake Johnson). We watch as Miles grapples with finding his feet after an unfortunate interaction with a radioactive arachnid, in a hearty and humorous adventure, that feels distinctly Lord and Miller.\nInto the Spider-Verse is a noticeably different adaptation of the friendly neighbourhood superhero; from the outset, the film cheekily satirises the incessant rebooting of its character (a flashback to a certain Spider-Man 3 moment gives perhaps the biggest laugh). Plenty of fun is poked out of comic-book movie tropes too; this doesn't change the fact however that, plot-wise, Into the Spider-Verse has little to offer in terms of originality, its narrative as predictable as a Saturday morning TV cartoon. \nThe film almost makes this redundant, however, through a stylish and confident execution, that feels fresh. Lord and Rodney Rothman's script is full of wry humour, quick-witted, yet full of heart and honesty. Miles Morales is also a more fleshed out lead than we are used to from Marvel (despite a slightly easy resolution to his arc) and his band of misfits, whilst largely one-note, are fun enough to carry the film with ease. Brian Tyree Henry and Mahershala Ali are unfeigned as Miles' father and uncle respectively and Jake Johnson is simply brilliant in an incarnation of Peter Parker hitherto undreamt of. An antagonist in the form of Kingpin is more disappointing, a forced motivation leaving him uninteresting and decidedly by-the-numbers. The movie leaves us little time to think on its faults though; it takes a relentless, yet natural, pace through riveting action sequences and comedic montages, with the ease of a web swing.\nInto the Spider-Verse's greatest strength, however, is its design. The animation is unique and aesthetic, delightfully reminiscent of an old-school comic strip. The film feels like a very real homage to its source material, the comic in comic book movie always coming first. Into the Spider-Verse won't be remembered for breaking ground in plot and character, but its design alone is enough to make you want to go back for more.\nPhil Lord and Christopher Miller have assembled a fun and frenetic film which, whilst standard on paper, is executed with artistry and flair. An incarnation of the world's favourite superhero surely to be remembered.",

            "content": "The film is OK, but it's highly overrated. It has some moments but they get lost in the mess of the \"Spider-Verse\" plot. Where do I begin? The film is too loud, too busy, too flashy and there are too many \"Spider-People\" that it doesn't know what to do with. It also has too many villians, it has a whopping six of them! Did Tombstone even do anything during this movie? Female Doc Ock eats up most of the screen time and she's not that menacing, new or interesting. There should of been more of a focus on the Kingpin and the Prowler. That's where the movie shines. Less is more. Although I wasn't a big fan of the Kingpin's square-like character design.  \n\nThe animation looks cool, but after watching it you realize it is very choppy and not that fluid. The flashy animated effects and backgrounds give you a headache.  Overall, \"Into the Spider-Verse\" feels like it's just a excuse to make anyone or anything \"Spider-Man\" just so SONY can make endless \"Spider related\" movies  since they drove the classic Peter Parker story line into the ground with their recent failed live action Spider-Man films. Did we really need to see Spider-Ham in this film? Is there a Spider-Dolphin, Spider-Aunt May, Spider-Mail Box or Spider-Mary Jane movie in the works, Sony? Or can we see a movie about a spider that gets bitten by a radioactive human! There is a thing as \"overdoing it\" and this movie does it.  Spider-Man is a character, and is not a UNIVERSE!!! And when did Spider-Man have a secret \"Bat Cave\" with tons of tech and gadgets? Wasn't Peter Parker always broke in the history of the comics? That's right, it doesn't need to make sense, because it's in a \"alternate universe\" \n\n The film kills off some meaningful characters (in a gritty way) which gets me invested about new characters (like Miles and his relationship with his Father)  and it tells a good origin / coming of age story and then somebody gets hit with a cartoon anvil or wooden mallet like in a Road Runner cartoon and it completely takes you out of it.  Not a horrible film but far from being great.",

For me even I was having trouble following everything because I was trying to catch up on characters I was not familiar with. The more you know the more you can appreciate this film. If you like Lego Movie or Lego Batman then you will appreciate this film. Looks very different from any Spider-Man film or Super Hero film I have ever seen before. The animation style had me so fascinated that I missed so much of the hidden Easter eggs like logos altered in the film. I like the dedication at the end for Stan Lee & Steve Ditko I wish that we saw more from Spider Nor, Spider-Pig, and Spider-Penny because those were the characters I knew the least about. I thought it was interesting how this film starts and has the Comic Book approval logo I feel like this whole film is a visual a visual spectacle. I thought it was interesting seeing the differences from other Spider-Men film. It was interesting seeing the differences in the villains or variations on the heroes. It was interesting how One Peter was different from the other in age, hair color, what happened to the different Peter Parkers. I liked the montage and references to other Spider-Men. I like all the references and Easter eggs in this film to previous Spider-Man things as well as variations of Spider-Man. I like how they explained the differences on different Spider-Man. Like Peter having dark hair vs. Bright Blonde hair. I did feel confused at times what was Miles Morales Spider powers consisted of. I thought this film was interesting seeing various art styles come together in one film. I thought it was interesting how comic book bubbles are used in this film. I feel like this film was able to connect this film together better than many films. I wish we saw King Pen's family explained or seen better so we feel more for him loosing or help understand his motivation better. I wish we got a little bit on what is different between Aunt May's and Mary Jane Watson in those other universes. I liked that we got to hear the Sam Rami Uncle Ben voice in this film. This film does a great job getting the family theme and inner faith in self as a theme in this film to tie all these characters together in one film. The villain is fighting for family, There is a family feel that connects all the Spider characters because they each lost a family member and then you have Miles Family emphasized in this film. This film feels like a Avengers film while making Miles Morales the main focus. I wish we got more of the Green Goblin and Scorpion because I was least familiar with those versions of those characters. I liked the look of New York in this film. I liked Spider-Nors interest on A Rubics Cube. It was not till a second going that I recognized that the documentary playing when Miles Moralis walks into class is Dr. Olivia Octavius speaking about other dimensions. I think I like some of the music and other times I am not into it. Like I liked the motif used for the Prowler scenes. Or I liked the music playing after Miles is bitten and he is first experiencing his powers. I found the music was unique in that there was so much diversity in types of styles of music even in the score. ",

            "content": "IT'S RAINING SPIDER-MEN - My Review of SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE (4 Stars)\n\nMy distaste for superhero films has been well-documented, so consider my surprise that I actually found myself not only loving one, but remembering what I've seen!  Consider that a major achievement with SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE, while still filled with all of the Marvel trappings I've grown so bored with, triumphs BECAUSE it's animated.  \n\nLive action comic book movies always feel like a bunch of actors in Halloween costumes standing in front of green screens playing out simple black and white storylines.  With acting as stilted as the old Sword And Sandals Epics of yesteryear, I preferred seeking out the gray areas in other genres more in keeping with my tastes.  With this new film, the genre feels more at home as an animated feature, especially because the animation feels so alive.  Because you can literally do anything, the impossible action feels credible and the approximation to reading a comic gets its just due.  Additionally, unlike its wooden predecessors, the voice acting pops with one memorable turn after another, and it doesn't hurt that diversity rules in a traditionally white story.  \n\nWritten by Phil Lord (THE LEGO MOVIE), comedy writer Rodney Rothman and directed by Rothman along with Bob Persichetti and Peter Ramsey, the film snaps and crackle with self-reflective humor reminiscent of DEADPOOL and, no surprise, the LEGO movies, but it finds enormous warmth with Shameik Moore's portrayal of Miles Morales, who, like Peter Parker (voiced here by Chris Pine), gets bitten by a radioactive spider and finds himself with the same superpowers. Faster than you can say \"Malkovich, Malkovich\", more Spider-folks emerge when an accident threatens the lives of his counterparts from other dimensions.  Those include a pig named Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), Peni Parker, an anime-style girl voiced by Kimiko Glenn, and Spider-Man Noir, a hardboiled detective played by Nicolas Cage.  Each incarnation gets their own filmmaking style, turning the film into a delightful genre blend.  Its overall animation has such a fluidity to it as well as glorious \"steadi-cam\" shots and thrilling action sequences.  Add a terrific Kathryn Hahn as the delightful lab nerd, Doc Ock, Hailee Steinfeld as a very independent, misanthropic Gwen Stacy, Liev Schreiber as the big bad guy, the winning voice of Brian Tyree Henry as Miles' strict police officer father, Mahershala Ali as Miles' freewheeling Uncle Aaron, Lily Tomlin as the most fierce Aunt May yet and Jake Johnson practically stealing the film as a Peter Parker from another dimension, and you have one of the best voiceover casts I've seen in an animated film.  \n\nYes, the plot and the giant cast feels overstuffed at times, but it remains a quite charming experience throughout.  Miles' hero's journey includes the usual \"get off your ass and do something selfless' tropes, but his nerdy, humble demeanor brings joy to the film in ways that the usual stoic super-whatevers never achieve.  The nonsense surrounding the \"collider\" and fixing it before everyone dies isn't as interesting as watching Miles try to cozy up to Gwen, who just isn't having it.  Despite this, the chase sequence through the woods outside the lab thrilled me in ways I haven't seen since Luke and Leia went on a speeder chase through the Endor forest. The film also has some surprising reveals and a dynamic and literal page-turning quality to the storytelling.  I was reminded of And Lee's HULK in this regard, but again, the animation sells this quality way better than live action.  \n\nI don't want to overpraise this film, because I'll likely forget most of it anyhow, but I will remember its eye-popping style and attention to character.  It's a meta good time at the movies where for once, the calorie count in your popcorn doesn't exceed the surplus of all the good ones on the screen.",

The only reason I saw it was becarse some people either asked me if I have and if not, I need to see it. Well, to be honest, it was ok. It was very slow to start. I almost dozed off several times watching it. It wasn\u2019t until towards the end I really got into it. Personally I do not like Spider-Man. I\u2019m not fan of him. I think because it has been done to death and well, he is just not interesting to me anymore. When I was a kid I loved him, and I can see why this movie has high ratings because if I was that kid I would give it a 10 rating but I\u2019m not. The movie had some cool animation to it, but some of the action sequences were a bit choppy and sometimes hard to follow. Although the story was solid and easy to follow, with a dash of humor to make it a little more fun, the direction of style staying true to a comic book look and feel I\u2019m not a fan of. Just like the original movie movie Hulk (the first one) was done the same way and I just don\u2019t like it. That is my preference. Either be s movie or be a comic book, but for this movie it worked better then being s live action movie. I really loved the message it brought, about taking a leap of faith, becarse you want know unless you just do it! I don\u2019t want to spoil the movie only to say it was entertaining but it wasn\u2019t all that as much as people or reviews lead me to believe. I give the film a 7 out of 10. Only because it\u2019s a cartoon animated film and by comparison to others movies similar to this one, like \u201cThe incredibles\u201d which is way better than this movie. It gets a B- rating.",

Who demanded to have a promise be kept, for both their sake. The mantle has been carried onto multiple dimensions featuring yet another Spider-Man/ Peter Parker (Jake Johnson) who clumsily yet willingly teaches Miles the ropes to being a true hero.

            "content": "I have not enjoyed myself so much in a theater these last couple years (maybe longer) as I had seeing this film. From minute one, this movie had me grinning from ear-to-ear and it never stopped. First, I have to mention the animated motif/aesthetic the production crew went for here. For the first time, I truly felt like the pages of a comic book were properly \"translated\" to the silver screen instead of being recreated or adapted into the film medium (as distinguished by the ink dots used to make up larger images being clearly visible); that, along with the sounds effect cues, just make the animated panels pop off the screen in a brilliant way. There is so much detail to make out in each visual, which works both to the film's benefit as well as its detriment (I wish I could have seen what was going on better in some of the more-frenetic, snappy fight scenes). Additionally, it was a nice touch incorporating appropriate styles for the \"spider-characters\" pulled from their varied universes. I also must give a shout-out to the casting department for pulling fantastic performances out of all of the voice actors. Shamiek Moore IS Miles Morales for me, no matter what; he just embodies the character so well that I wish I could see him take on the role in a live-action movie. I also thought Jake Johnson's version of the sad-sack Peter B. Parker was a fun, hilarious inversion of the conventional Spider-Man we've read about for almost six decades now. Hailee Steinfeld, a performer I have rarely been a fan of, added a spark of life to Spider-Gwen/Gwen Stacy, as well. In spite of wanting more running time from the flick to develop their characters, Nick Cage and John Mulaney provide great supporting parts as Spider-Man Noir and Spider-Ham, respectively. Though he cannot measure up to Dn'Ofrio's Netflix counterpart, Liev Schreiber displays enough dimensions to his Wilson Fisk/Kingpin to make him more than a broad, menacing figure. Other actors I won't name here pitch in awesome additional cameos. For me, the best part of the film, though, is that it never loses sight of its main character and HIS story. I may already be familiar with his background as a reader of Marvel's Ultimate line of comics, but even if I was not well-versed in Miles' life, the film does an admirable job of offering viewers a reason to CARE about this kid; you want to root for him to succeed even before he inherits the powers, grapples with the responsibility, and ultimately becomes a \"Spider-Man.\" Add to all that a heartfelt tribute to the recently-passed co-creators of this world, the late Steve Ditko and Stan Lee, and some inspiring messages for younger audiences and you've got yourself a winner. Despite not caring for most of the hip-hop music (along with my other minor complaints above), this is now my second-favorite \"Spider-Man\" movie of them all. I encourage every person - big, small, whatever - and their families to head out and watch this movie as soon as possible!",

I was particularly not a fan of Kingpin\u2019s design, and the stylization of the art and such are used to gloss over some contrivances in the final battle that don\u2019t really make sense.

Not sure how but probably with the help of the Sinister Six. I feel that way, it makes a good connection to the series now that the show is cancelled. It also makes Kingpin a much greater villain in the MCU as he is in this Movie's universe.",

The story is fascinating; by not focusing on Peter Parker as the main character, it manages to explore stories and ideas that never have been explored more. Miles Morales is a very intriguing character. He is very desperate to succeed in life, and yet is afraid to at the same time, as he knows the true consequences of following your dreams and what you must leave behind. He is almost like Peter Parker from the MCU in a way. Additionally, the film fully fleshes our Peter Parker in this movie, and all the struggles he goes through as a superhero, even when he\u2019s living the high life. But the film\u2019s ultimate high point is the animation. Seriously, the animation is enough to see the movie even if you\u2019re not interested in the story. It takes all the elements from a comic book and uses it to its advantage. It\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. It is clear that it took a lot of people to make these effects possible, and all the work definitely paid off. Spider-Verse attempts to change both the animated and superhero genres, and succeeds on an extremely high note. ",

            "content": "I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)m not sure what I can add to what has already been said about this film. I had watched an Angry Joe review before I was even aware of this film and I have to admit that it is everything I had wanted the Toby McGuire Spider-man to be, I had never bothered with the second Andrew Garfield film after seeing the painful amount of plot holes, idiot balls, and the terrible extent they made Garfield\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s version of Peter Parker into a Gary-Stu character. I hadn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t been a fan of Garfield\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s acting, but the script and character they gave him was awful and I don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t blame him for the failures of those films. I didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t bother to watch Homecoming, partly because of the sheer saturation of Marvel films, and partly because I just couldn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t find it in me to view the character of Peter Parker as interesting anymore.\n\nI loved the 90s Spider-man cartoons. Among US cartoons, it and Batman had been my two favorites, but the McGuire films were chalk full of stupid writing compared to the brilliant, analytical, and empathetic cartoon version of Spider-Man. It wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t always perfect, of course. However, the writing, plots, scenarios, and characterizations were so far above everything that either the Toby McGuire films and Garfield films always failed to capture. Peter Parker wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t just some stupid kid going through puberty; he was a brilliant, analytical, and compassionate individual who thought through serious issues, grappled with life-death circumstances on a weekly basis, and showed compassion throughout. Perhaps my love for the 90s cartoons skewed my views, because evidently that wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t Comic-book Spider-Man. I knew I would never see that brilliant version of Peter Parker again, but to repeatedly see from new cartoon series to films . . . this stale, average, and frankly stupid Spider-Man really killed any love I had for the character and series. Over time, I grew to detest the character of Peter Parker too and got sick of the franchise as a whole. I suppose I became a jaded Spider-Man hater, because the writing of all these stories had been so damn terrible compared to the 90s cartoon.\n\nThis film has absolutely changed that for me. Miles Morales feels like a fresh start to a new Spider-Man. The comedy is top-notch, the characters have real depth that is shockingly on par with the 90s cartoons, and everything I missed about Spider-Man has been reshaped and re-imagined with this new Spider-Man and the phenomenal writing of this film. I highly recommend Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. It captures everything I missed about the 90s Spider-Man, adds genuinely hilarious humor unlike most Hollywood films, it has great music that is executed with wonderfully, it does absolutely stunning work with visuals far above and beyond anything previously done with the Spider-Man franchise and that isn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t a hyperbole, and I loved all the characters and their individual stories.\n\nIf you\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)re even slightly considering watching Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, I highly recommend it. I really feel this film outshines everything before it. Gwyn Stacy and Mary Jane are both actually interesting for once, the characters are all exceptionally developed, the origin feels far more fresh than the overused Peter Parker storyline, and Miles is more interesting and brilliant as a lead character than any of the previous Peter Parkers since the 90s Spider-Man cartoon.",

Man, it's hard to believe that this is the same company who made the Emoji Movie. It's crazy. Everything felt so beautiful and I think the visuals are what stuck with me the most. \n\nSTORY: I thought the pacing was a little bad. Too slow at points, mostly with dialogue, or too fast in moments that could be strung out a little more. This caused confusion with what the heck was going on near the end, but hey! It was pretty so honestly I can figure that out later.\n\nPredictability: I came into this movie knowing nothing. It's not what I was expecting, but still good nonetheless. I'm not going to spoil anything, but there were some moments that, yes, were surprising, but the unsatisfying part about is that there was absolutely 0 foreshadowing. I'm sure it's answered in the comics but for the general viewer it was just kind of like: \"woah, they're that now... huh.\" On the other hand, what I thought was the most unpredictable part was how dark it was! I can't exactly spoil anything but man!! It was incredibly dark for what I thought was a PG movie. \n\nScore: I'm a soundtrack lover. It's my favorite type of music. So naturally, it sticks out when I watch the movie. I haven't listened to it directly yet but from what I picked up in the movie it was brilliant. I would have liked a little more character themes but honestly what I got was so fantastic that I wish I had gotten more. Spider Ham and Prowler had some of the best themes that stuck out to me.",

The trailer wasn't so clear about its animation, or the very bold storyline! When I went to see this movie I was blown away by the striking animation and the bold storytelling.. I think it's a very risky step for Sony to take, to make a very unique, new and comic-alike animation, I mean what if the audience didn't like it? It could have been a big disappointing movie, because it has an amazing story, I think this story is definitely the best story of the whole Spiderman movies, also the animation is amazing, it's flawless! When an animation movie brings the live-action movies down, it means that it's definitely unique and bold!!\n\nThe story didn't take so long to get you into the main plot, it went with its surprising \"scene\" -I'm not gonna spoil anything in this review- and though it made a very good introduction of the characters, so the first act was very good, shocking and humorous too!\n\nThe second act still a very funny and thrilling as the first act, introducing the rest of the characters, so it took more time to get us back to the main plot, and I loved it, because some characters wasn't that clear in the first act that I wanted to know more about, and others that I wanted more of their backstories because I liked them! After introducing the \"rest of the characters\" we get another shocking scene, driving us to another shocking scene.. excuse me if I'm mysterious about some stuff, but I don't want to spoil anything, and still, if you watched the movie, you're gonna understand me very well.\n\nThe third act was very predictable though, but still very thrilling because of its amazing animation combined with the amazing action, and emotions... Oh yeah, the third act is completely emotional, and action-full!\n\nThere're not any subplots like Fantastic Beasts the Crimes of Grindelwald or something, it's very straight and clear.. very good for kids, and amazing for Spider-man fans and adults as well.\n\nI think that Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse is the Spider-Man that we deserve as fans of Spider-Man and it's definitely the best Spider-Man movie of all the time.! And of course, Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse gets an A+!\n\nAlright, guys.. thank you as always for reading and supporting my work, and if you liked this you can click on my name above and read all of my reviews, lots of movie-reviews are coming ahead.. thanks again!",

Into The Spiderverse understands that spiderman already is cool and that's why he's so popular of a character even after all these years. you can tell the impact of this movie from seeing this movie from the way the voice cast talks about it in interviews.

Introducing a new take on Spider-Man and the identity of heroes in general, while cleverly acknowledging all the previous Spider-Man movies, this movie stands out as a unique storytelling contribution...Really!  Plus, the dialogue is funny and clever and the various spider characters are likeable.  The animation style is also outstanding, at least until the end when the setting seems to dissolve into a directionless space...partly related to the story, but annoying and unsatisfying to me nonetheless.  I like the simplicity of the antagonist story, with more focus on the world and the characters than on an overly complicated and unbelievable set of contingencies passed off as an \"evil plan\".  \n\nHowever, the relationships were overly sappy and well-trodden territory for kids movies, particularly the father-son relationship.  And the rapidity of the plot (it all takes just a couple days) is also a typical flaw of action movies in general, compounded by the deep soul-felt bonds that form among the characters here.

However, when I saw into the Spider verse I got the amazing feeling I got after I saw the first Incredibles. The sense of awe and anticipation was with me all throughout this film. I have seen it 3 times so far, and I intend to see it again. I have rarely seen movies more than once at a theater but this film continuously makes me want to see it again and again. This film is definitely something that you can't miss",

Since it's the first film of its kind, the visuals feel very fresh.\n\nPlot: It ended up being more similar to The Lego Movie than I had expected, but it was still a good story. \n\nCharacters: Wow. I ended up feeling for almost every character in the movie as it went on. Even the bad guy, while a little mainstream, does a good job of avoiding being clich\u00c3 (C).\n\nSoundtrack: The tracks are different but fitting, going along with the main character's personality very well. It still feels very fresh to have another superhero movie without the standard orchestral track.\n\nOverall rating: 10/10",

Kingpin has introduced a weapon designed to open alternative dimensions creating a scenario where multiple versions of Spiderman can exist. This allows for the possibility of multiple animation styles and the theme anyone can be Spiderman given the opportunity.\n\nWe are soon introduced to Miles Morales who is a teenager trying to find his way. His father is focused on him following through with his education while his uncle tries to foster his creative spirit. He is pulled between two forces trying to decide his place in the world while also dealing with the regular struggles of being a teenager. His life changes when he is bitten by a radioactive spider navigating a new sense of the world around him.\n\nThe animation in this picture is beautiful playing well off each other with the different styles but you do not feel the transition. Each animation style has its place and is blended well so you are not jarred by all the changes. Every hero from different universes have distinctive personalities and show Miles what it really takes to be a hero. An overweight Peter B. Parker serves as his mentor throughout the process trying to show Miles it is not just about being the strongest. He is shown how a hero responds to overwhelming adversity and Kingpin is a formidable villain combining both strength and intelligence. \n\nMiles has a lot of insecurity and his struggles to assume the mantle as a Spiderman in his universe is understandable. A lot has been thrust at him recently and part of his trouble stems from trying to wrap his mind around it all. His navigation of new-found superpowers are cringe worthy but also humorous in his clumsy attempts trying to bring the powers under his control.\n\nPeter B. Parker and Gwen Stacy are the highlights of the supporting characters. Gwen brings the heart and helps ground him when he is struggling. Peter B. Parker is demanding of Miles trying to draw out the best in him and test his mettle. He expresses how he has fallen to the wayside himself and does not want Miles to fall down that path. Each version of Spiderman is a well realized individual with clearly expressed weaknesses and personal struggles they are trying to overcome.\nThere are many moments where you see the relationship between Miles and his father shift. This is the real ability of the movie to make the relationships feel real and that there are consequences for every action. Trying to find his identity is something we can all relate to and Miles is a character with real personal growth. A maturity comes out of his character at the end of the film but we still get the sense this is a child traveling through adulthood.\n\nThere is not a lot about the different versions of Spiderman and sometimes they are hastily introduced. One or two fewer Spiderman might have been in order to ensure a more streamlined film. Sometimes, you do not care you do not know much about them because the film moves at a swift pace. The story flows well together and the dynamics between the characters is a real highlight of the movie. Miles embodies an ordinary teenager going through relatable struggles with the ultimate message where anyone can be a hero. The message shows you can be extraordinary by just being yourself and not looking to be something else.",

            "content": "When going into Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse I was very excited. I had been reading Miles Morales since 2014 alongside Kamala Khan, and while I never loved him as much as I loved Kamala I had always enjoyed the story of Miles in the Ultimate Universe. He felt different from Peter Parker as he was more grounded in his responsibility to his family first. He was never defined by some major death of a family member the way Peter was, but rather instead by the loss of his Peter Parker. He became Spider-Man to honor his Peter's legacy, and that felt like a solid motivation to me.\n\nBack in the Ultimate Universe era Bendis was on a hot streak with Jessica Jones, Daredevil, and other street level heroes. This fine tuned writing really did well for the Ultimate Spider-Man as he would eventually create a really powerful bond between 616 Peter Parker and the 1610 one, and it was this relationship that I was elated to see get portrayed on the big screen.\n\nHowever there was one major worry I had about this film, and that was the entire concept of the spider verse. I just never liked the idea of a billion spider characters all coming together in one big giant event, and I defiantly didn't want it in Miles's first movie when he should be the focus. It also made me feel like these writers didn't think Miles could stand on his own which also irked me. Luckily though in the film these other characters don't take away from the character of Miles Morales as the film still revolves around him. The other Spider characters are kind of just there to help felt the big bad, and because the film is still called \"Into the Spider-Verse,\" but there not major. I did like Spider-Man Noir a lot, and also Penni Parker was cool too.\n\nIn regards to the animation for the film I felt it always looked pretty crisp and clean. I liked the style of allowing a comic book come to life in animation. It allows for it to feel more realistic, and for the colors to start to pop. You can tell that the writers put a lot of love and care when crafting this film with the stylization in mind. It is something that is both amazing and spectacular. Pun intended. :-P\n\nThere is quite a lot in the film that pulls from Miles's story in the Ultimate Universe. I really enjoyed seeing Ultimate Green Goblin realized on the big screen, and his battle against Peter Parker was absolutely great. I also loved the death of Ultimate Peter Parker as it both dark and brutal. I literally started to have goosebumps in the theater when watching. There was also the bond between Aaron Davis and Miles that was captured perfectly, and when Aaron died it felt like my soul left my body. \n\nThat being said despite my love for this scene I did find Aaron's death to be a bit problematic. It makes Miles lose some of his individuality in my opinion. And with the movie trying so hard to get us to see that Miles is more than a Peter Parker knock off the idea that Miles would need another major loss to define him really undercuts his development. Especially when we have a more compelling story to tell with his relationship with his Uncle were Miles is caught between the world of crime and the world of a hero.\n\nGoing into some performances I thought everyone did a pretty solid job. I thought Chris Pine's portrayal of Peter Parker was very original and a different take on the character. I found Jake Johnson's Peter to be absolutely amazing and quite memorable too. Hailee Steinfeild as Gwen Stacy was perfect casting in my opinion, and her friendship that she created with Miles was really heartfelt. And I can't wait for that to be developed more if we ever get a sequel to this movie.\n\nOverall this was a exceptional film with a really heartfelt story. It understands what makes Miles a really compelling character, and was just a lot of fun to watch on screen, and so for that reason and others I truly believe that this movie deserves many accolades.",

It does so with a freshness and sensitivity that bespeaks what we need in our time and renders all that is comforting and familiar about the paper comics we love supplanted under and on top of judiciously rendered CGI. I loved the movie because it entertains with heart, and passes the torch to the newest spidey in the first blatantly rational way ever. It is a tribute to the way the fans adore and mold these characters, and how that adoration takes all shapes and forms over the world and through time. This amazing entry from Marvel gives tribute to its roots, to its fans, to diversity...and tribute to the venerable Mr. Lee in a most satisfying way. ",

The pace of this movie is so fast that it reminds me of an Edgar Wright film which is never a bad thing. The soundtrack is also unbelievably spectacular and makes the film even easier to watch than it already was.

Behind the camera Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman delivers a story that manages to balance to the numerous Spider characters (the film is brimming with Easter Eggs) with a story about how Miles Morales steps into the role of Spider-Man.  It's not just the heroes that get a great showcase, but also the villains (Kingpin has real motivation behind his plan, while Prowler is probably the coolest he's ever been) and supporting cast (this might just be the best version of Aunt May).  The most brilliant innovation of the film is the animation and while the main style is absolutely gorgeous, looking like it came out of a comic book, when the different characters show up, it immediately changes style, from black & white noir to anime, while mixing in perfectly.  Simply put, this is the best Spider-Man movie ever along with easily being the best animated film of 2018 and the best comic book movie ever as well.",

In my opinion, these are the kind of superhero films we should be seeing a lot more of, and further proof why Marvel's cinematic universe continues to trounce that of DC. It's a film that knows how to be serious, but knows how to have fun, how to have deep, emotional characters without having them be sombre and morose. It's a magnificent visual spectacle, paying homage to the artistry of classic comic books, as well as using contemporary computer animation to make the film not look seamless and polished, but somewhat edgy and imperfect. The animation style looks like street graffiti brought to life, and some of the scenes are truly mind-blowing from the aesthetics alone. But its not just a treat for the eyes. Full of snappy dialogue, and built upon an exciting, subversive plot full of talented voice actors having the time of their lives, it's a tale of accepting responsibility and doing what's right, despite how overwhelmed or unqualified you believe yourself to be for the task. Phil Lord & Christopher Miler bring us the same visual panache and heart-warming sensibilities that made The Lego Movie such a joy to behold, and make Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse not just the best incarnation of the web-slinging superhero, but also one of 2018's absolute must-see movies.",

The soundtrack was incredible, and I added one of the songs to my personal playlist. And the most important part, the plot, was brilliant and beautifully crafted. Now this comes from someone that hasn\u00e2(TM)t read a proper comic book in her life. My stepdad loved them growing up, and his one problem with the movie was its villains and their differences between their comic book counterparts. I do, however, believe he\u00e2(TM)s not really right, considering that this is in a different dimension where things are slightly different than most other Spider Man stories. Overall, great family movie and worth a watch for sure.",

            "content": "If you thought Marvel movies were boring, this is the movie to change your mind. First and foremost - this is a piece of ART. Goddamn, the animation! A love letter to comic books AND cartoon styles, with a good dose of colour (as my friend Kelly put it, \"It's like the animators were on LSD!\") to boot. Just, gorgeous. And then there's the SOUNDTRACK! Atmospheric, moody, bass with a heart. The music was my personal favourite thing about the movie (that scene where they turn the volume up? Oh yeah.), because it reads like a character mixtape for Miles Morales, and I am HECKING ABOUT IT.\n\nNow let's talk about why I cried: leap of faith, family love, supportive camaraderie. But mostly that leap of faith. \"How will I know?\" \"You won't. You take a leap of faith.\" In a world wracked with uncertainty - where things most of us would never have predicted (*cough* elections *cough*) come to pass and reading the news can LITERALLY be anxiety-inducing, knowing you can fall back on faith is so important. Even more so when you consider the human condition is potentially, fundamentally lacking in knowledge. There are likely some questions we will never be able to answer (noumenon/phenomenon), so we need to be okay with uncertainty. More than that, we need to be able to keep going in the face of it. At some point, when you feel like there's nothing left, you gotta have faith in something. Because faith doesn't require evidence or rationality, it just needs your genuine conviction.\n\nAnd that brings me to resilience: \"Spiderman always gets back up.\" WHAT A TRAIT. WHAT A MESSAGE. The MCU likes to grapple with Big Issues (hello, Civil War), but with enough of a slant to feel completely conventional. I've argued before that superhero movies aren't just throwaway entertainment, because they are both outlets + inspirations for human heroes. But finally, a Marvel movie that tells you directly that you can be a hero! To your face, \"We are all Spiderman\" (and also that Stan Lee quote!). Because we have the potential to do good, and we really, really should try. But it's going to be a struggle, and when you fail, you gotta dust it off - hold onto that faith - and get back up. Spiderpeople do what need to be done, just because they should.\n\nOh, also, a good + experienced voice acting cast.\n\nSERIOUSLY though,  can we hang this up in a gallery?",

The writers really brought the character to life, making sure his culture is essential to the character since he is Afro-Latino (Black & Puerto Rican). So great to see Miles walking down the streets of Brooklyn talking to his friends in both English & Spanish. The other Spider-Man were used perfectly and were a blast as well. Beyond the story, the art style is what sets this movie apart from any other animated movie. The visuals are absolutely stunning, with some of the most breathtaking animation ever put to screen. It definitely changes what an animated movie should look like. It looks like it was pulled straight from the comics. The voice acting in this movie was impeccable. I mean they got Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir (THATS AWESOME). The story was very good and where it could\u2019ve gotten confusing they did a great job in explaining what was going on so that kids & adults will understand it. I can literally write for hours on how good this movie is but I might spoil some things. Overall I think this maybe one of the best adaptations of Spider-Man put to screen. I give it 10/10 \ud83d\udd78",

Lord and Miller once again bring life and humour to a varied cast, giving all our heroes memorable story arcs.

It's such a different feel then what is usually served up by other animation studios like Disney/Pixar. It has an engaging story, strong character development, loads of humour that really works, really strong voice cast; and is just an awesome fun ride. This film cleverly attempts to appeal to both kids and adults. Some of the alternate characters (Spider-Ham & Peni Parker) are clearly for the kids; however the film shocked me with its mature themes - Miles struggling to find his place in the world and an older Peter Parker dealing with divorce. Best Spider-Man movie ever made in my opinion. A must watch!",

            "content": "Over the last 16 years we've seen a lot of takes on Spider-Man, from three different actors, who were all good in their own ways. Now comes the most original and imaginative take yet, with no less than six version of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man Noire, Spider Gwen, Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham, and of course Miles Morales, Ultimate Spider Man.\n\nThe basic premise is that multiple versions of Spider Man from different universes meet up and unite against a common foe so that they can get home and prevent the walls of reality from crashing down. This will all make more sense if you have some familiarity with the comics, particularly Ultimate Spider Man and the recent Spider-Verse crossover. But even if you've never cracked a comic it's easy enough to follow. \n\nWhich is pretty impressive given that this movie has six heroes, six major villains, and a complex plot that hinges on theories of the multiverse. Narratively this movie does a really good job of covering a lot of ground in very little time.\n\nAnd it knows that not every character needs a lengthy origin story. In fact, the ones we do get become something of a running joke. And there are a lot of good jokes in this movie. Much like Tom Holland in Homecoming, Miles is hilariously awkward and inexperienced. His hallway encounter with Gwen is simultaneously one of the best, and most cringeworthy, meet cutes in recent years. There are plenty of jokes at the expense of Peter B Parker's visible paunch, and much is made of how (literally) black and white Spider Man Noire is. And Spider-Ham is downright hysterical.\n\nThe action scenes are fast paced and frantic, with the almost hallucinatory final battle being a real treat. Add in some standard but well-done family drama, some suspenseful close calls regarding the heroes' secret identities, and some genuinely surprising plot twists, and you get a well-rounded, highly entertaining picture.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is about the animation. For the most part it's quite good. I particularly enjoyed how Spider-Ham and some of the others are frequently animated in their original comic book style. But there are some times where the character's faces look sort of lifeless and well, weird. And in some of the faster paced action scenes, people and objects seemed to go slightly out of focus and blur around the edges. At first, I thought I'd walked into a 3D screening by mistake, but a quick scan showed that nobody else had on those funky glasses either. Maybe they were trying to go for a \"motion comic\" look, or maybe it was just the projector, but either way it was rather annoying.\n\nAs to whether this is the best Spider-Man movie yet, I honestly don't know. Homecoming set the bar pretty high. And it had Tony Stark. But this movie has Spider-Gwen. And a talking pig. And it's a wildly ambitious crossover that succeeds at all of its goals. It may be part of a well-worn genre, but Into the Spider-Verse has a lot more vision, wit, and originality than most movies this year. DC take note.",

First the CGI animation is really good, it really is like turning comic book images into 3D. The story flows very naturally like water, and there are a lot of twists which are not just great but simply breathtaking. \n\nThis truly is one of the very best Spiderman movies even though it is just CGI. A Must See for me, and I will definitely watch it again, probably when it becomes available on Google Movies. \n\nLastly, trust a Marvel superhero movie like this to compete with DC's live action \"Aquaman\" movie and yet still come out on top in terms of quality, LOL.",

Wow what a change of voice from that to hearing him in Atlanta. . . . Glad to hear his vocal talents. This story is very comic book forward so I understand why this movie had to be animated and hope they never bring Miles into live action because that would just kill the franchise.

Shameik Moore (Miles Morales) completely nails everything that is needed of this lead. Jake Johnson (Peter B. Parker) is hilarious as a disheveled version of the famous hero. It can be difficult to get comedic stuff across through voice only, but Johnson feels like he was born for it. I loved this take on the character. Hailee Steinfeld (Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman) is great, while Liev Schreiber (Wilson Fisk/Kingpin) and Katheryn Hahn (Olivia Octavius/Doctor Octopus) made for good villains. There\u00e2(TM)s also good efforts from Brian Tyree Henry (Jefferson Davis) and Kimiko Glenn (Peni Parker). However, the show stealers had to be John Mulaney (Peter Porker/Spider-Ham) and Nicholas Cage (Peter Parker/Spider-Man Noir). Both are funny, with the latter killing it in each line. The delivery is expert from Cage. I\u00e2(TM)m a sucker for unique animation styles and this movie is gorgeous. It feels just like a comic book and is the kind of thing you need to see on the big screen or in as high quality as possible. The script is sharp, with each character getting enough time to shine and feel fully developed. The dialogue feels fresh, funny, and never forced. I love the overall plot and how the focus is on Miles growing into the role of a superhero while also dealing with his family issues. Throw in a TON of nods to the comics, games, TV shows, and movies of Spider-Man\u00e2(TM)s past, and you\u00e2(TM)ve got a true winner.\n\nWeaknesses: Honestly, I can\u00e2(TM)t really think of any. This movie has it all.\n\nOverall: We\u00e2(TM)ve had so many Spider-Man movies in history and somehow, the ninth to feature the character feels the freshest. The filmmakers got every little thing right. From the animation to the voice acting to the story to the history to the post-credits scene. Outstanding.",

A nice fun way of telling the nobody hero trope and then elevating it with fun characters and engaging character relationships and development. With nice callbacks to the style of vintage comics, references, and Stan Lee, this is the spider man movie that tops the others. Miles' character is fun and compelling as he goes from a nobody to the next new spider man. He calls back to past scenes throughout the movie which helps him learn and fight. Plus the fun can take any turn since it isn't part of the MCU. Peter B Parker is the nice but more realistic mentor, spider ham is cartoonishly fun, Peni is kawaii, noir is the most interesting one of the bunch, and spider Gwen is also a plus. The villains are also fun with a twist. For both the prowler and kingpin. Though some of the villains motivations aren't fully told or shown, kingpin's is and it's understandable the lengths he goes to. Overall one of the best movie of 2018.",

I was solidly blown away by Spider-man Into The Spider-Verse. \n\nThe animation, the story, the characters, the motives, the twists, the hero's start, fall, and rise, all of it was an experience that I will remember for a long time. \n\nIf you are hesitant about seeing an animated spider-man in theaters, toss that hesitation aside and \"THWIP!\" on over to the nearest one. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an ambitious. Sony's last few attempts with the character of Spider-Man have been underwhelming to say the least. I haven't seen a good Sony owned Spider-Man movie since 2004's Spider-Man 2. Luckily, Spider-Man: Homecoming turned out to be a pretty good film, but that was mainly Disney and Marvel Studios, so I still had low expectations. However, I am happy to say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an awesome Spider-Man film, and an amazing film overall. \nInstead of following Peter Parker like every other Spider-Man film out there, this film instead tells the story of Miles Morales and how he handles being Spider-Man. This is a bit different, however, because instead of skipping the learning and the suit making, we see his struggles firsthand. Miles makes a promise to his world's original Spider-Man that he would put a stop to Kingpin, but he has no idea how to control his powers, so he has a hard time.\nLuckily, Kingpin's fancy collider machine happens to bring in some other Spider-Man, as well, so that Miles can get the help that he needs. The best part about this film is the way the characters are handled. The writers understand the character of Spider-Man, no matter what dimension he/she is from. They all have different personalities and art styles that make them stand out from each other. They did such a great job that I now want to see spin-off films for all of the Spider-Men in this movie. \nInto the Spider-Verse is a lighthearted film, and is able to mix seriousness with comedy for the perfect effect. From the comedy aspect, the film, as I said before, understands Spider-Man. He is a funny character and knows how to stay calm in any situation. He cracks goofy jokes and says witty one-liners. With this movie, the different personalities of the different Spider-Men mixing together brings the comedy. On the other hand, the serious family issues bring some conflict to different characters, but in order to keep this spoiler free, I will not go in depth. \nThere is one issue I have with the film, but it isn't too big. Okay, the character is too big, but the issue is not. Kingpin, I feel, needed more characterization in order for me to think of him as a good villain. We learned some things about his family, but that was really it. He was a just a large man who wanted to conduct an evil plot. I can look past this, however, because the movie wasn't really focused on Kingpin. It was more focused on the Spider-Men, and most importantly, Miles Morales. Since this was done so well, I can forgive the film the Kingpin issue. \nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a film that was much needed on Sony's part, because it shows that they still have good things they can do with the character. Animation, I feel, is the best format for Spider-Man, but that might be because I grew up watching the Spider-Man animated series. Overall, this is an awesome film, and definitely deserves a watch. If you are a Spider-Man fan, I believe you will truly adore this movie as much as I did. If you are a heavy critic who doesn't know much about the character of Spider-Man, I think you will enjoy this movie too. If you just like movies in general, go out and see this movie. It's worth it.",

Sony took a big risk and extra time to try and create a comic book movie we have never seen before and they succeeded.\n\nThe style of the halftone patterns and chromatic aberrations make you feel like you're watching an old comic book (complete with registration printing issues) come to life before your very eyes. The story is great and the characters are endearing. Sony is able to make fun of themselves with good humor in one scene and create very serious scenes in the next moment.\nProps to Sony on making a PG comic book movie that kids of all ages can love. Although I recommend nine or older as some scenes are intense.\n\nWarning for spoilers below...\n\nI enjoyed all the characters except for Spider-Pig. He seemed to be thrown in for comic relief, but the best jokes were nothing to do with him. Perhaps he tests well with a younger audience?",

            "content": "One of, if not the Best Spider-Man movie ever made. And not only that...one of the most amazingly animated movies out there. It is a film a whole slew of cinema fans will be able to dissect, though ultimately enjoy. \n\n  Its timeless and at the same time very much emblematic of our time, culturally and taste wise in our multi-media. \n\n  This at first seemed to be a Pascal decision, to really dry this deal out and milk it for what its worth. Pessimism proven properly wrong. \n\nTHANK THE LORDS it is treated as a cinematic piece, an extension of the films, comics, graphic novels, video games and cartoons through the years- rather than anything you\u00e2(TM)d anticipate considering who green lit it and the fact we already have an \u00e2Oh he\u00e2(TM)s fine\u00e2?- Spider-Man in the MCU and currently out there in pop culture and cinema. This film has a post-modern edge whilst ratcheting up the bonkers world and content. But its realky weighted by its soul and heart. It doesn\u00e2(TM)t feel like a re-tread we have felt the past 11 years since Spider-Man 3. \nIts an injection of fresh ways to tell a story. \n\n  You think the re-repeat of a Spider-Mans origin induces, we get Five here. All so hilariously told and never thematically or stylistically breaking the overall aesthetic and wholly unique thumbprint. \n\n  Aside from Raimi\u00e2(TM)s (not so much part 3, which gets a great rinse in this film) Spider-Man as a live  action experience has been lack-lustre; whereas this film proves to me Spider-Mans future is safe in these creatives/writers/directors hands and kept as an animated movie series.\nThere is so much room to play, invent, push for laughs and not be tied down by any form of MCU concrete continuity. \n  \n   I have a deep feeling, considering this film was championed by Amy Pascal, that it was down to her, that and Avi Arad\u00e2(TM)s experience in the cartoon world and his passion for that medium that saw this abled to be such a strong evocative film experience. \n  Really supporting Bob Persichetti,\nPeter Ramsey, Phil Lord and \nRodney Rothman\u00e2(TM)s vision. \n\n  Its such a joyous impactful emotional ride pushed by the visuals and Daniel Pemberton\u00e2(TM)s mesmeric up-lifting, energetic- emotionally driven score. \n \n  A unique inventive heart-felt hilarious action-packed visual surrealist commercially relevant driven carefully and passionately crafted piece of cinema. \n   \nThe voice-cast bring Peter Parker in his many variations to life. \n  Specifically, Jake Johnson giving us an aged, portly and disenfranchised, and suicidal Parker. Melancholy, yet really easing into that role-model rol for Miles, the rest of the team taking up little of the slack all focuses on their own goals. \n  Really giving us a funny, self referential, sardonic version we\u00e2(TM)ve yet to ever experience. \n \n  And the rest of his multiple guises and variants are perfectly cast, especially a, on top form gung ho- vocal performance from Nicolas Cage as Spider-Noir, excelling in the role abd freedom voice work obviously offers him as a creative. \n\n  Shameik Moore brings Miles Morales beautifully to life.  This is also the greatest Wilson Fisk on screen alongside what we have from Vincent D'Onofrio\u00e2(TM)s version in Netflix\u00e2(TM)s Daredevil series; here voiced by a enthusiastic Liev Schreiber, obviously relishing the freedom voice work offers actors of his and Cages ilk. \n\nPlease see it! And experience the greatest superhero film in the past decade. \n\nMy favourite film of the year. Hands down. I utterly adore it.",

Some reviewers are saying that they are not Spider-Man fanboys and therefore were lost in all the characters which I think is false, the production did a good job at introducing the different people in the movie. \n\nA couple other things to notice are that the visuals in this movie are refreshingly new, the movie is basically a comic book being broadcasted to your eyes. Also the music is current and fits incredibly well with the feel of the movie (*typed while listening to the soundtrack*)\n \nMy only complaint was when the credits stopped rolling which meant I couldn't watch it anymore.\n\nHonestly I had given up on Sony portraying my favorite superhero but felt I'd give it a shot. If you enjoy cartoons, superheroes, an incredible story, stunning visuals or a great soundtrack, then it is absolutely worth the money to see this movie",

The art was AMAZING and absolutely inspiring. I was captivated from the first second it started until the very end. The soundtrack was fantastic. One thing I really loved was the emotion they were able to bring into the film. I was legitimately scared of the Prowler and the music they played whenever he was around. The character development was great, and everything flowed very well. I have never EVER seen a movie so visually pleasing to watch. This is the best animated movie I have ever seen and I really believe it has pushed the boundaries for animation. INCREDIBLE. This movie is a must see. I loved the way the comics and other movies had tie ins to this one, it was super cool to watch that. There were also some clever easter eggs in the movie. WOW. Just wow.

The plot is handled with respect, and the Stan Lee cameos keep getting better.  I can understand from an artist's perspective the choices made or inspired by.  The render look is inspired by Telltale Games design choices for their Walking Dead and Batman games.  You could even go so far as to say the Borderlands games.  The stuttering animation is what animation does best. Less frames equals shorter render times equals more attention to other things.  I really enjoyed the dot gain textures / materials used to light the character during key moments too.  Natural without being overwhelming.  The main character and his world feel genuinely real.  His relationships make you smile, and the plot twists as fast as Spidey can spin on a web. Good comedic timing also leverage between heavy action sequences- a staple from the best Spidey writers.  Marvel has once thought the idea of a multi-verse was poor writing and was a staple calling card from what kept them different then DC. (Keeping an eye on continuity which hasn't been easy.) Now they're playing the alternate dimensions in spades and it has given their franchise character new life. This is the film that has born an infinite business for Marvel.  Now only if they can just keep us all alive long enough to enjoy them all, that's the real trick.",

I'm a simple guy. I walk into an animated movie, I ask for two things. Number one -- tell me an interesting story. And number two -- make it look good. And, dear God, does this do both of those things to an almost excruciatingly original degree. Add my favorite Marvel character and one of my favorite working creatives -- Phil Lord -- into that mix and you get something I never even realized could turn out as objectively magnificent as this. This is a fantastically deep study on not only what the idea of \"Spider-Man\" means to the characters within the film, but what it means to all people -- including the audience. Spider-Man, the movie posits, is not just a hero, an example, or a cultural fixture, but a mechanism to help people believe in things bigger than themselves. Yes, the movie is that deep.

            "content": "I\u2019ve always been a strong advocate for getting Spider-Man back into the MCU, because I want one of my favorite characters to be the way I know and love him. Now that he is back in the fold, I was quite concerned when I heard that Sony was also going to be making a strange off-shoot story about Miles Morales. It was definitely a bold choice to make an alternate dimension Spider-Man film at the same time as Tom Holland is crushing it with the Avengers, but this is one gamble that paid off big time. By creating an alternate universe for this film to take place in, one that is only slightly different from the one we know, the creative team has free rein to do anything they want. It\u2019s a hilarious film that had the theater buzzing with laughter from beginning to end. The different Spider-People that are introduced all have unique voices that perfectly fit their character. I adored how we were given the history of each new character as we met them, and each time it\u2019s just enough information to get to know the character without overwhelming us with a 20-minute-long origin story. There\u2019s also a surprising amount of heart to this film. Spider-Man is famous for being a character whose history is defined by tragedy, and I thought they did a great job of hitting some similar themes for Miles as well. But there was one moment in the film where they were aiming for more emotion, but I didn\u2019t feel it was effective because the character involved was kind of minor and they lingered longer than that moment deserved. It wasn\u2019t a problem, though, because the action picked back up immediately after that moment. That\u2019s one thing you\u2019ll get in spades with Into the Spider-Verse\u2026action. It is constant and thrilling, and the visuals were captured beautifully. I loved how they embraced the fact that the film was animated and utilized that to make it more like a comic book. Several times they would put thought bubbles on screen, insert a sound effect written on screen, and other tricks that comic book artists will use. It was both fitting and humorous at the same time. I\u2019m surprised with the number of directors they were able to work together so well to get such a cohesive vision. Miles Morales is a character that I only knew from reputation, because he was introduced after I had stopped reading comic books. I like the differences and similarities of this character to Peter Parker. He has his own unique style, some special powers, but still shares some personality traits with the Spider-Man we all know. His family situation was handled well in the film, and I liked the fact that they didn\u2019t go down the road of vilifying his Dad, which felt like a real possibility. They also introduced a number of familiar villains from the comics, all hired by Kingpin. I loved the fact that Kingpin himself had genuine motivations instead of just being a psychotic mad man. My only real complaint with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was the chaos of the climactic scene. By this point they had introduced a lot of characters, both good and bad, so it was difficult to keep track of everything. Not to mention some of the reality distorting things that made it even more confusing. However, it wasn\u2019t a detriment to my enjoyment of this film. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a hilarious movie that takes familiar elements and manages to make something wholly original.",

It's really great and you should see it for yourself: Really, go watch this movie. I loved the fact that you could take every shot, pause it and put it in a comic book.

We just have to find that inner belief that fits. \"It always fits.... eventually\" It doesn\u00b4t matter who is wearing the mask. Spider-Man isn\u00b4t Peter or Miles, but they are Spider-Man. The movie is also about learning to trust yourself. There\u00b4s an impactful scene where Miles sees his father saying \"Come on Spider-Man, get up!\" or in other words, he sees that his father is believing in Spiderman, even though he didn\u00b4t use to believe in Spider-Man. On that moment the spark inside Miles became a bright fire of hope. He truly became Spider-Man. I could talk endlessly about how great ths movie is visually. The soundtrack is also extremely underrated. \"Destiny\" \"The Prowler\" and \"Only One Spider Man\" are the ones that for me stand out the most.

Now hearing this you may assume that I'd love anything with Spider-Man... and... I mean... you're not wrong. I don't think I could ever outright 'hate' anything Spider-Man related. But at the same time, no other Spider-Man movie has had me writing reviews on Amazon, Fandango, IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes singing its praises.\n\nInto the Spider-Verse is (to me)- without a doubt- the best Spider-Man movie yet. And to be fair, if there was ever a movie I was skeptical about, it was this one. Sony Animation-- the same people who did The Emoji Movie and the Smurfs films-- making the first Marvel animated movie (Not counting Big Hero 6)?? Was't looking too good... But DANG did they knock it out of the park! Not only are the visuals outstanding-- using 3D animation in an almost unprecedented way where it seriously looks like it is a living comic book-- but the cast, soundtrack, and story are all phenomenal. For anyone who reads the comics, there's plenty of Spider-Man fan service. For anyone who doesn't, there's plenty here to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout. It's got its moments of being down-to-earth, it's got humor, it's got heart. It's definitely a super hero film, but it's also a coming-of-age film.\n\nIf you even remotely enjoy Spider-Man, do yourself a favor and check this out!",

            "content": "Genius move by Sony to introduce Miles Morales this way (with help of \"original\" Spidey), because even hardcore Spider-Man \"purists\" will have to give it chance given the cool and adventurous plot of this animated film. The Spider verse stands extremely well on its own here, even though it's not set in the MCU (back to Spider-Man is only Superhero that exists). As soon as you start watching this film you see, hear, and feel the very different vibe this has from other Spider-Man films (live action or animated). The 3D CGI art is it's own style and the soundtrack is a mix of old school and new school hip hop, melodic beats, and even Spiderman style movie orchestra. \n\nThis movie definetly had Spidey fans in mind as there are many references, eater eggs, and homages to past films. It's kept in mind that the audience is most likely a Spider-Man veteran by now. I like the choices for the \"Spider Men\" because they all bring their own unique traits to the table. Fans will have fun debating what Peter Parker they are reminded the most of here (Tobey or Andrew) because this \"jaded\" take on Spider-Man is really funny. Noir Spider-Man was surprisingly entertaining with Nicolas Cage voicing him. Spider Gwen was pretty much the most cool headed person of the bunch.  \n\nAnother amazing thing this animated film does is story and character development. Morales' journey into becoming full-fledged Spider-Man builds up so well and the chemistry between the Morales family is amazing. The father-son (and also uncle-nephew) relationship is something we've rarely seen in Spidey films (for obvious reasons) and certain scenes do hit you in the \"feels\" multiple times. \n\nIn the end Spider-Man into the Spider Verse isn't just another animated film, it's an experience. Made for the fans and for kids to enjoy as well (be ready for many questions as they might get lost, a lot here is comic book info). Get ready to have fun and get lost (in a good way) for a couple of hours. FINAL REVIEW: 9.5 out of 10. My favorite Spider-Man film next to Spider-Man 2 (Tobey).",

I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)d have to first start off with the brilliant animation. I was absolutley astounded and couldn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t get over just how incredible it looked. The color pallet and choices looked amazing and nothing ever looked for felt dull unless it was intentional. Even the black and white parts were dynamic and never felt bland. The movement of just about everything was so fluid and smooth. The attention to detail in every moment astounded me. Next I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)d have to talk about the music. God the music choices never felt off and the soundtrack was brilliant. The songs were perfect for the mood and the score was phenomenal. Nothing ever felt out of place and the music only heightened the emotions of each scene. The voice acting was also very well choosen, no one felt out of place and like they didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t match their character. Its was perfect honestly. And then there\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s the story. My #1 concern when seeing the brilliant animation was if the story was going to suffer, because it happens a lot that a movie has great animation but ends up being lackluster because if the story but I you can rest assured that Sony delivered in that area too. The story was very entertaing and set up for a lot of famtastic moments in the movie. I can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t really think of any real flaws with it with it either. The script ws incredibly well written and the humor left the theater I was in cackling. The movie honestly hit all the marks of a great family movie. The humor was there, the heart was there (you could defintely tell a lot of live sweat and tears went into this movie), the spirit, the writing, the animation, the music, it was all there. If I could describe this movie with one word it would be refreshing. It was so well done and especally after getting lack luster movies this holiday season and the dark turns movies have been taking lately. I almost forgot the representation!! God was it so well done, seeing that afro-latinx culture made me so happy. The fact that they spoke Spanglish at home made me so happy!! You could see how it influences his character too and wasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t just the team trying to get brownie points for including it. It was apart of Miles and I really love that. This movie is definitely one of my favorite and I really can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t explain how it made me feel all kinds of emotions. I cried, I laughed, I was angery, I was happy, I felt proud, I felt fear I felt everything. My heart was with the movie and it very hard for movies to do that to me. I just really adore this movie I want as many people to see it because its just that good. Before watching it I remember people saying it was the \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2best movie of the year\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? and I was skeptical but after seeing it I understood. I completely understood and it might as well be. I love this movie so much and hope it can set the standard for animated movies in the future.",

Miles Morales as the new spider-man is wel established, acted, executed, and has a genuinely great character arc. He's not strong or a Garry Sue when he gets his powers, he's weak and eventually grows as the movie progresses. He's flawed and eventually resolves those flaws, that's rare in most movies today with as many progressive themes there are. \n\nThe art style and animation is absolutely beautiful and appealing to watch. As soon as Raimi's films were referenced and used, you are going to be kicked in the heart, it's really amazing and very well executed and self aware movie. Everything about this movie is well executed: the comedy is funny with every scene, the emotional moments are powerful and they don't hold any punches. Literally also, there's some mild language and on screen blood, good for you movie. \n\nThis film is amazing. It had a better message for everyone than Black Panther could ever accomplish. This is by far, the best superhero movie of this year (maybe next to Infinity War). \n\n(Also, attention to all snowflakes, if you want a progressive film to win something, this is the one!)",

It has heart, character, action, suspense, drama, and a genuine sense of wonder and awe. Scenes in this film, especially the \"leap of faith\" will be considered iconic 20 years from now. The animation style is breathtaking and jumps out at the viewer. This is the best animated film of the year, the best superhero film of the year, and possibly one of the greatest superhero films of all time.

I do not care for the Iron Man movies, Captain America is just shmeh IMO and I honestly did not get all the hullalaboo over Black Panther. Sure they are entertaining enough for a Saturday afternoon watch on Netflix (i.e.) but not movies I am willing to fork over theater amounts of money to watch.\n\nBut Sunday afternoon changed that line of thinking for me. I brought my grandson to see Spiderman Into the Spiderverse.\n\nI LOVED IT!! The movie itself is damn near flawless. The animation is amazing, at times a glorious assault on the senses. Now, I am normally not one who wants my senses to be assaulted - but what they did with this movie was quite frankly, at times, mind boggling. So while it was a visual assault of colors, fast moving graphics, etc I was still able to sit back and not only enjoy the fun of it all but also appreciate the talent and endless hours of work that no doubt was required.\n\nThe voicing actors were great. With a few whose voices I was not expecting\n\nI literally laughed out loud throughout this movie, as did everyone else in the theater. Most of the humor my 8 year old grandson was able to appreciate. A couple of moments though I am sure were a bit lost on him. Not that those moments were \"blue\" in nature, but rather you would need to be over a certain age to understand some of the pop culture references. It was such fun watching him have such a fun time watching this movie. Basically I got a two for one special - watched a great movie and reveled in watching my grand-son enjoy it just as much as I was.\n\nThe story line is twisty enough to keep it interesting yet simple enough to keep it from becoming convoluted. I mean lets be honest here - my grand-son was probably having an easier time understanding the whole multi dimension universes than I was.\n\nIf you are Marvel fan and/or a Spiderman fan then of course you must see this movie. \n\nBUT if you are like me and would normally just wait to watch a superhero movie on Netflix (i.e.) if you even watch them at all then take two steps back, go online and buy a couple of tickets to see this movie in the theater. You NEED to see this one in the theater! Take your kids, your grand-kids, nieces, nephews HELL take your mom and dad! It is just that awesome of a movie, anyone and I mean ANYONE should be able to find the fun in this movie and enjoy the almost 2 hour ride (and those 2 hours fly by!!)",

He's not simply the \"black Spider-Man\" or \"biracial Spider-Man;\" MIles Morales helped bring new comics readers into the world. As the language of superhero movies becomes more and more complex, even the seemingly simplest stories require a level of comprehension that would have seemed unattainable two decades ago. Nowadays, kids are much more quick to pick up on story structure and character and themes involving alternate realities. With that in mind, we can have stories like these, with creators unafraid to challenge audiences, knowing that these high-minded concepts can be absorbed by today's audiences.",

And while each of those incarnations have their own unique qualities that make each effort commendable (even the less successful ones-I'm a fan of the Marc Webb Amazing films, even), with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse we get something that would seemingly be the nail in the coffin as far as originality in blockbuster cinema goes. I mean, \"Seven Spider-Man films in sixteen years? That's a new Spider-Man every four years and didn't we just get a new Peter Parker last summer? Why do we need another Spider-Man let alone another Spider-Man movie?\" These are all valid questions and concerns, but somehow-rather than being the tipping point that sends audiences over the edge into full-on superhero saturation directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman have crafted a superhero film that does the complete opposite and reinvigorates the genre over and over again with its brisk two-hour time frame. What Spider-Verse does to separate itself from the past incarnations of the character is not only introduce a new Spider-Man in the form of Miles Morales (DOPE's Shameik Moore), but to also offer a completely new origin story that also offers a new perspective on what it's like to be a superhero. The movie, which comes from producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The LEGO Movie, 21 and 22 Jump Street) with Lord getting a sole screenwriting credit, knows exactly what it is and if you've seen any of Lord and Miller's previous work then you know how aware and how smart they are about recognizing the genre they're operating within, completely lampooning that genre, and then creating an experience of a movie that exists within that genre that is somehow simultaneously one of the best examples of that genre. For instance, if you were to pool this year's list of superhero films (a very strong year to boot) Spider-Verse would still be among the very best of them despite the fact superhero fatigue and references to past missteps in the series are explicit within the film's DNA. By executing the tropes audiences have become accustomed to in such expert fashion and placing this fresh twist on our expectations of the genre, Spider-Verse is able to stake claim in the fact that while viewers have seen plenty of superhero movies before, they've never seen one quite like this.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

It's a movie made by the people behind the Lego Movie and it shows, the emotional scenes are given the time to hit their chords, the cameos and Easter eggs are all there. The story of Miles Morales is brought to the big screen in full, not pulling many punches. However, the movie is bogged down by a lot of references that would be lost on another crowd. Which makes one wonder whether or not this team could've cracked the code to timeless if they weren't held back by this concept that demands modern day, in franchise references to be successful. It's an excellent movie, with Oscar-worthy animation and style all it's own, but it's only a \"good\" entry point for newcomers to this franchise. I want to give this movie five stars, but to me that five star rating is reserved for those timeless works of art, and this just BARELY, misses that margin.",

We are soon introduced to several different Spider people including a second Peter Parker, a Gwen Stacy Spiderwoman and a Spider Pig (I kid you not). They must team up and take down Kingpin to return to their respective dimensions while helping Miles realise his powers. The animation is awesome at times and at others a bit distracting. The Miles character is very likeable and having the movie about him is refreshing given all the Peter Parker reboots. There are throwbacks to the Sony Spider Man films and a great Stan Lee cameo. I had high expectations given some high praise in reviews and its Rotten Tomatoes score, so it couldn't live up to them. It's not perfect, possibly a bit too long but very enjoyable and amusing.

            "content": "Across the comic book industry, the idea of a multiverse has diminished the canon boundary for unlimited creativity in different stories while using versions of the same character. Marvel's flagship character and company mascot Spider-Man broke grounds as an independent young heroic student in both lives, which labels him as a wild card of storytelling possibilities in multiple ranges of what he is unlike the other heroes are pretty much straight forward with not much to creatively twist in different ways. Even though Doctor Strange unveils the dimensional multiverses, Spider-Man embodies the concept the most - under Marvel's brand - and the narrative acceptance that expands the lore is brought together in \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\".\n\nThe basis of a Spider-Man story sees Brooklyn teen Miles Morales, in his cinematic introduction, as a new student taking on challenges and the complex of his familial relationships. Things get more coincidently weird when he receives a fateful spider bite that gave him a little more uncontrollable possibilities than a spider can. But after a traumatizing moment he'd witnessed as the start of something bigger, he rises to be responsible of his given power, with the unexpected help of the Spider-Verse where more than one can wears the mask.\n\nSpider-Man is currently in his second reboot with the MCU, among couple of other iterations in this century, and Sony continues in offering a contributive narrative bonus for the young hero with the expansive multiverse at a beneficial bargaining rate. The focus of the film's storytelling is to not only demonstrate a unique case of a multiverse becoming explanatory; it's to introduce a new range of characters while focusing on a different Spider-Man than Peter Parker. The refreshing experience really rehashed the lore's keywords \"amazing\" and \"spectacular\" to celebrate the hero's defining legacy, namely what makes a hero and what is Spider-Man. (In other words, the story basically de-aged the original second chapter's complications). The diverse characterization is the sole factor that runs the film as Marvel's probably most creative heroic deed, while also genuinely bold.\n\nWith the diverse characterization courtesy of the Spider-Verse, the heartfelt, fun originality of the narrative structure and astounding animation - as a flashy groundbreaking visual style from replicating the drawn surface of comics, and enabling fast-paced action under such momentum - are run by the exceptional casting in not just producing charm but also dimensionally breaking out (pun not intended) the newly introduced characters. While they build up the heart through the aforementioned attempt of heroic definition, they provoked emotional resonance in few scenes while most of the time for fun stirring up the humor.\n\n\"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" swings to the top next to \"Homecoming\" under relations to the rest of the web-slinger's film franchise, while the qualities overall makes this the best creativity that was ever expressed and presented/demonstrated under Marvel, including their okay animation branch. When ranked among the yearly released, it's certainly one of the very few to be considered the year's best animated feature by heart and creativity - effectively similar in akin to \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\" - as well definitely ranking among the year's top ten. You could say the film possesses great power, and is greatly responsible towards such. (A+)",

            "content": "Walking out of Brad Bird's hotly anticipated sequel to The Incredibles, I was convinced there wouldn't be a better-animated film for the rest of the calendar year. Then I saw Ralph Wrecks the Internet and felt the same conclusion. What could top these two incredible movies from Disney? I wasn't expecting a parallel world Spider-Man animated film to contend with that heralded echelon, but after watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, I am now certain. This is the best-animated film of the year and one of the best films of the year, full stop. It's rich, imaginative, exciting, satisfying, and way too much fun.\n\nMiles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is an ordinary teenager starting a new school he's eager to leave. His police officer father, Jefferson Davis (voiced by Brian Tyree Henry), is pushing him and can be embarrassing. His cooler uncle Aaron (voiced by Mahershala Ali) encourages Miles to express himself through his graffiti art. One night, Miles encounters the famous Spider-Man, a particle collider, and a special spider from another dimension that bites him. He develops super powers and seeks out Peter Parker (voiced by Jake Johnson) as the only other person who might understand what he's experiencing. Except there happens to be multiple Spider-laden heroes, including Spider Gwen, a.k.a. Gwen Stacy (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Pig (voiced by John Mulaney), Spider-Man Noir (voiced by Nicolas Cage), and an anime heroine Peni Parker with a giant spider robot friend. They're all from alternate dimensions, dragged into Miles' world thanks to Kingpin's (voiced by Liev Schreiber) particle collider. If they don't get back to their original worlds they'll glitch out of existence, and Miles' own world, and everyone inside it, is threatened by the instability of that collider.\n\nInto the Spider-Verse is bursting with color, imagination, kinetic energy, and a real celebration of the art form of animation and comics. Once that super spider bites Miles, the visual mechanics of the movie alter as well as him. Suddenly his thoughts are louder and appear in floating boxes (only we can see), in addition to thought bubbles, sound effects, and the occasional panel shifting transition device. It gets far closer than Ang Lee's Hulk at recreating the experience of a living comic, and it's joyous. The animation style too recreates the cross-shading effect of comic artists and the fluidity of the animation has purposely removed frames, giving it a slight stutter-step more often found in stop-motion animation. This distinct style might be off-putting to certain audience members accustomed to the smooth movements of modern animation mimicking real life, but for comic fans, it better approaches the captured stills of comic panels being connected into a whole. The different animation styles of the new Spider characters, Looney Tunes to anime to stark noir Frank Miller riffs, become reminders of separate universes with their own visual rules that keep things fun. The film is vibrantly colorful and gorgeous to watch on the big screen where a person can best luxuriate in that flamboyant palette. The finale feels like an explosion of splash pages and graphic designs merging together, even mimicking the sprawling graffiti art of Miles. It's a spectacular visual feast that manages to be that rare treat of something new yet familiar.\n\nThe action of Into the Spider-Verse is delightful when it's comedic and thrilling when it's serious, but at every turn its fun, well developed, and wonderfully rendered. Early on, as Miles learns the tricks of his new and confusing abilities, the action is wildly funny. Take for instance a sequence where he becomes attached to an unconscious Peter Parker through the Spider-Man webbing. Soon after, the police approach Miles, and now he has to make a break for it while still attached to another body, forcing him into a series of comic escapes. It's highly spirited and filled with enjoyable jokes. Later, as Miles gets more centrally involved in Kingpin's scheme, the action becomes harsher, more violent, and dangerous. A battle between Miles and The Prowler gets more and more extreme, especially after some twists an audience may or may not see coming depending upon their source material knowledge (this is a parallel universe, after all). The action is frenetic, inventive, and visually engaging, easy to follow and filled with wonderful organic complications that allow each scene to feel vital and different from the last.\n\nInto the Spider-Verse is also brashly hilarious from beginning to end. Being co-written by the writers responsible for The Lego Movie and 22 Jump Street, I was expecting a combination of clever and antic, and that's what they delivered and then some. There are brilliantly conceived and executed jokes but, and this is what separates the professionals, they do not distract from the larger work of the characterization. Often the humor is built through the characters, their personality and motivation differences, and the unique circumstances, so even when its zany it feels connected or grounded. There's a silly joke about getting more bread from a waiter that works on multiple levels and they keep going back to it for further meaning, and it's one example of many that shows the work put into their funny is meaningful and smart. After six movies and several animated series, audiences are well versed in the origin of Spider-Man, so Into the Spider-Verse even turns that knowledge into a source of humor itself, laying a formula for each new Spider character to introduce themselves with the same fill-in-the-blanks origin speech. The alternate universe Spider heroes do not overstay their welcome and, miraculously, even find themselves with some potent small character moments, which is an amazing feat given the 100-minute running time. The laboratory break-in with Peter Parker and Miles is a comic highlight with plenty of complications, and there's a smart, sly joke about personal biases that just slides by nonchalantly that had me howling. The post-credit scene had me laughing so hard that I was crying. Please, I implore you, stick around for it and go out laughing with the biggest smile on your face.\n\nBesides being a great comic book movie and a great action movie, Into the Spider-Verse is also just a great movie. The Spider-Man character is so familiar that the film easily could have gone on autopilot yet it puts in the work to build characters we care about, give them arcs, and provide setups and payoffs both big and small to maximize audience satisfaction. Miles is a terrific new character with a voice all his own, and his teenage foibles are both recognizable and refreshing. He's a hero worth rooting for, and his more personal family issues can be just as compelling as the end-of-the-world adventures. That's the core of what makes Spider-Man still an invigorating character 50 years later, and Into the Spider-Verse taps into that essential element even with an alternate universe Spider hero. It's got the DNA of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original creation and given a welcomed jolt of relevancy thanks to the onscreen racial diversity and youthful perspective.\n\nThere are two relationships at the core: Miles and his father and Miles and Peter Parker. The latter is an unexpected mentor/pupil relationship that provides the enjoyment of watching both members grow through their bond, and the former allows a familial baseline to come back to and demonstrate how far we've come. The Peter Parker/Miles relationship has that big brother/little brother angst that keeps things sharp while still maintaining an undercurrent of emotional need. There were genuine moments where my eyes welled up. The film can be that affecting because it is so well structured and developed from a characterization standpoint. Even the chief villain, the Kingpin, has a motivation that is personal and effectively empathetic. Everyone involved gets careful consideration, even the bad guys.\n\nLet me cite one prime example that showcases how great the storytelling can be (minor spoilers). At one point, Miles is bound and gagged by the other heroes to prevent him from joining them in a dangerous activity they do not believe he is ready for. They're removing him from the team for his own good. Then, at this low point, his father comes to visit him and tries talking to him through the other side of his dormitory door. They've had some challenging moments between them and what Mr. Davis has to say is extra challenging. He's trying to connect with a son he feels he's losing touch with, and it's a one-sided conversation where Miles is unable to respond to his father's pleas, who eventually walks away knowing his son is there but not ready to talk. Right there, the screenwriters have gone from the fantastic to the personal, finding a way to bring Miles even lower but in an organic fashion that plays right into his ongoing communication problems. It's a simple moment to start with, standard even, but then having it contribute to the father/son estrangement is beautiful and handled so well. The sparkling screenplay for Into the Spider-Verse is packed with moments like this.\n\nThe voice acting is perfectly suited for their roles. Moore (The Get Down) is an expressive and capable young actor that brings a terrific vulnerability to Miles, selling every emotion with authenticity. Johnson (Tag) is the absolute best choice for a slacker Spider-Man who has become jaded and self-indulgent. His laid back rhythms gel nicely with Moore's eager breathlessness. Henry (Widows) is so paternal it hurts your heart. Steinfeld (Bumblebee) is poised and enjoyably spry. Cage (Mandy) is doing everything you'd want a Nicolas Cage-voiced crime fighter to be. Schreiber (Ray Donovan) can be threatening in his sleep with that velvety voice of his. Plus you get Katheryn Hahn as a villain, Zoe Kravitz as Mary Jane, and Lily Tomlin as Aunt May, and they're all great.\n\nAs the credits rolled for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, I tried searching my brain for any flaws, minor quibbles, anything that would hold the film back from an entertainment standpoint. The only thing I could think of is that animation style, but different people will either find that look appealing or irritating. This is a glorious and gloriously entertaining movie replete with humor, heart, surprises, payoffs, and a great creative energy that bursts from the big screen. This really is a movie to see on the big screen as well, to better feast on the eye-popping visuals and pop-art comic book aesthetics that leap from the page to the screen. It's the second best Spidey movie, after 2017's impeccably structured solo venture, Homecoming. The late addition of the other alternate universe Spider heroes keeps things silly even as it raises the stakes. The film is a wonderful blending of tones and styles, from the different characters and universes to the heartfelt emotions and vicarious thrills of being young and super powered. This is a movie that even Spider novices can climb aboard and fall in love with. Into the Spider-Verse is a film for fans of all ages and nothing short of the bets animated film of 2018. It's as good as advertised, folks.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

After endless reboots of the Spider-Man franchise, I'd tired of the character on the screen, but this film brings a fresh perspective, some spectacular animation, and real emotion to the superhero.\n\nAlternate universes collide, bringing several different versions of Spider-Man (or -Woman, or, um, -Pig) together. What results is an interesting exploration of the responsibility, sacrifice, and ordeals of being a superhero. Of course, there are also evildoers to combat and plenty of action, artfully rendered with impressive and kinetic animation. The movie is an explosion of motion, color, and animation styles that gives the story a dynamic kick. (I saw the film in 2D but may return to the theater to see it in 3D, given the kind of depth and action on the screen.)\n\nThe plot introduces us to Miles Morales, a young man struggling to fit into his upscale prep school, find common ground with his police officer father, and (of course) figure out what's happening to him since he was bitten by a neon spider while tagging a subway wall. About the only gripe I'd have with this movie is that a bit less of the setup with young Morales might've made more room for all the colorful (and black-and-white) Spider-Man characters that Miles soon meets.\n\nThe alternate universe Spider-Beings are a weird and wonderful grab bag of characters brought to life with a terrific voice cast, including Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, John Mulaney, Nicolas Cage, and Kimiko Glenn (with Mahershala Ali, Lily Tomlin, and Liev Schreiber in supporting roles.)\n\nA winning mix of story, emotion, action, and humor make Spider-Man a superhero film worth seeing, and the artistry of the animation make it a movie worth seeing on the big screen. \n\nGrade: A-",

This movie didn't try hard, it didn't try and get its hands dirty, it was just a movie that used timing perfectly instead of overdoing things to try and make it good. Honestly?

Not only is it already my favorite best comic book movie but it may even be one of the best animated films I've ever seen, rivaling Pixar's best. The animation pops and brings comic book pages to life right down to the 'Kirby Krackle'. Animators have attempted this unique blend of 2D and 3D animation styles that just work wonders in translating the comic book feel to motion unlike anything before. A very visionary alternative to the 3D Pixar style that has become the industry standard since Toy Story back in 1995. It's even psychedelic in parts. They've done some clever use of dialogue boxes, thought bubbles and transitions that are unique to comic books. Every single frame is brimming with Spiderman references ranging from iconic to those obscure deep comic book lore. The screenplay is crisp and sharp too. I'd totally be okay if the current live action superhero boom ends with Avengers 4 next year (just because I'm already committed) and shifts to this format going forward. #IntotheSpiderverse is an innovative, kinetic and endearing masterpiece.

            "content": "When it comes to adapting the character of Spider-Man, most of his filmed works are done via live action, and rarely has there been an animated movie been centered around the character. That is until now. \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? is an animated feature that centers around the large multiverse that the character is involved with. While there could be more focus and attention on some important characters, the film looks and sounds great enough to ignore these minor details. \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? is a great leap into the ever expanding world of the comic book character, and then some.\n\nThe story has Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) accidentally getting bit by a radioactive spider, and obtaining the same powers as Spider-Man. However, due to a machine that can create alternate realities headed by the Kingpin (Liev Schreiber), a series of other spider people come through. These include another Peter Parker (Jake Johnson), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Noir (Nicholas Cage), Peni  Parker (Kimiko Glenn), and Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), a talking pig. Now, Miles must learn to not only control his newfound abilities, but also bring these guys back to their respective dimensions without causing harm to anyone.\n\n\u00ef\u00bf 1/2Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? is an interesting take the web crawler has had. Unlike previous iterations, this tale is more down to earth with its execution, and treating the main character of Miles Morales as a teenager instead of being portrayed as an adult acting like a teenager. Miles just might be the mots relatable Spider-Man to date; he's a teenager that's going through rough times, and has to tackle on this big responsibility of being Spider-Man.\n\nThat's the big appeal to this movie: the story. While it does contain a plot, the viewer will be wowed by everything that is happening on screen. And for comic book fans, they will more than enjoy all of the references and easter eggs that the film has to offer. Plus, there is a neat little scene after the credits that expands on the big multiverse that Spider-Man is involved with.\n\nThe real selling point is with the animation. Sony Pictures Animation worked close with Marvel to bring this world to life, and it definitely payed off for them. This entire world that has been created looks and feels like a comic book coming to life. Every single detail from the backgrounds to the character designs is incredible. Every person working on this movie deserves a big pat on the back for putting all of this attention to detail here.\n\nThe music has a nice hip hop blend to it, along with some electronic moments, but the soundtrack could have been given some orchestration to make it stand out. \n\nThe characters, while good and have great direction from their respective actors, really do not give a lot of attention and focus unlike Miles or Peter. This movie definitely offers a lot of characters, but rather than just being there, give them a purpose outside of just bring fan service.\n\nAlso, the movie does go on a little too long. However, the film does keep your interest, and there's no chance of getting bored. But it does take a while to finally get to the ultimate conclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u00ef\u00bf 1/2? is a well thought out animated movie that brings out the character of Spider-Man that audiences have never seen before. And opens up a whole new world of possibilities.",

Come on, they somehow decided to make the Emoji Movie! And now they have squished those together. Also, I would have thought that bringing the multiverse, a very complicated and huge part of comics, to the big screen. They executed it brilliantly. Stan Lee has an actual big part of the film. He inspires Miles to buy the Spider-Man costume and says it will fit anyone. Which is an enormous nod to how Stan Lee likes his superheroes to be any diversity, sexuality, beliefs. He believed that anybody could be a hero. And I liked the memorial of not only Stan Lee but Steve Ditko as well in the credits. By the way, there is an end credit scene which left me so excited for the sequel. The animation was incredible. They used many styles of animation anime, looney tunes, noir. But the main animation they used was a comic book style animation. It was like watching a moving comic book.\n\nEverything that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller produce is gold. They both produced the two Cloudy with a Chance Of Meatballs movies and recently The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part. I would've preferred characters from the comics that appeared in the series like Superior Spider-Man or UK Spider-Man. But learning about these characters from the movies and in my own time, they are way more interesting. A radioactive pig who bit a spider to a girl with a telepathic connection to a spider. They had the basic characters they needed for the story like Spider-Gwen and Miles Morales. Miles and Gwen were played by Shamik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld. They had great scenes together. I fought it was brave killing off Peter. Well from Miles universe anyway. I really felt something. And they barely gave us anything about him. Everyone else's reaction I guess made the moment sympathetic. Kingpin was the main villain. Liev Schreiber isn't a brut sounding person, well in this case anyway. That's what made Kingpins like Vincent D'onofrio fantastic. And I don't recall Kingpins head being in between his nipples. But they did get his strength and size right.\n\nI crapped myself when those jumpscares came. There weren't many. The flow of the film felt really passive and came making it super unexpected. Mahershala Ali is a fantastic actor. He was great and I am glad he played Miles Uncle also known as from the comics, the Prowler. I thought Spider-Ham was going to be over the top because he was quite silly in the trailer as well as Peni Parker. But he didn't go as over the top as I thought. I loved how they incorporated the Spidey gadgets. The soundtrack is more than incredible as well as the comedy. I feel like this film was very underrated. Watch this film now! And if this doesn't win an Oscar for best animation, I'm gonna be pissed!",

The style of animation definitely bypasses current days outlines and is quite relatable, but I can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)t help but always long for the 1990s spider-man shapes that are simply animated depictions of real life.\n\nAll in all, into the spiderverse is well established, well crafted movie that no doubt gives Morales a just introduction to the big screen and gives the spider-man universe a decent gateway to our universe.

Two specific sequences stand out -- one in which Miles' father speaks to him from beyond a closed door; and the second when Miles' powers fully emerge -- and they're the two best scenes in the Spider-Man film canon and perhaps of any film of 2019.

Parker who's more of a slouch and jaded after having bad experiences as Spidey, a version of Gwen Stacy aka Spider-Gwen who lost her best friend, a black-and-white version called Spider-Man Noir from the 1930's, Peni Parker who's DNA bonds with a robotic spider, and an animal version called Spider-Ham who's more of the goofy, Howard-the-Duck esque jokester\nthe movie has a lot of charm to it by making so many callbacks to previous media forms of Spider-Man from his comic debut in 1962 to a Christmas album to the Sam Raimi movies to his Aunt May to Mary Jane Watson to Donald Glover to a Spider-lair full of vehicles and various suits but also making a few new changes like a female version of Dock Ock\nfantastic voice acting from Hailee Steinfeld to Liev Schrieber to Nicholas Cage, stunning animation making the whole thing feel like an actual comic book moving from page-to-page, a sufficient amount of heart, exciting action, one hell of a twist in the middle, and a ton of humor\nit's also got a killer soundtrack \nMIles still has a lot of learn in order to be his best version of himself not copy others, his family doesn't run away from things, the hardest part of the job is knowing you can't save everyone, and figuring out who he wants to be may just be the key to rising to the occasion \nit's also kinda nice to see Stan Lee in one of his last cameos \nthe movie has some great messages for everyone not just Spider-Man/comic fans to pick up on; each of us in a way has a power of our own to help the world, anyone can be a superhero in their own way, all it takes is a leap of faith to succeed as well\na few side villains could have been cut and it was disappointing most of the footage from the trailers didnt make the final cut\nstill, SONY and Marvel seem to be on a the right track and I'm very happy they're still moving forward making more side stories and spinoffs :)",

            "content": "I have a new favorite Spider-Man film!\n\nInto the Spider-Verse looks amazing. I've seen combinations of two- and three-dimensional animation before, but not anything like this. The movie is very colorful and makes excellent use of action. The whole thing is supposed to look like a comic book and has some wildly creative ideas, including color slightly popping off the lines and thought captions and bubbles. This movie takes place in an alternate reality from more traditional Spider-Man timelines, giving the creators liberty to come up with some inventive visual twists on classic Spider-Man villains without feeling like real betrayals to the characters.\n\nNow, the movie does have a couple things that I adjusted to but may bug people with more sensitive eyes. As mentioned, the color is off-line and the background in particular can be blurry-looking. The motion frame rate is a little jerky, which I assume is a stylistic choice.\n\nThe plot is equally impressive. The film features Spider-Men from multiple dimensions and multiple other characters yet manages balance and develop them all almost seamlessly. (Wouldn't have minded a little more time on Mile's relationship with his uncle, but that's a minor issue.) The comedy and drama is equally good. The movie has fun, but there are also stakes. There is real loss in this. (Parents who are more selective in what their children watch, may consider this more of a \"big boy\" film).\n\nThe movie stars Spider-Man Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), who started off in Marvel's Ultimate comic line. He became popular enough that when the Ultimate universe was shut down, because Ultimate Spider-Man was the only real big seller, he was transferred to the main Marvel line. Hardcore Peter Parker fans may be upset that he isn't the star, but they did such a great job with Miles' character that I don't think you'll mind. He is likable and has personal issues like Peter, but in his own unique way. He forms a mentor relationship with a down-on-his-luck and world-weary Peter Parker (New GIrl's Jake Johnson), and the two of them have great chemistry and basically make the movie.\n\nThis is one of those truly innovative steps in moviemaking and a sincere homage to comic books.",

It's not only my favorite Spider-Man incarnation - it's my favorite animated movie of the year, it's probably my favorite superhero movie of the year, and it might just be my favorite movie of the year.

Basically look at the Wolverine movies for \"serious/grimdark\" and the Adam West Batman show for the complete opposite end of the spectrum.\nSpider-Verse plonks itself down in a nice, comfortable median spot between the two and just works it for all it's worth.\n\nThe art style is great for the chosen medium.  VERY immersive, though a few scenes you can tell were prepped for 3D conversion (I see stuff in standard 2D because 3D causes me eye strain and headaches).  But, overall, it worked just fine.\n\nThe voice acting in here was so transparent and just fit.  So much so that praising it would require me to point out areas of inconsistency where there really weren't any.\n\nAll in all, a marvelously put-together film.\n\nI'll be going to actually see it again.\n\nThis goes to show that, when Sony doesn't interfere too much, it CAN do these movies justice.",

I usually don't watch animation unless it is DC related Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc. Just prefer live action. And I would not of seen this if it wasn't for the rave reviews. But it really good and one of the rare animated films I will add to my movie digital library. As much as I liked it the first time I think I am going to appreciate it more with repeated viewings.

Miles Morales is important for who he is as a movie lead. The animation is sharp and works particularly well in 3D, reminding me of the best of The Incredibles.  The art here pops, and in the last act there are some particularly notable \u00e2hero\u00e2? shots. The voice cast work is strong with Shameik Moore giving us a very sympathetic Miles Morales. Jake Johnson is terrific as a more dad-bod leaning alternate Peter B Parker. Liev Shreiber as Kingpin, Brian Tyree Henry as Miles\u00e2(TM) dad Jefferson, and even Nicholas Cage as Spider-man Noir bring a lot to this interpretation. I gotta admit the anime and Warner-Bros cartoon \u00e2~verse jolted me out of plot for a minute, but eventually even they get smoothed back into the mix.  Screenplay author Phil Lord as well as the trio of directors show a love and respect for the source materials. There is the MCU-esque load of humor we have come to expect. Spidey Mile\u00e2(TM)s and Kingpin\u00e2(TM)s ultimate slugfest may not have been all that enlightening or satisfying. If nothing else, it feels good to see the first Stan Lee cameo (of sorts) since his passing.",

The escape from the Hudson lab was very well done and had me in stitches for most of it.\nSO SO:\n- Visual style was unique, but distracting.  The ending especially was too much flashy bright lights.  If I was a teenager that read a bunch of comic books, I would be thrilled.  As an adult it just looked off.\n- spider-reboot - how many reboots of Spider Man do we really need?\n- the movie was entertaining to watch, but felt like it went on too long - especially the ending battle scene.\nCONS:\n- too much going on at once.  I counted no fewer than 7 spider people, and an array of baddies - whenever there are an array of baddies, that means no baddie is good enough to stand on their own, and that felt true here.  And 'Here is my story...' gets old after a couple of tellings.\n- And the theme of 'Anyone could be spider man' seems to me contradictory to the Spider Man (original) world.  What did most people who got power do in the Spider Man world?  Become a baddie.  Here, anyone can get bitten and become Spider Man including Spider Man's girlfriend, an Anime character and a pig.  Not that that isn't funny, but at some point it just gets ridiculous. \n- Of course there is the 'Luke I am your Father' scene with the uncle, but what could have been a major antagonist plot theme became a short 5 minute throwaway scene (in fairness, the Uncle Ben death scene wasn't long either, but there was no big reveal there)\n- the new Spider Man has to have black street cred or something.  From being a tagger to wearing untied sneakers, he must certainly resonate with the youth... or something.  At least they had the decency to make Morales upright and not morally conflicted, but it just seemed like pandering.  Although who knows?  Maybe when Lee wrote Spider Man back in the 60s, he was catering to nerds?  But now that he is NOT a nerd, I guess Aunt May has to act as Q?\n- Look, if you are going to create a new character, do it.  Spider girl, or spider pig, or black spider or whatever.  To go through the motions of killing off spider man and then taking his place - it felt forced and distasteful.",

The animation is themed to look like a comic book with thought bubbles, sound effects, and other things like that showing up in the movie. That style pays off enormously for the film as a whole. The pace of this movie is so fast that it reminds me of an Edgar Wright film which is never a bad thing. The soundtrack is also unbelievably spectacular and makes the film even easier to watch than it already was. This might be my favorite Spider-man movie which is really saying something because I absolutely adore Homecoming.

I absolutely love Spider-Man. He is my favorite character of all time so I was super excited for this. I loved Into the Spider-Verse! Everything was definitely thought through very carefully, taking into consideration all the comics and backstories for each character. The story was amazing. It was trippy and just fantastic. It wasn\u2019t really predictable for the most part which is really good. The voice acting was really good. Shameik Moore as Miles was by far the best part. His emotion was really good and you could feel for him like you knew Miles. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker was really good. I thought that Spider-Man was funny and just enjoyable. Mahershala Ali as Uncle Aaron was very good. Mahershala is just a really good actor and if was cool to hear him voice acting. Brian Tyree Henry player Jefferson Davis and he was a great voice actor for Miles\u2019s father. All the characters had great development. There were three Spider-Men that came later on that I really liked but didn\u2019t have too much exposition on them, but it made sense for them not to have to much. Throughout the film when we meet all the Spider-Men they do exposition on them and they do it in a comedic way and for those three they didn\u2019t need to go too deep so it worked. Also the villain of the story, King Pin, had a great design and looked like a good villain but he kind of failed a little. I could see his views after his backstory was revealed but I wanted just a little more out of him. This film had some of the best animation I\u2019ve ever seen. They made it like a comic book and it looked beautiful. Also the movie is a bit trippy so some of the scenes were just beautiful looking. I could talk about this movie for a long while but I don\u2019t want to get into spoilers. If you love Marvel and Spider-Man there is no way to be disappointed. I would recommend it for sure. It\u2019ll be nominated for Best Animated Feature for the Oscars (it was nominated for the Golden Globes). It\u2019s now hard to say if this or Incredibles 2 will win. This movie has higher ratings but Incredibles 2 is Disney and they almost always win. Once again see it! I absolutely loved Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse!!! My Grade: A",

            "content": "First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we've all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don't know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you'll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn't the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a \"Marvel\"ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would've been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would've been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn't overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn't make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you'll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn't overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody. I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse a 10/10.",

And even Fisk feels a bit like his real-life version on Netflix's Daredevil show -- only much, much LARGER of a figure.\n\nI'm simply blown away by the direction of this film, and can't even comprehend how they put such a fast-paced animated film together. The voice acting isn't bad either -- in fact, my new favorite spider-man might be Noir though I was hoping a bit more effort from Cage in masking his voice.\n\nSeriously though, what kind of radical 2-D. 3-D mashup of animating style did they use!?? I'm blown away by it. And there is a LOT of music peppered through the film, it's good, it fits and takes up about 1/2 of the credits.\n\nThe whole family loved it.",

            "content": "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse What starts off as a typical Spider-Man origin story (a surprisingly original one at that) quickly descends into trip down a rabbit hole of pure chaotic madness that results in one of the most spectacular, if not a tad over-ambitious, movies of the year. Incredibles 2 is the best animated movie of the year, there\u2019s no question and no debating that. However, Into the Spider-Verse May just be the best animated film. This movie is truly unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. The only other comic book movies I can think of where they felt like they were ripped straight from the pages are the Sin City and 300 movies. And considering those movies were live action as opposed to animated is high praise for this movie. I tend to throw around the word \u2018unique\u2019 when describing any movie, but in this case, I can\u2019t think of a better word to describe this film. It is unique. I had always heard whispers of the character Miles Morales, famous for being a mixed race iteration of the iconic Marvel hero. But it wasn\u2019t until this movie that I realized just how much of an extraordinary character he is. He\u2019s smart, relatable, and even more powerful than Peter Parker in some aspects. He carries this insane movie from start to finish and you\u2019re always rooting for him. I not only expect to see more of Morales in the future, I anticipate it! As I\u2019ve said, the animation in this movie is nothing like you\u2019ve ever seen before. When I heard Sony animation was doing an animated Spider-Man movie my first thought was, \u201cOh great! Sony\u2019s further capitalizing on its Spider-Man brand by showing Peter Parker dance to James Brown in animated form\u201d. Thankfully that is far from the case here. Though don\u2019t put it past this movie to not include a few self-deprecating sight gags. The animation here is quite similar to stop motion, in the sense that it\u2019s not supposed to feel as clean cut as Pixar and DreamWorks. There are several moments in this movie where it feels like a frame or two has been taken out to further establish the illusion that you\u2019re watching a series of comic book panels come to life. It\u2019s a remarkable aesthetic, though it can at times feel a bit distracting to someone who may not be prepared for what they\u2019re about to get from this movie. There were times where I actually found myself wondering if the theater projectionist had accidentally switched the movie with a 3-D print. There are moments inter-spliced throughout the film where the image looks double with one side red and the other side green. It wasn\u2019t until after I saw the movie that I realized this was intentional. Which is interesting for sure, but if you\u2019re seeing this movie, which I still highly suggest you do, and you have a pair of old red and blue 3-D glasses on hand, I recommend you take them along just in case. This is my only real issue with the movie and it\u2019s part of the reason why the movie feels like it over extends itself to some degree. The visuals and animation in this movie are so colorful and so eye-popping that it\u2019s easy to get lost in the sheer spectacle of it all. There\u2019s a moment about thirty minutes in where there is so much being thrown at you at once that you find yourself wondering if you\u2019re really watching what you think you\u2019re watching. From that moment onward the movie looks and feels like something Lewis Carol would piece together had he been an artist for Marvel comics. It\u2019s no understatement that Sony Animation has had a rough climb up to now. They\u2019ve had a few decent hits (2006\u2019s Open Season) and more than enough epic misfires (last year\u2019s Emoji Movie). Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is without question their best film yet. As a matter of fact, seeing as Disney, Pixar, and DreamWorks dominate the computer animated league, Laika has stop motion, and Studio Ghibli will continue to use classic 2-D, Sony should seriously consider making more movies like Into the Spider-Verse. This kind of stylized, meta-humor filled, animated comic book spectacle is a great niche for the company. And while their live action Spider-Man fare will most likely continue down a more mindless entertainment route like Venom, a movie like Into the Spider-Verse can really establish the company as a tent pole animation studio the same way that Toy Story and Snow White put Pixar and Disney on the map in their respective times. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a great movie. It\u2019s visually spectacular, absolutely hilarious, quite moving at times, and it acts as a brilliant showcase for Miles Morales as a character and for Sony Animation\u2019s capability as a legit studio in league with Disney and Pixar. My only issues being that the spectacle overwhelms the story and character development at times. But people must have had similar complaints about Toy Story when that movie first premiered. And look where we are now. In time, Into the Spider-Verse will most certainly be regarded as an unprecedented animated classic. A- ****1/4",

Miles is a very investing character due to his relationships and personality, he contains powers that the other Spider-People do not therefore he is a very tantalizing character for the audience, presenting us with a different kind of hero; this film shows us that a Spider-Man movie can work without Peter Parker in the main role. His origin is actually more relatable and engaging than most superheroes and withstands fantastic character development. That said the other Spider-People are just as fun as Miles, who all have their own special abilities that are exciting and fresh. The standout supporting hero here is Spider-Ham, giving us a more humorous and irreverent character which is always a joy on screen especially when he is oblivious to his surrounding in this new dimension. However, Spider-Noir is a welcome addition to the cast but deserved a more in depth arc. But apart from our heroes there are a lot more juicy things here to easily titillate. The animation is one of them which is extremely fresh and is a unique style that has never been tried before and really shows off the fact that it's essentially a comic book that has come to life. There are bundle loads of Easter Eggs including call backs to the original films (and a recreation of the infamous Emo Dance) and the original 60's books which sometimes help navigate Miles' responsibilities as Spider-Man and what he can do with his newfound capabilities, this concept will please all Spidey fans including myself. Other things worth noting is the voice work as it is extremely well said and each voice actor suits there character with Shameik Moore providing an exceptionally good vocal performance as Miles, and the humour which is witty and slick and the laugh out loud jokes are frequent and doesn't take away the tonal consistency and there are a few emotional scenes in the film and the dialogue between some characters pulls on the heart-strings as well as some surprising plot twists. Finally, the action sequences soar and bounce off the screen and are intense as well as visually stunning and the costume design is basically awesome. \n\nThis Spider-Flick doesn't go completely unscathed though. Kingpin was a terrible villain with poor motivations and an awful character design, he did turn out as a cliche villain unfortunately. The ending did get a bit too predictable and I would of liked a lot of depth and detail to the story and I would of liked more screen time with the supporting heroes e.g. Spider-Ham, Spider-Noir, Spider-Gwen and Peni Parker. As the film progressed it seemed like it was going faster than it should of been going. But overall, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse will seem like Christmas for the long-term Spider-Man fans. It tells a perfect Spider-Man story which includes a strong lead hero and an unique style of animation; even though Kingpin was a terrible villain, our terrific heroes make up for it. This new comic book film is essentially the don't miss movie this winter and exceeded my expectations. Sony has finally proven that they are capable of producing a near perfect Spidey feature which is a breath of fresh air, considering the fact that Spider-Man is a character who has been rebooted several times onto the big screen. A spinoff and a sequel are in the works and I'm not going to shy away from the fact that I'm excited for them, especially after the result of this film.",

I also was not the least bit concerned about the safety of the any of the contrived stereotype characters, nor was I worried about the danger Kingpin\u2019s device placed the Spider-Man universe in. This seemed like a film devised by Marvel and Disney corporate strategists to draw in more minority and female fans more then a legitimate super hero film. Black Panther pulled this off extremely well and built up a fascinating new world. This film tried to build 5 whole new Spider-Man worlds and only ended up with a flimsy cartoon best suited to kids age 11-14. I\u2019m also sadly predicting they start production on more of these turd films and possibly spin offs starring the other spider men, women, and spider pig.",

            "content": "Sony hasn't exactly been kind to the Spider-Man universe and its lore the last couple of years since Sam Raimi (gracefully) decided to call quits on continuing his series of films after Spider-Man 3 was essentially forced to be finished by Sony due to creative disagreements. And since then a failed (and deserved tbh) rebooted series, iffy and bad spin-off to a well utilized villain, and refusing to give just in general the rights back to the character to Marvel haven't necessarily been in favour to the studio (not even counting what happened with Ghostbusters and their comedy films.) So suffice to say I wasn't, very worried how despite how surprisingly blown away I was by the animation from the marketing material for this film came along I wasn't, still worried as hell (and Sony Animation? You mean the same people of The Emoji Movie? *Shudders* no please god no.) But then the names of Phil Lord and Chris Miller (two duo directors i've heavily respected and enjoyed from The Lego Movie and One High) were attached, with Phil taking screenwriting credit and Chris producing, and suddenly I felt myself get a bit excited given their talent. And once the marketing got me assured that this wasn't being completely tampered by Sony, I kept my excitement and finally got to see the film finally. And seeing it the first time I came out of it feeling \" a bit underwhelmed that this didn't grab me as much as I hoped it would\", I think after another re-watch I can say while that may ring still, I'm still happy to say that it's still a damn fun ride that does manage to FINALLY add and give Spider-Man fans (myself included) another nice iteration of the universe.\n\nAs before with having some personal gripes on how some of the story was handled, I can say now that while being very great to its core, some things that did hold me back from enjoying it fully with small issues ike dialogue often feeling a bit weirdly forced in exposition from time to time, personal preference of some of the rap songs feeling really pointless and forced (still the Sony ones, except Sunflower), and a personal preference worth mentioning for using for the sequel: missing A HUGE chance to give the film some more runtime and pacing (Ala Lego Movie) with the alternative Peter Parker (and Gwen's especially) to help tie into the arc to Miles, and only one major issue with unfortunately a lot of the pacing of  hurting some of the scripts story and clear emotional moments and as a result can make especially Miles story just a tad underwhelming. But other than that, I'm happy to report that the team involved with the Spiderverse material really put a lot of heart and soul with absolutely no-duh beautiful and sometimes jaw-breaking animation that really is a first and rather than feeling pretentious adds so much character to Spidey as a whole it just goes without saying to mention its amazing, a very solid script courtesy of Phil Lord and Rodeny Rothman that shows a lot of just great wit but especially understanding to emotional weight and investment that sure has its hiccups due to its pacing still shines through when it does work, the themes and especially its emotional impact when it's presented in the story feeling genuinely engaging, speaking of which the character work for Miles especially working so well being a re-work of his origin story and emotionally all the way just works so well and I loved every second of it, all of its goofy but yet especially serious tone and even mature character work working so beautifully well, a very surprisingly well oriented score that actually probably gives some of my favourite Spider-Man music since Danny Elfman's, all of its cast really owning their roles very well (especially Shameik Moore's Miles who despite not even being a darn kid like gets the feel of the character so surprisingly well on top of Jake Johnson's typical but still off-beat performance and Hailee Steinfield unrecognizable but great work on Gwen; its clear they put a lot of work and feeling to their characters.)\n\nSo goes without saying that Into the Spider-Verse is definitely a great ride, and definitely this time around feeling much more impactful and entertaining with a second watch. And while it may not be something i'll see myself ALL the time going back to due to its very minor but weird inconsistencies, still for what we got it's a great rendition and take on all of Spider-Man that it ain't worth missing out on, so definitely check this out when you can and give it some love (even if it IS Sony) cause it definitely deserves it! Oh and all I can say is if you enjoy a lot of the inside joke memes of Spider-Man, just all I can say is stay till the end credits. I promise you won't be disappointed.",

Still, there's far more to this movie than a mindless escape. There was the incredibly unique animation style, truly bringing the wonderfully ridiculous nature of comic books to life on the big screen. The complex story was simplified into a comprehendible narrative, told in a remarkably entertaining, amusing, and self-aware fashion.\nFrom there, you had the rich soundtrack perfectly complimenting the style and themes. On top of all this, there was deep character development, palpable emotion, and true, honest life lessons, derived from none other than the late Stan Lee. This is perhaps on par with any other Spider-Man movie ever created, if not even above their caliber. The following quote, included in the credits perfectly sums up the film: \"That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed, without a doubt, a real superhero.\" - Stan Lee",

I also liked seeing subtle references toward the Spider-Verse comics such as the Web-Warriors Jeep in the Spidey-Lair. \nThough I'm a nerd and enjoyed it, this movie isn't just for nerds, and don't think it's just a soft kid movie. It is extremely dark in some parts, and can work for basically all audiences to enjoy. The dark elements weren't too dark for kids, though, so it's a great film that every kid and adult to enjoy! I can't thank the creators enough for their hard work and how much life they put into these comics. It is definitely my favorite Marvel movie so far, and I don't think it can easily be beat.

I really love the inclusion of so many different \"spider-people\" you have Miles Morales, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and even Spider-Ham. It just made the movie even that more fun.\n\nYou don't need to watch any Spider-Man movies prior to seeing this, but if you have (or read the comics) it is loaded with cameo's and easter eggs. While this movie can look flashy and have a whole lot pumped into it, this is simply Miles' story, his journey, and a joy to watch.... Stan Lee also has the perfect send-off cameo (that I may have shed a tear at).\n\noh, and also stay to the end of the credits for this one.\nit's pretty great.",

            "content": "Growing up, I grew an appreciation for the character of Spider-Man that I've never been able to develop for any other comic book character. It was Sam Raimi's original live-action trilogy that hooked me and had me scrounging for more. Watching countless episodes of every cartoon iteration, and even starting to read a few of the comics, I found myself becoming a huge fan of this generational icon. Once Spider-Man 3 hit theatres, the character had lost all hope on the big screen, until Andrew Garfield took the role from Tobey Maguire, which didn't last too long, and also crashed and burned. Finally, he found his footing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Holland, but none of that matters when watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Not only is this the best that this character has been in a while, but I believe there's a real argument to made that this is possibly the greatest feature-length film based on this character, period.\n\nIn this film, which is loosely based off of storylines that are very similar to how this movie plays out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales as he's bitten by a radioactive spider and develops the same (and more) powers as his hero, Spider-Man. After an event opens a portal, it's revealed that his universe isn't the only one. There are endless dimensions out there with parallel characters and creatures, all with similar backstories. From Spider-Gwen to Spider-Ham, this film explores the classics as well as the bizarre, which I fear will probably turn off some average moviegoers who haven't experienced these characters yet, but if you can't embrace a film like that, it's probably not for you anyways.\n\nFrom the very first teaser trailer, I was very intrigued by the look of this film and how different it looked from most animated films out there today. With only a couple of notable films in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Arthur Christmas, Sony Pictures hasn't had the best track record in terms of releasing animated movies theatrically. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has given new life to that notion, because this isn't only the best they've ever produced in my opinion, but it's the best animated movie that has come out all year. The unique style leaps off the screen and made me find another layer to love, on top of the fantastic storyline and characters surrounding it.\n\nYes, the origin story of Peter Parker is the one that everyone knows. That is very much present here again, and nearly every one of these characters share similar backgrounds, but it feels as though the filmmakers expect the audience to be in on the joke of that. This movie is very meta at times, and it works very well if you're invested in the movie as a whole. At the emotional core of this movie is how these characters differ from one another and how certain circumstances can be worse than others. There are some fantastic life lessons to be learned by children here, and for that, I only loved this movie even more.\n\nIn the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse impressed me on many levels. It gives you the Spider-Man action that you've come to expect from this character, as well as giving new life to it. The character of Miles Morales has just as many layers to his story as the classic Peter Parker one, but the inclusion of each one of the side characters here fleshes him out even more. This is one of the best superhero origin stories I've seen on the big screen in years. Filled with heart, emotion, plenty of action, and eye-candy as far as the eye can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of my favourite films of the year.",

            "content": "Sony has a track record for some hits and A LOT of misses when it comes to Marvel and Spider-man movies. \n\nSo I was on the fence with Venom and for me it was an Okay type of movie. And I will be honest, I was VERY Biased when it comes to the trailer of this movie; and being that Amy Pascal (2016 Ghostbuster's fame) is the first name you see when the movie starts was very Jarring to me. And after seeing the first two trailers while i enjoyed the visual artwork I guess because Sony has a habit of showing EVERYTHING in their trailers I was apprehensive about this movie; it was after watching, 'Venom' and the end credits and the 15 mins trailer I figured I owe it to myself to keep an open mind and go see this movie even if it was another cash-grab.......\n\n......I have to honestly eat crow. Cause Spider-man: Into the spider verse...is by far and away the BEST visually, original, emotional and fun movie animated movie I've seen in a while since Lego batman and Lego movie and all three are written by Phil Lord. \n\nThe writing is snappy and fun, the movie has a lot of heart. The origin to Miles Morales while a tad different than the comic version (Just a tad); is still enjoyable to watch...and Miles himself is such an endearing character his dynamic to the other Spider-people and his family had me grinning from ear to ear and I was surprised to find out who voiced Spider-Noir as well as Kingpin, etc. \nThey don't shy away from telling you what happen to Spider man in Miles's universe and there's a lot of emotional tear jerking moments that while for some other movies it would seem forced but in this it seems to be part of the course. Off the bat you know Miles life is very different from Peter parker's life but the same at the same time. Then there's Peter B. Parker...the 'What happens when Spider man just let himself go\" voiced by Jake Johnson the chemistry between Miles and Peter is one of hilarity but also holds the emotional weight when they work together to fix each others lives in more ways than one. And adding on to this is the amazing soundtrack that matches the feel of Brooklyn life and while there's some hits and misses my favorite is, \"What's up Danger\" as Miles step into his destiny as the new Spider-man it gives me goosebumps when you hear it as he comes to terms being the hero he was meant to be. \n\nIf you're wondering would i get lost in the majority of the story? simple answer is no. Not only they give you each introduction but they do it in a way in which you will fully understand their backgrounds. This is catered for both kids as well as adults (mostly for adults at times) but just as fun for kids too. \n\nThere's a lot I want to say but saying it would spoil the movie and I don't want to do that. Visually this is one of the best looking animated movie that uses the idea of your old school comic book and I would love this movie to win an award for best animation and music. \nthe Easter eggs and cameos are both fun and emotional cause when you see a certain cameo it made me tear up a bit (actually a lot) but It was a good way of solidifying his immortality. \nI can honestly say i would love to see this movie again. I would love to get this movie on Digital or 4k when it comes to it; I would love to see a sequel to this movie cause there's so many set ups they can do with this (Superior Spider-man anyone?) and stay for the post credit scene cause it had me in tears (Laughing) at possibilities for other movies. \n\nIt seems Spider-man found its footing. MCU, PS4, and now in Animated form. Can't wait to see what they can do with this. \n\nI'm done with venom. lol",

It is easy to make a concept like the 'Spiderverse' - essentially a multiverse that cold require a physics lesson - complication and convoluted however the film is able to explain this clearly and consisely. Bar far, the standout for this film is the animation style. You can really tell that Sony let go of the reins and let Sony Imageworks have fun. It is equal parts pop art, expressionism, street art and comic book style art with a liberal use of Bed Day dots and though bubbles and fantastic details that will be enjoyed by children and adults alike.

We know Peter Parker, MJ, Aunt May and the rest of the Parker social circle. We don't need that to be beaten into our heads again and it knew that. It connects the dots without showing you the process of running the string. What I love is how much it truly understood what it was. It moved quickly and got us into the action but knew just how much information to give you so you knew what was going on and enough so you can look up more later. The way it brought the Spider-Family together and gave them personality so quickly is really a testament to the art style, film direction and the way it told the store. I actually got choked up in a scene and I just met these characters an hour ago.\n\nI honestly believe this is the first step in what can be a truly robust and fleshed out franchise for Sony. The team they put on this knew just what we needed and it wasn't more high school Peter Parker. We have one and he's doing a great job and his next story is around the corner; so let's highlight a new range of characters in the same universe. Well not actually the same universe; the whole multi-verse thing is at play after all. I want to see more of this and it looks like they know that.\n\nI have a feeling they know how much ass they just kicked and they plan on kicking some more.",

It\u2019s actually my favorite Spider-Man film and this is the most comic booky movie I\u2019ve ever seen. Like idk how to describe it without spoiling it but it really does feel super comic book style. I was worried I was going to hate spider Gwen. With her punk hair I thought she was going to be super gay and all EUGH! Men! Respect my vagina! I am beyond relieved that she was an amazing character. She actually was one of my favorite characters in the film I\u2019d say she, Miles, and Peter are easily the most relatable characters and it\u2019s so easy to love them and route for them. I also really loved Nicholas cage as Noir Spider-Man. Honestly this movie is one of the funniest superhero films I\u2019ve ever seen with actual jokes. Not baby humor we see in the MCu. Like actual time and effort was put into these jokes Not OoohooOOooo he fell down! What a silly clown! OooooOO does the baby love that joke??? Oopsie he bumped his head now? Does the baby love that joke?? More like actual real humor. Course this movie is also considerably dark as in it\u2019s a serious gritty film not all comedic. I also could relate with the villain and I thought they did an amazing job with the villain. After black Panther I was worried it\u2019s impossible to have a black comic book movie that isn\u2019t all about black power! Ans spending the entire film hating on white people. I am so so so glad there were no politics in this film. No politics no SJW just an amazing film. This isn\u2019t a black movie. It\u2019s a comic book movie. It\u2019s a Spider-Man movie. It doesn\u2019t matter if Spider-Man happens to be black or white. They are different people. They each identify themselves as their own unique person and they are defined by exactly that. Not their skin color I ended up loving Miles. This movie was sad sweet beautiful emotional. They did a amazing job with this film and I highly recommend it. Oh as a side note it was clearly made for 3D. I may be being very bias supporting this film so much. The colors may hurt your eyes depending on how good your vision is. I didn\u2019t mind it but I also thought about this movie and felt like yeah I can see how this movie could really hurt your eyes depending on your vision After seeing this film I think a few things are clear. As South Park has joked, we can\u2019t just get hung up over a tiny remark someone makes on Twitter. Maybe they aren\u2019t a racist elitist like it seemed they were. My final remark about this film is this. I am now laughing my ass off because if this movie skyrockets as Venom did, that means no more Spider-Man for MCU. You can bet your ass Sony doesn\u2019t like Disney and is looking for any excuse to yank away from Disney. If this movie explodes in sales while Disney is going super SJW with Carol MANvers, you can bet Sony is pulling all its content away from Disney and I can\u2019t wait for the day that Disney loses Spider-Man to the company that made the Emoji Movie!

The animation is some of the best I've seen.\n\nCons: I would have liked to spend more time with some of the secondary villains and \"Spider-people\".\n\nOverall: This is a great movie. This is a great Sider-Man movie. It's awesome that we can get this AND the version from the MCU proper. I wouldn't say it's my favorite Spider-Man movie (that honor still goes to Spider-Man 2), but it gets the character right in ways that nothing else, so far, has. Seeing Miles Morales get his due is also a real treat. Especially if you have kids, go see it.\n\nGrade: A+",

Every joke lands. And it's really aware of current pop culture and inserts some spicy memes at just the right times. The animation is absolutely stunning. Everything pops perfectly. The visuals in this movie rivel that of Akira or Blade Runner. The story is well written and risk-taking as it chooses to include some pretty obscure spider-people from the comics. The plot makes sense and the pacing is just right. It's funny, has heart, action packed, and visually perfect. 10/10",

            "content": "This is easily the best Spider-Man movie I will ever see, not just \"have seen\". To achieve better would mean to take the sort of risk in live action (the parts that aren't CG animated) that is easily afforded to animation. It's part-origin, part-zillionth-sequel, part-spoof, and all experiment gone wild. It's a superhero movie that knows it's one while still feeling fresh, allowing a singular perspective to guide the story, and it is highly deceptive, frontloading the proceedings with comedy, only to clobber the viewer with naturally occuring drama from seemingly out of nowhere. By creating consistent parallels between the Spider-Heroes, it lays a clear path as to what Miles must ultimately submit to according to Spider-Hero logic: one step forward, too many steps back.\n\nThis does come with a caveat however, one I've theorized for quite a long time: while emulating the aspects of a superhero comic book in its mad dash of a runtime, this movie posits an obvious superiority as an adaptation, which serves as a lament toward graphic storytelling in general. Usually in an action comic, actions and dialogue occupy the same space with mere regard to telling the most economic story at the behest of pacing and impact. In many instances, there are entire panels filled with spoken dialogue, inner narration, and exposition blocks, sometimes simultaneously. I can't help but to feel that this clutter is a prime cause as to why superhero comics remain a niche market (although manga tends to have much better regard toward these issues, mainly because most of it is geared to be adapted to anime). This movie knows when to tell and when to show.\n\nI haven't heard rap used this effectively in film since Above the Rim, accenting the variety of the proceedings as part-score. As for the other part-score, Pemberton is more than up for the challenge, between the growling motif for Prowler, the dextrous synchronicity during the Spider-Cave sequence, and many more cues. If he devotes his work solely to animation, he's got an instant fan right here.\n\nI can only hope that Ralph Bakshi gets a gander at the post-credit sequence.",

Endorsing its ownself into a comical idea that jumpstarts this cat and mouse chase is less promising and more exciting. The first act involves your usual teenage drama that feels like an indie film, a surprising take by Marvel. But all this trickery is shattered pretty much in its first few minutes, as this visual galore swings you like a toddler and you are beames back into your childhood memories.\n\nThis vision of yours is too shattered by the makers by complicating the linear humane tale into a labyrinthe of dual identities that keeps multiplying like an algorithm which keeps you at the brisk of your seat and challenges you to stay with the storytelling. And this is where the makers shine, despite of being gifted a plethora of tracks or ideas and being free of all logistics, they have sticked to an arguably a simpler one that is constructed well enough for the audience to nod along. Similar to any other animated feature, it makes it more juicy due to its tied hands, the conflicts that the lead characters are piled upon is what makes it electrifying.\n\nBut this is Lord's world at some point. And his pacing vocab can easily be pointed out in here. Similar to The Lego Movie, there are too many characters to adore on screen and each of them trying to whirl you around with their hilarious innuendos or their own sub-plots or pointing out the obvious on the stage. It is the Lego phase all over again. You are too overwhelmed at times, to enjoy it thoroughly. You are too busy to catch up with what's going on that you do feel left out.\n\nThere is a sense of incompetency in the air, ironically due to overstuffed material. And this is something that can itch to few viewers as you feel being cheated. Personally, I enjoy such narration, it challenges me to push my boundaries and snaps at me on every frame for my attention. The action is more \"cool\" than it is smart, the artists are stealing the awe struck moments as much as they can. And with a new smooth visual effects like such, they do add the literal transcript on screen and the infamous comic sound effects written out aloud in front of you.\n\nThe voice cast has done a decent work but there isn't much for them to factor than few show stealing one liners that stay with you, even after the curtains are dropped for long; the Spider-Man Noir learning the colors on cube still cracks me up. But amidst all these glossy distraction there is, the theme, the gist, is still the same old drama, no matter what Peter says in here, I am going to complete the sentence, \"With great powers comes great responsibilities.\" Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse is a family drama that swings its way out to create that arc into a full circle.",

The movie threads a fine line between being realistic and being outlandish, and  it works. The story does a good job of knowing when to be humorous and fun, while also not taking away from parts where it has to be serious. Come to think of it, the movie kind of resembles Homecoming, where the movie is less about saving the world, but more about spider-man himself. All the characters are also well developed towards the end, which adds to the enjoyment. Fun, emotional and thoroughly enjoyable, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is all I could've wanted in a movie to close out the year, and is definitely one of the best (if not the best) movies this year.",

The voice actors did an amazing job and i loved the storyline it was very clever and unique compared to the animated films i\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ve seen of late. i actually cared about the characters because they have depth and character development! i can really tell that a lot of love and dedication and spidey lore research went into this movie. It has a lot of heart. To all the people complaining about the animation. You do realize it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s supposed to be like a moving comic... if you don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t like comics then don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t go see this movie.. it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s that easy.

It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s just very different than the mainstream animation we presently have and are used to. if you\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)re a huge spider-man fan and like movies that actually have substance to the plot (instead of just pretty animation to cover up the fact that the plot sucks and took no effort) definitely go see this movie, you\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)re in for a treat :)",

Seriously this story is so full of charm and heart, and the best part is that Miles' journey isn't rushed at all. This isn't a long film, but it still takes its time to give the main characters their narrative arcs. There are some excellent comedic moments, wonderful easter eggs to search for, and of course a heartwarming cameo by Stan Lee.\n\nThe entire voice cast is remarkable as well - Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson as Peter, Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, Mahershala Ali, Liev Schreiber, and so so many more! There are so many surprise voice cameos that I won't spoil here, look them up if you're interested but they are definitely pleasant surprises.

The villains...well, the main villains got me to invest, the rest of them...were video game bosses. Not to say they were bad!

            "content": "December 14, 2018\n\n\"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" is a bright, edgy and imaginative adventure-bold, bustling and alive, all in a safe, mainstream-superhero-movie sort of way. From its pulsating first frame, it's easy to tell the film's three directors, Bob Perischetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman, have only love and affection for the their titular hero and what he stands for, although they also know he should be capable of evolving, and with this inaugural computer-animated version of the legendary figure, they've taken what will hopefully be the first step toward a Spider-Man movie that's everything \"Into the Spider-Verse\" is only less safe. For now, though, we can bask in this one's notable risks and many achievements.\n\nThe risks I refer to include this being the first Spider-Man movie to feature a non-white and non-male version of the hero, not to mention a non-human. Following \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Black Panther,\" this may not seem like such a big a deal, but given that Spider-Man is often viewed as the default and most exemplary superhero in popular culture, it makes the idea of them being more diverse all the more common and accepted.\n\nThis latest adaptation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's beloved Marvel Comics character, which is cheerfully aware of and recognizes all the previous live-action Spidey incarnations that have come before it, kicks off with Spider-Man/Peter Parker (voice of Chris Pine) giving us a quick recap of how he came to be (promptly summarizing the whole \"radioactive spider thing\") and bringing us up to speed on what he's doing now. At 26, he's married to Mary Jane Watson (Zoe Kravitz); is still saving New York City from utter devastation on a routine basis; has started his own product line; and is still fending off enemies, old and new.\n\nOne of his latest haters is a by-the-books, no-nonsense cop named Jefferson Davis (Brian Tyree Henry), who doesn't agree with Spidey's unorthodox crime-fighting methods. The opposite holds true for Jefferson's son, Miles (Shameik Moore), who will be the movie's chief protagonist. Miles secretly admires Spider-Man, having read the comics written about his true-life adventures. Deep down, perhaps Miles senses he and Spider-Man/Peter Parker aren't all that different from each other. After all, both are intellectually gifted yet socially insecure, although to us, Miles may have it even harder than Peter ever did because he's the son of an African-American father and Hispanic mother (Luna Lauren Velez), which, although the movie doesn't explicitly address this trait (or its social ramifications), we appreciate as one of the qualities that makes Miles a more unique character. \n\nDespite his academic talents, Miles hates the boarding school his parents send him to, which is just outside of his hometown of Brooklyn. He thinks it's elitist and being there makes him feel like he's betraying his own kind. He tries to get himself kicked out by deliberately failing, but his teachers see through him and won't let him.\n\nLike many adolescents, Miles finds solace in making art, particularly spray-painting murals, and he's able to talk about his woes with his Uncle Aaron (Mahershala Ali), who watches over the kid but clearly has a dark side, which is probably why Miles' father and Aaron are estranged brothers. \n\nOne night, Aaron takes Miles into the subway to paint and, wouldn't you know, down comes a radioactive spider (not unlike the one that found Peter) and bites him on the wrist. As the story goes, Miles begins to transform-his body grows; he develops a Spidey sense; and his fingers start to stick to things, including the hair of the girl he likes at school, who calls herself \"Gwendola\" (Hailee Steinfeld) and has a secret of her own.\n\nThe plot thickens once Miles makes contact with the original Spider-Man, who's in a heated battle with the Green Goblin and, shortly thereafter, the crime lord Kingpin (Liev Schreiber), who's built a giant mechanism that, for all intents and purposes, disrupts the time-space continuum and opens a portal to parallel universes (his motivation for constructing such a device is something I'll let you discover). Without giving too much of this increasingly layered plot away, Miles' own dimension suddenly becomes inhabited by five other Spider-People, including an older, out-of-shape and recently divorced Peter \"B.\" Parker (Jake Johnson), who reluctantly becomes Miles' mentor; Spider-Gwen, the aforementioned female version of the hero; Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), a Japanese school girl who operates her own spider robot called \"SP//dr\"; Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), a dark version of Spider-Man who, with his black trench coat and fedora, resembles Rorschach from \"The Watchmen\"; and Peter Porker/Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), an anthropomorphic pig. Yes, a pig.\n\nResearch tells me each of these alternate versions of Spider-Man actually has his or her roots in various Spider-Man comics and/or video games, which surprised me because I just assumed they were created specifically for this film. Nevertheless, \"Into the Spider-Verse\" provides them each a worthy backstory and pools them together to thwart Kingpin and his chief engineer/partner-in-crime, Dr. Livia Octavius, a.k.a. Doc Ock (Kathryn Hahn). With so many characters and an impressively intricate plot, the movie is surprisingly coherent and builds into a rich, action-packed adventure with strong moments of character development; witty, self-deprecating humor; and even true, heartfelt emotion. \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" is nothing if not well-rounded.\n\nThe film's most striking feature, of course, is its animation, which is virtually boundless and allows the action to move with the kind of fluidity and freedom that only animation can provide. The filmmakers have utilized their resources to a full and mesmerizing degree, filling all corners of the screen with vibrant colors and often dazzling set pieces (as far as computer-animated set pieces go). And despite this being computer animation, the characters possess full weight and dimension, thanks in large part to the fitting and memorable voice casting, particularly Moore as Miles, Henry as Miles' father, and Ali as Uncle Aaron. They prove they don't just enliven live-action characters but have just as much presence as the voices of animated ones.\n\nIf I could change anything about \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\" it would be the main conflict, which, after an energetic setup, eventually settles on a mostly traditional superhero plot. You know the drill: the good guys must defeat the bad guys in a limited amount of time; and the main hero must learn to accept the things he cannot change, harness his powers, and rise above his own personal feelings and insecurities to fight for the greater good. This has become the sort of \"go-to\" Spider-Man story, which was my underlying problem with the otherwise fine \"Spider-Man: Homecoming.\" And while I understand a big-budget animated feature such as this probably needed to tread familiar territory before it can venture too far on its own, I also couldn't help but think that with everything this film has at its disposal, both technically and casting-wise, it had potential to be a near-masterpiece, if only the plot taken more of a gamble and introduced problems to Miles and company that were less predictable. \n\nStill, I did appreciate the film for at least being aware of its own exhausted devices and tropes and how it even had the nerve to poke fun at some of them, including the famous, \"With great power comes great responsibility\" line. This attitude made me think that if the film does well enough and there's a sequel, the filmmakers will feel they can break new ground narratively as much as they have visually.\n\nRegardless of my minor reservations about it, \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" is a splendid treat, and both ardent and casual fans of Spider-Man should find it thoroughly engaging, humorous and touching. It takes the cinematic incarnation of Spider-Man as we know it and points it in a much-needed newer direction, while at the same time it helps solidify the idea of diversity in mainstream superhero movies as the new norm. Above all, though, it's just enormously entertaining, and despite how prolific superhero movies have become, particularly those about Spider-Man, the filmmakers have not taken for granted the bare essentials it takes to make a good movie-name character, story and heart, all of which \"Into the Spider-Verse\" shows off to great effect.",

Minimal expositional dialogue gives way to creative visual devices and recalls that are implemented so satisfyingly because they treat the audience like the smart people that we are.\n\nIf you are looking for humor (meta or slapstick), lessons on power and responsibility, shocking twists (for non-comic book readers), meaningful cameos, tear-jerking emotional scenes, action-packed sequences, then you are ready to swing into this universe.

Using writing on par with Guardians of the Galaxy in terms of creating such a cohesive, creative, and varied multiverse that while being so unique and different still feels whole and connected, the crew manages to tell a story of so wildly varied characters coming together as a team feel so natural and effortless. The animation is indescribable to me beyond being the most literal realization of the phrase \u201cEvery Frame A Painting\u201d that has ever been put to film. ITSV has changed the superhero climate forever, and in my opinion, we are all so much better off as an audience because of it.

This movie is not only going to redefine what an animated movie should look like, it's going to raise the expectation level of what any superhero movie should feel like.

I actually tried to find a scene or moment where the animators maybe cheaped out or half-assed something and I couldn't.  Every scene, every sequence . . . hell, every frame was stunning.\n\nThe protagonist is Miles Morales, an accidental spiderman set in our world and the writers do a great job of really developing him well in a very short time.  An alternate universe Peter Parker also enters our world and his  character harkens back to the Sam Raimi films and genuflects to Raimi's Spiderman 1 and 2 and justifiably jibes Spiderman 3.  There's also Spiderwoman, Film Noir Spiderman, Anime Spidergirl and Spiderpig.  If I had any complaint, it's that these last three characters seem tacked on in anticipation of sequels or extended universe planning.  \n\nAlso, this movie had hands-down the best Stan Lee cameo ever.  You may think it's more sentimental because of his passing just recently and that may be a factor but I assure you that's not why it's great.  It's like they finally figured out the best way to portray the great creator in a way fitting to his legacy.\n\nDefinitely stick around until the very end of the credits. Yes, I'm pointing at you!",

Turns out, this movie lives up to the hype, 100 percent. It is, hands down, my favorite superhero movie of this year. First, the animation is... lush, textured, colorful, striking,, electric, fluid, and a bunch of other synonyms that escape me now. Just... Wow. It's like the  brilliance of the final battle of the Incredibles 2 was distilled and liberally mixed through the whole movie. Second, the story is wonderful, taking an absurd multiverse story and running with it. There were so many ways for this to get muddled, confused, unfocused, but it never did. The characters are perfectly matched with their animations, and I swear that the spider-man voiced Nickolas Cage even had his mannerisms!  The heroes are wonderfully individual, the villains were both threatening and had solid motives, and the side characters are on point as well. Lastly, the writing is excellently paced and well marbled with humor. \nAll in all, I can't think of a movie I've enjoyed more recently, and I highly recommend you go see it.",

            "content": "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a rare breed in modern cinema, it's fearless. It doesn't feel beholden to expectations of what you think it should or could be. It feels like it was made in a vacuum like the filmmakers had a clear vision for how to make this work and stand out. How to make it not just another Spider-man movie, of which there are (too) many, but to make it its own beast. Much like our main protagonist Miles Morales having to find his own path to becoming Spider-Man, the secret is to do it your own way, add your own style, rhythm, and pace.\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has a style, and rhythm all of its own. I have never experienced anything like it. It is truly a comic book come to life. Nothing about it is traditional, the creative decisions are deliberate yet feel spontaneous and only serve to heighten the experience. This movie begs to be seen on the big screen, it's built for it, and if you choose to wait I feel bad for you that you missed out it on the grandest stage.\nSo, does that mean that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is all style and no substance? That's the most amazing part, no! Its style is matched completely by its story, heart, and humour. It's a complex story that is never spoon fed to the audience yet you completely get it. This is Miles' story, no doubt, but it has an eclectic group of Spider... people, each with their part to play. For all it's slick visuals and stunning action it takes the time to make you feel, to have you invest yourself completely. And yes, it's funny, genuinely so and for me, it never panders, as animated movies often do, to the little ones. Even though it gets a little dark, it's not disturbing, it's just genuine.\nThis is the kind of movie that needs a trilogy and/or more. It deserves to be seen and celebrated for the remarkable achievement that it is so that we do get more. More opportunities to push the boundaries and expectations for animated movies and also to see where these characters and the unlimited possibilities of the Spider-Verse can take us.",

How they manage each of the characters has a fair amount of time and enough character motivation without overshadowing each other. Overall I thought it was amazing movie with a perfect tone of being quirky, funny, clever, and emotional. At this point it is the best animated movie of the year, The best comic movie of the year and by far One of the best movie of the year.

The animation in this movie is beyond amazing, and it was so cool and interesting to see the way this movie was animated. That is really the highlight of this movie. Especially adding on to the fact that all the acting is fantastic, the dialogue is wonderful and rich, the characters are awesome and funny, and the story is fantastic and fresh. This by far is the best movie of the year, which is shocking and so unexpected. This beautifully paced, action packed, heart filled movie is the one you must see in the theater this Christmas.

            "content": "Proving that the Marvel magic need not be restricted to live-action blockbusters, along comes \"Into the Spider-Verse,\" with its aim to both celebrate and expand upon the Spider-Man mythos. Viewers that have only known Peter Parker to be the on-screen alter-ego of Spider-Man have to be willing to accept Miles Morales as the web-slinger in order for the film to work as intended. This movie hinges on their being able to appreciate and care about Morales, and from the first seconds seeing him in his room, wearing headphones and singing along to a favorite song before school, I did. He more than earns the mantle. The realities of his teenage existence - the awkwardness and the desire for acceptance - connect in a deeply meaningful way, not to mention that those scenes are also used to introduce another of the film's important characters. The mentor / mentee relationship between Miles and Peter Parker is also a pivotal theme in this film, with the latter being depicted in a fashion at odds with previous film incarnations. The arrival of alternate reality Spider-Men, -Women, & -Pigs gives the film its humor, while also underscoring the central conceit. As I was watching this movie, I thought back to the first time I viewed Spirited Away, another superior story fearlessly told through the spectrum of animation, whereby a kid is swept up into an adventure that tests preexisting notions concerning reality and travels into the realm of the fantastical. Miles' emerging discoveries about his powers, the alternate realities where other super-powered individuals reside, and his worthiness to be a hero, and not just any hero, but THE Spider-Man, are all part of the fun. The film also finds clever ways to pay tribute to Spider-Man lore - both the well-known and obscure facets - so those with an attentive eye will appreciate the many Easter eggs appearing throughout its running time. The story is ambitious, the characters fully realized, action-scenes are a thrill to behold, and the animation style provides a bountiful aesthetic to tell this story. I feel very confident asserting that \"Into the Spider-Verse\" is one of the best films of 2018, even though there are many candidates I still need to view. Whether young or old, the film's lasting message that anyone can be Spider-Man is the kind of encouragement everyone should register and find inspiring. The magic of movies is alive and well as long as films like this continue to be made. \"Into the Spider-Verse\" isnt just the best Spider-Man film to date, it's also an all-time great animated film. Walking out of the cinema, I already felt eagerness at the notion of my second viewing.",

Everything from the beautifully rendered scenes of New York to the super-related and lovable cast to the fast-paced and well-written plot are perfectly executed. It's hard to believe that this is a Sony production BUT we need to remind ourselves that they gave us Spider-Man 2 (which has been unseated as the best SM film ever :P). As a huge (understatement) Spider-Man fan, Miles' big screen debut is also the best incarnation of the character. It's as if writers Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman took everything great about Bendis's work, put this into the movie, and made the character even better. Combined with the perfectly casted Shameik Moore's voice talent, it's impossible to not relate to Miles. Old Peter Parker is great too as the reluctant mentor, but you feel the character's pains and woes and it feels refreshing for a character that's 50+ years old.\n\nInto the Spider-Verse is so good that I feel compelled to bring all my friends, especially those that aren't aware of how good animated or comic book movies can be, to see this movie. I think I'm going to do just that :)",

It's clear that the minds behind the story are fans of the source material. I personally found this to be one of the stronger animated films that 2018 has to offer and I feel it will do big things for Sony's animation studios.
