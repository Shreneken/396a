    "summary": "When Earth falls under attack from invincible aliens, no military unit in the world is able to beat them. Maj. William Cage (Tom Cruise), an officer who has never seen combat, is assigned to a suicide mission. Killed within moments, Cage finds himself thrown into a time loop, in which he relives the same brutal fight -- and his death -- over and over again. However, Cage's fighting skills improve with each encore, bringing him and a comrade (Emily Blunt) ever closer to defeating the aliens.",

            "content": "Scintillatingly boring. The intention, in fact, is to to have the main characters relive over and over and over nearly identical events as they struggle against all knowing aliens who, almost inevitably, look like enormous spiders, ones that always know the heroes are coming. However, the tedious repetition that is unintentional is even more dull. Yeah, Tom as always, is excellent as is Emily and the supporting cast. But reduced to a comic book tedium, my most exciting moment was to know, yes, it's over \u2014not the aliens but the film. That so many critics who are supposedly professional can be dazzled by this astounds.",

Sure you may say the movie takes place in a different universe with different rules and such but that's clearly not what the writer and director's intent was. It's clear the story was attempting to model our real world as closely as possible. And for good reason because with their world very similar to our real world the viewer can relate better which will likely induce more fear. However, there were some cliches that just weren't realistic. Additionally not everything made sense and if I actually cared I'm sure I could think of a couple plot holes. CGI looked very off at times and some scenes were incredibly choppy. The second half was much better than the first. At the beginning I thought the relived scenes would get annoying and repetitive, but they were done well and was one of the best aspects of the movie. There were funny moments, and the concept is fantastic, but it could have been much better. Luckily Emily Blunt is a baddie so an additional half a star just for her.",

Was like watching it in the IMAX theatre.\nDoug Liman is a genius. He can be an auteur but he hasn't realized his potential mostly because the auteur is dead; the only auteurs left are the ones left over from the 1990's. Liman obviously was inspired by a lot of science fiction movies from the 50's. And to this inspiration he brings dazzling special effects. I can hardly think of a movie that looks better than this one; perhaps the only one that comes to mind is Cameron's Avatar. \nAt the end of the day though this movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that works in its favor because it knows what it is; which is, pretty much, a fun blockbuster to be released during the summer. In this respect this movie earns 5 full stars because it knows what it is and it excels and even sometimes breaks ground. \nI'd go so far to say that this movie could be rereleased and rediscovered years from now. I hope that everyone that dabbles in Virtual Reality will give this movie a shot on their VR. Really is a good time in 3D with the sound all the way up.",

Tom Cruise and his fellow soldiers battle vile, multi-tentacled attackers while flaunting some weird body armour. These aliens have the power to manipulate time, yet certain people have the capacity to restart their days after dying and return to where they were before, much like a computer game player. or something comparable. They need to find an alien brain that is buried beneath the Louvre Museum in an aquifer. Anyhow, in the end",

Yes, she kicks his butt. This is by far and away my favorite film of her and a glimpse as to what it would be like had she wanted to be an action star. Both Cruise and Blunt play roles they are not used to and come up with excellent performances. RIP also to Bill Paxton who added humor with his lovable accent in his role.\n\nThis, to put it simply, is a must see and one of the most underrated films ever made. It is a tragedy and crime it did so poorly at the box office especially in the US. Appreciate the action, the dialogue and the emotion. Yes, it's all here.",

Edge of tomorrow is also supported by a fantastic cast with all-round fantastic performances; Emily Blunt is incredibly compelling in her role as the ultimate soldier, and she gives a an amazing performance as the stoic Rita Vrataski, only being rivaled by the leading man himself: Tom Cruise. The best part of this movie is William Cage\u2018s arc (Cruise), he begins as a selfish and cowardly PR man, and through the events of the movie, we see him literally transform into a totally different person, forged by \"the fire of the crucible\" into a battle-hardened hero.

            "content": "This film is criminally underrated and I can't understand why; it's directed by Doug Liman and stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt and it is groundhog day meets an alien war, all of the ingredients for success are utilized in this film, and I think that it is one of the most original and thrilling action movies of this decade. Tom Cruise is playing a cowardly officer who tries to go AWOL when he is asked to lead troops onto the battlefield, I loved seeing this change of pace for Cruise who plays an incredibly athletic superhero-type character, you can see the fear in his eyes and you know that he fears death more than anything, I really bought into his character and loved seeing him develop his courage to do what is necessary to save as many lives as possible, it was a clear yet satisfying arc. Emily Blunt gives the best performance in her career as a super bad-ass chick who has been battling alien invaders from space, and she is such a good supporting character, she helps to build up and develop Cruise, she contributes to the plot and should empower women with her awesome fighting skills, and I genuinely cared about what happened to her, I was so pleasantly surprised by how good out two main leads were in this film and would love to see them together again. Brendan Gleeson is also a very underrated actor who performs very well in this film, he isn't in it all that much, but his character served a purpose to the story and I just really like his screen presence. I love seeing Bill Paxton as a rude officer who makes jokes and calls people names, that is the perfect role for him and he produces more laughs than anyone else, RIP Bill Paxton, I would've loved to see him in a sequel. You would think that someone living throughout a day and then dying and living through that day again would get very old very fast, but every time they change something a little bit to keep it interesting, and for the most part, it always was, I loved how they explored this concept of coming back to life when you die and would love to see more of it in a sequel. Doug Liman is such a good director, he knows how to helm great action sequences with CGI blended throughout, the aliens in this film look awesome, and they are very worthy foes for our main characters, I think that this rivals the Bourne Identity as his best film, he really struck gold with this one and I am dying to see a sequel to this film. I implore you to watch this film, no one saw it when it came out and no one is talking about it, It is in my top 5 action movies of the 2010s and I am still waiting for a long-overdue sequel.",

Secondly, believe that humans can understand this, remember multiple world-lines they have lived in, and they can use this time-warped knowledge to fight aforesaid aliens. Got that? Good.\nThat said, Cruise does a great job in this action packed, special effects thrill ride, and head-spinning plot. Highly recommended rental or DVD to own. I rented this as critics said it was a must- see sci-fi movie. They were right.\nSPOILER: We defeat the aliens in this movie's concluding world-line. But oddly enough though Cruise dies yet again doing such, he reappears alive only to look up and find the movie's heroine to get to know her all over again without aliens interfering. So the ending is a tad confusing. How did our hero survive death in the world-line where the time-warping alien entity was already blown to bits? Did Cruise really die as he lay in the organism's blood and guts? Did the near-dead Cruise somehow gain a final time warp? Who knows? Who cares really? It's sci-fi at its best.",

Acting, as expected is good with Cruise doing what he does so well- run, jump, smile, kick, punch. Emily Blunt is a great actress and brings a freshness to the role of the lead female. The special effects aren't heavy, but they are used well and assist the story instead of the other way around. Doug Liman is an exciting director and boy does he bring his best to Edge of Tomorrow. If you like action or sci-fi movies than this is a must watch. ",

            "content": "What a way to end a semester of good science fiction by watching Edge of Tomorrow. I remember seeing the trailer for this film during a Godzilla IMAX 3D screening, thinking it looked too much like a video game and that it looked so cliche. I didn't grasp the fact that it was like Groundhog Day meets Terminator, and the result was a great deal of fun.\n\nFirst of all, this film has a good casting of leads/important characters, such as Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt (who I had not seen much of before this film) and Brendan Gleeson (who I LOVE in In Bruges). Some people hate Tom Cruise, and to that I say give the guy a chance with great roles under his belt such as the lead in Rain Man and a role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia which rightfully earned him an Oscar nomination. Emily Blunt is amazing as the \"full metal b****\" who does not give a damn, knocking out a soldier who nearly calls her by this name. And as for Gleeson, I guess he doesn't really do much, but I like him.\n\nGoing back to Tom Cruise, he plays an iconic spokesperson who has a high military rank, though he is more involved with advertising and wants little to do with actual battle. He is a coward who is sent on a journey to prove himself to be a very brave soldier.\n\nThe Groundhog Day aspect to this film provides a lot of laughs, focusing on funny ways that he dies early in the film and the way Emily Blunt's character kills him over and over again.\n\nThe premise of the film is kind of a stretch to believe, but then again this is science fiction; you either buy it or you don't. Cage is lucky enough to kill an \"Alpha\" with a claymore before dying, and the alpha's blood is splattered onto him and gives him the \"ability\" to reset the day as he dies. These aliens are unlike any we have seen before in alien invasion movies, looking like giant sea creatures with a type of \"hair\" that looks like the features of an anemone. Alphas are very rare amongst them, which are the ones that can reset the day, and their motivations are unknown, but they are a force that the world is fighting against. This is a very \"us vs them\" film promoting global unity to fight a threat.\n\nYou'll be pleasantly surprised with this gem; watch this film.\n\n8/10\n\n*This review is from 2015.",

I saw it in theaters in 2014, and didn't know about the manga it was based on at that time.  \n  \nWell it's 2019 and Alita's been widely aclaimed as one of (if not THE) best anime/manga adaptation to date. Well I remembered liked Edge of Tomorrow back in the day, so I just read the manga and bought and re-watched the movie. I'd say Alita is certainly the better adaptation, while LDE: The Edge of Tomorrow is just a good movie that is based on a manga. It's too different to be considered an adaptation, and it's two different names only further clarifies that. \n\nWhile I do fall into the typical circumstance of enjoying the source material more, it doesn't affect my view of this movie (because it doesn't claim to be the same title or anything). I think this movie and it's screenplay really made the story/concept it's own, which was quite accessible while being very niche at the same time.  \n  \nThe baddies have a cooler design in this movie too.",

            "content": "What a fantastic film! I went to see this with some friends expecting a \"typical action film\" (just something to pass the time) and we all left the theater saying \"wow, that was WAY better than I thought it was going to be!\" By the second time I watched the film I realized that I loved it.\n\nFirst, the characters. Blunt is clearly the highlight of the film here--every scene she's in and every expression she makes is incredible, she acts out her character fantastically and you get the sense of the story she must have gone through without the film having to spell it out for you. Cruse also does well and the film gives his character a very drastic (while also believable) character arc. You see his highs and lows, moments of avoidance, moments of acceptance, and mostly just moments of sheer trying things over and over again until he finds a solution that works. But the film does this in a PROGRESSIONAL manner--rather than seeing the character go through his days sequentially and chronologically as some time-travel films do this movie wisely assumes the audience understands the general concept and chooses to skip the repetition entirely. The film is constantly pushing forward so you're seeing new things--we still see the characters struggle and fail, but you see it more on their faces and through their skill in combat more than the film having to show you every single second of every single reset. Sometimes it even uses the resets to comedic effect, it's all quite cleverly done!\n\nAs for worldbuilding, the alien design is fantastic. It's so organic and mechanical, threatening but sentient. It's a great design and a nice change of pace from more humanoid or simply \"monster\"-like aliens. You can clearly see how they're a threat but instead of just being \"monsters\" you also get the sense that they think and understand, which only makes them even more dangerous to humanity. The mechanic of how the time shifts happen, too, is quite clever (if a bit lucky for our protagonists), and serves the plot well. \n\nWhen it comes to practical effects there's so many explosions and fire and cool looking scenes but the characters pull of the \"look\" of those giant mecha suits quite well. I can't help but assume that must have been a practical effect because it LOOKS good. The heaviness to the suits, the giant helicopter blade sword... no dated CGI here, almost every frame of the movie feels real (minus maybe that Louvre run) and it'll hold up great over time.\n\nI'm kind of gushing at this point, I suppose, but this is probably the best action focused film I've ever seen, I've rewatched it many many times and I'll continue to rewatch it many times going forward. Good character arcs, great alien designs, wonderful practical effects, all woven into an interesting story and concept.",

            "content": "The edge of tomorrow is an action-packed movie that is not only entertaining, but it also contains some important themes. One of the apparent themes throughout the movie is choice. Our story follows Major William Cage, who commissioned to serve in the fight for all humanity against what seems to be unbeatable odds. The whole human existence is on the brink of extinction when a species of aliens is hell bent on taking over the world. In the fight for his life, William Cage is infected with the blood of a rare type of this alien species, also known as the alpha. This is significant to the plot because the blood of this creature has caused him to be able to start the day repeatedly, but only after he has died. The theme of choice is clear in the fact that he could do anything else with his days, yet he still chooses to fight on and attempt to stop annihilation. He is the world's only hope, because of the aliens' intelligence they can adapt to each move the humans make and are able to remember every tactic once the day is restarted. But William is not alone, he is accompanied Sergeant Rita Vrataski. She is a ruthless soldier out to save humanity as well. It comes to a point in the movie where it seems that there is no more hope. He has tried everything throughout all the times he has repeated the day. It appears Rita was the one holding him back, and he learns that he must go on alone if he wants to complete the mission. His love for his partner is the one thing that is keeping him back from saving humanity. Coming to their wits end they cannot come up with a plan to overcome what seems to be impossible. In the end he loses this power to restart the day and he finally realizes that this isn't a game anymore. The lives of the ones he loves and even his own are at stake. He swallows his pride and finally realizes that he needs to lead his team into the belly of the beast if they are going to win and save humanity. So, after many loses and coming face to face with defeat he finally does it. Him and his partner survive, and they save mankind. All is well, the day starts over, and the aliens are all taken care of. \n\nThe moral of the story was that he had to choose to survive, and that he had to sacrifice to make it through each recurrence. William had to learn from every mistake that led up to his death, and in the end, he had to overcome his faults. I agree with the moral of this movie, we all must make decisions for ourselves and we must make sacrifices for the betterment of others. Thinking of others above ourselves is a great practice we must all learn at some point in our lives. In the end of the movie William realizes that he cannot achieve success by himself. In the same way we cannot enter heaven with the blood of Jesus Christ. Every time we try to be perfect on our own we ultimately fail, until we submit ourselves. In the movie we see evil being condemned. The heroes are fighting against what is tearing down their world, not joining it. They fight to restore balance and life to a world that is breaking down amid chaos. The edge of tomorrow shows allot of similarities to that of Buddhism. William Cage must relive repeatedly, suffering each day, until he is finally released when he finds the thing binding him to this recurrence. I do not think this agrees with the bible, because it seems like it relates to the idea of samsara and nirvana, how it teaches that life is suffering and can only be escaped when we reach enlightenment. If anything, Christianity is shown through the setting of the movie. There is chaos that is ravaging the world in which we cannot fight on our own. Although there is allot going on they put on an entertaining show, which is a key point to movies. To be honest I do not have anything bad to say about this movie. It was an interesting movie, and I would recommend it to those who are above 13 and enjoy watching action movies.",

The one thing that is noticeably innovative is it's view of an alien takeover with aliens not having any conscious, individualistic quality but rather as chaotic beings meant solely for death and destruction as headed by a hidden, central source with ambiguous motives.

The action scenes, story, progression were all top notch. I also loved the development of the main character from zero to wimp to slightly better, to bad ass, to broken, back to bad ass. I also thought the romance in this movie was done well, not over the top to take away from the story but a welcome addition to making the character and their relationship feel human. Especially during his broken parts where he's relived the same day over and over and tries to save her. The ending was well done while raising the stakes as it was his last life. It didn't feel like a deus machina and I'm glad it was all resolved well. I just wished I got to see more of Emily Blunt and Tom cruise and their interaction towards the end.

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, I would say  let s review this movie  but I m pretty sure we ve done it already.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It s deja-vu all over again. Let s recap Tom Cruise s new film Edge of Tomorrow.\n\nSCOTT: We meet Major William Cage (Tom Cruise), the spokesperson for the United Defense Forces, a combined military force that is attempting to repel an extraterrestrial invasion by a species known as the Mimics. Cage is sent to General Brigham s office and is surprised when Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders him to participate as a soldier in a wide scale invasion of Mimic-occupied France. When Cage resists and attempts to blackmail Brigham, the General has him arrested and sent to an English base as a private about to be deployed to France.\n\nGREG: Cage is outfitted with a mechanical exoskeleton and lifts off in a heli-transport with his new troop of soldiers bound for a D-Day sort of invasion. They crash land and are met with overwhelming forces - as if the Mimic enemy knew they were coming. Cage is all thumbs with his new gear and is quickly killed in combat. He then immediately wakes up back at the base where he was shanghaied and relives the experience of meeting the soldiers, flying into battle, crashing, and getting killed. On his third incarnation, he meets up with Rita (Emily Blunt) - a soldier who is well-known as the fiercest of the Army s warriors. He relates his experiences to her and she tells him to find her when he wakes up. When he wakes up at the beginning of his day again, he seeks out Rita and relates his experiences to her. Much to his surprise, she believes him. She relates that she herself had been infected with the ability to  reset the day  but had lost it.  Rita tells him that he must go into training to help them find the  Omega  alien who, once killed, will destroy the enemy and save the Earth.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I have a confession to make. I m a sucker for time travel movies, especially ones that are smartly made and contain all the elements of a good hero story. One of my criticisms of previous Tom Cruise movies has been that his characters rarely show any change or growth. Because Edge of Tomorrow is one of those repeating time-loop movies, much like Groundhog Day, William Cage absolutely must change in order to break the temporal cycle. So we re given a satisfying story of personal growth that redeems not only the character but saves the world as well. Cage starts out a coward and a fool. We don t like him very much, and when we learn that he is squeamish it doesn t seem likely he can survive countless blood-soaked battles with the Mimics. Dire circumstances, however, gradually transform Cage into an invincible warrior. What we have is a dark Groundhog Day on steroids, a film that works on many different levels, including the all-important emotional level.\n\nGREG: Scott, I m glad you mentioned Groundhog Day because that is the criticism I have of Edge of Tomorrow. It takes the central idea of Bill Murray s film and applies it to war. Since Groundhog Day is such a well-known film, the filmmakers must offer something above and beyond what we already know must happen. We already know that the hero will recycle through his life experiences and learn and relearn lessons until he becomes proficient. Edge does offer one new thread which is the ability for the hero to lose the gift of time travel. However, once this fact is mentioned in the story, you know there has to come a point in the film where the hero must lose the power. It made Edge rather predictable. I ll agree with you on Cage s growth in this film. He starts out as a wimp and a coward and when he finds himself in the predicament of reliving his life over again daily. We see him become a better man. He comes to care for his platoon-mates and falls in love with Rita, the beautiful war veteran. By the end of the film we are treated to a redefined man, one we hardly recognize.\n\nSCOTT: Another difference between this film and Groundhog Day centers on what has to happen for the hero to escape from the time loop. Bill Murray s character has to become a good man, but Tom Cruise s character must do more than just change his nature; he must also destroy the Omega. In both Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, a woman is the central instrument of the man s change. I think it s no coincidence that the woman s name is Rita in both movies. The villains in Edge of Tomorrow -- the Mimics -- are somewhat novel in both their appearance and in their behavioral characteristics. The creatures are a strange spider-reptile hybrid that moves at hyper-speed. They also have the ability to use time travel to anticipate their enemy s next moves. The Mimics are also disappointing in some ways, and I ll let you, Greg, describe why this is the case.\n\nGREG: Thanks, Scott. Apparently the Mimics suffer the same malady that aliens from across time and space suffer from - that of being controlled by a singular, central mind. When Cage destroys the  Omega  beast, all the  Alpha  and  Drone  aliens also stop working. This is a tired plot device that we ve seen in such movies as Independence Day, Divergent, RoboCop, and Transcendence, just to name a few.\n\nSCOTT: Edge of Tomorrow recycles a few old ideas but offers two rock-solid hours of fun and adventure. Tom Cruise turns in one of his best performances in years here, and for a refreshing change he plays a character who evolves throughout the course of the film. Because the movie is very well done and because I love sci-fi stories that utilize time travel effectively, I m happy to award Edge of Tomorrow 4 Reels out of 5. The hero story in this film is appealing on several levels. Cage embarks on a dangerous journey in an unfamiliar world, and to achieve his mission he must undergo a transformation that is satisfying to watch. We re treated to several key features of the hero s journey, such as Cages encounter with Rita, a remarkably strong female character who plays a mentoring role in helping Cage discover his missing inner quality. Rita is the key to Cages redemption and also steals his heart. In my view William Cage is a worthy hero who deserves a rating of 4 out of 5 Heroes. As you point out, Greg, the two formidable forces that Cage must overcome are the Mimics and his own weakness of character. There are also a few other oppositional characters who get in Cage s way, such as General Brigham and Sergeant Farrell. Pardon the pun, but the Mimics unfortunately do mimic prior sci-fi extra-terrestrials. But the good news is that the Mimics also have a unique look and intriguing time-shifting abilities. Overall, the villainous components of this movie are used to great effect, leading me to conclude that Edge of Tomorrow deserves a strong rating of 4 Villains out of 5. Movie: Villains: Heroes:\n\nGREG: I really hate to say this, but I didn t have the same impression of this movie as you did, Scott. The graphics and battle scenes are definitely worth the price of admission. But Edge of Tomorrow borrowed so many plot devices from other movies that I can only give it 3 out of 5 Reels. Cage as the hero undergoes a good transformation which is gradual and believable (in the context of the sci/fi elements). But we ve seen this done before exceedingly well in Groundhog Day. One redeeming element that I found in Edge of Tomorrow was Emily Blunt as a completely believable female warrior. We don t see that everyday. Still, I can only give Tom Cruise s character 3 out of 5 Heroes. Finally, we re so far apart on the villains here. The Mimics are such a retread from other movies and have so little to offer other than being evil, mindless, bad guys that I can t give them such a lofty score as you did. I ll grant you that there are other oppositional forces in play, but in my mind, it s the Mimics who are the main villains and they simply don t measure up to other fine villains we ve seen this year (witness The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and X-Men: Days of Future Past). I give the Mimics just 1 Villain out of 5. Movie: Villains: Heroes:",

A premise like this may sound like some sort of weird B-rated fan film, but Edge of Tomorrow, or All You Need Is Kill, or Live Die Repeat, whatever you wanna call it, is an incredibly enjoyable action film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It reminded me of a video game in many aspects which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The way Tom Cruise's character constantly died over and over to the same aliens while slowly figuring out what to do and how to do it to advance further and further in the plot reminded me a lot of retro rouge-lite titles like Ninja Gaiden or like modern titles like Dark Souls. The characters of the movie aren't really as fleshed out as I'd like them to be, the most fleshed of the characters was Emily Blunt's character and even that is only given through small bits and pieces. It's enough for me to not care about the eventual forced romance and for me to care less about the fate of the other side characters, but it is not enough to drag the film down too low. The action, creative idea, brilliant execution, and interesting alien designs help push this movie up as one of the most creative action movies in recent years.",

And unlike so many summer action movies, it actually has a plot and a fascinating one at that.\n\nIt is difficult to talk about the plot of the film without giving too much away, but suffice it to say that humans are at war with invading aliens and somehow Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is forced to relive the same day over and over again. It is Groundhog Day meets an alien war and it works incredibly well. The only fear with this kind of plot is the redundancy of repetition. Fortunately, this film does not have that issue, any scenes that \"repeat\" are different enough that they remain interesting. The war genre, especially war with aliens, opens up the plot to delve deeply into many subjects regarding life, humanity, war, etc. While Edge of Twilight does not delve very deeply into the philosophical themes, it does enough to avoid the tag of \"shallow action movie\" and also doesn't spread itself too thin as to convolute the plot.\n\nTom Cruise puts on a great performance ranging from a charming smile to bouts of distraught rage. The only other character of note is another soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blount).  It is refreshing to see a strong female character in a leadish role - Rita isn't just there to be eye-candy. She a strong fighter, strong-willed, intelligent, and has deep emotions. There are several other minor characters. While the supporting cast is comprised of individuals instead of some generic cookie-cutter characters, they don't get that much screen time; this film is really a two character affair and the two characters are strong enough to carry the film.\n\nIf there is an alien war, it'd be nice to have some action and Edge of Tomorrow defiantly delivers on that front. The first battle scene is especially memorable; quick-cuts, the use of sound, and explosions going off everywhere create a sense of a brutal, chaotic battlefield. It's no surprise consider the director, Doug Liman, also directed the action packed The Bourne Identity. There is plenty of action throughout the entire film. The most surprising aspect was how funny the movie is overall. There are plenty of funny one-liners and physical comedy. What the film does best is to use the repetition aspect of the plot to create some very funny moments throughout the film. Of course this is not a comedy movie and it does get serious and tragic as well.\n\nThe only real issue I had with the film is the ending. It is a satisfying ending on its own, but there was a huge missed opportunity to have an incredible ending. I won't go into detail as to what that is exactly, but I thought I should say something negative-ish about the film as well, but fortunately there really isn't much to say on that front.",

            "content": "In past reviews, I've discussed how the world of cinema has been doling out some pretty decent horror movies lately.  That's certainly true, but the sci-fi genre has also very quietly been churning out some real gems in recent years.  \"Inception.\"  \"Source Code.\"  \"Looper.\"  \"Cloud Atlas.\"  \"Oblivion.\"  \"Predestination.\"  \"Transcendence.\"  Any one of those titles would make for some great, intelligent viewing for those who like a little bit of futuristic depth with their stories.\n\n\nYou could also add Doug Liman's \"Edge of Tomorrow\" to that list.  (Incidentally, this movie came out in 2014, the same year as \"Transcendence\" as \"Predestination.\"  This was a particularly good year for the genre.)  Combining elements of the aforementioned films \"Looper\" and \"Source Code\" as well as a dash of 2001's \"Minority Report,\" \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is a perfect example of a film taking some overly familiar elements and doing some very fun things with it.  It's composed of pieces of several other recent sci-fi adventures and has one of the most derivative underlying stories you could imagine, and yet its gimmick makes it seem fresh, unique and highly entertaining.\n\n\nAnd its gimmick?  Why, a \"Groundhog Day\" style time-loop, of course.  Every time soldier William Cage (Tom Cruise) is killed in battle, he somehow wakes up back at the beginning of the same day...before the battle has begun.  It's almost like a stage of a video game; get yourself killed, you simply lose a life and try again.  Trial and error.  (Thankfully our hero appears to have an infinite amount of lives.)\n\nThe battle in question is with a slimy band of tentacled, multi-limbed invading aliens.  Code-named \"mimics\" due to their ability to learn from and ape their enemies' tactics--in this case, mankind--these nasty critters have world domination on the agenda.  To combat them, our world's militaries have devised powerful exoskeleton suits that enhance a soldier's strength, speed, and reflexes.  (Kind of like the suit Matt Damon gets equipped with in \"Elysium.\"  Hey, there's another influence, and another good recent sci-fi flick!)\n\nCage's unique situation would seem to give him an edge as he knows what's coming before it occurs.  However, every time he \"dies,\" he has to start from scratch, and it means exploring every possible angle and scenario to try and alter the outcome.  And when he encounters a fellow soldier (Emily Blunt) that's previously experienced this same phenomenon, he learns that the stakes are even higher than he initially believed.\n\nThe screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth (based on a novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka) is clever and twisty, and it's also chock full of some wickedly dark humor.  Cage finds himself at Death's door A LOT, and there are echoes of the TV show \"Supernatural's\" great third season episode \"Mystery Spot\"; in theory, a character dying over and over again shouldn't be funny--save for maybe Kenny on \"South Park\"--but it certainly can be.  Sometimes it's the method in which he's killed, sometimes it's just the fact that it happens so damn often.  And sometimes there's just a throwaway line of dialogue that had me chuckling.\n\nThe aliens themselves are nasty and intimidating, but they aren't really anything special visually.  But that didn't matter to me as I was deeply invested in the story and the characters.  It didn't matter who or what the aliens were.  They were the enemy; that was all they had to be.  And Liman (\"The Bourne Identity,\" \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\") stages the action sequences with skill and competence.\n\nWith \"Minority Report,\" \"Oblivion,\" and now this, Tom Cruise has started to carve out a nice niche for himself in the sci-fi action genre.  (Even the \"War of the Worlds\" remake had its moments.)  I particularly liked his role this time around as it seemed so different from other Tom Cruise roles.  At the onset of the movie, Cage is a frightened neophyte, a reluctant soldier forced into combat when he'd rather literally be doing anything else.  There's no trace of Cruise's normal \"hero mode\" here, and it was a change of pace to see him act a little...well, cowardly.  It takes dying a few--and by a few, I mean \"a lot\"--times for Cage to find his resolve.\n\nBlunt is also great as the tough-as-nails soldier who won't take shit from anybody, Cage included.  Some of her best moments occur when she's toughening up the wormy rookie...and sometimes that even means literally killing him!  You'll have to see the movie to get it.\n\nThe supporting cast is made up of reliable character actors like Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson, and Noah Taylor.  All are superb, leaving memorable imprints on roles that are, at their heart, rather cliched.\n\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is a fantastic movie, thrilling, funny, and engaging.  It's a near-perfect example of taking overused subject matter (who would've thought that we really needed another hostile-alien-from-outer-space movie?) and making it interesting again.  If I've said it once, I've said a thousand times: it's all about execution...particularly when your main character is himself getting executed over and over and over again.",

The movie explains why Cruise's character William Cage is stuck in a time loop, although it doesn't make much sense. Once you accept the premise, though, it's a fun ride.\n\nAt first, Cage tries to change the course of the battle he must continually repeat. When that doesn't work, he tries to avoid it altogether. But he ends up dying anyway when the aliens conquer Earth, only to wake up a day before the final battle yet again. Slowly, with the help of one other soldier (Emily Blunt) who has had a similar experience, Cage realizes he must defeat the aliens to escape the time loop. With each loop, Cage becomes a better soldier, slowly gaining more ground each time he goes into battle.\n\nThe training scenes, where Cage dies over and over and comes back to try again, are quite funny. Things get a bit more serious when the heroes finally have a plan to defeat the aliens. I won't reveal too much, but why is it that so many movie aliens are hive creatures under the control of a central queen? The production values are solid and the effects are great. Cruise, for all the weirdness of his off-screen life, is still a very watchable actor. And in the final scene of the whole movie, Cruise says nothing, but gives a look that reminds you he's also a very, very good actor.\n\nIt's just too bad there wasn't a way to drop Bill Murray into this somewhere.",

Nur noch eine letzte Bastion der Menschheit steht ihnen bevor.\nSchon lustig, diese Aliens sind Mimics. Aber ich hatte noch keine Mimik an ihnen entdeckt. Auch die letzte Schlacht spielt sich an der franz\u00f6sische K\u00fcste ab. Ironischerweise wird das der D-Day in der Zukunft sein.\nDer hochdekorierte Kriegsreporter William Cage wird an die Front gezwungen und durch einen Zwischenfall, muss er den Tag immer und immer wieder wiederholen. Bis er selber zu einer L\u00f6sung kommt.\nDiese Idee finde ich noch originell. Sicherlich hatte es fr\u00fcher auch geklappt mit der Kom\u00f6die Und t\u00e4glich gr\u00fcsst das Murmeltier\". Aber jetzt den Schauplatz in die Zukunft zu verlegen und immer wieder zu sterben, ist ein guter Ansatz.\nTom Cruise spielt seinen Soldaten Cage gut. Am Anfang v\u00f6llig verunsichert, wird er immer besser, nach so vielen Toden. Sein Gegenst\u00fcck ist Emily Blunt. Blunt ist schon ein Veteran unter den Alien Kriegen und steht ihren Mann.\nDie Regie \u00fcbernahm Doug Liman. Liman hatte ein paar Jahre fr\u00fcher die Bourne Reihe ins Leben gerufen. Seitdem hatte er nicht wirklich gute Arbeit abgegeben. Doch dieser Film, hatte er virtuos und stilsicher umgesetzt.\nDie erste H\u00e4lfte ist schnell und gnadenlos. Unz\u00e4hlige Tode muss Cruise miterleben. Es geht v\u00f6llig turbulent zu. Selten kommt eine Verschnaufpause f\u00fcr den Zuschauer. Ab der zweiten H\u00e4lfte wird die Geschichte leider dann verw\u00e4ssert. Es gibt auch dann mehrere Logikl\u00f6cher. Leider ist auch der Schluss viel zu einfach.\nFazit: Eine gut inszenierte Geschichte und mit dieser Zeitschleife, eine gute Idee. Das h\u00e4tte man locker bis ans Ende gesehen!",

The theological departure of this alien from of a mere conventional destruction force is that parasitical, cancerous relationship that feeds on human's own natural instincts. This is a force of Evil, instead of the force of an enemy such as that in the \"Independence Day\". The problem of Evil is always far more interesting that of the mere opposing Foe.  That is why Star War, Lords of The Rings are far more interesting than Star Trek or Harry Potter. \n\nThe central character is William Cage, a shallow smart-ass who does the publicity for the defending earth army.  A strange sequence of unfortunate event sent him into a perpetual limbo of eternal returns - waking up as a handcuffed deserter, dying in the messy battle field.  Can he learn with each repeat?  In reverse of the \"Groundhog's Day\", Cage tries to live a bit longer each iteration with the help of Rita who also had such repeats.  \n\nThe fleshy body of this story is an action story with technological hijinks, snappy wit and occasional rather blunt dark humor.  Rita sigh at each failed training session \"now you need to die\" and then shot Cage point blank.  Do over!\n\nYet the heart of this story is a striving for meaning in doing one's duty, better each time.  The old Cage chipped away his smarminess and emerging with credible courage and nobility.",

            "content": "In modern cinema science fiction films can be organised into two categories; those which manage to be thought provoking and interesting, and those which skip on development in favour of mindless action. Edge of Tomorrow, Tom Cruise's latest foray into the genre is thankfully part of the former, with its unique take on futuristic warfare.\n\nLightly inspired by and adapted from Japanese novel \"All you need is kill\" Edge of Tomorrow takes place in the not-too-distant future, where mankind is under attack from a species of extra-terrestrials known as mimics, who have overrun Europe. The combined armies of the United Defence Forces with their advanced military exoskeletons aim to push back with the beaches of France serving as the main frontline. From here we're introduced to Major William Cage (Tom Cruise), a propaganda officer who is thrust into combat with no knowledge of experience of infantry combat whatsoever; Cage is quickly killed by the rampaging monsters, but something is amiss as he wakes up and experiences the same day of brutal combat over and over again. From here, the film loops over sequences and then progresses further as Cage, along with the fabled Seargent Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) to unravel the mystery and outwit the Mimics before it's too late. While the film's repeating of the initial action scene may seem like a waste of run time, the film uses it sparingly to hammer home the strange and baffling situation Cage and Vrataski find themselves in and this technique is wisely cut down to avoid tedium for the later parts of the movie. Over the course of their mission across France and rural Europe, the dynamic duo teams up with an inquisitive scientist (Noah Taylor) and eventually a rag tag squad of soldiers to take on the alien menace. If there's one gripe with the plot, it's that the mimics don't really get a lot of backstory and explanation; the mystery surrounding their hierarchy and the way they fight is well done, but we never learn much about where they came from, or why they are attacking humanity.\n\nOf course a plot this complex wouldn't work too well without solid characters and the cast of Edge of Tomorrow pulls off this feat quite well. It's a welcomed change of pace to see Tom Cruise in a more vulnerable role this time around; rather than the usual tough guy we usually see Cruise play, here he really needs to go through proper development to become the one to stop the Mimics. Emily Blunt as Rita stands as the opposite; a strong-willed and powerful leading lady who assists and trains Cage, rather than the other way around. The relationship between the two is well developed and builds naturally over the course of the film as both characters are distracted from their attachment to each other by the mission at hand, and the grim consequences for failure. In other roles, Bill Paxton as the drill sergeant is surprisingly charismatic, despite the small role he has in the film. Though the other characters aren't as well rounded or developed enough to make you care about their fates, the film nonetheless delivers where it counts in terms of characterization.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow's bombastic action sequences can be very disorienting; whilst the exoskeletons seem cumbersome at first, they quickly come into their own on the battlefields of Europe. During the action, the camera does shake quite frequently but in this case, it adds to the disorientation and visceral nature of the combat. The music matches this mood, with gritty tones and echoing sound effects during the combat, contrasted against more sombre tracks in the film's final moments. In addition to the strong technical presentation, there's also some great looking stunt work from Cruise and Blunt, which heightens the intensity further. The Mimic designs are also quite unique; the creatures seem to be made up of coils and other machinery pulsing with electrical energy; this gives way to some particularly stunning lighting effects in the film's final act. As far as science fiction films go, Edge of Tomorrow does a fine job with its effects, working to absorb the viewer in the fires of battle wherever possible.\n\nAt first glance Edge of Tomorrow seems like another generic science fiction film, but the complexity of the plot made possible by the bending of time really does add some much needed spice to a crowded genre. If you're willing to engage your mind, this is one science fiction war worth plunging into.",

Structured where a single day is in a loop for our time-defying protagonist (performed with wit and charm by Tom Cruise), the obvious comparisons to 1993s Groundhog Day or 2011s Source Code immediately spring to mind. Similar to those films, Liman and his screenwriters have fun with filling their limited time with quirky characters, memorable dialogue queues and exciting (Aliens-esque) action. Most of that is difficult enough to entertain in news ways but the smarts in the story is tied directly to the characters and although we cover a lot of the same ground throughout the two-hour film, it all serves to help our heroes grow. The result is an inspired balance between the adventure of the film (which is great) and the heart-making Edge of Tomorrow that rare action movie that provides the brain and the brawn.",

            "content": "With the exception, maybe, of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, no film has ever so closely replicated what it's like to actually play a video game than Doug Liman's All You Need Is Kill Live/Die/Repeat Edge of Tomorrow. And with the exception of Scott Pilgrim, no film that's either explicity based on a video game or more tangentially based on the idea of video games (like this one) is smarter than Edge of Tomorrow. But in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king, and being one of the smartest video game movies ever made doesn't necessarily make a movie smart.\n\nThe film is basically a riff on Duncan Jones' Source Code but set during an alien invasion. It begins with some exposition: A crusading species has invaded Earth and taken control of most of Europe. For a while, it seemed mankind was fighting back in vain, unable to kill even one of these creatures. But the famous Battle of Verdun changed the tide somewhat and gave humanity a hero in the form of Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who leads mankind in its first victory in this planetary war.\n\nOn the precipice of the next big battle (for London), military PR shill Bill Cage (Tom Cruise) is thrown to the wolves by his commanding officer. He's heading to the front line and killed just minutes after figuring out how to turn off the safety on his mechanized suit weapon (think Avatar).\n\nBut wait: Cage is back on a tarmac about to be verbally accosted by his platoon's leader...again. Now he's back on his transport vehicle. Back in battle. Dead again. Alive again. What???\n\nThe reason behind this morbid Groundhog Day doesn't make very much sense, but thankfully, neither Liman nor the film's screenwriting team (Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth) dwells on it too much. Edge of Tomorrow isn't concerned with the why, but rather what Cage and Vrataski do with all that time. It's not a deal-breaker necessarily-the way it just plows through reason. But the fact that it does so in a way that virtually eliminates the film's stakes for the majority of the running time is something no screenplay could recover from.\n\nWhen I say the film replicates the experience of playing a video game, it's because of this premise. Work toward a goal, make a mistake, lose a life, start back at the beginning. It's Super Mario Brothers: Invasion. Occasionally, you'll encounter a boss or hit a checkpoint of sorts, but you'll play the level again and again, finding patterns that advance you further each time. Again, it's interesting to see a talented filmmaker like Liman and stars like Blunt (who's great) and Cruise (who's fine) attempt to mine this material and this style of storytelling for something meaningful, but it's fool's gold they dig up-mindless engery cinema.\n\nAll that said, it's not a boring film to watch. There's solid chemistry between Cruise and Blunt (who has great chemistry with anyone she shares a screen with because she's Emily Blunt and because she's awesome), and there's some clever bits along the way that clue you in to just how many times these characters have performed this exhausting exercise. Edge of Tomorrow might have been more noteworthy if it disposed of the alien thing altogether and asked its characters to solve a mystery or even something hilariously innocuous like a jigsaw puzzle, but big and loud is a business imperative. So this is the film we have, and while it doesn't live up to its potential, it's nevertheless better than most of its ilk. A perfectly watchable, wildly imperfect movie.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/edge-of-tomorrow-review/",

Listen, whatever its title is its a great film.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow tells the story of Major William Cage (Tom Cruise), a public affairs officer who, although he works for the military, doesn't have any combat experience himself. The human race has been at war for a number of years with an alien race known as Mimics. The humans are heavily down on their luck and are failing in their attempts to overcome the Mimics. When plans are put forward to Cage and he declines to participate, he is arrested. Whilst trying to escape, he is knocked out. When he awakes he finds himself at Heathrow Airport, still apprehended, with a demotion and a charge of desertion set on him. He is forced into battle...\n\nThis is an action film. An action film starring Tom Cruise. To be honest with just that you can probably decide whether this is for you or not. Edge of Tomorrow understands its action-loving audience and caters to those people; adding a few extras for those who perhaps don't love black-and-white action films. The film gloriously basks in clich\u00e9s and steadily morphs into a great science fiction and (lesser so) war film. Echoing the greatness of older action films; staying afloat in the cesspool of present day Hollywood blockbuster action films. This is dumb action with a little bit more brain, but is by no means a cerebral affair. It is charming in its self recognition, and in that, it becomes a very entertaining film. Serving a plateful of action with cutlery of fire. Even the most critical minds cannot deny that this is fun, and that is really all you need from an action film. The thing is that this film gives you more. The core plot point is something we have seen before. It is used here in a clever way though, as it directly connects to the sentiments of video-games. This isn't just a gimmick. Watching the main character slowly realize his situation, with the help of Sergeant Rita Rose Vrataski (Emily Blunt), makes for an all the more interesting watch. Once you accept that this film and its concepts may or may not be feasible it becomes even more enjoyable. Nobody is saying that this film is a classic. Not even of the action genre. It is great though. That's all you need sometimes.\n\nTo talk about some of the weaker aspects of this film. This film is very much about Cruise's character. There perhaps could have been some more fleshing out of surrounding characters. Many of the characters are run of the mill, stereotypical film characters, and that's a shame. There is a specific sequence where the film tries to give you more about Blunt's character, but in the end it makes the film unnecessarily stagnant. This is the same for the setting of the film.. We are told hardly anything about this future world that has been ravished by aliens and the circumstances surrounding the situation. That story could be a worthwhile prequel, for once. The truth is, this didn't really need to be a heavily sci-fi film. The sci-fi points of the film are actually the weakest parts of the film. Simply because I feel nothing for this world and most of the people on it, apart from the two leads. Nothing in this film detracts from the final product too much though. CGI that glitches every now and then can slightly pull one out of the experience, but those moments become \"oh well\"s in an otherwise well-made and matte-flourished, however clich\u00e9d, future world.\n\nCasting Tom Cruise in an action film sets the filmmakers on the right track. With the Mission: Impossible series of films behind him, he has established himself as one of the front runners for a great action performance. The fact that Tom Cruise is also a great dramatic actor is useful in this film. He is never over-the-top, which is something some others struggle to deal with in action films. His comedic chirps are also on view here, which simply put the icing on an already delicious cake. Full-blooded and well-rounded, Tom Cruise makes this film all the more worth watching. Cruise's co-star Emily Blunt also exhibits herself as a player in the action field. Something I don't think I have seen from her. A rock hard character who won't take the slightest bit of bother from anyone, excellently played by an excellent actress. Blunt parries the comedic lines sent from Cruise in a terrific, deadpan fashion, on many occasions and every now and then slips in her own punchlines in that hard and stony way. She plays the mentor in both the main character's physical training and the mental strains he is under. Both dance formulated and strongly together which only makes the film a deeper pleasure than perhaps it would have been if others had been cast.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow is a solid sci-fi film. Clever when it needs to be and dumb when it is called for; it becomes not just a pacifying, but also an interesting showing. You'll watch this once, twice and maybe a few more times. As mentioned before, this will never be a classic and isn't awfully original, but it is a top-notch film for sitting back and enjoying. A popcorn popper that gives more than it needed to its audience. In my opinion this is one of the best actions films that has been released in recent years. If that is saying much.",

Of course, the closer thing to this movie can be a videogame (play, game over, re-play) but in a nice way (i love videogames and some of them are far better than the average movie around), it's not a \"just  cool visuals\" movie with zero story. This is the third sci-fi movie with Tom Cruise i watch (the other two being War of The Worlds and Oblivion) and i think he is absolutely perfect for these roles, as long as the movie allows him to give some  subtety and human nuance  to the heroes  he plays.",

It's sharp, suspenseful, well-paced, funny, and best of all, Tom's back to being the movie star we once weren't embarrassed to say we liked.\n\nBased on the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill, the plot is War of the Worlds meets Groundhog Day. It tells the story of Major William Cage (Cruise), a military propagandist who encourages people to sign up and join the unwinnable fight against the Mimics - space aliens with dreads of steel - who have taken control of Europe. Cage, a wimp, has absolutely no intention of joining the battle himself and when he refuses a direct order to cover the war from the front lines he is stripped of his rank, branded a deserter, and dumped into the infantry about to join the invasion. He is killed very quickly but then finds himself in a time loop where he is forced to relive the same day over and over. With the help of Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a military heroine who has experienced the same time phenomenon, Cage finds his courage and skills and devises a plan to defeat the alien enemy.\n\nDoug Liman (The Bourne Identity) directs with energy and intellect. The Groundhog aspect of the story could easily have been tedious but it's very cleverly exploited and sustained. Similarly the burgeoning love story could've been a wet, predictable distraction from the main game but it's delicately handled with no whiff of schmalz - again, something we've come to expect of so many of Tom's films. The third act is slightly less impressive than the rest of the film but it does what it has to do and is ultimately forgivable.\n\nScreenwriters Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, editor James Herbert and cinematographer Dion Beebe all deserve high praise.  There really isn't a dull moment in the film. It continues to surprise throughout and it looks fantastic.\n\nCruise is perfect in this role. The smarmy P.R. dude is the Cruise that gives us the creeps and we're not expected to like this character. But as the untrained soldier dropped out of a plane into the thick of a bloody battle, we totally empathise with him; who wouldn't be shit scared? We duck and weave with him through the chaos on the Normandy beach trying to stay alive and when he suffers his gruesome demise it's both shocking and funny. And it is the humour of this piece that keeps it fresh and entertaining.\n\nLiman has also been very canny in casting Emily Blunt opposite Cruise. If Blunt never made another film post The Devil Wears Prada I'd still rate her as a brilliant perceptive performer, but she has gone on to prove again and again that she can sensitively inhabit a character and make it her own and she does that again here. Vrataski is strong without being butch. Vulnerable without being weak. Blunt and Cruise have real chemistry and play off each other well. They're also aided by a fine cast of supports including Aussies Noah Taylor and Kick Gurry, as well as Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson.\n\nDespite very positive reviews, Edge of Tomorrow came in third at the U.S. box office on its opening weekend with a relatively weak $29 million, beaten by teen weepy The Fault In Our Stars ($48 m) and Disney's Maleficent in its second week ($34 m). The Tom Cruise brand has undoubtedly suffered significant damage by jumping on couches, the revelations about his weirdo cult religion and some poor film choices. But whatever you think of the man, Tom Cruise the actor has genuine, rare screen presence. So many young male stars today merely trade on their super hero costume and some CGI effects. But they're not stars in the true sense of the word. Cruise is and Edge of Tomorrow may go some way to bringing some sparkle back to his credibility. I hope so.",

The fast-paced action is balanced with perfect suspense.\n\nJust like in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day, Tom Cruise's character Major William Cage gets to wake up to the same day over and over again. The reason? Humans are fighting an alien species which has a special ability to reset time. This ability is used by the aliens to control the outcome of war. Apparently, they want our planet. \n\nJust before he dies in battle (the first time), Cage is splattered with the blood of a certain type of alien involved in time reset. This transfers the alien's do-over ability to him.\n\nThe survival of the human race is at stake, and every time Cage dies--which is repeatedly-- he gets to try to do it all over again, better. He soon teams up with a superfighter named Rita, who similarly had but lost the ability he now has. She shares what she learned from her own experiences, which gives him an edge.\n\nHow many different ways can you die fighting an alien? Apparently, many. Along the way, Cage gets to know everyone in his circle fairly well, including Rita. He gets to see over and over again, how people as well as aliens react and behave, and he gets better and better at using this knowledge to his advantage.\n\nIf Cage does not succeed, the human race will likely go extinct. He cannot fail. Good thing he gets to keep trying.\n\nIf done right, I would love to see a sequel.",

Una l\u00e1stima que no aparezca Bill Murray, por supuesto. Pero para eso tenemos a Emily Blunt, no se preocupen...\n\nEl Mayor William Cage (Cruise) lleg\u00f3 a los altos rangos del ej\u00e9rcito sin haber nunca disparado una bala. Por eso, cuando el General Brigham (Gleeson) decide ponerlo en medio del campo de batalla en una guerra contra extra-terrestres, \u00e9l desesperadamente trata de zafarse. Sus intentos no funcionan y muere de forma r\u00e1pida en combate. Sin embargo, al morir, Cage despierta nuevamente en el d\u00eda previo al despliegue de las tropas. D\u00eda tras d\u00eda, Cage muere y vuelve a vivir hasta que conoce a Rita (Blunt), hero\u00edna del ej\u00e9rcito quien tambi\u00e9n pose\u00eda esa habilidad. Juntos deben encontrar la manera de utilizar este poder para terminar la invasi\u00f3n y ganar la guerra por la Tierra.\n\nLa pel\u00edcula comienza mostr\u00e1ndonos c\u00f3mo sucedi\u00f3 la invasi\u00f3n alien\u00edgena y cu\u00e1les fueron las repercusiones en un montaje de medios de comunicaci\u00f3n. Luego de esto conocemos al Mayor William Cage quien se re\u00fane con el General Brigham para discutir t\u00e9rminos de cobertura y formalidades con respecto al pr\u00f3ximo despliegue de tropas para el combate, que ser\u00e1 al d\u00eda siguiente. En una inesperada vuelta del destino para Cage, Brigham lo designa a \u00e9l para que cubra la batalla en el mismo campo. Cage se niega rotundamente para luego ser dejado inconsciente y despertando en el regimiento del escuadr\u00f3n. En ese lugar conoce al Sargento Farell (Paxton), quien evita cualquier tipo de compasi\u00f3n por el inexperto soldado y lo pone bajo entrenamiento junto con los dem\u00e1s.\nVer a Cruise en un papel no muy recurrente es refrescante... y muy entretenido. El de un tipo cobarde, que siempre escapa de la confrontaci\u00f3n es un personaje que dif\u00edcilmente vemos en el repertorio del talentoso actor y en \u00e9ste film funciona, agregando exitosamente otro matiz al vers\u00e1til curr\u00edculum del int\u00e9rprete.\nCuando Cage es enviado a la batalla, sin sorpresas, muere al corto tiempo de llegar al campo. Al morir, el tipo despierta en el mismo lugar y momento donde despert\u00f3 cuando fue llevado al regimiento. Confundido, le toma unas cuantas repeticiones para entender lo que sucede. Vive. Muere. Repite. Durante una de sus repeticiones, ve a la alabada hero\u00edna del ej\u00e9rcito, Rita, morir en combate, por lo que la pr\u00f3xima vez la salva. Cuando dice c\u00f3mo la salv\u00f3, ella le dice que la encuentre cuando despierte.\n\nEmily Blunt nos entrega una excelente interpretaci\u00f3n en la Full Metal Bitch, como le dicen en el ej\u00e9rcito. Su actitud de mujer ruda y poderosa entrega una din\u00e1mica activa y evolutiva en su relaci\u00f3n con el personaje de Cruise. Habiendo ella tenido la misma experiencia que Cage, toma las riendas del asunto y entrena al inexperto soldado mientras recibe la informaci\u00f3n del \"futuro\" por parte de \u00e9l.\nDesde el momento en que Cruise y Blunt se ponen sus trajes, la acci\u00f3n no para. Acompa\u00f1ada de excelentes efectos especiales, las escenas de acci\u00f3n son explosi\u00f3n cinem\u00e1tica pura.\nMientras que peque\u00f1os toques de humor adornaban las escenas de repetici\u00f3n de Cage, el peso dram\u00e1tico de la historia invade las escenas de repetici\u00f3n de Cage junto a Rita. Morir m\u00faltiples veces no debe ser agradable. Menos agradable debe ser ver morir a la persona con la que est\u00e1s desarrollando una relaci\u00f3n interpersonal cada d\u00eda.\nDesde el inicio del film, el punto de vista es explorado desde el personaje de Cage. No sabemos por qu\u00e9 es puesto en esa posici\u00f3n y no entendemos al cien por ciento lo que sucede alrededor. Avanzamos y vamos tomando el ritmo de las repeticiones. A medida que se avanza m\u00e1s cuando conocemos a Rita, la edici\u00f3n del film y su paso narrativo no nos indica exactamente cuantas veces Cage ha muerto y repetido.\nEn este momento nuestra mira pasa a Rita, y vemos todo desde su punto de vista. Estamos simplemente siguiendo a Cage porque \u00e9l es quien conoce lo que sucede m\u00e1s adelante.\n\nAmbos logran salir del campo de batalla para emprender camino hacia unas instalaciones que Cage ve en visiones que comienza a tener. Y de acuerdo con lo que le dice Rita, existe la posibilidad de que ese lugar sea la respuesta para ganar la guerra. Por esto, ambos viajan contra los pron\u00f3sticos de Cage y a duras penas logran sobrevivir cada vez.\nCuando se rinden, deciden tomar otro camino y viajan donde el General Brigham y le cuentan lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo y c\u00f3mo pueden salvar vidas mediante la habilidad de Cage. Le cuentan... m\u00faltiples veces. Cuando, obviamente, el General no les cree, son perseguidos y, en un accidente, Cage pierde el poder.\nEl ritmo de la historia cambia, pues ahora la muerte significa el fin del juego para todos. Cage y Rita logran llegar al regimiento y conforman un equipo para llegar al lugar donde creen que se encuentra el objetivo clave para destruir a los alien\u00edgenas.\n\nUno de los puntos fuertes del film es la falta de enfoque en el antagonista. Los alien\u00edgenas no son explorados como parte de los personajes, sino que son s\u00f3lo vistos como la contraparte de los h\u00e9roes. De esta forma se logra una homogenizaci\u00f3n del villano para llegar a un punto clave de la confrontaci\u00f3n entre los protagonistas y el \"enemigo\" que resulta bastante efectiva.\n\nEl film est\u00e1 brillantemente dirigido por Liman, pero la confianza de este se apoya fuertemente en el asombroso gui\u00f3n escrito por Chirstopher McQuarrie, quien ha demostrado impresionantes resultados cada vez que trabaja con Cruise.\nLa fotograf\u00eda del largometraje funciona de forma efectiva y en perfecta sincron\u00eda con los efectos visuales.\nLa qu\u00edmica entre Blunt y Cruise es fant\u00e1stica y provee gran parte del entretenimiento en un film que ya est\u00e1 plagado de genialidad.\n\nBuenas actuaciones. Buena direcci\u00f3n. Buen gui\u00f3n. Buen entretenimiento. Dicho de manera simple: un buen film.",

And for some reason Cruise keeps getting killed, but wakes up and re-lives the day over and over. Something about the invaders being able to control time or something. And each time he learns better how to survive for the next time. \"Oh, there's a bunch of aliens there...next time I'll avoid them...\" He pretty much single-handedly saves the world as a result. Not sure how, since it's just a deliberately intricate and complicated mess of reliving his day over and over, apparently many many times. Which makes you wonder why the aliens allowed him to relive and re-learn how better to destroy them...Personally, I've had enough of Tom Cruise. And I've also had enough of deliberately intricate, over-the-top impossible plots, where one guy ends up saving the world. It's just another futuristic mind-bender, if you like that stuff.",

Or both?) a film that I missed as I didn't thought that its \"Groundhog Day meets Halo\" premise would be effective. Does this film live up to its status? \nIn the future, mankind is at war with an alien species we named \"Mimics\". These aliens are winning the war but mankind is determined to avoid extinction so they lunch a \"Operation Neptune\" of worldly proportions as their last stand. \nThe premise of this film sounds limited for the action genre. As \"Groundhog Day\" proved, the reversed time concept works perfectly for comedic and dramatic possibilities but it takes away any tension in the action genre as you don't fear for the characters, so I has very skeptical but director Doug Liman managed to prove me wrong.  \"Live Die Repeat\" (screw it, I just going to call this film like that as it is a much better name than \"Edge of Tomorrow\") is a excellently mate blockbuster that counts with a simple but engaging premise, one of the most memorable and terrifying alien designs I\u00b4ve ever seen (they look like a mix of Halo\u00b4s Flood with the Sentinels from \"The Matrix\"), impressively shot action sequences, Liman\u00b4s directing manages to make this concept work and to keep you on the edge of your seat, the special effects are beautiful, the comedy is hilarious, it knows exactly what to show and what to omit, the acting is serviceable with the best being Emily Blunt who demonstrates that she can be an action star and Bill Paxton who takes completely advantage of its little screen time, there are actually believable stakes that are masterfully executed, a smart editing that knows when to go for comedy and when to move the plot forward, and it ends at the right time, it doesn't stretch needlessly its story. As you can see, I genially enjoy this film but I still found problems in it. Tom Cruise is not an actor, he is a movie star, so as in every movie he is the same smiley and narcissist persona that he is in most of his films (sure, his character progresses throughout the film but Cruise\u00b4s acting is the same), the romance is not believable and it is an unnecessary distraction, the story might be clever and fun to watch but it is extremely predictable, it lacks a memorable score, you never get attached to these forgettable characters as the storytelling is pretty focused on the alien invasion, and it goes to safe territory with its ending when the whole concept was meant to have a dramatic conclusion. \n\"Live Die Repeat\" is one of the most enjoyable and clever summer blockbuster that have arrived in the new millennium, it has its flaws but it also has tons of greatness. It truly deserves its cult status and it may outshine \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" for the position of my favorite 2014 summer blockbuster.",

I remember seeing the trailer for this film during a Godzilla IMAX 3D screening, thinking it looked too much like a video game and that it looked so clich\u00e9. I didn't grasp the fact that it was like Groundhog Day meets Terminator, and the result was a great deal of fun.\n\nFirst of all, this film has a good casting of leads/important characters, such as Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt (who I had not seen much of before this film) and Brendan Gleeson (who I LOVE in In Bruges). Some people hate Tom Cruise, and to that I say give the guy a chance with great roles under his belt such as the lead in Rain Man and a role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia which rightfully earned him an Oscar nomination. Emily Blunt is amazing as the \"full metal b****\" who does not give a damn, knocking out a soldier who nearly calls her by this name. And as for Gleeson, I guess he doesn't really do much, but I like him.\n\nGoing back to Tom Cruise, he plays an iconic spokesperson who has a high military rank, though he is more involved with advertising and wants little to do with actual battle. He is a coward who is sent on a journey to prove himself to be a very brave soldier.\n\nThe Groundhog Day aspect to this film provides a lot of laughs, focusing on funny ways that he dies early in the film and the way Emily Blunt's character kills him over and over again.\n\nThe premise of the film is kind of a stretch to believe, but then again this is science fiction; you either buy it or you don't. Cage is lucky enough to kill an \"Alpha\" with a claymore before dying, and the alpha's blood is splattered onto him and gives him the \"ability\" to reset the day as he dies. These aliens are unlike any we have seen before in alien invasion movies, looking like giant sea creatures with a type of \"hair\" that looks like the features of an anemone. Alphas are very rare amongst them, which are the ones that can reset the day, and their motivations are unknown, but they are a force that the world is fighting against. This is a very \"us vs them\" film promoting global unity to fight a threat.\n\nYou'll be pleasantly surprised with this gem; watch this film.",

It includes action scenes that really blow your mind but not too much that it drags on. The comedic side effects of re living the same day really make you laugh without feeling forced in to make it a lighter film. The same day scenario also isn't a drag at all, each situation feels fresh, although at the same time you feel like Tom Cruise really has died a bajillion times. Emily Blunt is freaking awesome (no surprise), everything she does, like not just flipping around with the awesome sword but even just meditating/yoga when you meet her, its great. \n\nBUT, big ass butt, I will not spoil anything but the ending of this film, like just the last few minutes totally destroy everything. Its like totally out of place, and feels stupid. It does not flow with the rest of the film and brings it down from a great film to just enjoyable.

The only problem is that it delivers so well that my senses almost went into overload. This movie has so much going for it not only talent speaking but from the special effects to the actual plot that is not only intriguing as hell but sucks you in and keeps toy right there with the action, with a couple of good laughs along the way. The only small gripe I had was with the ending that left a few questions but overall I really love this film. Not only is Tom Cruise at the top of his game yet again, but he starts the film playing against type as the coward instead of the gung-ho action star we are used to which was interesting. This film is entertaining through and through and with it being one of the most underrated and overlooked films of 2014, it deserves your attention. A",

Also, very realistic in how the situation arises that Tom Cruises character is put in the situation of going back to the last time he woke up every time he dies. Of course, as a lot of people mention, this movie had a definite Groundhog Day vibe, but that thought is only short lived as we are put in the action almost immediately and the story takes plenty of turns to keep the repeating fresh.

Intrigue commences.  \n\nA fairly clever sci fi/action drama, which is rare nowadays.  Plot is very complex but is for the most part reasonably watertight.  There are a few minor gaps and implausibilities, but it mostly works.  Plus the writers and director know when to quit with the clever stuff, and don't just start throwing clever twists and additional layers of complexity in just for the sake of showing off.\n\nGood special effects.\n\nSolid performances by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.  While Cruise clearly is the main star, Blunt doesn't take a back seat and is as vital to the movie as Cruise.  \n\nDecent supporting cast too.",

The premise is clever and something we really haven't seen before: Tom Cruise plays a guy drafted into fighting against an alien invader who dies on his first day of combat. However, due to some alien time-travelling blood (it makes sense, kind of, I promise) he finds himself waking up earlier in the day and living through the same series of events again (and again and again). Ok, so Groundhog Day kind of had the same idea, but that was still a totally different type of film. This movie has great special effects and action sequences, obviously, but it also has some of the best editing you'll see in a recent movie; if you want to see how a movie can be cut for speed, humor, visceral impact, and storytelling efficiency, here you go. Tom Cruise gives his best performance since probably Minority Report, and Emily Blunt is quite strong here too.

            "content": "Live, Die, Repeat or Edge of Tomorrow is one of those movies (and not just sci-fi) that just goes under the radar really quick. It is a fun movie in every single way.\n\nThe epic action of \"Edge of Tomorrow\" unfolds in a near future in which an alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). And, as Cage and Rita take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy.\n\nLive, Die, Repeat or Edge of Tomorrow is one of the best films that came out last year. It is underrated and unfortunately for this flick, it bombed in the box office. First, Tome Cruise is a coward, did an amazing job playing this role. And Emily Blunt (by the way she was a badass) also did an amazing job. The rest of the cast includes Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson, and a host of other did great too. Not to mention that the acting is well done.\n\nThe movie is surprisingly funny. Unlike a Michael Bay film, the humor in Live, Die, Repeat or Edge of Tomorrow works in a way that is weird in a way. Especially when Cruise's character dies, it just hilarious.\n\nI can't say too much about the action. It is fun and exhilarating every time I see it. It might have a little shaking cam which I hate nowadays but I could tell what was going on unlike most action films. Although I can't say it is original because I have seen this in Groundhog Day and Source Code but it is just fun and just as funny in those movies (which are fantastic films by the way).\n\nThe main negative of this movie is the marketing. Even though this movie is a terrific movie, I never seen marketing of a fantastic movie so bad. And the title Edge of Tomorrow--what a terrible title. When it was released on Blu-Ray or DVD, the marketers changed to title to Live, Die, Repeat which isn't better. Before it was released to theaters, they try to make it seem like this movie is going to be another Oblivion (which was a meh movie). But, it took us by surprise. Fail marketers fail!\n\nDespite bad marketing, Live, Die, Repeat or Edge of Tomorrow is one hell of a ride that should be enjoyed. It is sharp, hilarious, and has entertaining action. I do recommend everyone it see this. And hey, don't let the trailers or the bad marketing fool you.",

            "content": "The concept of 'Groundhog Day' mixed with the sci-fi genre like 'Source Code' and probably a lot of other films because this concept isn't all that unique anymore and you have 'Edge of Tomorrow', which isn't nearly as good as either of those. 'Edge of Tomorrow' might be a thankfully smart blockbuster but that's about it. The acting was good all around, Emily Blunt gave a great performance and Bill Paxton was a lot of fun, even if he did just disappear by the end. It also has Brendan Gleeson who was good and it was fun to see Terence Maynard in this. Tom Cruise gives a typically all-in performance, his character goes on a very good arc and he does his own stunts like he usually does and he just makes this really watchable, even if I'd like to see him do some real drama again, but hey, it's his life and he can do what he wants. Brad Pitt was originally chosen but Cruise gives the character his own unique twist that it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role now. I said that this concept isn't really that fresh anymore but this film does a lot with it and answers all the questions the audience has and it is quite satisfying to watch, for a while. While I'm thankful there is an action blockbuster that actually has a brain for once, even if not as many people saw it as would have been liked, it just feels like this got so much love at the time because nobody really expected it to be the way it was, but, of course, I can't speak for everyone. I didn't go in with raised expectations because of the excellent reviews but when the end credits rolled around I, along with the other two I was watching this with, was just thinking, 'was that it?'. \n\nThe visuals of this film are outstanding and the humour was a very welcome addition as it does liven the film up a bit but the film didn't really do anything for me. Like usual with repeating scenarios you never really feel like anything has any weight or consequence and even when it starts to I wasn't very bothered. While the first half of the film was good, the second half was just average with them performing what they have been talking about during the first half; a natural part of story progression, I know, but it didn't seem to be as creative as the start and it just kept dragging the score down the longer it went on. I liked the film a lot at the start but the more it kept going the more I was losing interest. It just feels like nothing was accomplished and the overall scope of the film felt really small, as repeating scenarios usually do. One of the scenes near the end played out similarly like a scene in 'War of the Worlds', which was fun to see. It doesn't help when the film didn't have any emotional weight, oh, they do attempt, a little, at character development but besides Cruise's character arc, that was all I really grabbed on to and it had an ending that doesn't really follow it's own rules it set up, but, hey, we have to have a happy ending, don't we? We also know nothing about the war they are fighting, but the film blazes past so fast that it didn't really become the issue I thought it would be. The aliens did have a very unique design though, so there is that. They should have called Tom Cruise's character, Nic, now that would have been funny. And I saw a comment on YouTube saying that this should have just been called 'Respawn' and it would have made billions and that would have been a pretty cool name. The title, 'Edge of Tomorrow', does make a lot of sense and is pretty cool but it's the fact that it came after 'Oblivion' and people said they looked similar. As it stands, 'Edge of Tomorrow' or 'Live Die Repeat' or 'All You Need Is Kill' or whatever the hell it feels like calling itself (Cruise/Blunt/Edge? Like I saw on one poster even though I'm just joking now), might have a smart script but it's average in every other department, it wasn't a bad film, but then again, it wasn't spectacular either.",

And I wish there were more content in some areas. \n\nFor instance, the newclips of the intro are gripping, but the intro of Cage drags on rerun, up until he gets bug zapped. \n\nI love Cage's charge around the fox hole and the reaction of Griff wondering just who in the hell is that guy who just saved our asses and is out killing mimics with the Angel of Verdunne, who oviously views him as her mimic-killing peer. \n\nMy absolute favorite part is just after Cage decides to leave Rita behind and tells his boy Griff to get him geared up right and to do it right now. \n\nI could have used a little more of that sort of legend-in-the-making scene, like missing scenes after Cage bypasses Rita to array J squad from the fox hole to and into the trailer park, tasking each soldier for some info along the way that no one else in the squad could know - \"hey, tell me something about you since I just saved your ass.\" \n\nHe also could have set up their allegiance to blast a path to the trailor park by making it known he'd need some help on the ground. \"When I come by and save your ass, I want you runnning after me and listening to what I tell you. Cause a lot of you MFs are going to die otherwise.\"\n\nHe could have brough some guys in the caravan. \"A mimic's gonna hit this thing. You be ready to blast it.\" One of them could have driven. He could have made them all bring extra batteries. And there could have been two or three watching him fly oft in the helicopter. \n\nThe dam drags on reun, even as short as it is. \n\nAnd as long as he gets the power back, why lose it at all? Tighten up that weak-ass plot by having him plug the Omega sensor in the General's office, with an advance team of J Squad and more General-sanctioned teams behind in a last gasp power bombing.\n\nThe final pay-oft of Omega-blood time shift could have happened to seal the deal, overriding his reboot of the day.\n\nNothing with Emily Blunt drags.

Colonel Cage, who is sent into battle against mimic aliens who have destroyed much of the world. Cage is not really programmed for battle, probably because he was caged too much in military offices instead of the battlefield. Cage is scared out of wits, but then something miraculous happens; he dies in battle, and then relives the same day repeatedly. Why that happens? Let me not spoil if for you, but let's say that he became a blood brother of the Omega alien mimic fraternity; they have that? The stunning Emily Blunt co-stars as Rita, a fierce warrior who was pivotal in destroying many of these mimic aliens in a past war. Cage groundhogs into Rita's world and the two team to destroy the Omega mimic plan to destroy mankind. The first two acts of \"Edge of Tomorrow\" kept me on the edge of my seat with its inventiveness in a futuristic action movie. However, the third act of \"mimic aliens vs. human soldiers\" action unfortunately mimicked many other formulaic battle-oriented action flicks. I did like Cruise and Blunt in their performances; and to be blunt with you it was refreshing to see Cruise as a coward character and not cruising with the same old \"machoman saving the world\" typecast character he has played many times before, while Blunt cruised with another bravado performance. So let me finish this review before it ends on the edge of tomorrow. But if you got nothing going on tomorrow, it's not a bad idea to live & relive the \"Edge of Tomorrow\".\n **** Good",

The end of the film (last 20 minutes) was very dark visually, so I had a really hard time picking up what was actually happening.  I thought they could have done a better job with this.

            "content": "Action films, although were used to them in abundance since the 80's, are a great form of entertainment. A good action blockbuster, injects you with so much adrenaline that by the time the end credits roll, your gasping for breath. Not something you see often these days, however films like The Raid, James Bond and Onk Bak lay testament to just how intense you can feel, watching a movie. What these films pride themselves on are wonderful choreography, well shot sequences and of course characters we give a toss about. Having a protagonist being flung around, on screen, no stunt men and caring about the outcome is a rarity these days. Much to my surprise, Edge Of Tomorrow pretty much delivers on a whole host of levels, ultimately falling short on few cliche but giving us a gasping for air experience. After what seems to be an Alien invasion on planet earth, in the not too distant future, world powers begin to create mech suits, enhancing soldiers potential on the battlefield, turning them into a form of super soldier shall we say. Major Cage, does a round of publicity to advertise and sell the war, which he strongly believes the human race will win, with this new technology. Cage soon finds out that he has in deed been duped and is framed and forced into the armies invasion of France, to help with some propaganda, the invasion should go down a treat and thus ensure that the human race stands a chance against the invasion. Only everything that can go wrong does go wrong, leaving Cage one of the few men left, paired with Rita a bad ass soldier nicknamed Full Metal Bitch, to fight the war, not with the mechs but with an entirely new and unknown way of thinking. I have essentially summed up the opening 30 minutes here and to go any further will ruin, all enjoyment and surprise. First off, the story is a lot more intricate and well placed out than it first appears, in fact when the film does shake it up, it does so using humour and some out of this world editing, to craft an experience the film really thrives on. It's also not afraid to build on these ideas somewhat and you as a viewer soon become as lost as some of the characters down to some sterling production work. The screenplay co written by Christopher MacQuarrie is decent and hilarious. It is also, underneath its complex skin, simple. It doesnt try too hard to be intelligent, it does however rely on us caring about our characters. Of course who better to fit the criteria than Tom Cruise, like him or loath him, the man is charismatic, enthusiastic and more importantly 110% involved in everything he does. That means when Doug Liman comes to film the action scenes, we are actually seeing Tom running, jumping, being battered left right and centre, constantly all in a mix of practical and CGI which works strangely to great effect. Emily Blunt plays Rita and although not the greatest female character committed to cinema, she is bad ass, with a touch of human about her. This makes for a very strong female lead and a breath of fresh air to see a woman kicking the seven shades of shit out of an alien race. The film jumps through hoops to heighten this by making Cruise the weaker one at first and having Blunt take on alien mechs with a sword. The rest of the cast sadly, minus Noah Taylor, is just kind of... Well, there! The grunts are grunts, Bredan Gleeson is paper thin and Bill Paxton puts in an admirable effort, however due to the frantic and repetitive nature the film requires, Paxton soon outstays his welcome. Luckily the lead roles are the meat of the piece and both actors hurtle their way towards the finish line all guns blazing. The action sequences themselves are pounding, shocking at first but soon becoming almost like a video game, in the extent in which it becomes so overwhelming we the audience find ourselves at the edge of our seat, never mind tomorrow. The film uses a vast array of practical effects and it pays off massively, allowing the CGI to become allowable. The wars are bold and wild, almost like a CGI littered version of Saving Private Ryan's opening moments. The film of course has some rather annoying dips, which stop this film short of being a wonder. First of all the ending loses its testicular fortitude for a more happy joy, joy ending, which just ruins any tension and sacrifice brilliantly crafted in the scenes leading up to it. The film also hurtles are such a speed that, it takes you quite some time to catch up, your not grounded very well as you start of the journey, leaving you completely disorientated, before finding your bearings. I would go as far to say an effect used to help relate to Cage but he at least has a clue about what is going on prior to the invasion. The film also dips here and there, showing promise with other arcs and not taking them, leaving you scratching your head and asking the question what if. Aside the rushed beginning, chicken shit ending and a few pot holes along the way, the movie is consistant and brilliant. It wont win any awards, although the editing team surely deserve to work in cinema for the rest of time, but it is a fast and furious action/sci fi flick, with huge amounts to offer, even a laugh here and there.",

It isn't \"Saving Private Ryan\" or anything. But it's funny, fast-paced, exciting, original. Cruise's performance is better than I thought he could do. Brendan Gleeson and Bill Paxton are great. Blunt is a smokingly sexy soldier, gentle by nature but tough by necessity at the same time, with subtle vulnerability and true valiance that makes you cheer for her. Highly recommended. It shows how important the \"packaging\" is to deliver a film to the public. A limp title, confusing marketing, and a public confused about what to think of Tom Cruise these days led to mediocre box office results in the US.

Major William Cage (Tom Cruise), a spokesman for the United Defense Forces is signed up to fight, something he doesn't want to do, but has to after he tried to blackmail General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson), he ends up stripped off his rank and thrown into fighting the Mimics on the beach at Normandy. Cage is killed in battle, only to wake up the morning before it happened. He tries every way he can to get out of it, but he can't and the day repeats itself again and again, but he soon finds his answer into getting out of it in Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt.) It's a very good idea for a film, and the battle sequences on display are almost insane, and it manages to have some good fun along with way without (pardon the analogy) becoming repetitive. It's not like other action films, this is that rarest of beast, an action film that's also a clever and intelligent think piece.",

The whole premise is thrilling, and the initial scenes where the day is relived are the best. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt though, was  great. She really enlivened her role and gave heart to a character who was alone and insecure. Noah Taylor was actually the standout male actor and brought excitement to the role like his colleague. Tom Cruise simply played himself, but was still worth a watch. What actually lost me here, as with other films of its nature, was the ending. It just seemed so clich\u00e9d and felt like it was just trying to resolve it, not offering an intriguing conclusion.

Now all things aside this particular picture starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt is quite strong and is quite nicely edited as far as I am concerned in implanting what the story is about right at the beginning of the story . So the storytelling aspect of it is actually shown through editing and good writing. It is shown nicely and there is hardly any need of exposition dialogues. And the execution of the concept is well done . However the vision itself is quite pretentious and lacking actual depth. This is where it starts well and the entire vision of the film is nothing original. It's just shown in a different way . It feels awfully similar to the Matrix specially the last two films of that trilogy . Only thing is this does not beat around the bush with mindless action scenes. The action is well choreographed aided by quite in your face cinematography. Performances were quite solid as were the special effects. However , to me all I felt sitting through the movie is watching a brilliantly executed  The Matrix Revolutions without Hugo Weaving. So overall impression is the movie is staunch in it's execution however it has a very limited vision to begin with which makes this one just good and there is nothing wrong in being \"Just Good\". It will appeal to all action film lovers but will fail to produce a WOW to cinema audience who is able to anticipate what happens eventually. Having said all this the movie does have a sequel potential and that might bring wonders.",

Cruise and Blunt hold the screen and their high tech battle suits are cool. However, really like the song, it a bit boring seeing the same thing happen over and over again.

Normally I don't like Tom Cruise, which is why I originally avoided seeing the film. However, after realizing Emily Blunt was in it I immediately wanted to see it. It was a different character for her and I thought she played it quite well. I loved that she got to use her natural accent in the film. It made me love that character even more. Not only did she have that tough girl with respect that accent just added to it. The \"alien race\" that hits earth actually reminded me of the centennials from The Matrix trilogy. I would be curious if that is where the build of them came from. The super soldier concept reminded me of other films, as well as, The X-files concepts of Super Soldiers. Altogether not horrible. Action sequences were fun to watch and as I said before the concept is relatively cool.",

I also loved it because Tom Cruise's character was a coward, and I didn't expect that. He did a great job in this movie and he needs to keep on making action movies. And Emily Blunt was awesome in this movie as well. She was this awesome action star that I wish would make more action movies also.\n\nThe visual effects were also very awesome. I'm not suprised it wasn't nominated at the Oscars, but I wish that it had. The battle scenes were really cool and I loved how every time the same day played over and over, it was still funny and it worked really well. I also loved this movie because it didn't take itself to serious, as the song during the credits point out.\n\nI honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie, and it was one of my favorite movies of 2014.",

The Edge of Tomorrow is captivating, haunting, thrilling, and hilarious without ever being over the top, slow, or arrogant.  The clever storytelling and incredible look keep you glued to the screen like none other.  The movie is a very impressive and a larger than life piece of entertainment that knocked the wind out of me over and over.  It's hard for me to find the right words even now to describe it because I really couldn't have been happier with it.   \n\nStarring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt the movie centers itself around an alien threat that has slowly taken over much of Europe.  Cruise is thrust into battle with no training and soon finds himself dead.  However, he's not dead.  The day has only just begun again.  No matter what Cruise does to die, he keeps coming back to relive the same day over and over.  Using his new power he works his way through each day getting closer and closer to vanquishing the aliens by learning the steps and unraveling the puzzle.  \n\nEdge is a sharp sci-fi thriller that boasts not only a great story and cast but also the coolest aliens I can remember in recent years.  Moving like a virus the aliens tumble through, whip, slice, and kill just about everything in their path.  They are awesome menaces and brought to life with chilling detail.  The design of the film as a whole is remarkable and the work of a very talented individual.  \n\nWith a great cast, great creatures, and a solid scrip all it took was the touch of a great director and Edge Of Tomorrow has become one of the better movies this summer will see.  I only hope it finds an audience because it truly deserves one.  I often roll my eyes at all the clich\u00e9 garbage that rolls through the theaters all year long but Edge is a surprising movie that'll surely be a crowd favorite for many reasons, including watching the repeated slaughter of Cruise who satirizes his own image in the best of ways.  Way to go Tom!  You may be nuttier than squirrel poop, but you sure can act! \n\nFINAL SCORE = 5/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

It is a fresh idea for the science fiction genre based on the graphic novel. Live, Die and Repeat. Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage, a military officer who works in the PR department who has never been in battle. He pisses off the wrong person, and finds himself stripped of his rank, thrown into a platoon of soldiers headed for a suicide mission. Cage dies in battle only to have alien blood cover his remains. He wakes up reliving in a time loop the moment he is cast into the platoon on it's way to its suicide mission. As Cage dies repeatedly he develops skills to predict the outcome of certain moments to avoid them, he meets Rita while in battle and before she dies she says come find me when you wake up. As he goes through his time loop he finds a way to find Rita. She doesn't believe him at first until he describes what is happening to him. Rita introduces him to Dr. Carter who explains what is happening to Cage.  They strategize how to defeat the enemy...and Rita must train Cage so they can survive longer then they have in previous time lines. Tom Cruise has very funny moments poking fun at his character. Emily Blunt is dazzling as the super solider.  The movie has a fast pace, and has very funny moments as Cage's character dies in very humorous ways.  It is fun to watch, has great cinematography, and is well directed. There is a sense of fun in watching this film.",

            "content": "Starring: Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Brendan Gleeson, and Bill Paxton\nDirected By: Doug Liman\nRated: PG-13\n\nBased on the Manga, \"All You Need Is Kill\" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Humanity has finally won a battle in the war against an invading alien force known as Mimics. Now determined to retake Europe and win the war, soldiers in special weapon suits began to push back on the beaches of France. A soldier named Cage, who is unwillingly sent to the front lines, witnesses the slaughter as they walk right into an ambush. He is killed in action than awakens to find out he has restarted the day again. He is caught reliving the same day over and over until he dies in battle each time. With the help of star soldier Rita, the only one who will believe him, he must find a way to escape from this loop and stop the invaders from destroying the world.\n\nIf anyone could possibly have had a worse time then Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, it would probably be Tom Cruise as Cage in Edge of Tomorrow; seeing how the only way for him to restart the day is thru him unavoidably dying (sometimes hilariously). I got hooked on the cool concept right away and pretty much decided I was going to check it out after seeing the trailer, despite Cruise's kind of lack luster films in the last few years. I don't dislike the guy though and think he's a decent actor so I wasn't going to completely stay away because of that. While it's not as good as other films of the similar subject matter (like the above mentioned Groundhog Day or Source Code) it was still entertaining.\n\nTom Cruise does a nice job here. I don't really remember seeing him in a reluctant hero role before now. Cage is flat-out a coward when we first meet him and Cruise does a great job of showing that without still being completely unlikable.\nEmily Blunt is his opposite as the tough as nails, gruff soldier and the two work good together and play off of each other well as she is forced to train him so he can actually stand a chance in battle.\nIt was also cool seeing Franz Drameh from Attack The Block show up as part of the squad of well acted supporting characters too, which included the always fun Bill Paxton.\n\nThe ending felt a little tacked on, but an opposite ending wouldn't really have worked any better. That's really my only gripe about it. The aliens were cool and pretty original looking and memorable, it's very well acted, and it has some great scenes as Cage tries multiple times to make it thru the battle on the beach alive.\nI enjoyed the movie. Time travel/time loops are a favorite subject of mine. It did a good job of not taking itself too serious and throwing in some funny moments to go along with the serious ones. It doesn't really stand far out from a lot of other movies and will probably be forgotten in a few years (much like Cruise's Oblivion), but I think it's still worth seeing if you are looking for something new to see and won't leave disappointed. I passed on the 3D showing so I don't know if that was worth while, but the 2D show is worth checking out for a matinee.\n\n7 Reels Out of 10\n\n\"You're from America?\"\n\"No, I'm from Kentucky.\"",

Can't say enough good things about this criminally under-watched gem.

Whole humor-from-knowing-what-others-will-already-say thing got old fast too but him dying in funny ways was sort of amusing. Entertaining premise and plenty of action though but silly that doctor person JUST SO HAPPENED to have and was some how able to develop something that could be used on alphas to determine the location of the omega when alphas are so rare and dangerous that they probably weren't able to be experimented on to develop such an device in the first place. Romance was pretty weak but the way things turned out by the ending of the movie made that acceptable IMO (with a very fitting song along with it too right before the credits started rolling).",

I remember a lot of the conversations I had about that film when it was first released and I guess when more people get to see \"The Edge of Tomorrow\" those conversations may start up once again. The only problem with these kinds of film is the \"reality nuts\" and sci-fi geeks\" it brings out of hiding who don't get enough explained to make it work. What I mean by that is it is really hard to turn imagination into reality and there always will be some pivotal points missed or simply forgotten as a consequence. I fall into the later of the two nut bags. For me there were just so many holes left unexplained. I don't believe the director had that intention though unlike Nolan who can pull it off so well. So in saying that the film still has its moments of greatness making it worthy enough to give a decent rating.\nThe plot is one that has been done before but not on such a grand scale. Set in a futuristic world the Earth is at War. Major William Cage played by Tom Cruise (Mission Impossible, Vanilla Sky) is a military journalist never seen a day of combat in his life. After refusing to be front and centre and report from the impending battle against an alien race known as \"Mimics\", Cage is arrested and knocked out, when he wakes he finds himself in cuffs, his rank has been revoked and now finds himself labelled as a deserter. Cage finds out that now instead of being a reporter on the mission he will now be a soldier, a suicide mission as it becomes apparent. Major Cage dies within 5 minutes of landing after seeing a Special Forces officer Sergeant Rita Vrataski played by Emily Blunt (The Devil wears Prada, Looper) first die. Next thing he wakes up one day earlier and finds the day suddenly repeating Cage seems to be caught in some kind of time loop every time he dies the day starts over... There is a lot to give away to the plot if I go any further into the story so I'll leave it there.\nThis is one of those films that we could discuss for years and never come to a solution; I'm sure everyone who sees it will come to their own conclusion which makes it well worth seeing in my opinion. As I stated earlier though I'm a sci-fi geek that needs things to at least work even in made up lands. There is so much that doesn't make sense when thought about, but then there is enough goodness to forgive those mistakes as well.\nCruise is actually pretty good in his role not that it's too much of a stretch from other characters he has played before. Blunt does just as well in her kick ass bitch role as well. The majority of this film was shot on green screen which isn't a problem it just means judging its artistic creativeness with cinematography is almost pointless. The CGI of the Mimics I loved though I thought they were great.\nNot really one for the kids but to be honest I don't believe they would understand its storyline anyway.\nEdge of Tomorrow gets 3.5 BanShee Screams out of 5.\nThanks for reading.\nX\n?#?Theedgeoftomorrow?",

He will work with the most infamous warrior, known as \"Full Metal Bitch,\" to improve his strategy and fighting capabilities.  Despite his new powers, the officer fails over and over again until it appears there is no way to stop the aliens.

The storyline for this picture is very interesting and reminded me of a mix of Matrix, Groundhog Day, and Minority Report.  The action scenes and special effects were awesome and the acting was better than I anticipated.  The cast includes Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton, Brandon Gleeson, and Jonas Armstrong.\n\n\"What day is it?\"\n\"Judgment day.\"\n\nWe grabbed this off Netflix because we loved the previews (big fans of the science fiction genre) and thought this film had promise.  I honestly thought this was on par with Minority Report and a step above similar pictures like I, Robot.  Overall, this may not go down as a classic, but is a nice addition to the genre.\n\n\"I wish I didn't know you, but I do...\"\n\nGrade: B-/B (7.5)",

The world's military forces combine to launch a massive invasion on the alien forces, and Tom Cruise's character is forced into the battle. When he's quickly killed however, he awakes at the beginning of that day and is trained by a powerful soldier played by Emily Blunt to be a warrior and while reliving the same brutal combat over and over again, the two become closer to victory. This movie had epic intense battle scenes that were basically the WWII D-Day invasion with robots and aliens. This movie was exciting, thrilling, and each time Tom Cruise awoke and restarted the battle, it was different each time. It didn't get old.

The supporting cast delivers funny, scene-stealing turns. Doug Liman sure knows how to make a slickly entertaining and visually engaging ride while keeping the focus on characters, story, and what's truly at stake. What it may lack in depth, it definitely makes up for in dark humor and clever mechanics.

It's probably one of the most original plots I've ever read, seen, or experienced in any medium and Hiroshi Sakurazaka is genius for coming up with such an incredible story. Even with a great story, movies have been known in the past to not succeed in delivering on the fantastic plot. Luckily, Doug Liman executed the story arc to perfection and Tom Cruise and the stunning Emily Blunt were flawless. These two essentially carry the entire film and display great chemistry in the process. The action sequences are done well and the cinematography is excellent. Honestly, there's not a single flaw in the film, no matter how hard I try to find one. Yes, it is science fiction, not only from an alien perspective but also because the entire film is based on the concept of a time looping paradox,  so there is an element of suspended disbelief that is required in order to enjoy the film. That being said, I think this movie did as good a job as any I can recall at staying true to the concept. Overall, this might have been the best film of 2014. Unfortunately the marketing team failed miserably at giving it the exposure it deserved. Additionally, the ending may have confused some who are not well versed in science fiction.

The story follows a disgraced general who gets shanghaied into the infantry core for desertion, but when alien blood infects his system, causing him to repeat the same day whenever he dies, he becomes humanity's greatest weapon in its battle against an alien invasion.  Starring Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton, and Brendan Gleeson, the film has a solid cast, but their performances are a little underwhelming.  The special effects however, are quite good and make for some dynamic action scenes.  Still, a lot of the film feels familiar, as it recycling many of the standard sci-fi tropes.  Yet despite its formulaicness, Edge of Tomorrow has some interesting ideas and is full of adventure.",

            "content": "Wow, what a great summer action movie. This is what I look for when I go into a big action-packed blockbuster. It's smart, it has a great sci-fi premise, it's action-packed, it has interesting characters and character dynamics, and it has a lot of humor in it.\n\nLet's address the humor, shall we? This movie had so many moments that made me laugh. It really used its central conceit well, making light of many of the deaths (especially in the outstanding sequence of Rita continually shooting Cage, despite his pleas). I also love the line \"Don't shoot him again.\" The editor of the movie should definitely get props.\n\nThe movie could've gone wrong in so many ways due to the inherently tedious nature of the plot. Each time some progress is made, you know that Cage is probably going to die again, so sometimes it can feel like there's no forward motion. But the genius thing is how the movie skips many key sequences of Cage gradually learning, yet still manages to provide enough information in each scene to keep the viewer aware of what's going on. Going back to that line, \"Don't shoot him again,\" it becomes immediately clear that Cage and Rita have gone on this mission many times already. Lots of scenes provide necessary background information to remind the viewer that they're not seeing EVERY repetition. In unseen scenes, Cage learns extra information about General Brigham, in addition to the rest of the military team, to prove himself later. He nails every little move through sheer repetition (like the hilarious scene of Cage getting run over by a truck and then successfully rolling a moment later).\n\nAnd yet the movie is also able to use that uncertainty about how many times Cage has repeated the same day to its advantage to purposely confuse the viewer, like the scene when he admits Rita always dies at the same point. It allows for a lot of great surprises as the viewer watches Cage effortlessly dodge blows and sarcastically predict the exact words someone will say.\n\nLastly, there's Rita, who's just a great character. I'm not sure why I enjoyed her so much, but she's the perfect 'strong female character.' She's a total badass, but she doesn't look masculine. She's really smart, but can concede that Cage is the one with whom the real power lies. But even though she exists primarily to further Cage's arc and to help him on his mission, she's a strong and intelligent character in her own right. She's the one with the intelligence and the power throughout most of the movie, and it's great to see her training Cage.\n\nThe one negative element of the entire movie for me was the kiss between Cage and Rita. Honestly, I'm very tolerant of predictable romances in movies, and I wasn't even opposed to a romance in this movie, but the kiss itself seemed out of place based on Rita's character. I would've preferred that the scene just ended with Rita saying, \"I wish I had more time to get to know you\" or whatever, and then left it like that. There'd been some sexual tension throughout the movie, but I would've preferred it to be tension that doesn't really get resolved in any explosive way.\n\nI know a lot of people probably thought the ending of the movie was too pat and happy, and I can definitely understand that. There's definitely something appealing about the thought of both Rita and Cage dying and sacrificing themselves to save the world. At the same time, though, I just love the idea of Cage living to tell the tale, and coming back and finding Rita and bonding with her because they're the only two people who've experienced the time loops, and them actually getting the time to get to know each other like Rita had hoped for. See, you can tell that I really do like the idea of them as a couple; it's just that I didn't think the kiss belonged in the movie. They could've completely cut that out and ended the movie the same way, with Cage laughing at Rita. That was a perfect last shot.",

Tom Cruise plays his role as an army captain well, progressing from reluctant soldier to a man accepting his fate and determined to fight his way to the end. Cruise has great chemistry with Emily Blunt as Rita in her role as another soldier he partners with to defeat an alien invasion. The romantic subplot is believable and makes us think about what is really important in our lives and what we should do with the small amount o f time that we are given.

Go into battle, kill some aliens, meet a grisly demise, respawn at the checkpoint and try it all over again; that's basically the plot. It's best when Cruise is relegated to mere rapid-fire cannon fodder, trying like hell to make the most of his chances and failing miserably. The ride gets markedly less entertaining, and more humdrum, as it slides into sentimentality and finality. The ending is a real whiff, too, and undoubtedly colors my memory of the better bits that I'd enjoyed previously.

It distracted from the story of a fearful campaigner turning into a servant hearted solider, and was not appreciated. Honestly \"The Edge Of Tomorrow\" sits on the edge of greatness. The characters  and story are compelling, the messages sound, but there isn't enough there to take it from that edge.\n\nSo while Cage did indeed Live. Die.

            "content": "This movie is exactly what most people are saying about it; Groundhog's Day meets Starship Troopers; to that I would only add, with the ending of Cruise's last sci-movie. Director Liman, who already impressed me years ago with Mr. & Ms Smith, once again delivers on a quirky OTT popcorn flick with another strange romance. Not to imply that there is much romance in this movie, but although its plainly obvious, Liman still managed to surprise me when Cruise's Cage begins to fall for Blunt's Rita. The movie wisely capitalizes on Cruise's smugness and endlessly kills him onscreen until that self-serving smile is gone and Cruise becomes all we really want from him, which is action hero mode.\n\nI feel bad for Blunt, who now has a a trilogy of under-appreciated sci-fi flicks, with Edge of Tomorrow joining Adjustment Bureau and Looper. Her performance is a strong one rooted in the physical, but lacks some of the charisma and personality of previous turns, nonetheless she holds our interest well and holds more than her own against her costar. In fact this movie makes a better fit in her filmography then it does Cruise's. The time travel and its consequences on characters echoes the mechanics seen in Looper and the fate-changing in Bureau. Likewise the mapping out of the battlefield choices and the kill-death-repeat nature of the movie reminded me allot of Adjustment Bureau.\n\nThe special FX are really impressive with the mech-gear that we all wished we'd seen in the Starship Trooper movies. The aliens are pretty cool, reminding me a little of The Matrix, mixed with the Drej from Titan A.E. The finale set in war-torn Paris are visually striking indeed, with a fallen Eiffel Tower and a flooded Louvre.\n\nThe movie entertained and pleased me well until its final coda, one that defies sense and seems tagged on just for the sake of having a happy ending for the romantically minded. Aside from that minor quibble, I'd say this movie is sure to please those looking for a good sci-fi flick in the same vein of Blunt's previous entries or something to watch after Starship Troopers.",

            "content": "I realize I'm starting off with a nitpick, particularly since this is a sci-fi film, but isn't it incredibly irresponsible to throw a person without a day of combat training, just to teach him a lesson because you don't like the guy.  In a movie that's about Cage, Tom Cruise, being stuck in a time loop after killing one of the invading aliens' Alphas, which is only happens 1 in 6 million, and getting its blood all over him, which causes him to gain the Omega ability to reset the day.  So complaining about the fact that no military would ever throw an untrained officer in the middle of a big ass battle seems minor.  But it's ridiculous, that's why there's a division of labor.  Soldiers fight and everyone else does what they were assigned to do and never the twain shall meet, so to speak.  Silly nitpick out of the way, this film is pretty damn great.  The time loop concept, obviously, isn't a new idea but this film finds a way to make it feel fresh with interesting character development, excellent action sequences and a clever script that gets the most out of each scene.  I don't think it's bound to reinvent the genre and bring about a sci-fi action film renaissance, but it does do everything exceptionally well.  The film finds ways to combine comedy, sci-fi, and action into one tight little neat package.  It's all working together and one element doesn't undercut the other.  I don't think the film, however, is as thought-provoking as it could've been.  I don't think any film has explored the mental effects this type of situation can have on someone.  Reliving each day over and over and over and over again.  Sure, you can change certain things and alter others, but you're essentially living through the same day ad nauseam.  Particularly if you have to see one person, whom you may have had romantic links to or just really close friends, die over and over again, without being able to do anything to change it.  The film even has some of that with Rita going through this very same thing when she was stuck in her time loop, prior to the film's events of course.  And they also go through this with Cage and how he's unable to save Rita, no matter what he does, in a certain situation.  Granted, it probably couldn't have focused on this too heavily since there's is an invasion going on that could end with the extinction of all human life, but still, it would be cool to see a film do this some time.  Of course, that's not what the film was meant to be, so I'm not holding that against them, and it's not affecting the score at all.  The character development is quite strong.  Rita is one of the best female characters in any action film in recent memory.  I mean that in the sense that, yes, she may be supporting Cage through his mission, getting him to where he needs to be as far as his abilities are concerned AND saving the world, but she's also pretty badass herself.  It's a nice social commentary on gender roles and I think it works for the best for this film.  If there's one point that I think weakens both characters is when they share a kiss in the climax.  It felt so out of place.  On the one hand, it could've been done, since Rita initiated the kiss, that it was her accepting the fact that neither of them would survive this moment.  But it felt more like 'we have two attractive leads, we HAVE to have them kiss'.  It doesn't really work in the context of the story.  It's completely unnecessary in my opinion.  It doesn't really change my view of the film, but it does, very slightly, hurt the characters.  The film very much plays out like a video game.  In the sense that when you die, you get to restart over earlier and you're the only one aware of what happened.  Ironically enough, the book this film is based on, was heavily inspired by the author's time spent playing video games.  So I'm not sure if this is a conscious decision in this adaptation's part or not.  Then again, any action film with a time loop concept will always be reminiscent of video games.  I also read somewhere that this is a meta commentary on summer blockbusters and how numbing the whole thing can be.  Watching the same movie over and over with only slight deviations.  I don't entirely agree with that, but I can see how a person would think that.  It's a well-thought out theory.  I say this because this is not only exclusive to summer blockbusters.  It might be more noticeable with them, since there's so much more of a promotional focus on these films, but it's not exclusive to that particular genre.  The special effects are great, as is the action choreography.  Everything in this film happens for a reason, everything plays a part into how the film climaxes.  There's no filler in this film and that's always a good thing.  Particularly when there seems to be so much padding in many other films.  But I digress, this is definitely worth your time.  It's not gonna make my top 10 of 2014, but it finds a nice balance and it manages to find a way to appeal to both men and women equally.  Not many action films can say that they found a way to create a compelling female character without resorting to stereotypes.  Great film.",

You've got to hand it to Japan though. I don't know if this movie was adapted wholly from its source, but Japan is indeed a country of amazing ideas. I'm pleased to say that this is one of them. If they can make a story of war and aliens to be exciting, then it IS exciting, regardless to the fact that it's not even your thing. \n\nThough at first it started off like your regular war alien invasion war movie, when the concept of time-loop sank in, it became a totally different experience. I found myself laughing and enthusiastically excited about what's going on next, and that's not an easy accomplishment. A praise is in order for the team that managed to adapt this story into such amazing and brilliant screenplay. Not only it felt smart, but also worked even when the concept itself is not something new. Sure, nitpicking will draw out numbers of issues, but it's amazing how it was able to drag you into the story, kept you in place eager to learn more about the final outcome. I know for sure it had that effect on me. But really, the biggest highlight of the movie would be the tough slashing Emily Blunt, playing the deadly soldier Rita Vrasivksi. Her commanding presence stole the scene and brought integrity to her character, though in a way it's a testament to Mr Cruise for being able to steer himself away from hogging on the spotlight. Their interaction felt organic, and Rita is a strong character that it's obvious why we ended up rooting for her to survive. \n\nIf I had the chance to return to the past and redo things I've done wrong, I'd totally do it especially if there's a way to end the process whenever I want. One thing I will definitely do though, is to watch this at the theatre when it premiered. \n\nIt's such a disappointment that this movie didn't get a much much better public response, because it truly deserved it. A movie this good should've attracted more box office numbers, especially with plenty of rave reviews pouring to support it. I do understand its 'lack of appeal' though. Echoing my own three points I mentioned above, it's possible audience have grown fatigue with the lead actor, or the theme of the movie itself. \n\n----- \nFull Review available at http://furederiko.tumblr.com",

            "content": "Referred to originally as 'All You Need is Kill' which was the title of the sci-fi novel this movie is adapted from. Since that title was poo-pooed by the vast majority despite it being the actual original title of the material...'Edge of Tomorrow' was thusly born which personally I think sounds like a tacky 70's sci-fi TV show or perhaps a Dr Who episode. Over time that too was also apparently poo-pooed by the vast majority, and so the movie has also come to be known as 'LIVE. DIE. REPEAT.' On reflection this is actually a solid title.\n\nNow I don't know anything of the original source material so I can only go by what the movie presents to me naturally. Set in a near future where humans are at war with an alien race that is threatening to wipe us out for good...original much? So its business as usual for this sci-fi actioner, the clever twist being amongst the alien ranks are a special larger breed called Alpha's. These Alpha's have a unique genetic trait that when they get killed they somehow automatically respawn again at the beginning of their day, turning back the clock and reliving the day they died. This gives them an advantage in the war plus it opens up some pretty humongous questions about these creatures like...how the fuck?! Do these things ever die then?? How does their blood even do this? and when Cruise gets infected with this gift do the other Alpha's lose it?\n\nSo first things first the film introduces us to the human element and Mr Cruise, I must say its very refreshing to see Cruise actually playing a cowardly whining desk jockey instead of some super soldier...no wait. Although I still can't quite work out why exactly General Brendan Gleeson wants Cruise on the front line, merely to record the battle? anyone can do that. It also baffles me how Cruise is somehow dumped in with the grunts after being knocked out and no one seems to recognise him, its like he's a new recruit and no one has ever heard of him. I'm pretty sure in that situation some one would know of you or you'd be able to contact some one higher but anyway...I guess everyone was in on this dastardly plan to get Cruise in the thick of it.\n\nThe military side of things all seems very familiar truth be told, I dare not mention James Cameron's 'Aliens' but...it all looks like James Cameron's 'Aliens'. Most of the technology feels very space Marine-esque with the obligatory predictable bunch of space Marine-esque tough nut characters all led by Bill Paxton as an aged Hudson. There's the tough as nails Latino looking female, the fat guy, the crazy-ass guy, the slightly clever guy, the token black guy and various other headcases...military unit 101. What I don't get is why the leading kickass female played by Blunt carries a bigass sword...in a world of huge guns and powered exoskeletons (with mightily powered shoulder cannons ala 'Predator') why would you need a sword? Sure it looks cool but it makes no sense. Oh and we see her small team of elite special ops fighters with her at one point. All looking very imposing with their helmets adorned with skull motifs...where the hell did they go??!!\n\nPersonally I thought the casting for the grunts was poor with all coming across as little more than stereotypical cliches portrayed badly. None are memorable with no standout lines or moments and they just looked like standard videogame fodder. This leads me to the aliens which again I didn't really like, why does everything these days have tentacles? These things merely came across as a big ball of spikes that zipped around like Sonic the Hedgehog, impossible to make out properly and unthreatening because they just look like blurs of tentacles. Oh and they have acid blood?? errrr...('Aliens'). I also found it hard to believe that the human military superiors refused to believe their leading scientist on the alien genetic makeup. This guy is there for that purpose and he knows what's going on but no one believes him...soooo what's the point in him being there?\n\nVisually the film is pretty awesome...in the first half hour whilst we see Cruise fighting on the beaches WWII style. Its all heavily influenced by the Normandy invasion of WWII (see 'Saving Private Ryan') with lots of mega sized vehicles coming out of the sea and the sky, troops storming the beach and being cut down easily, trench fighting, mighty explosions lifting waves of sand into the air etc...its very impressive and looks fantastic. Its also really fun to watch Cruise get killed time after time as he tries to navigate his way to certain people or locations trying to recall what to do and when. Hell...seeing Cruise die in a movie is unique in itself! Watching this character refine his skills and learning what to do and where to duck is actually really cool despite sounding dull, you kinda want more of that in the end. Once things start to move away from this scenario and the plot slowly progresses the movie does lose its exciting visual appeal and things become slightly mundane. \n\nThings do get a tad slow towards the finale and the actual ending is also weak, it builds up so well but can't deliver in the end. Its a shame because the first half of the movie is really explosive, fast paced and wonderfully thrilling but its just falls away from the midway point. It also becomes typically daft after Cruise loses his special powers yet still manages to survive some incredible falls and situations, so in the end its back to the regular invincible superman Mr Cruise again.\n\nAt first I didn't realise it but upon reflection it dawned on me that this project is actually a very smart little videogame movie. The entire concept of dying and respawning straight away at a certain location or save point is of course a videogame concept. It does feel like your watching someone playing a new Xbox One (Playstation 4) shoot em up as they work their way through the levels. Personally I liked the first half, the build up is great but the pay off is meh. Casting was also mediocre in my humble opinion as no one really stands out in my mind and nothing is really memorable accept for seeing Cruise getting wiped off the board in a variety of ways (the hook). I can't help but feel the whole movie would have been even better had it been set in its native Japan with a slightly lesser known cast or at least not as big. That said its definitely a solid sci-fi action movie with a decent plot, I just feel it had the potential to be an outright classic but just swung and missed. On a final note the end credits music track is bloody awful.",

It's unique and fun to try to piece together the logic of the movie, more so than Blunt's own Looper 2 years ago (which relies I guess on somewhat similar logic).  Still there is the whole magic blood mumbo jumbo, but the film for better or for worse is saved by Cruise.  He really feels miscast as a guy needing to be trained by Blunt, even though really he seems to stand his own anyways (since we know him too well as the guy who is well... invincible).  The ending is also wtf.  If there was maybe more sacrifice it would have paid off, but it just felt off.  Overall, even though there are these problems, it was more interesting to piece how he would solve the issue more and I feel I might have heavily overlooked that, but the point is you're supposed to enjoy yourself at the movies, so since it hit that mark, I feel it succeeds even if it won't be a masterpiece or instant classic.",

            "content": "A race of aliens called Mimics has taken over continental Europe. General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson), head of humanity's United Defense Force, orders Major William Cage (Tom Cruise), a public affairs officer and former advertising executive, to cover combat on the beaches of France during the next day's assault on the Mimics. Cage objects to the dangerous assignment and threatens to use his public relations skills to turn the public against Brigham when the casualties start increasing from the invasion. General Brigham has Cage arrested; Cage is knocked out during an ensuing escape attempt. He wakes in handcuffs at a forward operating base at Heathrow Airport and discovers he has been labeled a deserter and put on combat duty for the invasion under the command of Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). The invasion is a disaster for the humans. Cage manages to kill a large Mimic but dies as he is sprayed with its acid-like blood. He then wakes up at Heathrow the previous morning. No one believes his story that he knows the invasion will fail. He repeats the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow until he encounters Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). She recognizes his ability to anticipate events and tells him to locate her the next time he \"wakes up\". Cage finds Vrataski at Heathrow. Together they meet up with Dr. Carter (Noah Taylor), a former government scientist and expert in Mimic biology. Cage learns that the kind of Mimic he killed in his first loop, an \"Alpha\", resets time when it is killed to give the Mimics an advantage in battle. Cage inherited this ability when he was doused in the Alpha's blood as they both died. Vrataski had this ability in the recent but only successful battle but lost it after receiving a blood transfusion. She tells Cage that they must hunt the Mimics' hive mind, the Omega. And, as Cage and Vrataski take the fight to the Mimics, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy...\n\nDoug Liman directed the film based on a screenplay adapted from the Japanese light novel \"All You Need Is Kill\" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Cruise Sci-Fi alien thriller \"Oblivion\" was a doze for me despite its great cinematography and visuals. So, I was hoping for something better in the genre from Cruise this time around and \"Edge Of Tomorrow\" delivers for sure. It\u00b4s always tricky with time looping movies since how many times can you repeat the same scenario before the audience lose the interest. \"Edge Of Tomorrow\" is balancing on that line for a moment, but manages to keep it on the right side and it doesn\u00b4t get lost in the progress. I like the development of Tom Cruise character from a terrified public affairs officer in combat to becoming a hardened soldier. He fits the role as Cage and so does the talented and beautiful Emily Blunt in her role as Rita. Love the scene when she is doing yoga in the battle training room and being approched by Cage. She manages to balance her role as the \"Full Metal Bitch\" and yet being vulnerable at the same time. Justin Chang of Variety called \"Edge of Tomorrow\" \"a cleverly crafted and propulsively executed sci-fi thriller\" and said the film was director Doug Liman's best since The Bourne Identity (2002). Chang said the screenwriters, with the assistance of the editors, \"tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times, sleight-of-hand), transforming what must surely be an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for our hero into a deft, playful and continually involving viewing experience\". The critic said of the relationship of Cruise and Blunt's characters, \"Liman handles it with a pleasing lightness of touch that extends to the proceedings as a whole.\" He also commended the visual effects of the \"expertly designed Mimics\" as well as Dion Beebe's cinematography. It\u00b4s hard to not think of Verhoeven\u00b4s \"Starship Troopers\", but \"Edge Of Tomorrow\" carries its own uniqueness, weight and strength. An alternative, darker ending was considered for the film as follows: As they approach Paris in the drop-ship, Cage briefs the soldiers that they must not kill an Alpha or it will cause a time loop and \"we'll be right back here having this conversation, and we won't even know it.\" During fighting, one of the soldiers gets separated, then confronts and kills an Alpha. The audience sees the Omega reset the day and witnesses the same conversation as before about not killing an Alpha, but then an attack starts and the audience knows that the Mimics have the upper hand as the movie ends. The actual released movie has scenes in the drop-ship where the soldiers are reviewing Cage's warning and one says \"Do not kill an Alpha or we'll never even know we had this conversation and they'll know we're coming\". Also, when the Mimics begin firing on the ship, somebody yells \"They know we're coming, Cage!\" These scenes were probably filmed for the alternate ending. I think \"Edge Of Tomorrow\" is really well made, intriguing, popcorn action fun and the CGI is top notch. And I don\u00b4t have any issues with the ending.",

But pretty soon it becomes obvious that this is no ordinary action movie, and not just because of its extremely fun schtick of resetting the day a-la \u00a8Groundhog Day\u00a8(and much like every videogame that ever existed, which is probably where this film got its biggest inspiration from). The action set pieces are awe-inspiring, the acting is surprisingly good, and, most unexpectedly for this type of genre, there is genuine humor sprinkled throughout. It\u00b4s also tremendously clever, avoiding the pitfalls that any \"time manipulation\" premise usually falls into. This was a very fun film for me, and it is undoubtedly the best action movie I have seen all year. GO SEE IT!   :D",

            "content": "Review:\nI quite enjoyed this movie, which has non-stop intense action/drama from beginning to end. The director added a witty script along with a decent concept which is a mixture between Aliens and Groundhog Day. Although the premise is about a man who relives the same day every time that he gets killed, you do see different parts of that day so your not going through the same thing over and over again. It was cleverly put together by the director, who covered every aspect of the storyline, and I'm glad that it didn't go down the soppy love story route and it just stuck to a full out action movie. The weird looking creatures made the movie intense and dramatic, even though they looked similar to the ones in the Matrix, and the suits were pretty impressive. Basically, it's everything that you expect from a Tom Cruise blockbuster action movie and I personally enjoyed it more than Oblivion and Jack Reacher. Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nTom Cruise really isn't showing any signs of slowing down at the ripe age of 52. He still looks pretty good for his age and he's still pulling off a lot of his own stunts. In this movie, he plays his role extremely well because he adds a little wit to the puzzling situation. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt was great but it could have done with a couple more decent actors as his crew. Its good to see Bill Paxton back in a decent movie but the director should have used Brian Gleeson a bit more. Anyway it's definitely worth a watch for its originality and great concept and I personally think that you will see something different every time that you watch it.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: $178million\nWorldwide Gross: $369million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there action movies about a man who relives the same day every time that gets killed. 7/10",

Like, you assume you're always in Cage's POV but sometimes you're in Rita's and you don't know it right away. That's cool. By the way, I think it's cute that the two women in the movie are named Rita and Nance, like Rita and Nancy Taylor from Groundhog Day. Nice. I liked the significance/irony of the repeated lectures, speeches, events, and images. I wouldn't say this is a deep movie but it's not without meaning. The book thingy it's based off of is called \"All You Need Is Kill\" and the fact that it's \"Kill\" and not \"Love\" is exactly what this movie is about and has to say. It's not terribly deep but it's an interesting and unique idea. Also it's about the idea of how in a video game, no matter how many times you die, you're gonna win!

It's weird to think like that since I don't think most of America thinks of Cruise as anything less than a money-making A-list actor.\n\nHis journey from biggest actor in Hollywood to couch-jumping crazy was remarkably short. It's been a long time since that Oprah appearance--over nine years. But the second that Oprah episode ended, everything sort of changed. The Tom Cruise mystique had been stripped away. Instead of being the \"it\" actor, he was just a guy who was crazy. His Scientology religion didn't much endear him in the public eye, either. And it seemed as though he and Katie Holmes just shriveled out of public view to start their life.\n\nWhich isn't to say he hasn't been around since 2005. Mission Impossible III released in 2006. Tropic Thunder in 2008, while a small roll, showed that he still had screen charisma. MI: Ghost Protocol rolled in as a nice nostalgic film. Little could be looked at on his IMDB page between 2005 and 2011 as being much more than a former star getting random roles. Nothing sticks out as being anything other than the slow, grinding halt of a once massive career that no longer exists.\n\nBut over the last couple of years something seems to be improving. You could say it started with Ghost Protocol, though a 4th installment of a series still looking to top the first Mission Impossible movie is hardly the best example, though it does make for a fine stepping stone. No, the more interesting movie is Jack Reacher from 2012. While not an amazingly creative film, Jack Reacher showed us again what makes Cruise such an engaging action hero. And then Oblivion in 2013 reminded us that he's had a long history with edgy sci-fi films.\n\nWhich brings us to the awkwardly titled Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow.\n\nIt's a mixture of Groundhog Day and War of the Worlds. And it's not perfect; leans too heavily on some shifty logic. But it's hard to care while watching.\n\nLive Die Repeat showcases an awe-inspiring sequence of events, encased in a gritty sci-fi/war environment, and Tom Cruise making us feel like it's 1996 again. The biggest downside is that despite the high ratings, it seems like most people are ignoring it like they've ignored most of Cruise's stuff in a post-2005 world.\n\nStill, despite how fun Jack Reacher and Oblivion were, Live Die Repeat is a movie that is not only fun, but just really good in most respects. Hopefully it portends good things for Cruise movies in the future.",

It loses some of its edge to the darker visuals in the final third of the movie where everything is murky and you can't see it really well. Otherwise, a strong movie which you can definitely enjoy. \n\nStylistically, I had read about it being similar to 'Independence Day'. The final scene did do remind me of the infamous F16 to the spaceship scene from the 1999 movie but I wonder if its something to do with me reading about it or maybe that affected my judgement which was slightly tainted. Otherwise, a solid movie, totally recommended to watch it and enjoy.",

In the midst of the ongoing fight to repel them a Major that has never been to combat is sent to the front line. When Cage (Cruise) refuses to do so he is debased and dumped in the battlefield anyway with absolutely no idea of how to use his hi-tech combat suit. During the struggle he accidentally kills one of the \"omega\" a top ranking alien that in dying passes him the skill to reset the day. Cage relives the battle day over and over again trying to locate and kill the other omega that is lurking somewhere in Europe. During his numerous \"try outs\" he meets the war poster girl, Rita Vratasky (Blunt), a warrior that teaches him how to navigate and master the skill that might save humankind.\nThis is a \"Groundhog day\" of the future, a man caught in the same day until he learns his way out but instead of a comedy here we have a thriller format. It is easy to get a little lost in the many twists of the story, it happens often in films where the time factor is stretched and distorted, however it is, in the overall, an engaging epic with loads of action and fights and with no space to get bored. This is a typical Hollywood product with good storytelling and very appealing and sophisticated special effects which fans of the gender are meant to love. The chemistry between the two main leads also helps to make this a very round film.",

It's a film that nobody saw and turned out to be just a below average grosser thanks to the poor trailer and the bad promotions. People might have expected the same level of intelligence from Cruise's last sci-fi film, Oblivion(2013)( another film with a good Tom Cruise performance). Edge of Tomorrow doesn't provide much seriousness, but thanks to it's cast, it provides much entertainment. It's no Source Code(2011) or Snowpiercer(2014), and that's due to the lacking of emotional quotient. Tom Cruise alone is needed to carry on with such a project, but his depleting fan following is not a cause for joy. This is perhaps the first Doug Liman film that I have seen and his direction is ok. What's this film really like? It's like the terminator meeting alien with a Saving Private Ryan setting overall and sci-fi elements which resemble gaming. You play a game, you lose on a particular mission over and over again until you know every thing that's gonna come against you and then you win.

Joining Groundhog Day and Source Code as \"repeat-day\" films the movie shares some themes from those including the learning new things each day, re-planning situations based on knowledge gained as well as a musical montage to show a \"training\" section - here Andie McDowell's slaps are replaced with Emily Blunt's robotic training claws that batter and bruise Cruise. The time loop narrative is effective and Cruise ultimately gets better at fighting the aliens but the movie also has a great supporting cast who help deliver the high concept plot. Blunt plays an elite special forces fighter who is used to promote the cause to new recruits but who also knows more about the aliens than originally thought, whilst the much-missed Bill Paxton (Aliens, Twister) returns to sci-fi as a bombastic Sergeant putting Cruise through his paces. Brendan Gleeson is a nice addition but underused as a misinformed General and the European settings of London and Paris were a fine change from the regular California locales that audiences are used to from such summer blockbusters. From the battle-ready mech-suits - which were much better utilised than the similar body-weapons of 2013's Elysium - to the cleverly structured narrative, Cruise delivers a much better sci-fi performance than the stale Oblivion from last year with a twisty concept that (almost) rivals his stunning turn in Spielberg's Minority Report. A big blockbuster with brains, brawn, brute force and Blunt, Edge of Tomorrow is a movie you'll no doubt come back to again and again. 8/10 Midlands Movies Mike",

It is a breath of fresh air in the world of boring and unoriginal sci-fi and action movies of late to see a movie that has great story, characters, and special effects all complimenting each other.  The special effects are great, but not overwhelming as to take you out of the incredible story.\n\nI am kind of sick of Tom Cruise bashers, because this movie shows just how talented he is.  I am not sure many other actors could have pulled off the transformation he did in this role.  Seeing the protagonist grow so much from beginning to end is what makes a movie great.  You care about him and his co-stars and what happens to them because the story is very good and the actors make it so enjoyable.\nAnother great thing about the movie is that the story is so compelling.  The mechanics of the plot devices may seem a little confusing but if you do what I did and rewind during the main point in the film where they give you a lot of exposition it makes it clearer and is very interesting.\nBut the main thing that impressed me was Cruise.  I guess I forgot just how great an actor he is, and this movie proves that Born on the Fourth of July may have been long ago but he still hasn't lost it.\nHollywood... more movies like this please less Transformers.\n-Whizzard",

But what also makes the film stand out is it's ability to make you feel like you are with Tom Cruise for every step of his arduous journey and actually care for him (Scientologist or not, the dude can act).

I saw everyone has mentioned that this was something better than what they expected and that was why I selected this. Well, what can I say, this did give me the change I needed. That's all. So I'm not going to write a long review for this one. Once again this is a perfect example, how IMDB ratings distract people.\nA good movie to pass the time, without getting bored. If this is a your type movie, Then it will grab you at the edge of your seat as well. That happens if and only if this is the type you like (simply, if you like recent time travel movies). \nSadly I couldn't see anything new unless the beautiful girl appears as the main actress. Even the concept which holds the credit of this movie is also influenced by many movies. This was like 'Source code' meets 'Groundhog day' at the location where 'Pacific rim' was shot.\nThe story is pretty predictable when you watch half of the story. Yes, it isn't a problem for a movie like this.Usually when a movie tries to deal with time traveling it ends up having plot holes. So does the Edge of tomorrow. But the problem is in this entire movie runs on them.Despite how Cage, who performs the main role (Tom Cruise ) goes back in time, Think just a small incidence happens in a millisecond can change the future of the entire world in a million ways that no one can ever imagine,We don't need to consider entire word. In this movie Cage goes in a loop just like the source code. Everytime he goes to the past, he does the things what he did not do in previous times.though still others do same things as he experienced in the first. That was a joke for me.. I mean seriously, why couldn't they consider about that. For an example, once he was about to get hit by one of his fellows. And then he manages to get released from those hits while he was closing his eyes.Even in this time His fellow does the same thing which he did in a previous time. Him closing his eyes don't make any sense.This kind of things happens throughout the entire film. Just like cage does whatever he wants in a pre scheduled scenario.\nThe way this movie ends,sadly ruins my all positive opinions. I think they try to be brave bringing that kind of ending. Failed attempt! , I suppose. But I know there is an ordinary audience who always prays for a happy ending will be happy with the ending.\nJust have to say one thing, I'm pretty sure this one is a good movie among the ones which are released in these days. So 'new movie fans' , check this out. FYI- This is better than 'Pacific Rim' though.\nOriginal Post- https://www.facebook.com/305960452857789/photos/a.493004157486750.1073741830.305960452857789/635835753203589/?type=1&theater",

The brain bug *cough* *cough* setting and time. \n\nI have to admit that the visuals are very well made, but the movie is shallow even for a Hollywood production. Tom Cruise should be able to demonstrate a change in a character in his (combat) boots, but all I see is a tourist with a happy-go-lucky mentally most of the time, unless he doesn't have to talk and just need to point a weapon somewhere. Even when he tries he doesn't deliver anything deeper then a small frown. \nMaybe it's because it's PG 13 but the movie feels like what happens is too bright, like a walk in the park with the accidentally stepping into a puddle instead of a world wide conflict. The other characters don't have much time to shine, which is part of the concept but also centers the whole world around one actor who is doing a half-hearted job.\n\nAll in all I like the concept to combine two great ideas and the visuals, but the execution in the acting department leaves much to be desired. \nMaybe they should have taken a closer look on Starship Troopers and Groundhog Day and chosen someone who has a wider range in acting?\n\nAnd yes, do I need to mention that they *again* decided to disregard their own rules/physics/theories in favor for their ending?",

But when the movie is equally good as Tom himself and it can pull some really mind blowing stunts without making the viewers to worry about the huge plot holes it is definitely a blockbuster. Edge of Tomorrow is a fresh look at the age old sci fi genre that based on alien invasions and courage\u0092s humans who defeat them. And it\u0092s the modern day Independence Day movie and it seriously rocks the foundations of sci fi that came out lately. Huge production, staggering CG and awesome acting makes Edge of Tomorrow one of the best action sci fi\u0092s lately. I wish I can say the same about the plot but though it is amazing at a glance there are plenty of places it fails. But it doesn\u0092t matter when you start to watch because it\u0092s so entertaining that some of your senses get instantly freeze. \n\nIn not so distant future the world is invaded by an alien race known as Mimics. The world is at war and seems like the humans are capable of defeating them. Major Cage (Tom Cruise) who is a publicity agent for the ARMY than a real soldier is sent to the front line of the crucial battle against Mimics without his will. Cage finds himself terrified and helpless when the battle becomes bloodier and a massacre of humans than expected. But coincidentally he discovers a way to manipulate time and relive the same battle and perfect it to realize that the aliens can be defeated using a different strategy. Rita (Emily Blunt) a fellow soldier joins him for the ride. \n\nThe plot here is very creative. When the real time travel or time loop hits the center stage the whole phase and the feel of the movie quickly changes. This is where it gets the true edge against other similar alien invasion movies and the tight grip remains till the very end. While some viewers can be utterly confused by the fact of this time loop and the repeating scenes I\u0092m sure no one would lose interest of the movie because of it. The element of surprise is very good and movie throws in some real candy for the viewers without delays. The flow and the phase is indeed appealing and the peaks and off peaks are well balanced. However as mentioned earlier the plot has many weak points and as a sci fi that makes sense Edge of Tomorrow is far behind. \n\nTom has a history of alien invasion movies such as War of the Worlds (2005) and one of my personal favorite Oblivion (2013). Edge of Tomorrow is another jewel for his collection proving that he is still hot as he used to be decades back. Emily Blunt is sharp and very well fit for her role. The duo does a perfect job on the set and they spark while the aliens bleed. \n\nWhat makes Edge of Tomorrow is so good is its action and animation. They hit you very unexpectedly and some scenes are so majestic and detailed that you might feel that one viewing is not good enough. Starting from the production to the finishing touch of sound this movie is a true action flick and no one can say otherwise.",

This device (before seen also with great success in romantic comedy Groundhog Day) gives way to a playful transition from coward to hero, defeat to victory, all sprinkled with liberal doses of black humour, and some romance by way of Emily Blunt's character, who is effectively more butch than Cruise here. Do not write this off as merely another big dumb Hollywood movie. It's got wits to satisfy the intellect, and enough brawn to satisfy that need for bug and dumb.",

He dies within minutes of landing on the battlefield but wakes up to find he didn't die, he ends up repeating the same day over and over again, in doing so finds that, with the help of Emily Blunt's war hero, they can find a way to destroy the evil alien forces and save Earth. It's a decent film, humourous and comical in its action while Cruise relives his groundhog day of war and realises he should take notes on how to survive a little longer. This is Cruise's film with everyone else just replaying the day over and over so there's not much growth for any other character. If you want a decent action/sci-fi with a sense of humour, you can't go past this.",

Before I give you a little no-spolier warning to the ending that probably most people would interpret and discuss after, here's why the movie is a must-see. \nTom Cruise is as usual the kind of actor working today that knows his movies and how it will go to the box office and to the home video as well. I don't think ever in my life that I have a least favorite Cruise movie. Other supporting actors follow from Bill Paxton and Emily Blunt with roles who most of the time make the movie worth seeing how truly these people will fight for the country and as well for themselves too. It happens that I've seen too many films with reset time concept especially Groundhog Day but with violence, I don't think so. And as you have not think of it, the action scenes and special FX are first rate and mind-blowing. When Cruise's character already saw the same day probably two or more times, that's where the show starts. You're also not expecting to cheer up for this guy to win at this battle as we know that he's not a soldier not unlike Blunt's character who's... Just watch the film I don't want to spoil everything!!!\n\nAnd lastly here's what I think the ending, Yes, they win the war, and yet in that case, something is still not completed or in other words, need to be done. Other than that, LIVE, DIE, REPEAT!",

            "content": "\"Groundhog Day: ...To the Extreme\"! No, this is more like \"Source Code\", only with even more action, explosions, warfare and, of course, aliens, which sounds awesome, up until you see that the director is Doug Liman. Now, I like Liman just fine, but he couldn't keep \"The Bourne Identity\" or \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" consistently exciting, and in case that doesn't scare you enough, they already blanded up the title of the novel upon which this film is based. \"All you need is kill, all you need is kill, all you need is kill-kill; kill is all you need!\" That is a bizarre title for an over-the-top sci-fi film which features mech suits, so, naturally, this film is based on something from Japan. Even more natural is Tom Cruise's presence in this role, because he looks like he's been repeating the same day since he was at the edge of thirty. Speaking of repetition, I'm going to be having Stevie Nicks' \"Edge of Seventeen\" on repeat in my head all day now, but the fact of the matter is that Tom Cruise is still awesome at thirty-going-on-seventy, and knows how to pick some quality science fiction... like \"Oblivion\" (So, what's everyone's problem with that movie, again?), with this film being decent, but not even tight science-fiction.\r\n\r\nNot even the telling of this sci-fi story is tight, for although monotony is, of course, a major theme here, it backs a story that isn't exactly meaty enough to warrant a runtime of almost two hours, thus, things get to be more repetitious than they should be, amidst all of the excess, even in tonal layers. There's a great deal of humor in this film, and plenty of it proves to be fairly sharp, with more than a few moments which are cheesy, maybe even a hint obnoxious in its approach to such low-brow styles as slapstick, which isn't to say that these heights in fluff consistently break tensions a little jarringly. Comic style even overshadows substance, but really, one of the deepest dents in this film are produced by overstylization, much of which is noisy in its molding a fast pace that is fun, especially for a Doug Liman film, but wears you down and thins a sense of focus, no matter how hard the writers try to downsize the focus of this sci-fi thriller. There's not a whole lot of substance to betray with overstylization in this superficial flick, which offers no extensive background to its sci-fi mythology, and not much nuance to characterization, resulting in a serious superficiality that would be easier to forgive if the telling of a thin story wasn't of such decent quality, or if the story was at all original. There's something a little fresh about this particular amalgamation of tropes, but all this story is is tropes, familiar sci-fi and action fluff piece themes that are generic, making for a predictable narrative that is worn down enough by all of the inconsistencies in pacing and tone, and by a lack of realization in stylistic control and substance. A couple elements in writing and most all elements of direction are fairly strong, so much so that they can go into making a more rewarding sci-fi, glimpses of which are found throughout the early and latter acts, and here and there throughout the final product's body, but all but lost amidst all of the underwhelming aspects that make this not much more than your usual sci-fi action blockbuster. Hopes and concerns are met in equal quantity, and although that means the loss of bona fide reward value, it also means the film's coming to the brink of rewarding, partly on the back of technical sharpness.\r\n\r\nTechnical proficiency even leads to solid cinematography, whose well-defined grit captures a sense of tension in this flick, and offers some handsome imagery to catch your eye, almost as much as outstanding visual effects that craft anything from distinguished alien effects to all sorts of explosive spectacle that is at its most marvelous in the heat of battle. Tensions suffer from style, but only outside of the battlefields, because just about every action scene, while a little confusing and very noisy, is awe-inspired in its technical brilliance and intense in its extensive staging, which actually marks heights in the tension. There's a lot of potential for that sort of sci-fi/military intensity in a story of this nature, because even though no aspect of this sci-fi subject matter is refreshing, they all go into forming interesting ideas about time looping, and taking advantage of it for the sake of strategy during warfare that threatens the human race itself. The script by the hilariously named writing team of Christopher McQuarrie and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth betrays this potential through unevenness in tone and structure, and through a lack of extensive attention to background and nuance, thus rendering a potentially juicy thriller near-inconsequential, but not without featuring plenty of highlights in wit and tight spots in plotting to hold your attention when it comes to fluff. If substance has engagement value, then it thrives on the performances, with Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt sharing solid charisma and chemistry to augment charm, eventually incorporating some dramatic touches that sell a sense of urgency and consequence in a superficially drawn narrative that doesn't offer the depth that has been found in certain other action films of this nature, if not by this director. Doug Liman is known for his steady pacing, and I've certainly done my share of joking about that, but here, I am pleasantly surprised that he keeps pacing consistently brisk, tightening up a sense of momentum in this overlong affair, and keeping up high entertainment value, until finding an opportunity to work in some thoughtfulness that, as much as the acting, gives some weight to all of the fluff and what have you, and therefore provides glimpses into what could have been. As I mentioned earlier, the first act's formula is fresh enough for you to be hooked, in spite of the superficialities, and when it comes to the latter acts, substance finally thrives amidst the style, and leads to some compelling thrills, of which there are so very little during the body that the final product cannot achieve the rewarding heights that it culminates with, although that isn't to say that the film is ever less than reasonably engaging as a fun and sometimes weighty, if ultimately misguided watching.\r\n\r\nWhen the day is done for good, too much momentum is lost under the weight of an excessive structure, tonal unevenness, overstylization and a lack of extensive nuance which thin a sense of substance to an already blandly generic and predictable plot, until the final product is unable to reward, even though it is brought to the, if you will, edge, by the handsome cinematography, spectacular effects, stellar action sequences and interesting story ideas that, when backed by clever aspects to writing, endearing performances and chemistry between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, and direction that is more inspired than it probably should be with a film like this, make Doug Liman's \"Edge of Tomorrow\" almost as compelling as it is thoroughly entertaining as an explosive take on a time loop story concept.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

            "content": "Based on a Japanese fiction, Edge of Tomorrow's uses its central theme of reliving time to bring about a captivating and entertaining flick with humor that relies on the warping of time to surprise the characters and the audience simultaneously thrilling us with action that is granted by the CGI battles between the human forces and the aliens. Although it has to be said that if it weren't for the main characters of Cruise and Blunt, this would've turned out be just a generic action flick: they bring about their own wits and charm to their roles as well as showing tight on-screen chemistry.\n\nPlotwise, the premise is about a last hope of survival resting in the hands of the unlikely hero, or in this case a coward who's even afraid to fight. Tom Cruise's character is one of the last means for the survival of the world, where they must complete an audacious journey through enemy infested territories to destroy their leader. The story once set up and details exposed takes off plunging us into montage sequences of the same day and events repeating on each other and the evolution of the main character through his several comedic and violent deaths from which he gains wisdom and eventually succeeds in instilling himself infinite courage. We are drawn into support him and his band of rowdies because we feel when it comes to the case of the destruction of the planet there is no real point in discrimination, as any one of them can become potential heroes.\n\nTom's character and that of Emily share a fine on-screen chemistry where the two has to set-apart their lack of compatibility in personality and work together for the survival of mankind. Often the female is shown as being the dominant one and the one who has the grit and boundless courage to go ahead while Tom is reluctantly entered into his role and the constant failures he encounters saps his motivation. There is conflict because of the mis-match of personalities, which is palpable as on-screen tension but one that slowly withers away as trust and affection seems to grow to a point we are made to feel for their unrequited love. \n\nThe film for a sci-fi action flick relies less on visual drama comparatively and the entertainment of the flick from long suspense of the inevitable conflict, the humour that comes along the junp-cut narrative and the star power of these two actors. The CGI is used is considerably minimal and adequate to the plot or to create thrills by means of hostile aliens and robotically enhanced human fighter gear. \n\nThe film does not delve deep inside the story about the origins of the alien species, but does give us a fairly plausible reason for their xenobiology. Never to be seen as a serious meditation or an existential inquiry into the aspects of time on the human soul, this is a fun ride that does not falter on its what is set out to do- entertainment of our senses.",

            "content": "A lot more SOURCE CODE than Groundhog Day \n Exceptionally well crafted & easy to repeat view   I couldn't care less about Tom's religion or his personal life. His acting here is competent and effective \n\nEmily Blunt is surprisingly magnificent  - much stronger role for her than Adjustment Bureau. \n\nBut the other real stars here are the stunt team and the suits. The bonus feature on the Amazon version is worth watching to understand the difficulty caused by carrying 85 lbs of suit while acting.  The actors have to power the suits that are supposed to give humans a chance against an almost perfect killing machine. \n\nThe script is exceptional for an effects driven thrill ride. This movie is a serious LOVE STORY where the object of affection dies every day no matter what Cage tries to do to save her. Watching that love grow is the part that is closest to Groundhog Day - although the affection Vera Farminga comes to feel for Jake in SOURCE CODE can also be considered despite Michelle Monhagen \n\nThe J squad is another positive element - a clever counterweight to the stubborn General played by Brendan Gleeson and the Master Sergeant from Science Hill, KY by Bill Paxton. The General is almost as lethal to Humans as the Mimics. His stubborn refusal to consider Dr. Carter's insights into the aliens is just the kind of ego driven superiority - stupidity one might think possible in a General. (Think Patton or McArthur) The J Squad misfits are very entertaining and their humor adds excellent laugh-out-loud balance to the alien mayhem. \n\nOBLIVION was pretty dry and sterile compared to this invasion - The Aliens of Oblivion were clones of us - here they are a giant brain assisted by a few Alphas and few billion \"Claws\" or sinewy killing machines of lethal design using javelins of energy - *light and fire. These claws are fast & quick in every direction at once. Their movement is perfection and this will make one hell of an FPS video game. \n\nStill what I will remember is how Cage's love grows for Rita Rose the Angel of Verdun The drive to save the species is personified in the more difficult drive to save Rita AND the species even though she seems ambivalent to the concern.  As the credits roll we are left to imagine how Cage might fare in the new day of life without the Alien threat. Will he manage to finally win Rita's broken heart? That element of Groundhog Day is missing since Rita has no memory of Cage as the alien free day begins.    \n\nTwo \"top reviewers\" pan the film as Rotten. Two of dozens I've seen. I don't get their objections other than one seems to feel that the Alien should have used an EMP weapon to disable all human technology prior to invading. So I guess that reviewer should write his own screenplay. This one succeeds because the effects and stunt work are top notch against aliens that are 'new' in a crowded genre. The actors are well chosen and they fit their roles. But mainly because we can cheer for the humans through Cage's transformation into a man because he falls in love with an Angel - even one who is a \"metal bitch\"    Great Movie. \n.",

            "content": "I've always liked Tom Cruise. It seems like there is still a decent amount of people who don't but hey, we all make mistakes right? For Cruise hes' had Oprah, Scientology, dating Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz (seriously, they are so overrated), Vanilla Sky, amongst other things that made him seem a little douchey but besides that, not much else really.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow struck me as a mix of a few solid past Cruise movies; Minority Report and War of the Worlds. Throw in a little Groundhog Day and you get this movie. Now that doesn't seem like a very glowing review but this was actually a pretty good movie and a solid start to the summer movie season. The film follows Cruise as a military officer who gets screwed by a high ranking general (A Crotchety Brendan Gleeson) and busts him down to private and is going to be thrown out to the front lines to fight an alien race known as the Mimics. The mission goes wrong and Cruise gets killed, but before he gets killed, he is exposed to the blood and guts of one of the Mimics which gives him the ability to wake up and re-live that day over and over. They realize that is how the Mimics were able to win the battle because they in a sense could manipulate time and know what was going to happen before mankind did.\n\nIn comes Emily Blunt's Rita, a bad ass soldier who conveniently enough, went through the same situation Cruise is now going through and arranges for him to find her each day (A.K.A. keep dying!) so she can train him to become a better combat soldier and plan to try and find and destroy the OMEGA (duh duh duuuuuuuuuuuuuh) which controls the entire horde of Mimics.\n\nThis movie could have been a disaster because it's really hard to sell a story that involves you seeing the same sequence over and over again. Thankfully, director Doug Liman and the script writers craft a film that keeps resetting but doesn't keep bogging you down in every little detail. They also don't go overboard with the sci-fi alien back story and details of the mimics and how to destroy them. They give you just enough to stay interested and supplement that detail with some kick ass action sequences. The beach battle is a treat to watch over and over because it makes you think of a \"storming the beaches of Normandy\" (it is in France after all) type scenario and also pays homage to Saving Private Ryan in a way. It's also pretty cool do see how well they have the characters remember and plan every little detail of a sequence that they have lived through before in order to keep advancing. This goes from big scenes like the beach battle to a scene where they are just walking down a crowded hall way.\n\nWhat has made Tom Cruise fun to watch in the past 5 years or so is that fact that he doesn't seem to take himself as seriously as others might think. He isn't afraid to show his comedic side and play the not so traditional \"action hero\" in this movie and it pays off well. He does the almost cowardly, klutzy, warrior well and it really carries the film. Besides Cruise, Blunt is a babe, and Bill Paxton is great as the ass hole Sergeant. In fact, Paxton was basically a grown up version of his character from \"Aliens\" which made it even better for me. \n\nYou will see a little Elysium, Starship Troopers, Source Code, and even similarity to video games like Halo and Gears of War. It all adds up to a much better experience then I originally expected which is perfect because that perfectly describes Tom Cruises' career of the past 5 years.",

            "content": "If you are looking for an example of a movie that is unfairly criticized, look no further than Oblivion. That movie starred Tom Cruise. I would have bet that his latest movie, Edge of Tomorrow, would have had a similar fate. I would have lost that bet. Surprisingly, Edge of Tomorrow has some pretty outstanding Rotten Tomatoes and Flixster scores, but are they deserved?\n\nEdge of Tomorrow has frequently been labeled as \"Groundhog Day meets [insert action movie].\" For the most part that's accurate. Two examples that come to mind are \"Groundhog Day meets Die Hard\" and \"Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers.\" The Die Hard comparison doesn't make much sense to me, except for the fact that Die Hard and Edge of Tomorrow are both action films. The Starship Troopers reference makes more sense since it's a sci-fi action movie about asshole aliens trying to kill us, and so is Edge of Tomorrow. And the aliens look and function somewhat similarly. If I were to be equally uncreative and come up with my own analogy, I'd say it's \"Groundhog Day meets A Few Good Men meets Mission: Impossible.\"\n\nSo why all these comparisons to Groundhog Day? If you've seen Groundhog Day, you know that Bill Murray gets caught in some kind of time loop where he keeps living the same day over and over. In Edge of Tomorrow, Tom Cruise gets caught in a similar kind of loop. That is the reason for the comparison and it's an appropriate comparison to make. Other than this similarity, however, Edge of Tomorrow and Groundhog Day have little in common. One is a comedy and one is an action movie. One more thing they do have in common, though, is that they are both very good.\n\nGroundhog Day was not universally lauded by critics when it was first released. Over time, however, several critics have gone back and \"re-reviewed\" it much more positively. It now has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 97%, but that wasn't always the case. Unforeseen by me, Edge of Tomorrow has received very positive reviews right out of the gate. Don't get me wrong, this film deserves a good amount of praise, I'm just confused why so many critics laud a good film like Edge of Tomorrow, yet tear apart a good film like Oblivion.\n\nA lot of critics criticized Oblivion for being unoriginal. They said it was just a combination of stuff from other movies. Those same critics say Edge of Tomorrow is \"Groundhog Day meets Die Hard,\" which is another way to say it's a combination of stuff from other movies. Yes, it is a combination, and like Oblivion, things are combined very well.\n\nThere are a lot of Tom Cruise haters out there. Yes he's probably nuts, but he also is a good actor, so get over it already. I thought that some of the criticism over Oblivion was due to the Tom Cruise hate factor. Maybe I was wrong, or maybe critics are as inconsistent as gravity is consistent. In any event, the lot of critics and audiences seem to really like Edge of Tomorrow, and they should. It's very entertaining. It's fun. It's even humorous at times.\n\nIn Edge of Tomorrow, Tom Cruise plays Major William Cage, who is not actually a soldier but instead is more of the the public relations guy for the military. He ends up in combat, however, and since he's not a soldier he doesn't fare too well. He dies, but he gets caught in the aforementioned time loop. Each time he dies, the day resets. He is the only one who is aware of this, and he is the only one who can learn from each passing day. At the start of the film, he wears the uniform but is not a soldier and he doesn't exactly have honor. He's a lot like Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee in A Few Good Men. By dying over and over, however, he is able to go through a lot of training and anticipate the actions of his enemies, which turns him into a pretty badass soldier. In Mission: Impossible, Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, who is kind of like a badass soldier. This is why earlier I said you could describe this film as \"Groundhog Day meets A Few Good Men meets Mission: Impossible.\" I've heard some rumblings from Cruise haters that he is once again playing his usual role in this film. First, if that was true, who cares? Second, it's not really accurate because he's definitely not the hero at the start of the film. He actually goes from one Tom Cruise character in the beginning (Daniel Kaffee) to another by the end (Ethan Hunt). If you've seen both of those movies, you know that those characters aren't the same. In other words, he actually has a nice character arc in this film.\n\nThis movie definitely has a nonlinear storyline. Some people say nonlinear storylines exist only to cover up an otherwise inadequate story. There is a name for these people... buzzkills. Personally I enjoy nonlinear stories quite a bit, when done well, and Edge of Tomorrow is certainly done well. When you are constantly jumping back and forth as much as this movie does, there are a number of ways things can go wrong, but they never do in this movie. It is cut very well and it is easy to follow. Another nice touch is that even though we see the same day several times, it is evident that we do not see each day Cage has endured. It is clear that he has had to repeat this same day many more times than what we get to witness.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow has solid acting, great visuals and great pacing. It would take a lot of effort to be bored at any point in this movie. As far as the acting goes, there are really only four actors in this movie: Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Brenden Gleeson and Bill Paxton. Everyone else has incredibly small roles. This film is totally centered around Cage, and if I were to put a conservative number on it, he's probably present for 95% of the scenes. Cruise does a very nice job in this film. Emily Blunt does a fine job too, I think. Emily Blunt is just too damn fine for me to be objective. Okay fine, I can. She also does a nice job. One review I read said she was too intense like Linda Hamilton in Terminator. I don't agree with that at all. I love (some of) the Terminator films. And I would agree that at times, Hamilton was a little too intense. I didn't get that same feeling from Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow. She seemed legitimately tough, but her intensity was not overboard. Other than those two, Brenden Gleeson and Bill Paxton play typical roles for them, but they play them well.\n\nOne thing that surprised me was the humor in this movie. It's a nice and unexpected touch. It's dark comedy, of which I'm not usually a fan, but it is done well in this film. And because you know Cage is going to repeat the day anyway, you don't feel so bad for laughing at some of his misfortunes. I was surprised that there was any humor at all in this film, but after seeing it I'm very glad it was in there. It adds to the entertainment value, and it never detracts from the seriousness of the film, which is why it works well.\n\nSo should you see Edge of Tomorrow? Absolutely. It gets pretty much everything right. My only precaution would be this: It's unusual for an action film to get this many positive reviews, which could cause someone to have expectations that are a little too high. This is not the best movie of the year. But it is easily one of the best movies of the year so far, and that same statement will probably hold true come December. On a slightly different note, how the hell does Tom Cruise not age? Does he look any different today than he did 5 years ago? Or 10 years ago? You win this round, Scientology...\n\nhttp://critiquem.com/",

My biggest complaint is the writing and the characters. \n\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" fails to connect the dots for the audience. It drops the viewer into the film, and expects everyone to pick it right up and follow. There's no \"show don't tell\" going on. It trips over its own feet, and it's FRUSTRATING!\n\nIn order for a film to connect to an audience, the viewer must feel connect to the characters involved in the story. \"Edge of Tomorrow\" completely drops the ball on this. There's hardly an introduction to Cruise's character, and the audience is asked to follow him through the film. Moreover, the rest of the cast (including Emily Blunt's Rita) are merely game pieces in this video game of a movie. \n\nIt may have been just me, but what's up with the camera work and lighting? In most of the action scenes, I can barely tell what I'm looking at, and in a lot of sequences I can't tell what's happening because I can't see a damned thing! LIGHT YOUR MOVIE SO THAT'S IT'S WATCHABLE! \n\nFinally, the writers did a poor job at tying up the loose ends. It felt like they were really rushing to piece everything together. That's never...NEVER going to work if you've already tangled up your film in time travel and plot twists. \n\nI wouldn't recommend watching \"Edge of Tomorrow.\"  1 and a half stars.",

The film is based upon a Japanese novel called \"All You Need is Kill\" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, but it has no superheroes, it isn't a sequel and it isn't based upon any characters previously portrayed in film. Its idea may not be completely original but its tactics and portrayals lead to a completely entertaining trip to the movies.\n\nIn a not too distant future an alien race called `The Mimics' are quickly taking over large populations of Earth. Major William Cage (Cruise), a spokesman for the United Defense Forces, is not a military man, but that doesn't stop General Brigham from ordering him to take up arms and join the front lines of the battle to take back France; a sort of D-Day reboot with Aliens.\n\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" uses the same storytelling method as \"Groundhog's Day\", \"Looper\" or \"Source Code\" and surprisingly brought some of that \"Groundhog's Day\" humor along for the ride. Major Cage is a fish out of water as he is suited up in the high-tech exo-skeleton battle armor and the creators use the time looping moments to successfully hilarious moments.\n\nBottom line, Tom Cruise makes great movies and \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is no exception. It is everything that is great about summer blockbusters and it is everything that has been forgotten about cinema in general. There once was a time when you weren't so certain about the fate of the characters in your movie, full-well knowing that they are either invincible or planned for the sequel. There once was a time when action movies made you actually feel something other than, \"Eww, that was cool.\" And it does that as well.\n\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is a must see for every reason possible. You care about Cruise's Major Cage and you care even more about Emily Blunt's Rita Vrataski (Angel of Verdum). The movie uses the wide possibilities of film and entertainment to the fullest, never letting up and knowing when to be serious and when to have fun with its premise. This is the kind of movie that we need more of and less of the special effects heavy movies that make you feel absolutely nothing. Finally, somebody managed to combine special effects and awesomeness with emotion, humor and meaningfulness.",

Another director and/or editor could have treated the audience as being unable to keep up, and made the mistake of recycling too much of the timeline that we've already seen.\n\nThe only criticism is towards the end, with a battle that's a bit too long, and one really cliched moment.

In fact, I'm going to just go ahead and say it: this is one of the best science fiction films I've ever seen.",

Terrific direction from Doug Liman, who also made the excellent Bourne: Ultimatum, and incredibly adept acting from Cruise and Emily Blunt. Edge of Tomorrow surprised me a bit even with my already heightened expectations, and it took me almost completely by storm. Cruise was thoroughly convincing as a cowardly military delegate without real combat experience, and, as the film progressed, equally as convincing as a battle hardened warrior who had experienced a brutal death hundreds of times over. The action sequences are technically astounding and often beautifully shot with sharp choreography and excellent special effects that blend almost seamlessly with the real world. I was genuinely intrigued by the Matrix Sentinel-esque creatures known as Mimics, and by their strange existence. They are animated very well and the way that they move is shocking. It's almost as if they are hyper stylized blood cells with a viciously awesome ability to destroy their enemies - their disease. Unfortunately for Tom and Emily, that disease is mankind. I had forgotten that Bill Paxton was in the film, so seeing him was a pleasant surprise and he was a welcome face. At only seven years Tom's senior, Paxton was able to portray a convincing, much older, hardened Kentucky born and raised hard-ass career military man leading his band of squadrons against the alien invasion. It was exciting. The supporting cast were all pretty fantastic as well. I found the story to be very compelling about twenty minutes in and that momentum never faltered - even up unto the final sequence. The final shot was absolutely perfect. I have always been a fan of Tom Cruise, and I am a die-hard fan of the science fiction genre in general - especially films dealing with extraterrestrials in any aspect. The Edge of Tomorrow was incredible. I would definitely recommend it without a thought - and I'll be sharing this asap.",

Inventive, fast-paced with glimpses of dark humor and self-irony, this is the perfect combination of breath-taking sci-fi action, alien invasion and surprisingly good Tom Cruise.  With all necessary ingredients for a full-throttle entertainment, Edge of Tomorrow is the most compelling and entertaining summer 2014 delivery so far.\n\nIn the near future, an alien invasion which started in Europe is threatening to annihilate mankind. A former PR and media relations professional and now a Major, William Cage (Tom Cruise) is thrown into battle despite the fact that he has never seen one. Killed shortly after the doomed invasion of his squad, Cage finds himself thrown back to the past in a sort of time-loop continuum which activates every time he gets killed. Soon, after finding an explanation for his state, he teams up with the special ops warrior Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) to improve his skills and to prevent the inevitable defeat of the human invasion into the alien-controlled Europe.  Each killing of Major Cage reveals a new part of the mystery surrounding the aliens and is a step forward towards the defeat of the enemy.\n\nSome might think that the time-loop repetition of scenes would slow down the movie, but on the contrary Edge of Tomorrow stuns with extremely tight pacing,  skillful tension building by director Doug Liman ever-evolving story that captivates the complete attention of the audience.  Add up the unexpectedly darkly comedic elements and surprisingly fresh performances by the two leading actors and you would get a complete summer blockbuster delight. Speaking of the actors, Emily Blunt is at top-notch level as the ass-kickin Rita Vrataski. However, it should be pointed out that Tom Cruise is the big star of the movie and shockingly to many (including me and other non-fans of Cruise) he delivers a formidable performance. Far from being a likeable character, his performance is lacking the typical Cruise-self-assured-ultra-cool-I-can-to-everything image. Major Cage is arrogant, egoistic, scared at some moments. Slowly and thanks to his work with Blunt, Cruises' character grows and gives him a chance to show that he could actually be an excellent actor (even the anti-Cruise fan should admit this when it comes to this movie).\n\nTo me, and probably to many others, Edge of Tomorrow would be the best 2014 summer blockbuster. To few (including me) this movie becomes an immediate all-time classic, due to its story, entertainment and sci-fi value, as well as formidable acting. A must see, Edge of Tomorrow is an absolute sci-fi delight and it finds its spot in my \"favorite movies\" list.",

Some people thought it was going to suck because of the time loop which I understand why they think that. It can get very repetitive and it can get annoying, but I think Tom Cruise and Doug Liman (maybe except for Jumper which I haven't saw) knew what they were doing, so I wasn't worried, and it didn't disappoint. Tom Cruise was great as always, and actually does a bit of a different role than his usual roles which I find refreshing. Emily Blunt is awesome in this with her character being just great, and their chemistry is one of the best parts of the film. It is great to see Bill Paxton in a science fiction film, and he's having fun in this. The time loop is pretty good, and it can give off some dark humor which are hilarious. I never thought I see a death that's really funny and it's intentional for it too. It's very smart which is rare to see in a movie and other films can just be dumb fun, or just dumb. Even though there's a lot of funny moments in this, it does take itself serious, and can be very gripping at times. The aliens are really freaky, they go at them fast for like a second and just kill them. The only thing that took away the five stars was the ending. It's not entirely a bad ending, it just could've been better, and it got me a little confused even though I know what just happen. But if that 5 minute ending was the only thing that's bad in an almost 2 hour film, I don't see the what the big deal is. Edge Of Tomorrow might be the closest thing to a video game movie, and I never thought it can happen until now.",

The mere idea of being able to control time in the way this movie applied it, is inventive, original and will change the way new movies are made. The plot is not at all predictable, this movie is full of surprises and twists and turns. However there are some points where it seems we've missed some things that have happened, my only legitimate complaint is that it wasn't long enough, there needed to be more time to explain to the audience what was happening. By the end of this movie you feel as though you are life long friends with the characters, Edge of Tomorrow is Tom Cruise at his finest again.",

But that's not the end. He seems to be stuck in a Groundhog Day-type loop that starts over and over again as soon as he dies. Little by little, he unravels the mystery behind the loops and develops a plan to use it to his advantage to win the battle.\n\nCruise is funny and on point in this movie. He makes it work. With the help of a great supporting cast (Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton) and equally great production design and special effects, this movie is easily one of the best 'Alien invasion'-typr movies that I have seen in the past decade.\n\nPros: funny, great action, good story, well-acted.\nCons: none, really\nVerdict: Go see!",

It was summer entertainment at its loudest and dumbest, and I don't mean that in a good way. Edge of Tomorrow was everything that Transformers 4 wasn't. It had heart, intense action, great characters, a cool premise, and a story that was chalked full of great humor and heart. Perhaps what really grabbed my attention was just how similar the setup was to Resistance:Fall of Man, which is a video game I happen to be a big fan of. If you're looking for a summer blockbuster that delivers all the thrills and laughs without dumbing it down, then look no further. Edge of Tomorrow is a pristine example of just how good summer movies can get. I like big dumb fun action movies as much as the next guy, but nothing beats a well told, heartfelt story... with mech suits and nasty-ass aliens.",

In this film, a man name Bill Cage (Tom Cruise) joins an army of mechanical fighter to battle against an alien species that are trying to annihilate the human race. So during the war, a weird thing from one of the aliens falls onto Bill and when dies he goes to the past. But it doesn't just happened once but every single time he dies. So he needs help from a woman name Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) to train him in order to fight the alien species and get rid off them once and for all. Out of all the action films so far this year, Edge of Tomorrow is best and original action we have gotten. The film has a good mixture between the Halo and Groundhogs Day with not so much  comedy. Speaking of comedy,the humor in this is really good and not too much to the point you would say \u00e2??alright I get it\u00e2??. Tom Cruise delivers one of best performances I've seen of him in quite sometime. His character is not the character that you expected to be, but he's a whole lot different. Emily Blunt proves more and more why she's becoming Hollywood biggest actress right now. Her character in this is such a bad to the bone character with such a cool personality. The action scene are very thrilling even a bit memorizing. The last few minutes of the film are so enthralling and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Edge of Tomorrow is definitely a must see film for summer.\nGrade: A",

            "content": "Swanner:           The epic action of \"Edge of Tomorrow\" unfolds in a near future in which an alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again. I borrowed the description from the studio because it explains this crazy plot better than I could.\n \nJudd:                I went into this film dreading the experience. Tom Cruise and time travel? Kill me. I hate time travel movies because they generally require too much suspension of disbelief. I hate Tom Cruise movies because he always plays the same smarmy super solider. Edge of Tomorrow, however, hooked me within the first 10 minutes. First, the time travel gimmick is easy to swallow - easier than similar movies like Source Code. Second, Cruise is not the same grating character he always plays. This time around he's noob nobody likes and everyone expect to immediately die. In essence, Edge of Tomorrow is a movie that stars Tom Cruise, it is not a Tom Cruise Movie.\n \nSwanner:           That's a very good way to say it. I was also pleasantly surprised that it wasn't the standard Tom Cruise character. I liked this one and he did a really good job with it. I think the script was the real star of the film, screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) Jez Butterworth and John Henry Butterworth (Fair Game) created a fast pace action picture that had me hooked as well. Movies like Groundhog's Day may work but they always induce eye rolling and watch checking where here I was never distracted or bored.\n \nJudd:                The humor and the editing go a long way to make the movie watchable. As the story is unfolding, every time Cage dies it made a humorous moment. Because of the repetitiveness of the story, the screenwriters made very definitive decisions on what portions to show again as a foundation for the next part of the story. The lightning fast editing kept those choices fresh. Not once did I think to myself, \"Ugh, we have to see this scene again?\"\n \nSwanner:           If there is anything to complain about it would be the sound. Don't get me wrong, the sound engineers did a great job it's the volume level was very high. I don't think it was a theatre thing, I think it was in the print. Other than that this is one of the best films of the year. I did want to give props to director Doug Liman. He's hit and miss with me. This time is definitely a hit!\n \nJudd:                You make it seem like the movie was as loud as that deafening Oblivion - a Tom Cruise Movie. I also want to give kudos to the team that designed the aliens. They were amazing. The way they looked and moved was awesome, and I think they're going to rank up there with HR Giger's Alien.\n \nSwanner:           ****\nJudd:                ***",

He gets blown to smithereens.\n2. He gets run over by a military truck\n3. He gets shot in the head\n4. He has a hole punched through his chest while protecting another soldier from enemy fire.\n5. He is squashed by a helicopter falling from the sky.\n6. He is torn apart by a glowing, tentacled alien.\n\nAnd if that is not pleasing enough, there the rare sight of Tom Cruise - not as a Brave, Die Hard, Superhero - but as a sniveling, cowardly talking head who doesn't have the balls to be a man.\nTom Cruise Emily Blunt Edge of Tomorrow\n\nTom Cruise Emily Blunt Edge of Tomorrow\n\nEdge of Tomorrow (based on a Japanese novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka - All You Need Is Kill) is set in a near-future in which a methodical alien species dubbed \"Mimics\" has touched down in Germany and, over the course of five years, gradually overtaken most of Western Europe. The sole human victory over the invaders has been at Verdun-where a heroic soldier in a robotic exoskeleton, Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt (Looper, The Devil Wears Prada), single-handedly killed more than 100 Mimics and in the process became an icon of the resistance.\n\nThe story cuts to Cruise an Army major, a principal TV spokesman for the war effort, and an exceptional coward. But after an ill-considered run-in with a superior officer, he finds himself demoted, sent to the frontlines, and, soon enough, accidentally imbued with the peculiar ability to reset his day the moment he dies. The Story moves into an invasion that self-consciously recalls the Normandy Steven Spielberg envisioned in Saving Private Ryan. And then takes the form of Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, and Source Code - all mixed into one movie.\nTom Cruise Emily Blunt Edge of Tomorrow\n\nTom Cruise Emily Blunt Edge of Tomorrow\n\nCruise finds himself repeating and repeating the same battle scenario, learning in painful increments how to fight death. The script twists around like its aliens and it's all visually arresting. Emily Blunt, who plays a tough commander is a nice exception to the customary damsel-in-distress narrative: this time out, it's Blunt who plays the battle-hardened vet.\n\nWhat I loved best about this movie was the creative editing where every scene is shown in a different light, the repeated battles, ascending worlds, antiseptic violence, and yes, the unusual & understated chemistry between Tom Cruise and Blunt.\n\nLoy Machedo's Moment of Truth\nOverall, I found this movie to be a pleasant surprise and amazing entertaining.\nA must watch for the weekend.\n\nLoy Machedo's Overall Rating\n8.5 out of 10\n\nLoy Machedo\nloymachedo.com | whoisloymachedo.com",

            "content": "How come Emily Blunt wasn't the main star of this motion picture? She plays Rita, the badass soldier who's also known as \"The Angel of Verdun\" and \"Full Metal Bitch.\" She was the most interesting character here and with nicknames like those who wouldn't be. Instead, we get Tom Cruise in a painfully by-the-numbers role. He's good playing the guy who keeps reliving his days Bill Murray-style, adapts to these repeated instances to hopefully attain victory, and falls in love with the dream woman. But Emily Blunt's Rita is no ordinary woman, she's the war hero whose mug is proudly plastered all over the military base and city. She is greatly admired and adored, winning respect and hearts (maybe that last part is just me). She takes no shit from no one. She is combat-ready, both physically and mentally. She wields a buster sword that looks like it belonged to Cloud Strife and wears a mechanical suit like the one Matt Damon wore in Elysium. She's just too bad. *slap*\n\nYeah yeah, blame the source material, but I'm serious: Emily Blunt is the star of the flick. Tom Cruise is a cowardly agent of chaos. He's stuck in a time loop and dies repeatedly (sometimes hilariously), but his character just goes through cliche after cliche, and much of the story is cliche except the enemy that are being fought against. They're an alien race called the Mimics whose only plan is to take over the world but there is a bit of creativity with these beings as the movie progresses.\n\nTom Cruise plays the coward Major Cage who is ordered to go on the frontlines by General Brigham, played to absolute stubbornness by Brendan Gleeson. Cage gets cold feet and tries talking his way out of it. He's unsuccessful but then, for some reason, he threatens to blackmail the general because... well, because then we wouldn't have a movie. What do you want? Something logical? When this exchange went on between the two I was already bent on hating this movie because of how badly written Tom Cruise's character is. That's the first thing we know about this guy and this is within the first five minutes of the movie. He's a coward trying to weasel his way out of the front lines only to rightfully get arrested, then be branded a deserter, stripped of his rank, and ordered to march with his fellow men to battle... or rather, their doom. How this guy became a Major who has no combat training whatsoever is beyond me. He doesn't have any experience, either. But I digress. If Lieutenant Gorman in Aliens who only did simulated jumps and managed to get that far, then I suppose it's not too far off for Cage to be a Major and also be a wimp.\n\nThey're going against a hostile alien force that look like a bunch of scribbles (you try describing them) and have been for a few years now, and now they're set to launch the largest military operation since the landing at Normandy (D-Day) 60 years ago--and by the way, real subtle with that symbolism, guys, and what makes it even more hokey is that this film's invasion just so happens to take place on those very same beaches in France. And critics accuse Steven Spielberg of being too sentimental. Tuh. Anyway, as fate would have it, we find out that this entire operation is doomed and will always be doomed. The demoted-to-Private Cage, after dying a few dozen times, begins to gain some momentum with his tactics after teaming up with Rita to find out a way to win this war. How they do this is rather creative because it all pertains to how/why Cage has this power of the reset button. Yeah, it makes for some funny death moments but it also doubles as character growth before getting to the real serious stuff that actually had me on the edge of my seat. Much of it was cliche but it brought up some fascinating and sometimes frustrating explication about the Mimics--one crucial moment had me scratching my head that I concluded it was just bad script writing.\n\nRita knows about Cage's reset button. Oh, I'm not spoiling anything. You see it in the trailer where she instructs Cage to find her when he wakes up before getting blown to smithereens (in another one, she kills Cage to reset events). How she knows this may bring up some paradoxical questions but it's fairly simple when the movie explains it. In fact, everything about this movie is simple--big budget features often don't allow its audience to think for themselves and instead half-bake their material. The filmmakers could've gone a bit deeper into the torments of Cage living and dying and seeing everyone die repeatedly, and they kinda did show this moment of crisis. It wasn't taken too far and was easily dismissed once the plot came back. I know it's just a movie but c'mon. His brain might overload since it's implied that this repetition goes into the hundreds. What person wouldn't go mad being stuck in an infinite time loop, repeating everything over and over again and seeing the same people die over and over again and he himself die over and over again? I remember reading an old comic book where a hero had the power to briefly rewind time to reverse a tragedy, and this hero resorted to drugs and drinking because she couldn't cope with these deaths despite saving those very lives.\n\nInterestingly, there were times I began recalling Starship Troopers since this film has those propaganda posters featuring Rita plastered about, like the screenwriter wanted to satirize warfare or the soldiers of tomorrow or something. Even with the aliens here I got a Starship Troopers vibe. Alas, this movie doesn't remotely come close to being a satire. Edge of Tomorrow has these things but they're just... there, like they were all one big MacGuffin, including the aliens. Sometimes I felt the movie doesn't do anything with this stuff. At least the action and characters kept me invested.\n\nHollywood should consider bringing back female action stars, someone who can hold a candle to Sigourney Weaver or Jamie Lee Curtis. We really haven't had that these past few years aside from Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games Saga. But we need someone who is determined and not just a ploy in politics, someone who is badass by nature. Rita was just that. This movie rocked because of her. I don't mind Cage once he gains traction (and again, some of his death scenes are hilarious) but I'd rather follow Rita, and the movie should have. The script could have done something with the whole war propaganda going on--it really makes me wonder the purpose other than hyping up the Rita character as the ultimate badass who needs a man in her life. I guess this was just male fantasy.\n\nWhen we find out more about Rita, my question remains: why wasn't she the star of this feature? Again, blame the source material. It's not Cruise's fault. Like I said, he plays his part well but in a movie where a guy is stuck in an infinite time loop and befriends a woman, you know how it'll turn out. There always needs to be a romance. She's the prize of male fantasies though romance would be last on her bucket list. Rita is here, ready to lead her men into battle, whip Tom Cruise into shape (or kill him), and slash through hordes of aliens. That's not to say Cage is a spectator in this movie like how Kick-Ass was in both of his movies. He started off as a coward but he becomes the action hero we expected from Tom Cruise. He grows despite how formulaic this character development is. Our leads are great and some of the supporting cast is memorable, like Bill Paxton, and I wished we got to know more about J Squad other than looking like a bunch of misfits. Brendan Gleeson was also great in his stubbornness. But why nearly ruin a great character like Rita with all this fluff?\n\nBoth director Doug Liman and the author of the original Manga from which this movie is based on simply took influence from video game mechanics to replicate the video gaming experience... and I can see that. Players get pissed off and hit the reset button or load up a previous save because nothing is going as planned. That's the obvious with showing Cage respawing but how the movie captures the feeling, the mood, the atmosphere, and overall presentation of a gaming experience is damn good.\n\nStory may be thin here but often I think the majority of gamers don't give a shit about story, not that we ever did in the first place (unless it was an RPG of some sort, or The Last of Us). Mario, a pudgy plumber, saves the princess from the evil King Koopa and has to fight turtles and goombas, and dodge Bullet Bills in the Mushroom Kingdom. We don't question the world or the enemies or the concept, it's just all there but not as MacGuffins like I criticized earlier. I dunno but it all just makes sense and we accept it. Unless someone fucks it up by attempting to explain everything like in that terrible Super Mario Bros. movie then it all falls apart. A lot of games, at least the older ones, didn't have much of a story and only gave us a simple goal: pass a level and advance. Sometimes you beat the game or you beat your high score (or someone else's). But you know the gaming experience, right? And this movie, daresay I, captures it perfectly.\n\nAt its simplest, the movie is just another Groundhog Day-esque type feature, and we already got one a few years back (the underrated Source Code, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan) but Edge of Tomorrow provided good action, good fun (seeing Tom Cruise get killed in various ways), an unnecessary-but-acceptable romance, and an interesting invasion story with an interesting enemy. If it wasn't for Doug Liman and co. acknowledging the video game mechanics, I'd simply say the movie was okay.\n\nFuck it. I'm calling it one of the year's best movies, but it still fumbles quite a bit. It has potential but I still feel they were either prematurely dismissed or not given much consideration at all just to make things as straight-forward as possible despite having a complex plot point. Yes, it still feels like one big MacGuffin starting from the moment Cage threatened to blackmail his general (this includes the Mimics and that one thing I consider a plot hole). I wanted to know more about J Squad but the movie doesn't give much but thank goodness for Bill Paxton. The romance was unnecessary. And dammit, I want Emily Blunt to be the star! But goddammit if it doesn't perfectly capture the video game experience that makes me almost willing to waive my nitpicks because that is the movie's strongest suit next to Blunt's character. Edge of Tomorrow breaks from being labeled as an okay sci-fi/action romantic comedy, it's a great video game movie, the best since Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010). \n\nOne final note: I'm a bit taken aback by the very last scene of this movie. As I'm thinking about it, I'm laughing like Donnie Darko. I guess that's all I can do.",

Entretenida e inspirada, esta pel\u00edcula dirigida por Doug Lima y protagonizada por Tom Cruise y Emily Blunt, esta basada en la novela japonesa \"All You Need Is Kill\" y nos narra la historia de un soldado desertor llamado William Cage, que es obligado a luchar en una guerra contra extraterrestres hostiles que quieren invadir el planeta, sin embargo, en el combate William Cage adquiere un curioso poder: repetir el mismo d\u00eda una y otra vez. Aunque la premisa parecer\u00eda repetitiva y una extra\u00f1a mezcla entre Al\u00eden, Halo y El D\u00eda de la Marmota, lo genial es que la historia funciona de maravilla. Esto gracias a la audaz direcci\u00f3n de Doug Lima, a sus editores y sobre todo al carisma de Tom Cruise (que hace lo que mejor sabe hacer), adem\u00e1s de lograr una gran qu\u00edmica con la hermosa y talentosa Emily Blunt.  De la misma manera los efectos visuales, la direcci\u00f3n de arte, el dise\u00f1o de sonido y la partitura de Christophe Beck funcionan a la perfecci\u00f3n, haciendo que el espectador se deje llevar por casi 2 horas y salir con una sonrisa. La cuarta aventura de Tom Cruise en la ciencia ficci\u00f3n es fresca, inteligente, divertida y sin pretensiones; un muy buen ejemplo de lo que las producciones veraniegas deben ser. A pesar de la mala fortuna que corri\u00f3 durante su exhibici\u00f3n, tiene todos los elementos para convertirse en un cl\u00e1sico con el paso del tiempo. La recomiendo ampliamente, \u00bfno la has visto? \u00bfqu\u00e9 esperas? te pierdes de algo muy entretenido.",

The story is great and the action scenes actually had me on the edge of my seat, rather than numbing my brain with an overload of CG imagery. As the film goes on the characters get a little farther along each time, much like playing a video game and getting better as you go. It's a fun style that never really gets old because of the great directing. Much like the film this one is being compared to, Groundhog Day, it could've gotten old fast, but the filmmakers make just the right adjustments right before you get tired of something to make it fun again.

            "content": "I personally enjoyed Edge of Tomorrow. Its pacing seems impeccable, riding the dialogue and action in a seamless effort to never lose the attention of the viewer, pulling the focus into the front seat and keeping them steadily but non-exhaustively anchored there till the end. \n\nThe action is by no means \"Transformers\" style-- and by that I mean it's not over the top or pervasive to the point where interest is lost or you find yourself start to laugh at the pars of impossibility and unbelievability as they shatter. The action here is used with high value, intention, and with an entertainment value that comes close to that of such Marvel films as The Avengers. \n\nTom Cruise has earned acclaim both from the controversies of his personal life regarding his Scientology beliefs, as well as his impressive efforts as a professional hollywood actor. His character, Officer Cage, is effective in every way you'd expect from Cruise. Starting out as the dubious, stuttering clown of an officer, to the transformed by the ways of war confidence of a soldier, Cruise is firm in the roots of who his character is and, does not for a moment, leave his believability untouched.\n\nEmily Blunt flawlessly makes the relationship dynamic work as Cruise's female lead when she enters the story as the film's last missing piece. Blunt and Cruise work well together without a dull moment. There's either laughter or there's action, and when there's neither, there's effective drama. I can't recall a moment in the film where it's either not funny, not important, and not attention-grabbing. I felt this similarly with Amazing-Spiderman 2, where the dialogue leads to the action, and the action satisfies because it makes sense. When the action is done, the dialogue redirects with an intention, back to the action, and the action satisfies once again. This cycle repeats until the credits role. It's quite a feat to the director, actors, and editor, to piece together a movie balancing out humor and entertaining action scenes without there becoming a blurred line somewhere in-between. But here, the balance is applause-worthy, and so is seeing the film for a second or maybe third time. \n\nThere are the side characters who help aid the humor from Cage and let it sail its sea. Brendan Gleesan portrays General Brighm as a stubborn, blunt general without an apology in the world. In contrast to the stuttering Cage in the opening scenes, this can be quite funny-- or very dry-- depending on your sense or humor and response to delivery. Bill Paxton's southern-sarcastic Master Sergeant Farell is a funny twist when placed with Cage as well, allowing their scenes to ride fluidly between action scenes. \n\nThese dialogue scenes are by no means an unnecessary boring mix to the rest of the film. The humor in these dialogue-driven scenes does not feel dragged out. Editor James Herbert makes sure of that, cutting out any fat that may have been left behind in the takes on set. Whether director Doug Liman intentionally called \"Cut\" on set before the humor became awkward, or James' cuts are simply done perfectly, these scenes do not make the movie feel longer. In fact, they are eloquently timed and placed in such a fashion that the film makes sense, is not taken too seriously, and also allows the action scenes to be driven out in full without any restraint. \n\nEdge of tomorrow is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language and brief suggestive material. The action scenes in this movie portray creatures (The \"Alpha's\", which are 100% CGI), that are violent, fast, and what they do might be disturbing for children to comprehend. Without giving too much away, there are moments, but one in particular, when a main character gets hit by something in combat, and what happens to them as a result is visually disturbing. Something like that out of The Rock (With Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery). There is one f-word expletive used but it is brief and somewhat cut off as the scene cuts at the last second. The suggestive material is nothing to really be concerned about, although children will get nothing out of it, it's nonetheless a sex joke that is not explicit or even crude, but simply funny. \n\nIf there's anything to complain about, it's a minor detail. I couldn't help but notice the slogan, \"Live. Die. Repeat.\" This directly describes in a very short paraphrase, what Scientology is about. So it's almost a joke on Cruise that he would star in a film practically selling his faith to the audience. Other than that minor hiccup, which is more of an annoyance or roll of the eyes than a film flaw, this film had me fairly impressed. \n\nOverall, I'd give Edge of Tomorrow a 4.5/5 stars.",

Cruise, the older he gets, the better  his performances get, and here I sit thinking he would never top 2004's Collateral, I've been proved wrong over and over.\n\nDirected by Doug Liman, who kickstarted the Bourne Franchise a long time ago, thrusts the same type of energy in this project.  The rapid cuts, the shaky cam, the similar protagonist to Bourne. The film adapted off a manga, named All You Need is Kill, which used to be the film's title, until changed to Edge of Tomorrow, takes place in the future, where extra terrestrials named mimics have taken over a chunk of the planet, near their plans of world domination.\n\nTom Cruise as Major William Cage (Another name that will only exist in movies.) a soldier on the R&D side of fighting the war gets shoved into fighting on the field. Given no choice, he chooses to fight on the battlefield, and in doing so, he gains the ability to reset the day, the catch? In order to reset the day, he must die everyday. Yikes. \n\nThe film follows William Cage's progression from a joke to an absolute beast. The cool editing makes that possible and adds a grand energy and comedic timing. One scene in particular is when Cage is being trained by Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a badass seasoned soldier who used to have the ability to reset the day. \n\nThe aliens need their power to reset the day back from Cage, as that's how the aliens were absolutely ravaging humanity. To stop that, Cage and Vrataski need to destroy the central hub. To give humans a chance and send the mimics packing.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Bill Paxton in one of his best roles to date, he legitimately seems to be having fun, and a stern Brendan Gleeson as a general, he fits that mold well too, Gleeson looks like a pretty stern person.\n\nShaky Cam is employed throughout most of the film, at the right times though, unlike Bourne Ultimatum, where even the conversations are shaking, there are however scenes in the film when characters speak are shot in handheld. Whereas the camera was shaking uncontrollably in Bourne, this is more of a quivering motion. So all is well. The dominant color schemes are Blue and Washed up Brown.  The interiors are blue and exteriors are brown, rightfully so, as most of the film takes place in a desert battlefield. \n\nDoug Liman makes all the right choices, editing wise, musically and scale.\nThere is no shortage of scale here, the film gets bigger with progression, it goes from desert, to the mountains all the way to the Louvre! It feels like a James Bond film mixed with Robocop. A true globetrotting adventure. Edge of Tomorrow, is the best film I have seen this year, and one of the best sci-fi adventures I have ever seen. Tom Cruise continues his awesome run of being an action here, after MI:4 and Jack Reacher. Emily Blunt  continues to amaze with her versatility and for Doug Liman, the Splinter Cell film sounds perfect as a follow up to this.\n\n5/5",

        {
            "content": "When the trailers for Edge of Tomorrow first appeared, they deceptively showcased a generic sci-fi blockbuster awash in a flood of similar fare with zippy names like Divergent or Transcendence. It didn't stand out. A friend quipped that someone should just invent a mech-suit so people don't have to keep making movies about them.\n\nI could see where he was coming from - we've seen it all before in Elysium (2013), Avatar (2009), District 9 (2009), The Matrix Revolutions (2003) and even Aliens (1986). Meanwhile, what appeared to be a sci-fi D-Day scene caused my brother to dismiss the film as Saving Private Ryan (1998) with aliens. This is absolutely true; there's no coincidence that Edge of Tomorrow was released the week of the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nSo it seems derivative, but it is surprisingly creative. It manages to bring the best of these elements together and successfully decant them into what is, after all, an original film. It's not a sequel to anything else, it's not part of a franchise, and that's always something to be happy about. It comes from director Doug Liman, who has directed many original action and sci-fi films, including The Bourne Identity (2002), Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) and Jumper (2008).\n\nAs suggested, the conflict is evocative of the world wars (including both the D-Day landings and references to a decisive battle at Verdun) with a futuristic twist. An alien menace has decimated Europe and is poised to invade the United Kingdom, and we're thrown into the action on the eve of the last desperate attempt by NATO to push back into France.\n\nTom Cruise stars as Major William Cage, showing us once again that he still knows how to star in a blockbuster. Cage is not a real soldier; he's a PR man who thinks he's there to sell the war to the public. He begins with typical Cruise charm and confidence, which then shatters when he's sent to the front line by NATO commander General Brigham (Brendon Gleeson, the first we see of the film's solid supporting cast).\n\nHe ends up in a squad of oddballs (squadballs?) under Master Sergeant Farrell (Bill Paxton, who was in Aliens). Everyone has mech-suits, because it's the future and it's cool. Cage can barely operate his, and swiftly ends up on the receiving end of an alien mandible. The alien special effects are high quality; they are scary, inhuman and move smoothly but unpredictably.\n\nBut it's not all over, he's entered a time loop, which resets to the night before the battle each time Cage is killed in action, which he is, again and again. Ultimately, he is able to use this ability to turn the tide of the battle and the war by incrementally improving each day, both by developing his skills and finding out how to beat the aliens.\n\nHowever, he couldn't do a thing without Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who was doing the same thing until she lost the ability. She's a believably hardened veteran, and a hyper-competent warrior compared to the initially bumbling Cage. Though Cruise is the star, she takes the lead in the developing relationship between the two characters, even if he has to meet her for the first time every day.\n\nThe time loop inevitably draws comparisons further potential source material, in this case the classic Groundhog Day (1994). It's also evocative of playing a video game; loading from a previous save point and attempting to beat the same impossible level over and over.\n\nThe film plays off the natural humour created by such a scenario, but it is often very dark, as Cage must die each time to reset the loop. Yet the humour works well and is perfectly balanced with the action and desperation of the larger campaign.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow is based on a popular Japanese novella called All You Need is Kill, and some of the aesthetics, including the mech-suits and Vrataski's impossibly huge sword evoke this origin. There's another nod when the incompetent Cage gets his suit's language stuck in Japanese.\n\nIndeed, it is a global film, not just the American affair featuring Tom Cruise that it might have been. There are plenty of European actors, including Blunt, Gleeson and many of Cage's squad. The opening sets the scene quickly with a composite of BBC News footage, and the film is exclusively set in England and France, with deserted, destroyed and military occupied scenes of London and Paris among the most powerful.\n\nCage's character development is an excellent deconstruction of what we expect from Cruise as an actor. He starts out with a confidence built on cowardice, but is thrown completely out of his comfort zone. Over the rest of the film, the character works hard to attain a typical Tom Cruise level of action hero, which he doesn't attain until the climax.",

As a glutton for the gaming industry, I still had issues going into the the film on how they could translate the excitement of spending hours trying to bypass only a few obstacles that most halo players (or any other shooter) are well experienced dealing with.\n\nThat being said the director and his team succeeded. \n\nWith each reincarnation, the audience groaned with the hero, jumped when he (yet again) saved a favorite player, and lastly, laughed when he would make a rookie mistake and have to try again.\n\nEmily blunt leads this superb action extravaganza,  with her harder than nails persona. The best review (and ultimately the one that persuaded me to see the flick) pointed out the joy of seeing her murder tom cruise, again, again, and again. She is not running around in stilettos nor in an uncomfortable love triangle, but  instead gives one of the best action experiences I've ever experienced. Kudos to her and women in film!\n\nEnd of the day, it's worth the \"Tom Cruise\" risk. This film isn't about him. It's about her. And this spectacular isn't meant to be seen at home.",

            "content": "3.0/4.0\r\n\r\nIn another summer of sequels, spinoffs, remakes and modern literary adaptations comes \"Edge of Tomorrow\", an original and immensely entertaining sci-fi flick that reassures Tom Cruise's status as one of the best and biggest action movie stars around. Yes, the movie's central premise is in a way a rehash of \"Groundhog Day\" and is based on the Japanese light novel \"All You Need Is Kill\" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka but there is no denying its original spin. In the wrong hands, the movie could have only hinged its central idea but Cruise as a man having to relive the same day over and over and getting to convince people around him is something to behold. There is also a surprisingly good amount of humor that Cruise thoroughly delivers thanks to a script written by Christopher McQuarrie (\"The Usual Suspects\") along with two others.\r\n\r\nSet in the future where the world is facing an alien invasion from so-called \"Mimics\", Cruise stars as Major William Cage, a US army PR officer who gets to forcibly join a major battle on the beaches of France by a rough army general (Brendan Gleeson) using new Robocop-like suits that are believed to be the weapons against the aliens. The battle is lost before the troops even land but through a very unique alien encounter Cage gets to relive the last 24 hours of his life over and over again. While on the beach he meets Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a renowned soldier and hero and they try to work out a way to defeat the Mimics. \r\n\r\nThe movie is big and loud in a good way and is a solid return to form for director Doug Liman (\"The Bourne Identity\").  It is also very well executed with solid visual effects (the beach battle sequence is reminiscent of the opening sequence in \"Saving Private Ryan\" in a good way. The chemistry between Cruise and Blunt is undeniable with Blunt like you have never seen her before as a hard-ass action goddess. The love story aspect is unexpected but works very well.  Gleeson is also good and so is Bill Paxton as a rough master sergeant who leads the platoon Cruise's character is assigned to. It is best to watch the movie with little knowledge of the details and see it unravel (the ads are wise enough to not reveal too much). The movie loses some momentum in its final act when all is said and done but it is still well worth the watch.",

This isn't the first time I've had to post this review but that's because you're stubborn. You won't believe me when I tell you how awesome this film is. You won't believe me when I tell you the advertising campaign did it no justice. You won't even care that it's virtually the only semi-original movie within this summer blockbuster season so far. You're still going to say you're tired of Tom Cruise and that EDGE OF TOMORROW just looks like an OBLIVION retread. No matter how many times or in how many ways I recommend EDGE OF TOMORROW you always refuse to believe the film is any good. But this time, please, bear with me while I tell you this story. It will sound ridiculous at first but the longer I talk the more rational it's going to appear...\n\nIn the year whatever a bunch of aliens called 'mimics' attack Earth, having invaded most of Europe. The U.S army's public relations officer, Major William Cage (Cruise), is summoned to London to join the front line on the beaches of France. Cage refuses, admitting quite smugly that he's merely a hack sales man good at putting a positive spin on the war but can't even stand the sight of blood let alone engage in battle. When Cage's attempt to blackmail the general that signs him up (Brendan Gleeson) doesn't go as expected he finds himself knocked out on a military base camp in London Heathrow the following day, demoted to 'private' rank and bossed about by a moustached sergeant (Bill Paxton). Shortly after, Cage does battle on a French beach where he and his squad are killed almost instantly only for Cage to awaken alive and well at Heathrow again... and then things get weird. Or more specifically, things get GROUNDHOG DAY. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), the so-called 'Angel of Verdun' and poster child for the war due to her heroism in a previous mimic battle, is the only one that believes Cage and together they use his condition to their advantage to end the war.\n\nYes, at one point I was sick of him too. After leaving the theatre in tears on multiple occasions having watched this wonderful actor squander his talent on yet more sci-fi actiony nonsense I told myself I was done. Turns out Mr Cruise is a very hard person to stay mad at so I went into EDGE OF TOMORROW (whilst hating myself) with managed expectations and was pleasantly surprised. EDGE OF TOMORROW is nothing like its weak-ass marketing campaign would have you believe. For one thing, Tom Cruise's character is not a badass at all but an incompetent, cowardly little weasel who does everything he possibly can to get out of battle before he's dragged into it kicking and screaming. Yes, Cruise does ride a motorcycle at some point but that's not until much, much later after tons of character development. Speaking of which, part of the fun is witnessing Cage grow into a man who is courageous, strong and determined. And if all the heroic montages don't leave you rooting for Cage then at least you get to see Tom Cruise die a lot.\n\nEDGE OF TOMORROW isn't a reboot, remake or sequel but is derivative of many sci-fi films like PACIFIC RIM and even video games like GEARS OF WAR and FALLOUT. Its premise alone pays homage to the movie I mentioned in my synopsis but it's the way the premise is handled that sadly the trailers don't get across: EDGE OF TOMORROW is hilarious. You'd think watching the main protagonist relive the same day over and over again would test my patience but the gag just never gets old. The complete and utter fail of Cage's first few attempts to sneak off and/or deal with the other soldiers or even just watching Rita shoot Cage when he gets severely crippled and/or compromised become increasingly hysterical and Cruise sells it with his excellent comic timing. Director Doug Liman (THE BOURNE IDENTITY) edits the loops in a way that serves the humour whilst making sure we don't grow as frustrated as the main character does. We get to see the cause and effect of Cage's actions in a non-linear fashion and there are sequences we, the audience, witness for the first time even though it's clear he has been through it several times already. Sometimes Cage gets so bored of repeating the same day he takes a break from the mission altogether and escapes to the pub! Liman milks this premise for all its worth and it's clear he's having a blast with it.\n\nThe battle sequences are well done as is expected from the director who kicked off THE BOURNE IDENTITY plus Cruise has always been excellent with his stunts. The biggest surprise where action is concerned actually comes from Emily Blunt. Not only is her character a badass but her being a badass within the context of the narrative is very realistic. You see this wee framed woman and you don't automatically think she could earn the title of 'Full Metal Bitch' (as she's called in the movie) but when you find out the real reason why it makes perfect sense. Blunt has great chemistry with Cruise and isn't just his arm candy like most of the women in his films are. \nOn an aesthetic level, the movie feels very gritty and earthy to me in a lot of ways and part of that is from the familiar locational setting. As a Londoner, I must admit the River Thames making an appearance filled my heart with glee and I will now be looking out for tentacled monsters in the water each time I stroll down there.  But another reason why this universe felt so grounded was because it pretty much reflected the real world today in terms of technology. There were no clich\u00e9d holographic computers or transparent, electronic pieces of paper where the writing moves up and down as it's downloaded or any superfluous elements that typically don't serve a purpose other than to say it exists. This is a trap that a lot of sci-fi flicks fall into.  The only advanced technology in EDGE OF TOMORROW is simply developed in direct response to the alien invasion and that's the battle suits. I kind of loved that the suits seemed dumb and impractical initially but as Cage learns to use it better you realise how awesome the suits are.  The aliens also look great and I liked the sloppy and frenetic way in which they manoeuvred.\n\nOnce all the jokes are played out Liman relies on urgency and suspense to carry the last third of the movie.  The stakes rise tremendously and there's a general feeling of dread that makes you realise you've been taking Cage's new found power for granted up until this point. Unfortunately, this brings me to my only problem with the movie: the ending. The conclusion is a disappointing Hollywood cop-out that ultimately doesn't make sense and just seems like a cynical ploy to leave room for sequels. Liman also gives into another Hollywood clich\u00e9 with regards to where the main characters' relationship goes - which is fine but it's nonsensical considering who initiates it and at what particular time. Obviously, this is a time loop flick so there is a lot you'll have to just 'accept' otherwise the gaps in logic will eat away at you but yeah, these two things were the least forgiveable.\n\nThankfully, the 2 hours that come before is so good ultimately the ending shouldn't affect the overall enjoyment of the film too much. EDGE OF TOMORROW is a thrilling theatre going experience that fires on all cylinders and will take you on a ride of emotions throughout. It uses humour to play with the concept of time which is only made possible by the stellar performances from Cruise and Blunt and some clever editing that ensures the gimmick never wears out its welcome. Its sci-fi elements are well realised whilst being grounded and never heavy-handed. It is simply tragic that people won't see this film in cinema but I hope I've done a good job of convincing you (this time) before it's too late. Don't let a bad marketing campaign and an annoying celebrity personality cheat you out of seeing one of the best films of the summer.\n\nMore @ http://cartoonsarebetterthanreallife.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Tom Cruise. Yes, Tom Cruise. Most filmgoers and the general public see him as a bat-shit Scientologist who uses L. Ron Hubbard's belief system to condone acts of craziness and manifest destiny. But, the man, after nearly four decades in the business, is still a credible actor and more than holds his own in the genre (sci-fi) that has recently re-ignited his career. After a slew of misfires in recent years (Ghost Protocol notwithstanding), Cruise finally lands himself a juicy, comedic and fairly inspired part and premise that gets a lot of traction out of an unexpected adventure and cool gimmick. Set in a near future where countries have been lumped into factions and we are on the losing side of an uphill battle against creatures that hold the power to anticipate our moves on the battlefield and can reset time to influence the outcome of the war in their favor, Cruise's character is a Major, stripped of his rank at the last minute who joins a motley band of Privates at a drop-zone every day to die and repeat the process until he can get far enough to possibly win. This set up makes for some rousing set pieces, bits of humor and winks and nods to other sci-fi films of yore, as well as some great chemistry between Cruise and his leading lady Blunt who exudes sexiness and rapid-fire delivery in every scene. Turns from Bill Paxton as a nutjob Master Sergeant who finds himself perplexed at Cruise's in-depth knowledge of the operation after only seemingly meeting him one time (when in Cruise's reality 300 + times), he chews scenes. Doug Liman, as director, hasn't had this strong of a showing since The Bourne Identity and he infuses the film with an exciting and witty pace. However, toward film's end, it gets a little cumbersome and you can tell the gimmick has warn out its welcome. Still, at least the first 3 acts are a dizzyingly awesome ride that is well-worth the price of admission. Check it out :)",

What stands out about the film is the story, which is finely crafted, exciting, captivating and memorable. Add to that a solid cast of actors that elevate the film's ideas, and you have of the most exciting action packed thrill rides in the last few years. Edge of Tomorrow is a thrilling, action packed picture, one that will grab your attention from the first frame onwards. Tom Cruise is a great choice to play the lead character, and what makes the film really worth your time is the fact that it uses a fairly simple concept, but due to its strong performances, and immaculate direction, Edge of Tomorrow is one of the finest genre films that I have seen in quite some time. The film is action packed, never dull or tedious, and with a well crafted story and futuresque vibe the film possesses, this picture succeeds on many levels as a brilliant piece of entertainment, and above all, it features Tom Cruise in a fine role that feels like it was tailored for him, and it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. I felt that Edge of Tomorrow was one of 2014's finest action films, and with director Doug Liman who previously helmed The Bourne Identity, I have to say this is his best work since that film. He's made other films of course, but none have had the power of really grabbing your attention like the first Bourne film. Until now. With a fine blend of action and Science Fiction, Edge of Tomorrow is a memorable and constantly thrilling piece of cinema that is a must watch for anyone looking for top notch thrills. I highly recommend this film, and if you enjoy films such as District 9 and Elysium, you're surely going to enjoy this film. Edge of Tomorrow is one of 2014's very best action films.",

Yet they played the same day over and over again, the movie had not made it annoying or boring. It had been new and intense the whole way, and I also liked the idea of one of Tom Cruise's character having to train before battle, usually he just knows what to do.

I'm also provided a seemingly well calculated dosage of information and imagery that the director clearly lays out in a meticulous manner so I can do my own analysis and problem solving. This film actually empowers and stimulates my thought process, in a similar way that playing a challenging video game or developing a piece of software does. Aside from mind-blown, I'm left intellectually and creatively aroused. I actually end up with some ideas needing clarification or verification after watching it the first time, motivating me to play the movie one more time.

            "content": "Hey again. If you'd like to see this review in blog format, with pictures and all sorts of fancy junk, you can check it out here: http://mps-marvelous-movie-reviews.blogspot.ie/2014/07/edge-of-tomorrow-review.html\r\n\r\nOr you can read it here as always.\r\n\r\nEdge of Tomorrow is the success story of this year's summer movie season, and perhaps the year in cinema. Opening in competition with hotly-anticipated cancer-flick The Fault in Our Stars, and following up box-office behemoths like Captain America: The Winter Soldier and X-Men: Days of Future Past, it appeared as though Edge of Tomorrow was all set for martyrdom and eventual cult status. Strong word of mouth, however, gave the film great legs at box office, and has gone on to become one of the highest-grossing films of the year. That might be one of the most profound votes of confidence in the movie-going public we've seen in years. What's that you say? Transformers 4 opened with $100 million in America alone? Well, never mind, then...\r\n\r\nAll negativity aside, Edge of Tomorrow is one of the most entertaining, original sci-fi films in years. And while the time-loop premise does beg comparisons to the smaller scale Source Code (which is superior), Edge of Tomorrow stands on it's own as an exhilarating, surprisingly smart sci-fi actioner. Praise has to be attributed to the tight, funny script by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth, and Doug Liman's fast-paced, punchy directorial style (he is an alumnus of the Bourne series, after all), but it really comes down to the huge charisma of Tom Cruise in the lead role, ably supported by a small but effective supporting cast.\r\n\r\nCruise plays Major William Cage, a marketing shill for the army who finds himself on the front line in the attack on an alien race that has seized most of central Europe. After a skirmish with an alien that leads to his death, Cage finds that he is waking up at the start of the day each time he dies. From here, Cage goes on a journey to discover just why this is happening, and whether it can be used to win the battle against the alien forces.\r\n\r\nWhat Edge of Tomorrow crucially gets right is it's premise. A film about a soldier fighting the same battle over and over again has the capacity to be an obnoxious explosion-fest as many lazy cash cow franchises often are this time of year. Or worse, it could just bore it's audience to tears with a meandering, needlessly repetitive plot device. Luckily, director Doug Liman has storytelling talent enough to keep the film moving along at a smart pace, allowing enough room for character development among the generally well-executed action. While the film is guilty of sagging in it's opening stages, and again near the climax, the combined charms of stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt and the effective humour of it's fresh script keeps audiences engaged for it's 113 minute running time.\r\n\r\nIt's Cruise who continually shines throughout the film however. As Cage, he gets to embrace the kind of light-hearted performance he usually avoids (save for his show-stealing turn in Tropic Thunder). He keeps the audience invested even as the film drags through a few of the typical science fiction clich\u00e9s we've come to expect of the genre. Emily Blunt, too, makes up for her disappointing performance in 2012's Looper. Her portrayal of Vrataski has a surprising depth, as the character is more well-written the usual female companion character. When the film occasionally switches to Vrataski's viewpoint, it allows Liman to toy knowingly with viewer expectations, and showcases Blunt's unexpected talent in action.\r\n\r\nWhile the vocal fans of the film may mislead you, it does have a few glaring flaws, not the least of which is the lack of steam it has by it's end. As Cage repeats the day and battle again and again, Liman never seems to run short of interesting and often hilarious ways to present Cage and combat. However, when it comes time to wrap the film up, Liman resorts to some unfortunately standard action set pieces and little of the dynamic, zippy action from earlier in the film are to be found. The climax of the film itself leaves little impression, and lacks the same inventive touch of the rest of the film.\r\n\r\nAside from those flaws with the action, and a few pacing issues within that climax, Edge of Tomorrow lives up to the hype, as Doug Liman delivers an engaging blockbuster that trades off any truly memorable action in favour of a well-written, very well-acted sci-fi film with much more brains than it's contemporaries. While the box office results were lacking, and the film has a much better second act than a third, Edge of Tomorrow proves that there is life in original science fiction, and that Tom Cruise, at over 50 years of age, still has the chops to carry a film wearing a robotic battle suit.\r\n\r\nEdge of Tomorrow gets a 9/10.",

But on the other hand, i also knew how bad the most potential good movies in the past ended up. \n\nI was scared that they'd f**k it up and just give us another 'Oblivion' with a bad story, dull characters and dumb-ass plot twists. So, finally, i went in the theater with mixed feelings. But then, right from the beginning, i knew it would be fantastic. The first minutes really hooked me and i found myself watching a very intelligent and super fun film.\n\nYou had the feeling like you were directly in it and you really feel with Tom Cruise from the beginning to the end. I don't like Tom Cruise in general, but this role just fits him like a fist in the eye. Nobody who sees this movie could deny it. This represents the first time Cruise has portrayed a yellow-bellied wuss. He goes from being a coward to a hero in an arc that is as entertaining as the film is exciting. From minute to minute i was more and more in this fantastic story and wanted it to last forever. But eventually it was over and i was really satisfied with everything. ??\n\nTwo main characters (Cruise and the excellent Emily \"Full Metal Bitch\" Blunt) who played perfectly, a fascinating story well told and really fast and good looking action made it for me the best movie i've seen in a while. The story is well told and there are no boring repeatings. Also, the action never goes into that overblown mode where your senses get tired and you just don't care anymore (ahem Transformers...). Well done, Doug Liman!\n\nIf you're thinking 'Edge of Tomorrow' sounds like a science fiction mash-up of 'Groundhog Day' with 'Starship Troopers', you're not far off-base. Although the concept has been re-visited a few times, the movie succeeds in creating something fresh and entertaining. This is accomplished through a great cast, some humorous moments, and action that keeps the story moving forward at a smooth stride. Go see it!",

            "content": "Edge Of Tomorrow is a completely derivative yet, actually pretty enjoyable Sci-Fi/Action flick starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. The film is based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's Manga All You Need Is Kill and tells the story of a not too distant future where an alien invasion force has landed and taken a strong foothold in Europe. The beings called 'mimics' seem to anticipate the united armed forces' every move until a victory in Verdun, France, led by Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), gives the Earth a glimmer of hope that the enemy can be defeated. A U.S. military PR man Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is brought in to sell the world... though not sure why the world would need to be 'sold' when the situation is so dire... on a massive armed attack on the beaches of France by covering the attack from the front-lines to which the cowardly Cage protests and even tries to blackmail his way out of. This gets him arrested and busted down to foot soldier to now to join the invasion in actual combat... where he is killed within minutes. But, Cage wakes up from death the morning before when first being sent to his new squad and relives the day till being killed again... only to awaken 24 hours earlier once more. With full memory of the previous days, he gets better and better at staying alive until he runs into Sgt. Vrataski who knows what's going on... it's happened to her too! His encounter with the blood of a special alien drone known as an 'Alpha' has given Cage the alien ability to re-set time and now teamed up with \"The Angel Of Verdun\" Cage must keep dying till the two successfully destroy the hidden alien power source and stop the enemy before all is lost. But, the re-set power is not permanent and one of Cage's deaths could be his last... if his own forces don't lock him and Vrataski up for being crazy first.\n\nSure this flick is a Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Battle: Los Angeles, and Aliens thrown in a blender with a bunch of other movies but, under Doug Liman's direction it's actually a lot of action-packed fun. The action is staged well and the film moves at a good, steady pace and really avoids becoming the mess it could have been with such a convoluted story. The SPFX are flawless and while the design of the film gives us little new, it is suspenseful and has enough of a sense of humor about itself to get past any familiarity. We also get some likable characters to become endeared to and they are well cast. Sure we may not like the cowardly Cage early on but, the more he grows as a soldier and a person the more we like him and are right there with him when he graduates to full blown hero. The time travel elements are also kept pretty basic and while there are always questions when time travel is concerned, Edge keeps the glaring problems to a minimum by not getting too over enthusiastic with it's use and while certain story elements will fold under too much scrutiny, the film moves fast enough to keep you from thinking too much about it. Liman also gives us some intensity but, keeps the tone of the film from getting too dark and the mix blends just right to keep things on an entertaining level. The script by Christopher McQuarrie and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth never gets too complicated and is smart enough to change up the formula about half way through to avoid predictability or monotony even though we still have a good idea how things will work out. The only real stand-out flaw is a an ending that is a little too neat and convenient in order to keep this flick a crowd-pleaser but, it's not bad enough to not go along with it or, seriously hurt the movie.\n\nA big plus is a good cast that perfectly understand the material. Cruise has fun playing a sniveling coward for a while before transforming more into the action hero he is renown for. And once that happens he is as solid as always. Blunt is obviously enjoying being able to play such a badass but, one that doesn't loose her humanity or femininity. Vrataski is tough but, very likable and sexy and we certainly wouldn't mind a post battle celebration in her bunk after the war. We also have fan favorite Bill Paxton as a scenery chewing Southern Master Sergeant who leads Cruise's platoon of misfits into battle over and over and refuses to believe him when Cage has said he's done this before.... which leads to another small peeve, that in such a dire situation and despite how much foresight Cruise's Cage seems to have, no one ever gives him or Vrataski even the slightest benefit of the doubt that they can end the war and defeat the invaders. No matter how much info they seem to know, they are completely dismissed. True, it's a far fetched story but, the world is about to be lost you'd think someone would at least entertain their notions except for his oddball platoon, who are the ones least likely to believe him... especially when they have a physicist to back them up... but, even the physicist is cast aside despite his wealth of knowledge. Makes no sense.\n\nBut, despite it's flaws and being basically a mash-up of things we've already seen, Edge Of Tomorrow is an entertaining 113 minutes and was far more satisfying then expected. Go in not expecting much and you might actually come out surprised and having had a good time. A fun Summer movie.",

            "content": "[7/2/14] Tom Cruise (?) stars in an action film that plays out like a video game, looks like a video game, but delivers the goods without feeling forced or 'too explosive.' It's basically two hours of Tom Cruise getting killed at point B and respawning at point A, BUT with direction--a reason to keep watching the revival process. The script is funny, driven (meaning that the whole respawn ability isn't without purpose), nicely-acted [especially Tom Cruise' performance), and the action sequences are pretty cool. Want details? Watch \"Edge of Tomorrow\" while it's still being played. Overall: I'd say the film is a solid 4 out of 5 and I do mean solid...about as hard as my D, uhhh, nevermind  I can say this much; Transformers 4 (which I haven't seen but I've sat through enough of those movies to know what to expect) ain't got shit on this one [the sad part is that most people are attracted to mindless action and clumsy writing--both of which are absent in \"Edge of Tomorrow\"].\nUpdate:\n[12/28/14] I stand by what I said in my original review (see above), however, I'm going to raise the 4-star rating to a 5-star rating. Here's why, \"Edge of Tomorrow\"--now marketed as \"Live. Die. Repeat\" (which is a WAY better title in my opinion)--really does make the respawn aspect work heavily in its favor. Rather than showing us each scene over and over again, the director chooses to omit some things and include others so that each revival feels different. For instance, when Tom Cruise's unit comes looking for him and Tom's character says \"not today, guys.\" It's clear that this segment has happened many, many times before--we, the audience, have simply never seen it until this point. Another example would be when Cruise and Emily Blunt confront General Brigham, which they'd done on many attempts [even Tom tells the general that they've met before]--yes, Cruise's acting is excellent--but there's also a part in that scene where Tom admits that he and Blunt have never gone that far. That sort of \"have they done this before or not\" works amazingly, far more than I gave it credit for in my first viewing of the film. I'll just add that I bought this on Black Friday last month for $7.99 on Blu-Ray--I'm very happy about that.",

            "content": "Tom Cruise returns to old form\n\nLet's be honest, Tom Cruise's last entertaining part was in 2008's \"Tropic Thunder\" as Les Grossman.  The young man, who introduced himself to us in the 1980s with films like \"Taps\" and \"Risky Business\", has grown up right before our eyes, both physically and professionally.  By 1986, he reached the highest watermark any Hollywood movie star could aspire to, flying F-14 Tomcats in the mega-blockbuster hit \"Top Gun\".  As an established box office sensation, Cruise then cemented himself to dramatic roles in such films as \"Rain Man,\" \"Born on the Fourth of July\" and \"A Few Good Men\"-diversifying his acting portfolio with meatier leading roles.  \n\nIt wasn't until the inaugural \"Mission: Impossible\" film in 1996, that Cruise really began to jump at the opportunity to play action-packed heroes in Hollywood, perhaps attempting to become the next Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise forever linked Cruise to action movies, effortlessly discarding his many other acting talents to the side in a heaping ball of flames.\n\nThe truth is that Cruise is too good of an actor for directors to hide his theatric skills in action-packed thrillers.  Cruise's best films are when he's the most vulnerable with a compelling story to tell.  His efforts in \"Magnolia\", \"Jerry Maguire\" or \"The Last Samurai\" all prove that.  But his lackadaisical \"Collateral\" (2004) and \"War of the Worlds\" (2005) played like mid-life crisis films, desperate productions that only highlighted Cruise's pigeonholed genre of mindless action thrillers.   \n\nIn \"Edge of Tomorrow\", Cruise regains his lost film mojo and delivers his best leading actor performance in over a decade.  He plays Major William Cage, a public affairs desk warrior assigned to the front lines to fight an alien species.  Costarring, and perhaps most responsible for Cruise's outstanding work in this film, is the talented and well-cast Emily Blunt as Cruise's Special Forces sidekick.  Together, they make a formidable force in this sci-fi thriller-with Blunt easily the deadlier of the two.\nDirector Doug Liman (\"Swingers\", 1996) creates a time loop saga that will have audiences making the easy comparison to \"Groundhog Day\" (1993) for its repeated reliving of the day's events over and over.  Likewise, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" garners quick resemblance to the alien battles in 1997's \"Starship Troopers\", with the fate of the planet resting on the outcome of the war.  Liman's \"Edge of Tomorrow\" narrowly avoids replaying the opening scene one too many times.  It's obvious that all his efforts in the film were focused on these repeated, yet compelling, time shenanigans versus developing a thoughtful movie conclusion.\n\nThe good acting in \"Edge of Tomorrow\" by Cruise and Blunt overcomes a weak script and an anticlimactic finish.  In fact, the relationship between Cruise and Blunt holds this film together long enough for viewers to give it a solid grade and come away satisfied.  The first hour of the movie is fascinating with the use of the time loop and affords Cruise many opportunities to appear vulnerable, weak and timid...showcasing several layers to his evolving character.  The second half of the film, unfortunately, dissolves into a less thought-out finale prompted by a lack of investment and caring from moviegoers into the outcome of the battle.  Once the time loop is closed and Cruise's work over with Blunt's deadly Rita Vrataski, viewers will be thankful the ordeal and film have concluded.  But not before realizing that the Tom Cruise of old is back.  And that's good news.\n\nGrade: B",

            "content": "\"They say we're young and we don't know.  Won't find out unit-ii-l we grow.\"   This line of Sonny and Cher immediately takes me back to Bill Murray waking up over and over again in the classic \"Groundhog Day\".  Similarly the words \"On your feet, maggot!\" gouge themselves into your brain in Tom Cruise's latest blockbuster Edge of Tomorrow.  \n\nBased on the novel \"All you need is kill\", which was the original shooting title of the film, Cruise plays a really interesting character - William Cage - who begins the film as a cowardly and conniving army media man before circumstances force him to progressively step up find the hero inside himself.   The Europe  of the not too distant future has been invaded by a bizarre alien life form - the Mimics:  a hive like being that breeds like rabbits and quickly overruns the whole of mainland Europe.  Clearly UKIP must have got into power by then and shut the Channel Tunnel, since the alien invaders have not yet conquered Britain which stands alone against the enemy.  \n\nThe infantry of the allied forces fight in well-armed mechanised suits, and Cage - much against his will - is strapped into one of these devices and 'parachuted' into the front line on the Normandy beaches:  It is rather ironic that I watched this film on the 70th anniversary of when our brave troops did the same thing.  \n\nWhy an aerial invasion would choose to land on the open beaches rather than some nice leafy field more inland is a question perhaps best not dwelt on, but it wouldn't make any difference anyway:  unfortunately, the Mimics can manipulate time and they already know the allied forces are coming, resulting in a massacre.   Cruise is killed and the film ends.  Or rather no, actually it doesn't.  From the result of a nice plot twist (no spoilers), Cruise reawakens at the start of the same day and can escape the death that befell him, at least for a little while longer.   And so it goes on living up for once to the movie's catchy tag-line - \"Live, Die, Repeat\".   As this proceeds, Cage appears, to his fellow comrades, to have almost God-like powers of combat through stunning demonstrations of intuition.  I was reminded again of what Bill Murray's Phil Connors says in \"Groundhog Day\":  \"Well maybe the *real* God uses tricks, you know? Maybe he's not omnipotent. He's just been around so long he knows everything.\"    \n\nCage teams up with legendary fighter Rita, also known as the Angel of Verdun, played by the wonderful Emily Blunt.   Rita is the only person to believe in Cage's powers, the reason being (already unnecessarily pre-spoiled via the trailer) that she used to have the same power but lost it.  Together they must find a way to dual-handedly end the war.\n\nThis is a great, albeit not flawless, film.  Directed by Doug Limon, of the Bourne films, the pace is non-stop and the story infused with enough thrills, action and humour to thoroughly entertain over its running time, which (and a common complaint from this critic) is pleasingly under 2 hours.   Cruise is a star that drives Marmite-like love and hate reactions.   And so this is a film that has something for everyone:  for the lovers of the diminutive action figure, Cruise is in great form and revels in the chance to step up to what must have been a physically exhausting shoot.  For haters of the guy, they get to see him die on stage -  - repeatedly!   Emily Blunt also shines in her role, and the fledgling, almost reluctant, romance that builds between the two characters is well played.   All of the supporting cast, especially the assorted grizzled characters of Cage's J-troop, add variety and depth to the story.  \n\nThe special effects are first rate, with the evil Mimics appearing truly threatening as they emerge suddenly from hiding places under the ground:  something perhaps to bear in mind and pre-brief on if you have younger children you want to take.   \n\nThis is very nearly a five-Fad film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  As with any time-travel related film, there are some plot holes that appear when you pick under the skin of the story.  This is particularly true of Emily Blunt's character.  And the Hollywood ending of the film is rather unsatisfactory and not terribly logical in keeping with the excellence of the rest of the story.  But overall this is a film worth you catching at the cinema.  A thoroughly good night out.\n\n(If you enjoyed this review please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to \"Follow the Fad\").",

Tom Cruise who goes by the name Cage is finding himself waking up time after time reliving his day all over again with a pretty female who is a combat animal who ends up being his sidekick training him to fight the aliens who is ambushing our so called sneak attack which the aliens are already in position to disperse and take out our entire army of super soldiers. The video game theory is just the same as you playing a game and each time you are killed you remember what caused you to die so the next time you play you remember that wrong move that got you killed the previous time and you just get better and better each time you play, yeah that's the movie but the writers kept it entertaining and not to predictable.

Then human fight back and win a battle with the creation of exo suit. Then the aliens retaliate and win back. Tom Cruise is a Major in non-combat unit, recruiting soldiers. Commander Brendan Gleeson want him to join the frontline battle in France to boost the morale but Tom who never fight before refuse. He is caught and fainted. When he wake up he is in the camp. Bill Paxton brief him through, having the info he is a rogue soldier pretending to be an officer. He is introduce to J squad. Tom doesn't know how to arm the guns. Onboard the plane about to parachute down, the plane is hit and he landed safely. Going to the battlefield, Tom is overwhelm. \"Full Metal Bitch\" Emily Blunt save Tom but was killed immediately. Tom come face to face an alien and he manage to kill it but he also die from the attack. Then he awaken again in the same base, same scenario for everything. Go to the frontline again, Tom save Emily and tell her his story. She tell him to find her in the base next time and he die again. Tom begin to know he somehow keep dying and relive the same moment he wake up in the base. He pretend to get punish and sneak away to find Emily. She bring him to see Noah Taylor who is a professor. Emily told Tom she use to have his power of reliving after death. But lost the power after a blood transfusion. She will train him up to fight and everytime they go to battlefield, he must remember every detail and attack to advance forward for the ultimate mission - to find the Omega alien which control the other alien. Tom killed the Alpha alien and the blood fuse with Tom. The alien have the power to relive the past and that's how they test the mankind capability and win the war again. He also must wait for a vision in order to know where Omega is hiding. Tom train hard daily under Emily and go to battlefield, learning more detail. Whenever he is injured, Emily kill him. Tom get a vision of Omega hiding in a dam. Noah search and pinpoint it to Germany. Tom and Emily advance all the way. She is injured and they hide in a house. She want to take the helicopter but Tom is skeptical. They have actually been through this stage many times and whenever she start the helicopter, an alien will attack and kill her. Tom is reluctant because he tried many things but still unable to save her. She go ahead and is killed. Tom decide to go ahead on his own. An Alpha injures Tom, making him bleed. The Omega isn't there at all. Tom manage to escape and kill himself. Relive again,  Tom says there's no way the idea will succeed. Noah invented a probe that can link to Omega but his project is shelved. Tom and Emily try their luck to find Brendan who keep the probe. Again they've been through this many times and he always don't believe the duo. Tom predictably tell him everything that's gonna happen and Brendan sort of buy it and pass the probe to him but off course place them under arrest. The duo never got this far and is been chase. Tom stab the probe into his thigh and a link vision of Omega hiding in Lourve France. The car get stopped by a soldier and they both knock out. Tom wake up in hospital and lost his power because they did blood transfusion to him. Emily save him and are on their own now to kill Omega. They don't have anymore chances left. Tom decide to find his J squad team and knowing everyone details and all, they are convince of his ability and join him. They pilot the plane and land badly under heavy attack of aliens. The J squad all sacrifice their lives. Emily drive the plane through and crash into the iconic glass tower. Tom and Emily split up to distract the Alpha. She kiss Tom and say if only she can have the chance to know him more. Emily is killed. Tom dive in and saw Omega. Alpha pierce the tentacle through him. But he already pull out the grenades pin and Omega absorb the grenades and exploded. Tom died but his blood fuse with Omega and he is reliving much more further back before going to Brendan office. He correct everything and go back the same base as officer and find Emily.",

Doug Liman, one of the best action/adventure directors out there in my opinion, made it work and delivers a non-stop, heart pounding spectacle of a movie. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt have great chemistry together and the movie almost becomes too smart for the audience, which days and days later is still talked about. Whatever you think of the ending, one thing is for sure everyone has their own interpretation and all of the opinions seem feasible as to what actually happened.

Edge of Tomorrow is a Groundhog Day-esque sci-fi spectacle starring both him and Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada) as soldiers who are facing off against a nearly unbeatable alien race that has implanted itself in European soil (literally) destroying most of the continent as it always knows mankind's every move.  A cowardly, unlike-able Cruise finds himself dropped anew on the beaches of a modern day D-Day where he is killed only to immediately awaken a day earlier ... which happens over and over again.  Blunt plays the lone person who believes his story.  Together they must figure out how to destroy the destructive menace to humanity.  Brendan Gleeson (Braveheart), Bill Paxton (Twister) and Jonas Armstrong (BBC's 'Robin Hood') all co-star.  The film is surprisingly fun and intelligent.  It also was nice seeing Tom Cruise eat some humble pie a time or too.  This is fun sci-fi that might have been a tad bit too long; but I still enjoyed it.",

Tom Cruise's character gets forced into battle, and when one alien's blood covers him, he repeats the day every time he dies.\n\nThe biggest comparison this movie gets is that it's a sci-fi version of Groundhog Day. However, it's actually closer to a lesser-known movie called 12:01, another movie where a guy repeats the day. I say this because, while Bill Murray's character repeats the day because of a magical and unexplainable reason, 12:01 and Edge of Tomorrow give scientific reasons that are in line with the context of their respective films. And without going into detail, they explain why this is happening pretty well.\n\nFor a movie about repeating the day, this movie hardly feels repetitive. They do a good job of skipping over what we've already seen in favor of the new things he tries, and there's even some times where we don't even see his first time trying something. This really helps in keeping this movie fresh and not tired throughout.\n\nThe other major character in this movie is Emily Blunt's character. She's a war hero from a previous battle, and we learn that she knows what Tom Cruise is going through because she also used to be able to repeat the day, so she helps him train and get better at battle. Like Cruise, she's awesome in this movie. She pretty much officially throws off her \"I'm best known for looking like Katy Perry\" label.\n\nI said before that this movie was a pleasant surprise, and yeah, this movie is pretty awesome. Good story, good characters, action is good without overshadowing the plot, it manages to be pretty funny and the right times, and overall it's just a smart movie. I'm ok with this just being a standalone movie, but I think this movie really has the potential to be the next big thing in the science fiction genre.",

This will definitely go in my home collection. Didn't watch it in 3D because movies after James Cameron's Avatar have not lived up to the medium and didn't want to have it sway my opinion of the movie itself. The only negative critique I have is the loop in replay of scenes could have ended a little sooner by a modest one or two scenes but credit the director the change of pace and style came as the feelings for something different started to set in. That being the only critique I had, I still found it 5 star worthy in my opinion.",

Interesting concept and intriguing developments occur. \n\nI won't spoil much of the movie, but since the trailer showed you, I guess I can a little about it. Somehow (explained in the movie), Tom Cruise (movie name William Cage) repeats the same day over and over. I liked the concept of the movie, and I liked how it went. \n\nThen came....the ending. That god damn ending. That ending sucked. The ending was stupid, ridiculous, pompous, and so on. The ending alone kills the thrill of the movie. That dropped my score drastically. \n\nAll in all, good movie with a great concept, but the ending just makes you drop your jaw in ludicrous disbelief. \n\nAnd that's why I give it a 7 out of 10.",

Emily blunt and tom cruise are terrific especially tom cruise. This is his best film in almost a decade. Right up there with Oblivion and missions impossible 4. Great action.

I'm not a big fan of this type of movie or particularly of Tom Cruise but I kept hearing that this was actually quite good and was being overlooked by summer movie viewers for movies of the comic book variety.  The movie takes place, of course, in a miserable futuristic world where the human race is at war with an alien species.  Tom Cruise plays a Major in the military with no practical battle experience and is ordered into active duty for reasons that I wasn't really clear on..maybe because there was this super important big battle akin to Normandy that the humans were launching the next day.  Anyway...after some battle stuff and things go on, Cruise's character finds himself repeating the same day.  Sort of Groundhog Day-ish, but involving war and aliens and it isn't really about Cruise's character finding the good inside him to stop repeating the day.  It has some humor and the acting is convincing for the most part.  Charlotte Riley stands out because her acting and what I think was supposed to be a Southern accent were not convincing.  Tom Cruise is good, but from what I have seen of his performances, he is a good actor and really goes all in with his performances.  I haven't seen Emily Blunt in anything that I can think of so she was convincing as Rita Vrataski since I don't know her as anyone else.  I would have liked Rita to be a little more hardcore badass, but she was still a strong character.  Bill Paxton was so convincing I actually didn't realize he was in this movie until I saw the credits.  The special effects are fine but, as in Godzilla, much of the biggest scene goes on at night so it's in the dark - I don't know why the filmmakers have been going in that direction, it makes it hard to tell what is going on.  There is some use of what I call 'shaky-cam' at moments I don't understand why the director felt it would be beneficial to the film.  Overall, it was a mildly entertaining summer flick.",

Not quite a show stealer from Cruise, but certainly on a level playing field with her badassery and toughness.  She has a real no nonsense attitude, but still offers a soft side.  Bill Paxton was given a few solid scenes to make light of the situation as the oddly comical sergeant and most of the other crew were mainly rag-tag personalities.  As for Cruise, I think he perfectly played the part of unwilling scaredy cat turned ruthless war machine.  We don't ever really get an idea of how many times he keeps resetting the same day (a-la Groundhog Day style) but you get the feeling it ends up being a ton.  \nI thought the aliens were inventive and different.  The end result becomes somewhat of a slight disappointment due to the fact the day keeps resetting so the end should come as no surprise.

        {
            "content": "It's a known fact that Tom Cruise is an action movie star; anything he touches turns to gold and his niche is action movies. Once again, he proves this by providing a thrilling and exciting ride that you may want to take over and over again.  However, while it's a great action movie, it ends up coming up a bit short in some departments, especially the cop-out, hollywood ending (in my opinion) which makes it  a high-concept movie which is less than the sum of its parts.\n\tSo in a nutshell, the earth has been at war between humans and aliens, which is not exactly the most original plot line. What is original is Cruise's character, Cage. He's a media representative. That's initially what got me; Cruise is usually introduced as the action movie's hero who saves the day, and granted he does this, it's the journey and transformation of Cage that really sunk its hooks into me. He's never seen a day of combat but on his first day, manages to kill one of the aliens, called 'mimics' as they can predict our every move as humans, but in the process dies. It's a bit daunting to see Cruise die so early in the movie and it really shakes things up. When he dies, he manages to inherit a power from the alien in which he can reset the day every time he dies.\n\tNow the resetting of the day plot device could have gotten annoying or repetitive, but the director manages to carry it out expertly. I don't want to spoil too much about the movie's plot but let's just say that the plot, though predictable, was still entertaining. He meets up with Rita (Emily Blunt. Lord.) and together they plan to save the world. Like I said, the plot has been done before, but it's how its carried out. Cage basically through trial and error tries to see how far he can make it via memorizing the various positions of the enemies and obstacles. This is one of the first few things that made me think of the movie as a video game adaptation, which only got more interesting as the movie progressed but i'll get to that later.\n\tThe thing about it is, while the plot device is good, it removes a lot of tension from the first 3/4 of the movie as you just figure he's going to come back so he can rectify his mistakes and go even further. This, rather than provide tension, provided hilarity as there were a lot of funny ways that Cruise dies in the movie, and a lot of times Rita kills him just so they can reset. But throughout, the movie never becomes boring. It's an action spectacle; with the 3D really helping to pull the audience into the experience. The action scenes are tense and very well choreographed. To be honest, when I saw the first poster of Cruise in the \"Exosuit\", I almost laughed out loud. But he really pulled it off, Blunt too of course. They must have been at the gym for weeks to have worked with that thing on them for the majority of the movie.\n\tWhat was also amazing was Cage's character development; although he was a bit 2D because he had no real story or motivation, which was disappointing as Cruise has been known to play a man with loss very well, his evolution from scared, trepid media person to action hero by the 3/4 mark is very satisfying. Cruise nails everything once again, with emotions ranging from hopelessness to strength and weakness. He's just got this charm that sways the audience in whatever he's doing. Something of note that is that this is very unlike Cruise's normal character and it's almost as if he was poking fun at the audience's usual expectation of him when he says almost anything to get out of the combat situation. It's a nice reversal and  its come to help me appreciate more of Cruise's versatility as an actor.\n\tIt wasn't all rainbows and sunshine though, as in a remarkable turn of events, Cage manages to get tired and upset that absolutely nothing he does can change the future after a while. It's an interesting emotion to insert into the character and added a dose of realism despite it's sci-fi background. Again, remnant of a video-gamer when you can't beat a boss or a dungeon no matter how hard you try and you reset from a save point and continuously try to change your fate. I don't know if the movie intended to do this, but even if it didn't, this was a very well placed and appreciated idea.\n\tBlunt's character however, suffers in terms of development, as this is mainly Cruise's movie. There's no real depth to her and thus, each time she dies, you feel no real remorse. I will give them this though; it was obvious that some sort of romance had to be sparked between the two good looking leads of the film, but they managed to put it on the back burner with only a few googly eyed looks here and there, and that was appreciated. I really would have hated to see them fall in love and all that with the fate of the planet at stake. Despite no development for her character, by the end of the movie you do feel for her though, even if a little bit, but that's because of Cruise's and Blunt's great chemistry.  Other characters; meh. They were all forgettable as they had no room  for them in the plot, except the occasional 'proving that i've relived this day' segment or in terms of humour, which is sad because the sacrifice would have been okay if they had developed Blunt's character because I really did want to like her, at least more than what they presented.\n\tFlaws are a few; plot for example; they never really explained how the aliens got the power, which in a way, I can't blame the movie for as I can't sit and think of a good explanation for an audience where they can understand and believe a realistic reason for how you can reset a day. I feel as if they did not give the Mimics enough backstory and just made them into a one dimensional villain; something for Cruise to aim to destroy. This is disappointing as it would have been interesting to find out more about their motives and why they wanted to take over earth in the first place. The plot device is also a bit flawed as I know that they were trying to show various different places at which were happening at the same time, but the time felt a bit lagged in that he was alive for longer than a day in some resets, and as such, had the chance to do more. Some of the physics was also not right and a bit unrealistic, especially at a crash scene near the end but I don't want to spoil. Let's just say that it was 'main character syndrome' that saved Cruise as no one else could have survived that.\t\n\tAll in all, Edge of Tomorrow does what it sets out to do; provide an entertaining action movie with tension (well for the final quarter) and impressive sequences. As an overall movie, I feel disappointed, but as an action movie, it's really great, showcasing yet another example of why Cruise is just so good at what he does. People may hate on him, but at the end of the day, you can't say that he isn't good at it. Interesting story and plot device, albeit with some loop holes, but enjoyable nonetheless. 8/10",

I thought this film would be a decent foray into adapting Japanese literature, but it is something else entirely. It feels like a classic action film that has been around a few years but has only recently got the attention and affection it deserved. That is something that a lot of blockbuster filmmakers crave for: a film that cares about the story it's telling and making a memorable experience out of it.\n\nTom Cruise is not the typical 50+ year old you've seen in the movies before. He plays a character who feels and acts younger than any of the recent stuff he's been in. He is an inexperienced fighter terrified about the horrors of this war, where aliens are threatening to destroy the human race, and Cruise is forced to join the fight and kill the extraterrestrials on the shores of France. There he dies, but comes back to life to the moment before he joined the fight, and keeps living and dying in an endless cycle learning step by step and improving step by step so he can get out of the apocalyptic situation he is in.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow is an original film that is like the kind of film you are hungry to watch again and again, just like playing a video game where you keep dying but keep playing, learning from yore mistakes and loving the game.\n\nIs there anything bad about Edge of Tomorrow? Not really. It's all good, except the ending which I will not spoil, but it isn't all that bad in itself.",

Going through the day the first time once with Cage (Tom Cruise) is interesting because you know you are going to experience many different facets and viewpoints of this day throughout the movie and upon doing so, it was very entertaining and amusing to me. I didn't know what to expect from the antagonists, and although nothing too creative or new is present here with the aliens. You don\u00e2??t get a view of them for a while, and you don\u00e2??t get many views, but it\u00e2??s also not a horribly cheesy addition to the film. The creative time/alien part of the film has some flaws, but if you don\u00e2??t over think it and can suspend reality for a bit, you should not be disappointed.\n\nfor full review and other reviews go to moviescoundrel.com",

Edge Of Tomorrow is a predicable film loaded with plot holes in its \"time traveling\" storyline.  Everything is very clean looking and the characters are your typical team of roughnecks from an action movie.  The first hour becomes very boring because it's repeating the same scene over and over again.  Most of this movie was ruined by the coming attraction.  There are really no surprises that boost this above the average action film, but I'm sure it will make a ton of money due to excessive advertising and everyone's false hope in Tom Cruise after the amazing Minority Report.",

It's either a premonition of transhumanist conquering of death or else another in a long series of fantasies we tell ourselves about immortality to sleep at night. Either way, video games have conquered death. So have movies.\n\n\"Edge of Tomorrow\" takes this conquering of death and uses it as its premise. Borrowing the conceit of \"Groundhog Day\" and planting it in a sci-fi thriller, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" uses many of that film's tricks, but, for all the similarities, it feels fresh rather than derivative--in a new context, with new characters and objectives, it's less the profound comic parable (though still very, very funny) and more a straight ahead adventure story, and in that regard it works like gangbusters. There isn't much profundity here--there are a couple of mostly superficial allusions to Christianity, and there's a nice weight given to the idea of only having one shot at something in a world (both theirs and ours) used to second chances, third chances, fourth chances, fifth chances, used to the reset button. Still, what sets \"Edge of Tomorrow\" apart is the precision, the concision and the cleverness of its script, one of Hollywood's best, most compact and entertaining yarns in years, Tom Cruise's phenomenal performance, in which he proves again he's one of the greats, giving a performance that's impressively complex and seemingly effortless, juggling his duties as a hero and an asshole, a comic coward and a romantic lead, all with charm, grace, and perfect, perceptive, intelligent, often bold choices in every moment. Cruise isn't a cookie cutter action hero, and this isn't a cookie cutter summer blockbuster. \"Edge of Tomorrow\" succeeds because of the sheer talent and craft invested, but also because of personality--this sort of movie is surprisingly rare these days, a movie with a sense of personality, a movie with action and humor that's inherently appealing to just about every demographic, rather than the Frankenstein's monsters of watered down, science lab four quadrant assemblies to which we've been privy over the last decade. There's something here for everyone, but, in this case, the appeal arises organically out of the commitment to the material.\n\nThis movie is a blast.",

She and Cage become a fighting team and together they engage in the same battle again, and again until they discover their extraterrestrial enemy's secrets. Astute direction by Doug Liman, with terrific supporting performances by Brendan Gleeson, Bill Paxton, Jonas Armstrong, Tony Way, and Kick Gurry.

While it's been a banner year for great action movies such as Captain America and Days of Future Past, this has to be the surprise hit of the summer to date. From start to finish, not only does this live up to the trailers, it surpasses them. I really liked this well paced, engaging sci-fi film. \n\nIt's one of those movies where you feel you've seen it before, but just not quite in this way and that's what makes feel fresh and new. Part The Matrix Revolutions, District 9 and a few time travel movies I can't quite put my finger on, yet the sum of the parts feels like something completely unique and wholly entertaining. I think the last time I felt a movie was such a great mishmash of different movies was Inception.\n\nThis is also vintage Tom Cruise. He commands the screen with his wit, charm and emotion; for me this is his best movie since Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. If you thought Cruise couldn't carry a blockbuster anymore, Exhibit A. Admittedly, what makes this movie work well however is Emily Blunt; she is excellent! Together they had surprisingly great chemistry and are the backbone of the movie. They provided a few genuine, moving moments (always appreciated in an action movie) that elevate the film. \n\nThere's plenty of action, the special effects are solid and there's more than enough humour to balance it all out. Essentially, this movie has all the elements of a great summer blockbuster and is right up there with Days of Future Past as the best of the year to date. Don't miss this!",

It is inevitable that any time-traveling storyline has plot holes, so don't waste your time figuring out the little details and just under the main back-bone of the plot. \n\nTom Cruise aka \"Officer Bill Cage\" gains the power to continuously re- live the final day of a worldwide invasion against an alien organism. He must attempt to change the course of the war alongside Emily Blunt aka Rita Vrataski, who previously held the power of resetting the day.\n\nStory lines this complex are always destined for failure without solid acting...just look at The Matrix. Cruise's drama, humor, and character development keeps the viewer on the edge alongside an excellent dynamic with Emily Blunt. On a side note I appreciated that Blunt used her real accent in this film, brings out the seduction in her character...unlike her horrendous American accent from \"Looper\". \n\nTo all sci-fans, please be sure watch this movie before it leaves theaters to see Tom Cruise at his absolute best.",

            "content": "It is really unfortunate that this film isn't doing well at the box office.  It's by no means a complete flop, but it really deserved more. (Almost undoubtedly more than the next Transformer film will probably make this weekend.)  Tom Cruise is forced into active duty after trying to blackmail a general, Brendan Gleeson, and in his first battle gets some sort of alien goo spattered all over him before he dies.  This goo gives him the ability to live the previous 24 hours over and over again.  One of the interesting developments of this concept is how Cruise develops from sniveling coward to a human video game; he's done this so many times he now knows where the enemy is going to be before they do.  He gives a great performance.  Always believable and you totally get his emotional state in every scene.  From fear to total bewilderment, to the frustration of no one believing his condition; to his relief at finding a kindred spirit.  His goals also morph from: survive this beach invasion to find the source of the alien's strength and end the war.  His ability to go back in time was previously shared by another soldier, Blunt, and she quickly becomes his partner in training the day before the battle and into the D-Day inspired invasion itself.  \nThere are a lot of great gags wrought from the \"Groundhog Day\" scenario, some of the best include Cruise trying to roll under a supply truck and a scrap with one of his fellow soldiers.  You will see Tom Cruise die many times in this film, for many people that will be worth the price of admission alone.  \nOf course, this film is not the most original but everything is bent in such an interesting manner that it takes you along without feeling derivative. One aspect I wish was developed more was how Cruise's relationship arch with Blunt's character is a one way street.  He has been with her every day for at least months; every day is the first day she has ever seen him.  This does have emotional resonance in later scenes, but I feel more maybe could have been done here.  \nOnce Cruise loses his ability the film becomes more of a conventional action fest.  He falls twice from great distances and just slightly limps away.  I felt this was kind of a cheat because earlier in the film these things would have been a \"reset.\"  Also, I was really scratching my head at the final twist at the end.  How did he win again if he was recontaminated reset to two days earlier????  Wouldn't the explosion killing the hive mind not have happened??? Score: 8",

            "content": "After the second iteration of the Normandy battle sequence, I sighed and asked myself whether I was prepared to sit through two more hours of this. The scene is a visual mess, a frenetic blur of exploding sand and smoke and thrashing CG monsters. The rest of the film does tone it down a bit, but there are far too many action sequences for them all to be so hard to follow. It's fatiguing, and few of them seem to achieve any real poetry - they're just blurry. While the two premises are nice enough - perfectly evolved planet conquering space virus and iterative time travel loops - neither of them are executed with any real interest. The aliens themselves, and the \"jacket\" technology used to fight them didn't do much for me. Cruise is a bland protagonist, which is at least part of why the incessant attempts at humor are so entirely wooden and flat, though the writers deserve most of the blame for that.\n\nSteins;gate and The Man Who Folded Himself developed some really evocative time travel romances, and I think Edge's premise created an opportunity for a fresh version of that premise, in which one partner experiences a year while for the other, every time is the first time. Unfortunately, Emily Blunt, who is a far more interesting character and actor than Cruise, is little more than a tool to forge Cruise into a hero and a reward for achieving it. There were many points when the writers could have foregrounded her, played the whole thing like she was manipulating him to achieve her goal, letting her take the final strike, etc, but she is consistently sidelined. The lack of chemistry between the two, and the paucity of well-written scenes developing their relationship undermines the writers' attempts to play her deaths for pathos. Even the last opportunity to salvage some emotional impact is squandered when the writers employ an unexplained plot device to create a happily ever after ending the story never actually reached.\n\nIt wasn't an offensive movie to watch. It is interesting enough in the moment to provide some entertainment value and keep your mind off of its flaws, but I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time on it when there are so many good movies out there. Watching it feels, more than anything, like playing a videogame, for reasons that are immediately obvious to anyone who has played a video game and knows the premise of the movie. Cruise memorizes map layouts and enemy placements and timings, learns the use of his weapon by repeating the same scenario over and over, there is tepid humor and romance and boring side characters, and obsession with the military, and the plot ends with the protagonists saving the world. It's a bit much.",

However, I was very pleasantly surprised about how fun, smart, and inspired Edge of Tomorrow was. It's definitely not the best sci fi action movie I've seen, but there's so much that's good here that it's definitely worth your time. \n\nDirector Doug Liman has effectively channeled the video game experience as you watch Tom Cruise's protagonist relive the same battle over and over again, each time learning new ways to defeat his enemy. It's the closest Hollywood has come to making a really good video game movie, except this film isn't based on a video game. Rather it's based on a Japanese novel titled \"All You Need is Kill\" (a much more fascinating title), and I can also see the anime influences on this film as well.\n\nMainly in the character of Rita portrayed by Emily Blunt. Blunt gives a wonderful performance as a strong female character in an action film. She was my favorite character in the film, and I loved watching her train the ill-equipped Cruise character.\n\nTom Cruise also does something wonderful in this film, he's kind of the opposite of a Tom Cruise character. He's not cool and suave like Maverick or a well-trained warrior like Ethan Hunt or charming like any character he's played in... well anything. William Cage, Cruise's character, is a coward and a wimp, but through Blunt's help he learns how to fight. It was a great turn by Cruise, and I would like to see him riffing on his own personality. \n\nEdge of Tomorrow does remind audiences how remarkable a presence Cruise is on screen. He's one of the best actors I've seen at taking these big sci fi blockbusters and giving them a human element, simply from his presence on screen. His boyish smile still works and he has a way of delivering lines of dialogue to make them sound more believable and likable. The film benefits greatly from his involvement in it.\n\nThere are some definite issues in this film. The supporting cast outside of Blunt and Cruise are rather cartoonish and comical. I understand the idea that they exist primarily to be an anchor for the audience throughout the time travel, so the bigger and wackier they are the more recognizable they are. However, they were just too much for me. Especially in the final act of the film when they are meant to play a more emotionally grounded role.\n\nThe final act of the film is also a problem, because it's just too conventional. For a film that relies so heavily on the fact that it isn't your conventional action thriller, it falls into your typical Hollywood ending and that was disappointing. I wanted to see more from this movie, not just what I expected to happen.\n\nIn the end, those problems aren't big enough to sink Edge of Tomorrow, and I had a great time in the theater. The one triumph the film has is the fact that it makes me want to see the next Tom Cruise sci fi thriller.\n\nP.S. Watch it in 3D, it's actually worth it.",

This film has the strongest heroine since Alien's Ripley - she is strong, capable, independent, likable and wonderfully realized.

The allies are about to commence their major D-Day battle on the coast of France.  Non-combat soldier Cruise becomes the critical element to the success of that mission.  As you all know by now, somehow he's reliving that battle, everyday.  I'll leave that for you to see.

Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are simply terrific in this action packed Sci-fi thriller.  I'm generally attracted to time travelly sorts of things, and this has that element in spades as the title indicates.  The trailer basically gives you the plot - but these actors really sell it.  I ended up loving nearly every character from the Master Sargent down to the female solider with a hole in her sock.  Since you see the characters multiple times you end up learning about them in a non-linear way which is fun.    So while there is heart in this, I judge action movies on what they did to my pulse - and this quickened it more than a double shot mocha.   I also can't help but think the suits are part of the war future...maybe not the sword, but man Emily is great wielding that bad boy around.   Go see it, and feel free to take the kids older than 10.  Its tense, violent, but clean and a lot of fun.",

Seriously.  WATCH THIS MOVIE.  While many may feel inclined to avoid this one due to its Groundhog Day like premise and Tom Cruise aka \"The Space Pope,\" all the elements work together magnificently.  Cruise can act when he wants to and once in a while he will make a good movie.  This is one of those movies.  The light sci-fi setting, the dark humor, the great insidious alien design, the really cool exo suits, the restrained performance from Cruise and supporting characters make this far more memorable then you would expect.  Emily Blunt is amazing here - her hard-as-nails character (nicknamed \"The Full Metal Bitch\") is a great contrast to the initially unlikable, unprepared protagonist and she enjoys killing him as much she does the \"mimics.\"  Through their forced partnership he toughens up and essentially becomes Commander Shepard/Master Chief.  Once again we have the perfect woman.  I am so messed up.  There's also a distinct Operation Overlord vibe going on here.  An attempt to liberate occupied France from across the English Channel via a beachhead while Russian armies push toward Germany from the east?  Nope.  No World War II connection there.  (It works.)  Many have complained about the ending finding it too neat and tidy.  I didn't mind.  This movie deserves more attention than its getting so it's worth your time.

            "content": "MY REVIEW OF EDGE OF TOMORROW (3  1/2 Stars)\n\nHere's a fun summer surprise - a big budget, effects-heavy videogame of a movie that doesn't suck.  Oh the many ways this could have gone wrong, but doesn't.  \n\nFeaturing a smart, funny script by Christopher McQuarrie (THE USUAL SUSPECTS) and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (FAIR GAME) and directed by Doug Liman (SWINGERS, MR. AND MRS. SMITH, THE BOURNE IDENTITY), EDGE OF TOMORROW far surpassed my expectations.  It feels like a hybrid of ALIENS, GROUNDHOG DAY and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, with a little bit of STARSHIP TROOPERS thrown in there for good measure.  \n\nTom Cruise plays Major Cage, who arrives in London to negotiate his participation in a war against aliens, called Mimics, that have taken over most of Europe.  Unfortunately, he's never seen combat but is forced to join a ragtag squad led by Bill Paxton.  Landing on a beach reminiscent of Normandy in WWII,  he encounters a legendary soldier, Rita (Emily Blunt) but  due to his inexperience, Cruise quickly dies.  This being science fiction, however, he mysteriously wakes up back on the base at Heathrow.  Forced to relive that day over and over, Cruise acquires skills beyond his initial capabilities and joins forces with Blunt to try to annihilate the alien race.  \n\nThe filmmakers do a wonderful job with the rhythms of the repetition.  It could have gotten old, but the transitions are smart and swift.  Cruise is a joy to watch as a fearful man in way over his head.  I'd have to go back to WAR OF THE WORLDS to cite of film of his where I rooted for him as much as I did here.   Structured much like a videogame where you learn a little more each time you're killed and come back stronger, EDGE OF TOMORROW is a fun, noisy hero's journey.  \n\nIt's fun to see Emily Blunt command the screen as strongly as she does.  Usually more comfortable in comedic roles, her lithe, world-weary character has shades of Ripley from the ALIEN franchise. It's a solid fit.  Besides, her yoga pose, repeated often, is worth the price of admission alone. Because Paxton was in ALIENS, there's no mistaking the references all over his scenes with his troop.  All that's missing is a character named Vasquez.  He works well within the structure of the film, barking out prescient statements at Cruise, meant to make you question the reality of any given situation.  \n\nThe Mimics are a fun, original creation with their porcupine-like features and scary scuttling about.  Although I'm not a huge fan of 3-D, the process is most effective whenever one of these aliens pops out at the screen.  Eventually, things become noisy, brash and bloated in the third act (don't they always?) and EDGE OF TOMORROW slightly wears out its welcome, but it's not enough to mar the overall feeling that you've had a time-trippy good time.",

I was in a state of stunned disbelief. I came to watch yet another rubbish Tom Cruise Sci-Fi action-fest and what I ended up seeing was - nervous cough - a genuinely decent film. It had a great pace. It was sharp. It was funny. It was clever in as much as a Tom Cruise sci-fi actioner can be considered clever. The performances were good, especially the English-rose-turned-blade-wielding bad-ass, Emily Blunt, who is utterly compelling as the so-called \"full metal bitch.\" \nNaturally, once the film had finished, I staggered outside, glancing around for signs of famine or pestilence or even nuclear war... Nothing. It was true after all. I had in fact watched a good film and the apocalypse had not arrived.\nOn a crucial side note, this alien-bashing cousin of 'Groundhog Day' was directed by 'Bourne Identity' director, Doug Limen and co-written by 'Usual Suspects' screenwriter, Christopher Mc Quarrie. So, with that in mind, it's not such a devastating shock that it came crafted with a certain degree of quality and care. Still, I'll be damned... There's life left in the old Cruiser yet! Fingers crossed for a Top Gun sequel!\n\nSimon Prunty\n21/06/2014",

And surprisingly, this scifi actioner is the most human Tom Cruise we've seen in some time, despite the fact that he's been infected by alien blood and travels through time.\nThough it falls back into standard action cliches in the third act, the humour of the first half make for a surprisingly light an enjoyable action film.\nSide note: if there was one moment I'd like to relive over and over it would be Emily Blunt in full yoga mode.

A very good movie with a great story to tell, for this era of filmmaking, it may go down as a masterpiece and maybe an Oscar winner.

It was a very unexpected masterpiece for regular people that don't expect movies to be more entertaining than books. Books will always be better, because they are longer and more drawn out and finicky, including comic books, which are considered better entertainment than movies, which are more straight and to the point - for hard working rednecks and turkeys that don't expect ANY movie to be overdramatic or over-the-top or ultra-cool or super long, it's tough for human beings to go on camera and do stunts and do some hard work and make movies, to show up and go to work in front of a camera every day, they have to leave their art room, where books and art are made, and work in a team full of bitterness and chaos and paranoia and still not make mistakes and put together a great show for undemanding moviegoers to sit and watch and not do any work.

The device of the time loop can be annoying but here it's handled with creative edits and used to advance the story line quickly.  We feel Cruise's confusion, understanding then determination.  Visually, the aliens annoyed me - they were more mechanical than organic but their blood is key to the story?  I didn't get it...  Emily Blunt is, as always, awesome.  However, for a character billed as the Full Metal Bitch, she seemed a bit fragile and dependent at times.  The action was good (no impossible fist fights on moving vehicles!

AWESOME MOVIE!!!\n\nYou know when you see a trailer and it doesn't do a good job of selling a movie? That is what happened here in a BIG way, and someone is going to lose their job or will now be apart of the clean up crew at that marketing firm. \n\nThe trailers for Edge of Tomorrow told me that this was going to be a generic science fiction flick, with good stars, who appear to be in a serious ground hogs day action type movie. The worst part is, it apparently did that to a lot of you. The biggest problem (for the marketing team) is that the movie is F#&KTASTIC!!! \n\nCage, (Cruise) a high ranking officer who only does PR work, gets thrown into battle and is having this terrible ground hogs day thing going on. That's when the director (Doug Liman) and edit room do an excellent job mixing in the action and humor to take you on this 2 hour sci-fi ride. \n\nThe movie actually gets quite comical, and not the accidental comedy you find in some sci-fi duds. The movie provides you with some real hard laughs, while taking you on Cages journey to make this day go as flawless as possible to succeed on his new mission. Cruise comes into contact with the slightly above average looking Rita (Blunt) on one of his early missions. This sword wielding Rita is definitely The Full Metal Bitch. She is a powerhouse in the war against the aliens and is treated like a Queen by her brethren. This chick is an ultimate badass, and you ask how did she get to be so awesome. Check this movie out, and you will find out why you should start doing yoga!!! lol\n\nThe laughter in the movie was great to break up the tension, but this movie also does a great job with intermingling the action and plot. So the excitement is pretty constant, and you don't get any long lulls of dialogue that drag on (like my review) in the 1 hour 53 minute movie. \n\nI was not looking forward to seeing this film, and found myself all fired up and extremely pleased with it at the end. Edge of Tomorrow was just an extremely well done sci-fi, action, comedy. Great job to everyone involved with the film!!\n\nThis movie is just a basket full of summer blockbuster fun and entertainment. If you like action, comedy or science fiction this is a MUST see this summer!\n\nCineBro1 rates Edge of Tomorrow: 4 out of 5\nCineBro2 rates Edge of Tomorrow: 3 out of 5\n\nThe CineBros rate Edge of Tomorrow: 7 out of 10",

I love Sci-Fi, but for some reason, I just could not cross the 'Tom Cruise is a nutball' factor. \n\n\n\nDon't even sweat it.  He gets his cockiness knocked out of him in the first 10 minutes, by MAD EYE MOODY!!!  He is scared, confused, and human.  The film is well written, unpredictable, and very funny.  The cast is fantastic, particularly Emily Blunt as one of the best bad asses in a film since MAD EYE MOODY!!!

            "content": "\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is one of the most surprising movies of the year, turning out to be a supremely fun sci-fi/action/comedy that easily could knock a film off the list of Tom Cruise's top 10 best vehicles (and there are many).  Why do I say the film's success is surprising? I can easily remember sitting in the movie theater, only a month ago, when the trailer flashed across the screen.  As soon as I saw Tom Cruise's face, all I could think was, why does he keep resorting to such dumb action movies for roles?  Based off of his last two movies, \"Oblivion\" and \"Jack Reacher\", which have been mildly entertaining but nowhere near the caliber of his past endeavors, it seemed as though \"Edge of Tomorrow\" would be the final nail in his career coffin.  It wasn't until the hugely positive reviews came out that I actually became fascinated.  Could the film actually be good?\n\tSurfing on yahoo.com the other day, I noticed an article that called out Cruise's latest choices in projects, begging him to return to pure acting flicks like \"Magnolia\" and \"Jerry Maguire\" - apparently, the author had not seen \"Edge of Tomorrow\" quite yet.  Yes, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is a thriller, but it most certainly is not a dumb one.  With the new \"Transformers\" coming out, along with the sure-to-bomb \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (both helmed by Michael Bay, who needs to be stopped immediately), it's refreshing to have a popcorn feast that doesn't throw us under the bus.  And considering the only intelligent takes lately have been Marvel superhero films, you can say that \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is a breath of fresh air.\n\tTaking place in the near future, where thoroughly evolved aliens are much too close to overthrowing Earth, we find that Cruise has transformed himself into Major William Case, an officer who prefers to give orders rather than go into combat.  His horn is untooted, though, when he inexplicably is pushed into battle by a higher ranking official.  As it turns out, what he is being thrown into is, in actuality, a suicide mission.  Cage dies quickly, but before he meets his demise, the blood of one of the aliens he attempts to kill splatters all over this body.  Why is this detail important? A) The alien he killed is the rarest of his kind and has the ability to reset an entire day and b) this alien is the key to winning the war.\n\tCage suddenly is able to relive the same day over and over again, enduring combat and dying repeatedly in the same way Bill Murray showed us back in 1993.  Cage gets lucky, however, when he runs into Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), the Rosie the Riveter of her time - she herself has had the same experience as Cage, and she is able to serve as his counterpart as they travel through space and time to get closer to defeating the enemy.\n\t\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is able to be frothy, loads of fun, and durably suspenseful, often all at the same time.  Blunt has said in multiple TV interviews that there were several times where she and director Doug Liman would have a sort of spat in terms of how a scene should be shot, only to remember that neither of them are action movie pros.  But you would never know.\n\tCruise performs all of his own stunts, and has done so for years, and throughout his characterization we can feel the fun he is having.  In movies like \"Edge of Tomorrow\" he is in his comfort zone, and it's a joy to watch an actor who is there for adventure rather than just a paycheck.  His rapport with Blunt is easy going and alive with energy.  She is instantly his most memorable female co-star in recent years.  Minus the one itty bitty kiss they share towards the end of the film, she remains the Hutch to his Starsky, the Crockett to his Tubbs.  Blunt is given the opportunity to be a wise-cracking, tough-as-nails partner a la Black Widow of \"The Avengers\", and she nails it with a passion.\n\tMaybe it hasn't made a ton of money in these past few weeks, but for Tom Cruise naysayers, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is worth the price of the ticket.  Forget the three hankies you have to bring with you to see \"The Fault in Our Stars\" - bring along a large popcorn instead for this movie.",

            "content": "'Edge Of Tomorrow' is a sci-fi thriller. In short, it is military science fiction combined with time travel (read time loop) and alien attack! It is based on the book 'All You Need Is Kill' by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.\n \nMajor William Cage (Tom Cruise), who is kind of a figurehead with no combat experience, is forcibly thrown into a doomed-to-die warfare with an alien race called 'The Mimic'. As expected, soon upon entering the battlefield along with his peers, he faces death. But shockingly, from there itself, he enters into an infinite loop of death and resurrection. \n\nHe realizes that the best way to end this in his favour, is to demolish 'Omega' i.e. the brain of the Mimic. Apart from him, only two other people aware of this death and resurrection phenomenon are - Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a Special Force Warrior and her scientist associate. In true blue Tom Cruise style, Cage along with the two aforesaid military people, uses his each new life to further strategize his mind and train his physique, so as to decrease the distance between him and Omega by at least a few steps, before he meets his new death!\n \nLike a video game in play, with every death, Cage is required to restart his life from the same time stamp (or level). And like a video gamer, with every new life, though he is required to play the same set of scenarios with pre destined (or planned) succession, he is wiser and better equipped to play the game a tad bit further. So, throughout the movie, he is mostly plotting and preparing for the next day battle, with as many variations as possible. Hence, the movie is titled 'Edge Of Tomorrow' and it's tag line reads 'Live.Die.Repeat'.\n \nIn the world of movies, this plot is rather new and tricky to handle. Director, screenwriters, cast and other crew members deserve full marks for pulling this off in as much audience friendly manner as possible. A noteworthy scene is the one wherein, just prior to one of her deaths, Rita divulges her middle name to Cage. This scene has a subtle tenderness which is aptly absent throughout the movie. In most parts, the film looks like a gothic mesh of bulky metal combat gear, metallic octopus-like high powered aliens, advanced weaponry and repeat upon repeat!\n \nApproximately, twenty years back, Tom Cruise successfully carried off the internationally acclaimed sci-fi thriller, Mission Impossible (1996). And even today, he is carrying such a film with great aplomb. The kind of distinct continuity he has maintained in the film, is no mean feat. Emily Blunt looks extremely athletic and agile. It is impossible to compare this avatar of hers from her stint in 'The Devil Wears Prada'. Herein, she is referred as 'Full Metal Bitch'. But the significance of the same is lost in the book-to-film translation. Others have performed good as well. \n\nThis movie successfully entwines you to the psychology of the protagonist. \nAlongside him, you will experience the same time frame and level of confusion, mirth, determination, fear, boredom and frustration. And just because, it already has so many repeat scenes, it is impossible to see it more than once.",

So much so that I completely forgot Cruise was in it. That really did something for me and I'm curious and interested in checking Cruise's previous films. Maybe there has been something special that I've been missing out all this time.\r\n\r\nThe plot takes us on a journey and uses the \"Groundhog Day\" essence of repeating the same day over and over as the intelligent tool of this movie, and not once does it get repetitive.\r\nAfter initially seeing the preview months ago, it didn't strike as a movie to invest my time however the visuals, storyline and comedy timing proves to be a movie I'll definitely be seeing again in the future.",

            "content": "I was skeptical about this movie after watching the trailers. I was excited about another Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion, a couple of years ago. However, it received poor reviews and I never came around to actually watch it. I expected Edge of Tomorrow to be a similar disappointment. However, it received great reviews and praise prior to its release. As such, I cautiously went to see this movie hoping for the best but still keeping my expectations modest. I am happy to say that the Edge of Tomorrow is a brilliant, science-fiction movie and significantly exceeded all my expectations. I left the theater completely satisfied and had no criticisms. It is the best unique concept for a film since Inception. Its idea with time travel, resetting the day, is thought provoking and thoroughly developed during the film. My greatest fear with this concept is that it could get tedious or difficult to follow. However, Director Doug Liman does a flawless job with it. There is no reset that does not add to a great story. In addition, the movie is very smart in utilizing a few funny deaths that provide comic relief. Combined with an alien invasion, the time traveling concept is an unbelievably intriguing story. For a person that loves to study history, I also like that the film features a human invasion of Europe through France to counterattack the aliens. It is a clever acknowledgement of the invasion of the beaches of Normandy during World War II since the movie is released on June 6, 2014, which is exactly 70 years since D-Day. Moreover, Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt provide great performances as the main protagonists, Major William Cage and Sergeant Rita Vrataski. Even after Cruise's recent movie duds, he proves that he can still be a great leading actor in an action film. Blunt is brilliant as the beautiful, bold, and tough \"Full Metal Bitch\". The two also have great chemistry in the film. While the ending is nothing special and relatively simple, I appreciate that it wraps up a complex story and ties out all the loose ends. More impressively, Director Doug Liman delivers an intricate science fiction plot, compelling human story, good action, and humor in a tidy film of less than two hours. While I would still not classify this film as a must see in the movie theaters, I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great movie this summer that does not include comic book characters or giant monsters. It is definitely worth watching for all moviegoers so put it on your list of movies to watch even if you do not go to the movie theaters to see it.\n\nFor my full review, please see http://rookerville.com/2014/06/18/edge-tomorrow/",

            "content": "Edge of Tomorrow or otherwise known as Live Die Repeat is a science fiction action film starring Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill Paxon and Jonas Armstrong. It is based it on the Japanese manga All You Need Is Kill. This film was released last summer so there won't be any big awards and achievement yet for this film until next year. Edge of Tomorrow is more of a underrated film due to its risky performance at the box office. Is Edge of Tomorrow a well-received flick or is there a reason why it did badly at the box office? The story follows Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is force to fight in a battlefield against the alien like creatures known as the Mimics, which they are divided into the Alphas and the Omega. The reason why he is force to fight is because he black mailed the head General (Brendan Gleeson) for sending untrained soldiers into the battlefield. Cage gets killed by the Mimics, but gets stuck into a loop from the Alpha Mimic and wakes up on the day before the big battle. Now Cage has to die a million times in order to be a fully trained solider and defeat the Mimics from ending humanity with the help from a high rank solider Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). The plot fells like a combination of other critically acclaimed films like Groundhog Day or the Alien franchise. It brings an unexpected but fun twist at times during the movie like if Cage actually dies the next time if he wakes up or where the Omega Core is actually located like a Damn in London or France. The plot itself is absolutely enjoyable, funny, and unpredictable at time. If I have to pinpoint one problem with the film is the ending. I don't want to spoiler anything about it, it's a bit of a nitpick. This is one of those Science fiction action movies that show that a great story comes with great visuals. Speaking of the visuals, the visuals are the highlight of the movie, especially with the design and moments of the Mimics. I didn't even expect for the aliens in the movie to move so quick that they were on a sugar rush. The scenes when the characters are on the battlefield is the best part to watch since it shows so much visual effect all happening at the same time. The budget on this film was $178 million and I could see why the budget was so big. The battle suit in the film were design as powered exoskeleton suits, similar to James Cameron films like Aliens and Avatar. It looks cool and awesome to get on, but I could see why Cruise character Cage had trouble working it during the first few loops. There's even a hilarious training scene when Vrataski has to trained Cage on controlling the suit better in combat, even if he dies a couple of times. The direction of the film is mostly set in London and France since that's where the film takes place. The director Doug Liam did a great job on setting the film in those areas since the manga was set in Japan. The music in the film isn't that memorable but the sound effect is. The sound effect is more upbeat and big since this was released in theaters that feature surround sounds so big that it kills the THX sound effect in the beginning of a movie. The editing is well done also with a lot of stunt performance done on set. The characters are different compared to the Japanese manga, but are still fun to watch on screen. William Cage was a formal Major who was sent to fight against the Mimics and acquires the ability to repeat time after he gets killed every time on the battlefield. Cruises role in this film is similar to another role that he was in called Oblivion, but its done way better with some of his smart humor he pulls, similar to Bill Murray's performance in Groundhog Day. Then there's Rita Vrataski, a Sergeant who looks hot and smart most of the time during the film, however her character has a short change compared to Cruises character. Dr. Carter (Noah Taylor) is a former government scientist who is also an expert in Mimic biology. General Brigham is just the typical hate able general, who just want to lead the battle his way even if he gets blame for being responsible for all the untrained soldiers dying in combat. There's also the J squad, who are just there as untrained soldiers at first, but actually help the main character out during the third act of the film. It is lead by Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) who sounds like Tom Hanks at times when he is acting, but still has a few funny moments. If there is one character that I have to pick in the film is the Mimics. Its not there personality that I like about them, it's the way they move around and attack anyone they encounter. They have a dark like color design with little color glowing energy like the orange color is the Omegas and the Alpha is blue. The characters carry fun humor to make the film worth watching. Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is a fun action sci-fi flick with a mind-blowing story, spectacular visuals and enjoyable story. Even though the film is completely different from the manga, it is still a must see film. Also the film is rated PG-13 so viewer desecration is advised. If I have to rate this film, I will give it 4/5 stars or on a scale to 1 to 10, it gets an 8.5/10.",

Unexpectedly Tom Cruise plays a very fun character...chuckles and laughters will come without even realising it. His role is very believable and different from the hero-poster role that one would assume. Believable and great are also all of the other characters: the gorgeous Emily Blunt (strong vulnerable warrior) and the classic Bill Paxton in his USA marine role. Nothing is new in the movie, the plot is almost totally predictable, but the way the story develops and the way the director plays with the repetition of time and the choice of the moments presented in this loop never fail to amaze.

            "content": "Despite mixed reviews, I enjoyed last year's sci-fi Tom Cruise film Oblivion, as it's nice to see people making new and inventive (if not particularly original) science fiction movies nowadays. It seems as if more and more sci-fi films are either remakes (Total Recall, Robocop), reboots (Prometheus, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), or sequels (Transformers 4, X-Men: Days of Future Past). This isn't necessarily an awful thing, as remakes, reboots, and sequels all have their place, and can be good in their own right. But if I had to go a year without some new and inventive science fiction, I'd probably lose my mind. \r\n\r\nThank God for movies like Edge of Tomorrow, a movie that may not be smart on a philosophical level, but is inarguably smartly made. This film gave me hope for both science fiction films and action movies alike, using both old cliches and new ideas to good results. Edge of Tomorrow stars Tom Cruise as William Cage, a poster boy for a war effort against an alien invasion set in the near future. When he is unexpectedly sent to the battlefield, he accidentally gains the alien's power of reversing time when he kills one and is smothered in its blood. Essentially, he now has the video game power of infinite respawn-- Whenever he dies, he comes back to life at his save point. Emily Blunt, who had the power once but lost it, helps guide him on his mission to kill the alien's central control-hive-mind-thingy, and there you have your plot.\r\n\r\nWhat I appreciate most about this film is its willingness to not take itself seriously. Cruise doesn't play his typical character, he instead takes the part of a wimpy, diminutive, whiny little press icon who has never actually seen battle. This is a bit of a stretch for the guy who always seems to get typecast as MAVERICK: The Cocky, Charming Pilot Who Plays By His Own Rules! His performance is one of the strongest ones he's given in years, and he hits every right note when it comes to how a real person would react in his situation. There's also a welcome amount of humor, mostly constructed around Cruise's constant deaths, and the movie doesn't shy away from poking fun at its central premise. In a time when most films are dark, Christopher Nolan-y exposition-fests, I couldn't possibly appreciate this more.\r\n\r\nThe action is equally strong, and is coherently filmed-- No shaky cam or quick-zooms to be found here. The director and cinematographer clearly understood that action isn't just about physical movements, it's about motivation (a concept that was lost on the creators of Transformers: Age of Extinction). There's a montage halfway through the movie that may just be my favorite action centerpiece of the year. What makes most of this film's gimmicks work are the constant, subtle jabs at the genre itself, and of course the legitimately entertaining action. The semi-futuristic world that this movie crafts is extremely imaginative and involving, from the alien designs to the mech suits worn by the grunts of the military. Altogether, it's a very well put-together film.\r\n\r\nTowards the end, the movie starts taking itself a little too seriously, however, and it adapts the darker, explosion-filled style that we all too often expect of modern science fiction films. However, I can't deduct too many points for this, because as the stakes get higher the film clearly needs to have a more emotional climax than the rest of the movie. But did we really need to have a bunch of marines running around in the dark AGAIN? Also, I'm a little miffed at the way the movie uses a plot point that ends up in the vein of Deus ex Machina at the end. It's a little reminiscent of the ending to Source Code, except here it doesn't make any sense (no spoilers!). But since the rest of the movie is so strong, and because I just love movies like this, it didn't detract from my enjoyment much, and I doubt anyone else would say otherwise.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Edge of Tomorrow: 7/10 stars. This is nothing more than a simple, fun summer blockbuster, but it really does wonders with its premise. There's a lot to love in this movie, and even if it isn't particularly highbrow entertainment, a lot of work and effort went into crafting it, and boy did it pay off. It's truly refreshing to see an action film that actually took some creativity to make. Take note, Michael Bay. All the makings of a sci-fi classic are here. The characters are relatable, the story is interesting, and the action is actually quite intelligent, unlike Tin Cans In A Blender 4. Altogether an entertaining and awesome experience that people will hopefully talk about for years to come.",

While it starts off a bit slow with the usual style of mission impossible and a little bit of video game effects, it builds into a cool and thrilling adventure thanks to the great inspiring yet emotional chemistry between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. With addition of some smart dark humors, chilling action scenes, strong scores and stunning visual effects during repetitive death/ life, the film has turned out as a successful and entertaining science fiction for this summer.",

            "content": "I read the book in February and it was crap, so that might've lowered my expectations. Then again, I started seeing all this praise from many reviewers and that got my hopes up, balancing my expectations out. I ended up being indifferent to the final product afterwards, though it's still adequate entertainment and I imagine lots of audience members will accept the film with passion, despite how routine the story feels. To begin with, the movie hints that it will have a strong personality, but it doesn't deliver in the end. Some humour to start off, then this aspect drops off and things become completely flat, the jokes forgotten. I realised my experience was not going to be as good as I initially perceived because during the set-up, none of the characters made an impression on me. Honestly, you don't know anything about them. Does Bill have a family, for example - I have no idea. The same goes for the alien enemies (What's their deal? I don't know). So generally the flaws with the book transferred to the movie. It's a poor screenplay in terms of depth. When you really think about it, everything else tries hard - the screenplay just needed more innovation.\n\nThe 'reliving the same day' device isn't original, though it's slightly smart here. Still, it does get tiresome because there are no real jokes and because no new ideas are added to the mix. This is not a mindfuck movie. I was really surprised that it was devoid of frequent twists, or at least one different take on the time travel idea, possibly taking the formula somewhere new. The video game replay idea is the only theme that sustains the movie. It disappointed me greatly. I expected more. I feel out of touch by saying there's not much cool here either in terms of action, music, good guys, bad guys etc. Not terribly troubling to me though - the hollow tone worked for 'Pacific Rim' and 'Ender's Game'. I prefer 'Oblivion', Tom Cruise's previous sci-fi, even though that lacked originality too. In any case, people will adore this 'Groundhog Day' clone because it's passable entertainment. It doesn't do enough, but I could watch it again on disc one day. It has impressive visuals, and I suppose the premise is intelligent. And I just can't dismiss sci-fi. This movie has some fun within, so it delivers to some degree.",

            "content": "In a summer that's all sequels and remakes, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is not only a breath of fresh air because it's one of the most original science fiction films in a long time, but it's also very funny, smart and exciting. The plot sounds more complicated than it actually is, so bear with me for a second. Earth is under attack. Alien creatures named Mimics have taken over a significant portion of Europe but after years of being pushed back we've finally been able to hold our ground and are mounting a counter attack. Things are looking up but when Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is ordered to head into battle by his superiors, he tries to unsuccessfully blackmail his way out of combat, is knocked out and sent on the front lines, despite his lack of training. The attack is a total disaster and Cage, along with the entire front line is dead within minutes. That's when Cage wakes up. Something happened to Cage when he died that first day, and now he relives that attack over and over. Each time he dies, he wakes up that same morning with the army sergeants delightfully informing the people around him that he's a coward and that they're all headed for the mother of all glorious battles against the Mimic. The thing is, Cage retains his memories and is able to change the events of the battle. Stumbling upon Sergeant Rita Vrataski a.k.a. the \"Full Metal Bitch\" (Emily Blunt) she recognizes what is happening to him and informs Cage that he might be humanity's only hope.\n\nLet me run you by that premise one more time. We have a guy that's got no business on the front line of an alien-human war. He's a coward without any real military experience (it's implied he gained his rank by sitting behind a desk and spearheading the propaganda department), doesn't even know how to operate the high-tech equipment that's given to him and dies within minutes when the attack begins. When he dies, he wakes up again unscathed at the military base where everyone is getting ready for the invasion. He remembers everything that's happened to him so he tries again to go on the beach. He dies again. He wakes up again, only to die one more time. And so on. What's great about this setup is that we have a mix of a comedy and an action movie. As Cage wakes up every day, he quickly gets tired of hearing the drill sergeants yelling the same instructions and motivational speeches all the time. He gets tired of seeing the attack go belly-up and he gets REALLY tired of getting on the beach just to die immediately. There appears to be no limit to the amount of times he can die, so slowly, he begins learning. He starts memorizing where the enemies are going to pop up, what the most efficient way to do everything is, how to avoid people's attention or how to be at the right place at the right time. Every time he lands on that beach he gets a little bit better. Eventually, he is a blur on the battlefield, hitting opponents dead center and being able to instinctively where the next targets are going to be. You see a guy that was a total coward evolves into the ultimate badass on the battlefield... through trial and error. And by trial and error I mean increasing frustration and lethal blows to the head. If you love Tom Cruise, it's going to be awesome because he's charming and gets to become a badass. If you don't like him, you get to see that grin whipped off his face as he gets shot in the head, crushed, blown up, run over and drowned over and over. Eventually he is able to stop people dead in their tracks because he's memorized what they're going to say and everything else there is to know about them. That information helps him get to the bottom of what exactly is going on.\n\nWhat you won't know about this film based on the trailers is how funny it is. So Cage needs to do something different than just go on the battlefield and shoot these aliens. There's just too many and no matter what he does, he ends up dead. His solution is to look for help, get training and find out everything there is to know about anyone that could help him out. He becomes so good at memorizing patterns and information about people that he is able to infiltrate high-security areas based solely on when this guy bends down to tie his shoe laces, when that girl turns around because she hears the phone ring and how long the elevator door stays open. Unfortunately, it's a long, tedious process that requires him dying every time he gets caught so frankly, the guy gets bored and irritated. He tries elaborate ways to speed up the constant briefings he receives and sometimes, they work. Other times, he ends up getting hit by a car and cursing his bad luck when he wakes up. The best way I can describe the process is by comparing to a video game. If you play a really difficult video game, you will die over and over. You never run out of continues so you keep playing and you start getting better not really because your skills improve, but because eventually you just mentally write down where all the enemies are going to be and what each music cue means. It's the same thing for our hero. Death is no longer something to be feared, it's the ultimate inconvenience because it means he has to go back to the last \"save spot\" and listen to that boring cut scene again.\n\nI found the movie to be a really inspired blend of an intelligent, clever comedy and a wicked science fiction action flick. The action sequences are tense when director Doug Liman wants you to be worried  and funny when it's time to break that tension with some laughs. As the story moves along, you get to see our main character evolve and become faced with some pretty daunting choices. The recurring side characters are also a lot of fun. Bill Paxton plays a great drill sergeant that revels in delivering his thoroughly rehearsed speeches about the heat of combat and soldiers purging themselves of anything that would hold them back. You can tell this character loves his job an extra percent on the day the movie is playing out because on top of having some fresh meat to break in, he gets to give this particular new recruit an extra hard time because he's a traitor. There are some big laughs between his character, who does not change one bit and Cage, who gets increasingly irritated when every time he wakes up he gets yelled at. Not to be forgotten is Emily Blunt, playing one of the coolest female heroes we've seen in a long time. She's Sergeant Vrataski, The \"Full Metal Bitch\". It's not enough that she's gunning down the aliens like no one else can, she also wields what looks like a severed helicopter blade as a sword. She and Cage team up against the baddies and it's a dazzling display. They're dodging projectiles and tentacles, doing backflips and crushing the aliens by any means necessary. Their dynamics are really interesting because every time they meet he gets to be a little bit better and learn a little bit more about her, but for Vrataski, it's the first time she's laid eyes on this guy.\n\nThe film really fires on all cylinders. The aliens are unique in their design and movements and when it comes to combat, these creatures are so formidable you really realize how stacked the odds are in their favor. The special effects are terrific and look even really impressive in 3-D. There are more than a few scenes where there are tentacles, shrapnel, explosions, bubbles or other things popping out at you and on the big screen with the sound cranked up really high and an audience that's laughing at the funny stuff, it's really terrific. It's a science fiction film that has the perfect mix of admitting it's a crazy story you can't take too seriously and an epic action movie where everything is on the line. Check out \"Edge of Tomorrow\" and when you do, make sure it's on the biggest screen you can, with a crowd that wants to have a good time and, if you can manage, see it in 3-D too. It's original, funny and thoroughly exciting. (3-D Theatrical version on the big screen, June 13, 2014)",

Cage (Tom Cruise), a lower level military officer, is ordered by his superiors to fight in the battle dubbed Operation Downfall. He is forcibly shipped into battle where he and the rest of the army are defeated and killed, he then has to relive that terrible day over and over and over again. That's right, this film is indeed Groundhogs Day meets Starcraft, and it is endlessly entertaining.\n\n For the first 40 minutes of the film, Tom Cruise plays a huge coward (you know the word I want to use) who dies many gruesome deaths. Yes, it is huge fun getting to see Tom Cruise dying repeatedly, and I loved that at first his character is so not the typical Tom Cruise we get in films. Emily Browning is also the hottest she has ever been as the hardcore, ass-kicking soldier Rita. She is super impressive here, and I actually dug the relationship between Rita and Cage (It's not really love).  \n\nI saw the film in 3-D and I thought it was some of the best 3-D I have seen in a while. Things are constantly jumping into the theater or into your face, but at the same time we get great depth as well. The whole film is shot in such a way that with 3-D you really do feel like you are there. I love that this isn't cheap science fiction either, it's actually pretty strong stuff.\n\nThe director of the film is Doug Liman, who also directed Jumper and The Borne Identity. He actually does a pretty great job here. It also helps that  the script by Christopher McQuarrie, Jezz Butterworth, and Jon-Henry Butterworth is a strong one which has been adapted from a Japanese Manga named All You Need Is Kill (This was the film's original title as well until what I assume was studio interference led them to change it. I honestly still prefer the original title, it sounds more bad-ass). \n\nIn a nutshell: Edge of Tomorrow is what happens when you mix a sci-fi alien invasion film with Groundhogs Day and Call of Duty. I was surprised at how great the result was (especially with Browning and Cruise as the leads).My only real complaint was how they kind of backpedaled on the ending. Edge of Tomorrow truly is an original, innovative, super entertaining , and really funny film that most definitely is worth your time and money. It's the best film I have seen in theaters for a while, and you should definitely see it (in 3-D, if possible).\n\n4.5 STARS",

Refreshing to see Cruise play an unlikable character at first and the military subtext of how humanity is always fighting and the US profits from war is a fine addition (slightly reminiscent to Iron Man). Borrowing from Groundhog Day was a stroke of genius. Having it be sci-fi keeps things fresh enough. I also like the quiet character moments like when he makes her coffee. My only complaint would be I wish there was just a bit more of an emotional impact. Perhaps even a deeper meaning explored in the theme would have been good too.\n\nStill, it's a solid ride with an extremely tight script. (A shame the aliens look a little bit too much the sentinels from The Matrix). I've heard some complaints about the \"happy\" ending. Although, I have a theory about that... SPOILER! I believe the Omega is still alive and it used Cruise to rewind back 24 hours. It then got its alien creatures to retreat from the war (no resistance after all) and relocate the Omega. After all, Cruise would now know that it's in Paris. Remember when Emily Blunt explained that the creatures gave them a false victory in the past? I believe they did it again. But this time the aliens didn't just fool the characters, they also fooled the audience into believing it's a happy ending. When it actually isn't. Sequel!",

But I still walked away from this film feeling as if there was so much untapped potential in the plot execution. Its just that, on the subject of deja vu, all I could think about throughout the entire movie is how similar the general idea is to 2011's Source Code, and perhaps my disappointment set in when we reached the credits and I really had nothing substantial to distinguish the two. But for those who do not demand Christopher Nolan's level of physiological indulgence and can deal with Tom Cruise being what he normally is in an action flick, there is still plenty to enjoy here.",

            "content": "Now, despite my rating of this movie I am going to start off by saying that this movie was decent. I don't think it's great, however, I don't think it is the worst film to ever be released. The overall story of the movie is told well enough to keep my attention. So for that reason alone, it's a movie worth seeing at the movie theaters or renting at your local box office; Although it's not worth the twenty dollars for a copy on DVD. Why is it then I gave this movie such a low rating? Even when I said that this movie is worth watching. Well as I was watching this film there came a scene where Tom Cruise talks to a scientist who explains his invention. The scientist explains that his invention hasn't been fully tested. In response says something along the lines of something something something \"THEORY\". Now why does this word bother me? It's not so much the word as it is the use of the word. Again in the scene a device that is created and hasn't been tested which uses an unknown technology is called a theory. For those of you who do not understand why this would make me cringe, then let me try and explain. In this scenario this device is used as a scientific device which means that it has to go under a little process called the scientific method. This process goes a little something like this. First is the hypothesis, which is just an idea, then the hypothesis is test not just by the original scientist but by other people (a lot of people), once it has been tested over and over again, and has proven to work and is consistent, it then becomes a theory. Which the definition of is \"Comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence.\"  (http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&page=11)\n\nSo to conclude this review, it is a decent movie but don't go in with high expectations. To conclude my rant, please use the word Theory properly, yes the word theory can be used to mean a hunch, however, when used in a scientific context then it means a hypothesis which as been tested to be true.",

            "content": "This summer has been great for action movies, so can a a veteran action star like Tom Cruise compete? I was a week late to finding out the answer in his sci-fi thriller Edge of Tomorrow but that answer is a very definitive \"yes.\" If you're still sitting around waiting to go see this movie, then I have just one thing to tell you: \"On your feet, maggot!\"\n\n\n\nEdge of Tomorrow is a sci-fi war movie directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) and stars Tom Cruise as Bill Cage and Emily Blunt as Rita Vretaski. When Cage is asked to head to the front lines, he blackmails his CO, but finds himself on the wrong end of a con and is forced into battle against a vicious invasion by aliens known as \"Mimics\". The weapon created to fight these Mimics is a battle suit which Cage has not been trained to use. Dropped down in an invasion called \"Operation Downfall\" on his first day, Cruise stumbles through the battlefield, which is an apparent trap for the human forces, when he comes face-to-face with an Alpha Mimic. Cage takes a claymore mine and plants it between himself and the Alpha, killing them both. But Cage wakes up at the beginning of his day back at the barracks. Despite his best attempts to warn the military of the coming battle, each time he wakes up, he ends up back in the battlefield one way or another. But when he meets Vretaski on the battlefield, who recognizes Cage's condition, advises him to find her when he wakes up. After every death, Cage finds Vretaski who trains Cage in using the combat suit. Together, they concoct a plan to end the war.\n\nEdge of Tomorrow was everything a summer sci-fi movie should be. It was exciting, intriguing, and action packed. The special effects were definitely on par with what we have come to expect from a movie of this magnitude, and at times was even surprising. Doug Liman's direction shines in some of the way he orchestrated the interactions between the characters. This movie is a must-see this summer, which unfortunately is not getting the audience it deserves.\n\nOne of the reason this movie is under-performing, although it is successful, is its marketing. The trailers for Edge of Tomorrow were not broadly appealing. After watching the movie, however, I understand why the trailers had to be very vague in their depictions of the film-- if the any of the major plot spoilers had been given to me before hand, I'm not sure if I would have found it as entertaining. One of the biggest surprises for me in Edge of Tomorrow was how funny it was at times. There was never any indication in any preview that this movie would have a sense of humor, but maybe that's even a good thing. I still enjoy going to the movies and being surprised by a movie. Too often lately trailers have been showing us everything and so at the very least I applaud Warner Brothers for keeping this movie's heart and plot close to the chest. \n\nOverall, this movie stands its ground with the blockbuster kings of the summer of 2014 so far, and it is certainly a must-see. Without hesitation, I give Edge of Tomorrow an A.\n\nFinal Grade: A",

It has a hint of 'I Am Legend' (2007) and in the story it resembles somewhat the film 'Source Code' (2011). Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, as always.

However, the film is very entertaining and will keep the audience engaged throughout. It does kind of remind me of movies like Source Code, Ground Hog Day, Memento, The Matrix, Total Recall, Terminator Salvation, Avatar, Saving Private Ryan, and Starship Troopers.  \n\nThe film is visually stunning and has great special effects. The major negative that I had with the film is that some of the action sequences happen too fast and it is hard to tell what just happened or who got killed. Filmmakers need to slow down the action in action scenes so that the audience can clearly see what happened.\n\nActing wise, Cruise delivers a terrific performance. I love the change that his character goes through, from the beginning of the film all the way till the end. He kind of reminded me of Guy Pearce in Memento or Arnold in Total Recall. Emily Blunt does an awesome job here. She holds her own opposite Cruise. She has a great on screen chemistry with Cruise.\n\nThe mimics reminded me of the sentinels of the Matrix or even the killer bugs from Starship Troopers. The suits that Tom and Emily wear reminded me of the suits worn in the Matrix and Avatar.\n\nI definitely recommend this film.",

As head of media relations it is major Cage's job to sell the war to future soldiers. When Cage is asked to produce an item on the beach of France to show the frontlines, he kindly refuses. That seems not an option and Cage is arrested for dissertation.\n\nWhen Cage wakes up he finds himself in a training facility near London Heathrow. Even though he tries to explain himself to commanding officers, he is still forced in to battle on the beach. This fight seems to be a suicide mission and Cage ends up dead almost instantly. His death seems to reset the time from the moment he wakes up at the training facility. Cage finds himself in the same battle over and over again. Leaning from the reoccurrence of events, Cage manages to improve himself as a soldier. Together with the Angel of Verdunn, Rita Vrataski (Blunt), he tries to find a way to end this war.\n\nLiman borrows the plot of Edge of Tomorrow from the manga All You Need is Kill. The manga influences are still present in this adaptation of the manga. Rita Vrataski, the heroine, carries a giant sword in to combat as a symbol of her militancy. Instead of the machineguns carried by the other 'simple' soldiers. Limans film also has a strong resemblance with another movie: Groundhog Day. And this is by no means a bad thing. Cruise relives the day as he gets killed time after time resulting in a lot of dark humorous scenes. This also gives an extra dimension to the film. It's not just a hero who tries and succeeds in trying to save the day, he is also learning from trying and failing as well.\n\nThen there is Cruise's character, Cage. Cage is not the type of person we are used to see Cruise playing. The wannabe army major, who has not been in combat for a second in his life is not the determent hero Cruise normally plays. Phrases like \"How do I turn the safety off?\" while on battlegrounds and the reoccurrence of humorous deaths by for instance rolling under a Humvee make this character an interesting one to watch. The complementation of Cruise's character by Blunt's character Rita plays out nicely. The somewhat strange powers of this weird guy, together with the will and strength of the tough woman.\n\nBut this is where the fun ends. The first halve of Edge of Tomorrow is innovatory. There is humor, decent dialogue and character development. The first half borrows all the good things from the manga and Groundhog Day and puts these together in a great storyline. Unfortunately the second half of Edge of Tomorrow lacks these factors. Without this, the attention is drawn to the not so good side-characters and the trial and error that seems to have made major cage in to a real fighting machine. All this is not very convincing.\n\n \n\nWith Edge of Tomorrow Liman produces a decent adaptation of the manga. The dark humor and strong roles from Cruise and Blunt make Edge of Tomorrow an interesting movie to watch. It is however the second half that pulls the final score of this movie a bit down. All in all Edge of Tomorrow is a movie worth watching for both the film enthusiast and the action movie lover.",

You see, this isn't the first time.\n\nLuego de ver el trailer, pens\u00e9 que iba a ser simplemente otra pel\u00edcula t\u00edpica de Tom Cruise, especialmente luego de Oblivion, pero con la cantidad de criticas positivas, decid\u00ed darle un chance, y quede sorprendida.\nEdge of Tomorrow es una pel\u00edcula de ciencia ficci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 inspirada en varias de este g\u00e9nero, y a pesar de no ser original, igualmente logra crear algo genial y entretenido. Cage (Tom Cruise) es un oficial que es obligado a entrar a combate, sin tener preparaci\u00f3n previa, ya que la tierra est\u00e1 en alerta roja luego de que los aliens se apoderaran de ella. Al llegar a el campo de batalla muere, y pero inmediatamente de eso vuelve a despertar en el mismo lugar en el que se encontraba antes de haber sido enlistado. Luego de pasar por el mismo proceso varias veces, conoce a una mujer llamada Rita (Emily Blunt) que le dice \"come find me when you wake up\" antes de morir por en\u00e9sima vez. Al conseguirla, ambos se embarcan en una viaje que tiene como finalidad salvar a la humanidad. \n\nEsta pel\u00edcula fue una gran experiencia cinematogr\u00e1fica, y fue un gran logro haber logrado hacer el m\u00e9todo de repetici\u00f3n efectivo, y hasta exprimirle comedia a toda la situaci\u00f3n. En ese aspecto al edici\u00f3n fue excepcional, ya que hubiera sido f\u00e1cil que no fuera exitoso.  Siento que mucha de la resistencia que tiene el p\u00fablico a ver esta pel\u00edcula es Tom Cruise, ya que no es ning\u00fan secreto que su reputaci\u00f3n ha sido afectada por su vida personal, pero no se puede negar que es simplemente una estrella de cine. El esfuerzo que le pone a cada una de sus pel\u00edculas es palpable, y es admirable el hecho de que ya esta en sus 50s y sigue realizando sus propias escenas de acci\u00f3n. Emily Blunt, estuvo genial y cre\u00edble como est\u00e1 guerrera, y disfrute de su personaje, porque no es la t\u00edpica hero\u00edna que depende de un hombre para su supervivencia, sino que es una mujer independiente y que toma cargo de la situaci\u00f3n.\n\nRecomiendo Edge of Tomorrow, ya que fue una pel\u00edcula entretenida ante todo, las escenas de acci\u00f3n fueron impresionantes y los personajes son totalmente cre\u00edbles, y una de las mejores cualidades, es que de hecho temes que el h\u00e9roe vaya a morir. Lo \u00fanico que tendr\u00eda que criticar es el final, ya que fue predecible, pero igual no le quita m\u00e9rito. Esta ha sido una de las sorpresas este a\u00f1o, que ha estado lleno de pel\u00edculas notables de \"superh\u00e9roes\".",

            "content": "Tom Cruise has recently taken an interest in sci-fi projects, as 2013's 'Oblivion' proved, and he continues this trend with 2014's 'Edge of Tomorrow.' Directed by Doug Liman, 'Tomorrow' finds Cruise as an officer in the U.S. Army, responsible for media relations as the world battles an alien race known as the mimics, which have spread across Europe with no signs of letting up. When he incidentally ends up on the front lines, things go awry, and he ends up in a Groundhog Day-esque cycle of dying within five minutes of landing on the battlefield and waking up the previous day to find out he's back where he started. The plot is pretty interesting, and execution is good, as well. Cruise does a good job, but no worse nor better than usual. Emily Blunt, on the other hand, steals the show as Sergeant Rita Vrataski (know more commonly among the privates as the \"full metal bitch\"). Together, she and Cruise dominate the screen time, and that's not a bad thing. The action sequences are almost constant, but not overdone like they are in many other similar films. Possibly the greatest scenes are not those on the battlefield but the ones where Cruise and Blunt are alone, talking about the situation they're faced with how to come out of it alive. Also, there's plenty of subject matter to make audiences think. By no means is 'Tomorrow' an intelligent film, but it's not a dumbed down CGI-fest, either (looking at you, Michael Bay...). 'Edge of Tomorrow' is not great, but it's good - good enough to entertain without leaving too much of a dissatisfying taste.",

            "content": "Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.\n\nMost unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character - and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.\n\nYet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as \"full metal bitch\" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before. \n\nAs for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was (it IS breathtaking, though).\n\nSo my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years, 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "Not only is this one of the best films of the year, this is one of the best science fiction films in recent memory. Tom Cruise proves once again that although the faltered quite a bit with 2012's OBLIVION, he can still lead a fantastic blockbuster unlike anyone else. EDGE OF TOMORROW is a fantastic film based off of the acclaimed short novel (and later popular Manga) ALL YOU NEED IS KILL. The story follows Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) as he's forced into active duty in war against an alien race against his will. When he dies approximately five minutes after arriving on the battlefield, he finds himself waking up exactly one day earlier with everything happening the way it previously did except his memory of dying and the previous version of the current day is still intact. He must then find out how this is happening and what it means in terms of winning the war once and for all with the help of the war's most decorated and skilled soldiers played by Emily Blunt.\nThe direction by Doug Liman is absolutely fantastic and so confident which was crucial and a film of this nature. If there was anything wrong with the direction, the film's themes and over-played sequences of the same day from slightly different angles would come off repetitive in the worst way and just plain boring/lazy. Fortunately, we have Liman in complete control of the film and it clearly shows. Tom Cruise is playing a different type of hero than we are used to seeing him play and it works excellently. His character, Major Cage has a real arc going from coward to hero without it feeling forced or unearned at all as we see him grow as a person and especially as a soldier. Emily Blunt is fantastic as Sergeant Rita Vrataski who is a great addition to strong independent female badasses among the likes of ALIENS-era Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton in T2. She plays her part so well and natural that the physicality and tough manner to her character feel natural to the actress. While Cruise and Blunt do excellent work with their characters, they work just as well together with a ease in their chemistry and a great sense of play when Blunt's character is training Cruise over and over and over again.\nAside from the fantastic direction and great acting, the overall story of the film is very fascinating in terms of originality and validity. It never feels too complicated or too overstuffed to the point of it being too much to comprehend. The film knows what it wants to establish and whatever the plot needs to explain is never over or under-explained. The film is as original as Hollywood can be these days and that is due to the wonderful use of limited time travel by keeping it a single frame of time and always reverting back to the same place. If there is one thing that keeps the film from being perfect it is the somewhat forced resolution to cruise and blunts characters. If you've ever seen a movie when the guy and the girl begin not liking each other, you know they end up together. In the film, Blunt's character is strong willed, independent and above the typical female character in an action film needing a man. At the end of the film, I felt they gave her a little too much of it. (Let's just say the \"romance\" resolution PACIFIC RIM is what this film should have used.) EDGE OF TOMORROW is nonetheless a stellar piece of science fiction and a great film all around. Tom Cruise give one of his best performances with Emily Blunt proving herself to be a worthy female lead with a knack for action. RATING: A",

            "content": "Groundhog Day meets sci-fi D Day, awesomeness ensues. That's the short version of Edge of Tomorrow. The somewhat longer version is that five years after a meteor strike brought the mimics- a species of shape shifting alien tentacle creatures- to earth, all of mankind's remaining armies are poised for a massive offensive to retake Europe and exterminate the alien menace. But they know we're coming. The invasion will be a slaughter. And only one man can save humanity, by living and dying it over and over again.\n\n\tThat man is Major William Cage, US Army press corps. As a savior, he's about as unlikely as they come. Fast talking and cowardly, it's only because of his own insubordination and equally underhanded shenanigans of a superior officer that ever ends up holding a gun. But something happens on the invasion beach which makes it so when he dies, time resets and he wakes up again the day before the invasion. Working together with war hero Rita Vrataski, the only other person who what he's going through, he must find a way to turn the tide and save humanity. \n \n\tThat's just the setup. What director Doug Liman and his team of writers do with it is spectacular. Adapting the acclaimed Japanese novel All You Need is Kill, they're created a sci-fi action thriller that is not only action packed and exciting, but also complex, witty, and surprisingly deep. The time loop William is caught in isn't merely used as a plot device, it shapes the entire narrative and viewing experience. \n\n\tEvery time he dies and reawakens he comes back more skilled and with the knowledge avoid his previous death. Not that it necessarily gets him more than a few steps farther. At times the cycles flash by with nearly identical deaths, like an eighties training montage with more explosions and head wounds. Before long he has the assault down to an exact science, anticipating every attack and coaching Rita through the battle step by step- turn here, look there, duck now! There's no way to get an exact count, but he must hit that beach thousands of times over the course of the story. Sometimes the effect is darkly comedic. At others it drives home his sense of futility; that no matter how many times he tries it will never be enough. \n\n\tThe film of course doesn't show nearly every cycle, so when a new- really new- scene begins, we often don't know if this is his first time to make it this far or if he's been here a dozen times. The other characters of course have no idea what's come before. Every time he introduces himself to Rita it's the first time for her. Throughout the film he comes to know her better and better and loses her too many times to count, yet for her he's always a new face, one that she has to trust knows her and knows what he's doing. Still, there's an undeniable attraction between them that runs both way, made tragic by their circumstances.\n\n\tEdge of tomorrow works a comedy and drama. As a sci-fi action thriller it excels.  Fast paced and intense, the battle scenes turn repetitiveness from a weakness to a strength, giving a sense of Cage's progression and adding new twists to the same encounters. The robotic exoskeletons are every bit as cool as they look in the trailers, and the mimics are one of the best alien designs in recent memory. Constantly shifting and incredibly fast, they burst from the ground and whirl through opponents like a tornado of tentacles. They have no personality and most seem more like animals fighting on instinct than independent thought, but in their own way they're as deadly and unnerving as Alien's xenomorph.\n\n\tCruise and Blunt's performances are also noteworthy. Quite at ease in this role, Cruise has a certain roguish charm to him and embodies both the terrified rookie of the early scenes and the experienced, jaded veteran of the latter sections. Emily Blunt is likewise perfect for the role of Rita Vrataski. Gorgeously fit and tough as nails, she's reminiscent of a young Sigourney Weaver and handles alien monsters just as well. I almost pity any mimic that crosses her path. Together their performances, an abundance of action, and a finely crafted, fast paced story make Edge of Tomorrow fun, smart summer entertainment.",

Cruise is excellent (which grinds on me somewhat, as I really don't like the guy - but his talent is undeniable), and Blunt is effective and agile in her first action blockbuster.

Stunning action sequences litter the story from nearly start to finish. Yet, somehow they are able to balance this with the humor, albeit dark, of the situation without detracting from the former. The result is, in a word, Awesome. \n\nI have to say, it was interesting seeing Tom Cruise as a weenie for once. That was something I wasn't quite sure about going in, but Emily Blunt and him work off their acting strengths delivering something special. Allowing them to push the story forward by not only being fantastic but smart. This is a lesson that has been lost to most films of this genre. Sci-Fi does not have to be watered down to appease the masses. Audiences, I believe, are smarter than that and don't need to be spoon-fed mindless explosions and destruction for a movie to be great. It's ok to have a story too. I hope that Hollywood is taking notes. \n\nSpeaking of which, for the exuberant amount of complaints that Hollywood is out of original ideas, it's a wonder that the grumblers rarely support an original story that is adapted to the big screen. I'm sure that having Tom Cruise attached to this probably has something to do with it, but bottom line: Tom Cruise makes great movies. Out of every actor living or dead, I'm sure I own more titles that he has starred in than any other (And I know I'm not the only one who can say that). You shouldn't restrict yourself from seeing a movie just because you disagree with something they've done in their personal life. But, hey, if you can't get over it than just think.... At least you get to see him die over and over ;-)",

It presents tropes and then plays around them instead of letting them take over. It cheats with some of the science, but keeps the story loose and entertaining. It even touches on big themes of fate and making the most of life, but overall it's simply great fun.\nCruise plays a Lt. Col. during a future alien invasion, more focused on PR than actual fighting. When he's unceremoniously dropped and killed in the midst of battle, he discovers his regeneration \"gift\", repeatedly reliving the same day (think \"Groundhog Day\" but action-y). Each time he restarts, he learns a little more about himself and the enemy. \nThe action and effects are majestic and realistic, with a surprising respect for warfare, with aliens who are scary, unique, and cool, but what really makes EoT work is Cruise. He performs against the rock-solid action star type he has tended towards in recent years, instead playing a squirrelly, vulnerable, and comedic character with refreshing effortlessness. His opening fear is palpable, and his eventual transformation into a fierce warrior is steady and believable thanks to great direction and committed acting.\nThis is a modern premise with an 80s sensibility, never losing the fun while juggling the philosophy. The space-time continuum problems and moments of clich\u00e9d dialogue are overlooked by the below-the-surface tongue-in-cheek spirit that permeates the entire film. EoT is a twisty, rewarding, funny, and deftly made summer blockbuster.",
