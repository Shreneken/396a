    "summary": "A classic of the silent age, this film tells the story of the doomed but ultimately canonized 15th-century teenage warrior. On trial for claiming she'd spoken to God, Jeanne d'Arc (Renee Falconetti) is subjected to inhumane treatment and scare tactics at the hands of church court officials (Eugene Silvain, Jean d'Yd). Initially bullied into changing her story, Jeanne eventually opts for what she sees as the truth. Her punishment, a famously brutal execution, earns her perpetual martyrdom.",

Falconetti's face is so expressive, and the way the inquisitors are shot is so terrifying and creepy that it is impossible to turn away even when we want to. Nearly 100 years old, the film is still remarkably fresh in its cinematography, and a must see.",

            "content": "What truly brings out a picture? The captured moment, or how it turned out, between grayscale and color? Color emphasizes the momentous vibrations, while grayscale emphasizes the prominent details. The cinema had to stick with the latter from its birth breakthrough till the former was enabled by technological evolution - while the talkies disrupt the stills by adding vocal dimension. The silents pioneers cinematic storytelling when not rolling a screen in front of Vaudeville's usual platform, but both share the cinematographed choices of expressing advances within a story, juxtaposing with title cards for necessary translation. The details emphasized mainly focus on the performers' expressions because the situation tonally resonates through them while the accompanied music expresses it till amplification verifies the occurring tension. The silent historical powerhouse \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" reminds those notions upfront, mainly driven by Renee Jeanne Falconetti's emotionally driven performance.\n\nJoan of Arc is a patron saint of France, a 15th century teenage warrior who defended her people against the English during the Hundred Years' War, transcending gender roles and receiving visions reinforcing her leadership capabilities till faith was lost against her. Her factual profile here begins after her capture, put on trial for claiming she's connected to God, accused by religious bigots of blasphemy to the holy name under satanic control. Even through inhumane treatment and scare tactics by the church court officials, pressured to change her story which is her belief she only sees as truth, she faces a brutal execution as punishment. What they didn't realize is that they're the ones who get questioned as she, a saint who cares about the people, earns her perpetual martyrdom.\n\nEither you heard about her tale or just the film itself over its high rankings, it doesn't deter from her sealed fate, meaning the end already been acknowledged even stated in the opening pretexts just to throw a significant idea of her importance. The film actually acts like a courtroom drama, pioneering the subgenre's structural effect, with strong solid arguments firing up the tension while rooting for the rebellious side's defense against pretentious ignorance. Joan expresses spiritual individualism, aiming criticism towards religious men who are scared of things they have yet to comprehend as they're being taught through sudden revelations. As the film is entirely based on the trial's actual records, condensing down its length down to a single day, only few honest good men let their emotions known while others posed heartlessly without knowing how they really feel than how they left it to interpretive speculations depicting them as heartless, unless it's an historical tag based on researched awareness. Especially during the final moments as the aftermath of Joan's fiery death witnessed by France, spurring riotously, shows reactive lengths as the film's violent core in almost similar juxtaposing fashion to Sergei Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\" but less graphic.\n\nWhile the story of Joan of Arc will always be passed through generations, Dreyer's direction is a definitive resurrection for the figure's stance, magnificently captured by Falconetti's emotionally driven performance. Her expressions speak nuances, saying it all through well-decided cinematography under insisted focus, following a riveting, empowering script with thorough delicacy regarding her case, then stroked by the given music as further expressions. It's this synergy geared around Falconetti, at her finest hour as her final (and accessibly only) film role, that powered the film's recognition besides glimpsing into Joan's earlier life. If we join the research Dreyer did in knowing the subject, we might be able to translate those facially expressive nuances.\n\nEven though the full [and original] version is lost, the stirred recognition stemmed from the version that still garners passionate filmmakers and becoming parts of cinephiles both fascinations and studies. \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" is indeed a timeless classic over its storytelling angles, proving to be quite a powerhouse to behold, and might be able to immerse in theatrical form. It offers like any courtroom drama, at utmost factuality, and concise historical biography, but as a silent film with astonishing power finds a transitional apparatus. Any appreciation towards those tags above, across differential forms, would enjoy it more than casual discoveries. (A-)",

This honesty is perfectly captured on Falconetti's face and really captures the emotional turmoil of Joan of Arc and really portrays her character with an unheard of sense of realism. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer, whose films are always a beautiful display of black and white evocative imagery, delivers what is considered his greatest work and one of the greatest films ever made with The Passions of Joan of Arc! He captures the real story of Joan of Arc in medium and close-up shots that are more a series of images than the usual flow associated with filming, and no establishing shots are seen but instead we are thrown straight into the circumstance of Joan of Arc. The film is minimalistic in it's story but beautifully filmed and each shot is done with great care and complexity. This is an amazing and haunting piece of cinema and is amazing considering there is no audio or sound whatsoever, only imagery and really that's all it needs, however a score was inspired and made for the film as well. A must see If you are into cinema and want a masterful film viewing of the Silent Film era!",

It is a historical film that tells an effective story with what was available at the time.

Maria Falconetti gives one of the most memorable performances in film history with just the various expressions in her eyes. This film feels sad the whole way through but it is still a fascinating look at historical events. It tells a story in a way that even the filmmakers of today could learn a thing or two from. Overall, this film is probably one of the most impressive ones I have seen from the 1920s silent film era and I think all film enthusiasts should watch and admire it.",

            "content": "Moving beyond words.\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer's Danish silent film The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) is a stunning piece of cinema. He recounts the trial, torture, and murder or Jeanne D'Arc of France, more commonly known as Joan of Arc. The Passion of Joan of Arc bears a striking empathy for her inner religious turmoil as The Catholic Church demands she signs a statement against her morals and beliefs. Carl Theodor Dreyer and Joseph Delteil's writing is sympathetic to how Joan feels in each moment of agonized conflict over her faith for God versus her human suffering. Every line is referenced from her actual trial records and is brilliantly smart and powerful. \n\nDreyer's direction feels quite modern as he focuses entirely on face reaction shots and the emotional connection the viewer has with the martyred Joan. Rudolph Mate's black and white cinematography looks gorgeous with expressive and emotionally revealing close-ups of face from all angles. Each shot looks perfectly framed for conveying Dreyer's script and the painful history of religious violence. Few films express such poignant suffering and depth as The Passion of Joan of Arc.\n\nRenee Jeanne Falconetti is a fearless French actress, who gives her all as Jeanne D'Arc. Her lead actress role is incredibly powerful with endless real tears, eyes wide open, meaningful head tilts, mouth agape in agony, and other subtle acting techniques. Her acting will never be topped as Joan of Arc because Falconette feels so real in her raw performance from The Passion of Joan of Arc. Falconetti acts like she's in a 1970's drama way back in the more impressionistic days of 1928. She's seriously astonishing. You can see all the men around her are bursting with rage and a few with gentle sympathy, but her acting is years ahead of her silent film era.\n\nThe 24 fps version doesn't feel too sped up, but you can watch the more natural 20 fps version on The Criterion Collection's restored and remastered blu-ray. Ole Schmidt, Jesper Kyd, Victor Alix, and Léo Pouget composed the different scores. I highly recommend the beautiful score from Voices of Light to add a heavy choir vocals, orchestral gravitas, and sense of purpose. The symphonic swells bolster each moment of pain and amplify the tragedy of Joan's short life and incredibly faithful heroism. It's lovely to hear, but also keeps the pace quick for this brisk 81 minute iconic historical drama. Carl Theodor Dreyer and Marguerite Beauge's editing is swiftly cut for a 1928 feature as no shot lingers too long, giving The Passion of Joan of Arc a fast pace. Lastly, Valentine Hugo's costumes look period accurate and give a unique look to this silent classic.\n\nI certainly recommend seeing The Passion of Joan of Arc as it's simply one of the most beautiful pictures I've ever had the pleasure of watching.",

            "content": "By far the oldest film I've pocket-reviewed, The Passion of Joan of Arc pioneered what the \"close-up\" means and provides a haunting account of Joan's (Renée Jeanne Falconetti) trial and execution by using the actual transcripts pulled from the archives. The rumors that surround the film also lend to its importance, as the literal film of Dreyer's original cut was lost for decades, only for a copy to resurface in Oslo in 1981. Dreyer was known for his borderline-abusive directing style that absolutely would not fly today — his working relationship with Renée Jeanne Falconetti during shooting has been described as both \"sadist\" and \"normal\". I suppose that's an effect of it being 93 years old. Lastly, Falconetti only has one other acting credit to her name, as she took to the stage, eventually fleeing the Nazis and ending up in Argentina where she tragically died from an eating disorder at fifty-four. Okay, the movie, a French silent film that uses so many close-ups it becomes suffocating, and that's the point. We never see Joan on the battlefield, but solely in front of dozens of men, always literally looking down on her with, at best, suspicion, but mostly with contempt — a couple do feel for her, trying to save her life (not just her soul) and one even flings himself at her feet, declaring her a saint. The inquisition is heavy on the devil-speak and many a threat o'torture, as any true medieval inquisition should. Her judges become obsessed with the fact that she wears men's clothing that at times they seem to care more about her wardrobe than whether Satan had commanded her on the battlefield. Perhaps it was the combination of the Gregorian chant and Falconetti's giant, marble eyes, but the film puts you on the verge of tears and anger throughout. The Passion of Joan of Arc didn't invent the close-up, but redefined it, changing filmmaking forever. I simply can't do its power justice in print, so watch a clip and explanation from Cinefix here. I had assumed that it would be melodramatic, given that they don't speak the way we watch today, but the acting, plot of injustice, what's at stake (no pun intended) make it required viewing for the cinephile and history buff. When asked along the lines of \"why?\" she took up her crusade and she responded, \"To save France.\" I wanted to search for any English to drive out of my neighborhood.",

As the title suggests, Dreyer treats the subject matter as a passion play, with obvious visual parallels to the crucifixion.  Despite how reportedly uncomfortable the Catholic church was with the film when it was first released, the churchmen in the film are not presented as mindless zealots, but rather as a group of men with a variety of doubts and opinions about Joan's claims but not, of course, about what to do with her when she ultimately stands by her 'blasphemous' position.",

            "content": "Silent films are always a challenge for me, because there needs to be something compelling in the way the narrative is presented that draws me in since I don’t have some of the more traditional things I cling to in a modern movie. For this reason, most of my favorite silent films are comedies, because physical humor translates without anything spoken. I was quite worried when I started The Passion of Joan of Arc because it felt like so much of the movie was intertitles. With silent films I feel there is a tipping point where too many title cards start to pop up and my brain begins to think “Maybe I should just read a book on this subject, because they don’t seem to be utilizing the visual medium of film as much as they are just showing expository text.” Thankfully, this didn’t last long. It seems the early scenes are designed to set up the narrative, so that the visuals can do the story-telling the rest of the way through. In fact, at one point I was wishing for a title card (to spell out the words in the note she is asked to sign) and they didn’t give me one. I was certainly impacted by the story of The Passion of Joan of Arc, because it is a great historical tale of injustice and martyrdom. You can’t avoid feeling sympathy for her character, particularly since about half the film is just close-ups of Maria Falconetti staring into the middle distance in different states of sorrow, shock, and horror. This makes it almost impossible to escape the emotion of the events unfolding, because we are forced to watch the toll it is taking on this poor woman. The constant conniving of the religious leaders overseeing her trial is devastating, and I suspect a bit mild compared to the way this thing actually unfolded in 1431. In many ways it reminded me of films I’ve seen about the trials of Jesus prior to his crucifixion, and it elicited a similar emotional reaction from me. That being said, while I was impacted by The Passion of Joan of Arc, and I recognize some of the wonderful film-making, it wasn’t exactly my cup of tea. It is so depressing, and the endless shots of her teary eyes were hard to take. It’s a film I feel appreciative I’ve seen once, but I can’t say I’d want to see it again.",

I find myself somewhere in the middle. It's a great movie for how much it manages to accomplish with so little. We feel Joan's anxiety through the whole nerve wrecking trial. It does start to loose its effect near the end though, as we see yet another close up of Joan's teary eyed face.

The story focuses on just her trial and execution, which has the advantage that it makes the film taut and Kafkaesque, but the disadvantage that additional context would have told a richer story.  Do we really see Jeanne d'Arc here?  I'm not so sure, historical transcript notwithstanding, though I did find it fascinating that she refused to change out of her men's clothing.  While performances are strong and the film is ahead of its time, the content is dark, and not particularly uplifting, especially if you're a non-believer.  There is of course a universal theme in a righteous person standing up to persecution - being mocked, threatened, and tortured - but at the end of the day, it's simple Jeanne, believing she was sent by God, standing up against the established clergy, who, threatened by her assertions, believe she was sent by the Devil.  The film never ponders whether both may be deluded, and concludes with her soul being protected by the flames as it rises to heaven.    Watch this one for Dreyer's craft and Falconetti's performance.",

            "content": "The Passion of Joan of Arc is an emotionally-devastating, powerful, and transcends far beyond being merely a film watching experience. There are no words to describe what it is like to watch this film, as it truly feels like a religious experience that most other religiously-themed films cannot even begin to match (Suck it, Kirk Cameron and Pureflix). The story is about Joan of Arc's trial for heresy before her inevitable execution. It's about testing the ultimate limits of faith even in the face of death and pure evil, religious hypocrisy, and even showing the goodness in others even dark times, such as a beautiful scene shortly before her execution when she interacts with a priest who shows great compassion to her. While the story is simple, it is the stunning direction, cinematography, and most of all, Renee Falconetti's performance as Joan which makes you believe every moment and you feel every moment. It is a flawless performance and a monument to the towering heights of acting. You will never forget her face and you will never forget the experience because she is that powerful in her role. The film is also bolstered by Richard Einhorn's retroactive score, \"Voices of Light\" in which he manages to perfectly capture the film's soul and essence. Carl Theodor Dreyer would be proud, Mr. Einhorn. I can gush as much as I want, or how I will even admit it's one of the few films that made me cry, but there are no words that do this film justice. It is something to be experienced.",

It's very close in technique and quality to the finest films ever made (I've seen several of these) but unlike any of those, I have watched or listened to (in the background, the silent film backed by Rickert Einhorne's inspired composition \"Vox de Lumine\") \"The Passion\" now some dozen times in the last two days. It is not just a triumph of cinema, it is so good that it is more like a mark of finish, where watching it is like breaking a tape at the end of an endless marathon, being done, and knowing that a struggle of importance is now over and that some spectacle of taste has gone behind.\n\nThe emission of faces from the lens seems endless at first, and is striking because it is so uncomfortable to be so close to so many subjects under such conditions, where the situation is both so tense and so pathetic at once. But you get used to being close to these endless faces because it is worthwhile seeing them. I cannot understand what autism or other mental fracture caused this film's contemporary critics to shout down the profound use of close-up shots, but I can comprehend that they probably lacked something in the mind that allows one to deal with the unexpected. Perhaps they should have never been born to become reviewers, because to me such condemnations resemble the person who enjoys the habit of spilling beans because they are better at picking them up than carrying them and as a side they more enjoy counting things than being useful. The over-intracted, puppet-like film critic who is out to suckle the teats of the professors at film school must really revel in a film such as this because it breaks so much convention but without falling from grace. If the film breaks convention and is miserable and not worth watching, it's not worth commenting on and it is not worth breaking your neck over spinning about how awful it was directed. But if the film breaks convention and is powerful and magnetizing such as \"The Passion\" is, then the ardently trained and quiet-minded film school stalwart has endless fodder to smirch the film with at equal proportion to the energy they have not spent on their own imagination.\n\nIt is not enough to call a film like this \"ahead of its time\" or even more aptly \"ahead of the time\" (meaning, \"ahead of this time\".) For a film like this it could even be said, and honestly, that \"it should not have been made\", and the statement need not even require clarification as to whether life and cinema would be better or worse in the film's absence. Both are directly implied and only a person of sufficient imagination can appreciate that level of criticism, can see the possibilities and understand the rapport. It is with such open-mindedness and such acceptance of both the good and bad in life that a simple observation can influence the lives of many people and yet remain nothing more than its original, simple roots all the while, and that is what this film is exactly.",

            "content": "A contemporary moviegoer might contemplate as to whether he should spent his time with those silent films that the hardcore cinephiles hold in high esteem. The simple fact that those movies stood a near-century long test of time, competing in such a productive medium as cinema is, should be enough for anyone to give them a chance. I would like to add another point to that; silent movies are like the superhero Daredevil.\n\nYou heard (read) me; Of course I don't mean that they are in high demand in Netflix -they certainly are not, what I mean is  that if you take away from someone one of his primary functions, his survival instinct with heighten the remaining. Filmmakers at the beginning of the previous century, had in their disposal as many wonderful tales to tell, as filmmakers of today do. The problem, of course, is that they had limited means to tell them; not only the films were silent, but the technology offered little help in their endeavor. \n\nThe visionary directors of that time didn't give up. Instead they transcended their infant medium by offering innovative narratives and superb imagery. The plunge into madness that Das cabinet des Dr. Caligari (The cabinet of Dr. Caligari - 1920) was, the beautiful Körkarlen (The phantom carriage - 1921), and of course, from the creator of this film Carl Dreyer, the disturbing Vampyr (1932), are all excellent examples of the beauty that silent cinema has to offer. \n\nSo I had my hopes up, when this film started; and it didn't disappoint. It begins with Dreyer's innovative narration; close-ups to the actor's faces in contrast with a minimalistic background, loitered with just a hint of surrealism. The faces themselves were great portrayals of their owner's state of mind; Jeanne appeared exhausted, but defiant and the stony, inquisitive faces of the clergy, seemed to surround her, creating a beautiful aesthetic. The expressive face of Maria Falconetti, who played Jeanne, depicts her emotions with precision and the juxtaposition with her captors's judgmental looks highlighted every emotion she felt. \n\nUnfortunately, this is the point were the praise stops. I will begin the enumeration of the movie's faults with the story. Well, there is none. From the first minute, the movie informs us, that it will be a recount of the final stage of Jeanne's trial and the moment of her death at the stake. Given the nature of the unconventional narration, the fact that there is no story could be forgiven. Dreyer wanted us to have a unique experience and his dedication is evident throughout the film. \n\nThe main flaw of this movie is that after the first few minutes, when the awe of the innovation subsides, we are stuck with repetition. For -seemingly- countless minutes, we witness Jeanne squint-eyed and wide-eyed while she contracts her face muscles, under the icy stares of her captors. I just described 80 out of the 90 minutes of the film's duration. \n\nDreyer used the technique again in Vampyr, providing us with a memorable scene where we watch a close up of a young girl's face after she wakes up from her stupor and feels the grasp of vampirism she was afflicted with. Dreyer proves that sparing use of the technique can provide great scenes, but in this film he it constantly, making the film unbearable.\n\nThe acts themselves are repetitive; the recurring theme is the clergy trying to make Jeanne bow to their will and her refusing. All during close ups. \n\nMoreover, the captioned dialogue emphasizes the film's stagnation; The clergy's accusations are basically the same all the time and Jeanne's replies lack eloquence. Her only interesting response, is her reply to the question \"are you in  state of grace right now?\". Given the film's minimalism and attention to detail, I expected better writing. \n\nThe ending is a well-shot scene, beautifully opposite to the rest of the film's rhythm, but maybe I just liked it because it signaled the film's end.\n\nConcluding, The Passion of Joan of Arc, after the first few minutes, failed to spark my interest or incite any kind of emotion from me (unless we count drowsiness). I am sure it has already educated generations of filmmakers and will continue to do so; the techniques used clearly have artistic merit and the whole film is a study in directorial meticulousness, but as an experience for the viewer, it fails miserably. 3.5/10.\n\nIf you desperately want to watch a silent film about witch-trials you can do better by watching Häxan (1922). The segments about the trials were more emotional and certainly more thought provoking. \n\nI'd like to add another point. The essence of the story is that a rebel leader was captured by authorities, controlled by those she rebelled against. Obviously she was going to be killed. That simple realization made me completely apathetic to the religious narrative and to the whole Jeanne d'Arc tale. Since her fate was sealed at the moment of her capture, I didn't care for the excuse they would use for executing her. I care even less that the clergy felt that their power was being undermined. Again,  Häxan did it much better.",

Dreyer führt uns das Gesicht von Renee Maria Falconetti vor - ein Erlebnis, um die gesammte Epoche des Stummfilms zu begreifen. Falconetti wurde von Dreyer auf der Bühne eines Pariser Boulevard-Theaters entdeckt entdeckt. Sie spielte nur in einem einzigen Film mit und der heisst The passion of Joan of Arc. Obwohl Dreyer sie in einer leichten Komödie sah, machte er Screen Tests und fand das, was er hoffte: Einfachheit, Wahrhaftigkeit und Leid. In Kobenhagen sieht man heute im Museum die ungewöhnlichen Bauten, die Dreyer für den Film fertigen liess. Dreyer verlangte nach einem einzigen Stück mit beweglichen Wänden für die Kameras, vier Türmen und einigen Kapellen sowie dem Gericht. Alles wirkt disharmonisch, doch wen wunderts, denn Dreyers Film entstand auf dem Höhepunkt des deutschen Expressionismus und der Pariser Avantgarde. Während wir die Geschichte der einfachen Frau vom Land erleben, die als Junge verkleidet die französischen Truppen gegen den britischen Feind anführt, sehen wir nie das ganze Set im Film, immer nur Teile davon. Genauso verwundert Dreyers Schnitt, der die Figuren im Zusammenspiel nicht in Relation zueinander setzt, sondern oft genau das Gegenteil probiert. Dreyers Film wirkt mehr wie eine Reihe einzelner Bilder. Oft kontrastieren sie; so sehen wir das Gesicht des Inquisitors in gleissendem Weiss, während das von Jeanne in weichem Grau erscheint. Ihr teilnahmsloses Gesicht deutet an, dass alles, was geschieht, den Bereich des Films weit hinter sich lässt. Antworten dürfen wir keine erwarten. Dreyer vermeidet mit seiner Technik, ihr Gesicht derartig zu fokussieren, das Genre des historischen Dramas, des Epos. Deshalb interessiert er sich auch nie für die Kostüme (obwohl sie authentisch sind). Aller Ausdruck des Films, wir finden ihn in Falconettis Gesicht! Unsere Zuneigung zu Jeanne, sie wächst ins Ungeheure, dadurch, dass wir so viel Geheimnis und Leidenschaft in ihren Augen zu entdecken hoffen. Die Bilder des Films gleichen ihren Gefühlen, sie wirken kalt, eschöpft, fast ausgehungert. Vielleicht ist das Dreyers Geheimnis: The passion of Joan of Arc ist ein Film über den Albtraum ihrer Gefühlswelt - und sonst nichts.",

Keeping everything tight, tense and claustrophobic, it draws out every emotion the characters are going through, and with the Directors insistence that none of the actors wear make-up, appearing entirely as nature intended, every expression is raw and unflinchingly real. \nThis is never more true than with the portrayal of the title character. Renée Maria Falconetti, appearing in her only major motion picture release, gives a performance so authentic and heart-breaking that it's often hard to believe that is actually is a performance. The tears, the smiles, the slow way she moves, her near-permanently widened eyes, everything about her screams inner anguish and torment. It's sometimes difficult to watch, considering just how much the actress suffered from genuine psychological issues, so the pain could have been more real than anyone knew.\nIt does have its faults unfortunately. Without the benefit of sound the film must frequently cut to screens of dialogue to spell out what is being said, which is often distracting and cuts short some of the emotions. Also, while it is very engaging, the fact that we spend most of it witnessing close ups of grumpy/tear stained faces can make it hard to get through. But as an experience, a timeless drama which explores the deepest despair of the human soul, it's a film that everyone simply has to see, if only once. It's certainly a tough journey, but it's one you'll be genuinely thrilled that you decided to take.",

Upon the canonization of Joan of Arc in 1920 director Dreyer was assigned to make a movie on Joan of Arc - Pierre Champion had already compiled and published transcript of 'trial of Joan of Arc' which became the subject-line for the film. Made on the mere budget of 7 million francs; film's production design though partially in glance yet plays the background for Rouen Castle, to which Dreyer had given a touch of French Avant-garde.  \r\n\r\nFilm was lost in late 1920s due to fire to warehouse where the original and negative copies of the film were both stored - however, in 1980s a copy was found in the mental asylum in Oslo in Janitor's shelf. It was sent to Norway Film Institute where it was edited and brought in close parity to original release.  \r\n\r\nBased on 500 years old trial of 19-year old French peasant girl Joan of Arc (1412 - 1431) who fought English to chase them out of France upon divine command, wearing men's uniform and short-hair (angering Englishmen) - she helped King Charles VII of France. She was burnt alive at stake after an infamous trial in which she suffered humiliation and tormenting behavior from powerful judges and men particularly pro-Englishmen. Renée Jeanne Falconetti (French stage actress - her only film) plays Joan of Arc (in one of the best performances ever in the history of cinema). \r\n\r\nRudolph Maté marvelous photography wins the show, providing unique style of close-up shots of actors; the expressions of shock and grief, the tearing eyes of Falconetti and her traumatized face without makeup and dry lips to keep the notoriety of an infamous trial and its expected after-effects. Tortures inflicted upon Falconetti by the English guards, sends chills down your spine. Dreyer uses splendid effects of German Expressionism and French Impressionism.",

What Dreyer accomplishes here is all thanks to his star, Maria Falconetti. Never has a role been executed to such an empathetic extent as Falconetti demonstrates here. You feel for her, more importantly, you feel her.\n\nThe Passion Of Joan Of Arc is haunting but it is never morbid nor is it depressing. In fact it is a lush example of filmmaking at its best, a director at his peak, and an actress in the role of a lifetime. The best scene Godard ever filmed was set in a movie theater. Godard filmed his actress, Anna Karina, watching The Passion of Joan Of Arc and becoming so deeply affected by it that she starts to weep. I weep almost every time I see Maria Falconetti. NO. Strike that. I weep almost every time Maria Falconetti sees me.\n\nI always love watching the early sound pictures from the great silent era directors. Another one of Dreyer's best work, in my opinion, was Vampyr, and the language the film tells itself in is purely of the silent era. While sound does exist in Vampyr, the images take center stage. Sound almost reveals itself as a cursed and wretched presence in the film. Vampyr is my favorite vampire tale ever filmed. And Vampyr is like the blurred and wounded brother to it's sisterly counterpart, The Passion Of Joan Of Arc. Together both Vampyr and The Passion Of Joan Of Arc tell a great deal about the soul of the man who made them. Both represent two very different sides to the man, yet viewed back to back provide both a coherent personality and a sympathetic heart. Carl Theodor Dreyer was the heart of early cinema. Dreyer was the master of light. His films are so powerful that they are literally stunning.",

            "content": "Facing the End With Strength  \r\n\r\nThis is a Great Movie.  It is hard to get the complete list of them up at the moment, because rogerebert.com is flooded today.  I think perhaps Roger himself would be surprised at how many people are mourning him and how personally.  I am listening right now to an interview with Werner Herzog, which happened to be in process when the news came.  It is deeply strange listening to Werner Herzog fighting back tears, but there he is.  I cannot tell you how many of them I have at home right now.  I've meant to make a database of this at some point, so I'm not so reliant on the site, but I haven't gotten around to it.  I'm so used to Roger's just being there.  I think most of us were.  I have read outpourings of emotion from thousands of people, probably, and there are doubtless many, many more that I haven't read.  I got three personal e-mails from him over the years, and they made me deeply happy.  I would not be here without him.\r\n\r\nThe year is 1431.  A young French peasant girl named Jeanne (Renée Jeanne Falconetti) led the army for her king and was captured.  She is brought before not the judges of England but the judges of the Church.  Jeanne is being prosecuted for heresy.  She dresses in men's clothing and says it is because God has commanded it.  She says that St. Michael the Archangel appeared to her and told her that she would lead the armies of France.  She says that God says that the English will all be driven out of France.  She is determined that this is what God has decreed.  Her interlocutors, however, do not believe her.  They demand to know how she can tell that it was St. Michael and not a demon.  She essentially will not answer, but she insists that God spoke to her and that He alone can judge her.  The bishops and so forth are for the most part not willing to go along with that.  They believe they will overpower her, that she is \"a mere weak woman,\" but they will be surprised.\r\n\r\nCarl Theodor Dreyer was presented with a more complicated script, and he basically threw it out.  The movie is a strange blend of historical accuracy and historical inaccuracy.  The script is based on the transcripts of her trial, though it is closely trimmed.  She was, after all, interrogated over and over, and this film is less than two hours long.  More interesting, however, is that the name by which we know her is wrong.  I mean, leave aside that she never called herself that.  She called herself Jeanne la Pucelle--\"Joan the Maiden\"--and said at her trial that the tradition in her area was for women to take the name of their mothers, so in theory, she would have been Jeanne Isabelle.  The assumption is that her name was taken from her village, but her village was Domrémy.  (And is now Domrémy-la-Pucelle.)  But her father's name was Darc or some variation thereof.  And her surviving signatures?  She spells her name \"Johanne.\"  At least that's the signature Wikipedia has an image of.\r\n\r\nThe film had an incredible budget for sets, but you barely see them.  The film is done almost exclusively in close-up and medium shot.  There are no establishing shots, not enough perception to see where anyone is in relation to anyone else.  Apparently, the costumes are period-accurate, but you barely see them.  Most of the film seems to be made of close-ups of Falconetti, whose powerful, expressive face is what sells the picture most.  You see Jeanne's pain and ecstasy, her anguish at being refused the chance to take Communion, the tears she sheds because she cannot do anything else but weep.  If it is true that there is no makeup in this, I'm even more impressed with her face.  (Obviously, the film does not use the heavy makeup of other silent films, but isn't she wearing lipstick?)  And of course, makeup cannot create the pure expressive nature of what she sells to the audience.  All it would ever do is cover it up.  If Jeanne seems fake, everything else would as well.\r\n\r\nI do not know how much of this I get from Roger.  There are three other great influences on my interaction with film, and some of what I notice might come from another.  (Not Mom, Gods love her, who just got me into film but didn't teach me much about it as a medium.)  It's theoretically possible that Raul or Mr. Garden might have taught me some of this, but if they had, I do not remember the moment.  I remember Mr. Garden's passion for B&W, and I'm pretty sure Raul preferred letterbox, but how I view film has been so shaped by Roger over the last ten years or so that I cannot know remember what was shaped before then.  (I also remember Roger lecturing about B&W and letterbox, of course.)  But you know, I went and read Roger's Great Movies essay--which of course I recommend!--and realized that he and I had seen many of the same things.  Yes, I'd read the essay before, but I'm not sure when, and I didn't read it in preparation.  After all, when I turned the movie on, I thought Roger would be there when I turned it off.",

So yes I applaud this film in its accomplishments, but I don't think I will ever watch this again. For one thing I never found the tale of Joan of Arc at all interesting. It's probably because my lack of any spiritual life, so while this might be a personal problem, but then again I am giving this a personal rating. If I would still award art house ratings this would be around a 4 star . But with with disinterest of historical hero Joan of Arc, a movie about her trial also served me little.

The Passion of Joan of Arc does not only represent a height in cinematic history that has hardly ever been reached again, but also stands as a masterpiece of avant garde beauty and intensity that not was not only ahead of its own time but has quite possibly never been replicated since. The camera movements and challenging angles are vibrant in experimentation. Furthermore, the long close ups of Maria Falconetti, whose face conceals all the pain and emotion that was needed to fill the boots of such a difficult personage in such a controversial event in religious history, portray a performance that is one of the strongest of the silent era and also perhaps the first example of pure cinematic method acting.",

            "content": "Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is the story about one of the most legendary warriors in western history. A woman that has been the subject for a countless of screen adaptions. Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc) was just a normal peasant girl, whom according to herself was chosen by god to lead the French to victory against the British. But after she failed to defend Paris, she was handed over by her own to the British, who of course burned her at the stake, because of her heresy. She was just nineteen.\n\nDreyer's film evolves around Joan's trial in England, where all the priest and judges tries to convince her that she was send by the devil, and that she is lying. While Joan on the other hand is truly convinced that she is the messenger of god, and that she acted only according to gods words. After getting tortured, she then sign a document that she acted by the devil, but then change her mind and choose to die a martyr death for her belief.\n\nThe Passion of Joan of Arc was not a great success when it was released in 1928. It was such a big flop that Dreyer couldn't make a movie for ad least ten years, with the exception of \"The Vampire\". It was believed lost, until 1981 when an original copy was found in a mental institution in Norway. And has from then been counted as one of the greatest films ever made. \n\nWhat makes this film so great, is the use of close ups, which are perfect, because they capture every emotions and horror in everyone's faces, every bodies facial expression, meaning that this is a film unfit for Nicholas Cage. The walls are white. The focus is entirely on the peoples faces. And Maria Falconetti who's never acted before, does a marvelous performance as Joan, she pulls it off like a professional. Even though I think it's a little to much crying, it's still a stand out classic. Thumbs up.",

Dreyer fabricó un cuadro impresionante para el destello mate y rotundo de una Renée Jeanne Falconetti sobrecogedora. Su interpretación expresionista y esos primerísimos planos que son pura pornografía psicológica han pasado a la historia del cine como cumbres insuperables. Son dos de los detalles que más impresionan de una película emocional, de rostros y de almas, de una belleza pura y deslumbrante.\n\nLa vida del film corre paralela a la historia que cuenta. No fue bien recibido en ciertos sectores (como era de esperar) y fue destruído por el fuego. Por suerte, una copia de buena calidad encontrada en los años 80 hace que podamos acercarnos si no a lo que fue la película, sí a una aproximación poderosa e impactante. Es una suerte que la maestría del rodaje del genial cineasta danés no se haya perdido para siempre. Así podremos gozar una y otra vez de esas lágrimas lacerantes y esa faz expresiva y torturada que es el auténtico reflejo de una Virgen Dolorosa. El sello eterno de una película que no se tira por el lado del nacionalismo (apenas es esbozado) sino por el de la lucha contra la sinrazón, las imposiciones y el fanatismo. Sí, una fe inquebrantable en unas creencias que pueden hacer arder a cualquiera. A cualquiera con un alma propia y una voluntad de acero.\n\nPero tampoco esta dureza puede explicar la fascinación pictórica de una obra que emana dolor como pocas. Dolor auténtico y frágil, un poema visual inconmesurable con el dolor más punzante que imaginarse pueda, la aceptación de la certeza de enfrentarse a un destino injusto e inexorable. Estas son las claves sobre las que avanza la película. Con la lentitud de una procesión que no por solemne es menos impía.",
