    "summary": "Wrongfully accused of criminal acts, a tramp (Charlie Chaplin) unwittingly ducks into a big top, where his bumbling attempts to avoid pursuing police officers earn the laughter and applause of the circus-goers. Impressed, the ringmaster (Allan Garcia) decides to employ the tramp as an entertainer. In between getting trapped in a lion's cage and partaking in clumsy high wire escapades, he falls for a beautiful show rider (Merna Kennedy), who unfortunately has eyes for a daring tightrope acrobat.",

            "content": "Little Tramp is back at it again when he joins The Circus. Charlie Chaplin's The Circus is quite worthy of laughable fun especially if you're into these silent film comedic artists. The music's score is quite swell. The visuals during the film's climax where the Tramp goes on the tightrope was impressive. The film's humor most of all is hilarious. The Circus was known to be the most difficult experience in Chaplin's career has he dealt with numerous problems both in his professional and personal life. Despite that, Charlie Chaplin still made extraordinary film called The Circus.",

It tells the story of how a ringmaster (Garcia) of an impoverished circus hires Chaplin's tramp character as a clown, but soon discovers that he can only be funny unintentionally. Among other things, it is an amazing self-portrait of Charlie Chaplin the man and his place in the history of cinema.",

            "content": "The man actually slips on a banana peel. \n\nThough a bit slower in its second half than the rapid-fire first act, The Circus is still a rapidly-paced Chaplin comedy firing on all cylinders. With sparing dialogue cards, even among silent films a large proportion of the story is told visually through pure classic comedy featuring the lovable Tramp, at once goofy, kindhearted, slightly devious, and clever. However, for all its hijinks, The Circus ends on a surprisingly dark and introspective note for Chaplin; having spent a considerable part of the runtime being taken advantage of for his comedic talents, he's ultimately left alone in an empty field before dusting himself off and proceeding on his merry way. For one of the earliest American auteur filmmakers who created so much of the stalwart elements of the industry, in the midst of a particularly tragic period in his life as talkies were just taking the stage, it rings surprisingly poignant. \n\nIt's not as immediately profound as some of Chaplin's more drama-tinged films, but has plenty of comedic gold and a few shots that still have iconic status. (4/5)",

Numerous memorable gags abound, including an extensive shoot within a lion's cage, laughably cruel antics involving melancholic clowns, and the iconic sequence which combines vicious monkeys and dangerously amateurish acrobatics on a tightrope. In comparison to Chaplin's other works, it may be noted that sentimental chords are less effectively struck here, but we are nevertheless impressed by a humorous, carnivalesque vision of circus life which would make Fellini proud.",

Both of them are excellent, with masterful displays of comedic timing and scenes that sustain laughter really impressively. There's even less of an intrusion of serious elements here as he doesn't make much of an effort to get the girl, and the best scenes were better than any of the best Gold Rush ones. It's pretty close, but I think Circus edges out as my favorite Chaplin movie, at least so far. Can't wait to see the biopic!",

            "content": "A delight of daring stunts and erratic slapstick from the master!\n\nDirector Charlie Chaplin's comedy The Circus (1928) is a wonderful black and white silent film. Chaplin is essentially paying tribute to his comedy heroes as he demonstrates just how funny circus clowns can be with a variety of silly bits and wild gags. Chaplin's performance as The Tramp is hilarious with his slick physical comedy as he evades the police and circus master, while running into all manner of circus animals. It's quite exhilarating to see Chaplin become this lovable fool with his beloved Tramp character. He's funny and sympathetic as all he wanted was a 10 cent hot dog for pity's sake!\n\nMerna Kennedy is beautiful as the flying ring girl and she's funny alongside Chaplin who's kind to her while her father will not let her eat and throws her around. She's got this sweet romantic chemistry with The Tramp and it's just pleasant watching her trying not to laugh as Chaplin dances, slaps, and falls everywhere. The Circus definitely influenced the Carnival Story about Anne Baxter falling in love with a high jumping act at the carnival. All the clown actors are simply amazing. You can really tell that Chaplin loved clowns and appreciated pantomime and slapstick humor at its finest.\n\nChaplin's direction is fast and creative as he stuffs The Circus full of monkeys, a lion, a tiger, a donkey, and a horse, not to mention all the dazzling clown sequences. The Tramp laughs are the loudest as usual with magic tricks and high wire acts galore. Chaplin even produced The Circus and composed the score! His writing is clever with a brilliantly funny line of dialogue for a horse gag. Chaplin's editing is so quick, you never see the secrets revealed, and most of his tricks are rapid fire one after the other for 72 brisk minutes of fun for anyone to enjoy. Roland Totheroh's cinematography is very lovely with these outstanding wide shots that allow you to see everyone doing jokes on screen all at once with this playful ensemble.\n\nIn short, The Circus is always a fun watch even 100 years after its release!",

I view this film as an autobiographical metaphor.  Chaplin joins the circus and revolutionizes the cheap little knockabout comedy among the clowns becoming an enormous star.  By the end, the circus is packing up and moving on without him.  Chaplin's left alone in an empty circus ring...allegorizing Chaplin's relation to cinema at the exact same time.  The show is moving on without him.  He filmed that ending sequence four days after the release of the Jazz Singer.  When he put a score to The Circus he put that scene with Blue Skies, the song Jolson made famous, only Chaplin played it slowly and sorrowfully like a funeral procession.",

Jesus, what a mean man treating his daughter like that and not letting her eat just because she didn't jump through the hoop. Charlie's so funny and creative with the way he sets up his physical humor. It's real clever. That scene where the kid has a hot-dog and the Tramp eats it from his hand was so good. The way Chaplin runs away form the police is so funny. \n\nI love how the Tramp accidentally incorporates and makes his way into the circus unknowingly and perfectly fits right in. Omg the fucking donkey chasing him lmao! I love how the donkey terrorizes him throughout the whole movie. And the monkeys were amazing! That whole tight rope sequence with the monkeys climbing all over his face was so good. \n\nA simple premise and story but told wonderfully, brilliantly and cleverly by Chaplin. Very charming and extremely fucking hilarious, I was laughing the whole time. This is by far the funniest movie I've seen of Chaplin's. The physical humor is through the roof in this one and it doesn't stop. The movie moves fast which makes for a really exciting and entertaining watch. This movies good commentary on the phrase: out with the old and in with the new. People get tired of the same thing and thirst for something new and fresh, which is what the Tramp brings to the circus. I love how it ends. The tramp decides not to go with the circus and stay behind. This is his way of saying, \"Well it was fun and all but it's on to the next one\". \n\nI can see why so many people love and cherish Chaplin and his movies. The movies he made, were made for the people. I love this movie and I really enjoyed watching it. I'd definitely consider getting it on Criterion.",

I wish I knew why and I don't either. The writer, director, actor and composer Charlie Chaplin has struck gold in this adventure. The germ of the idea was definitely the change in location and spreading still the same humor, humility and belief. And yet, it remains unfiltered for its sweetness. No matter how accurate and magnanimous your vision is on pulling off a dark gritty drama, it would rarely add to the \"I wish..\" list for its \"beware\" and \"wit\" tingling sensation in you. While this sweet love story like this has legs that goes for decades and even centuries for it catches you with big fluffy pillows as you fall down with gullible likeness in mind.\n\nA bread and an egg, the story starts from and it is where it ends. And yes, I get that some might even find this heartbreaking, but Chaplin's genius in the last act of the film, was that he satisfies you with such absorbing themes, that by the end you don't really care how The Circus will finish the show. The product is gift wrapped and delivered to your doors as soon as the last act begins.\n\nThe key is to never go beyond anyone's perspective other than Chaplin's. And this was all drama. The rest of the fill in, are fabulous gags that looks like Chaplin has installed to test himself as an actor, a performer. From enacting like a robotic puppet to multiplying himself on screen to bossing around his opposing co-star like a mentor. Over the years, the only issue I had was with the do over process of the interview of his job, until I realized this time that those mandatory gags were not actually for the laughs, but a showcase of his commitment on the hard work that he inadvertently cares for.",

            "content": "A rather tight, simple premise that blossoms under the influence of Charlie Chaplin's expert touch, like a majority of his timeless classics. This go-around, he happens upon a traveling circus, inadvertently stumbles his way into becoming a star attraction, falls for the trapeze girl and finds trouble with her father, the ringmaster. Sprinkled along the way are frequent doses of brilliant physical comedy, inventive and original as ever, which playfully goof around with the trappings of daily life around the carnival grounds.\n\nChaplin suffered several personal hardships during filming - a messy public divorce, a ruinous studio fire, the death of a parent - and tucked in amidst all the hijinx and gags I found a tinge of quiet sadness and reflection. Particularly late in the picture, when the plucky Tramp falls into the friend zone and struggles with jealousy over his girl's new fling, he emits an air of desperation, then acceptance, that organically develops into a sweet, unexpected climax. It's easy to get the sense that he worked through quite a bit with this picture, both behind the camera and before it, which elevates the product from a very good silent comedy into something more significant, something lasting. The parting shot, in which the show noisily rides off to the next town while Chaplin is left in the dust, serves as a potent metaphor for his fears over the steamrolling arrival of sound cinema (The Jazz Singer opened a mere three months before The Circus) and adds yet another layer to the complex emotional undercurrent. A phenomenal, and oft-overlooked, bit of understated work from one of Hollywood's brightest stars.",

That knowledge always made the load I was carrying seem less significant, and helped me to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. Cinematically speaking, at least in the fine age of silent movies, one of the most difficult gestation periods for the birth of a great film was the highly traumatic 11 months of production for one of Sir Charles Chaplin's masterpieces, 'The Circus'.\n\nI love both silent cinema and early filmic comedies, and though I prefer Buster Keaton to Chaplin, I always enjoy his great works, up to and including 'The Great Dictator'. Particularly close to my heart is 'The Circus'. Considering all of the brutal disasters Sir Charles Chaplin was facing during the movie's elongated production (ruined film negative, studio burning down, Lita Grey's divorce papers [and the related sex-scandals hitting the papers], nervous breakdown, mother dying, IRS demanding a million in back taxes, one of the circus wagons being stolen, just to mention a few), it's miraculous that a film was released at all, let alone one as gracefully hilarious yet contemplatively mature as 'The Circus', and that he was able to both recover and rebound from this bad spell to have a superlative career as one of the greatest actor/directors ever to grace cinema. His life was basically a three-ring circus, and he was still able to retain his dignity and escape virtually unscathed.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned trials and tribulations he endured in those eleven months of the film's making (which IMHO would be worthy of a fine film itself, in its documentation and chronicling), though it may not be as side-splitting in its hilarity as 'The Gold Rush' or 'Modern Times', it will probably hold the closest place to my heart of Chaplin's films.",

Some say it's one of the finest movies he ever made, especially considering the turmoil he went through while making it. There are others, like myself, who just think that it's merely mediocre, or perhaps just slightly above it. The jokes didn't come as fast and as furious as you would expect once the plot kicks in, nor is the heartstring-tugging particularly effective. It's good enough, but not great. It was certainly made with a lot of blood, sweat, and anguish, and personally, I think it affected the final product a bit. Things aren't as spot on as they are in something like The Kid or The Gold Rush. That being said, any Chaplin is worthy Chaplin, even if it isn't firing on all cylinders. This one isn't, but it's not a complete mess of a movie either. It's mildly entertaining at best, and certainly worthy of any fan of Chaplin's.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nI never thought that I would ever find the humour behind a silent picture to be appealing, but Charlie Chaplin has changed all that for me with so far seeing three of his films, and each one managed to put a smile on my face up to their very end. Behind the hilarity, is sadness and pity for a character that is trying to survive in a difficult environment, using comedy only to cushion it.\n\nChaplin's The Tramp is not a perfect individual, featuring flaws driven by his desperation to survive. He does not whine or dwell over his current predicament, he seems to just live every day like it was a new day, only acting through impulse when feelings of hunger and thirst strikes. Opportunities come to the Tramp during multiple points in the film, and with each one he is thankful for it, even if ultimately he wasn't able to attain it. He starts off with minor feelings of selfishness, and why wouldn't he? The world he lives in doesn't do any favours for a guy like him, but when he was approached by a woman, hungrier than he is, he eventually caved and became the bigger man and generously sharing his food with her. It is subtle moments like this that allows characters to grow and to be better understood by the audience watching him; it also gives us a deeper glimpse of the world around him and the people that populate it.\n\nA commonplace in Chaplin's films is a romantic sub-plot, and The Circus handles this quite well, without it overwhelming the tone of the film; ensuring that the drama and the comedy is prioritised. The film ultimately comes to an end that I did not expect, something that is much more melancholy than the previous two films that I have seen from him; The Gold Rush and City Lights. Though I did find the romantic arc in this film to be not as eventful as the two films that I have just mentioned, and a sense of sadness for the character is not as impacting as I hoped it would be. If the film explored a lot more on the father-daughter relationship and how that affects the Tramp then I probably would have been more engaged with it, and found the ending far more saddening.\n\nIn regards to its comedic elements, The Circus is much more self-aware than his other films. The film speaks about the relationship between the Tramp and his ability to create laughter. This laughter not only comes from us, the viewer, but also from the circus audience who also sees what we see; that the Tramp is hilarious because he isn't aware of it. It is when the Tramp has placed himself in a pressuring situation that requires him to impulsively act on it that brings out the best of his comedic abilities; the Tramp is actually an intelligent person when the pressure is on him because he always seems to manage his way through it free from harm, at least for the most part, but he is not completely aware and because of that it comes off as natural and unforced. The highlight would be the moments where a donkey, I presume, chases him relentlessly around; I was constantly asking myself why this is so? But it actually doesn't matter because it just works. As a comedy, The Circus does pretty well but I cannot help but compare it to the other films that Chaplin has done, and The Gold Rush simply had more effective and memorable sequences; with some of those sequences being highly thrilling. The Circus felt like it was a step down in ambition.\n\nThe Circus may not be the most entertaining or moving film that Chaplin has ever created, but it does stand strongly on its own. Very few comedians have the physical gift that Charlie Chaplin has, and The Circus is an example of why that is so.",

The story here has The Tramp unknowingly becoming the hit under the big top, poor Charlie thinking he's only working as a property worker and desperately wanting to impress the daughter of the cruel circus owner. This is classic Chaplin, mixing humor and sentiment in just the right amounts that when you watch it seems effortless. I watched is on TCM and they included something from the 1969 re-issue, where the 80-year-old Chaplin sang the title song. And I just have to say, the bit with the monkeys just kills me every time.",

I really don't see why it is considered a lesser film because it has one of the best love stories and in my opinion the best ending as well. I know City Lights' final scene is one of his best, but I think this one fits his character even better. It is hard for me to pick a favorite film from Chaplin since they all have something unique about them, but it doesn't deserve to be considered a lesser work and more people should check this out. There are several stand out scenes in every one of his features and The Circus is no exception. Some of my favorite include the scene where he locks himself in the lion's cage, the scene where he is walking through the tightrope (a physically demanding scene), the scene where he is in the mirror maze, and the final scene where he walks off to the sunset with his unique and cheerful walk. The Circus is a fun and entertaining film with perfect pacing which never drags. The tramp always reminds us that no matter how difficult our circumstances are, we must never lose our hope and we must remain true to ourselves. One moment he can be stealing food from a baby (but he does it in such a sweet and funny way that we don't judge him), and the next he can be sharing a piece of bread with a lonely girl. He might be unfortunate and clumsy, but he has a heart of gold. The Circus captures the essence of the tramp really well and Chaplin balances pathos with slapstick perfectly once again.\n\nIn The Circus we follow the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) who once again is a victim of his circumstance. After a pickpocket (Steve Murphy) steals a wallet, he hides it in the Tramps pants so he isn't discovered. When a police officer realizes that the tramp is carrying the wallet he chases him across a nearby circus. A few clowns are doing their number, but the audience is bored to death until they see the Tramp running all over the place and stumbling across everything while the police officer chases him. He turns into a sensation without realizing it and the Circus Proprietor (Al Ernest Garcia) hires him. He asks the Tramp to do some funny stunts, but he isn't funny so he decides to put him to work as a janitor. The Proprietor realizes that the audiences love the Tramp when he is actually being his clumsy self stumbling all over the place without trying to be funny so he takes advantage of the situation and uses him. The tramp falls in love with the Proprietor's step-daughter, a Circus rider (Merna Kennedy), who is treated poorly by him. But when she falls in love with the tight rope walker (Harry Crocker), the Tramp loses his magic touch. Perhaps if he can do that act, the girl might fall for him, but it is an extremely risky act.\n\nThe way Chaplin establishes each of his characters through a simple scene and few dialogue boxes is impressive. He also has an amazing talent to make audiences laugh through comedic acts that we've seen before, but adding his unique personal stamp. What's amazing for me is that each lead actress in his films are different, but they all look so much alike. The love story in The Circus is the one that works best for me and seems more believable. The Circus has a lot of heart. Many complained that The Gold Rush lacked a better ending and in The Circus Chaplin managed to deliver one that captured his essence. It may be far less adventurous, but the love story worked much better. City Lights manages to capture the best elements from both those films: a tender love story, some hilarious scenes, and another great ending so that is why it is considered a superior film, but by no means does The Circus deserve to be neglected like it has been by many.",

That knowledge always made the load I was carrying seem less significant, and helped me to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. Cinematically speaking, at least in the fine age of silent movies, one of the most difficult gestation periods for the birth of a great film was the highly traumatic 11 months of production for one of Sir Charles Chaplin's masterpieces, 'The Circus'.\n\nI love both silent cinema and early filmic comedies, and though I prefer Buster Keaton to Chaplin, I always enjoy his great works, up to and including 'The Great Dictator'. Particularly close to my heart is 'The Circus'. Considering all of the brutal disasters Sir Charles Chaplin was facing during the movie's elongated production (ruined film negative, studio burning down, Lita Grey's divorce papers [and the related sex-scandals hitting the papers], nervous breakdown, mother dying, IRS demanding a million in back taxes, one of the circus wagons being stolen, just to mention a few), it's miraculous that a film was released at all, let alone one as gracefully hilarious yet contemplatively mature as 'The Circus', and that he was able to both recover and rebound from this bad spell to have a superlative career as one of the greatest actor/directors ever to grace cinema. His life was basically a three-ring circus, and he was still able to retain his dignity and escape virtually unscathed.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned trials and tribulations he endured in those eleven months of the film's making (which IMHO would be worthy of a fine film itself, in its documentation and chronicling), though it may not be as side-splitting in its hilarity as 'The Gold Rush' or 'Modern Times', it will probably hold the closest place to my heart of Chaplin's films.",

It follows the Little Tramp (Chaplin), of course, as he wanders into the middle of a circus, accidentally becoming the star attraction at one point. He falls in love with the circus owner's daughter, gets trapped in the lion cage, and eventually finds himself walking the tightrope, among other things. The narrative is simple, but it effectively earns your sympathy and concern for the Tramp. A lot of individual scenes stand out as extremely funny, not to mention very technically sophisticated for the time.

Really, there's no way I haven't, though it's true that the library tended to play shorts, given that they were worrying about the bladders and attention spans of seven-year-olds who were likely in it for the air conditioning.  Still, this is shorter than [i]The Hobbit[/i], which I remember vividly being the film one fine Friday.  (Though strangely enough, one version of [i]The Hobbit[/i] is six minutes longer and one is nearly half an hour longer, and I don't know why.)  However, there is a reason this is not among the Chaplin I sometimes go back for.  It isn't as poignant as [i]City Lights[/i] or [i]The Kid[/i], as satirical as [i]Modern Times[/i] or [i]The Great Dictator[/i], or even as purely funny as [i]The Gold Rush[/i].  You can't even really say that it was early Chaplin and dismiss it as such, because it wasn't.\r\n\r\nNaturally, Our Hero never gets a name, though neither does anyone else.  He's just a tramp, wandering about in search of nothing in particular.  In this case, he's dodging the police--presumably vagrancy charges--when he ends up in a circus.  The unscrupulous ringmaster (Al Ernest Garcia) quickly recognizes that the Tramp is not aware of how funny he is, which means he doesn't have to get paid nearly as much as if he knew he was the star.  Meanwhile, the Ringmaster is mistreating his lovely (as in, she looks quite a lot like Maggie Gyllenhaal) daughter (Merna Kennedy), a circus rider.  Whom, naturally, the Tramp loves.  And courts, in his gentle way.  Only the girl meets Rex (Harry Crocker), the Tightrope Walker and only person who gets a character name.  He is handsome, charming, and we never learn anything else about him.  But despite what seems to be the burgeoning love between the girl and the Tramp, she begins to fall for Rex instead, possibly because he can give her a name.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the pair don't quite go together.  The two movies, I mean, not the girl and Rex.  The circus whimsey is funny enough.  I did laugh out loud several times, though there were also several unnecessary title cards which said things we already knew from what was presented in the action.  There's an entertaining sequence wherein the Tramp, while dodging the cops, pretends to be an automaton.  I've been to the circus once, though I only just barely remember it and can't tell you anything about it, including how old it was.  Which means my entire experience with circuses is pretty much based on what I've seen in TV and the movies.  I don't think they've ever been what this movie portrays, though it's obviously equally possible that I'm wrong about that.  For obvious reasons, the movie mostly focuses on the clowns, with a little bit of trick riding and tightrope walking.  And a sequence involving a lion which isn't in the ring anyway.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't gel with the romance.  It's as though Chaplin wasn't sure he had enough story for a feature with either one, so he padded each with the other.  It's also true that the outcome he chose to give us for the various characters isn't satisfying.  He never develops the character of Rex enough to tell us why we should ever think that the girl is better off with him than with the Tramp, should the Tramp stay a successful circus star.  Other than the obvious \"I don't think there's really any such thing.\"  But we're relying on that for Rex, so there's that.  The girl isn't very well developed herself, but the girls in these things are pretty much always just the projection of whatever it is that the Tramp wants in a girl, so I don't expect character development of her.  But Rex is the rival, and if he's going to be deserving of the girl, we need to know it.  Oh, the Tramp isn't much developed in this, either, but he's developed over the course of all the other movies about him, even when they're set in different times and places.\r\n\r\nCharlie Chaplin's great tragedy was that he was never truly able to leave the Tramp behind.  What's interesting, though, is that it might well have been possible if more of the movies were like this.  This is lighter fare than the things we mostly remember him for.  Even [i]The Gold Rush[/i], which is a comedy without much depth to it.  In the end, the problem with this movie is that the Tramp is never really risking anything.  Even when the Ringmaster is screwing him over, the Tramp is arguably better off than he was when he wasn't working for the circus.  He loved the girl, but it doesn't seem to be anything other than a love of the road that drives him in the long run.  He doesn't even seem to be hiding his sorrow when things don't go the way he wants them to.  It's just another event in the life of a Tramp.  I can understand some things, of course, but the thing which marks his better work is genuine pathos when things go wrong for him.  There isn't any pathos here, and the whimsey isn't enough.",

This is my favorite Chaplin film, just because I really could understand what the Tramp is feeling.

But, the result is one of Chaplin's best films, with some brilliant gags and some brilliant visual trickery as well. The Tramp (Chaplin) starts out being mistaken for a pickpocket as the real pickpocket (Steve Murphy) has planted a stolen wallet on him. The Tramp runs from the police, and ends up in the ring of a struggling circus, where the audience believe that it's all part of the act, and when it's discovered that it's The Tramp's buffoonery causing people to laugh when The Tramp doesn't realise it, the Circus Ringmaster (Al Ernest Garcia) keeps him on as a props hand, and makes sure there's potential for buffoonery. The Tramp becomes friends with Merna (Merna Kennedy) the neglected step-daughter of the Circus Ringmaster, who finds solace in The Tramp. But, there's jealousy when Merna falls for tightrope walker Rex (Harry Crocker) and then The Tramp discovers he's the star of the show. It's got some brilliant comedy pieces, all laugh out loud funny and the setting of a circus is perfect for Chaplin's Tramp, and it has some of his most daring stunts, including a literally death defying tightrope walk with some monkeys as well. Hugely underrated but an absolute joy to watch.",

Un borsaiolo, vistosi scoperto dalla sua vittima, si disfa della refurtiva nascondendola nelle tasche di un ignaro Charlot. Questi tenta di discolparsi ma poi è costretto a fuggire dai poliziotti, entrando dapprima nel labirinto degli specchi, poi sostituendosi a degli automi, dei quali imita alla perfezione i movimenti meccanici ed infine irrompendo al centro della pista del circo durante l'esibizione di un improbabile e maldestro illusionista. Con la propria comparsa e la goffaggine del suo comportamento Charlot provoca le fragorose risate del pubblico, piacevolmente sorpreso dall'improvviso sviluppo comico del numero di magia.\n\nLo scarso livello qualitativo degli artisti e la conseguente precaria condizione economica del circo suggeriscono al proprietario di assumere l'artefice del ritrovato entusiasmo degli spettatori, cioè Charlot. Egli viene iniziato ai rudimenti dell'arte del clown ma con risultati assolutamente deludenti e controproducenti che decretano la sua cacciata. L'improvviso sciopero degli inservienti del circo vale il reintegro del vagabondo nell'organico in qualità di attrezzista. In questo modo egli ha l'occasione, involontariamente, di rivelare nuovamente la sua capacità di far ridere il pubblico con il proprio comportamento sconclusionato. Lo scaltro proprietario, accortosi della sua comicità inconsapevole, decide di sfruttare Charlot come buffone per risollevare le sorti del suo circo, ma senza riconoscergli nulla.\n\nCharlot stringe amicizia con la bella figlia del padrone e se ne invaghisce. Sarà la ragazza ad aprirgli gli occhi sulla situazione del suo impiego sottopagato e ad incoraggiarlo a rivendicare dignità e salario. L'arrivo di un nuovo artista, l'equilibrista Rex, e gli sguardi languidi lanciatigli dalla ragazza destano la gelosia del vagabondo che prova ad emulare di nascosto il rivale alla corda sospesa, fin quando non sarà sorpreso dal principale. La disillusione amorosa azzera il potenziale del vagabondo il cui numero non fa più divertire il pubblico, ma arrabbiare il padrone. L'occasione di rivalsa gli si offre quando deve sostituire l'equilibrista, temporaneamente introvabile, nel suo spettacolo alla corda. La sfortuna, l'imperizia e l'accanimento di alcune scimiette dispettose, che quasi provocano la sua caduta, compromettono la riuscita del numero che il vagabondo aveva furbamente preparato con la complicità di un addetto alla corda, il quale avrebbe dovuto sostenerlo in sicurezza durante le evoluzioni acrobatiche. Il venir meno di questo accorgimento e la rovinosa e ingloriosa uscita di scena a cavallo di una bicicletta, che avrebbe dovuto scendere elegantemente al suolo, invece di correre all'impazzata e travolgere il principale, decretano definitivamente il licenziamento del vagabondo.\n\nLa ragazza, continuamente vessata dal padre, fugge dal circo raggiungendo Charlot il quale, consapevole dei sentimenti di lei, predispone un piano affinché Rex la sposi e la sottragga alle angherie paterne.\n\nLa condizione perché i due artisti ora sposi riprendano il loro posto nella compagnia del padre di lei, che non può rinunciare alle loro esibizioni, è la riassunzione del vagabondo che, però, declina l'offerta e in solitudine assiste alla partenza dei carrozzoni circensi. Una volta scomparsi all'orizzonte egli si avvia mestamente, ma dignitosamente, incontro ad una nuova avventura.\n[it.wikipedia.org]",

The Circus is the funniest Chaplin movie that I've ever seen (and I've seen many) and with an ending that could rival City Lights as one of the most incredible endings. A good part of the film is silly zany slapstick hilarity, but towards the end, Charlie manages to draw you into his world of  heart-wrenching romance/drama that is so emotionally gratifying. Charlie was the master of the romantic comedy and he would turn in his grave if he saw what the filmmakers of today have done to the genre. His ability to make you laugh till your sides hurt, and make you want to cry at nearly the same time is masterful. He truly was a cinematic magician.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Circus is a testament to Chaplin's genius. It's a perfect example of how he operates.

            "content": "Great from beginning to end!  Perhaps I will love Chaplin if this is considered one of his lesser films.  His character was so lovable and most importantly, which most silent films seem to lack, everything is full of emotions in every scene rather than focused on just one.  If the jokes are going, he packs in a joke on top of another joke and adds more characters we care about.  Take for example the scene where Chaplin is in the cage with the lion; we fear for his life but his reactions are funny, he knocks a water bin over, and his love interest comes by and sees him in trouble then faints.  Everything is quickly moving in the scene which makes it that much funnier.  I feel like that's what Buster Keaton was missing in The Cameraman: he would be stuck on one emotion and couldn't move on.  I felt so bad for Keaton's character that I couldn't laugh at his problems.  Chaplin on the other hand made himself a sad character, but he can also fend for himself so we can laugh at his problems.  Plus his misfortunes are creating opportunities for himself.  I think this movie must have had the first \"JD moment\"; when the tight rope walker is hitting on the girl Chaplin imagines himself getting up and hitting in him the face then covering him in dirt, but unfortunately they go back to reality and he is still sitting there watching his girl get hit on.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nThe ending was so bittersweet.  I wanted Chaplin and his love interest to end up together!  But alas, he was thrown out of the circus for good and when the girl comes along he realizes he can't take care of her.  He loves her so much that he would rather see what's best for her happen than to actually be with her.  Such a tough pill to swallow.  Chaplin actually goes back to get the tight rope walker to ask her to marry him so that he can take care of her and protect her from her father.  I think the saddest part of it all is when Chaplin tells the tight rope walker and his new wife that he is going to tag along in the last car, but everyone leaves and he watches them go.  Chaplin knew how to tell a great story and keep everyone entertained.  The Circus is a pretty solid flick!",

I will simply ask you to watch this film for yourself. I feel that over analysing The Circus (1928) would only serve to take away the pure enchantment of it. Chaplins reputation as a perfectionist is well deserved and it would be difficult to not feel touched by the ultimate sacrifice of ones happiness for anothers which is so key to the story and beautifully executed.

            "content": "The Circus is often considered a lesser film Charlie Chaplin's filmography mostly being that it was made in between two of his undisputed masterpieces, The Gold Rush and City Lights. Yet, I believe because of this it is an underrated gem as it is filled with brilliant moments of hilarity that rank among Chaplin's best such as when he is stuck in the lion's cage, the donkey chasing him around every time it sees him, his abrupt interruption of the circus act going on while being chased by the police, the room full of mirrors where he is being chased by a man who had earlier picked a man's pocket and then chased again by the same cop he interrupts the circus act with. All these moments are extraordinarily funny but the best moment in the film is towards the end where he takes over the act of a tightrope walker who is in love with the girl that Charlie is also in love with. He takes this opportunity to show off his skills. He has one of the property men connect a rope to him so that when he is on the tight-rope we won't fall and so he can things that are impossible to do without a rope holding you up. Eventually the rope holding him gets unconnected and leaves Charlie on the rope trying to keep balance. Add in a few monkeys, literally climbing on to his back, and you have one of the best moments Charlie Chaplin ever created. Yet, there is one thing that brings the movie down, and that is the ending. He eventually lets the tightrope walker settle with the girl and get married. It isn't really explained why he let her go with him even though she wanted to go with Charlie. It doesn't make sense. But the movie nevertheless comes highly recommended because everything else that has happened prior to that was an absolute treat. And in typical Chaplin fashion, the film ends with the Little Tramp walking off to whatever lies ahead for him with the iris of the camera closing the shot. It is probably one of his least sentimental films, but ranks right along with The Gold Rush and Modern Times as the funniest film he ever made. Highly recommended viewing. 9/10",

This is the first Charlie Chaplin film I've ever seen, and I'll have to say now that I was absolutely delighted by what I saw!\r\n\r\nThis film is a slapstick comedy about The Tramp (Mr. Chaplin), and he finds himself on the scene of a travelling circus that is struggling to entertain people with its lame performances. After a run in with a pick pocket and the police, the Tramp accidentally entertains everybody. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say the ring master hires him, and he has the audience in stitches with his clumsiness. He also falls in love with the ring master's daughter (who is hot!).\r\n\r\nWe follow the tramp as everything unlikely that can happen to him does happen to him, like monkeys escaping, him getting chased by a disgruntled old mule and him getting locked in the lion cage.\r\n\r\nThis was a heart warming comedy with an intelligent, artistic side that would make this review too long if I were to break it down, but in the long run it was about the difficulties of comedy and the hilariousness of spontaneity. \r\n\r\nIt was an excellent break from the sex, violence, drugs, vulgarities and depressingness of the films I'm used to. And it also made me laugh (unlike a lot of old comedies /cough *Cary Grant*).\r\n\r\nI give this 5 stars. Definitely recommended and I dunno why this is seen as a lesser work of Chaplin.

Unfortunately, I found the film significantly less funny once the police business was over. The rest of the film was amusing, but didn't live up to the beginning. Still, it's a pretty good film.\n\nChaplin is of course the most important actor in this film. He plays his tramp character quite well and delivers quite a few memorable scenes. These scenes aren't quite as memorable as those in some of his other films, but they're still good.\n\nOverall, this isn't Chaplin's best work, but it's a good film nonetheless. It is surely a must-see for Charlie Chaplin fans.\n\n77/100\nC+\n\nUP NEXT: To be determined",

This was a decade where the great Buster Keaton proved that putting one's life on the line could lead to some of the heartiest laughs, and Chaplin seems to take a cur from his success; he takes his Tramp act to the tightropes and inside the lions cage for a series of dangerous routines which are both funny and daring.",
