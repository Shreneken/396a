Especially when time travel isn't involved, but this works.  But my biggest problem is with the length.  There was no need this movie had to be 2\u00bd hours.  After the success of \"Reservoir Dogs\". Quentin Tarantino got full of himself and making these massive movies in length and like \"The Hateful Eight\".  There is at least 20 to 40 minutes that could have been trimmed.  Like 40 minutes of the main characters dicking around in a pub.  It is the masterpiece critics say it is?  Not quite, because of the pacing.  When they're not dragging their feet through knee high wet cement, it's fun.  The villain the twist Col. Hans Landa is charming and terrifying.  Overall a good movie.  Not as perfect as some say, but it is worth a watch.",

Christoph Waltz's Oscar winning performance is certainly the hardest hitting role in the film, but don't count Brad Pitt out either. Both work together to form a compelling story around their noteworthy acting ability that revolves around killing Hitler during WWII. Add Diane Kruger's turn as a Jewish woman who seeks revenge against the Nazis for killing her family during her adolescence and you have an absorbing, but deceptively simple, premise that is wildly engaging throughout. Tarantino is a cinematic wizard who proves that he still has plenty left to give, even after all these years.",

            "content": "It's movies like these that make Tarantino one of my all time favorite directors, along with Kubrick, Miyazaki, Scorsese etc. Inglourious Basterds is not only one of the best war films i've seen, but probably one of the funniest ones as well. I loved the ficitional World War 2 setting, which drew from the real events yet went completely over the top with some creative liberties. Tarantino has an uncanny ability to create unnaturally good and engaging dialogue, and combining that with the amazing pacing, you are left with some carzy, action and tension packed 153 minutes of pure goodness. Every single actor and actress in this one does a fantastic job, from Brad Pitt to Diane Kruger to the smaller roles, but my personal all-time favorite has to be Christoph Waltz's menacing, calculating, low-key, ruthless portrayal of Hans Landa. Undoubtedly, one of the scariest, most brilliant performances I've seen on film. And all it takes to realize the subtlety and brillaince of his performance is the opening scene at the French countryside. The small movements on his face, the fluctuations in his voice and mannerisms etc. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the editing and sound design only help the film. There is so much violence (in a typical Tarantino fashion) in this one that it becomes mindless fun up until the very end. Obviously, the final act of this film is a masterpiece, and some of my favorite scenes from the film (which live rent free in my head) come from this one (the Italian scene in the cinema venue). Plus, if you ever wanted to see a couple hundred of Nazis get absolutely decimated in a movie theater covered in flames and ready to blow up, this movie is for you. I strongly reccomend this one, if you can stomach the gratuitous violence, it is an absolute blast and a joy for cinephiles.",

The opening of Inglourious Basterds will forever be one of the best openings to any film ever, the way Tarentino builds tension is masterful. Outside of all the blood and gorr, the film delivers some fantastic comedy movies, with my favorite being, when Brad Pitt starts to talk Italian with the most American accent ever. Christopher Waltz delivers one of the most iconic supporting actor roles ever, with Brad Pitt and the rest of the cast also delivering great roles.

            "content": "I adore Quentin Tarantino, he's a filmmaker like no other, the way is he able to create almost entirely dialogue driven films that have no down time or boredom is what makes him one of the best directors of all time and Inglorious Basterds is my favourite film of his and one of my favourites of all time. The plot of this movie is simple: 8 Jewish soldiers set out to kill every Nazi in sight. It's simple and it's impossible not to get behind the deaths of some of histories evil human beings. But there's just one Problem, Christoph Waltz is the way of them killing he entire Mazi command and Waltz gives an absolutely Incredible performance which ranks up in the greatest performances of all time. Theirs not a single scene where he's not intriguing or down right terrifying. Brad Pitt also gives one of his greatest performances here not only is he really funny and an entertaining character buts he also really unpredictable and really cruel which just make him an overall better character. This movie contain some of the best building tension ever put to screen for example the scene in the bar that just has you on the edge of your seat and still manages to leave you startled when everyone starts shooting and again it's all through dialogue. This is not a war movie it's a Tarantino movie it's not trying to be a historical movie it's trying to be a tension filled Masterpiece and the proof of this comes from the films ending. Not only is the movie within the movie incredibly well executed but the events surrounding the final assassination of Hitler and the high command all comes together perfectly it's feels earned and I really admired Tarantinos choice to change history. It's give the film as a whole a more satisfying conclusion. If your looking for a war movie this is not for you but if your looking for a movie with incredible performances and tension filled sequences then this is for you and is in my opinion Tarantinos greatest achievement.",

Melanie Laurent also played her role to perfection. Though being an ensemble piece, the show stealer for me is Christoph Waltz. Man, he had such a great screen presence and I couldn't picture anyone else playing that role! There were no weak links whatsoever. This movie is conversation-driven for the majority of its duration, but was thoroughly engaging and well-written. Cinematography, sound design and VFX were top notch. Another major plus point is the costuming and make-up, though minimalistic and nothing extravagant, but must have been thoroughly difficult to nail it, as simple make-up and costuming often proves to be the most difficult to get it right. The set designs also gave the feel of the 1940's era. A must-watch for all the people who love intense character-driven stories along with occasional gore and bloodshed. A solid 5/5 from my side!",

Directors: Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth (uncredited). What a great flick. Quentin Tarantino returns with the story of the Basterds, a group of Jewish soldiers performing guerilla warfare and terror tactics behind enemy lines to strike fear into the hearts of German soldiers during World War II. Inglorious Basterds is a very difficult film to pigeonhole. It's part Jewish revenge fantasy, part gung ho war film, part knowing parody of patriotic flag wavers and 100% Tarantino. Tarantino has found his new muse in Melanie Laurent. She was fabulous. The performance of Christoph Waltz, playing the Nazi Gestapo figure Col. Hans Landa, is the highlight of the film. His ability to convey courtliness and sympathy and then go to commit the cruelest of horrors is simply superb. Inglorious Basterds is naughty, apocalyptic fun -- Tarantino's version of a war movie, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinema. Like a bat to the head, it's not too subtle, but you can't help but watch.",

The way the tension is build up throughout that opening scene is truly magnificent, and the camera pans down just at the right time. And by that time you've already learned to absolutely despise Landa, probably the most disgusting character Tarantino ever came up with. He's truly a man you love to hate, and his charming persona just makes him seem even more evil. He's if possible even more threatening than Jules Winfield was in the infamous breakfast scene from \u2018Pulp Fiction.\u2019 The segments with the basterds are probably the ones Tarantino had the most fun with, and these segments really know no boundaries in any way. Not only are they hilariously violent (the baseball bat!), they also ignore every possible historic fact. I wouldn't really want it any other way really. Another highlight is the bar scene, which illustrates perfectly how unpredictable this movie is. There are too many good moments to be naming them all, but this movie benefits so much from its outrageousness you really need to see everything for yourself.",

With this bizarre and bold new film, he has delivered a World War II film unlike any we've ever seen before. It's a deliberate, history-altering picture. Long, tense scenes play like subtle Nazi interrogations. These scenes may seem to wander on but the suspense they generate, the jolting payoffs are satisfying in the extreme. Brad Pitt is a drawling hoot and gets the chance to chew up some scenery as the leader of the \"bastards.\" There is solid support from the likes of Diane Kruger, Melanie Laurent (terrific), and even 'Hostel' director Eli Roth. But Christoph Waltz all but walks off with the film in a deliciously evil performance as a well-mannered but devilish Nazi. Tarantino has fun with history and changing the outcome of the war. He directs with his typical sure-handed competence. This may not be his best film, but it is definitely one of 2009's best and most entertaining movie experiences",

Now for why I disliked this film. \nThe story, it was not only hard to follow but INCREDIBLY slow, the brief 30 second intervals of high octane action sprinkled throughout were the only thing that got me through what felt like HOURS of commentary leading up the the epic conclusion. They should have stuck with either the Inglorious Bastards OR Shosanna, instead of dividing the screen time equally between them.

The film begins in 1941 Nazi-occupied France where we are introduced to the character of Colonel Hans Landa also known as \"the Jew hunter\" as he interrogates a farmer regarding the presence of hidden Jews. This scene which is propelled by a slow dialogue ends with the finding and then killing of the hidden family with one member, Shosanna, managing to escape. \n\nAt this time, there is also the group known as the Basterds which consist of eight Jewish-American soldiers that are on a mission to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. The leader of this group, Lt. Aldo Raine ensures the scalping of each Nazi the kill which creates fear among German soldiers. The film itself is divided into five chapters which make use of cinematography to give each its own different feel. The obvious antagonist within the story can be seen as Colonel Hans Landa who encapsulates a cold, menacing character with no regard to the suffering he has caused. \n\nThe film makes use of the common good versus evil archetype to create a story full of brutal violence and revenge. After following the stories of many different characters, the audience is left with a resolution to the story where in the end good defeats evil. The film itself contains the obvious external conflict of the war at the center of the story and makes use of surprising character arcs to create more suspense as the film comes to an end. \n\nLike many other Tarantino films, the audience can expect many dramatic and over-the-top scenes along with the use of comedy regarding serious historical contexts. As we can see from this film, Tarantino also has a tendency to rewrite aspects of history in order to make what he sees best for the context of the film he is creating. By doing so it not only creates an interesting original film, but it can also create some questions regarding Tarantino's authority to do such. The film in its entirety can bring about some form of moral commentary for the audience as far as the ethics of whether or not revenge and violence is acceptable if it is for the greater good. Through his creativity, Tarantino clearly shows the power of cinema within his films which leaves me to give this particular one a 4-star rating.",

            "content": "Inglorious bastards is an ingenious movie presenting the dichotomy between Nazi and Allied power perspective through the usage of incredible cinematography. However, the film over extenuates historical facts regarding WW2, which frequently clouds the social commentary the film intends to convey. Three crucial elements give the film a 3.5/5.\n\nThis movie employs excellent cinematography. Specifically, in the scenes in which Nazi officer or Jewish Hunter, Hans Landa, interrogates the Americans, the cinematographers center the camera around not the Americans, but Hans Landa. The importance of this element is played throughout the movie; Hans Landa is seen as a manipulative and toddler-like figure, who finds joy in causing the pain in those whom he hunts. This is especially evident at the beginning of the film, where he realizes that the Jewish refugees hiding under the home are not able to speak English, so he proceeds to speak in French to hide is future intentions. Because he intentionally does this for the sake of killing the Jewish Refugees, he begins his character already as a manipulative individual. With the implementation of cinematography as the one listed above, the movie further portrays the extent to which Hans Landa is manipulative.\n\nEven though the film employs excellent cinematography, the film falters on its social commentary through a historical lens. The film clearly makes it evident that, despite whatever light this group is in, the Nazis are the antagonists: the scene where Hans Landa manipulatively kills the Jewish family and leaves Shosanna alive, the bar scene, and the refusal of the Nazis to have a black projectionist, which all support the western lens of Nazism being awful. However, portraying the historical facts inaccurately, such as the mass shooting of a theater with Hitler caused by the Americans, portrays the Americans in a light that deviates from the existing social commentary that the film tries presenting itself in. For instance, after the film tape switches to the films that Soshanna and the black film projectionist present, the movie theater catches on fire and burns some of the Nazi viewers. In addition to these casualties, Americans are also seen from the balcony shooting down on the Nazis and killing them as they try to exit a blockaded door. By portraying the Americans as the murders in this case, it directs the antagonistic chracter from the Nazis towards the Americans. Doing so ultimately clouded the film's social commentary of Nazi influence, as now the film is showing both Nazis and Americans as the antagonists.\n\nUnfortunately, the film falters again with the main character developments and arc. Hans Landa, for instance, has an inelaborate character arc based on the way he continously stays manipulative and as the antagonist; he continues his onslaught of murdering and has no change in behavior. Likewise, Soshanna, the Jewish refugee that runs away, also develops in a similar fashion where she becomes a theater owner and decides to murder the Nazis within her film theater. While she does have the option of deciding whether or not she should murder these Nazis, she still goes forward with her decision based on her prior experience (Hans Landa murdering her family). While it is a logical decision for the film directors to pursue, this character arc is expected and does not provide nontraditional elements.\n\nUltimately, factoring in the essential elements in the film, the cinematography uplifts the movie in an excellent manner; however, the movie is hindered by its poor character arc and unrealistic social commentary. As a result of these elements, this movie receives a 3.5/5 rating for Rotten Tomatoes.",

The story of the film is set in the Second World War, which involves a group of soldiers tasked to killing the Nazis and then teaming up with a German actress to conspire to kill the leader of the Third Reich and also being hunted by Nazi officers. As for how the ending will be, I recommend that you go and see for yourself. I guaranteed to be fun and very satisfying. For this film, starring by Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz regarding of the incredible performances of the actors in this movie, it is counted that everyone performed at an excellent level. For Brad Pitt acting in the role of Allies officer that tasked to train soldiers for kill Nazis especially and also find soldiers who are want to join their movement. For Brad Pitt acting, it's cool to play the role of a soldier to kill Nazis with his character. On the other side, Christoph Waltz plays a Nazi officer who chases the Jews and also pursues Brad Pitt's group. The character of Waltz has to play the role of a smart and brutal Nazi officer which suit for Waltz perfectly. By the performances of both two actors and all of the actors that make this film to be perfect and make the audience great access to characters and movies Finally, once you've finished watching it, you'll find it worth to watching Tarantino's best movie ever. You'll get to know the definition of a great movie from the great script and acting which is directed by Tarantino.",

Wildly entertaining and surprisingly suspenseful throughout, much of the tension is derived from, surprisingly enough, the dialogue, where clues are dropped for the audience, giving insight into where things are leading before characters are even aware of their impending dilemma.

But he did spend a lot of money on fake scalps, squibs, blank bullets, flashes, and bangs. (Never let it be said that Tarantino shied away from using 20 bullets when one could have done the job equally well.) And why show us all that scalping in such excruciating detail? Tarantino reminds me of a child killing insects for fun while telling us proudly to watch what he can do - seems a tormented and childish soul to me, especially when combined with the absurd plot. There are some good aspects about the movie - good performances by Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent, and a nicely crafted climax in the theater scene. But the ending too was unintentionally hilarious. For me, the best part was that I did not pay good money to see it in a theater  - I watched it as a rerun on the SyFy channel where it should forever remain.",

With 3 plots in one (following a young Jewish woman who wants to seek revenge against the evil Nazi commander that killed her family, a band of soldiers who kill Nazis, and an actress who is cooperating with the allies in order to feed them information), the movie is expertly written and smartly directed by Quentin. Its one of the few Hollywood films that I know which is almost entirely in another language (only 30% of the film is in english). It shows the authenticity Quentin wanted to put in this fictional war story. The performances are spectacular, in particular, Melanie Laurent, Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Daniel Br\u00fchl, Til Schweiger, and Mike Myers are all great in their respective roles, no matter how much screen time they get. The film is edited so well too, making it feel a lot more modern with its sleek editing style. It's one of the few films that seems to get better and better every time you revisit it, and its one of the few war films that somehow is able to interject comedy without it being out of place. An excellent film and the best in Quentin's long career!",

Tarantino,the undisputed monarch of non linear narratives, goes all guns blazing in his alternate-history depiction of the Nazi brutality and the eventual downfall of Hitler. The film revolves around the bloody and gruesome 'Inglorious Basterds', a group of Jewish Americans vowed to decimate as many Nazi soldiers as possible and act as a harbinger of Jewish liberation. Col. Hans Landa brilliantly portrayed by Christoph Waltz is a narcissistic and callous general in the ranks of the German military in German occupied France region where he's known as the \"jew-hunter\",is the textbook definition of movie villians and perhaps widely regarded as one of the finest villians ever to have graced the silver screen. With an astounding command over French,German, English and Italian, Christoph Waltz shoulders an aura of hostility and unpredictability and brings in a wave of energy to the character of Landa. He truly deserves the Oscar.\n\nIn terms of the writing and characterisation, Tarantino is at his belligerent best with extended scenes of intriguing dialogues, grotesque depictions of violence and an enviable cinematography and music composition. Every second of the narrative gets the audience glued to their screens and appreciate the Tarantino signature style film making. Inglorious Basterds is definitely not for the faint of hearts and those who detest violence in any form.One can't help but notice Tarantino's appetite for violence and storytelling is insatiable.",

They act as caricatures of themselves to provide well-timed comedic release and optimal suspense. As always, the brutality of the film generates shock, but the high-stakes storyline justifies it and is only amplified by it.\n\nThe acting is incredible, and while it and the plot is overdramatized to absurdity, it works perfectly. The line between Light and Darkness is made abundantly clear in the context of Nazis vs. Allies (pretty much a universally accepted depiction of Good vs. Evil). An easy distinction between heroes and villains and a very satisfying resolution allow for an easy, but extremely interesting viewing of the film.",

This war film centers around a group of people who are dedicated to killing, collecting the scalps, and acting violently against any and every Nazi member that they are able to. Tarentino's anti-historical war film shows the capabilities of atrocities when a person is acting under the want or need for revenge and believes that they are on the right side. Unlike other films within this genre Tarentino makes a point to add some comedical elements to his film. Furthermore, he is unapologetically violent in showing all sides and characters of this film. This film shows how violence is justified through causes and beliefs of other people. Something that is deemed inhuman or barbaric is seen as a good thing when it is on the side of the person who is following personal beliefs that are deemed \"on the right side of history\". Additionally, Tarentino makes a point to include violence as it is used for propaganda. All in all, I would give this film three out of five stars. I find that the messages meant to be conveyed through this film are extremely hard to find and comprehend. Furthermore, the sheer brutality within this film and the ahistorical elements within it are extremely off-putting. This film however was effective through its cinematography and subtle acting elements. The lighting that is used in order to show different scenes and characters aids in portraying the characters in a particular way. Furthermore, the coloration of each scene showing the normalization of violence is striking and the sounds of the violence itself are in the background serve to show exactly the atrocities being committed. Unlike a lot of other films within the light vs. dark archetype both sides commit terrible acts of violence and the film shows the reaction to these. However, in this film one side is \"justifiable\" in its actions. All in all, Inglorious Basterds is a film that hits on what makes violence justifiable.",

Considered by many a return to form for Tarantino, and others a misfire of ambition, Inglorious Basterds not only offers Oscar winning performances, but strong genre blending thrills in a rather riotous manner and of course, the subtle monologuing no less expected from a Tarantino feature. What makes Inglorious Basterds click is the utter ambition of the director. This easily tops as the most ambitious project from Tarantino, who juggles more plot-lines than he can handle, amounting to what should end as a colossal mess. And while it may not be the most satisfying ending on a storytelling level, the little pleasures spread throughout the film is what makes this conundrum of a film so exiting. And the ending alone is Tarantino speaking directly to his audience in the best way: proud and confident; bordering egotistical. From the famous opening on the farm, on how Tarantino is able to play us like ooze; stretching us as long as he can; but never unsatisfied and totally immersed, to every scene or Col. Hans Landa, Inglorious Basterds really is undesribale. As such, Tarantino makes films like no one else, from his trademark non-linear storytelling to usage of narration and character introductions, this is more-or-less a film where you won\u2019t say it\u2019s his best contribution to the art form, but rather experimental cinema. Obviously gripes include: Overstuffed, too many characters, too short, weird directing choices, etc. Yet despite blemishes all around, it\u2019s never sour. Each aspect of all the faults are handled extremely well. From the second act of the Basterds Killing Nazi\u2019s to some of the backstories of some of the characters, so randomly then not used again other than Pitt\u2019s character. To the baggy structure of the story, this film truly is unlike anything else. While it does showcase an awesome plot about destroying the Third Reich in a theater, and each plot line weaving it\u2019s way unconditionally into the overall narrative, which is a pleasure of itself, it also manages to poke at the use and acceptance of violence as means for accessible entertainment, or rather propaganda. While it does not hold a candle of say, Malick\u2019s Badlands (1973) on a rhetoric of romanticizing killers and the unconditional nature to killing, nor Refn\u2019s expression of the ultra-violent Drive (2011), Inglorious Basterds gets points on poking some on the issue, but not points on a thoughtful statement. What makes Inglorious Basterds work is the sheer ingenuity of the weaving and the attention to entertainment and the smooth directing. It\u2019s a film that is unforgettable; a messy piece of art that many movies would dare not try to replicate. I like to think at the end of it all, the jumbled plotting is a metaphor for modern moviemaking; a colossal mess.",

Most people say that if they could travel back in time they would kill Hitler and Tarantino made that fantasy a bit more real. His writing and directing skills are unique, impressive, and wildly marvelous. This is a true masterpiece",

Meanwhile a Jewish cinema owner finds herself in a ideal situation to kill a number of the high ranking Nazi officers. \n\nTarantino is one of if not the greatest film makers of all time. Every movie he makes is unbelievably good and unique in some way. \n\nInglorious Basterds has a stacked cast consisting of an amazing Brad Pitt performance, an extremely villainous performance from Christoph Waltz and M\u00e9lanie Laurent does an incredible job as well.\n\nFor me what's makes this film so good is the edge of your seat feeling. Each scene is fairly lengthy, and it allows tension to build, causing you to wonder what exactly is going to happen next. In addition to that Tarantino's timing is incredible the scene can be moving at a very slow and calm pace, and then boom something big happens. It can also be the exact opposite where a scene could be filled with action and music, but Tarantino will all of a sudden slow it way down to allow us to get a grasp on what we just watched.\n\nLike every Tarantino film the dialogue is incredible, every line is well written and extremely well delivered.\n\nThe second act of this film does slow down, but it doesn't take away from the masterpiece this film is.\n\nInglorious Basterds puts Tarantino's talent on display, giving us an incredible movie with a stacked cast.\n\n9.5/10\nA+",

He is outstanding as Landa, it's consistently a joy to watch him act - that early scene with him at the LaPadite household is excellent. Away from Waltz, M\u00e9lanie Laurent is very good in her role as Shosanna.\n\nThe plot and the way it's portrayed is what stands this film up. It has some majestic, tension-filled scenes, great dialogue and the eventual pay-off is fulfilling.

Other than the filming and details, a lot of the characters were fairly shallow, and the only character I could see some depth to was the Jewish woman who had run away from the SS officers. Everyone else, especially the anti-Nazi squad, were very flat and hard to connect to. So, pretty good, but not amazing. It's hard to recommend, though, due to a lot of the unnecessary violence (and I LIKE violence, I absolutely adore war films), so I couldn't say I'd pass it along to someone else.

            "content": "One-Thousand Nazi Scalps- Inglorious Basterds' Success As a Non-Historical WWII Film\n\nInglorious Basterds is a 2009 film brought to us by the direction of the great Quentin Tarantino. The film follows Lieutenant Aldo Raine and his team of \"basterds\" on their quest to kill as many Nazis as they can and take down Hitler. Simultaneously, Shoshanna Dreyfus, a French Jew who escaped during the massacre of her own family, plots to kill the high ranking Nazi officers during a screening of one of their propaganda films inside of her own theater. \n\nOne thing about this film is for certain: it is not a World War II historical film. Rather, I believe Inglorious Basterds is a film about the power of cinema. Despite including real historical figures like Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Goebbels, Tarantino in no way aims to recount factual historical events. Much of the film is centered around film, with the success of Operation Kino. \"Nation's Pride\", the film within a film, shows how violence and killing is glorified in warfare. Similarly, the inclusion of Joseph Goebbels in the film shows how powerful cinema can be in the creation of propaganda.\n\nQuentin Tarantino utilizes allegory many times during this film, alluding to other films throughout the movie. I think this usage of allegory helps propel the message about how film has the power to influence us all.\n\nLess than one-third of this film's entire dialogue is in English. This sets the film apart from most other major Hollywood films. Tarantino's use of multiple languages makes us question what is lost in translation, much like the history of WWII. \n\nTarantino draws upon elements of the \"spaghetti western\" genre in this film. The film utilizes many aspects of this film genre which was most popular during the mid-1960s, including tavern style shoot outs. \n\nThe characters in the film are all presented in a rather hyperbolic fashion. The leader of the basterds, Lieutenant Aldo Raine, played by Brad Pitt, has a deep southern accent and screams of American patriotism. Additionally, his band of basterds are mostly Jewish-Americans. \"The Bear Jew\", played by Eli Roth, infamously kills Nazis by beating them with a baseball bat. \n\nTarantino is able to present a sensitive subject matter while incorporating some humor and still avoids glorification of the Nazi era. Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Light Vs. Darkness. (Spoiler Alert)\n\nThe archetype of light vs. darkness in the film Inglorious Bastards has many connotations, the first is the obvious good vs. evil scenario that pits the Jews vs. the Nazis. Possibly the largest stain on mankind's humanity, the occupation of France by the Nazi Party and the inhumanities that occurred during the 1940s is highlighted well in the movie. Quintin Terrintino plays the director of an alternative history that gives Jews and supporters the power in a fictional plot that killed Hitler and the German High Command. Obviously, Hitler did not die in a movie theatre and at my point of this writing, I am not sure how I feel about this alternative story-telling. On one hand, it allows Quintin Terrintino to re-write ahistorically and display it in such a way that is entertaining but also gives the powerless power. This is one aspect of Light vs. Darkness.\n\nSecondly, the movie is shot in such a way that it displays the Nazis in a dark way, cinematically. This is partially done by happenstance as the German uniforms during World War II were dark (to blend in with the fog that dominates France and other European countries.) Consequently, the High Command of the Nazi Party is killed in a certain way that situates light entering in the darkness. I feel this is done on purpose to highlight the film's archetype. \n\nFinally, we see near the end of the movie that Brad Pitt is dress in a white Tuxedo. This is done purposefully to show the Light vs. Darkness archetype that the film perpetuates. We can argue that the film is progressively going from Darkness to Light as the movie progresses. The light being the Bastards and the cinema owner, and the dark being the evil and the Nazi Party.",

Instead of his usual awesome plot and character development,  he spews a tale unbelievable in it's totality.

            "content": "Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards forces the audience to suspend belief of their preconceived notions of the historical events of WWII. The setting of the movie immediately introduces the viewer to the overarching conflict being told. However, Tarantino splits this main conflict into various storylines and \"chapters\" all converging together to a resolution that is widely satisfying to a western eye. \n\tThe brutal violence enacted on the Nazi's by Lt. Aldo Raine's Bastards and Shosanna throughout the movie is largely justified in our minds due to the understood evil nature of Nazi's. Despite this, it is often hard to distinguish any of the characters from representing evil in various forms of violence and malicious motives. Tarantino puts emphasis on Jewish vengeance and revenge in this film, straying away from the outside narrative of Jews as the victim of the story. The violence enacted by Jews in this film is almost unnerving to some Jewish people, who see themselves largely as stepping away from such violent culture of revenge and being the \"bigger\" person in such a situation. However, this movie revolves much more than just around violence and action. \n\tThe enjoyment of this movie doesn't come from the violence or resolution, but largely from the creative dialogue and cinematography building underlying tension from scene to scene. The opening scene of the farmer giving up the Jews, and the scene in the basement display this tremendously. Tarantino's close up shots of milk pouring, the stirring of milk, and their accompanying sounds oddly create the feeling of unease in the farmer along with the viewer. This is accompanied by Hans Landa's dialogue, and the ability to talk as if sympathetic, while also being teasingly deadly, turning the screw tighter and tighter. A single 25 minute scene of dialogue might seem unbearable in most situations, but Tarantino is able to weave clever dialogue and allusions made for an incredible scene in the basement meeting with actress Bridget Von Hammersmark. The consistency of the guessing game being played, drunkenness of a new father, and introduction of an unexpected character, continued to pile on the tension throughout the long scene. \n\tThis tension, dialogue, and violent revenge is complemented with quite a few comedic elements. From Aldo Raine's hillbilly nature, the bastards antics, Landa's giddish behavior, and the Bastards ridiculous attempts at Italian accents. While these elements combine to create a very enjoyable movie, the audience really sees no arc in any of the characters introduced. Every main character maintains the same mindset and end goal. Although Landa does change sides at the end, he has a seemingly underlying motive of simply being notable and doing what is best for himself.\n\tMany criticisms of the movie come in the eyes of those who believe Tarantino is plundering history and being exuberantly inaccurate, creating a fantasy land of improbable scenarios. However, Tarantino sees this simply as a \"what if\" scenario. If these characters had existed in these roles, in may not be that unlikely that events could have resembled a similar outcome. In fact, most movies suspend belief, twist history and reality to create enjoyable, impactful films. Tarantino does this incredibly well, with exceptional dialogue, converging storylines, and great acting, especially from Christopher Waltz.",

            "content": "This is a transcript of my movie review you can watch on YouTube by just typing in \"Beanlight Reviews.\"\n\nThis review will contain spoilers, but I think if you watched this video before watching the movie, it wouldn't spoil the impact of the film itself. So there's your warning, take it or leave it. \n\nInglourious Basterds is the sixth film by Quentin Tarantino, and it's the beginning of a couple of new phases for the renowned director. The first phase is that it features the first star character who is a protagonist that defends others. In Kill Bill and Jackie Brown, both of those women protagonists were in it for self defense, but in Inglorious Basterds, we find Brad Pitt and his crew of Nazi-killing basterds really in it for selfless reasons. \n\nI mean, how much more selfless can you get but to roam Nazi-occupied France for no other reason but to scalp you some Na-tzies? \n\nAnother phase this kicks off is the reimagining or rewriting of history. Where Quentin Tarantino piles his characters into a period of history and they completely alter life as we know it turned out. \n\nThis movie has one of my favorite opening scenes of all time. Coming into this film, we already know the stakes, we know who's good and who's bad, and these two actors work really well together to build some palm-wetting tension, even before we're shown the Jews hiding underneath the floorboards. \n\nI fell in love with the acting talent of Christoph Waltz in this movie. I had never seen him before, but even as a Nazi, or the feared Jew Hunter, he had such a charisma and charm about him, that you can't help but simultaneously despise him, but cannot get enough of him. He has so many funny lines, that even after multiple times of seeing this movie, still crack me up, but then he can turn menacing and murderous on a dime. Like, the fire is really pretty until you get too close. \n\nBrad Pitt, as the leader of the bastards, also brings a unique charm and humor to this movie that I wouldn't expect from him. He's almost slapstick with his line delivery, and I think he's a good match for Waltz. And almost every other character is low-key enough that they help move the story along at a very good pace. \n\nI can't lie. I'm obsessed with every frame of this movie. I think it's very close to being as good as a movie can get. And let's face it, how much happier can we get watching Nazis get burnt to a crisp and Hitler's ugly face get ripped open by a hail of bullets, eh? \n\nYeah, I think I like Tarantino's version of history so much better. \n\nSo where do I rank this with the other Tarantino films I've reviewed? This goes straight to the top of the list as my number one favorite, just above Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Of all the movies on this list, this is the one I delight the most in returning to time and time again. What is your favorite Tarantino film based off of this list? And tell me what part of history you'd like to see rewritten. Let me know in the comments below.\n",

Christoph Waltz delivered a perfect performance and need I remind you he speaks 4 languages perfectly. The actresses are talented and beautiful. Melanie Laurent is completely convincing as the vengeful Jewish cinema owner. Diane Kruger is also perfect as the German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark. The only shame in the movie being a lot of the classic dialogues are in foreign language. Around 60% of the movie is either in French and German. Which, for me is totally fine \u2018cause it would be weird to have the characters speaking accented English. However, making them speak a foreign language makes the impact of the dialogues weaker and makes them hard to quote. Well, still it\u2019s not a big deal but hey for me this is still a brilliant movie. 10/10",

I'd like to consider this as the writer and director Quentin Tarantino's intermediate state of his creative professional life. This is where his career was in transition period and you can practically see him wire his love for cheap thrills into a much more heavy themes expressed majestically on large scales. His cinema grew bigger with diverse subjects, meticulous world and unique old style techniques. Long theatrical takes that tests both the actor's talent and sparks up the love for old theatre plays among the audience, his conversation aren't funny for the laughs anymore.\n\nThis is where I feel he has matured the most as a writer. What was intended to be a distraction is part of a job, now. It is a responsibility. And Tarantino being aware of his influence as a filmmaker and of his work, he loads the guns with poetry and punches with self-explanatory metaphors. The blood flooded on the screen isn't a luxury but a necessary scream that yells out the love. A small kid loving the cinema for what it is.\n\nThat innocence is what drew me in, in this latter stage of Tarantino's work, something that I didn't feel in his previous work. His rich characters that he always shines in his film like an emblem is carrying enormous depth and history. And carrying most of that load is Brad Pitt flexing his comedic skills along with Christoph Waltz whose mixture of fear and power conjures you on the screen like no one in the film. But I lean towards Melanie Laurent's character every time she appears on screen. And I have been wondering for a while, why is it that now. For among these Inglourious Basterds that are pragmatic and resemble a lot to the people we live around, hers is cinematically empathetic and offers a hand for us to hold onto in this cold war.",

A few days before, I watched Reservoir Dogs with my brother, introducing me to Tarantino movies, and I was ecstatic that my Dad agreed to take me to Inglourious Basterds since the trailers made it look like a good revenge film. I was surprised that the film went beyond this notion and was simply fantastic overall, leaving me smiling as I left the theater.\n\nLet me just say, the early trailers for this film are deceiving. They make it appear that the premise is simply Brad Pitt and his men killing Nazis in a brutal manner throughout. This is definitely not the case, and actually touches on subjects I never would have imagined. Tarantino shows his knowledge for German cinema throughout as the main character of the B plot - Shoshanna - comes to own a cinema, and the Nazis are dealing with where they should hold the premiere for the new film by Joseph Goebbels - Nation's Pride.\n\nThe villain, played by Christoph Waltz, is such an amazing character to watch. At certain points, he exhibits intellect and detective skills near Sherlock Holmes levels, and at other times he makes us laugh with how out of touch he is with certain customs. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost fully dedicated to this Hans Landa, and it proves to be among the best sequences Tarantino has ever written.\n\nI fully believe this film had a better screenplay than Django Unchained, but to me, it makes sense that the academy went with The Hurt Locker for best original screenplay. It makes sense not because The Hurt Locker fully deserved it, but because The Hurt Locker was a film that this country needed in 2009 to shape our perspective on the war being fought over seas.\n\nWhile Inglourious Basterds is not an accurate depiction of World War II or one of the most important World War II films, it is certainly one of the most fun to watch. It is tense, funny, crowd-pleasing, and at the same time it is a very smart movie with well-developed characters, an intricate plot, meta characteristics, and above all, extremely well-written. This now holds the spot of my 2nd favorite film by Quentin Tarantino, behind Pulp Fiction.\n\n10/10\n\nThis review was written in 2015.",

German soldiers are depicted as being honorable and patriotic, but are ultimately the enemy that needs to be destroyed. Hans Landa is a trademark Nazi, both brutal and sophisticated, making him both likable in some strained fashion, easy to hate, and serves as both the linchpin of the story and the antagonist the moviegoer wants to see brought down.\nIB is driven by good characters and a story that's not terribly nuanced or interesting, but ultimately fun nonetheless.",

            "content": "I've never been a Quentin Tarantino acolyte, I don't think Pulp Fiction (1994) is as brilliant as some people do, but I can appreciate why films like this are enjoyed by so many. Waltz's performance is a delight and the writing and direction is ingenious in many moments, managing to capture a humor and a tone that feels shockingly modern. He is more reined in here than in Death Proof (2007) and that allowed me to enjoy the film more because the screenplay did not seem so self obsessed and pretentious in it's execution. The sight of so much talent on screen is of course exciting but they are all put to good use and the visual style of the film was enrapturing. This is definitely a film worth seeing, it is a very pleasing 2 hours and 33 minutes that is gory, violent and funny in equal measure.\n\nShosanna Dreyfus, Melanie Laurent, manages to escape execution during World War II but she is spotted by SS Colonel Hans Landa, Christoph Waltz, as she runs away from him. A group of Jewish-American soldiers known as the \"Basterds\" are lead by Lieutenant Aldo Raine, Brad Pitt, exist to execute German soldiers and carve swastikas into their foreheads to prevent them from assuming new identities. An adult Shosanna, now known as Emanuelle Mimieux, catches the eye of a lauded German soldier Frederick Zoller, Daniel Bruhl, who organizes a screening of a propaganda film about himself at the cinema she owns. A German film actress and double agent Bridget von Hammersmark, Diane Kruger, and a British lieutenant, Archie Hicox, Michael Fassbender, make attempts to infiltrate Nazi circles while a conspiracy is organized by Shosanna and her black boyfriend Marcel, Jacky Ido, to murder all of the Nazis present at the screening.\n\nThe best part of the film is the dialogue as several humorous and witty exchanges occur that are always punctuated by violence. Landa's interrogation of von Hammersmark in particular was hilarious as her excuses becoming increasingly desperate and the sight of his finger plunging into her leg makes you feel queasy. Nice touches like the fact that German's signal three with their thumbs and not three of their fingers are dropped in and Tarantino seems to have made an effort to explore German culture. All of Landa's monologues are delivered brilliantly by Waltz but what is on the page is already an exploration of the evils of Nazism and the smarts of opportunists. I did find the whole exercise to be a bit self important at times, more on that later, but it's undeniable that the great moments in the film are crowd pleasing.\n\nThe visuals are rich as Robert Richardson shoots the film like a 1940s noir film and makes the beautiful blondes appear like Veronica Lake and Carole Landis. I appreciated the drama of the climactic scene as blood flows from the heads of Nazis and drenches the carpet below them and a projection of Laurent's face goes up in flames. \n\nThe one thing that I did not like about the film was the performance of Brad Pitt. I think that he can be a decent dramatic actor in films like Moneyball (2011) and Babel (2006) but here he just seems lost. I suppose he was trying to go for camp but it didn't feel joyous like seeing Anjelica Huston in The Witches (1990) it just felt out of step with the rest of the film. Waltz and most of the rest of the cast are giving gloriously over the top performances but their seems to be more going on in their performances than just putting on a funny accent and walking like John Wayne. Every time he appeared on screen I was turned off and this performance ruined parts of the film on the whole for me. \n\nI really liked this film despite it being made by people who I generally don't get into. The dialogue, the performance of Waltz and the cinematography really impressed me and drew me in. I would certainly watch this again if given a few months of reprieve because I assume that there is far more going on in the film than I was able to appreciate, who knows maybe I will even like Pitt's performance.",

Inglourious Basterds is a very difficult film to pigeonhole. It's part Jewish revenge fantasy, part gung ho war film, part knowing parody of patriotic flag wavers and 100% Tarantino. Tarantino has found his new muse in Melanie Laurent. She was fabulous . The performance of Christoph Waltz, playing the Nazi Gestapo figure Col. Hans Landa, is the highlight of the film. His ability to convey courtliness and sympathy and then go to commit the cruelest of horrors is simply superb. Inglourious Basterds is naughty, apocalyptic fun -- Tarantino's version of a war movie, with history rewritten to avenge the guilty in ways that satisfy his pop-art cinema. Like a bat to the head, it's not too subtle, but you can't help but watch.\nSummary: The actors are top notch and the carnage is just right.",

            "content": "I truly admire movies that are not afraid to be creative with its gore aspect, and Inglourious Basterds is full of the most interesting methods of violence. Besides that, there are two of the strongest elements in the film that really makes it work. One of them is basically the timing of each scene. The pacing is complimented by the writing in the script. The opening sequence itself is possibly one of the most intense moments done in a simple setting, that being in the home of a family on a warm, sunny day. The genuinely intense looks on the actors makes it to where you can understand how they feel, and the actors themselves get into the film so well that it best shines in the character performance of Christopher Waltz, Colonel Hans Landa. This may be one of the greatest characters director Quentin Tarantino has ever brought to screen. A great antagonist must do two things: make you question his motives, and express a great deal of emotions that some of which would come off you as an uncomfortable man to be around. You can feel the tension from Shosanna Dreyfus, who is played by Melanie Laurent, in the strudel scene. To know that Landa may be planning to murder you soon after the memory of what he did to your family years ago is a thought expressed by the actions that Shossana makes. Once he leaves, she breaks down, and it was something you knew was building up throughout the scene. The writing is very strong in the film, and the fact that Tarantino himself wrote the entirescript is a true accomplishment. With the dialogue in the first chapter of the film, you can feel that different tension felt between both of the characters, along with many interactions throughout the film. There are several instances in the film where a scene builds its tone then immediately alters to a more grim feel simply by the motifs of the characters. Where Stiglitz and the Nazi have their guns aimed at each other's crotch is where the unpredictable struck me. While they did aim fire at each other, I never would have guessed nearly everyone in that room would die in the end. That's an extraordinary scene. Unlike Pulp Fiction and some of Tarantino's other past work, somehow I felt a bit uneasy with some of the gore in the film. I consider that an accomplishment as well, however, as it's truly something so different I can't help but admire it. For people who say that the film's inaccurate when it comes to its history, that's the point. The film is supposed to be set during the second World War and show a couple of different alternatives to how the war could have ended. Brad Pitt's character amazed me, this may be one of his best character performances he's ever done, mostly due to the fact that it's very believable. It almost feels as though the film was written and produced during that time period, but the effects and visuals were done today(or a decade ago as I write this). And, like I said, that's another great accomplishment for a great film.\n\n3.5/4",

He also has his trademarks, like the typical brilliantly written dialogues, intense violence, and at the same time an ironic distance to everything that happens. But it seems to me that these trademarks don't always fit. What works perfectly in \"Kill Bill\" or \"Pulp Fiction\" seems to me to be somewhat inappropriate in the case of \"Inglorious Basterds\". One might wonder how entertaining Nazis and the persecution of Jews should be. I'm not quite sure about that, but somehow that's something that prevents me from liking Inglorious Basterds without restrictions.",

            "content": "I'm trying to watch more Tarantino nowadays because I want to thoroughly understand his filmmaking style and techniques and I would want to have an opinion on all of his movies. A few days ago, I picked up Inglourious Basterds at the library a few days ago, and I watched it last night by myself because I enjoy doing that and I feel like doing activities alone regain my energy. And I thought Inglourious Basterds was freaking awesome. There are so many good things about it. It is not a perfect movie, but there are so many things to love, and I provides this movie with lots of entertainment for the viewers. I think Tarantino's best skill is his interesting writing. A lot like Christopher Nolan's writing, where it is complex, gripping, and has twist and turns, but Tarantino makes these concepts funny and witty, but for this movie, Tarantino also makes the movie subtly suspenseful from his writing. The best thing about this movie is Tarantino's use of subtle suspense, and the entertaining dialogue as always. The suspense is this movie is not really in your face suspense, it's like in the back of your mind suspense. The scene itself isn't really suspenseful, but there are things happening that can give you a suspenseful vibe. A great example of this is the opening scene and the tavern scene. The dialogue is on point as always in every single Tarantino film, and in this movie, it is especially funny. The acting in this movie is also amazing, just like in every Tarantino film. Brad Pitt is awesome in this movie and his accent is so over the top, I love it. Christoph Waltz won an academy award from this movie as his performance as a german detective, and he is great as his role. The majority of this film is actually spoken in languages other than english, and I found that to be pretty accurate because this movie takes place in Europe. The things that come out of this mouth and the emotions that he shows on his face proves that he can act. There are times where he makes you laugh, and there are times where he makes you afraid of his power and might. This movie takes place during World War 2, and this isn't really a straight up war film. This movie is more like a drama that takes place during a war, but there isn't any soldiers shooting other soldiers in this movie. This movie is also very violent and there are scenes in this movie that made me cringe in disgust. During the second act, it did feel a bit boring at times, and there are scenes that didn't really need to drag as long as it should've, but other than that, I thought this film was great. 9/10",

            "content": "Paying Homages, romanticizing cinema, getting into characters, glorifying violence, setting scenes with a captivating dialogue, and displaying delicious food; all the trademarks Tarantino usually boasts are here twice as much as in all his other movies.\n\nConsidering it's not a Western, or a mere Action film, Inglourious Basterds is quite possibly the most entertaining movie Tarantino has ever made so far, and that's due to many reasons. Besides that it has all common tropes and hallmarks you'll find, and throughly enjoy, in his movies, Inglourious Basterds is a very unique entry in the extraordinary director's career. The visual style has never become so remarkably striking in any of other Tarantino's movies.\n\nFrom the opening moments, this movie proves that Tarantino is not just a master of dialogue, but also a master of suspense, but in his very own manner. Of course, the dialogue is the most powerful aspect in this scene, and in another suspenseful scene halfway through, but what Tarantino displays doubles down on the impact of suspense in a way you've never seen before; In the most Tarantino way he never showed before that his fans, like me, know very well!\n\nThe idiosyncratic visual style didn't stop dazzling me with its contribution in suspense, because it simply served at every level. It has a sense of pulp fantasy, and slapstick humor that, oddly, fits with the prevailing tone, maybe because this movie doesn't seem to have a specific tone. And what's more weirder is that the movie never feels inconsistent.\n\nThe performances here are plainly phenomenal. Thanks to the stellar cast that includes, Christoph Waltz whose Oscar-wining performance made Hans Landa one of the best movie villains of this century so far, Brad Pitt who is the only reason I had some hope of victory against Landa's cunning, and M\u00e9lanie Laurent who played Shosanna, one of the most interesting characters I've seen in any film in a while. There are many questions left unanswered about her character, and that's exactly what makes her character so compelling. Michael Fassbender also delivered a brilliant performance as always, most notably in the famous \" German accent\" scene that was the only great thing in a boring, monotonous Chapter Four that made me feel, for the first time in a Tarantino movie, that the dialogue scenes overstayed their welcome.\n\nSpeaking of dialogue scenes, this movie has some of the most iconic lines in amazing dialogue scenes thanks, in large part, to Christoph Waltz scene-stealer appearance. That being said, if there is only one of Tarantino's trademarks that I felt was missing while watching this movie, it would be the riveting, seemingly empty talk in a long scene Tarantino is famous for. Don't get me wrong, I said more than once that this movie has some of the most iconic lines, and some of the most clever dialogues ever put to film, but, as a Tarantino fan, I felt that something is missing in these dialogue scenes, and I found that it's the long talk that explores the character, and delve deeper in his personality and psyche.\n\nAnother issue, and this time I mean a real issue, I've with this movie is its ending, its very ending. While it couldn't be more satisfying to watch, I found defeating Hans Landa by fooling him in such easy way is completely absurd, and totally contradicts with all the antagonist's wits and slyness. For me, that was very hard to swallow.\n\nInglourious Basterds looks pretty good. As a matter of fact, I think it has the best cinematography among all the other Tarantino films. Mostly because of the nifty classic use of shadows and lights that matches perfectly the setting of the movie. Adding to that, Inglourious Basterds also has a killer soundtrack.\n\nInglourious Basterds is a maniac, thrill ride that has one of the best cast ensemble ever put to film. It's a rare case when a director's self-indulgence causes more good than harm. It's a classic Tarantino!\n\n(8.5/10)",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino's bloody fantasy take on World War II.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino's war comedy Inglourious Basterds (2009) is lots of fun for his fans of bloody violence, absurd humor, and visceral action. However, Tarantino's dedication to long-take monologues and sudden encounters with SS officers interrogating people are truly suspenseful drama sequences. They are the heart and soul of how tense Inglourious Basterds feels every scene. The stakes are high for these characters. The opening sequence is already legendary.\n\nIt's like Tarantino took the suspenseful interrogation from Five Graves to Cairo alongside the war mission thrillers The Guns of Navarone, Where Eagles Dare, and The Dirty Dozen. It also reminded me of Valkyrie. Tarantino's direction is gripping and striking with endlessly beautiful shots from cinematographer Robert Richardson. Sally Menke's editing is so smooth and enthralling as she rarely cuts away from reactions, so Richardson's camera can hold on a suspicious face or nervous interrogation victim. Inglourious Basterds is quite something with Tarantino's ambitious direction.\n\nI should say that Inglourious Basterds is entertaining, especially if you just understand that Tarantino is doing a nonsensical revisionist take on World War II with little to no history. Nothing like the operation in this movie really happened, nor is it trying to be realistic, obviously with the Hitler annihilation ending. I like Tarantino's writing with his usual strange humor and memorable characters for a perilous journey into France.\n\nIt is a highly enjoyable, but ridiculously over the top spin of WWII espionage and assassination attempts against Hitler. You get The SS cruelly hunting down the Jewish population within occupied France as well as an American team scalping Nazis within France as retaliation. I think to anyone saying Tarantino was disrespectful to those killed fighting in the war, you have to simply see this as a comedy being ridiculous and Tarantino providing empathy by way of Shosanna's character. Honestly, go into this expecting a neat ride rather than any notions of tasteful violence or historical accuracy.\n\nTarantino cannot help himself. This film contains all of his notable attributes. From his foot fetish shots of Diane Kruger, terribly exaggerated accents, gory scalping violence, bloody machine gun shootouts, and eccentric flair to his characters. Only Tarantino could have written and directed Inglourious Basterds. I appreciate his craftsmanship and original style every time I revisit this film. His writing is entertaining. I do find his signature style really fascinating as he allows his actors to deliver gripping performances.\n\nThe best parts of the film are certainly the acting performances by Christoph Waltz as the heinously delightful Colonel Hans Landa, Brad Pitt as the constantly hilarious Lieutenant Aldo Raine, and M\u00e9lanie Laurent as the devastatingly sad Shosanna Dreyfus. The acting from these three actors carry the movie from start to finish. There are several neat cameos like Rod Taylor as Winston Churchill or L\u00e9a Seydoux as the French farmer's blonde daughter Charlotte, alongside a strong supporting cast. They really do contrast and play off Waltz, Pitt, and Laurent for the most part. Inglourious Basterds is really an acting demonstration for its main cast.\n\nBrad Pitt's thick Southern accent and determined bloodlust is as enthralling as his hilariously bad Italian accent as Lieutenant Aldo Raine. Eli Roth's furious Sergeant Donny Donowitz is a riot with his brutal beatdowns of Nazis with his baseball bat. Roth is quite funny here as an actor before he would go onto becoming one of the worst directors of all time. You revel in his killing Germans. Til Schweiger's angry Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz feels like the entire wrath of the audience at the hateful Germans. You can tell Schweiger liked pretending to kill Nazis. B. J. Novak is funny as the goofy Little Man, Smithson Utivich with his blunt statements. Gedeon Burkhard is excellent at translating as Corporal Wilhelm Wicki with a nice deadpan sense of humor.\n\nDiane Kruger is breathtaking and charming as the elegant German actress Bridget von Hammersmarck. Michael Fassbender's fastidious film critic Lieutenant Archie Hicox is a pleasure to watch try to speak German and blend in as a spy. August Diehl's shrewd and observant SS officer Dieter Hellstrom is frustrating and scary. You can tell when and how he notices mistakes in the spy plot. Diehl is as good as Waltz here.\n\nM\u00e9lanie Laurent is gorgeous as French Jewish cinema owner Shosanna Dreyfus, who seeks vengeance against the vicious Germans who murdered her entire family. I found her extremely empathetic as she's given no agency when in the company of the forceful Germans. You feel all her pain and joy.\n\nI always have a hard time watching Daniel Br\u00fchl's creepy, heinously persistent, would-be rapist Nazi Fredrick Zoller. Laurent feels helpless and afraid with an inner frustration and rage that's fascinating. I felt awful for Laurent's Shosanna never getting a say until her fiery revenge. Tarantino cleverly demonstrates German narcissism and arrogance thinking a French girl in occupied France could ever love them. I liked Jacky Ido as Marcel, whom Shosanna truly loves and plot her cinematic inferno with in Inglourious Basterds. Samuel L. Jackson does great narration for the film like Harvey Keitel's voice cameo as the Office of Strategic Services Commander.\n\nChristoph Waltz is terrifying and funny as German Nazi Standartenf\u00fchrer Hans Landa. His eccentric personality, skilled deduction, eloquent verbosity, polyglot abilities, and shrew manner are fearsome. He deftly goes from French, English, German, or Italian with a shocking fluency. You hang onto his every word and cannot wait for characters to get away from his dangerous villain Landa. There's a reason he won an Oscar for his horrifyingly cruel and cunning antagonist. Denis M\u00e9nochet is heartbreaking as the quiet French farmer Perrier LaPadite in the iconic opening sequence. Sylvester Groth's narcissist Joseph Goebbels is grotesque like Martin Wuttke's raving dictator Adolf Hitler. Julie Dreyfus is excellent as Francesca Mondino with her black poodle and traitorous coupling with Goebbels.\n\nAll in all, Inglourious Basterds is in the running for Tarantino's greatest film. It's not my personal favorite, but I do love it now. I do think most audiences will at least enjoy themselves during this raucous and nerve-wracking journey through war torn France. Give it a try!",

That is why.\n\nIt's practically revenge-against-Nazis pornography, and Tarantino is the Greatest of All Time at producing comically violent cinema. It's a sadistic marriage made in heaven, and this film is the honeymoon.\n\nThe performances in this movie is simply the best. Christoph Waltz steals the show as Hans \"The Jew Hunter\" Landa, a Nazi leader-sociopath so charismatic, murderous, competent, narcissistic, and with-the cherry on top-a flair for theatrical indulgence, he must go down as one of the greatest villains of all time. He's one of those evil characters so sublime, one cannot help but root for him out of guilty pleasure.\n\nBrad Pitt's performance is electrifying and hilarious. As he continually snorts cocaine or whatever-the-hell he's perpetually got in his hands, when he commands \"One hundred Nat-zee scalps,\" my heart and smile grow like I'm the Grinch.\n\nI've never heard of M\u00e9lanie Laurent going into this. After seeing her play Shosanna for no more than 4 minutes, I'm positively in love with her. (Mademoiselle Laurent, if you're reading this: je t'aime.)\n\nOh, and the opening scene between Col. Landa, Perrier LaPadite (Denis M\u00e9nochet), and the Jewish refugees below their floorboards? One of the greatest, most stunningly intense movie scenes I've ever seen.\n\nFurthermore, Basterds has surprising depth to it thanks to its (plausible) fan theories: The plot, and especially the ending, being a subtle middle-finger to Hollywood and the self-congratulatory, clich\u00e9-ridden movie industry itself. Tarantino's script says: Burn it all down! Or, more literally: \"I think this just might be my masterpiece.\"\n\nThe rest is just immensely satisfying, comically over-the-top, quintessential Tarantino violence, in the perfect setting, interspersed with impeccable dialogue. There's much in this movie worthy of more thorough analysis than what's out there right now and/or what I am capable of making.\n\nBottom line: I can think of no other movie that keeps me so purely, indulgent entertained. And is that not the main reason we watch movies?",

Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, this film has no shortage of humor, effective writing, and in true fashion, oh so many deaths. Personally, I really enjoyed the film. Overall, I felt that it was well-written, well-shot, well-acted, well-everything. One of my favorite scenes is Brad Pitt's character's attempt to successfully convey an Italian man, terribly butchering the language and the accent in the process. This film is easily one of the most well done films I have seen in a long time. The editing in the film was definitely a highlight. I particularly enjoyed the initial scene of the film, where Christoph Waltz's character is in search of individuals that may be hiding Jews. The scene itself is paced so slowly, truly building the tension, allowing us as an audience to wait with baited breath to see what is going to happen. There is then a lovely reveal where we see individuals hiding beneath the floor boards, their eyes attentively peaking between each board. This reveal serves as a way to ramp up the tension of the scene, as we wait to see if Waltz's character figures it out and discovers those hidden in the floor beneath him. Scenes such as this almost made me pay greater attention to the film, as I found this cat and mouse build to be incredibly fascinating. I loved that each shot would stay and linger on the characters as they would take in information, calculate their responses, and react. It absolutely made the film so much more enjoyable as a viewer!",

However, this isn't your typical war film, rather a movie that has literally every genre, ranging from drama and sadness from one scene to humor and action to the next. Inglourious Basterds is set in World War 2 in Nazi-occupied France. The movie right away shies from history and creates their own fictional storyline. The film also doesn't take the traditional \"one-story\" plot, rather it contains several different storylines with the characters coming from different backgrounds but possessing similar goals. The main characters are an American soldier, A Nazi, and a Jewish girl. They all cross roads to meet the same desirable goal at the end, though they get to their destination in different ways. Brad Pitt stars as the soldier, a stereotypical loud-mouth yank who does before he thinks, with Christoph Waltz starring as the Nazi detective, who is very calculative and has a very large eye for detail. Perhaps the most important character is Shoshanna, a Jewish girl who  lives in France with falsified documents after witnessing the massacre of her family. Her hate for the Nazis grow deeper as the years pass by, but she has no choice but to blend in. Tarantino excels in putting all of these vastly complicated and unique characters together to maintain a plot that in a way fits all of their natures, with no main character getting the spotlight for too long. Since the film is well over two hours long, it is divided into five chapters. Each chapter focuses on a specific event or issue, which helps the viewer not get lost in the plot. I enjoyed that English was only one of the languages spoken in the film, with German, French, and even Italian being included into the mix. This seeks the viewer further into the World War two setting. The film starts off quite slow in the beginning, with more dialogue than action, but the aftermath of the 2nd chapter is what truly builds up the tension and makes this film memorable. I also enjoyed that the film didn't really depict anyone as the \"good guy\", showing how the protagonists were also like the antagonists in an ironic twist. The antagonist also doesn't share the traditional \"bad guy\" vibe we see from almost every other movie. Inglourious Basterds is like nothing I've ever seen before. It would seem realistic to every film viewer, including myself, that it's impossible to have a movie that has romance, thrills, dialogue, comedy, tragedy, and action packed into a two hour plot, while also breaking away from a traditional storyline and shed new views on the characters each time you watch it. Inglourious Basterds defies all of these odds to become one of Tarantino's masterpieces only next to Pulp Fiction. The film deserves a \"fresh\" review with a fair rating of 8.5/10. I would have rated it higher if the film's speed wasn't quite slow in the first half, but it succeeds in sending its message to the viewers. It's a film with stars in its cast, but the actors and actresses that nobody's quite familiar with become just as memorable with their astounding performances.",

            "content": "Did the writers get hit in the head with a bat? So many things wrong with this movie. Clich\u00e9 and unoriginal BS stereotype that all \"Nadzees\" are automatically evil non-humans who deserve whatever comes to them, and that all Jews are automatically superior saints who can do no wrong. This movie is nothing more than  propaganda to justify the inhumane treatment of, and genocide of, the Germans - by dehumanizing them like any effective hate propaganda does to those it deems the \"enemy\". As someone who detests senseless violence, gore and death, I found this movie not even worth the lowest one gold star rating. If brutality against Germans can be laughed at, it's hypocritical to be offended at laughing at violence waged upon other groups.\n\nIt's not all fiction. This movie does have an element of truth to it - the brutality and inhumane treatment of \"evil Nadzees\" by Jewish supremacist fanatics, and others.* For context: Since the 1800s, within Jewish supremacist circles, the idea of eradicating all Germans (and\nwhites along with Western civilization and Christianity in general) can be found in various quotes from the early Zionist and Communist movement leaders (Moses Hess, Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, etc). As a result, this sentiment grew so much that the Daily Express from March 24, 1934 featured the headline, \"Judea declares War on Germany\". This hatred of Germans and whites in general did not begin due to WW2, but still today we are told to view these groups in a negative light, through movies like this.\n\n*In particular, part of this movie may be based off of the actions of a Jewish supremacist group called Nakam. After WW2, not being satisfied with the already-high number of deaths from the War, Abba Kovner wanted more Germans dead. To accomplish this, his Nakam terrorist group went and abducted random Europeans and drove them out to a forest, where they then shot the innocent Europeans. Another genocidal act was when Abba Kovner's Nakam domestic terrorist group members broke into the concentration camp where German POWs were being held, and coated the bread with arsenic to kill the German POW inmates (called \"Plan B\"). This was after the failed attempt to poison the water supply to kill German civilians in cities such as Hamburg and Munich (\"Plan A\"). Also, Jewish partisan gangs roamed around post-WW2 occupied Germany, seizing and occupying the homes of German refugees. \n\nIn addition to all this, Churchill ordered the expulsion of 15 million Germans from their land, causing 3 million of them to die. From 1939-1945, nearly 7 million German POWs were sent to Soviet gulags, most of them to never return, and anyone fighting the Soviets (including Russians) were deemed \"Nazi collaborators\" were also sentenced to mutilation, rape, torture and death. Also, Eisenhower's camps held 1.7 million Germans who were not fed, not given shelter, were tortured, maimed and murdered at will by the Allied guards. If that wasn't enough to satisfy the sadistic psychopaths who hold a genocidal anti-German rage, after WW2, the Soviets invaded Germany and occupied the eastern half of the country. The brutal rape and murder of 2 million German women and girls took place by mainly Jewish and oriental Soviet units, causing many other German women and their children to commit suicide to avoid that same fate. Why weren't all these events accounted for in the movie? Why was the German male made out to be some evil nonhuman worthy of the most horrific torture, when the average German had no part in war crimes? \n\nAt the end of WW2, Eisenhower said of the Germans, \"It's a pity we could not we have killed more\". The war crimes committed by Jewish supremacists, the Allied leaders and the Soviets should have been acknowledged in this movie, to make it more accurate with reality, and reduce the glaringly-obvious bias of the movie. The Dresden terror bombings were another example of war crimes perpetrated against the German civilians, which scorched a non-military/civilian city, killing countless men, women and children. Incorporating these facts into the movie would impart a more rounded perspective to the viewers, even in a fictionalized genre. Or is the goal to leave the viewers with an ignorant and highly-skewed perspective of history, along with a supposedly- justified hatred for Germans? \n\nBut some more things don't add up. Knowing what we know now: Why was there no mention of the horrors that the Communists/Bolsheviks committed against millions of innocent civilians, under the direction of certain leaders who just happened to be Jewish, in East European countries? For example, all the death and suffering caused by Communists in places like the (then) USSR, Ukraine (esp. Holodomor which killed 8 million people), Katyn Forest Massacre, etc.? Why did Quentin Tarantino not make a similar-themed revenge movie, with the antagonists as Communists? Tarantino seems to have a penchant for revenge fantasies, but this one was just tasteless. I doubt anyone who went through the horrors of WW2 would ever want their horrors twisted into a \"fun\" or \"funny\" perspective. \n\nDisgusting trash. Belongs in the ash heap of history.",

Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz both give Oscar-worthy performances, especially with Waltz speaking FOUR languages throughout; English, German, French, and Italian. Pitt, on the other hand, portrays a perfect blend of Semi-Dumb Southerner stereotype, hilariously awkward, and quietly menacing. The opening scene is one of the best opening scenes of all time, and the standoff in the basement bar is pure cinematic gold. A couple flaws aside, this is a wonderful movie that is definitely not for kids.",

            "content": "'INGLORIOUS BASTERDS' was directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanue Laurent. ?It is the first year of Germany's occupation of France. Allied officer Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) assembles a team of Jewish soldiers to commit violent acts of retribution against the Nazis, including the taking of their scalps. He and his men join forces with Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress and undercover agent, to bring down the leaders of the Third Reich. Their fates converge with theatre owner Shosanna Dreyfus, who seeks to avenge the Nazis' execution of her family.\n\n\nInglorious Basterds is a fantastic war movie. No it is not overrated. It is rated perfectly as far as I'm concerned and is one of Tarantino's best movies. Christoph Waltz is god damn incredible in this movie and provides a truly chilling, milk obsessed villain that will go down in the greatest of cinema. I'm not exaggerating. Tarantino was at his best with this retelling of history. You know what, screw it. This IS how WW2 went down. Tarantino has convinced me of that. I defy anyone to prove me otherwise!\n\n\nLet me break it down how incredible this movie is. The story is a genius intertwining of two entirely separate stories that mould into one during a simple five chapter story. This movie is so well written that it changed history. Tarantino convinced me that this was exactly how WW2 went down. The ending is perfect and mirrors the entire movie as a whole. Well done Tarantino, you done did good!\n\n\nTo top of the excellent story, we have a stellar star studded cast to pimp out Tarantino's epic war movie. Honestly, if Christoph 'The Milkman' Waltz didn't at least get NOMINATED for an Oscar in this movie, I would have started a riot. This was probably one of the best performances in modern movie history and sends shivers down your spine. If one man can make me fear him for ordering a glass of milk, he deserves the Oscar trophy to be redesigned after him. Accompanying Walkz' Hans Landa is Brad Pitt's awesome Aldo Raine who, while having a smaller role than expected, elevated the movie above it's previous pedestal and made me think of Brad Pitt whenever I think of WW2. The jury is still out on whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Diane Kruger was also great as Bridger Von Hammersmark as was Michael Fassbender as Archie Hirox and Daniel Br\u00fchl as the creepy Frederick Zoller. Melanie Laurent was good as Shossana Dreyfus. Martin Wuttke was on steroids or something as Adolf Hitler. Despite possible drug use, he was great as the most evil man to grace this Earth; good look adding that to your resume. \n\n\nThis movie is also nearly technically flawless. The effects were great and the inclusion of blood and gore was, while not necessary, a welcome addition that was the definition of Tarantino style. I will say, however, that some shots and scenes were overly comical and it took me out of the movie for a brief short moments. \n\n\nOne minor, minuscule gripe is with the dialogue. Not to say it was bad, it wasn't but the movie is VERY dialogue heavy and due to the majority of it being in foreign languages, it could sometimes be difficult too keep up with the subtitles and could be sometimes frustrating to decipher what was being said. Probably not an issue for many but was certainly one for me.\n\n\nYou can dislike this movie all you want, I don't care. But if you dare say this movie was made up and FICTIONAL(?), I will hunt you down and... I dunno... order a glass of milk... and then shoot your floor. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, it will change your perception on history and is honestly just an amazing war movie that will stand the test of time.",

He's such charm and charisma that is infectious and entertaining to watch. Tarantino is a master at crafting brilliant cinema. He understands how to build tension even in the slightest of things and then when to release it. It's like a flow, and he really gets it. Tarantino is infamous for his long but very interesting conversations his characters have, and this movie is no exception.\n\nBrad Pitt's character is flawless. Probably my favorite Tarantino character that he's created. And Samuel L. Jackson narrating, ahhhh so fucking good. It's such a serious topic and movie but Quentin is just so good at defusing a situation with humor. This movie has such an intersting and pondering premise. It's one of those ideas that you think about when your starring up at your ceiling thinking about things. It makes you wonder if anything like this really went on. Were there really American military outfits that hunted down and killed Nazi's during the war? It's shit like this that gets the cogs moving and the brain thinking. It's brilliant stuff.\n\nI love how there's chapters in the movie. It's like a book. A really good book that you want to finish reading because it's so damn good. The whole premise of the German Nazi soldier trying to get the French girl, great. The use of music is terrific. Especially during the moments of reveal and tension. Every conversation scene with Waltz is just so magnetizing. He makes acting seem like it's no big deal. Probably comes second nature to him. It's amazing how he plays this character who is just so evil but yet so polite and a gentleman. He's not vulgar he doesn't conduct himself inappropriately. He just does his job as he's supposed maybe better than he should, and is just a gentleman. \n\nMike Myers and Fassbender in the same room. What the hell? Pretty cool. I love Fassbender's laugh. That tavern scene holy shit. The way things were so fun and then all of a sudden things started to get tense until it all explodes at the end. That's the English for you. putting a nonstrategic actress, who has no business in matters of war, in charge of putting a strategy together to meet just to talk. This scene is so genius because it's almost like that one Major is playing the game with them, in order for them to let their guards down in order for them to reveal themselves in some way. This movie reminds me a lot of Barry Lyndon in the way that, it's all in the subtleties. You can tell what's going on or even what's going to happen just by looking at their faces. Again, Quentin builds up this tension that you could already feel coming but it still catches you off guard because of the flawless acting.\n\nBeautiful shot with the French girl leaning on the circular shaped window. I would so go down on that blonde French girl, Jesus Christ. I lost it when Lt. Aldo said Bon Journo. That was hilarious. The whole bit with the Italians and Hans was great. The look on Hans face at the end was priceless. He knew what was coming to him.\n\nI think saying that this movie is a masterpiece, is quite an understatement. This movie is quite a cinematic accomplishment. Amazing work of art. Loved every bit of it. I only wish they covered why Aldo has that scar around his neck. Maybe a lynching? Definitely watching this one again.",

Despite it being a war movie, Tarantino keeps it simple and thorough but not without substance. This allows a comfortable and justifiable conclusion to the narratives. You might think that the American-led team by Brad Pitt are the main attraction, but don't be mislead, the narrative of the French Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) is significant. \n\nWhat makes this an entertaining watch is that it doens't present such a noble and courageous angle on war, the movie is just bloody good fun (the characters are having fun too).That's the case anyway for the Americans here, but for Shosanna, offers a neat fantasy revenge epic that's familiar but inviting\nto watch anyway.",

We have here a rereading of the second war ala Tarantino, to where the Nazis are hunted, first I would like to talk about the first 20 minutes of this movie are fabulous, yes, the first scene lasts 20 minutes, is long, I know, but she did not seasick, quite the contrary, you delighting in every second of it, quite the Christoph Waltz acting work, which is quite spectacular in the film, completely stealing the Brad Pitt scene in the movie, the soundtrack not only that scene, but whole film is spectacular, really, in terms of soundtrack, Tarantino is unique. The photograph of the film is really unbelievable, but this first scene is something surreal, has a color palette with lots of black, gray, white, but has a strong red, it is very balanced, it's really beautiful, all the merits here for Robert Richardson and Sally Menke, not counting the camera angles, it looks like the camera in Tarantino movies is exactly positioned in the place it should be. Well, since we talk about performances, as we talk about photography, we have spoken soundtrack, go to the strength of Quentin, the script, the script is great, a little confused, and some other elongated scenes (like the tavern) and does not have much of those characteristic dialogues Quentin (will not be the opening scene), but it's a good script, which tells a story of revenge to global levels, and creates a character that is already in the history of contemporary cinema, Hans Landa , who speaks French, Italian, German and English and let me terrified enemies with a painted humor, humor that is very well applied in the film. Quentin ends the film with the phrase \"That was my masterpiece\" I disagree with him, Inglourious Basterds not even among the top 3 Tarantino for me, but no doubt is a great movie.",

What I did not like was the blase perspective the movie took on the Holocaust. Even the entire construction of the german detective troubled me. Tarantine made him too funny, too witty, and too likeable. While I do understand this was a mockumentary of sorts, it made me feel guilty to sit there and laugh during some scenes.\n\nAs far as arch, I could see none of no character whatsoever in the film. All the characters ended as they began, making them somewhat superficial and shallow. I did recognize some false foreshadowing with the german war hero actor. When he left the theater it almost seemed as if he had a shred of remorse for killing all those people, but any thread of hope that he was going to arc in any way was destroyed once he forced his way into the theater's projection room.\n\nI do commend the integration of the various languages throughout the film, as it in no way detracted from the pace of the plot. In fact, in many cases I had to rewind the movie to re-read captions due to the face paced nature of the dialogue.\nOverall, while I can appreciate it cinematic elements, this movie made me feel guilty for enjoying it.",

Vor allem aber liefert er ein ganz anderes Ende des zweiten Weltkrieges. Eines, in dem die Basterds das bekommen, was sie verdienen! Die Lust am Wiederentdecken alter B-Movies (denn so einer ist das Original aus dem Jahr 1978), der Western Soundtrack von Ennio Morricone und die kunstvolle 35mm Fotografie zeigt Tarantinos tiefe Liebe zum Kino! \"The Hero\", \"The Nazi\" und \"The Girl\", drei ikonische, liebevoll entwickelte Charaktere aus der Horde von Kriegern, die hinter den Kampflinien der Nazis operieren. Gespielt von Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz und Melanie Laurent, die verstanden haben, dass ein Tarantino Charakter gr\u00f6sser sein muss als das Leben. Ich w\u00fcrde es so sehen: Ihre Gef\u00fchle sind einfach viel gr\u00f6sser als die, die wir aus \"normalen\" Filmen kennen! In einem fr\u00fchen Stadium des Krieges, im besetzten Frankreich, tritt der grausame Nazi Col. Hans Landa (Waltz) auf. Er verd\u00e4chtigt einen Bauern, Juden zu verstecken und beh\u00e4lt recht. Aufgest\u00f6bert muss die junge Frau Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) sich in den Wald fl\u00fcchten. Christoph Waltz kreiert hier einen Nazi Charakter, wie ich ihn nie zuvor sah: Teuflisch und h\u00e4misch, ironisch und absurd! Der \"Hero\", das ist Lt. Aldo Raine, gespielt von Brad Pitt. Pitt spielt eine italienische Karikatur, einen J\u00e4ger, den es nach 100 Nazi Skalps d\u00fcrstet. Das \"Girl\", Shosanna (Laurent) ist eine Sirene mit Kurven und roten Lippen. Sie ist eine sch\u00f6ne Zusammenfassung der Frau in Rot, die uns das Kino der letzten 100 Jahre geliefert hat. Shosanna flirtet mit Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), einem Nazi Kriegshelden, der nun als Schauspieler f\u00fcr Goebbels arbeitet. So wie jeder Tarantino Film entzieht sich Inglorious Basterds einer Kategorisierung. Ein Kriegsfilm? Vielleicht so etwas in der Richtung. Nat\u00fcrlich ist nichts, was geschieht, m\u00f6glich und alles nur grandiose Unterhaltung! Nachdem ich Inglorious Basterds zum ersten Mal sah, war ich mir nicht so sicher, ob das nun der beste oder \u00e4rgerlichste Film des Jahres war. Jetzt hab ich ihn nochmal gesehen und wusste: Tarantino mag einfach wirken, aber doch ist der Zugang nicht einfach. Inglorious Basterds w\u00e4chst mit jedem Mal Sehen. Der beste oder schlechteste? Weder noch. Vielleicht der originellste Film des Jahres!",

Fans of Tarantino's previous works will not be disappointed. Brad Pitt stars as Aldo the Apache, leader of the Nazi-hating, revenge-seeking group the Inglourious Basterds. With the help of the notorious Donnie \"The Bear Jew\" Donowitz (Eli Roth), a man who beats Nazi soldiers with a baseball bat, and other ruthless Ally soldiers, the Basterds' mission is simple-to kill Nazis. Inglourious Basterds unfolds in five chapters, making it easy for the viewer to follow the gripping storyline and keep up with the vital characters in the plot, including a wonderful performance by Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with Quentin Tarantino's work, if you are a fan of gorey, action-packed films, look no further to fill your appetite. Keep in mind that you would not want your children to watch this film. The vulgar language is one thing, but some scenes, such as a man being beaten to death by a bat, will give them nightmares for weeks. Some may frown upon the obscene violence, as they should. I can agree that the violence might be a little too over the top. Despite this, it perfectly captures the gruesome nature of warfare. Overall, Inglourious Basterds provides numerous high-profiled action scenes, with the occasional Tarantino humor mixed within. Some war films might seem to drag on, but Inglourious Basterds is an eye-gripping adventure.",

Brad Pitt gives to us a standout performance in this movie, he plays Lt. Aldo Raine and he is almost unrecognizable in his role. Another standout performance is by Christopher Waltz who plays Hans Landa, a scary smart, badass but sadist \"Jew Hunter\" and makes the audience hate him and root for his demise, which is what was probably intended. Inglorious Basterds is beautifully shot, and the dialogue is amazing, even though more than half of the film is spoken on French and German, though it is sometimes disengaging.

            "content": "Great movie, but there's better Tarantino movies. Inglourious Basterds follows many characters all at once and it would be very hard to explain the story, but I'll just say the important characters and their plot in short. At first we follow a French family who're hiding Jews as a nazi inspection comes to, well, inspect their home for Jews. One girl survives, Shosanna, and changes her name and appearance to blend in with the nazi-occupied France. We follow her for a while, but 4 years later, as she is a cinema manager. Then, at the same time we follow the Basterds. A team of Jew Americans who love killing Nazis. And last, but certainly not the least, we follow the enemy, Hitler mostly. It's divided into chapters and each chapters focuses on one of those three stories, but in the end they all get together in an explosive and brutal finale! Now, I have to admit that this is the second Tarantino movie which became a bit tedious to me after about half of the movie (first being Death Proof). I think the reason for that was the fact that there are many long running scenes of just talking and nothing really important happening, for example the tavern scene, which was very intense, but the wait was very tiresome. The acting in the movie is great, no complaints there. Also, speaking of acting, it was a surprise seeing Mike Myers in this movie! I hoped he would have a bit of a larger role, as I love the actor, but I was satisified by just seeing him again on-screen. The characters are very well made, and I especially loved Eli Roth's Donny and Christoph Waltz's Hans. The scene where the Basterds are pretending to be Italians is priceless! The way Hitler was portrayed in this movie is also quite amusing, to say the least. The movie looks wonderful, and has, again, a very well composed soundtrack that fits in with the scenes perfectly! The ending is very satisfying and I loved the cinema massacre (cinemassacre, if you will)! All in all, a very good Tarantino movie which is a bit overly long, but it's worth watching as it has some truly intense scenes, as well as those that are truly hilarious. I would highly recommend checking it out!",

The strongest of Tarantino's three revisionist history films, sadly I find, provides an even greater level of catharsis today, than in the year it was released.\n\nI remember Christoph Waltz blowing my mind away on my first watch, as this was also the first time I had ever heard his name. That opening scene still gives me the chills and immediately provides a level of tension, gaining every bit of my attention and focus right from the start. Waltz creates a discomforting feeling throughout the film, as I find myself entranced by his portrayal of such an evil character, and he is no less impressive with each watch. I know he would rank extremely high on my list of best performances in a Tarantino film and I will still watch any movie today solely on Waltz's name alone.\n\nThe rest of the cast is totally game as well with many diverse and interesting characters. I always get a kick out of Brad Pitt's accent and demeanor and imagine he was having a blast playing Aldo Raines. Melanie Laurent was equally impressive providing an important balance in tone and adding plenty of grounded emotion which made it possible for the audience to feel most through her experience.\n\nSamuel L.

            "content": "The problem with the war movie genre, through my personal observation, is an unfortunate lack of creative and innovative ideas, as most war films share similar themes and story lines. Much like how the genre was rejuvenated by Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket,\" however, the genre underwent the treatment of one of the most inventive directors of modern film, Quentin Tarantino, with \"Inglorious Basterds.\" The movie was a classic Tarantino flick, containing many of the characteristics found in \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Django Unchained.\" Likewise, it contained many of the same elements that made these films gritty, exciting, and suspenseful. There's no doubt that the violence found in this film was over-the-top. However, it doesn't detract from the film's enjoyment, as it actually adds to edge-of-your seat feeling that is so appealing about Tarantino's unique style. What gives this film, perhaps, an edge over Tarantino's previous films is the suspense which is utterly effective throughout. I've never felt so anxious (in a positive way) when watching a movie. This is partially the result of stellar acting performances from Brad Pitt, Melanie Laurent, and Christoph Waltz. Waltz, in particular, stuck out as an incredible actor, fitting his role perfectly. Pitt's occasional use of comic relief was utilized wonderfully in a film packed with gore, violence, torture, and other serious components. Once again, Tarantino doesn't disappoint. Though the first half seemed a little slow for my liking, the movie was nonetheless one of my favorite Tarantino films, and consequently one of my favorite war films.",

A few days before, I watched Reservoir Dogs with my brother, introducing me to Tarantino movies, and I was ecstatic that my Dad agreed to take me to Inglourious Basterds since the trailers made it look like a good revenge film. I was surprised that the film went beyond this notion and was simply fantastic overall, leaving me smiling as I left the theater.\n\nLet me just say, the early trailers for this film are deceiving. They make it appear that the premise is simply Brad Pitt and his men killing Nazis in a brutal manner throughout. This is definitely not the case, and actually touches on subjects I never would have imagined. Tarantino shows his knowledge for German cinema throughout as the main character of the B plot - Shoshanna - comes to own a cinema, and the Nazis are dealing with where they should hold the premiere for the new film by Joseph Goebbels - Nation's Pride.\n\nThe villain, played by Christoph Waltz, is such an amazing character to watch. At certain points, he exhibits intellect and detective skills near Sherlock Holmes levels, and at other times he makes us laugh with how out of touch he is with certain customs. The first twenty minutes of the film is almost fully dedicated to this Hans Landa, and it proves to be among the best sequences Tarantino has ever written.\n\nI fully believe this film had a better screenplay than Django Unchained, but to me, it makes sense that the academy went with The Hurt Locker for best original screenplay.  It makes sense not because The Hurt Locker fully deserved it, but because The Hurt Locker was a film that this country needed in 2009 to shape our perspective on the war being fought over seas.\n\nWhile Inglourious Basterds is not an accurate depiction of World War II or one of the most important World War II films, it is certainly one of the most fun to watch. It is tense, funny, crowd-pleasing, and at the same time it is a very smart movie with well-developed characters, an intricate plot, meta characteristics, and above all, extremely well-written.  This now holds the spot of my 2nd favorite film by Quentin Tarantino, behind Pulp Fiction.\n\n4.0/4.0",

Hans Landa) steals the show in every scene with an amazing ability to be charming and inquisitive, then turn his expression to one of absolute dread.

Christoph Waltz was particularly great at presenting a calm demeanor, and never betraying his inner thoughts. I also like the way the film starts off with seemingly separate stories that eventually all intertwine for a big climactic finish. If I had any complaint it would be that the end didn't bring quite as much emotional satisfaction as I expected it might, possibly because so many characters I loved ended up dead.

            "content": "Successfully sidestepping the atrocities of WWII, Tarintino's focused direction and carefully orchestrated vision ups the ante with the controversial and stomach turning Inglorious Basters. The almost completely fabricated and twisted yarn is a fanciful comical tale of sweet revenge that's partly historical, partly the product of Tarintino's own fertile, sharp and somewhat morally devoid imagination. \n\nTriggered by a rather enjoyable and correctly spelt 1978's B-Movie, determined to outdo his previous achievements, Tarintino liberally douses his surprising music cues with mesmerising punchy and rhythmic dialogue. The snappy hybrid with approximately 70% subtitles unsettling shifts in tone and pace, flow of anxiety and gradual swelling of excruciating tension leads to umpteen memorable moments intent on conjuring response.\n\nIn keeping with Tarantino's instantly recognisable stylised brand of splatter fare, the otherwise jagged, lengthy and gruesome WWII spaghetti western yarn is broken into five tautly-edited acts. \n\nAct one opens with \"Once upon a time... In Nazi occupied France\". In 1941, Colonel Hans Landa AKA \"the Jew Hunter\" (Christoph Waltz) of the Waffen-SS enters the home and proceeds to interrogate provincial French dairy farmer Perrier LaPadite (Denis Menochet). Under suspicion of giving refuge to a local Jewish Family the charming and seemingly reasonable Landa utilises his multilingual abilities as a homing devise to cunningly extract that the fugitives are hidden under the floorboards. His verbal tiptoeing leads straight into the masochistic carnage of all residents expect for Shoshanna, the famers daughter whom escapes.\n\nJump to three years later, Half-bread Tennessee hick Lieutenant Aldo Raine aka Aldo the Apache assembles a motley crew of Hebrew-heritage American GI's. Their mission is to accompany him behind enemy-lines to send a message of terror to the German powers through Aldo's personal peculiar sadistic style of torcher including a requirement of 100 scalped Nazi's. The lethal unit known only as a mist reputation by the Nazi's of the Third Reich as \"the basterds\" take particular pleasure in beating Nazi's to death with a baseball bat and carving the swastika into the forehead of their victims.\n\nShoshanna, the 1941 massacre soul survivor has assumed the identity of \"Emmanuelle Mimieux\" and is now the proprietor of a Parisian cinema. Unwittingly sparking the interest of spotlight-hungry sniper-turned-actor Frederick Zoller (Daniel Br\u00fchl) Shoshanna is bribed into hosting  the premier of his new uplifting Nazi propaganda film Stolz der Nation (A Nation's Pride), a celebrated retelling of Zoller's battle exploits.\n\nThe exclusive premier becomes a ground zero target for both party's murderous plots when all leading Nazi's agree to attend, including Goebbels, Bormann, Goering and even the high strung Fuher himself.\n\nAldo hatch's a plan to infiltrate the theatre's premier and cut the head of the Third Reich's power bring about the end of war, Whilst Shoshanna plans to exact revenge with the help of her resistance contacts and  projectionist boyfriend Marcel (Jacky Ido) by setting light to her highly flammable film stock and burning her own theatre. However, will the methodical investigations of Colonel Hans foil both plans? \n\nWhat differentiates Inglourious Basterds from Tarintino's previous works is its sheer playfulness. Tarantino does digress, as is his wont, but his irritating indulgences are less pandered making way for this thought-provoking concoction to spew its venom.\n\nTarintino's casting is once again flawless to a fault. The magnificently sculpted script is intensified by sublime performances throughout.  However unusual, alleged villain Austrian-born Christoph Waltz's elegantly seamless language gymnastics and beautifully measured exquisitely sadistic style stealing the light, even Brad Pitt's fun but highly underrated comical moustache twitching, folk-wisdom-spouting and cringe worthy twangy Southern drawl is not match.\n\nThe Verdict: The highly publicised and supposedly gratuitous gore to which Tarintino fans have become accustomed is simply not shocking. Perhaps not for the faint of heart the Mexican standoff of talent, story and comedy emanates vindicating its half-mocking and morally reprehensible historical lust for war.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 04/09/2009",

            "content": "If you're looking for a gruesome, bloody, violent, but darkly humorous and interestingly charming Tarantino epic then, well, I think it's clearly apparent by now that you've found it. Of the many WWII films out there, this one is indeed a bit different. A lot happens but it is not difficult to follow. I found myself excited to see what would happen next more often than I expected, even though the plot was somewhat predictable at times. It was about as entertaining as a crusade against Nazis could be.\n\nTarantino structured the film well. He successfully avoided some of the more stupid or absurd Nazi stereotypes, or put his own spin on them so that they were more tolerable. I didn't find the fact that the Basterds were Jewish to be an idea as particularly compelling as I initially expected, but it still remained an entertaining irony. The acting was superb and convincing; I never once imagined that anyone's heart wasn't in it. The brutality, the blood, gore and destruction did not disappoint. It was exhilarating, even.\n\nI think this idea of \"ingloriousness\" is perhaps the most significant aspect of the movie. It does sometimes diminish from the plot's shock factor because you tend to have a good idea about what is going to happen. But the good part of this is that, regardless of predictability, the scenes never fail to satisfy. No matter what, it never seems as though Tarantino is desperately throwing freshly slaughtered carcasses to the wolves. Rather, he has prepared a very lovely dinner for them, in a banquet hall at a five star hotel, consisting of filet mignon cooked medium rare, smothered in wild herbs and spices and topped with a chive butter. The side dishes consist of fresh peppered potato cakes and an ornamented mixture of steamed vegetables including moisturized buttered carrot mash, a puree of celery, and chopped onions to represent soil and broccoli heads to represent trees and shrubs, and ground parsley as grass. As if that's not enough, for dessert there is French Vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate almond syrup, pecans and Kentucky bourbon mixed with cherry coke. Once the wolves are done eating they shake Tarantino's hand and exit the hotel. Upon entering and starting their luxury SUV, rubbing their bellies after the delicious meal and telling some classy jokes, Tarantino, standing in the doorway of the hotel, pulls out a machine gun and blows the wolves' heads off. Subsequently, the vehicle explodes in a barrage of fiery destruction.\n\nTarantino lights a cigarette and tries to pretend that he doesn't notice the carnage, although everybody knows he's loving it.",

Much like Pulp Fiction Basterds is told, not like a novel adaptation, but like a novel--though Basterds is not a book adaptation to begin with, just Tarantino and his creative madness. \"Inglourious Basterds\" is essentially Tarantino's fictitious alternative ending to WWII, told in two different P.O.V's who are both, unknowingly, working towards the same goal, and ultimately doing it in the same fashion--\"killing all the eggs in one basket\" by burning a cinema down which is home to the gathering of Hitler's Third Reich for a propaganda film \"Nation's Pride\". I most enjoyed following the exciting, evolving plot of this film in that it was unpredictable and complex--yet still easily followed. Knowing that Tarantino spent a little over a decade writing the script, from scene one you feel the rigorousness and preciseness in the script with every line of dialogue, every plot development, every character action, and so on. Each individual scene is almost as satisfying as, say, a fully gratifying hour-and-a-half feature film, but Basterds has a whole other hour to it's running time. On your first watch (which, I'll tell you, is not going to be your last) that could be a minor negative--an excess of impeccable scenes. Most Tarantino films, on your first viewing, will usually suffer from too much of a good thing, but, visiting the film for the second time, you'll take in every rigorously scripted scene. Christoph Waltz gives, arguably, his most expansive, if not, best performance. There's suspense, humor, deceivability, and playfulness in Waltz's impeccable performance. There's Tarantino's bombastic, subversive style to add to the film's attributes, the satirical violence, the quirkiness, etc. \"Inglourious Basterds\" blends in with Tarantino's filmography--it's got all the Tarantino stereotypes--yet sticks out from all the others with it's superior artistic value.",

Tarantino dialogue is something immensely different. The casual movie goer may be intimidated by the two and a half movie run time. Despite this, I kept with every line and even paced the living room at certain points (such action from me is a sign that I really like the film). \n\nEven the presence of characters such as Aldo Raine and especially Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa beckoned me to keep attention. Whenever Waltz has entered a scene in any film I've seen he presents himself well and in this case it is no different. He commits terrible acts of violence, but at the same time he's enjoying strudels, drinking glasses of milk, etc. I consider him one of my favorite actors of today because he can bring a charm to any character.\n\nOther things that also encompass what I liked include the soundtrack to this film (which Tarantino tends to do well), the bloody violence that is also a Tarantino staple, the steady/fluid movement behind the camera, and perhaps just the environment itself.

Revisiting it 6(!?) years later, and watching it in two sittings, Inglorious Basterds stands up. Yes, Brad Pitt still sucks in it (and I love that man, don't get me wrong), and the Jewish-Female-Interracial-Coupler protagonist is a bit too on-the-nose, but goddamn is there entertainment to be had.\n\nAs was widely noted upon release, Christoph Waltz' performance is legendary. It's completely frightening and totally theatrical; perhaps it works so well because he feeds into the horror we all feel about actors, people who can convince us they are someone they aren't. \n\nThe pacing is a little off, perhaps because it follows 2 groups, and therefore not a standard three act structure.

Inglorious Basterds is a well shot, kick ass, badass, well acted and well directed film. The story of this film is pretty simple and extremely entertaining and it just makes you support the main characters SO much. (Part of it is because they want to kill Hitler) I would not say Brad Pitt is the main character. He does an absolutely brilliant performance but I don't think there is a main character they are all pretty equal and are all brilliantly acted. Plus I love how most the film is spoken German or French it makes the film so much more \"Realistic.\" Anyway, Inglorious Basterds is a brilliant good watch and definitely worth the time. 8.8/10",

            "content": "I'll probably be hated but fuck it....This movie is ok not bad but not amazingly good as so many other are complimenting this film to be. Is it because I don't understand whats going on nor like Taratino's style No that's BS cause i enjoy all of his other works. This film I feel is the hypnotizing effect that people are so delusional to think that something that is ok is the greatest film of the year. Let me explain why\n\nThis film is marketed to the audience of focusing on the \"Bastards\" a rogue US military squad (that are Jews apparently cause no one else hates the Nazis) that kills well Germans in an alternate WW2 timeline. I say alternate because spoiler at the end of the film the Bastards kill everyone of the third reich command. Unfortunately there is a huge middle that everyone even critics fail to realize.  30 min of the film focuses on the Bastards \"killing\" people (and by killing I mean 1 shootout and the rest of people scalping germans and laughing at how brutal they are) The rest focuses on some French Jewish chick who runs a movie theater that nobody cares about (yet audience does cause we need a female that'll kill people). If the film doesn't focus on the bastards why have them in the movie, marketed. Instead this film should've been called the tedious sabotage tale that would never ever happen.\n\nFilm takes place in France when a more suitable place should've been Germany. Tarantino stated that his movie isn't supposed to be historically accurate ... ok then... But...IT CAN STILL BE LOGICAL. Germany would never film a War propaganda film in Paris (Nazi Germany wanted their nation to be the artistic cinema culture hub of Europe), the entire 3rd reich would never see a propaganda film in Paris, and Adolf Hitler wouldn't have gone anyways. I Paris a lot because LOGIC needs to be here SPOILER later on in the film Waltz negotiates with Brad Pitt in allowing their theater bomb assassination plot to kill Hitler & Reich to continue if Waltz is dropped of his war crimes, becomes a war hero for the allies, and lives in a nice home in the US. Allie command agrees to the terms and they drive to Allied territory. Where is the allied territory? NORMANDY (Northern France), HItler has gone to see a movie in Paris while his enemies are at his doorstep.??!?!?!?!??!?!? Still think the movie is amazing critics. \n\nI am very well aware of his Spaghetti Western Style but all of his other films have great: action, characters, soundtrack, adventure (of going from place to place not jumping ahead like this film), suspense, and most importantly realism. Everything his other films have Bastards has a strong lack of. The characters are just there to \"kill\" no horrors of war no trauma no motivations for betraying their country to do rogue things just kill kill kill even Nazi motivation Waltz states \"we don't know why we hate the jews they're just there to be killed cause thats the natural order of things\" (Not exactly what he says but close enough) What a fucking joke.  pacing of the film is aweful yes Spaghetti Westerns are long movies but they have adventure interesting characters and a great soundtrack to keep you engaged this one doesn't cause jump to a French theater girl. \nIt sounds like I'm bashing this film But I'm not. Im trying to express my opinion on the film and get people even film critics, who have years of experience, to realize that this film isn't as great as people claim.\n\nThe film is ok. As it has the good concept and everything from cinematography, soundtrack, action, acting, and soundtrack are just ok: nothing special. Pacing &  adventure are the biggest problems as there is a lack of focus on the Bastards who are the much more interesting characters that jumps to them in a new location without much setup (Just poof I'm here).

            "content": "Over the many decades, cinema has tried furiously to re-imagine just about every war this world has ever seen. From Vietnam to Iraq, French Revolution to Scotland vs England during the era of William Wallace. Now although some, like Braveheart, are completely historically inaccurate, many strive to be as real to true events as possible, and with a tried and tested formula, Inglourious Basterds could easily have taken the safe route to success. However after the lull, Death Proof, that made just about everyone question his reletivity in cinema, Tarintino decides to create a alternate version of events surrounding the 2nd world war. One in which Germany are winning the war and have managed to occupy France. However working from behind enemy lines are a collective called The Basterds, a Jewish/American guerilla force that pick of the Nazi's one by one, taking their scalps as trophies and really pissing in Hitlers Cornflakes. Ergo Operation Kino, which sets a plot in motion to assassinate Hitler and his band of merry men, once and for all in a screaning of one of Geobils self directed movies. Having the movie stir the history up into new territory turns the events of the early 40's into a fresh and exciting one, yes Tarintino does his job well at grounding events, so as to make the film not buckle under its false situation, but for the most part fictional characters and new and absurd situations arise, that spin how the western world finished the war into complete fictional bombast. The film bolsters quite the cast, Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, Diane Kruger, Mike Meyers, Daniel Bruhl and Melanie Laurent. It even throws in some voice over work from Sam Jackson, just before you Tarintino fan boys have your hissy fit. Being his strong suit, aside from scriptwriting, Tarintino's casting ability has never been questionable and here is no different. Brad Pitt is remarkably hilarious as Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds, he chews the screen within an inch of its life, Michael Fassbender, although with a brief appearance, is magnetic and fully commited to the material, Kruger is excellent as the double agent/actress, even Melanie Laurent and Daniel Bruhl's sequences together are very hypnotic and full of charm. It is however Mr Waltz as Hans Landa, \"The Jew Hunter\", who steals the show from pretty much beginning to end. About 75% of Basterds is given off in French, German and Italian, here Waltz not only learns the languages, including english, impeccably but the dialect also. He slithers through languages so effortlessly it is a show stomper of a performance. But thats not all, every scene he is in, is captivating, edge of your seat, bat shittingly memorable, that were it not for his inclusion, this film would tumble completely off its frantic tracks. Tarintino went as far as to ensure Waltz's ability prior to even going ahead with filming, with his inclusion actually making the film possible in the first place, as Tarintino said himself, he would not have filmed it were it not for Waltz being perfect in the role, a choice the director nailed perfectly. Even almost 10 years on, I cannot think of a single thespian out there who could deliver what Waltz does on screen here, he is the ships engine and with Quentin captain of the ship, its one fast paced journey, you dont really want to miss. The writing is wonderful, for the first time ever Tarintino outdoes himself by making every language feel proper and authentic, he even goes as far as to strip back his usual dialogue staples. The script is whitty and full of language, gorgeous and effective dialogue that really allow for even the lesser actors, like Eli Roth, to come across as seemless. Ive already went into a bit about his new world but he crafts it so perfectly it doesnt even stick or rub against you. It was also noted that The man himself filmed this in very quick succession, however watching through, you realise you are watching a very long movie with essentially 5 short stories coming to the same conclusion. In trademark style each one labelled as chapters, this would be a death nail in some other directors hands, however, the relevance and the pacing of all chapters are precise. Each one working of another to create a tense and thrilling experience. Quentin could has easily went overboard, however investing in a more character driven plot, we relate to the crazy characters and the world they envelop. The camera work is gorgeously cinematic and pristine, riffing on everything from war movies in general to spagetti western, Menke also manages to deliver a tight edit that stays true to Tarintino's style, yet offers up something new. One stand out mark for me is actually the use of the wide shot in this movie, it gets used to such a great effect, bridging distance and class between characters, before coming in closer. It allows us to feel detached, just enough to want to jump in more, it draws your eyes into the frame, making you ache for a close up. Very few directors pull the off but mix that with some outstanding tracking shots, jib shots, focus pulls and stripped back camera set ups, the film just feels tightly packaged. Like the director knew exactly every single shot he wanted and needed and i get the feeling, very few if not any camera angles were left out. I also cant talk about a Tarintino film without mentioning the soundtrack and here, all but one song, by Bowie annoyingly, are perfect for setting the tone and theme. Dont get me wrong, i love Bowie but its inclusion brings us straight out of an otherwise compelling partnership. All its amazement aside the film does have some rigorous flaws that stop it from being a wild, off kilter master piece. One flaw i found was the films lack of time to invest in a lot of the background players, mainly speaking, if you are not Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz or Melanie Laurent, your motives and story become slightly translucent. For example Michael Fassbender, although tremendous in the movie, only really gets just enough exposition to warrant his appearance in the film. I wanted to know more about him, emotionally and historically but he just kind of glides in and blows back out again. The film even goes as far to introduce characters such as The Bear Jew and Hugo Stigletz only to hype them up to ultimately feel disposable. Its a minor flaw but Tarintino has managed in the past with bigger and more impressive casts, so with something so small and honed in, its hard to see why it wasnt possible here. More proof of this would be Denis Menochet, who plays Pierrer Lapodite, this man actually gets equally the same amount of screentime as Fassbender, yet Tarintino finds it more important to flew his character out a lot more that someone who is integral to the plot. That being said, the opening chapter is without a doubt the best thing about the entire movie and considering it sets the pace for the entire thing, i can see why he might have wanted to spend a meticulous amount of time on it. My biggest gripe is the movies way of pulling you out of its world, if its not Bowie singing 30 years before his time, its Sam Jackson, sorry Sam. Shoehorned in are pointless voice overs from Sam that stick out hilariously, where a simple flashback or exposition could have been given, its almost like Sam is pausing the movie and explaining the movies exclamation marks. Although it just about works for the introduction of Hugo it completely alienates the viewer as an idiot when later on used to explain how film back in the 1940's was extremely flammable. I cant quite work out why these moments are in here, it almost seems like fan service and not in a good way. On the whole Basterds is the best thing Tarintino has served up to this very day since Jackie Brown and I hate to say it, may have been his last. Not that Django or The Hateful Eight are or will be trainwrecks, however this feels like one of the characters final lines in the movie \"This may well be my masterpiece\" with just the right hint of doubt and confidence, summing up his career.",

Now that I think about it some more, it was a matter of inconsistency of tone and pointless violence.\n\nWith \"Inglorious Basterds\", Tarentino didn't seem to know exactly what kind of movie he was making and he switched back and forth between styles with no rhyme or reason. I know people say that's his \"style\", but he has proven he can work within his \"style\" and still make a movie that works within its own universe if nowhere else. Here he jumped so randomly between Parisian/subtitled art house movie to exploitation flick to war drama with such quickness that the story lost all sense of flow and I was constantly being knocked out of the movie like a car crash. I have seen these three styles worked together before and to do it well you have to flow one into the other as a consequence of the story and not a jump cut that seem to exist only as a result of the director's inability to blend them together.\n\nAs far as the violence goes I really don't mind gory, even gratuitous violence, as long as it serves the story and doesn't merely exist as a gag. For instance the difference between the Hitler skull destruction scene near the end when compared to a similar death in \"Glory\". In \"Glory\" a commander's head popped like a ripe zit during a close up and splattered everyone around him in dripping bits of brain matter and hair. Over, done, quick and pointed. It made its impact and moved on. In \"Inglorious Basterds\" the violence is such a distinct entity in the exploitation sections of the movie that it felt like Tarentino was sitting around with some buddies saying, \"hey you know what'd be so super gross?!\" and then he built a movie around it. It never felt like it served a plot or a direction for the story. Even \"Hobo With A Shotgun\" seemed to have a reason for most of the gratuitous violence it showed and there was a consistent tone to the film. That movie was messed up beyond all reason, but the film makers kept us firmly rooted in a world that made sense, at least to itself and it obeyed its own rules.\n\nIf this had been a clips movie of short films and it were edited into distinct sections where one third was the straight narrative of the girl, one third was gory exploitation, and one third was the ending where they come together, all presented one right after the other instead of interspersed within one another I might have found a middle ground with the movie. As it was I just didn't enjoy it. Editing it differently may have provided us with a far better movie.",

It's visual craft, it's epic soundtrack of archived instrumentals, the power-house performances by almost all of the actors involved, and probably most of all, the rich and densely composed screenplay. My issues with the film only consist of my petty preferences. Why was I so annoyed that the majority of the movie was spoken in different languages? I'll never know. Maybe it's because I've been so spoiled by the fact that QT is a master of the English language. Hearing his movies through any other would seem sinful.

But the film sometimes tends to drag on and on. Of course it is setup but that still doesn't excuse this from a flaw. I wanted to learn more about the \"Basterds\" in the film.

With the exception of 'Kill Bill', I don't think the guy has made a movie below the standard of \"really good\", and the boldly titled 'Inglourious Basterds' is no exception. It's got everything you would expect: brutal violence, amazing dialogue, excellent performances, gorgeous cinematography, an infectious soundtrack and that unique Tarantino flare that I can honestly say is totally unique to his movies. There's something about the way he stages a scene, uses character traits and slowly reveals information that is so tense and riveting; and this is particularly seen in the opening of the movie - one of the best in recent memory. It's not perfect, though. Some scenes in the first half drag a little and the running time could definitely have been trimmed down, but the finale makes it all worthwhile, with a highly satisfying ending.

            "content": "You know you've seen a good film when it's two and a half hours long and it feels like no time has gone by at all. Inglorious Basterds is an expectedly strange offering by Quentin Tarantino, but it sure is awesome.\n\nAfter the first scene in the house I was amazed by how much time had gone by, Tarantino really knows how to write a script, I could watch a 2 hour movie of just people talking and if he wrote and directed it, I'd watch it. The story has multiple subplots which are the norm for him and they all intertwine to give us a very bizarre string of situations but is never boring at all. However, after all was said and done I couldn't help but feel not much had happened in the two and a half hour timeframe. These people plan to do one thing and then plan to do another thing and then they do it. While it certainly is a better film than that sounds, and I like films that have a small little scenario like this one that have great build up, it still got to me at the end when I just had a thought that really not much happened. \n\nThe film is wonderfully directed by Tarantino and his references to classic films didn't feel out of place considering where the story takes place and left it mostly quirk free, besides the delightfully old school soundtrack. However, for a few seconds in some scenes it just had some random imagery on the screen that had no context behind it or any meaning and took me out of the experience for a little bit. Also, the editing on some scenes was terrible, a scene, for example, would have some music behind it that was just starting to rev up and then the scene would just end. I can't help but feel that if some other director made this film it'd have mixed reception because it messes around with history and has some really goofball scenes, but because it's Tarantino, that's okay, it's his thing.\n\nThe acting is really the best thing about this film and makes it so enjoyable and exciting to watch, everyone does a fantastic job. People say Brad Pitt, and his McConaughey accent, was an odd choice for this film but really, Eli Roth, is much stranger, while no doubt good in his role when he first showed up I couldn't help but feel him and his silly faces to be totally out of place but given how everything else is, he fits just fine. The best thing about the cast, is the scene stealer himself, Christoph Waltz, I'm so happy Tarantino brought mainstream attention to him and ever since has had a great career, the only complaint in regards to him is that he should have been in it a lot more. Even if someone didn't like the film, everyone agrees that he was excellent. \n\nFrom what I have written it probably comes across like I didn't like this film at all but the opposite is true; a film that left a smile on my face after all is said and done has to do something right. I really enjoyed my time and liked all the dialogue, it isn't easy making a two and a half hour film feel like five minutes but he did it. You never know what's coming next and the great cast bring the characters fully to life, it certainly is a unique experience and a totally engrossing one.",

            "content": "Another viewing cut short.  To say I dislike this movie isn't a sufficient description; I fundamentally disapprove of it.  Its primary purpose is for Quentin Tarantino to construct all the elements that could make a really solid movie and cover it with garbage, shaving cream, and cool whip.  It is an affront to the very notion of storytelling, which is timeless, unlike Quentin Tarantino's talent as a director.  \n\nThere are two movies operating concurrently here.   One is a tale of anger and trauma, fundamentally rooted in the timeless qualities of storytelling, based around Melanie Laurent's jewish survivor, and the playfully sadistic Nazi officer played by Christolph Waltz (the one piece of acclaim this movie justifiably received).  Tarantino proceeds to mash this up with a nonsensical plot involving a squad of Jewish GI's led by a Southern Officer, pantomimed by Brad Pitt in full-on dumbface, a performance fitting the villain of a Three Stooges episode.  The fundamental problem is not that the violence is intentionally exploitative and sleazy, although it is.  The problem is that Tarantino has put together pieces which could be a part of a strong narrative, with numerous fine qualities, and then peed all over it while laughing hysterically.  There are many here among us that think that life is but a joke.  But this isn't Monty Python, its closer to an attempt at Dada by a 13-year old Tarantino fan, and thats the point.  Tarantino is happily stuck in infantile regression.  He has become no better than a hack imitator of himself.   \n\nThe critical establishment once hailed Tarantino as the future of American Cinema, but he has instead become the inspiration and driving force of much of its self-conscious descent into grime and stupidity.  Can we just take Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth, Robert Rodriguez and all their ilk and put them in a zoo?",

I really appreciated the fact that I almost never knew what was going to happen next and kept me guessing. This film is under the direction of Quentin Tarantino who makes this another classic under his belt. His direction in the movie is phenomenal as always. He does camera angles and shots that no other director would do. There's a scene where Aldo is talking to a German through a translator and the camera pans across each of their faces every time they talk and through one shot too. Things like that make his direction stand out from other directors. The story is very well rounded out since everyone's stories intertwine and come together as one big final act that I was really impressed with. It's at times heartless and at times its emotional, the film has a wide range of emotions that are felt throughout viewing for sure. There's also a lot of American spirit too, the Basterds are like defenders of what is right and punishing the Nazis which gave me a real fist pump feel. It felt like \"Yeah America!\" and it helps make it even more of an American classic. The acting was very good from the talents of Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Melanie Laurent, and Michael Fassbender. These actors were great throughout the movie. Michael Fassbender, even though he was only on screen for a smaller time he still have a really memorable performance. There was this looming suspense that kind of stuck around the entire movie that I thought was a nice touch. It's a war movie and you don't know if this character is going to snap or not and if this guy is going to figure out she's not German. It made for a really tense setting. There were some very great scenes but my favorites being the final act at the theater and the introduction of the Basterds. Overall Inglourious Basterds stands out as being a really good American film that promotes freedom and liberty amongst all. It provided a really cool 2 and a half hours of cool conversations and well executed fight scenes. B+",

            "content": "Quentin Tarantino is one of those directors who likes to shake up premises for movies in a great way. For example Reservoir Dogs is a heist movie where you don't see the heist, Django Unchained is a movie where we have a black cowboy killing white people in a time of oppression. Inglourious Basterds is a movie where you have Jews killing Nazis. This is a great movie and one of Tarantino's best. This movie has an amazing cast, Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Til Schweiger, a brief appearance from Mike Myers and the voice of Samuel L Jackson. Brad Pitt is so good in this movie he's very likes or and has a lot of funny lines. Christoph Waltz is a brilliant villain and deserved his Oscar for this movie. Quentin Tarantino directs this film amazingly, he adds his unique touch to this movie and it's brilliant. This film is also very tense, the opening scene will have you on the edge of your seat. The bar scene is nail biting and has an amazing pay off. This film also has some very funny moments, a lot of which comes from the amazing script. As with all Tarantino movies the dialogue is fantastic, it all feels so natural. This film has a great climax it's all really well done and has an amazing kill that will satisfy everyone. Even though this movie is about world war 2 this film is in no way historically acurate so if you want to see a historically acurate world war 2 movie then this isn't it. This film like all Tarantino movies is very gory so don't watch it if you can't handle violent movies. In my opinion Inglourious Basterds is a near perfect movie however some of the stuff with Shosanna and Fredrick Zoller does go on a bit too long but just like Pulp Fiction this is an amazing movie with one over long sequence. This is an absolute masterpiece and one of Tarantino's best. It's one of my favourite movies and it's just so good. A+",

A revenge fantasy set during World War II, this film features an excellent cast playing characters who are rarely what they seem. A young Jewish woman on the run in occupied Paris; a redneck American undercover officer leading a squad of Nazi-scalping thugs; a suave, multi-lingual SS officer who is as sharp as Sherlock Holmes. Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz turn in astounding performances as the redneck and the SS officer, respectively.\n\nThere is the trademark brutality, but it's the dialogue scenes that are memorable. Verbal jousting between characters who are trying to hide things from each other, but most likely already know each other's secrets. Absolutely mesmerizing.",

            "content": "Grade:Lower 8/10\n\nInglorious Basterds, a film about Nazi's, violence and Jewish\nvengeance, what is not to love about it. With it's long Dramatic scenes\nto it's more sadistic scenes Inglorious Basterds manages to make a film\nthat it just simply fun to watch and also kind of a bit insane. From\nthe mind of a man who has made some of the best violent films of all\ntime, you have to expect a little blood and you get it too, I\npersonally felt that the film was firmly very good, and here is why I\nthink so below.\n\nThe story is fun and energetic and although it starts of in a darker\ntone than most of the film goes in, it still manages to pack fun and\naction that is half humorous half absurd. I especially enjoyed that the\nfilm doesn't take itself too seriously as a history piece and as is\nseen in the final scenes, they have never read a history book but it\nworks and you feel you have thoroughly entertained as well. Finally the\nplot also works well as the characters bring so much diversity to it\nwith varied performances that just the make the story even better.\n\nThe cast do a solid job and although I did feel Brad Pitt at the helm\nwasn't anywhere near his best, as a group it goes well anyways. I as I\nthink many others loved the deliciously evil Christoph Waltz as the\nNazi officer who is a weirdly kind of nice person who also can\nslaughter everyone he comes into contact with. I did feel actors such\nas Michael Fassbender and Til Schweiger Were under used and had a lot\nmore promise to give the story but it doesn't hurt the music that badly\nat all. Lastly on the cast, Melanie Laurent does a great job, and\nhaving seen her mainly in Romance's and straight Drama's, this is a\nmajorly good turn for her.\n\nTarantino writing and directing does a job that is rare in film,\nproducing yet another at the least Very Good film and he isn't finished\nyet either. He crafts this sweetly with his fine touches of brilliance\nand although this isn't his best, it does a job in itself. Eli Roth\nhelps Tarantino with the directing and is uncredited so maybe a shout\nto him for his help, on another note although the gore may disturb\nsome, I have to say the prosthetics used are magnificent and\nbeautifully crafted into some horrible looking wounds, great work from\ncostume too make this a respectfully good looking film + great\ncinematography used also.\n\nThe film is very long yes, and by the end is can start to drag also\nwith some parts where you just want them to leave and move, but in any\ncase it is fun even for the running time. Sometimes the violence and\ngore can seem very unnecessary and as if they could have just the left\nthat person alone for the sake of not offending the viewers senses, but\nyet again it somehow manages to do it well enough to not offend you,\nwell in my case it didn't but some people will dislike this film with a\nvengeance.\n\nI think Tarantino fans will love this as he continues his good work on\nand on and with a completely different setting we see him grasp new\nsituation, so it is fun. Those who also like War setting films should\nenjoy as it truly grasps certain elements that other popular WW2 films\nhave taken, although this isn't really based on any WW2 missions and it\nisn't the US army so just a heads up. Those who hate blood etc will\nabsolutely dislike this so stay away, I don't want to put people off\nbut I guess you have to be warned before you criticise it. \n\nOverall a lower 8/10 from me, it was Firmly Very Good and although at first I\nwas saying it was Great and Excellent, I gradually lowered it as I felt\nit is of course very good just not any higher than that. Sit back and\nenjoy Tarantino at his best though and although this isn't so much on\npar with \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"Kill Bill\", it still turns out Very Good\ntruly showing the talent of this man as both Director and Writer,\nhere's to another load of years of his work.",

            "content": "\"A BASTARD'S WORK IS TO KILL NAZI'S\"  \n\n- 'Inglorious Bastards' is a 2009 war film from Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill). The plot is a fictional story about two different groups trying to assassinate the top of the Nazi Regime. It's title is a reference to the 1978 film 'The Inglorious Bastards'. In his typical way Tarantino mixes long dialogues with sudden brutal action. In my opinion it is not his best work, but I did enjoy it, especially the brilliant performance of Christoph Waltz (Django Unchained) as Hans 'the Jew Hunter' Lanza. Other famous cast members are Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Michael Fassbender (Prometheus), Eli Roth (Hostel), Diane Kruger (Troy) and M\u00e9lanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus. \n\nFour years after her family was killed by SS Colonel Hans Lanza (Waltz) the young Jewish Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent) changed her name into Emmanuelle Mimieux and runs a cinema in Paris. When she meets German Sniper Frederick Zolter, who starred in a Propaganda film, he falls in love with her and convinced Joseph Goebbels to hold the premiere at her cinema. As the top of the Nazi Regime will be present, Shosanne comes up with a plan to kill them all and avenge her dead family.\n\nIn the meantime, the British intelligence has plotted an assassination attempt of their own called 'Operation Kino'. They have send Lieutenant Archi Hicox (Fassbender) to France to meet up with Aldo 'The Apache' Raine (Pitt) and his 8 Jewish-American soldiers who are killing the enemy on hostile grounds. Aldo likes his men to scalp Nazi heads as trophies. His right hand is Donny 'The Jew Bear' Donowitz (Roth) who whacks his victims with a baseball bat. Together Hicox must rendezvous with German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Kruger), who works as an agent and will help them to get into the cinema.",

Much like you are told to use chapters whilst writing essays, it appears that films should be dealt with in a similar fashion. The variety of different story lines ensures that the action never becomes boring, and instead gradually leads us to our grand conclusion. The acting throughout is truly admirable, with special mentions inevitably going out to both Waltz and Pitt. As all of our characters descend on the concluding destination, an exciting finale is created. This does not disappoint, and perfectly finalises an truly gripping picture. A willingness to kill off seemingly important characters is an ongoing theme of the film. This brilliantly prevents the storyline from being predictable, and keeps the viewer well and truly on the edge of their seats.",

            "content": "Altering history has never been this good or entertaining.  Undoubtedly one of 2009's best films, and one of Tarantino's best.  Set during World War II, Basterds (purposely spelled like that) follows a group of Jewish citizens leading a rebellion against the Nazis in order to weaken their forces, and an owner of a cinema who escaped death or capture years before the events of the rebellion suffers issues with the Germans as they want her to make a film and show a private screening of the film at her theater, giving her the opportunity to burn the place down and kill the Germans attending.  Quentin Tarantino once again shows off his unique style of filmmaking by adding graphic violence, a long runtime, dark humor, and himself in a small role or cameo.  While Inglorious Basterds does alter the events of World War II, Tarantino redeems the inaccuracies by offering a premise and concept never put to film before (I believe).  The idea of Jews fighting the Germans is hard to imagine, but Tarantino makes it real by offering a smart script, which is aided by his incredible direction, Robert Richardson's cinematography, incredible production values and visual effects, and great acting, especially from Christoph Waltz as SD Standartenf\u00c3\u00bchrer Hans Landa, who won his first Oscar for his work (he would later win for Django Unchained, another Tarantino film).  The film's dark humor just make this film oh so funny, especially with its well-crafted dialogue, and multi-layered performances, where most of the laughs come from Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Raine, the leader of the Basterds.  Something else memorable from this movie is the small but enjoyable Mike Myers cameo, showing us a side of acting he's never used before, and of course is struggling to find work thanks to the Love Guru.  Entertaining, bloody, and full of Tarantino contributions, this is a must-see for anyone who loves Tarantino, or who wants to see WWII play out differently.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nWhen someone labels the best directors to have ever lived, one name should definitely come to mention Quentin Tarantino. Now, I'm not gonna fawn over Tarantino cause he had some really bad films like Kill Bill and Four Rooms.  However, when he's at his best, none can ever match.  When I first watched Basterds, I hated it, mainly cause I was a foolish 12.  Now that I'm 16, I can truly enjoy Basterds.  Seriously, this film was amazing!  I used to think Django Unchained was Tarantino's best 2000 film, but after a recent rewatch , I'm reconsidering.  Both films were good.  Don't get me wrong, but Django is in need of a rewatch.  However, Inglorious Basterds is Tarantino at his best.\n\nSet in the 1940s, this World War 2 epic follows Lt. Aldo Raine as the leader of a ragtag group of soldiers sent to kill any Nazi, along with Hitler himself.  Meanwhile, a Jewish woman, who lost her family to Nazi soldiers, has set a trap.  She poses as the owner of a theater, which will premiere one of the supposedly best films ever.  Of course, Mr. Hitler will be in attendance.  Many plots are interwoven, including one about German soldier Hans Landa, who is much smarter than he appears.  The film has a different premise than his other films, but don't get that wrong.  It still has that Tarantino feel to it, so if you're not a fan of Pulp Fiction, Resevoir Dogs, or Kill Bill, stay away.  However, this a must see for Tarantino fans cause I will tell you this: It's one of his best works to date.\n\nThe best thing this film has going for it is Tarantino's script without a doubt.  If you're not a fan of dialogue driven films, you'll leave this film wanting more.  Much of the film is comedic, which can be interpreted wrong at times.  Sometimes the comedy seemed to happen at the wrong time, making it seem as if every German soldier deserved to die.  This is my biggest complaint for the film because it makes it seem as if all German soldiers supported the Nazi regime.  It's inaccurate, and many Germans may feel it's distasteful.  I kind of do, but I can't help but say that it boosts the film.  Of course, this film features Tarantino's style of violence.  Outrageous amounts of blood spill and some deaths are very brutal, namely the introduction to the Bear Jew (played by Eli Roth).  It's violence actually helps the film, however.  It gives it a very realistic feel reminding us that WW2 was a brutal fight.  While doing this, Tarantino also entertains un in his own special way.\n\nAlso, I can't review this film without mentioning Christoph Waltz' Hans Landa.  This guy is truly amazing.  Every scene he's in is completely amazing.  His character is one of the best villains ever.  He lifts this film above average territory straight into amazing.  The opening scene in which he haunts down a Jewish family reveals everything about him.  I love a film where I can understand a character based off of one scene.  I understood that Landa was a much smarter soldier, who only cares for his own well being.  He's ruthless and cold.  It truly is amazing.. Tarantino made a really amazing character.  However, I wasn't fond of Pitt's performance in this film.  He was used more as the comic relief, and while it was funny at times, he gets annoying after a while.  I really felt like he really  didn't add anything to the film.\n\nOverall, Inglorious Basterds is a pretty good film.  Definitely one of Tarantino's best written films right now.  It features some intense scenes and some pretty crazy shootouts.  Sure, the violence maybe a little too gratuitous, but it lets be honest here.  Nobody does violence better than Tarantino.  Some would complain about the very distasteful portrayal of all German soldiers because most didn't support the Third Reich.  However, I loved this film, mainly cause of the grand scale of things.  Rather than feel  like a small time robbery like most of Tarantino's films, it feels more epic in it's scope, which really gives a vibe unmatched by his other films.  Of course the film is weighed down by the comedy, which really wasn't bad, but it felt unnecessary in some moments.  However, I believe this was Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction.  And I believe Tarantino thinks the same way.  In the end, a character says, \"You know.  This might just be my masterpiece.\"  Is that Tarantino telling us something?  I think so.",

Inglourious Basterds is his 6th film and it shows Tarantino going back to the things that made his film great whilst doing something unique.\n\nInglourious Basterds is written by Quentin Tarantino, and he has rewritten history with this film. In doing that, it does run the line of controversy as people may think of his vision or retelling as ridiculous or pompous. I never saw it that way, because I never gave this film the seriousness that I usually would give to a film like Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, instead I came into this looking for some fun and that is definitely what I got. Tarantino here has brought back the non-linear approach to his storytelling. He dedicates the first three chapters of the film as an introduction to the key players of the last chapter, and having the 4th Chapter 'Operation Kino' as the driving plot point. Tarantino has avoided his first three chapters to repeat themselves and telling us what we already know, instead it dedicates each one solely to it's characters and nothing else. It kept me hooked because with each chapter, he adds on more information that we didn't know which builds it all up for the last two chapters of the film. Tarantino has played around with history in this film, which is definitely a first for him, and he would later do this for Django, but not to the degree of change and impact that this film demonstrates. The film shows off entertaining and quirky characters, which hasn't been found in his films since his 90's flicks. Tarantino has given his characters much more depth here than most of his previous films would give, and he continuous it with his next film, and it does allow me to connect with these characters more and understand their inner workings due to their given back-stories. The dialogue in this film is top notch, at times very reminiscent of the style that was used for Pulp Fiction, as it kept me more interested as more words come out from these characters. Tarantino was also able to add in for his characters, the knowledge he has on film of that era which I thought was a nice touch. To some people, they may see it as a return to Tarantino's indulgent style of dialogue but that's what makes his films special in the first place, so the more the better.\n\nNot at all did the film bore me, this is because Tarantino is in love with his own dialogue and he makes it the star of the scene. Tarantino fills the scene with dialogue, as a build up of sorts towards the violent and explosive ending that the scene needs in order to be relieved and pumped for what comes next. As I said before the non-linear storytelling of the film and using the bulk of the film to create and introduce it's characters, it doesn't get boring as it doesn't repeat itself and always give off something new. Some people find a lot of Tarantino's films to have a pacing problem and I can understand where they are coming from, but Inglourious Basterds is one of those films that felt like it moves forwards all the time regardless how still a scene may seem because it keeps throwing interesting things your way and in a lot of scenes, Tarantino was able to convey tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat thinking something might happen. Ultimately, Tarantino is just making a revenge film set in the era of World War 2, and people may complain that it lacks a bit of substance and never asks any questions about morality and doesn't put the Germans, or the Americans for that matter based on the method of their killings, trial for their actions. I don't really think it needed that because, that's not what this film is meant to be, this is supposed to be just a fun revenge flick. Tarantino has used non-English dialogue with subtitles in his previous films, Kill Bill, and now he has put that up front with this film, using it as a style in making this film unique and allowing the film to feel more genuine.\n\nRobert Richardson is back to do another of Tarantino's film and with each film I start to see a connection and understanding of each other's visions. Richardson understands what the film needs to create that homage atmosphere that Tarantino intends his films to look like. Richardson and Tarantino has brought back their trademark shots like long takes and the trunk shot. Because this film is a dialogue driven film, Richardson contains a lot more closeups than his previous films and this does allow us to get in touch with these characters and see the emotional rumblings that they hide behind the facade due to the current situation, especially Melanie Laurent's character. As time gone by, Tarantino's vision has gotten bigger with scripts that are very ambitious and an increase in budget, this allows the characters to be not too confined in a certain space and allowing the film to have multiple and a variation in locations to shoot. The film's photography seems to strip away the over saturation of it's colors, like Kill Bill and Death Proof, and takes a more darker and grimier look for the film.\n\nThe film doesn't contain a composer writing an original score, instead it uses soundtracks that are more score driven. The tracks that are chosen are Sergio Leone/Ennio Morricone inspired, which on paper would be an odd choice as it suits more of the Western era but after seeing this film, you hardly even notice it and at the end you realize that it actually works. There are specific moments that are supported by a track that makes the moment seem perfect but Tarantino has the habit of cutting it off and not giving the scene a proper conclusion, which gives off a comedic feel and prevents it from being too melodramatic.\n\nBrad Pitt may be seen as the frontrunner of the film but the film is more of an ensemble piece. The first three chapters are dedicated to a certain character(s), and this allows these actor(s) to shine in their segments. Brad Pitt definitely brings a surge of energy in this film, working with a character that feels almost specifically written for him. The other standout was Christoph Waltz, playing a character that has a personality that I have haven't seen before. Waltz brings such charm and personality to a character that is regarded by most people as the ultimate Jew killer. The Supporting Actor win at the Oscars for Waltz was definitely deserving. Tarantino has used an international cast before but not as diverse as this film. Inglourious Basterds has made a star and showcased the talents of actors like Melanie Laurent and Daniel Bruhl. Though Michael Fassbender has been on films before this like 300 but this film put him on the map, the bar scene segment was tense and thrilling and a part of it is due to Fassbender's performance.\n\nInglourious Basterds is a remarkable film and a demonstration of Tarantino's ability to take something that has been used a billion times in films and make it feel fresh and unique. The film boasts wonderful dialogue, amazing sequences, fantastic performances front actors, smart choice of music, and excellent photography. Inglourious Basterds is a rival for the number one spot for my favorite Tarantino films.",

To top this off, Christoph Waltz is backed up with Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Michael Fassbender (Prometheus) and even Director Eli Roth (Hostel).

I'll happily admit that he's one of the freshest, most original modern directors, out there.  But look, I know it's prudish, but I just can't understand his almost sexual infatuation with violence.  Films like 'Kill Bill' just make me sick, because while I might be called an ignorant fool in criticising it, I just think that its only claim to creativity is in how much blood it can splatter over the screen.  And despite what he keeps adamantly repeating, glorified violence in films does serve as influence to violence in real life.  But I'll keep this short.  I could write an entire essay over how I feel over this subject, but this review is on 'Inglourious Basterds'.  Okay, so I can see where this movie is coming from, in that it aims to fantasize over what might have happened if Hitler got his shit handed to him when he really deserved it.  The movie is an artistical masterpiece, and as usual, the actors deliver very solid performances.  There are certain moments in this film that are worthy of nothing but silent admiration - the opening scene being one of the tensest things the man has ever filmed.  But on the whole, it's still a downright mean-spirited fantasy about people hurting people.  I suppose it also didn't help that Bryan Singer's much more sympathetic depiction of the Nazis ('Valkyrie') came out so close to this one.",

As expected, the script and dialogue is phenomenal, heavy, but extraordinarily good. The characters he writes are incredible to watch on screen, and he yet again casts beautifully. However, what stops Basterds from being up their will Pulp Fiction is that the segments that the film is split into, doesn't quite fit together as sweetly as Pulp Fiction did. This film feels more like a bunch of sequences just placed together rather than one individual film, whereas with Pulp, although split into different stories, the sequences fit together so nicely that it worked brilliantly.\n\nAs with all Quentin Tarantino, the actors chosen are sublime with the stand-out performance going to Christoph Waltz. Waltz's Hans Landa takes evil to a new level as he interrogates his victim with such confidence, such calmness, that he provokes fear from his reputation and ruthlessness. Landa's personality oozes charm with a straight shooting malice (in four language) that is just outstanding to watch. Hugely deserving of the Oscar for best supporting actor and the making of this film.\n\nFor any die-hard QT fan this film will not disappoint. Will it polarize the audience? Possibly.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n8/10.",

In fact, I'll go so far as to say that it's my favorite Tarantino flick, though not quite as quotable as Pulp Fiction.  The problem, as I'll get into, lies in how the movie was advertised.\nDoes this movie tell a complete story?  Yes.  It has a definite beginning, definite end, good pacing, and leaves very few questions hanging, which in this movie, is a good thing.  One star.\nAre the effects and acting believable?  Not much in the way of super special effects needed for this movie besides blood, explosions, and gunshots, and they're all done perfectly.  The acting is spot-on.  Pitt plays a crazy but sensible Lt. Raine.  Waltz even won an Oscar for his role as Col. Hans Landa.  One star.\nDoes this movie avoid clich\u00e9?  In all the ways that matter, yes.  A few are played on for humor purposes, but it's not anywhere near bad enough to warrant not giving a whole star.  Even if it was, the unarguably un-clich\u00e9 ending would be enough to cancel it all.  One star.\nDoes this movie do what it set out to do? Yes, but only to a point.  This movie was advertised in theaters and on TV as being a hardcore gritty WWII action flick.  While the hardcore and gritty (and WWII, thankfully) parts are down-pat, this is not an action movie, and a lot of people may be turned off if they're expecting WWII Die Hard and get something closer to The 39 Steps.  This is a thriller movie, with lots of dialogue, tension, and suspense, and it does that to a \"T\", but it loses half a star for bad advertising.  1/2 star.\nDoes this movie have a takeaway?  *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* Well, yes, but rightfully so.  \"How are they building up to all this without finally killing Hitler?\" You may ask.  \"What's that about not killing Hitler?\" Tarantino replies, \"I can't hear you over the sound of me killing Hitler.\"  Tarantino boldly claims that he could have done WWII better than the actual people in charge did, and for that and changing history, it gets one star.\nFinal score: 4.5 stars.  This is my favorite movie right now and I highly recommend it to anybody who is a fan of a good story.",

Yeah, he's in this movie, and he does a legitimately good job.  Nice to see he wasn't completely doomed.  Perhaps he'll reappear in another good movie?

I think Tarantino in this film does a great job at manipulating the audience in a way, testing your morality. Landa, despite being a well Nazi there is an aspect of his character that is likable. Goebbels and Hitler are well goofy and funny despite being mass murderers. In the end scene, when the carnage against the Nazi's begins which is nasty and violent and horrific and really tests the audiences morality in a revenge setting. The end scene really makes you think about the good vs. evil narrative seen in film and in society. In the end, the contrast between the murderous and violent propaganda film the Nazi's cheer on as American soldiers die, and then American soldiers murdering and massacring Nazi's truly shows the true nature of war and morality and right and wrong in a magnificent way.

That one was the hardest R I'd ever seen, so I was a little worried about watching a war movie from the same writer/director. The best way to describe the sensation of watching is that it was like cutting off a bite of perfectly cooked steak and rolling it around in my mouth, savoring the flavor as long as possible.\n\nThe idea is that Brad Pitt's Basterds are going to try to end World War II with their Apache guerilla tactics, but the wrinkle is that Christoph Waltz's \"Jew hunter\" is their nemesis. Tarantino masterfully walks the tightrope of suspense throughout. Coming in, I'd thought this was an action flick (and this certainly has its share of that), but I'd label it more on the side of thriller; the whole thing is a series of will-he-or-won't-he moments, culminating in one of the gutsiest endings I've ever seen (itself a will-Tarantino-or-won't-he situation).\n\nThere's not much to dislike about Inglourious Basterds--except for the violence/gore (there's a bit of sex/language, but no more than any other soft R, I think). Between the scalping and the swastika carving on foreheads, this is not a movie for the faint of heart, children, or mothers. I found myself flinching a few times, thinking, \"we're supposed to be the good guys!\" Basterds, however, transcends that. It's a movie about stereotypes doing things they're not supposed to do: American, German, French, Jew, and Tarantino. I think that...not necessarily excuses, but explains most of what I reacted to.\n\nHowever, with that caveat of violence made known, I would encourage you to see Inglourious Basterds. The pacing is perfect, the suspense is brilliant, the characters are amazing, the tone is pitch-perfect, and the praise is gushing a little too freely. Just watch the movie already.",

Recheado do t\u00edpico humor \"tarantinesco\" e de incr\u00edveis di\u00e1logos espertos, que te faz se surpreender com cada fala recitada, o filme pode ser considerado n\u00e3o apenas como mais uma obra de Tarantino, mas sim como o melhor filme do diretor ap\u00f3s \"Pulp Fiction - Tempo de Viol\u00eancia\". Transformando a Segunda Guerra Mundial em uma deliciosa e super criativa aventura, o que Tarantino faz cruza as fronteiras e os limites estabelecidos por todos os filmes de nazismo at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o: para a f\u00e9rtil imagina\u00e7\u00e3o deste \u00fanico diretor, a Segunda Guerra Mundial acabaria dentro de um cinema, com a morte de centenas de nazista (E at\u00e9 mesmo do pr\u00f3prio Hitler!) realizadas pelas m\u00e3os de um grupo de judeus americanos e vingativos, liderados pelo Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, em uma divertid\u00edssima interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o!), que tem como o objetivo matar oficiais nazistas de forma b\u00e1rbara, para espalhar o medo e o pavor entre os seguidores do \"Fuhrer\".\nO longa segue uma estrutura estilosa (claro, como n\u00e3o falar de Tarantino sem se referir ao seu estilo \u00fanico!), que sendo dividida em atos, acabam fazendo com que algumas cenas fiquem um pouco longas (a cena do bar em que acontece o tiroteio, por exemplo, deve ter consumido mais de vinte minutos do filme). Ao contr\u00e1rio do que muitos podem pensar, a grande dura\u00e7\u00e3o destas cenas n\u00e3o transformam \"Bastardos Ingl\u00f3rios\" em um filme ma\u00e7ante, mas acabam fazendo com que os momentos de a\u00e7\u00e3o causem mais impacto e - tamb\u00e9m - permitem que o roteiro extremamente bem escrito (considero este o melhor roteiro do diretor deste 'Pulp Fiction') tenha mais tempo para mostrar o seu poder e sua compet\u00eancia.\nTarantino n\u00e3o apenas conseguiu escrever um roteiro perfeito, como tamb\u00e9m encontrou um ator desconhecido chamado Christoph Waltz (o famoso \"Ca\u00e7ador de Judeus\"). A sua interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o, que lhe rendeu o \u00d3scar de Melhor Ator Coadjuvante, \u00e9 um dos grandes pontos altos do filme! Waltz consegue, com a sua interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o cordial, educada, sarc\u00e1stica e assassina, dar vida ao General Hans Landa de uma forma que impressiona, conseguindo o transformar em um personagem amea\u00e7ador e assustador.\nE o final do filme - um dos grandes momentos de toda a carreira do Tarantino - \u00e9 algo que te deixa de queixo ca\u00eddo.  \u00d3bvio que pela exagerada viol\u00eancia e pela enorme quantidade de sangue, mas tamb\u00e9m com a imagina\u00e7\u00e3o sem limites que este diretor fabuloso t\u00eam. Para mim, um marco na hist\u00f3ria do cinema!",

Featuring an all-star cast that includes Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, Melanie Laurent, Michael Fassbender, Eli Roth and Diane Kruger, the performances are exceptionally good.  However, Tarantino's flare for dialog has trouble translating, and gets bogged down in minutia.  The film also has some pacing issues, and the storytelling's a bit weak.

            "content": "Before I review the movie I should address the topic that Tarantino chose for this one and my thoughts on it. \n\nIt does bother me somewhat using real historical times for bloodthirsty action movies and I was disappointed to see Tarantino go down that route, especially with WWII, it's far from imaginative. There are plenty of Tarantino movies that I love the violence in- near enough all of them because it is over the top popcorn action and it is our fictional hero getting revenge or whatever but when we are talking about Nazis who actually did these things to real people it just leaves me feeling queasy to see it exploited in film. War movies in general do little for me unless they are using the violence to convey the damage that comes from it or something similar and thankfully there's lots of war movies that do just that and the ones that don't generally aren't violent enough to bother me.  However this film is a pretty grim example and it is work like this that reminds me that Tarantino is indeed a prick.\n\nRegardless, a prick can still make good movies and this is one of them but it looses marks from me for the lazy and unashamed use of Nazis for bad guys and Jews for victims. Of course Tarantino turns it around and says \"No, we are killing the Nazis, it's revenge, it is totally fine\" or something like that but his film shows otherwise- the opening scene after all involves a Jewish family in hiding being shot to death from above by several Nazis. Now, sure, it gives us our bad guy and blah blah, but really as soon as we see a Nazi who takes pride in being called the 'Jew-hunter' he is already fully-established as evil, killing people after that is just getting off and I'm not willing to give Tarantino the benefit of the doubt with this one.\n\nThe worst thing though is just how unimaginative it is- I've never found imagination to be what Tarantino does best, he sticks to the same formula throughout his films, there's little themes that you couldn't easily find elsewhere and there's generally just a lot of shooting or whatever. This is fine though because he has other strengths but by using events like WWII he is weakening his strong points by further showing his lack of imagination. Umm, has he done cowboys and Indians yet?\n\nSo that's where I lie with the subject matter but actually, despite my disappointment with it, it is only one element of the film and some of the others on show are displays of Tarantino at his best.\n\nDialogue-wise this is my favourite of his, it's very hit and miss as always but you can feel the care that went into it and some scenes really benefit from it. It's not quirky as in Reservoir Dogs nor as fun as in Pulp Fiction but it's more interesting than with the likes of Kill Bill and Jackie Brown and it adds more to specific scenes than it ever did in his other films. (okay, maybe in Pulp Fiction too.)\n\nThe characters were kind of disappointing inn this one- they just didn't capture my attention too much, Raine in particular was just Brad Pitt getting paid to be annoying for me. The story overall has enough of what I expect from Tarantino but it still isn't as strong as his' previous work. \n\nThe real strength in this one is Tarantino's ability to create memorable scenes, ones that hang around in your mind long after you've forgotten most of what happens in the film. There are several great scenes like that in here- the opening scene for example is brilliant. (aside from killing the family- the same impact could have been made had it just been hinted at rather than getting off on showing it)\n\nIt's well-written, looks great, has tension, is superbly acted- it really is a brilliant opening scene. Scenes like that are Tarantino's talent and when there's enough of them they make for a great movie- here we have some great moments in an overall below-par show for Tarantino however it still has some of the other touches that make a Tarantino film work (though many of these are old now) and it is by no means a bad film. More importantly, it isn't a movie that should be analysed in the way that I've tried to do, it is simply one that should be watched to pass the time and in that way, this is surely a good film.",

            "content": "My first encounter with Quentin Tarantino's film was not that romantic and smooth. I was curious about his films because so many people praise him and treat him (and his films) like cults. So I bought Pulp Fiction (1994) and watched it when I was around 16. I ended up not understanding the film; I enjoyed some parts of it, but at that time it just didn't make any sense to me. So when Inglourious Basterds was released and nominated for so many awards, I wasn't really eager to watch it, worrying that I would end up not understanding the film; I haven't reached the 'level' of understanding, enjoying and appreciating his films yet.\nUntil last night. \nRight now I'm fangirling (again) over Ben Whishaw and Michael Fassbender. So I browsed Michael Fassbender films and found out that he actually appeared in Inglourious Basterds. I had the film laying down quietly in my hard disk for ages and I hadn't watched it, so I decided to watch. I'm not really sure at first, but I kept watching the opening credit (quite classic), then to the opening scene. It was already 2 am but I just couldn't stop watching it. The way he directed it was so cool and interesting that it made me curious and hungry about what would happen in the next scenes. Wonderful atmosphere.\nI kept waiting for Michael Fassbender to appear. He finally appeared in the middle of the film. I thought he was going to play a German role, instead he played an English role. (Oh my God, he's just so...) \nThis is ultimately not the film that will be my first choice or whatever, due to the violence in it, but I have to say that this film is quite something. It's different and unique, especially the way Tarantino captured the scenes. He loves long shots (and they're brilliant), peculiar-angle shots and dividing his films into some chapters. My ultimate favourite scene is when they're down in the tavern. I think it was so great. \nChristoph Waltz's performance was excellent! Hands down. Unfortunately, Brad Pitt's performance was somewhat appears weird to me, seems unnatural.\n(Spoiler Alert!)\nSuch a creative idea to make a film about alternate history (ending) of World War II. I like the way Hitler died, the ending of World War II, all collided with films, with cinema. We know that Hitler also used films as his propaganda. He said that if you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed. As we can see in this film, the man of his propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, accompany him in the viewing of the film. My lecturer in class told me that Hitler's favourite director, Leni Riefenstahl, made a film for him in 1934 called Triumph des Willens. I haven't seen the film yet, but it is said that the film had successfully build Hitler's might and right despite his weaknesses (for example, he's not that high and mighty in terms of his height).",

They just have scenes that go on for a long time He also made it seem like there were several different stories, and there were, but they were in order. The film had different chapters like his films like Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill has. That is how they make it seem like there are multiple story lines. It was a classic Tarantino film for that reason.\n\nAlso like all of Quentin Tarantino films the acting is really good. His screenplays are so well written that it allows actors like Brad Pitt, and Christoph Waltz to show their skills as actors. I think that if you are an actor with talent it is hard not to be really good in his films, because of how good his directing, and screenwriting is. Something about the way he works just allows actors to be awesome in his movies. It is part of the reason why Quentin Tarantino is my favorite director. In interviews for his films I find it obvious that actors in his films just love working with him, and love what he does. I feel like true film buffs, and actors will love his films especially. The more and more I have gotten into films the more and more I have grown to love Quentin Tarantino. This is a film that also got better and better for me. First time I saw it I gave it an 8.5/10 and now it is a 10/10. Just an amazing and classic Tarantino film.\n\nHowever it was a very different one for him, because of the topic. This is the first time that he touched a topic that had importance on the world. All of his films before were just really interesting and well done stylized films. In this film he did a very historically inaccurate version of the holocaust. We all know what happened in the holocaust, but this film in my opinion is the way that a lot of people wish that the holocaust really happened. The idea of a group known as \"The Basterds\" going around killing Nazi's, and getting revenge on them for starting the holocaust sounds better then a bunch of Nazi's killing millions of Jews in a few years in my opinion. I feel like this is how Tarantino really wished the holocaust happened. I felt like he probably felt like the holocaust could have ended so much quicker if what happened in this film really did happen. They ended the war in a way that seemed so much simpler then the way it really happened. When you think about it was way simpler, and it ended way better in the movie in my opinion. I think certain people may like this movie because of that. I liked it because of that. It kind of gave me a perspective on how the holocaust could have happened, and I liked that perspective that Quentin Tarantino gave me a lot.\n\nI find that he takes everything to the next level with his films. He takes violence, brutality, acting, and dialogue to the next level, but he also takes awesomeness to the next level. He really did that for me with this film. Really the only Tarantino film that didn't blow me away was \"Death Proof.\" That is a really bad Tarantino film, and I felt like he was going through some severe writers block when he did that, but he got his genius back to write \"Inglourious Basterds.\" This was one of his ingenious films for sure. This film really took all aspects of cinema that make movies awesome, and he took it to the next level, and then some. That is the reason why I gave this film a 10/10.\n\nNow what actually happened in this film is that there is a group of Jewish men known as \"The Basterds\" going around killing Nazi's. It is lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) an American from Tennessee. He gives his men a goal of killing one hundred Nazi's, and to bring back one hundred Nazi scalps. They become known and hated by Nazi's around Germany, and Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke). In one scene they kill a bunch of Nazi's but they let one go. They let the one go who told them the information they wanted. However when they let a Nazi live Aldo gives them \"Something that they won't be able to take off.\" What that thing that they won't be able to take off is specifically is a Swastika carved into their forehead. Aldo did that to the guy he let go in that scene, and he told him, that you need to tell them that we let you go so you can spread fear about us, and not because you gave us information so you won't get shot. Also when somebody dies for their country and refuses to help them Sgt. Donnie Donowitz (Eli Roth) also know as \"The Bear Jew\" kills that person by beating them to death with a bat. That is the introduction to The Basterds, and what the concept of what they do is. That part of the story is the violent side that sets up the suspense for how later on they will get their revenge on the Nazi's and end the war.\n\nIn the opening scene Col. Hans (Christoph waltz) also known as \"The Jew Hunter\" massacres a Jewish family hiding below Perrier LaPadite's (Denis Menochet) house, but one girl named Shosanna (M\u00e9lanie Laurent) gets away. She later goes on to own a movie theater, and that is the 2nd part of the story. That part also helps set up the suspense, and it really helps add a different background to the story. This film brings these two different story lines, and tells them in chronological order, and as the film goes on they are brought together beautifully.\n\nThe film gave an amazing perspective on slavery, and I loved every minute. It was just another film that made me grateful to be a movie buff, and to be a Tarantino fan. He is my favorite director, and I will always look to his work for inspiration when I try to pursue my dream of being a film director. The only thing with this film is that all the different languages, and the fact that you have to read it makes it hard to follow after a while. That is why I liked it so much more the 2nd time. Other then that part of the film it was so epic, and it was beautifully done. It gave a different perspective on a really controversial topic, and it gave that perspective beautifully.\n\nHowever that perspective may upset people, because some people may be mad that he didn't tell the holocaust they way it was. He told it the way he wish it really happened instead of how it really happened. Some may think that he should not have done that, but I agree with what he did, because it was an interesting idea that he did. A film where Jews are killing Nazi's during the holocaust and getting their revenge on them has not been done before, and I feel like it was a good thing to do. I could never criticize Quentin Tarantino for what he does, because it takes courage to tackle topics like this, weather you are giving a new perspective on it, or of you are telling it the way it really was. This is an amazing movie, and I really hope that most people agree with the way I feel about what I think that Tarantino was trying to do with it.",

He is pretty much the comedy relief in this film which is a neat trick to pull off since whenever he is on screen, someone was probably getting killed, or about to be killed.\r\n\r\nAlso good to see BJ Novak from The Office in a big film even though he was mostly in the background until the end.",

With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the \"Basterds\", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.\n\nSince I had to sit down a watch this movie for the first real time, I can honestly say this could me my all time favorite Quentin Tarantino film of all time. I know it may be a recent movie, but its just the perfect style of film done by one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived. Only Tarantino could make something awesome as this. What ever you would expect going, your gonna get high expectations. Its funny, dark, violent and hands down one of Tarantino's most brilliant work. It's one of those movies that when your watching it, you get the chills. The story is so remarkable, and so well written that the pacing is just out of this world.\n \nOne thing about every Tarantino film, is that the cast is just outstanding. Brad Pitt is an all out bad ass. He's smooth, charming and a fancy dancy dude. Christoph Waltz has never let me down while on the big screen, and every time I see him he seems to get better and better. I want to mention a few things about Eli Roth. His character is just a gritty, dark and spine tingling person, and I couldn't be more thrilled to say I loved him in this movie. Like I've said before, Tarantino is a tremendous director/writer and he knows what the viewers want to see. \n\nNot only is this one of Tarantino's best films, but it's also one of my favorite movies. QT is in my top 5 of filmmakers because he's such an intelligent director that he takes his own thoughts and ideas and puts them in his movies. QT your my boy and please keep up the good work.",

It is constantly changing setting and focus, but yet retains enough of a coherent plot to pull the whole movie together in the end. It's overall themes, as I see it, are that of revenge, finishing a job, and arrogance.\n\nActing/Script: The entire cast does a beautiful job of bringing their characters to life (especially Mr. Waltz) and the conversations are engaging enough to hold your attention completely even when not much is happening on screen. There are some especially hilarious moments to be had with many of Brad Pitt's lines. Zoller's character is also a gripping way to help relate the Nazi's back to the audience, as a way of reminding them there were individual people among their ranks, and they all weren't the same.\n\nSoundtrack: Eclectic, but always fitting for their scenes. The music really does match what they are set to, and are used to really contrast several scenes' tones against each other.\n\nVisuals: As this is a Tarantino movie, you can expect a lot of tabletop shots, shots done to imitate other movies' styles,  and an almost gratuitous amount of blood. Quentin Tarantino paints with a red brush, but does so with master strokes, making it seem more like art than unnecessary violence. \n\nOverall: I'd say go see it, but your probably already have. It is an interesting piece of historical-fiction, and keeps you entertained and gripped throughout. The best way to describe it is as a comic book version of a WW2 historical fiction brought to the big screen. 4.5/5",

            "content": "It is really known that when you see a movie by Quentin Tarantino, you are in for a movie experience like any other. The man who brought us Kill Bill, Django Unchained, and Pulp Fiction brings Inglorious Bastards. I expected really slick dialogue and a lot of action. I tried to enjoy this movie, I really did, but with the English subtitles taking me out of the story, the conversations and characters I don't really care about, and the little action, Tarantino swung and missed with this movie. Inglorious was his worst movie since Kill Bill 2.\nBrad Pitt stars, I guess he stars since he is in the movie so little, as a leader of the Inglorious Bastards. The Bastards hunt down and kill Nazis. When Pitt is on screen he is entertaining and he did a good job acting, but I wanted to see him more. It takes a long time to introduce his character and we don't see him all that much. Instead, the movie focuses on many characters and it is almost confusing to remember who is who. There was also the Jewish girl who escapes, the members of the inglorious bastards, a few key Nazis including Hitler, the random lady who I don't even know the name of, and then there is the Nazi General played by Christoph Waltz.\nWaltz is the only reason I didn't hate the movie. He saved the movie for me. He won an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role and for most of the movie I was trying to figure out why. He shows up a lot in the beginning speaking back and forth from English, French, and German, but his conversations are just boring. Pulp Fiction had conversations about milkshakes and it was way more interesting than any conversation in Inglorious Bastards. By the end his characters actions and a really intense scene between Waltz and Pitt really sucked me in and did save the movie for me. I was waiting for something to happen and there were flashes of brilliance in the movie but overall it was disappointing.\nThe strongest point to a Tarantino movie is the dialogue along with some intense action scenes. This movie had very few of both. The very first scene of a movie is very important. Star Wars had Darth Vader's introduction. Lord of the Rings had the seven minute prologue. Pulp Fiction had the incredible conversation in the diner. This movie had nothing. I was uninterested from the very beginning. It is Waltz and a French farmer talking about nonsense and after almost ten minutes of pointless talk it gets interesting. The Frenchman was hiding Jews under the floorboards and the last minute or two of the opening scene had such a little impact because of the boring conversation. It didn't work for me.\nA lot of people didn't like that most of the movie wasn't in English and that it was subtitled. Now, I love subtitles. Even when a movie is 100%in English I put on subtitles. It is just a habit so subtitles didn't bother me. However, the subtitles took me out of the experience and I'm not too sure why. It made it difficult for me to connect or care with any of the characters. I got a few characters confused and a lot of them were just unimportant. There was a long scene in a bar and again, it had a good ending to the scene but the events leading up to it dragged on and on.\nThis movie isn't suppose to be historically accurate, but this makes zero sense. The basic idea of the movie is to get a large group of Nazi leaders in a movie theatre to present a German war movie, and kill them all. It is the act of a Jew to get revenge on the Nazis with the help of Brad Pitt and the bastards. First off, Nazi leaders would never put all of their leaders in the same room, or at least they would premier in Germany and not France. Trying to sell this idea is completely crazy and you know this would never ever be possible. The ending scenes were amusing and fun to watch, as unrealistic as they were I still laughed. The final scene of the movie was terrible because I was asking myself \"That's it? What happens next? That was dumb.\" The story wasn't finished. I feel like it was laziness by Tarantino which was unexpected.\nWas this movie a disaster? No, when there were action scenes they were really awesome. A huge Jew beats the skull in of a German officer and how do you not enjoy the sight of a Nazi getting demolished by a Jew? Pitt had a lot of smart dialogue and I loved his accent. The confrontation between him and Waltz was great, but it could have been so much better. This entire movie can really be summed up in a word, disappointment.\nOverall, Inglorious Bastards was not Tarantino's best, but it was not his worst either. I remember seeing trailers for this movie and I thought it looked stupid and I was uninterested. I then learned who Tarantino was and saw his movie and I needed to see this movie. I saw this movie because of its director but I didn't feel like I was watching one of his movies. I didn't know what I was watching but out of respect for the director I finished the movie and salvaged what I could. I did my best to enjoy this movie but it gets the WillyT A for Effort.",

Some chapters were great, some less, but the different plots soon start to converge when the various characters start appearing together in the same chapters. Cool ensemble! Michael Fassbender was subtly superb, and that scene in the bar around the table was so horrendously nail-biting that i stood up grasping my pillow, LOL! Christoph Waltz was magnificent, speaking German, French, English and even Italian to blow poor Brad Pitt's cover!

I don't see films use language as much as this film does. So yeah, the language is a huge part of this movie, but as far as tensity goes, good God. Like, seriously, every scene creates at atmosphere of building suspense as you wonder \"what they Hell is going to happen?!\", and it works oh so well. Really, the film is full of a bunch of these tense scenes, and just combines them all, and I mean that in a really good way. Yes, there are some \"fun\" scenes to be found here, but they are few and far between. The dialogue is so extremely important in an amazing project by Quentin Tarantino. As for the acting, one cannot talk about this film without talking about two people, Brad Pitt, who is really good here, and Christoph Waltz, playing a cold-hearted bastard (no pun intended, I swear to God) of a character, who you loathe, but cannot be anything less than astounded by, because his motives are so interesting, going beyond just a Nazi who hates the Jews because he is a Nazi. Also, this film carries the distinct honor of having a spectacular final 30-45 minutes. There are about two or three plots going on in this film, and all of them are well established and interesting, and they all connect by the end, and it is just a fantastic screenplay by Tarantino, whose screenplays are always revered, and with very good reason. Overall, this is one of Tarantino's best, and definitely stands out as his most dense film to date, taking a vastly more serious approach (not to say that Tarantino is never serious, but just that this film is far more so than any other in my opinion), and is a must-watch for any Tarantino fan, though they likely already have.",

Not really since all of his movies are tough to compare, but it's really great for his first take on a period piece. Edit: I left the star rating the same, but this edit comes after several additional viewings. I have a somewhat change of heart, mainly morally. I think a lot of the language is harsh, like any Tarantino film. Mostly it is \"acceptable\" because of the characters using them, but I still don't appreciate so much blasphemy. The very brief sex-scene is so unnecessary, I really wish he would have replaced it with something else, or completely removed it... and I just watched the trailer and see that it is very misleading haha. So much less action than talking, and the trailer shows the opposite.",

Christoph Waltz is utterly brilliant, but his character's resolution is not altogether satisfying (Plus it leads to the final grandiose line of the film, a meta joke that seems a tad too vain even for Tarantino). Michael Fassbender's brief but impactful appearance as an undercover British agent is a highlight, and what transpires in the basement bar is one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in some time. The tale of Melanie Laurent's Shoshanna is also rather moving, even if I'm not exactly sure what Tarantino has to say about her (Or really, any of the other characters) in the end. \n\nThis is a strange and often confused film, but it's expertly crafted and probably a lot more fun than it oughta be.",

Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and his group of 'basterds' as they invade Nazi-occupied France with the mission to claim Nazi scalps. The basterds team up with German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) when they learn that the Nazis will be attending the French premiere of \"The Nation's Pride,\" a German propaganda film based on the heroic tale of Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Br\u00fchl). The Basterds hatch an explosive plan to use the premiere to wipe out as many Nazis as they possibly can; yet with diabolical Col. Hans 'Jew Hunter' Landa (Christoph Waltz) on their case, would the plan go off as expected. (no pun intended).\n\nTarantino yet again does a film the way he wants to, and with Inglourious Basterds he writes his own history. As expected, the script and dialogue is phenomenal, heavy, but extraordinarily good. The characters he writes are incredible to watch on screen, and he yet again casts beautifully. However, what stops Basterds from being up their will Pulp Fiction is that the segments that the film is split into, doesn't quite fit together as sweetly as Pulp Fiction did. This film feels more like a bunch of sequences just placed together rather than one individual film, whereas with Pulp, although split into different stories, the sequences fit together so nicely that it worked brilliantly.\n\nAs with all Quentin Tarantino, the actors chosen are sublime with the stand-out performance going to Christoph Waltz. Waltz's Hans Landa takes evil to a new level as he interrogates his victim with such confidence, such calmness, that he provokes fear from his reputation and ruthlessness. Landa's personality oozes charm with a straight shooting malice (in four language) that is just outstanding to watch. Hugely deserving of the Oscar for best supporting actor and the making of this film.\n\nFor any die-hard QT fan this film will not disappoint. Will it polarize the audience? Possibly.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n8/10.",

But the film not only focuses attention on this group, but in many unforgettable characters that we see throughout the film, no one is less important than the other, all with their own characteristics. Throughout the film we see many moments of long dialogues, intriguing ones that hold your attention, and others that are interesting but sometimes they are just a little boring, but this dosen't ruin the movie at all. And also in the movie we have several times when violence explodes on the screen, moments that you was not even expecting.\nThe entire cast is phenomenal, with unforgettable characters. The film is interesting in that, as I said before, there are several characters of different nationalities. For example, who is German only speaks German, who is French only speaks French, who is English or American only speaks English. Crhistoph Waltz in my opinion was the best of all the characters, he's a cold heart nazi bastard, but at the same time is so much polight and intelligent, and he's the only character who speaks all languages ??present in the film. Not only it gives an unforgettable performance, but also Brad Pitt, M\u00e9lanie Laurent, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, and Diane Kruger, and soo many others that make's the movie.\nFull of violence; a lot of fun; intriguing dialogues every time, Tarantino delivers another classic to his movie list!",

            "content": "Inglourious Basterds - As a multi-equilibrium and frequently non-linear piece, complete with an array of influences and film references within itself, Inglourius Basterds is a welcome addition to the Tarantino collection.\n\nIn a visionary re-imagining of World War II history, the film takes place in Nazi-occupied France, where a group of American undercover soldiers called the \"Basterds\" hunt out Nazis and kill them as brutally as they can, sending the Nazi leaders a message about the Jewish resistance and about their impending doom. These soldiers are led by LT. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). While they go about their mission, the Nazis have appointed a merciless, cold-minded and calculating detective, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) to hunt down Jews hidden across France. Shosanna (M\u00e9lanie Laurent) narrowly avoided being killed by him as he massacred her entire family, and a few years later she got a new identity as a movie theater owner. She meets a handsome war hero (Daniel Bruhl), who's also a Nazi, and the Germans made an important movie about his battle feats; he is attracted by Shosanna and wants to move the premier of his film over to her theater, which makes Col. Hans Landa get involved in security issues with the theater and which makes the Basterds start concocting a plan on how to bust the Nazi-populated event.\n\n\"Inglourious Basterds\" may well be regarded as Tarantino's most brutal film, with detailed scenes of scalping, carving, clubbing etc. (though I personally still regard \"Reservoir Dogs\" as his most violent work). \"Basterds\" is a brutal film, at times, but personally, I also regard \"Inglourious Basterds\" as his funniest film. I almost died laughing at some points in the film - which includes a wide range of Tarantinoesque humor, some of it actually very subtle. A scene in which Aldo Raine claims to be Italian is just one example of many incredibly hilarious moments. I was amazed that primary Nazi villains such as Hitler and Goebbles were shown with a quite human side rather than one-dimensional monsters - which, of course makes them even more monstrous in any thinking person's mind. Hitler himself seems like a babbling and pathetic idiot. No doubt that some people will find this offensive. \n\nI'm not sure if this is Tarantino's masterpiece as he himself claims to be, but it's surely his most meaningful work. The story presents us with an alternate WWII setting in which the war is fought by way of movies that established national identity. The main villain of the film, and also the best character QT has ever written, is Hans Landa, a.k.a. the Jew Hunter. Almost at the end of the film we find out that he's a double-crosser, and I think that's the element that sets him on a lower moral scale than the other characters. He's not proud of his lineage or country - he's a professional detective and merciless killer who fights only for himself.\n\nOther levels of meaning relate to the way in which language works, either to communicate or to break communication. In the opening scene, which borrows shots literally from Lee Van Cleef's introduction in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", the Jew Hunter challenges our perception of language in Hollywood movies by specifically shifting gears halfway through the conversation in order to get to his objective. Later on, the culture clash and the ignorance of other people's languages become deadly important for our undercover heroes. QT seems to argue that it's that very same cultural racism (for lack of a better expression) that causes the atrocities of war in the very first place.\n\nFor a film so colorfully ostentatious, Basterds is a film imbued with great amounts of depth and subtlety. Essentially, this is a film about the audience. We see Hitler laugh hysterically at the Americans being slaughtered in the film-within-a-film Nation's Pride, and our natural instinct is repulsion - but it quickly dawns upon us that laughing at nasty, painful death is exactly how we've spent the last two hours. Having the twentieth century's ultimate figure of evil indulging in the same edgy delights as our good selves might send a ripple of unease over an audience which laughed heartily at the Bear Jew (a surprisingly accomplished Eli Roth) clobber a Nazi soldier to death whilst yelling baseball conventions. Just like Roth's own Hostel, we find ourselves forced to question why we find the violence so entertaining.\n\nThe movie is rich in characters, and boy are there a lot of them with quite a bit of screen time. Brad Pitt is definitely the main character of the Americans, and he gives an over the top, often times comedic performance. Diane Kruger plays a rather minor, but interesting role as a German movie star who is actually a spy for the Americans. Every role played is played well, but unlike as it would seem by the trailers, all these actors aren't wrapped around Brad Pitt's finger, but instead Christoph Waltz's. \n\nTarantino provides us with an absolutely menacing presence with Hans Landa, a German colonel who appears in the opening scenes in a manner akin to Angel Eyes in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (this is surely intentional, of course), only his evil is the smiling, chilling kind that reminds one of a William S. Buroughs line: the face of evil is the face of total need. Landa needs information, constantly, and asks so questioningly and with such cunning that we feel a sense of uncommon dread when he appears on screen, even when its just to eat a pastry with the (incognito) Shosanna. Take your eyes off this guy, I dare you. He's about as hypnotic and alluring and subtle as they come, and can floor you like Samuel L. Jackson reciting a Bible quote.\n\nThe film is magnificently shot and the settings are perfect. Apart from a magnificent intuition for general European and American cultural details, Tarantino once again pays tribute to countless cinematic idols. The film, which owes its title to Enzo Castellari's WW2-Exploitation classic \"Quel Maldetto Treno Blindato\" (\"Inglorious Bastards\", 1978) was originally said to be a sort of remake of Robert Aldrich's \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). It is not a remake of either film, but it alludes to both of them, Castellari even has a cameo as a Nazi. Apart from obvious referrals to German pre-war cinema, many cinema figures are alluded to. As a huge fan of Italian Horror films, I was delighted to hear Eli Roth use the pseudonym \"Antonio Margheriti\" (Like Antonio Margheriti, the magnificent Italian director of films such as \"Castle of Blood\", \"The Virging of Nuremberg\" and \"And God Said To Cain\"). The most obvious tribute for cult-cinema fans is the film's score: Tarantino re-uses large parts of Ennio Morricone's soundtrack to Sergio Sollima's brilliant Spaghetti Western \"La Resa Dei Conti\" (\"The Big Gundown\", 1966). \n\nThe phrase 'kosher porn' has been tossed around by some reviewers to describe the visceral, vengeful joy the film provides. These certainly aren't the Jewish characters you tend to see in more conventional war films. Their gleeful, effervescently comic brutality makes the Nazis the victims, inverting preconceptions of the place of Jewish figures in war films by making them figures of absolute power rather than desperate resisters. It's actually their Nazi victims that seem to elicit glimmers of sympathy rather than our heroes. We're given very little background on the Basterds themselves, whilst their scalped, carved and shot targets talk of defending their people, hugging their mothers and seeing their children grow up.\n\nMy two major quibble with the film is it's set-up. The way the movie is set up, it's only loosely thrown together until everything at the end brings the stories together. So for the first hour and a half (or around there), this movie felt like a constantly changing anthology. Once chapter five binds it together and gives us a typical great Tarantino ending, it makes the movie whole. But the looseness of the film towards the middle brought up questions as to what the purpose of different characters were. Luckily, the answers are all in the last chapter.\n\nThe other detail that didn't ring true for me was the fact that the German movie star, Zoller, suddenly became an asshole right before getting killed. For me, even in a movie that admits its manipulative techniques, that went over the line. Instead of showing a character which had been portrayed as kind and well-behaved getting randomly killed for getting in the way of vengeance, I suspect QT felt the need to suddenly darken the character so we wouldn't hold his death against the movie and I thought that was a cheap shot. Regardless, Shohana and Zoller's truncated love story is the emotional center of this epic film.\n\nQuentin Tarantino has yet again made another movie masterpiece. This one is one of leisure, but at the same time a constantly changing story. By the end, this film has delivered the goods. The rest of the film sets up what will happen with typical rich Tarantino dialogue, and some bloody violence. Definitely it's a unique take on World War II.\n\nReview Number: 27",

Brad Pitt also delivers one of his most unexpected and unusual performance. \n2)The struggle for love by Donnie is well shown and different phases of his relation with Shosanna are well portrayed by QT. \n3) The third chapter involving Michael Fassbender is shot explicitly in a way that the audience are bound to withhold their breath and build the tension till the end of the chapter.\nNegatives\n1) Using almost 5 different languages in a single movie and relaying on the subtitle alone was difficult.\n2) The biggest loophole in the film comes during the last chapter. Look, till then we have seen Col. Hans \"The Jew Hunter\"(Christoph Waltz) as a man with extra ordinary intelligence and  manipulating ability. The opening chapter shows how he was able to change the mind of a man and ooze the information about the location of a Jew family whom he protects(that shows the power of manipulation). Then we see him finding out who  the mole among them is(Diane Kruger) and he alone finds it out and then kill her without any doubt( here we see the man's intelligence). But the inglorious Basterds are able to cheat him by giving him assurance of wealth and power in America for hiding the information that he knows about a plan to assassin Hitler and party and to give assistance to this plan. He walks away with the Inglorious Basterds even without proper security, such an intelligent man should have considered the possibility of the Basterds back firing  him.\n3) The critics are those people whom I always find to give unbiased importance to historical accuracy, come on they even shoot down Hitler here, where is the historical accuracy now. The way that Hitler is shot down is insulting, I would have loved it if QT shot down Osama Bin Ladan like this in his own version of the Zero Dark Thirty, come on its Hitler here( this doesn't mean that I support any of the bastardy  that Hitler  did during his rein). History is like a whore that sleeps with those all who are fortunate in wars and spoils. So if it had been Hitler who had won in the 2nd world war, the world would have recognised him as a hero now.\n4) Too much of head scalping was not easy to watch.",

To me, the entire film seems like a boy's war fantasy, as though Quentin was expressing his hate for the Nazi's and was imagining how he would like Der Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler to die, rather than the rather dull and non-triumphant and non-fictitious suicide. There are lots of good laughs throughout the film, but I would not call it an actual comedy. It draws laughter from violence--rather sadistic. I would consider it as Tarantino would: a drama film. Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa and Martin Wuttke as Adolf Hitler are stunning, the latter resembling his character in almost every aspect. The rest of the crew like Dianne Kruger and Brad Pitt are also pretty good. The soundtrack used by Tarantino for this film, which consisted of pieces written by various artists including the great Ennio Morricone (from 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly') somehow makes the film feel like a Western cowboy showdown movie rather than a Nazi war film, but then again, this movie is Tarantino's fantasy. Actually, the soundtrack works pretty well. Overall, this is an impressive and quite an unconventional film, which I truly enjoy.",

And Sam Jackson does some narration.  \nNow here are some warnings: there are a lot of scenes that are almost completely subtitled!  Eee gads!  You have to do some reading... in a film?!  Buck up pussies.  You remember how to read right?  Stop being a bunch of whiny bitches when it comes to subtitles.  Also, most scenes are dialogue heavy.  Now I know what you're gonna say next, \"Tarantino does action, not dialogue.\"  Well, that may not be, but you'll have to go with the flow or get the fuck out of the theater if you don't expect people to talk in a Tarantino movie.  Lastly, even though the Basterds are in the title, there comes long spans of time without seeing them or Brad Pitt but don't worry kids, it'll all come together in the end.

He's putting most of his energy into dialogue, and we're treated to scenes and conversations that we can actually settle into - and most of them all depend on context, subtext, who knows what and who doesn't - two people talking at a table and it is FASCINATING, EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT stuff.

The Tarantino's violence in the movie doesn't bring much (little shooting and killing scenes), but when the ending it's really a marvel show of weapons, blood and explosions satisfy the genre fans. The cast it's perfectly selected and perfectly acted; all act in this movie do a well work in this movie, since a Brad Pitt to a M\u00e9lanie Laurent, especial mention to Christoph Waltz, who the darkly (and creepy) humor meets a satanic character. Finally, Tarantino's direction are very witty and he knows what he want without displaying a bouquet of egocentricity (like \"Death Proof\").

Inglorious Basterds is a bizarrely original take on World War II and blends horrific violence and comic relief perfectly. This is withouth a doubt my favourite Tarantino film other than Pulp Fiction. It has everything wanted and expected of a Tarantino film with a great script, magnificent performances and memorable characters.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Lt. Aldo Raine who leads a team of killers known as the Bastards into Nazi-occupied France to kill every Nazi that crosses their path. He gives an enjoyable and comic performance and is by far one of Tarantino's most likeable characters to date. Christoph Waltz steals the show as Col. Hans (The Jew Hunter). Hans is my favourite of all of Tarantino's created characters and nobody could of portrayed this character over than Waltz. Christoph Waltz's dialogue is superbly wrote and his performance is nothing short of spectacular.\n\nThe supporting cast is strong with good performances from M\u00e9lanie Laurent, Diane Kruger, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender and Til Schweiger. Also there's a great cameo from Mike Myers. The different stories within the film cross over brilliantly and the climax is thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nInglorious Bastards celebrates and incorporates everything that is great about Quentin Tarantino's film making. The cast is perfectly assembled and the diversity of big Hollywood names and unknowns is well balanced. The script for me is Tarantino's best piece to date, its twisted, chilling and surprisingly comical also. The violence is glorified and controversially questionable as expected, but entertaining and of an acquired taste.\n\nIm so pleased this film was finally made as its been on the cards and been toyed with by Tarantino for years. With stand out performances from Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, a stunning script and iconic set pieces, Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards can only be described as a masterpiece.",

I think it's because it was very colorful, so that made it more happy for me. This was kind of a happy film, even though it was based off of a really dark and depressing subject, and I love it how Tarantino set the mood for this. I think that this is one of his most well acted movies too, and Brad Pitt proves what an underrated actor he is in this film with is great performance. The only thing I didn't like was how long the scenes were that were subtitled, because after a while when I am reading a movie, it's hard for me to stay focused because I get bored.

            "content": "Auteurism is a term coined for directors like Tarantino. His movies are quickly recognisable for many reason; dialogue (a lot of it), soundtrack, references to movies from yester-year, clever juxtapositions of styles and super-cool-ness. Inglorios Basterds is no different.\n\nI find the soundtrack and music to the film magnificent. For a man who has spaghetti westerns running through his veins, the music of Morricone is instantly recognisable. In my mind he is the greatest composer for movie soundtracks to walk the face of the Earth - period. When the music pumps out over certain scenes it makes me tingle. Due to the tone he has used it makes a lot of the film seem like a western to me. Just with soldiers instead of cowboys. COME ON GUYS, work with me here! Both wear funny hats, boots and carry guns ... no?\nLike Kill Bill's East meets West feel, Basterds has an America meets France feel to it. Obviously its in the story, but the shots and music cleverly intertwining to create something new. A totally \"Franerican\" feel to it. While we're on the subject of soundtracks, the use of certain specific tracks taken from other movies like Kelly's Heroes and Zulu Dawn, at the moments they were used, adds an extra dimension. The David Bowie song Cat People (putting out the fire) is unexpected and another interesting, intriguing, absorbing and enthralling moment. \nMoving past the music, I found the movie really fun. It moves from very dark to very light hearted quite quickly. I am not the biggest Brad Pitt fan in the world but I must admit I loved him in this movie. Especially his attempted Italian, sorry EYE-talian. I am however, a big Fassbender fan (wowee!) and was entertained by him in this movie, as with everything he's done. \n\nI wanted to mention (whilst language is on the table) that I made some heavy and judgemental comments about The Boy in Striped Pyjamas' usage of The Queens English. This movie highlights my point all the way through. The importance of accent and language, whether laughing at EYE-talian or asking to move to the English language for the remainder of the conversation. It's funny and interesting in Inglourious Basterds for the same reason its wrong in Striped Pajamas. For authenticity, for the script to work, for the audience to \"buy-into\" the movie and for credibility you must get it right - otherwise it's a joke. \n\nIn short, Inglourious Basterds is a mass of contrasting styles; American's - in France, Nazi's - killing Nazi's, war movie - Western soundtrack, scalping - in '40's France, fact and fiction. It's entertaining, different, fun and although it's not up there with the best war movies or even the best Tarantino movies it definitely doesn't disappoint. I enjoyed it a lot.",

The film you see is not the film that is meant to be seen, and that's why I give it a high mark, as opposed to the first time i watched it, and got bored. The second viewing therefore is mandatory for any Tarantino fan who like me, didn't get it the first time. The direction, well it's Tarantino, so it is sublime but the camerawork is its own story here. The language doesn't quite fit for me, but who would have expected it to, and on a certain level, that works as an element of the bizarre and unusual (despite it being a Tarantino staple).

It's filed with memorable scenes thanks in large part to a fantastic performance by Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa, one of Tarantino's most accomplished characters. Furthermore, it features an excellent soundtrack consisting of Ennio Morricone's most classic spaghetti western peaces. These, together with the anachronistic use of David Bowie's Cat People may seem odd choices for a WW2 era movie but manage to fit perfectly into the film's narrative.\n\nIt may feel slightly bloated at times with a running time a tad longer than it needs to be, but that doesn't keep Inglourious Basterds from being one of the best movies of 2009.",

            "content": "I thought it was pretty great. However, I feel that because it was made by Tarantino, reviewers are too quick to jump on board and claim it to be a masterpiece when really it wasn't. It was more like 2.5 hours of Tarantino indulging his inner movie-geek by putting all his favorite elements of film into one. And there is nothing wrong with that because his combination of beautiful violence, complex dialogue and black humor make for a great film, but it definitely wasn't his greatest.\n\nThe stand out for me was Melanie Laurent, who played Shoshanna. She had all the qualities of Tarantino's leading ladies- she was uniquely beautiful and equally as feisty. The final scenes with her (I don't want to ruin it for anyone) were pure film gold. Brad Pitt was also fantastic as Aldo Raine as was Eli Roth as Donny, or the 'Bear Jew'.\n\nTarantino does violence and death scenes with such absolute beauty; the gore is underplayed because the use of slow motion, epic music and stunning bloodwork is captivating. I did find some of his talking heads scenes to be a little drawn out- I know Tarantino writes wonderfully intelligent dialogue but some of the tangents seemed like he was trying to prove just how much he knows about film, rather than being integral to the scene.\n\nI also found Diane Kruger a bit of a let down. Her character Bridget von Hammersmark was great, but I don't think Kruger took ownership of the role. She didn't have the confidence or charisma of any of Tarantino's other main ladies.\n\nOverall a great cinematic experience, but perhaps not as supreme as it has been talked up to be. I actually think reviewers are scared they will lose credibility if they don't rate a Tarantino film- but seeing as I have none, what have I got to lose?",

            "content": "Unbelievable. I put off watching the film and finally thought I could watch it in two sittings, but I was mesmerized from the beginning.  It baffles me how Tarantino can pull off this film.  The plot is straightforward, the characters are one dimensional, though Waltz' character had some depth, and the world is simply good versus evil.  How in the world does he pull it off?  \n\nThe genius of Tarantino is his dialogue and the small twists he throws into his scenes.  His mastery of language and dialogue is ridiculous.  The humor and thoughtfulness that goes into it is always fresh.  His scenes are built to capture your attention and not let go of you until he reveals the ending.  You think you know what is going to happen, and you will be partially correct, but his twists each time surprise you.  \n\nTarantino weaves and fuses different genres, from westerns, noir, war movies, exploitation films in such a way that baffle the viewer. Tarantino does what any amateur film lover wish he could do.  He provides original material wrapped up inside gems of the past creating a huge puzzle for the film lover to piece together and entertainment for the rest.  His mastery of the genres and film making camera shots know how to create truly \"moving pictures.\"\n\nThe movie will not be appreciated by WWII purists and those who detest gore. If you can watch it for the film experience, you need to watch it.\n\nWhat is fascinating, which I have not seen discussed, is that Tarantino recognizes Hitler's love of moving pictures.  Hitler even considered going to a fine arts type college, but was not accepted.  Hitler would never attend a public screening, but would watch movies on his own.  Charlie Chaplin was one of his favorite film makers.\n\nI want to simply give this movie four stars for being a well told narrative with not much depth, but a small voice tells me I need to watch it again and I have a feeling it will make me appreciate it even more.  It is definitely a film I need to watch again.",

But when these two words are twisted and tagged together as Inglourious Basterds and are then used to depict a historical war drama, then the rider must be Quentin Tarantino. It doesn\u00e2(TM)t get any zanier than this even when you just think about it.\n\nOver the years Quentin has epitomized blending gore with any genre of movie making giving it his own twist and kick. The same eccentricity made it in to the homes of thousands of people who devour his slick film making, shady storytelling, dystopian framing etc. making it one of the biggest \u00e2cult clubs\u00e2? of quintessential Hollywood filmdom. In this latest installment Quentin, for the very first time in his illustrious career, goes historic and war raven still keeping up with his usual clutches and brakes.\n\nPlot:\n\nColonel Hans Landa aka The Jew Hunter (Christoph Waltz) ravages a jewish family in Nazi occupied France leaving behind a teenage girl Shosanna (Melanie Laurent). About the same time lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) is forming a killer posse of his own whose motto and target is 100 Nazi scalps. Rest of the story is all about Landa, Raine and Shosanna coming together for a dramatic showdown trying to work their convoluted ways out for the same end result.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nTarantino\u00e2(TM)s films are as multi-layered as an onion \u00e2\" the more you peel around it the more you\u00e2(TM)ll decipher it. He follows the same textbook approach of appending each piece of the story separately first and then comes a chapter towards the end where in everything just silks like a smoothie. All the characters are introduced in his usual care-less-not-panache punch style and the juices keep flowing with fascinating individual performances.\n\nThe simple notion of girl trying to avenge her family\u00e2(TM)s death blow seems archaic enough but the same has been depicted really well mainly by the historic backdrop and Quentin\u00e2(TM)s eccentric sense of humor infused in to every frame. The most sellable quote from original promos - War the Quentin\u00e2(TM)s way \u00e2\" remains intact with adequate portions of love, revenge, gore, drama, treachery and espionage blended to it (through actor\u00e2(TM)s performances and the main core plot).\n\nPerformances:\n\nChristoph Waltz as Landa is a jewel of find and he strikes like a blazing saddle in desert sun. One would definitely wonder about his whereabouts all these days. None of the contemporary era folks witnessed the fury and anger of 1940\u00e2(TM)s especially through human counterparts. But all this has to change with the character of Landa. He can command a cold blooded execution after a glass of milk with the usual ease of ordering a beer at the bar counter. He\u00e2(TM)s definitely the finest performer of the bunch.\n\nBrad Pitt as Aldo Raine entertains us with his atypical southern accent and decent performance. Melanie Laurent as Shosanna is the next surprise package. Her antics were top notch especially in the following scenes\n\n--> Her family\u00e2(TM)s gruesome murder\n--> The scene where she meets Colonel Landa again and\n--> Plotting an ambush against the Nazis\n\nScenes worth a mention:\n\nJust like all Tarantino movies \u00e2\" Inglourious Basterds also has its share of sparks when it comes to canning commendable scenes for the big screen. You cannot even wince and miss a miniscule piece of action during the scenes below:\n\n--> Colonel Landa executing a family in cold blood (the simple introduction, interrogating the Frenchman, threatening his family and finishing up the swift kill up is as poetic as it can get)\n--> The Basterds episode of scalping (haunting background score throughout the scene)\n--> Simple but utterly violent shoot out scene at the bar and \n--> German ambush at the theater",

What might be even more distinctive though is Tarantino's portrayal of the Third Reich as, among other things, the most horrible film studio and era in the history of film.  Not only is this film's conclusion a fantastic alternate ending for one of history's worst wars, it's also a passionate vanquishing of a suffocated era of German and French cinema.  It serves to liberate both the Jews and the filmmakers from the atrocious norm that had developed.  Like in most totalitarian societies, the artistry was greatly reduced and concentrated into a few key pieces, Riefenstahl's films in the case of Nazi Germany.  Also, pairing the story of Shosanna, a female Jewish survivor and the namesake Basterds of the film gave the story more tension and dynamism than it would have sported had the story just been about one of them.\n\nThe other thing about this film that demands mention (besides Christoph Waltz) is the style and beautiful visuals.  Tarantino inserts very entertaining mini-documentaries, title freezes, and ultra-dramatic music into the overall narrative, making the grindhouse and spaghetti western influences front and center at times.  The cinematography, costumes, and production design are all quite premium.  Even though the story and dialog is front and center with this film, it is undoubtedly one of the most visually sexy Tarantino films yet released.  \n\nWell, anything else I'd say in a review at this point would do you less service than seeing the actual film, so please do.  You'll be treating yourself to a highly stylish and entertainingly iconic film.  (31 December 2012)",

Also help his screenplay, which for me is the best script of a war film. The Tarantino's violence in the movie doesn't bring much, but when the ending it's really a show of weapons, blood and explosions satisfy the genre fans. The cast it's perfectly selected and perfectly acted; all act in this movie do a well work in this movie. Finally, Tarantino's direction are very good and he knows what he want without displaying a bouquet of egocentricity. With this good aspects Inglourious Basterds is a Tarantino genre-blending thrill ride, but not another incendiary masterpiece.",

            "content": "Another masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino! Tarantino's alternate history/fictional story surrounding World War II and Nazi occupied France is a dramatic, sometimes funny, often clever and always entertaining war film.\n\nThe film had various different sub plots that all tied up quite nicely to the film's main story surrounding a Nazi film premiere that will be attended by Fuhrer himself and high rankers. A plot to get rid of the Nazi's by American soldiers known as the \"Basterds\" lead by Lt. Aldo Raine in an amazing performance by Brad Pitt, playing the role of the Southern soldier, complete with mannerisms and accent to perfection, Pitt's character as well served at times as \"black comic\" relief. \n\nTarantino again brilliantly devises his \"chapter\" technique in this film, dividing up small story arcs leading up to one awesomely executed climax, the end of the war in the burning theatre room orchestrated by a vengeful surviving Jewish woman from the film's opening massacre.  The woman, Shosanna played emotionally by Melanie Laurent was a perfect casting. \n\nThe film had a greatly assembled cast from small roles played by Michael Fassbender and Mike Myers. However the film's standout performance no doubt goes to Christoph Waltz as the classy, but deviant and dangerous SS Colonel Hans Landa. He was evil, remorseless and upon film's end a traitor to the country he served for years. Waltz's performance was so great it garnered him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, no doubt, he is truly deserving of this. \n\nI praise the film's costume design and set decoration making the film feel very authentic and as accurate to 1940's Nazi occupied France as possible. \n\nTarantino creates yet another unique film that in the years to come will be regarded as among some of the best war films.",

This film, like any great film, has a lot of its substance up for interpretation, as an impressionist may have with a painting of his that is considered a masterpiece. It's a very sad matter that many people nowadays take things in film too seriously, and don't bother to scope out a film's true subject matter.

            "content": "One of the problems with Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds becomes evident within the long and brilliant opening sequence.  Col. Hans Landa arrives at a French farmhouse looking for Jews.  He engages the owner in a long conversation in French, but then asks to speak to the proprietor in English, in order to better practice that language.  The switch has a narrative purpose, since Landa wants to threaten the owner in a language that the hidden Jews are unable to understand, but the film is also winking at the audience, making fun of the American disdain for subtitles by saying plainly, \"yeah, I could have done this scene in English the whole time.\"  \n\n       The opening scene is not only one of the best in the movie, but one of the best Tarantino has ever shot as well, but as the movie continues, the constant winking at \"this is only a movie, let's have fun\" and the truly horrific real life events that the film is depicting an alternative to, becomes more and more disturbing.  The opening sequence begins the story of Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), the one escapee of this horrible massacre, who spends the next few years obsessed with revenge.  While Tarantino made a revenge movie successfully with Kill Bill, that film actually had moral complexity, despite existing in the cartoonish world of Kung Fu and Samurai movies.  Shoshanna remains fairly one-dimensional, and though her revenge may be just as deserved and more horrific than that of the Bride, there is no moral reflection on her part.  She never seems to question what she is doing even for a moment.  \n\n       Due to the cutting back and forth between Shoshanna and The Basterds themselves, a group of Jewish American soldiers out to kill Hitler, the movie has less narrative thrust then Kill Bill and meanders.  The depiction of the  Basterds is equally morally simplistic.  Led by Aldo Raines (Brad Pitt), a southern fried gentile tough guy caricature, the group brutally tortures and maims Nazi soldiers, in a way that makes us question why we should regard them as any better than the Nazis themselves.  The fact that the existence of this group in this movie whitewashes American anti-Semitism to make it seem as if our country was pro-Jewish, and ignores the fact that the horrors of the Holocaust, that these Jewish soldiers are presumably avenging, were unknown to American soldiers at the time, makes the rewriting of history offensive.  \n\n      Tarantino shows none of the moral complexity of some of the films that inspired this one.  In Sam Fuller's The Big Red One, we are given a gritty and ironic look at war that shows how it dehumanizes us, but at the same time seems like a rollicking adventure film.  In The Dirty Dozen, the soldiers are convicts sent on a suicide mission to earn their freedom.  They do not want to fight but must.  Their mission is similar to the Basterds, but they are simply a merry band of sadists, and Tarantino does not have a single character among them that stands out.  \n\n        The movie does have its pleasures.  There is a long sequence in the middle of the film involving a movie star working as a spy that matches the opening sequence for brilliance.  There is also the great Oscar winning performance from Christoph Waltz as Landa, the movies chief villain.  Waltz is so good in the movie that he makes the reprehensible villain impossible not to love and even when the ironic ending arrives and he gets what he deserves, this underscores the cruelty of the vision Tarantino has created.  \n\n           Perhaps the most controversial element in the movie is the way that it rewrites history to give World War 2 a feel good ending.  This is ballsy work by Tarantino, but what is the point?  Showing Jews blowing Hitler away may be fun revenge fantasy, but it only makes it more depressing the realities of the Holocaust.    We know this did not happen and there is nothing clever about it.  It comes off as lazy and puerile.  Aldo Raines tells us at the end \"this just might be my masterpiece,\" but Mr. Tarantino needs to keep looking for a film to match Pulp Fiction in his distinctive oeuvre.",

It works, kind of if you're more of a \"pulling against\" kind of guy rather than a \"pulling for.\" To me, Inglorious Basterds just says, \"here are some Nazis, lets shoot em' up,\" with no more depth. Its suppose to be funny. It really isn't. It just seems like a bunch of gore that leaves me feeling little. The good guys aren't that interesting, just annoying. The best part of the film was in the story of Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger. For their contribution this movie gets 2.5 stars, without them it wouldn't be worth watching.",

It's not historically accurate either, but leave your degree at the door and enjoy the two and a half hours of genius unfold before you. This movie is one of the best Tarantino films I have ever seen. The music's great, the action is top notch and the actors do an awesome job of playing their roles.",
