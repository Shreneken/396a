There's nothing that dates this movie in an outright way, however I feel it's starting to be dated just by the overall visual style of the time. Early 2000s indy films just look a certain type of way, and in my opinion thats starting to date some movies. While it didn't seem too striking at the time, Jim Carrey basically dressing like a very early emo kid/hipster sticks out a little too much from the rest of the character styles. I would say it's pretty damn good, but it just teters on the brink of being great. Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it though. 7.75/10",

            "content": "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the end result of combining sci-fi and romance into a wholly original and superbly acted script. Joel (played with an every-man nuance by Jim Carrey in a way not seen since his turn on The Truman Show) breaks up with his girlfriend, Clementine (played by Kate Winslet with an artistic, indie girl charm) and decides to undergo an experimental procedure in which she is erased from his memories so that the post-breakup healing can commence without those pesky doubts and regrets that so often accompany the end of a relationship. The process itself is the bulk of the film and viewers are treated into glimpses of Joel's mind as Clementine is systematically deleted. It isn't until Joel is under and the procedure has began that he realizes that even though his breakup was difficult he was shaped by it, and losing all of those experiences (the good and the bad) would erase a part of himself. What results is Joel's attempts to hang on to what is important by fighting through the feelings that attach themselves to each piece of their relationship and fighting the efforts of those hired to purge these memories (Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo) while inside of the procedure. It's a beautiful film whose subject matter is complex enough to be engaging while being relatable enough to be sympathetic to either outcome. It's a modern classic detailing the entirety of a relationship in a completely original and captivating way that makes viewers consider their own experiences as the credits roll. A masterpiece of filmmaking.",

            "content": "\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a movie that uses the fragility of memory and hurt of love to show the desperate measures taken by a couple who decide to break up. After two years of living together, Introverted Joel Barrish ( Jim Carey ) and extrovert Clementine Kruczynski ( Kate Winslet ) undertake extreme procedures to erase any memory of each other.\u00a0\n\nWhat director Michel Gondry and Writer Charlie Kaufman have created is a movie designed to slowly release forgotten incidents and emotions as the audience discover the film is running in reverse. Bearing witness to love's decay the audience are thrown sidelines with the introduction of Patrick ( Elijah Wood ) and Stan ( Mark Ruffalo ). Both Patrick and Stan work for Lacuna a private medical company with some rather dodgy practices regarding memory erasure. Along with Patrick and Stan, Mary ( Kirsten Dunst ) Stan's girlfriend is also a work colleague and joins the other two when they are tasked with erasing any memory of Clementine from Joel's mind. Patrick however uses information provided to Lacuna by both Joel and Clementine to manipulate Clementine in an attempt to get her to fall in love with him.\n\nWhat ensues is a battle of the mind to try and save their relationship after discovering that all was not as bad as the couple believed. But with each recalled memory there is a doomed ending that ends up being erased. The only hope is to try and hide Clementine in an earlier non related memory in Joel's mind as Lacuna remove all traces of each other. The climax of the film comes with a surprise that complicates any post mind erasing procedures.\u00a0\n\n\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" evokes real devastation in lost love and tells a fantasy tale of how we all try to erase those hurtful memories. However, after everything, our memories are all we really have, they make us who we are, once they are gone, we ourselves are surely gone.",

The pace may be a bit slow, which plunges Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind into a small tide of mediocrity, but it still makes up for it in other areas. The script is very well-written, and incorporates \"philosophical\" elements in a natural way, in contrast to what usually happens when other movies do the same, to the point the movie's name was inspired by these elements and it didn't seem \"fake\" or forced at all. There's always a feel-good vibe, which is a paradox taking into consideration the situation during most of the movie. The direction is excellent and the actors show a certain level of maturity that meets the standards set by the plot, especially from Jim Carrey. On the other hand, Kate Winslet gets into the shoes of her character so meticulously and harmoniously, almost as if she was playing herself. And of course the two have memorable chemistry together, rendering the final result worthy of watching.",

I found the idea, that you really love someone right now, but you know that you will not love them in the future, an incredible idea. It aswell tackles subjects as, memories will never be removed, at least if you force it. The production design and VFX are incredible, some of the best and most creative i have ever seen.

I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.\n\nI especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.\n\nI was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.\n\nI have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.\n\nOverall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The fateful reconnecting of two people whose memory of each other has been erased is just ridiculous, in particular when they decide to have a romantic relationship again (I mean seriously, how many simulations would have to be run before that happens? 200 billions?). The return of their memories via tapes reaches a summit of stupidity, in particular since it does not stop them to giving it another try. None of this makes any sense. I did not like the course of action either. Sometimes the story is nil but the movie is pleasant. Here the story is bad and the movie is unpleasant.

So that was how he came back that same day, with lots of love and joy, and he apologized for his mistake, and for the pain he caused me when he left. Then from that day, our relationship was now stronger than how it was before, All thanks to Lord Zuma. he is so powerful and I decided to share my happiness on the internet that Lord Zuma is real. if you are here and you need your ex lover back or save your marriage fast.

I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.\n\nI especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.\n\nI was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.\n\nI have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.\n\nOverall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This is my first watch in a long time and there are so many poignant scenes that make-up this original plot. To name a few of them, when Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are under the blanket together, when they're in bed on the beach, the Grand Central scene, and, most notably, when Clem is saying goodbye to Joel as the beach-front house is crumbling behind her. *Side Note* This is the movie that introduced me to the name \"Joel,\" which I named the protagonist to my first novel. The plot is clever, but not confusing. It's smart and layered, but not pretentious. There's also an excellent sub-plot concerning the Lacuna Co.'s doctor (Tom Wilkinson) and the receptionist (Kirsten Dunst), which shows how the procedure can be abused and ineffective. The effects hold-up and brilliantly portray what erasing a memory might look like. It also contains hints of creepiness, with blank, contorted faces like something out of The Ring. The ending answers its own question for its protags, but poses one for the viewers: If you heard everything your (ex)partner had to say about you before they erased you from their memory, would give it another shot? I like the answer we get for Joel and Clem.",

            "content": "Michel Gondry's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is an original, heartwarming and deeply touching sci-fi romance that showcases Charlie Kaufmann's mind-bending strengths as a screenwriter. With his second feature, French filmmaker Michel Gondry created a mesmerizing mind-bending romance that's stood test of time as a modern-day classic. Using captivating cinematography, Gondry draws viewers into the ill-fated romance between two star-crossed lovers that erase each other from their memories. Gondry's decision to shoot the movie using handheld cinematography is risky, but it works immensely. It lends palpable tension and unnerving panic to the movie, giving viewers sensations of how it truly feels to lose one's most precious memories of lovers. Gondry exhibits impressive control over production design, editing and musical score, using these elements to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Charlie Kaufman's script is also sensational, and expertly uses a nonlinear narrative to convey psychological trauma faced by an ill-fated couple that lose each other's memories. It's hard to not praise phenomenal performances from the cast. Jim Carrey delivers one of his best career performances as Joel Barish. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the frustrations, sexual jealousy and lifelong regrets of an introverted writer that strives to erase his former girlfriend from his memory. Kate Winslet is equally astonishing in the role of a free-spirited woman that openly rejects men in her life. In one of her earliest roles, Winslet brings youthful energy to a Manic-Pixie character that signals her future stardom. Although \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is undeniably an unforgettable sci-fi romance, ultimately it isn't a flawless film. Gondry's decision to conclude the movie on an ambiguous note that blurs fantasy and reality is bold and unexpected, but it doesn't entirely work. Nevertheless, fans of sci-fi romances will definitely enjoy \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" and so will movie-goers seeking thought-provoking entertainment. If Cinema has power to change the ways people see memories, hopefully it will lead modern-day couples to hold onto memories of their most precious relationships even if their recollections of beloved partners risk being erased from minds over time.",

He's soft spoken, polite, shy. It's wonderful to see him nail this role so well. Kate Winslet is excellent as always and the movie won a screenplay oscar that was well deserved, but it's really Jim Carrey that truly makes the movie work. If there is a role he really deserved an Academy Award for this is it. It's impossible not to like Joel. And even with her craziness, it's impossible not to fall for Clementine also.

The very idea of the movie is fascinating, and from there the script and visuals take you on a journey the likes of which you've never experienced. This film did such a terrific job of recreating what our memories and thoughts can seem like in our head. Our minds are so complex that we go from one geographic location to another instantly, or people pop in and out of our thoughts instantly, and the movie depicts what those thoughts are like. In our dreams, we see people in places and times that they never were in real life, and the movie also recreates what that is like. Just brilliant.\n\n*** Spoilers below ***\n\nI liked that Clem was a perfect fit for Joel, and likewise he for her. They were just what each other needed but didn't know it. They both had to reach a point where they could accept the other person's flaws and move on, which is how relationships have to be for people to stay together. There are no perfect people. We must reach a point where we think we can suffer enough of the other person's flaws to stay with them, and vice versa. In that way, I thought the ending was good.\n\nThere were a couple of things that I felt the film was going to revisit when it didn't, and therefore I felt let down slightly. Joel worked so hard at creatively finding ways to put Clem in odd places in his mind in order to secure a memory of her. I thought it was certain that he would later trigger a memory of her in that way, for instance by remembering being under the kitchen table as a child, and then that would link to Clem. The way it worked out with receiving the tapes was adequate but not as interesting to me.",

This is basically a full star cast, which is why the movie turned out to be so great. Every single shot of the movie is taken so well.

The plot is beautiful and simple, as its idea is that everything anyways comes down to love, which is why after watching this movie you may feel both happy and sad, depending on the status of your relationship, perhaps, as the movie is very touching about this point.

But at the same time, very few films ever attempt to challenge a film like Eternal Sunshine in concept or execution, so it remains a very powerful film.",

I did not expect the most original romance movie I've ever witnessed the first time I watched it, or the strange and unexpected performance from Jim Carey that I never would have expected from a man known for his physical comedy and over the top acting. It introduced me to the phenomenal writing and very creative mind of Charlie Kaufman, it was directed in an insanely original fashion with a lot of practical effects and it was all the better for it. It's original and funny, and despite its inclusion of memory erasing, it is actually the most real depiction of a romance between two people who feel like you know them. The way the movie plays out making us all relate to how difficult a break up can be, but also how we may regret a lot of things, we don't really want to forget. Those memories make us who we are. It's truly a humorous and simultaneously sad tale that everyone can relate to in some way or another.",

Now for Kate Winslet, all I'm going to say is just WOW, an amazing and incredible performance that I will never forget, her attitude and the way she represented that character \"Clementine\" was so accurate and exactly how it should be, a great choice and so happy that she got nominated for an Oscar.\n\nThe custom designs were so incredible, especially Clementine's (played by Kate Winslet), it did match with her hair and with Clementine's character. The many different hair colors of Clementine Kruczynski was so amazing and loved how it helps the viewer keep track of where her relationship with Joel (Played by Jim Carrey) corresponds to the plot.\n\nThe script was so very well written and really deserved an Oscar win, loved how the movie makes you think that this thing happens first but in the end, you see that it was the other way around and for those who saw the movie will get what I mean, really wish if I can talk more about that part but I can't or I'll spoil many things.\n\nThe movie has many scenes that are \u2018'classic'' and will just be stuck in your head like the one when Clementine and Joel were laying on the ice and watching the stars, or the scene where Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) are dancing in their underwear over an unconscious Joel.\n\nEternal sunshine of the spotless mind is a deep movie that shows you that if a person gets attached to someone else, they will never forget them even if they do the impossible. A great movie and one of my all-time favorites.\n\nMy rating is: 9/10\n\nDO NOT READ THIS PART IF U HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE \nI have read once that one version of the script of the movie ends with Clementine and Joel in an endless cycle of erasures and getting back together. In the last scene, an elderly Clementine visits Dr. Mierzwiak, and the screenplay calls for the audience to see a computer screen showing 15 dates of previous erasures stretching back 50 years, all of them involving Joel Barish. I would really love to see that version, especially that ending, it sounds interesting and its a great ending, not saying that the \u2018'actual ending'' sucks but I think that other version would've been way better.",

The film excels at placing the viewer in the same conflicted point of view as Joel himself, and while I was initially of the opinion that the story fell apart without a clear chemistry between Carrey and Winslet, the final reunification of the two really drives home their unorthodox, awkwardly balanced magnetism that was initially presented in such an unhealthy lens. What a turn for Carrey, who completely confirms the critics' suspicions of his comprehensive dramatic chops previously hinted at in projects such as The Truman Show. (4.5/5)",

This does not mean I find it the best film ever made but I have been learning to consider emotional impacts as part of the quality of a film (it might be an inexplicable and possibly unjustified feeling but you cannot deny it). I was thrilled throughout the whole movie and its several different tones and moments. What really got to me was the fact that, after all this thrill, I realized this movie is just talking about a relationships and their complications, something that has been done several times, but this one did it in such an original and creative way that blew my mind.\u2028Joel is a close-to-middle-age man who seems to have some strange anger and sadness in him as we first meet him, waking up and then on his way to work. He suddenly feels an urge to take a different train than the one he always does and just runs with an inexplicable rush, almost like he wants to go so fast as to not have time to think twice. On his impulsive journey he meets Clementine, a blue-haired woman in her 30s that seems to be the opposite of him but they just click, the connection seems immediate. They have no ideia why but it simply works. Suddenly we are taken to a new moment of Joel crying by himself while driving and the movie starts to shift from the apparently normal flerting to a crazy plot that makes you want to guess and understand what is going on almost like in a detective movie. The best thing about this is that in this much creative way of telling this couple's story, you know that there is a lot of feeling behind everything, you feel it no less than in the best films of romantic drama. The ideia that two people build an incredibly strong connection, fall in love with each other but realize they might not live happily ever after together sounds so real and frequent in life and this movie portrays it perfectly and creatively. It talks about how love can be there at all moments of a relationship, be it in the exciting beginning, in the fights over silly and serious stuff, in the boring day-to-day life and even in the break up (or maybe especially in the break up, maybe it is the reason why it is such an excruciating situation). Not all couples were meant to be together forever but most of them were meant to fall in love with each other. It might not work forever but there is a reason why it worked for sometime.\u2028This movie is fun when it has to be, it is deep even at the fun moments and it takes you all the way in a crazy journey grabbing your attention for every second of it. I really loved this experience and, as I am writing this review a few months after I first saw it, I cannot wait to watch it again.",

            "content": "The film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind produced by Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman in 2004 contains several key themes, including memory, identity, and romance. The plot revolves around Joel Barish, a single male suffering from a dysfunctional association with Kruczynski. As their relationship breaks down, both choose to erase each other's memories. As the movie progresses, Joel confesses to the audience that even though he is depressed, he starts regretting his consent to the medical procedure and desperately attempts to hang onto the jovial instances in his life (Gondry et al., 2004). Therein, smell and sight appear as two of the most reliable human senses that correlate with one's memory. Kaufman tends to complicate the script in his motion pictures, and this presentation is no exception. For instance, the narrators tell the story in a reverse fashion, which assists in hiding some information from the viewers. Kaufman and Gondry use this strategy to reveal their forgotten emotions gradually.\n\tSome of the philosophical questions that emerge in this film are whether human beings are a sum of their memories or only a compilation of experiences, and whether the process of erasing an incident from the human brain has any benefits. In the movie, the proposal of forgetting some episodes promises to increase one's happiness. The alternative is that eliminating the incident could deteriorate the mental functioning and further complicate the characters' life. Consequently, they will not have learned anything from such an experience or realize any improvement. The motion picture eventually concludes that cleaning the human mind will not result in the proverbial eternal sunshine. Erasing it can eradicate memories, but people will always remember the impulses, intuitions, and feelings that emanated from that past event. It is possible to explain the film's hidden ideology of eternal recurrence using Nietzsche's theory, as associated with the Stoics. \nThe fundamental aspect of this theory is that people needed to ask themselves questions regarding whether they would make the same decision for eternity before acting. When they pose them, the query presents the brain with the potential for new possibilities. Nietzsche presents the case of the greatness of action and dignity to people who accept their decisions for all eternity. In the film, the producers place the protagonists in this persistent situation, revealing the same outcomes, where they accept each instance to relive their decision. The characters do not learn any lessons from their troubles and only opt for the slow and dull life refusing to entertain an alternate lifestyle (Smith, 2016). From the movie, it is evident that Joel and Clementine fit into the Nietzschean description squarely because they are pure individuals who avoid any form of anguish. The main message of the motion picture is that love is flawed because it is an outcome of an imperfect human being. This feeling is linked to people; therefore, when they enter a relationship, they are already bound to have issues. \nThe film is surprisingly lacking in plot twists and sudden disclosures concerning the relationships. However, the producers display an outdated view of love's demise. The \"Eternal Sunshine\" is different from Kaufman's earlier works because he fails to impress the audience with original stunts. On the contrary, he focuses on the solemn familiarity feelings and emotions.\n\u2003\nBibliography\nBornedal, P. (2016). The surface and the abyss: Nietzsche as philosopher of mind and knowledge.

It shows both before and after this occurred, moving between the two in an incredible manner. Without spoiling it, this movie builds up to a shocking plot twist that helps tie it all together. While this movie isn't for people who just want to see a happy, upbeat movie that doesn't take a lot of effort to decipher, it certainly should appeal to most people, as even though it is a situation that has never occurred in real life, the point of the movie is very relatable and filled with scenes meant to endear towards the viewer's emotional appeal.",

            "content": "This movie is thought provoking on a couple of different levels. Initially, the thought of simply being able to forget troubled moments in life seems appealing, and im sure we all have a few people we'd like to forget. This movie mainly focuses on couples, though. We never really learn the cases of anyone other than people having relationship issues. Think back to the most recent lover you've had. Think about why you fell in love with them. There's always a reason why choose to be with someone, despite the risk of bitter, angry heartbreak later. But we always only see whats directly in front of us. At first it's wonderful, it's always full of beautiful moments. But over time, those moments don't come as frequently, and sometimes stop altogether, and things become boring, or worse. Sometimes things end bad, and you're forced to sit and reminisce on the good times. Would you forget it all just to get rid of the bad feelings? If you could relive all the good times, feel all the wonderful emotions, would you forget it all in order to forget what happens after? I think the main message of this movie is, good times come, and bad times come. But we only ever see whats in front of us. Sure, the good will pass, but so will the bad. But being able to feel the two is what makes us human, and what allows us to feel and love. Sometimes it's hard, but you have to ask yourself; was the emotions I felt before worth the emotions I'm feeling now? And will feeling different emotions later make my situation better or worse? Am I willing to give it all up just so I can numb it all now?",

She is a wondrous light in his mundane life of work and not work. Carrey is the ultimate empathetic every man in this film. You want him to be happy. Kate Winslet gives her famous \"manic pixie dream girl\" performance as Clementine. I found her at first hyperactive, then so very human as it's slowly apparent how insecure she is with her own life. Their chemistry seems off at first, but you realize they are perfect strangers in this lovely movie.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind captures our feelings in a moment. Charlie Kaufman's script is an appeal to human emotion and empathy as any film I have ever been lucky enough to have seen. How precious are memories? Do they define us? Is our life just a sequencing of memories? I believe Eternal Sunshine asks that we cherish our memories as they are the remembrances of what we have lived. Remember your love and appreciate what you have. Make memories.\n\nAside from the main themes and morale of the movie, the supporting cast is incredibly strong and subtle. Elijiah Wood is an obsessed man derailing the lives of those around him. He is as creepy as he was in Sin City, but with a subtle flair of subdued insanity. Mark Ruffalo is hilarious and goofy as the lovable mad scientist. I used to find his so ordinary in his acting, but here, Ruffalo is so relatable and interesting. He's a joy to watch and you really feel for him by the end. Tom Wilkinson is the calm and well mannered genius who profession is the erasure of dreams. I think it's evident by the end that his character is trying to escape his emotions just as much as any of his patients. Finally, my personal favorite, Kirsten Dunst as Mary. She is so charming and sweet. She plays the fun loving Mary, whose secret changes the way people feel forever. Dunst plays the profoundly sad girl you love so very well. She is enchanting on screen and you cannot help, but sympathize for her character. Mary's story is perhaps the saddest of all the character arcs in Eternal Sunshine.\n\nIt must be noted, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has, perhaps, the most astoundingly seamless film edits of any movie ever. Every time a scene shifts or transitions from scene to scene or to another location, you are stunned by the forced perspectives and hard cuts. It's so well done and obvious that each cut, angle, and frame is purposefully edited to perfection. This movie is visual euphoria. Absolutely immaculate editing, gorgeous cinematography, and superbly refined directing from Michel Gondry. Gondry's direction marks a true show of film making prowess. The deliberate manipulation of the audience through his magical framework is awe inspiring.\n\nI hope you watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I think it will make for a pleasant memory.",

Charlie Kaufman has proven to me once again that he is one of the greatest screenwriters in cinematic history. Every little detail of this world he created is just so thought-out, so surreal, and so complex. He knows where to hits the right notes at the right time. It's a shame that Charlie didn't get the direct this piece, but maybe there was a good reason he didn't. I was surprised to see Jim Carry pull off a non-comedic lead role in such a compelling way. This is definitely his best role in his entire career of acting, and he definitely deserved that Oscar he won for this role.

Charlie Kaufman's screenplay tells the story of a world where there is a company called the gap, a company that erases people from their memories so that they do not suffer. In this world there are Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) A passionate couple who insist on forgetting each other, seems like a simple script, but he comes from a genius aligned with a complete simplicity that touches, from his argument Kaufman could elaborate a mega future, where several couples erase, the Consequences, etc, etc., etc. But not Kaufman simply tells the story of a couple in love. \"Eternal Brightness of a Mind Without Remembrance\" shows us the power of love, shows us the importance of pain, erase a person from memory and end suffering, is not evolutionary, we learn from pain, from suffering, even by erasing The memories come back to make the same mistake - As shown 2x in the film - we fall in love with the same people, because the feeling of love is beyond the comprehensible, this film is one of those that we should watch in different times of our lives that with certainty We will have completely different interpretations, it is a film that will survive the test of time, because its theme will always be and will always be a highlight because it is intrinsic to the human being, the eternal brightness of love will always shine in a mind, even if it does not know. We have many merits for Kaufman, but we can not forget Michel Gondry who can cinematically reproduce Kaufman's abstract script, with scenes that refer to Lynch, Michel uses and abuses the camera, with tight, focused plans, playing with light, blurring and Playing with the dimensionality of the screen, always maintaining a palette of blue colors, photography is the least camele\u00e3o of the film, with a beautiful and unique soundtrack, it sends all the joy of the discovery mixed with the anguish and sadness of forgetfulness, despite the Confused time line, and to constantly lose its rhythm, and even to take away the climax created in its secondary history, the film technically enchants with its resources and translations of the human psyche, mainly because it is simple and real. It seems that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are changed, Jim making a focused and focused character and Kate making a laughable and funny character, fun, curious and cheerful, are 2 spectacular actors, Jin manages to pass an incredible dramatic charge, and Kate is gorgeous, In addition, we have a generally wonderful cast. We can conclude by saying that the film goes beyond a common cinematographic work, it appeals to the feeling, it not only appeals, it touches, it causes reflection, it is a film that we have to watch every 5 years, every stage of life, We will see how we will have different interpretations and reactions of the same, finally, we have a work that walks along the linear of the perfection.",

When he finally meets the right girl for him, Clementine, he is shocked to discover that long before, they were in a relationship where she erased everything about him from her memory. In retaliation and in anger, Joel does the same thing and the transformation of forgetting the memories is shown internally.\nEternal Sunshine is a change for Jim Carrey, whose often goofy and over the top comedic performances are dark and quiet here. The whole film has a gloomy atmosphere about it that, although goes along well with the depressing plot, feels lifeless. The whole film seems a bit lifeless and boring. Eternal Sunshine is a mind boggler and requires a lot of thinking. The film doesn't have enough substance in it to be interesting and loses interest and turns into a boring, confusing snoozefest very fast.

That shouldn't be surprising given that we're talking about the likes of Kirsten Dunst and Mark Ruffalo.\n\nWhat's most impressive about this one, like most of Kaufman's work, is how innately unpredictable it is- you never quite know what will happen next and yet, nothing feels out of place, every memory adds to the film's overall message. This is a complex and stirring film and, since we're dealing with love, those characteristics are what make it an honest film too. The downside?

What could Kaufman bring to the predictable romance genre?\nJoel Barish is a shy and reserved man who is struggling with his recent break with her former girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski. This felling quickly transforms into depression due to the fact Clementine took a surgery to remove all her memories about him. \nTo be honest, I have to admit that I avoid romantic films as they are repetitive and dumb, but I really loved Kaufman\u00b4s collaborations with Spike Jonze (the hilarious and unforgettable \"Being John Malkovich\", and the peculiar and ambitious \"Adaptation\") so I went looking for this film and it solidify my appreciation for Kaufman\u00b4s work. \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a film that has extremely solid acting with the standout being the main couple (both Carrey and Winslet are out of their comfort zone and they deliver), Kaufman\u00b4s script is original, fun, touching and masterfully written; the storytelling is ambitious, the comedy is hilarious, Gondry works as an acceptable Jonze substitute, memorable visuals, a couple of well executed twists, a message that's touching and extremely peculiar, editing that feels improvised but is all highly selected, an insanely high entertainment value, the couple has believable chemistry, a good soundtrack, and the characters are tragic and relatable. My only issue with the film is its lack of a worthy finale. Sure, the idea on paper sounds good but it feels lackluster compared to the rest of the film. \n\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" is a highly creative, masterfully written, well performed and touching romance. Up until 2012, this was the only romantic film I praised and genially love. If you like the genre or appreciate original and ambitious films, then this is a must see. Another success in Kaufman\u00b4s career.",

            "content": "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind speaks to everyone who has been who has had that special someone in their lives. It speaks about the troubles and silver linings to being stuck in a complicated relationship. The story follows Joel (played by Jim Carrey) as he tries to piece together where and when things got rough with the love of his life Clementine (played by Kate Winslet). He then finds a mysterious card that says that Clementine had her mind wiped of any aspect of him and their relationship. So in return, Joel asks to get the same procedure done. As he slowly sees each memory fade before his eyes, he realizes that he doesn't want to forget the times he and Clementine had together. This movie spoke to me in particular because I've been in a relationship exactly like the two leads had. It's complicated in a way that's easy to understand based on the ways that the director focused on the key moments in their relationship. There were ups and downs but I could see that they still cared about each other. This whole relationship was beautifully portrayed by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Carrey went out of his normal goofy typecast role to play a troubled man who is a bit shy but has a lot of compassion for the women that enter and leave his life. Kate Winslet is a chameleon of sorts given that she is able to portray a totally different character than she has in the past like in Titanic. She played a flawed woman who is impulsive yet cares a lot for the people she meets.  Her and Joel play really well off of each other throughout the film despite their issues with each other. They still manage to share a lot of memories that they would've loved to cherish in the end. I love how even though they both tried to forget each other, they still ended up being drawn to each other once again. That's a really sweet idea. This whole script is sweet, thought provoking, and clever as hell. Thought provoking in a way where I reflected on my relationships and what would happen if I took that procedure. The whole fading away of memories before your eyes is tragic and heartbreaking. Just think of all the time devoted to the special one in your life just gone. Never happened. It's an interesting analysis of what one side of the relationship is like for one person and what it's like for the other. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a beautiful movie that shows people what life would be like if you forgot about the special person in your life and what it would mean to them as well. A-",

The first fifteen minutes shows the start (or it appears to) of a quirky relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). For someone who hasn't read anything about the film, or hasn't heard too much of what it's about, you expect this to be the start of their relationship. If you have not seen the film, stop now, and either see it and return, or see it and don't return. If you're here at all you've shown interest in one way or another, I hope. \n\nMost people should be able to relate to \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" in one way or another. It is about the love and stress in an average relationship, including the thought of having children, the frustration of each other's company at times, and the cute inside jokes that couples often share. Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey do a wonderful job at convincing us they are for real. They're great at convincing us of their love, and they're great at convincing us of their growing aggravation of each other. \n\nSo yes, on one level, the film is about the best and worst of being in a relationship with someone you can't stand to love. However, \"Eternal Sunshine\" is also a mind-bending science fiction film. This is not for shock value nor is it for a reason unrelated to the general themes and ideas expressed. It's done for a perfectly plausible reason, it allows a deeper understanding of the characters, and a wonderful look into what love is.\n\nAfter the opening credits, and the quirky meeting of Joel and Clementine, the film seems (pay attention to the choice of words, 'seem') to have progressed some time. Joel is crying over Clementine, and he explains to his neighbors that she appears to no longer recognize who he is. Soon after, he finds out she really doesn't remember who he is - her memory has been altered to completely forget who Joel is. New, state of the art technology has allowed this to happen. \n\nThis is not something that seems at all out of place in the film, and it seems to be easily accepted by audiences. It feels as natural as any normal, everyday technology would, due to the thought behind the explanation of it, and the realistic aspects of the workplace that this mind-erasing place is. Joel, upon learning of Clementine's decision to erase him from her memory, decides to do the same. From this point until the very end, most of the film takes place in Joel's mind, as the erasers go memory to memory, getting rid of all thoughts of Clementine.\n\nThis allows the audience to trace the relationship back to the beginning. Where did they go wrong? What has caused the trouble? Joel ends up falling for Clem all over again, and doesn't want the process to continue. It's a really thought-provoking idea topped with wonderful acting, beautiful chemistry between our two main characters, and great thoughts about love and human emotion. The film is also very clever and funny, at times that are necessary, and touchingly sad and romantic. \n\nAfter the process, despite their best efforts to salvage the memories (the lovely memories), Joel and Clem are both out of each other's lives. Well, so we have thought. The beginning of the film, the spontaneous meeting on the train, is actually taking place after the mind-erasing process for both Joel and Clem. This is a beautiful realization for the audience, because we now know the power of their love (cheesy, but true) and the nature of humans regarding love for each other. Love always wins. \n\nAfter a night on the frozen lake, Clem asks Joel to spend the night at his place, as shown in the beginning and again at the end. She discovers the tapes recorded before the operation (or process, or whatever you'd like to call it), and they both listen as they describe the things they hated about each other, the things they grew to hate over the course of two years. They listen, they wonder about their current state, and how they decide they cannot see anything they don't like about the other. \n\n\"But you will.\"\n\n....\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThis scene is absolutely perfect for the conclusion: it shows they have decided to put up with each other's issues, and have proceeded to be in love for as long as reality will let them be in love. It's a wonderful ending to an even more wonderful movie.",

Too surreal to be romantic and vice versa, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's fractured sense of storytelling aptly mirrors the central relationship in its wistful vision of a failed romance, yet the mind-bending narrative is miraculously easy to follow. Charlie Kaufman, in a surprising display of affectionate writing, paints a warm mosaic of a quirky couple in quirky circumstances saying quirky things, all while keeping your heartstrings in his grip. Michel Gondry riddles the film with stunning visual effects that, depending on what you want out of the movie, either deepen its metaphorical layers of meaning or are simply really cool to look at.",

Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo was reaching the limits of punk annoyance more than anything . Kirsten Dunst plays it out commendably. For such a twisted way of showing things one must me perfect with the timing of the characters and must be dealt with more finesse . This picture is as much writing dependent as editing . The only job of the director here is to get the best out of the actors. There is nothing more to handle and that he did. So despite a quite romantic drama story outline and the subtlety of it , it is the actual scenes itself which are written with not so efficiency. As for the look of the picture it involved a lot of storytelling too and at first it might seem poor cinematography  but then you kind of realize why it is so . The shot composition and the actual photography of it was beautifully done. The ending was nicely performed and probably the sense of closure was done better with the performance of the actors and not the actual written script or the execution of it itself.So overall , a beautiful romantic drama with simple yet powerful thematic material touched upon produced for many movie going audience to linger upon.",

Though operating on a far-fetched premise, the film depicts a very real picture of how relationships are - sweet at the beginning, sour over time, and with at least one bitter casualty by the time it ends. What it ultimately asks though, is if it's worth it, taking in all the bad with the good. If the prospect of love is worth the potential disaster it'll leave in its wake.

When asked the, \"If you could change one thing...\" question, it's impossible not to relive a hundred memories that would be easier to deal with if they were different. Changing one extremely painful moment is an undeniably attractive option.\n\nThere is a second school of thought of course, the school of thought that says all of our failures and tragedies make us the people we are today. Removing even one memory would lessen or change us to our core. This mindset believes that our failures, not our successes, make us grow. This mindset is explored by Joel Barish.\n\nJoel is in love, or was in love, or is falling in love, it is never entirely clear. He meets Clementine, a woman as eccentric as her name would suggest. They form a relationship that lasts two years, but when it comes to an end, it does not resolve amicably. Both Joel and Clementine separately decide to use a firm called Lacuna to erase their memories of each other. Halfway through the process, Joel realizes that he might not want to live without the memory of Clementine.\n\nOne of the most appealing aspects of the film is the attitude with which it is brought to the screen. Directed by Michael Gondry and written by the always imaginative Charlie Kaufman, the movie walks to the beat of its own drum. There is a freshness to the filmmaking that is absolutely engrossing. Truth be told, when I watched this movie, I was running on three hours of sleep over the past thirty-six hours. And yet, I was enthralled by the story (and the storytelling) from start to finish. The film does an excellent job of keeping the audience guessing, leading to a distinct lack of watch-checking throughout.\n\nSo, I was captivated by the story, my thoughts were provoked by the message(s), but I am still partially torn on the movie. I can't bring myself to decide whether the movie simply has what it takes to be great, or if it has that little extra something to make it amazing. Is it a four star movie, or a four and a half star movie? I'm still not entirely convinced one way or the other.\n\nThe only thing preventing me from fully committing to unmitigated love for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is \"young Joel.\" There are a couple scenes in the middle of the movie that feature Jim Carrey playing a younger version of himself. Carrey's adult form is literally shrunk to child size, and the visual effect, coupled with these scenes purpose in the film, can't help but feel hokey and out-of-place. Taking these scenes out of the equation, the movie is such an infectious blend of imagination, romance, and drama. But these scenes lend the film an aspect of goofiness that feels entirely detached from the remainder of the narrative.\n\nWhether it's Jack Black in Bernie, Steve Carell in Foxcatcher, or Jim Carrey in this movie, I absolutely love being surprised by dramatic performances from comedic actors (or vice versa). Carrey's performance as Joel is, above all else, restrained. The character is a homebody, conservative, subdued, soft-spoken ... everything we have come not to expect from Jim Carrey. I was equally impressed with the actor's performance in The Truman Show, but there is a level of subtlety in Joel that I have never seen from Carrey before. Honestly, I found that I identified with Joel more than any other film character in recent memory.\n\nIn a movie starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, one would assume that Carrey would give the fun, peculiar performance. But no, it is Winslet who gets to let loose with a wonderfully unexpected turn. Kate Winslet is, perhaps, at her best when she is not restricted by the trappings of a period drama. And here, she is more uninhibited than she has ever been. The chemistry she shares with Jim Carrey never fails to bring a smile. I think the movie is so special, in part, due to the flipping of the assumed roles between Carrey and Winslet.\n\nThe supporting cast offers its own set of pleasures. The opening credits reveal that Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood all lend their talents. There is nary a weak link in the cast, with Dunst and Ruffalo sharing an especially well-acted scene near the end of the film.\n\nIf a film requires a Jon Brion-esque score, it is best to hire Jon Brion. The style of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind lends itself entirely to the composer's music. He provides a delightful little score! The very brief \"Elephant Parade\" cue is so wonderful, in the movie and out.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is poetic in the delivery of its message. It features career subversive performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. The script by Charlie Kaufman and the filmmaking by Michael Gondry is inspired, while only falling into needless eccentricity for a few brief scenes. Time will tell if I can eventually peg the film as a masterpiece. But as it stands, the movie is a delightful example of marvelous filmmaking, teetering on the edge of genius.\n\n\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!\nThe world forgetting, by the world forgot.\nEternal sunshine of the spotless mind!\nEach pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\" 8.5/10",

The beauty I find in this film is that concept that love is an uncontrollable force of it own. It can't be removed by cancelling out memories, or artificially created by constructing experiences. Clementine (Winslet) and Joel (Carey), when meeting for the second time, cannot stop the relationship from developing even though they've had a clear and depressing foreshadowing of whats to come. Mary (Kirsten Dunst) doesn't stop being in love with her married boss after wiping all memories of the relationship, and in contrast Patrick (Eilijh Wood) can't make Clem fall in love with him by recreating her relationship with Joel. \n\nIn short; love hurts and theres nothing that we can do about it, thats either depressing or liberating depending on your frame of mind.",

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, on the other hand, has no problem emitting a large quantity of danger and devastation, thanks to its entirely original and inventive screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, as well as the directorial finesse of Michael Gondry, both working together to create a romance film which not only contains a large quantity of darkness and sadness, but also speaks metaphorically about our tendencies to forget the best, and only remember the worst of our time here; to only recall those and the moments which angered or hurt us, instead of the times when we felt happy and elated.\n\nJim Carrey's emotional yet restrained performance heads a film full of greater actors and actresses, all of whom give astounding performances, with the exception of Kate Winslet, who comes off as overtly try-hard in a number of her initial scenes. Nevertheless, the romance she shares with Carrey's character, told primarily through memories, is a deeply touching and thoroughly realistic one, both of them people we can relate and care for.\n\nDespite guessing the big plot twist that occurs in the third act relatively early on during my viewing, there were a number of smart and inventive plot twists which I honestly didn't see coming. The movie twists in ways unexpected, and the execution of certain scenes, even if you predict them coming, are often so delightfully creative that you can't help but smile.

I couldn't pinpoint what it is in my mind that made me believe this as I never truly gave it any thought, but it could be because it is written by Charlie Kaufman, who didn't really impress me with his work on Spike Jonze's Adaptation even if I was a bit impressed with its ambition. This film surprised me, Kaufman has delivered a plot that may seem difficult to comprehend on paper but easy to understand on screen, the overall credit for this of course cannot only be given to the writer as this was also supported by Michel Gondry's direction and the performances from the actors. The film was able to keep my attention with its ability to deliver and draw out emotions; almost all areas of the film display some sort of genuine emotion, relying on the grace of the art of filmmaking rather than exhibit it in a conspicuous fashion. The film lets us be observers of their romance, but it takes us to a much deeper level where we get into the feelings that could only be felt when one is an unconscious state, Kaufman was clever enough to understand this as when the audience are able to break that barrier and cross to the other side, they are able to create that connection with the characters and identify with them; this concept also provided the opportunity for the director and Kaufman to sketch a story in a unique way which could also allow for repeated viewings without it feeling tiresome.\n\nThe film had me thinking repeatedly on how I would feel if I was placed in the protagonist's, Joel Barish, situation where my memory would be erased? In the middle of the process would I feel regret or would I be glad? As I am writing this, I think back in all the great and awful memories I had with certain individuals in my life, I cannot say that I regret any of it as I can understand that those experiences defined me and at certain points those people did make me happy, I wouldn't want to trade those memories away just to erase the bad ones, or else I would feel empty; which was the reason why I felt sorrowful of his memories being erased one by one.\n\nIf I had to nit-pick an issue that I had with the film's story, it would be the scene with Joel hiding under the table; this scene arrived suddenly with a slight change of tone which had me stepping back a bit. It slid from romantically dramatic to comedy without a buffer in between. \n\nThe film's photography has this ethereal hand-held third person quality to it that definitely places the audience in the appropriate mindset from the start of the film. Once we get into the procedure, the imagery becomes more intense and interesting; it shows wonderful use of set design and CGI that it becomes hard to even see the strings being pulled by the artists.\n\nThe score in this film was light and tender but still with a hint of melancholy to parallel with the fragility of the situation. It was clear that it wasn't Jon Brion's, the composer, intention to have us be manipulated into pushing out tears but rather to understand the characters and to gain a sense of feel for the atmosphere that the film is trying to capture; we are propelled into an area of the mind where reality and logic aren't the primary principles. There is a particular track that I want to praise and it's called Elephant Parade, it may be short but it is so beautiful and gentle, I haven't felt so touched by an original score since Thomas Newman's piece at the end of Road to Perdition.\n\nJim Carrey as Joel Barish was phenomenal. His performance has shown a side of me from Carrey that I never thought existed, it makes me reflect on why he now only attempts to choose slapstick comedic roles when he can demonstrate such warmth and affection to his characters. Carrey was even able to outperform Kate Winslet in this film, and she is one of those actresses that always seem to impress me in anything she involves herself in. Carrey's best scene was at the end of the film at a house on a beach, where he has an intimate scene with Winslet cherishing their moment together. Kate Winslet was great in her role as the eccentric Clementine Kruczynski. This was also a side of her I have yet seen, as I seem to always identify her as this mature and well-composed woman despite the age in the role she plays; there is this youthful quality to her that one can't help but smile at. The supportive cast were also amazing, with performances from top tier actors like Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood; their performances didn't detract from the significance from the two lead actors, and instead elevated their performances.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a rare romance that doesn't require the superficiality of love to grab your attention, its strength is found within and the film slowly draws it out to the surface for us to savour. This is definitely a film I would easily find myself coming back to in the future particularly during the stages in my life that closely resembles Joel and Clementine's joys and pains.",

            "content": "Most of this review could be seen as a spoiler, so if you haven't seen this film and don't know what happens in it, just do yourself a favor and watch it right now...I'll wait...I greatly enjoyed this movie, and the entire concept behind it. Who hasn't wished they could erase some unpleasant memories? The idea of erasing an entire person from your mind to save yourself the heart-breaking memories is just a brilliant concept for a film. Perhaps the most surprising part is, despite the fact that this is a film about the fallout from a break-up, somehow it ends up being a very romantic story. It's almost one of those films that teaches that 2 soul mates are destined to be together. The framing of the film is a nice way of adding some intrigue to the beginning, I can only imagine how puzzling that would have felt if I didn't know the premise of the movie going in. Then a massive part of the movie takes place within the mind of Joel. I love the magic of the switch that takes place in the film once Joel hits the positive memories of Clementine. The idea that he suddenly has this change of heart, but is incapable of stopping the erasure is really well-played. I love the cat-and-mouse game he then starts to play with the technicians in his own brain.\n\nJim Carrey is actually a very good actor in my opinion, and this proves he can do drama. His heart-break is so genuine, that I fully believe he is on the verge of tears. You'd think Jim Carrey as a quiet introvert would be the biggest miscast in cinema history, but I think he nails it. In fact, as an overly introverted person myself, I have to say his portrayal of Joel kind of reminds me of me. So if you're going to cast crazy Jim Carrey as an introvert, who do you cast as the wacky extrovert Clementine? Why sweet little Kate Winslet, of course. I'm not 100% sold that Winslet fully captured the impulsive craziness of Clementine, but her performance is solid. Also, having someone as charming as Winslet in the lead really helps when they make the turn and we are supposed to see why Joel wants so desperately to hold onto Clementine. Then there's the crazy cast of technicians doing the procedure. Kirsten Dunst is very good as Mary. I liked her overly kind demeanor because then the crush feel like a natural result of her personality, which makes the reveal later in the film all the more surprising. Also, she cries very convincingly which is a hard thing for many actresses to do. Tom Wilkinson was also quite good as the man behind the magic. He has a comforting demeanor, so you can see why people who live in a world like ours might be convinced by him that this far-fetched procedure was real. My big problem with the film are the 2 superfluous characters...\n\nI don't have any particular issue with Elijah Wood's or Mark Ruffalo's performance, they do good work. The problem I have is how useless their characters are to the story. I think that the purpose of Patrick's attempt to steal Joel's relationship is intended to show us that it's not what you say or do that creates love, but it is who you are. Yet I don't think they spend enough time on this sub-plot to fully develop that idea. Their relationship is just too far off on the periphery of the main story line, so it doesn't work. On the flip side, while Patrick's story is underdeveloped, Stan doesn't even have one. It's like he's only there to delay the interaction between Dr. Mierzwiak and Mary. He should have been written out of the film because he served no purpose. However including some extra characters that add annoyance instead of more interesting stories doesn't hurt Eternal Sunshine that much. It is still a brilliantly told story. The effects of slowly erasing the memories is so perfectly done. I love how, at first, we see minor things erasing and then slowly entire structures are disintegrating and peoples' faces are being wiped away. They use so many interesting methods: from simple darkness fading things out of our view, to blurring, and even CGI dismantling of things one board at a time. Despite some minor complaints, I found this to be an excellent film, and one I'll enjoy watching again to see what little details I missed the first time.",

Mixing elements of drama and fantasy, the film is a refreshing take on your traditional romantic film, and it delivers something totally different. I really enjoyed the film's path on how they handled the material, and Carrey delivers the performance of his career with this one. Since Jim Carrey is known for comedic work, this is a film that proves he is able to act in other genres of film. With this film, he breaks new ground in his career, and definitely makes the film that much better. The story itself is well thought out, and the direction is great as well. This is a terrific, entertaining picture that delivers an engaging two hours of solid entertainment. If you're looking for a well constructed drama that is original and not just another rehash, then this is the film watch. I honestly didn't expect much from this film, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The film might surprise skeptics, and it most certainly impressed me. I thought that this ranked as one of Jim Carrey's best, and it was nice to see him take on a more dramatic role as well. To me, it's always interesting to see comedy actors take on serious roles as we don't know what to expect, and in the case of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, we get a   surprising, well delivered performance from Jim Carrey that compliments a wonderful story.",

Kate winslet is someone whose roles are usually very similar. By looking at the script, one might not be fond of the idea that Winslet should lay a young, enrgetic and somewhat bizarre woman. But Winslet fits her role perfectly, so much so that seeing another actress play the character is as good as impossible. \n\nWhile it is a depressive story in its way, it also has its comic relief which luckily does not derive or ruin the general tone of th film in any way. The ending is one of those that in some ways may satisfy some people and utterly diasppoint and confuse others.

In this movie there is an experimental procedure run by a doctor (Tom Wilkinson) which can erase memory of one object in someone mind by fancy device.it`s causing the movie has a fantasy genre because as long we know there is nobody can do this practic exactly like in this movie. and then the best way you get the idea of meaning is with 4 steps. step 1, Joel (Carrey) met girl named Naomi which never appear in this movie. step 2, Joel met Clementine (Winslet) in beach with all his friends, but this scene never exactly appear in this movie. step 3, Clementine erased her memory with Joel at first time. step 4, Joel erased his memory about Clementine after he know she erased him. this erasing memory activity held on his room by Stan (Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood). and then the system is failed out,because Joel struggling to remember Clementine in the process. because his struggling there is a true memory blend with his fake imagination of Clementine in the process. that`s why sometime we see Clementine during the process for example there is a scene when they first time met in the beach, but this isn`t the original one,this memory in the beach has blend with his fake imagination. step 5, they met again in train by accidentally.

Carrey is much more subdued than normal, which is nice, but it's really Gondry and Kaufman's surreal vision about dealing with emotional pain that makes this movie so memorable. There are quite a few films that dip into the surreal for the sake of style, but this is one that does it in a way that serves character, story and theme. For anyone unfamiliar with the film, it's about Carrey going through an emotional breakup with girlfriend Kate Winslet and then deciding to have his memories medically erased. From there is where the film begins to get really interesting.",

It was the final piece to watch (and read, we had to read the screenplay as well). Boyfriend adores this movie, so he had no issue watching this with me for homework.\n\nMr. Kaufman and Mr. Gondry are geniuses. This was a brilliant film and I'm so glad its finally getting some major appreciation, because when it first came out no one had even heard of this movie. I wasn't allowed to watch it when it did come out do the R rating. Sighs. However, the wait for worth it. It's such a good movie. It's so heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time. It makes you really realize that the bad memories are bad, but they are worth it, because of the good memories. You can't have the good without the bad. The bad makes you appreciate the good memories even more. A certain song comes to mind as a I write this review, \"Daylight\" by Maroon 5. \n\nIt fits the movie pretty darn well.\n\nBut the plotting was amazing. Mr. Kaufman took the A-typical boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl-but-boy-wins-girl-back story and made it something seriously different and original. A hint to watching this movie...look at Clem's hair. Her hair helps you piece together what scene belongs where. It's all scrambled up, but by the end everything makes sense. \n\nThe actors were great. It was such a good cast with such big names. How the hell did this not get an Oscar? Really? But, yes, they all did wonderful. The chemistry between Clem and Joel was good. The dialogue was brilliant. \n\nI really could go on and on about this film, but I shall stop my ramblings. \n\nIn the end, I simple adore this film. It is a brilliant and amazing film. The actors were fantastic and the plotting device perfect to sharing this story. I loved the ending. It was perfect as well. I would recommend this to those who love romances, but with a twist. This is not just a love story, but its a human story. There is a major lesson that should be learned from watching this. I have many bad memories myself, but I would never erase them, because they allow me to be who I am and it allows me to appreciate the good memories even more. Out of 5 stars I shall stamp this with 5 stars. ^.^\n\nFavorite Character(s): Joel, Clem, Stan, and Mary\nNot-so Favorite Character(s): Patrick (I love the actor, but his character was a creeper and a pervert.

First thing's first, the subplot of the people erasing Joel's memories was unnecessary, I didn't not care about them except for Patrick who tried to steal Clementine from Joel was significant. I loved the unconventional storytelling and the opening credit being placed after 10 minutes of the film has started and then the film became a flashback of what has happened to the protagonists. The performance was admirable, I was surprised by how well Kate Winslet handled her role even though I could see Drew Barrymore play it better.

            "content": "With a terrific premise this easily makes this my favorite Jim Carey film to date. This is the story of Joel and Clementine.  They are the classic mismatched couple.  He's reserved, she's wild and outrageous. The two of them have gone through a bad breakup and Clementine has gone and had all memories of Joel removed from her brain because she can no longer stand him. The procedure is done by a local doctor who specializes in the removal of painful memories.  When Joel finds this out he decides to erase her back, mainly out of bitterness.  But then in the middle of the procedure he changes his mind and does everything he can think of to hold onto the memories of Clementine even as they are being completely deleted from his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe casting in the film is interesting  Jim Carrey plays the quiet and reserved character of Joel and conceals his manic tendencies flawlessly.  Kate Winslet on the other hand is allowed to run wild with the unconventional character of Clementine.  It works wonderfully and the two have a very real and earned chemistry.  It's important to the story that we can not only see them work together but we can see why they broke apart and it's all there up on the screen.  They are backed up by a very solid cast  Kirsten Dunst is the slightly flakey secretary with a crush on the doctor in charge of the procedure.  Tom Wilkinson in the doctor role is nicely understated and much more vulnerable than these sorts of roles tend to be.  Elijah Wood's role as a mischievous little scumbag plays nicely against his innocent look.  The only cast member really doing his standard routine is Mark Ruffalo playing the slightly awkward sort of character he that he has played on a few occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie easily could have leapt into the realm of sci-fi movies like Total Recall with elaborate devices and what is reality type twists.  But rather than walk that very well  used path, Kaufman and Gondry take the low-tech approach.  The machine used to wipe Joel's memory looks like somebody put it together in a garage it wasn't very high tech looking at all.  And while the story does toy with reality from Joel's perspective it's never played as a trick on the audience.  Joel's mind (where a large part of the film is set) is mainly just him wandering through his own memories rather than some sort of elaborate fantasy world.  In fact Gondry uses the simplest possible visuals to relay ideas rather than dipping into the well of crazy images.  It keeps the concept from taking over the story and allows it to be all about the characters.  It also touches lightly on the question of whether or not we, and the connections we have with people, are more than just the sum of our memories.  It's a rather deep concept and the movie does have its point of view on the matter but this point is not constantly in your face.  In fact it's never even spoken about directly by the characters, but it's a notion that underlies much of the movie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt can take a little time to really accept the movie on its own terms just because it bucks so many of the ideas the audience would already have about a movie dealing with memory loss.  Also it does take some time for the story to really kick in and feel like it's going somewhere, though by the end it is clear why the movie had to start the way it does.  This makes the first 20 minutes or so work in hindsight if not completely successful upon the initial viewing.  The film comes together as a delightful way to tell a love story with a sci-fi twist.",

Jim Carrey stars as Joel Barish, a man who is informed that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their relationship erased from her brain via an experimental procedure performed by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). Not to be outdone, Joel decides to have the same procedure done to himself. As Mierzwiak's bumbling underlings Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) perform the operation on Joel -- over the course of an evening, in his apartment -- Joel struggles in his own mind to save the memories of Clementine from being deleted. Kirsten Dunst, David Cross, and Jane Adams also star. ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi\nMy Review\nMary:How happy is the blameless vessel flout,the world forgetting by the world forgotten Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,each prayer accepted,each wish resigned. This feel good heartfelt love story revolves around a guy named Joel meeting a woman named Clementine played Kate Winslet who he feels has forgotten her but then reunites with her after trying to forget about her. During one scene while Joel is given the treatment of losing his memory's of her he quotes \"Please just let me keep this one\" I honestly feel that their could have been a moral about good and bad memory's such as every memory with love and relationships must be kept the good and even bad. The acting is just blessid from all the actors in this film. But Jim Carry's character Joel is the one you feel the most for in this film. Joel seems so depressed in those small scenes of sadness i felt like i was watching myself. The Cinematography is well done. This film is a true love story and a masterpiece and a film that should not be forgotten. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind gets a 5 out of 5.",

The movie walks the fine line of cinematic time jumping very well, without the annoying feeling that the movie is \"playing you\" like other films.  There is such a genuiness in Carrey's character, in an inward and honest way while Winslett's character was almost the antithesis personality-wise.  The interactions between Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Tom Wilkinson are definitely of intrigue as well.  Nice bit of surreal moviemaking with brings forth a lot of questions about realationship interaction.",

            "content": "thought this movie was great. I don't hand out 5 stars easily. At first glance, I thought this movie was going to be another \"Groundhog Day\" (1993), where Jim Carrey would be reprising his comedic character from back in the days of \"The Mask\" (1994) and \"Dumb and Dumber\" (1995), but this would not be the case. Carrey plays a more serious role as in \"Man in the Moon\" (1999) and later in \"The Number 23\" (2007). Ok, so it helps that I'm a fan of Jim Carrey's work, but the imaginative story, which won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, is amazing. It is like \"Total Recall\" (1990) in reverse, where instead of trying to add memories that never occurred, this movie toys with a procedure that can erase your memory of a given individual. Carrey's character Joel is undergoing this procedure, but decides partway through that he wants out. Since the procedure takes place in a comatose state, this is not an option. This causes the majority of the movie to take place in a dreamlike sequence. Much like a dream, events superimpose themselves, and passing through familiar doorways lead to illogical places. There was no predicting what would happen next because anything could happen next. And then when Joel decides he wants out, it becomes like being in a dream that you know you are dreaming. This is what \"Nightmare on Elm Street\"(1984) would be like if it were simply \"Dream on Elm Street.\" Then to add to an already dizzying tale, halfway through the movie an unexpected twist occurs in a sub-plot that you are unaware even exists outside the dream sequence. The movie explores themes such as, of course, memory, true love and destiny. I thought the editing was fantastic, and am surprised to see it did not garner much attention. Fortunately it was recognized by fellow editors, it received a nomination at the American Cinema Editors awards. A great movie to watch,--it's different, it's philosophical, it's fun, and it's entertaining. What more can you ask for in a movie?",

            "content": "The movie had an intriguing start for me, especially since going into it I just knew a lot of people had liked the movie (and Jim Carrey's performance) but I had never gotten around to seeing it, so I had no idea what to expect except to expect something good, and boy was this good. While I did end up predicting how it was going to end a little less than halfway through the movie that doesn't mean it was anything near predictable, in fact it was very original, I just typically pick up on things very quickly in movies (I was able to fully understand Inception in one viewing fairly easily. In fact Inception did nothing to work my mind at all, although I find that a bad example because I still to this day don't see how Inception blows anybodies mind.) So I will say this movie blew my mind (for a little bit) when it clicked in my brain what was happening at that midway point in the movie. Although I will say that made the movie a tad bit less enjoyable after I already figured out how it was going to end, but that's not the movie's fault. \r\n\r\nIf I was going to compare this movie to anything it would probably end up being, The Truman Show, it was another Jim Carrey movie where he played a much more serious role with a very unique and intriguing script (which Truman Show completely blew my mind when I saw it, btw, but then again I was much younger. And when I re-watched it today it showed a whole lot more relevancy to today's times and how far ahead of it's time it was, although that's for a different review) and they both have great quality. Also the overall gist of the story is very similar in terms of Jim Carrey's character's (Joel) motive in ESoaSM and Truman Show when it comes to holding on to that girl. Although, i'll stop comparing them now because it would make this sound like a re-hash of the Truman Show and it is in no way that, I was just pointing out a lot of the similarities, and those are good similarities to have when it comes to this movie. \r\n\r\nNow, onto the performances in the movie, Jim Carrey did a fantastic job as that slightly awkward quiet guy and was very relatable, and you see so much progression of his character (even when the majority of the movie takes place inside his own mind). Kate Winslet, who played the romantic counterpart to Carrey, did a fine job as well and was also very believable but I won't commend it as much because she had a much easier role to play than Carrey (even if her character arguably had more personality than Carrey's). Kirsten Dunst, while at first didn't seem all to noticeable had a big part within the movie and she did fine as well, although if I had to point to one character being the least believable out of any of them it'd be her's, she just didn't exactly get the character as well as she could have. Tom Wilkinson, whose role was small but important, did good for the scenes he was in. I can say for the character's that weren't Jim Carrey's or Kate Winslet the best performances came out of Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo, they did a great job at their role's, believable, and for Elijah Wood's completely despicable at certain points in the movie (although the script didn't spend much time dwelling on it, but it was gut-wrenching watching it when it did happen.) \r\n\r\nNow onto probably the best part of the movie, and that is the great direction and fantastic screenplay which mixed fantastically with the subtle score (which, although at points would be abrupt, was chilling and completely captured the tone). There were so many moments of brilliance (and probably my favorite two were the \"quote scene\" and the \"house scene\" near the end, which people who have seen at will get without giving them away) within the film and it did a good job balancing the lighter stuff with the deeper sections, although the deeper sections were always what were memorable, some of the lighter stuff felt a bit forced at times as if it were only there to satisfy the rom-com crowd (but only slightly and briefly). There are so many intriguing looks into the human memory and has great commentary on how when you wish something would go away you aren't really realizing what you are truly realizing. There were many parts where the script, direction, cinematography, performances, and track all worked so perfectly together and it brought tears in my eyes, the scenes were beautiful and my actual biggest gripe is about these scenes in that they didn't stretch them out long enough, they felt like they ended abruptly at times (I get the point behind this though) and the lighter sections again felt like tonal off-balance compared to these. My last gripe is about the ending in not that it wasn't a great ending but that I wish it could have ended a bit more ambiguously. I'll end my review with my favorite quote from the film (that was a quote quoted in the film), \"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. \r\nEternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;\". 9.5/10 for Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.",

            "content": "Not one to enjoy romances, I went into Eternal Sunshine apprehensively-- and I recommend it the same way-- but it's a pleasant, genuine, and legitimately lovable film that capably pulls the audience into the world it has created. Sure, it's a schmaltzy movie that's definitely got love as one of its main themes, but among those themes are people's interactions, shyness, how the mind works, and memories. It's a very nostalgic film (which I have to fault it for), but it's undoubtedly one of the most watchable romances I've ever seen. \r\n\r\nETOTSP is about a man (Jim Carrey) whose ex-girlfriend (Kate Winslet) gets a medical procedure to wipe her mind of all memories of him, so he does the same. I cannot find a problem with the premise, as it's one of the most original takes on a typically repetitive genre that you can find. I could probably pick apart some logical inconsistencies (when their minds are erased, how do they erase single memories? Are there just gaps that they can't go back to? All memories are interconnected), but I'm going to do something completely out of character and not be a stickler for plot holes (even though there are several). Like... wouldn't the people notice after a while that they had enormous swaths of their memories missing? Fuck it, I didn't tear Total Recall apart, so I won't do it to this either.\r\n\r\nAlthough reading the synopsis might make you think otherwise, most of the film is spent on the procedure itself, and Carrey's memories about Winslet and them being erased. It's a very entertaining and moving series of scenes, and the way the memories blend into each other is definitely one of the visual feats of the century. Although I had some problems when it came to the scenes outside of his mind (featuring Kirsten Dunst's 'acting'), it held up well enough to be highly enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI do love it when a movie comes full circle like it does in ESOTSM-- but unfortunately, I don't want to spoil the ending, so I can't rant about how much I enjoyed it. But I will say this-- no matter how the rest of the movie was, the end of it can really make or break the rest of the film. Salmon Fucking on the Yemen could have been just mediocre, but the last 20 minutes merited a 2/10. The conclusion to Return of the King basically destroyed the rest of the film. But at the other end of the spectrum, you have a movie like this: It starts out slow, but builds up and up and up until it finally peaks... just before you hit the end credits. This leaves the audience wanting more, and is a very powerful filmmaking tool.\r\n\r\nCarrey is unexpectedly good as the star of the show, leading me to believe that he might actually be better as a serious and darkly comic actor than the bombastic nutball he usually plays. Winslet, meanwhile, was my favorite part of the movie, as she completely embodied her role as an impulsive, thrill-seeking, hair color-changing girl who doesn't really know what she wants out of life. Unlike the typical romance, it actually got me to root for the main characters and hope that they would end up together, which is a feat that few films can accomplish.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Eternal Sunshine: 7/10 stars. It loses something to the lightweight and undemanding foundation it's built on, but really, it's what it does with its flimsy premise that counts. It features spellbinding performances, agreeable dialogue, some interesting subplots, and some genuinely funny moments. This is the thinking man's romantic comedy, in that it's not too much of either. Although it often tries to be far deeper than it really is, it still deserves the recognition it has gotten for being one of Carrey's best movies.",

            "content": "ETERNAL SUNSHINE's narrative is essentially a love story told backwards. It deals with the traditional problem of reverse narrative in a new way. The traditional problem is that if the audience already knows the ending (bitter breakup), then telling the story in reverse asks the audience the question of \"is it worth it?\" as we watch the story back to the beginning (falling in love). This intellectualizes the experience rather than giving us dramatic action. ETERNAL SUNSHINE deals with this problem of intellectualization by giving the protagonist an active role in the reverse narrative. Joel is able to interact with his old memories to try to stop the process of erasing; this attempt to escape is the major sub-plot of the film. The catharsis of the audience comes with his rediscovery of his love for Clementine as they try to escape together. They fail to escape at the climax of this sub-plot and his memory is erased. But the lovers meet again by fate and once again fall in love. This fake climax of the main love-story plot is placed at the beginning of the film and again at the end of the film - the audience realizes the despite losing all their memory, the lovers meet and fall in love again. If the film ended there, it would have been a good film, and the central idea would have been \"Love happens because of fate\". But the problem would have been that Joel went through this huge journey of discovery and change but that all seems to go to waste if fate was just going to put them together again - he needs to be the one making an active choice that demonstrates his internal change at climax. The real climax of ETERNAL SUNSHINE comes out of the reversal at the end, in which the Joel and Clementine discover their bitter past and must choose whether or not to commit despite their past. This resurfaces Joel's inner journey. He and she choose to commit, completing Joel's journey of internal change with an external action. The central idea now becomes \"Love happens because of fate but it will only result in a happy relationship with open acceptance of each other and the painful compromises that come with love\". This real climax fueled by true character change, dilemma and choice is what makes the film great. The climax completes the audience catharsis experienced through Joel's rediscovery of love; as a result he wins the girl and we are touched by a great story.\n\n http://www.storycharts.ca/pages/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind",

After a rough relationship, Joel finds out Clementine erased Joel from her mind by a professional company. Realizing this, he decides to do the same about her love. However, is it possible to erase all the cherished memories, and if it is, would you want to erase them? While the plot centers around WInslet and Carrey, director Gondry does a great job at providing interesting sub-plots with strong supportive characters. Gondry is almost as if trying to express the look at relationships and heartache in a creative yet mind-puzzling way. The soundtrack and imagery are very powerful inflicting an emotional response. Overall it's an amazing movie that requires a lot of thought from the audience and down right one of Carrey's best performances. This film gets a 9/10/",

Sometimes I love a movie during my first viewing on a very basic entertainment level, the second time I am usually looking for something a little more. I liked Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the first time, but I really didn't remember much about it. This was a few years ago, before film school and before I really came a student of the films themselves. It was the second viewing of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in my New Media Film class that I fell in love with it.\n\nThis movie can be viewed on an entertainment level. Tt can be studied for its visual splendor, its attention to character, and story. It is absolutely a magnificent film, that I will have to watch every couple of years or so, because I am sure I will get something else out of it with each experience. You know a movie succeeds when each viewing creates a new experience and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind does this. I can see myself watching this when I am out of college, being married, having kids, and still see something I never got from it before.\n\nVisuals: The in camera effects here are amazing. The pacing in editing is practically perfect. The characters costumes are so well thought out.\n10/10\n\nActing: Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are perfect. I also really enjoyed Mark Ruffalo. He was allot of fun. JIm Carrey's character develops convincingly.\n 10/10\n\nStory: A perfect love story, with a bit of science fiction. The dialogue is fresh and entertaining. So much to feed off of, in terms of subtext.\n 10/10\n\nConcept: The concept of erasing a person completely from memory gives it a 10/10 alone.\n 10/10\n\nPersonal: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is super entertaining and I learned allot from it. Maybe didn't hit home on some levels, but I am sure it will in the future.\n 9/10\n\nRe-Watchability: There are so many reasons to revisit this movie, but I have already touched on that in my introduction.\n 10/10\n\n9.8/10",

The editing in this movie is absolutely fantastic and the way it shifts to scene to scene is just great. Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey are stunning in this film, they have great chemistry and make an odd but lovable pair. The supporting characters are also great, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson are also fantastic. The script is funny, its hard pounding, and touching.

Well, I decided to look at some of his other work, and so I came across Eternal Sunshine, which is, in my opinion, one of the best romance movies made. Why? Well, the characters, all of them, are extremely interesting and investing, though Jim Carrey (whose performance is spectacular) and Kate Winslet are standouts. As for the screenplay, well, like Malkovich, the screenplay takes normality and adds, mainly, one specific quirk (in this case, a group that can literally erase memories) that is extremely interesting, especially in its execution, giving it detail, control, and somehow, seemingly all logical, as if this all makes sense. Then we also have Michel Gondry directing, who I also really enjoy as a director, who has a way with doing interesting direction and really cool takes on a certain story. His work here is also dynamo, with great imagery and excellent shots throughout. You really get invested in the main couple, though they are memories for 90% of the film, and you want everything to work out as best as possible, and there is such a cool twist at the end that I really love. As someone who doesn't find romance movies that interesting, I think this one stands out as one of my personal favorites.",

I cried a bit in the middle, but the montage sequence in the ending, just totally did it for me. First of all, being able to relate to the main character helps, a lot. Secondly, watching a man trying to del- oh wait, if I go any further, I will most likely spoil the movie, so yeah. Jim Carreys performance is just astounding. I really didn't think he was capable of such naturalism. Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, etc are all great as well. The best thing about this movie is the fact that it's pure experimentation at it's best...heck, it's art, at it's best. I loved how despite how depressing the movie gets, there is this light hearted comedy throughout, with the usage of music and script, perfectly. There is also just so much the film has in it, that I have to give it a re-watch to clearly grasp it all. The themes the film goes through, like questioning the ethics of using science to destroy love, is it really healthy to live with the memory of someone you loved but doesn't love you back, etc. Oh man. The best way to describe this movie is: tragically beautiful. The ending was just...perfect. I was totally satisfied with it. It's as real as real can be. I'll add in that this film also basically made me appreciate the one I love so much more than ever. Anyways, yeah...this is definitely among the best movies I've seen.",

            "content": "Michael Gondry is a highly stylized director, sort of the like the early Tim Burton but with a plushy, crafts class aesthetic heavily mixed in.  He is deliberately kitschy in a unique way that fits the quirky demeanor of his characters and the fantastical scenarios they find themselves in.  Those characters and scenarios come courtesy of the highly original, Oscar-winning screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, continuing his streak of extreme originality, originality that benefits from a willingness to dare what anyone sensible person would not.  \nThe story is of a relationship between a nebbish man (Jim Carrey) and an impulsive woman (Kate Winslet), but after a fight, she has the memory of him erased from her mind, and he follows suit, but in the process, he begins to regret it, fighting against the procedure in his mind.  This story is told non-linearly and like the best nonlinear stories, it becomes a wildly fun game of keeping up and connecting the pieces.  With the pre-established structure and revelations in mind, repeat viewings have much ready to offer as well.\nJim Carrey has had some very funny comedic performance in THE MASK and LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, but he's never been much of an actor.  He has a tendency to mug clownishly and his performances are usually lacking in sincerity.  But not this time.  Here, even with his comedic sequences, he finally shows a real performance with finesse and authenticity.  In one of the most odd matches of movie couples, he shows great chemistry with Kate Winslet, and hers is very fun to watch as she plays an impulsive, loud, irritable and quirky archetype of a bookstore girl, and it is quite far from anything else she's done.  \nETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is not for everyone.  It's incredibly bizarre, and for some, maybe offputting even.  As Carrey and Winslet race through his mind from the memory erasers, there are plenty of oddities, including erased memories with faceless personages, and a very funny but strange childhood memory where Winslet becomes Carrey's mother's friend, and Carrey as his child-sized self.\nMost surprisingly though is how it all works.  The story is happening on many levels; the memory erasing process that takes us through the central relationship in reverse, the dysfunctional relationships between the operators performing the procedure on Carrey from outside his mind, and the reuniting of persons even after the memories are gone; and yet, even as it's all blended together, the flow is consistent, clear and gripping.",

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a true gem in terms of writing, editing, performance, and presentation, with a daringly original concept that is executed brilliantly, and leaves you with an ending so satisfying you won't know what hit you until it's over.",

Also, taking into account this and her performance in The Reader, Kate Winslet is as good an actress as there is. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, especially Elijah Wood, surprisingly adept as the unlikeable, manipulative creep.\r\n\r\nThis film is thought-provoking, I believe primarily for critics and film insiders. I just didn't enjoy it. Here's a key statement: \"I wish I'd stayed, I wish I'd done a lot of things.\" He's got regrets, so do we all. As painful as life's memories can be, I'm glad I have them.

I think that because of the 2nd line \"The world forgetting, by the world forgot.\"  The first line in the poem is almost like Chinese to me.  I think it is questioning how happy certain people are with the things they remember or forget.  That poem was sited by Kirsten Dunst in this film, and was used as inspiration for the film.\n\nJoel (Jim Carrey) decides to have his ex girlfriend Penelope (Kate Winslet) erased from his mind, because he knows that she erased him from her mind.  The film really messes with your mind as they mess with Joel's mind.  In this crazy movie they go into his mind and erase all of his memories of Penelope one by one, but in his mind he decides that he wants to call the whole thing off, and he starts running throughout his entire mind with Penelope trying to stop the whole thing, and wake himself up.  The film is so interesting, crazy, weird, and great.  It is not as much of a comedy as a fantasy film.  Most of the film takes place in his mind as his memories are being erased.  He goes back to being a child in his mind, and I can't really even explain it.  It is a tough film to review, because it's elements are hard to explain, but that is good because I won't be able to give a lot of information on it, and you will have to see it to understand how complex the film is.  It will demand a second viewing because I am still not sure of certain things.\n\nHis memories with her are a lot of fighting and they show how depressed he was and how she got frustrated with him.  He has a lot of happy moments with her, and moments where they look like a clich\u00e9d struggling couple that just seemed bored of each other.  They are both polar opposites actually.  Penelope has a lot more positivity, while Joel is dull and negative.  Penelope dies her hair in many different wild colors, and that was a directorial thing to show how much more of a colorful and interesting person she is.  He figures out a lot as he is running around his dream trying to save her from erased from his mind.  He met her after breaking up with a woman named \"Naomi.\"  The beginning will connect to the end, and the film is just mind bending.  I found it confusing after the mind erasing was done actually, more so as to when they were doing the job.\n\nThe film has some really good acting from Jim Carrey, and Kate Winslet.  It was an unusual role for Jim Carrey, because he wasn't that silly.  Kate Winslet played a very eccentric character that was definitely more interesting then Jim Carrey's character.  The film has incredible directing from Michael Gondry, and phenomenal screenplay writing from Charlie Kauffman.  Charlie Kauffman sure is a creative and weird genius.  He hasn't written many movies but the ones he does write seem to be great.  I can't wait to see what ever he comes up with next.  This was a fantastic movie that was a true masterpiece, and purely genius.  Absolutely brilliant!!!",

He signs up for a procedure to erase his memories of her and halfway through he realizes he wants to hold on. As psychological as it is gripping, it makes us, as an audience, look within ourselves and wonder whether or not we'd give up our own memories. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have amazing chemistry and you find yourself rooting for them to win their game of mental hide and seek. The world of memories is intriguing and sometimes a little disturbing but it gets the point across in a unique way. It takes the idea of the original love story and skews the timeline and universe, giving us a fresh look on a worn out narrative. The film itself is as unforgettable as Clementine is to Joel. Give it a watch. You won't regret it.",

That being said this movie was so amazing that it moved me to write a review after 22 months since I last wrote one. \n\nI had already seen Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind a couple years back when I was in high school. It was my brothers favorite movie at the time and I watched it after much encouragement from him. Needless to say I was less than impressed, I thought the movie dragged on and was dull. BUT I came across the movie today on Instant Netflix when I was scouring the site for something to watch on the treadmill. I fell in love with the story of Joel and Clementine as I walked three miles.\n\nI have really been through a lot with relationships since my first viewing of the film and I needed that maturity to truly understand what the characters were going through. The love story in ESSM is not some over the top drawn out ordeal (like you usually see in Hollywood), it's an everyday common type of love between two everyday common type of people. It is something that is easy to relate to and will bring up feelings. \n\nI give this movie the highest possible rating I can: 10/10 or 5 fives stars.\nAny movie that can make me a fan of a love story must really be good. I encourage whoever is reading this to get up and go watch it.\n\n-Swander57\n1/4/13",
