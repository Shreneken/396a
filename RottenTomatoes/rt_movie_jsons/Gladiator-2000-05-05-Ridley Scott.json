The plot is really fun, and the movie is loosely based on real events, and disregarding that and a few tactical errors, it is apparently pretty accurate at representing Rome according to several Roman history professors that have spent decades on the subject.

Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "The big screen Roman Epic comes roaring back to life in Ridley Scott's rousing film. Scott has few peers when it comes to bringing scale and scope to a movie, and this is some of his finest work. It's a brilliant mix of superb production design (costumes, art direction, sets) and immersive location shooting in Morocco, Italy, and the UK. Special effects fill in the gaps and help sell us on the spectacular sights of the vast reach of the Roman Empire. Russell Crowe is a riveting center to this, anchoring the film in his stoic presence and battlefield credibility (he looks perfectly at-home on a horse). Joaquin Phoenix brings shades of gray to his impetuous ruler, an emperor-with-no-clothes hiding his cowardice behind a veil ruthless ambition and populism. Connie Nielsen does well as a woman navigating a complex situation, simultaneously working to appease, flatter and placate her at times incestuous mad king brother, while carefully threading the needle to what may be an attempted coup. The late Oliver Reed brought a touch of the grand to his role, Djimon Honsou is solid support, and David Hemmings had the theatrical voice and over-the-top eyebrows to embody the master of ceremonies of the gladiator matches. Those fights--complete with chariots, horses, and even tigers, taking place in the grand Colosseum--and the battlefield scenes are brutal blurs of grim beauty, bringing the immediacy and savagery of up-close combat to vivid life. The films loses some steam in the palace and political intrigues, and as history this is just hooey, despite all the attention to detail. And ultimately, the plot boils down to a revenge tale. While it may not reach the cinematic heights of epic filmmaking, a la David Lean or John Ford, Scott still puts on a hell of a show, a grand cinematic spectacle that demands to be seen and experienced on the big screen",

Russel Crowe's acting is top notch, you begin seeing his character as a real human rather than a fictional character, the same should be said about Joaquin phoenix, whose villain is incredible. The Cinematography and soundtrack are really beautiful making the movie a joy to watch over and over again. The fighting scenes are well-done and perfectly reflect the brutality of those times of human's history. The story may not be special according to some people and even have some goofy moments. but it is told in such a brilliant way, that for me is one of the best. For me this movie is one of the highest points in cinema history and it deserves to be called a masterpiece!",

The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent.

Considering the historical reality of the brutal politics of ancient Rome, on a rewatch I found the ending a bit too \"Hollywood\", with everything being resolved and a nice bow placed on top. But still, this is meant to be a completely fictional story (although placed in a semi-accurate historical setting, with fictional versions of some historical figures), so I can't get too upset at any inconsistencies with reality. It feels more inspired by mythology and the swords and sandals epics of the 50's & 60's, then it is by any historical commitment.",

            "content": "Gladiator is the epic story of a general who is enslaved and forced to fight in the Coliseum in a low fantasy world loosely based on the Roman Empire. Jokes about the complete lack of historical accuracy aside, Gladiator has some strong points - Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) makes for a decent villain, the camerawork is strong, and the action, while occasionally spoiled by the dated slow-motion effects, is satisfying. Unfortunately, the screenplay is entirely unbefitting a Best Picture winner. It is full of pseudo-profundities and is unnecessarily depressing, fridging the main character's family almost immediately in the most horrific way possible. Worse, the awful events Maximus experiences provoke little character development beyond making him a bit bitter. He is not the only one with vague characterization: the screenplay provides little in the way of coherent character motivations for the actors (save perhaps Phoenix) to work with, and perhaps consequently, almost every line is delivered like a speech or soliloquy even when this is inappropriate for the context. Gladiator is an alright film if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy the sights, but critics often present the film as intellectually-engaging art, a modern Spartacus, which it most definitely is not.",

I hadn't seen Gladiator for seventeen years, and I've wondered for a long time whether I would hold it in the same high regard I did as a fourteen year old. Especially as the last Ridley Scott film I saw was another of his historical epics, the directors cut of Kingdom Of Heaven (2005), which was boring bordering on insulting. Orlando Bloom sank the film like one of the many boulders falling to the ground in the films' action sequences, which served as a far too infrequent alarm clock for me throughout its seeming three day run time. Gladiator, thankfully, is every bit as impressive the second time round. Ridley Scott has always been a fabulous world builder, (that includes Kingdom Of Heaven) and his vision of Rome is staggering. Russell Crowe can be a figure of ridicule at times, but is on mellowed, low key, Oscar winning form here, and he is terrific. It's not often that a film with so many action fight sequences can hold you on the edge of your seat for all of them, but Gladiator achieves this in spades, and is genuinely thrilling. Joaquin Phoenix is pitifully creepy and superbly effective as the villainous Commodus, and Connie Nielsen provides excellent support, alongside the late Richard Harris in a small role. Apart from perhaps The Martian (2015), it's a long time since Scott has been on top form, and Gladiator reminds you of how good he can be.",

            "content": "A massive project with Ridley Scott's revival of the Sword & Sandal genre with Gladiator. This was Ridley Scott at the start of the digital age and his first colossal success since Thelma and Louise. Even then it managed to top that. It carried expectations with its overall marketing, starring one of the biggest stars in the world at that point Russell Crowe and would be the first of a handful of collaborations between Crowe and Scott. Pretty much putting Scott back on form after several financial misfires.\n\nAt the height of the Roman Empire under the rule of Marcus Aurelius, his general Maximus, played by Crowe, leads his army to conquer and secure the nation of Germania with great success. Emperor Aurelius, nearing the end of his life, believes the political state of Rome has been corrupted. Primarily by morally backwards senators and his own son and heir to be, Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix. Aurelius entrusts Maximus with leading the city of Rome because of his loyalty, but Maximus instead seeks to return to his family after time in battle.\n\nCommodus gets wind of this and in his madness becomes upset and kills Aurelius in an embrace and frames Maximus for the crime \u2013 sentencing him to be executed. Maximus escapes with his life and rides to find his family brutally murdered by Commodus's men. Left bereft, his wounded self is captured by slave traders. Who sell him to a head gladiator trainer, Proximus played by Oliver Reed who reluctantly trains him to survive in the Gladiator Arena. Proving himself popular with the crowd, they move to the colosseum in Rome where the now Commodus reins emperor to little appeal amongst the senators. Maximus confronts Commodus in the arena and declares he will use what he can to avenge his family, no matter what.\n\nEven with the first scene of the battle to conquer Germania, you can get a real feeling of what you're in for. The sequence alone has plenty of sword cleaving, heads rolling, plenty of Braveheart-esque action that it's hard to look away. All the battle sequences - whether here or in the arena are particularly brutal. Choreographed in a way that genuinely makes them authentic and genuine of the period.\n\nBacked by the spectacle on-screen is a barnstorming central performance from Russell Crowe. Who really made his name across the world with this film and clearly seeks to take centre stage amongst the rest of the cast and the drama unfolding. With Joaquin Phoenix playing the central antagonist as effectively foolhardy. He plays him as the most exceptional combination of mad and pathetic that I ever have seen and for that, it's entertaining. The film went through several re-writes and production problems, and because of that, the film is far from perfect.\n\nThere is the dialogue in this film such as the trailer line from earlier like, \"Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my revenge, in this life or the next\" or \"There was a dream that was Rome. It shall be released\" that I can't tell if they're genius or plain silly \u2013 so I'm settling for both. There are notably CGI inputs within the film. Clearly, are added due to time or unfortunate circumstances that occurred during the production such as Oliver Reed's untimely death halfway through shooting or the remodelling of the Coliseum.\n\nWith that and Reed's computer-generated death scene, it stands out as jarring. There is a lot of Roman political discussions behind the scenes and does get bogged down with the major plot with Maximus and his revenge. There is a subplot involving Derek Jacobi's senator Gracchus who wants to overthrow Commodus to restore order. However, it primarily takes a step back and is used to move the plot forward through its three hour running time.\n\nWhile there are noticeable flaws that do question its best picture win at the Oscars. Gladiator has enough spectacle, breathtaking scenes of brutal pathos, battle choreography and style that recalls the most influential films of the classic Sword & Sandal genre. It has performers that either act to the point of the camp and those that give the film a really epic and dramatic scope. I really enjoyed this film; while there is enough to take issue with it, the film is so grand on many feats. With Russell Crowe happily taking the challenge of centre stage and leading the proceedings under Ridley Scott's firm direction.",

            "content": "Ridley Scott is a connoisseur of metistically crafted universes, from the distorted mechanical surrealism of Alien to the bleak futuristic dystopia of Blade Runner. In one of his entries, Gladiator, Scott takes a rather conventional story about Maximus Decimus Meridius, (Russell Crowe) a general-turned-gladiator who vows revenge once Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) kills his family and enslaves him, and crafts the marble death-consumed Empire in Ancient Rome, one likely inspired from Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus. That said, while the English director flourishes his gritty and eye-candy panache, he is unfortunately enslaved by weak screenwriting and Hollywood intervention. The story mostly resembles Braveheart with its \u2018fight for freedom' allusions, the main character's family's death, an affair with royalty, and the chariot full of historical inaccuracies. In Gladiator, the script gives little for Scott to develop Maximus's character interactions and instead gives time for dated special effects, excessive typical movie violence, plot-related dialogue, and scenic vistas. The supporting characters themselves can be flat and paint-by-numbers as they resemble the tropes of Hollywood: the slave driver who inspires the warrior, the maiden who once loved our hero, the over-the-top spoiled and power-greedy emperor, and the Senate who oversee the events, but do little. Also, did we need to have the scene with Maximus and Lucius? I know the executives of Dreamworks (mainly Steven Spielberg) wanted Maximus to be a role model for children, but it goes almost absolutely nowhere and serves only as a visual reminder of, \"Oh yeah, he was a father.\" Speaking of, how many times can the movie obnoxiously flashback to his dead family before cutting back to the present day? So, I know people really love Gladiator, but as a Ridley Scott film, it is far from his best. \n\n(2 1/2 Ugly CGI Oliver Reeds out of 5)",

His character was so malevolent I wanted him to die from the beginning, but unfortunately the film left his death until the last 5 minutes and every time Maximus made progress, he got pushed back again to the point that the film was far too slow and felt ridiculously unrealistic. The cinematography was fine, the visual effects were ok for the time but dodgy in places, and Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was pleasant but sometimes felt disruptive over some of the dialogue. The action was quite entertaining, but the pacing was a serious issue that worsened the film. Nevertheless, Gladiator is worth a watch once.",

His tale of revenge as he becomes more powerful than the emperor is an exciting watch at times with the politics almost a side note. Phoenix plays the baddie with great aplomb, showing their is menace, naivety  and at times a child like persona. He looks like he enjoyed the part. Reed in his last role is terrific as the slave owner who in the end has a change of heart. He is commanding. The many stage fighting scenes are well directed and very bloody. Are you not entertained? I definitely was entertained. We see Maximus longing to be with his Wife and son with much linked to the afterlife. He had a good bond with many people who remember him as a commander and the Romans side with him. This causes Phoenix's Commodus to do whatever he can to be popular but also to start Maximus. I felt Phoenix and Reed were more deserving of the Oscar than Crowe, he is figure head of the film but does not offer the range of the other two.

I also found that the villain of the film Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix was perfectly cast, and very enjoyable to watch on the big screen.\n\nThe cinematography in my opinion was very strong with some really great shots of the characters.\n\nThe settings were also very strong ranging from the great city of Rome to the coliseum.\n\nThe set designs and props were done really well and fit the era perfectly, from the coliseum to the palace.\n\nThe costume designs and makeup like the set designs were also done really well, from the Roman soldier costumes to the many various injuries.\n\nThe film's colour scheme in my opinion is very strong and works with the cinematography and story really well.\n\nThe film also has some really good practical and special effects from the various stunts to the way the action sequences look both realistic and over the top.\n\nThe action may be over the top, but in my opinion it is still really strong from the direction of Ridley Scott to the entertainment value.\n\nThe music I also found my self enjoying and felt that it fit with the characters and scenes very well.\n\nThe story may not be the most unique out there, but it was still in my opinion steady and very entertaining to watch fold out.\n\nThe film at points also had a very strong atmosphere especially toward the beginning and end with The character Maximus.\n\nIf there's one thing I didn't very much like it was some of the fast paced editing, but it didn't distract from the experience of the film.\n\nThe film in my opinion is also really enjoyable and something that I hope to watch again very soon.\n\nOver all I give it a \n8/10\n89%\n4.45/5",

            "content": "The Best Picture of 2000 was You Can Count On Me, in my opinion, however the Academy had other ideas and decided to rewarded this Ridley Scott directed \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2~historical' epic. This is not a bad film by any means and it's definitely the best modern attempt at a lavish sword and sandal picture but when considering the many more interesting and memorable films to come out of the year 2000 it seems odd that something so middle of the road would triumph. Evaluating the film on it's own merits I found Joaquin Phoenix's performance entertaining, Ridley Scott's direction reliably great and the production design to be worthy of note.\n\nMaximus, Russell Crowe, is the adopted son figure of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Richard Aurelius, who chooses Maximus to lead over his own son, the ambitious Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix. Commodus murders Marcus Aurelius in retaliation for this decision and has Maximus' family killed while Maximus escapes his execution after he becomes leader. There is a hinted romantic attraction between Commodus' sister Lucilla, Connie Nielsen, and Maximus and she decides to side with Maximus covertly whilst Commodus' incestuous seduction continues. Maximus is captured and sold into becoming a gladiator and as his success continues his confrontation with Commodus nears.\n\nI have not yet seen Ben-Hur (1959) or The Last Emperor (1987), other notable epics that have won, but Gone with the Wind (1939) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) both have Gladiator beaten in terms of substance. The central issue with the film was that it's central character was intensely disinteresting where great epics like the aforementioned 1939 winner concern complex, sometimes downright dislikable characters who we root for as they struggle against various obstacles. Maximus has generic motivations for being a hero, \"The honor of Rome\", and lacks any interesting personality traits therefore it is difficult to feel any real connection with him because he is almost inhuman. He also succeeds immediately as a Gladiator and as I will discuss later the climactic battle has very little to tension or suspense to it because we have not yet seen Maximus lose a fight. Spending 2 and a half hours with a character that is not particularly compelling can be trying and if Maximus were to have some flaws or face any real obstacles I would have liked the film more.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum the villain, Commodus, is an interesting, flawed character who has sympathetic motivations but retaliates with excessive force against his father's cruelty. Phoenix's performance certainly makes the character compelling as his reaction shots during the gladiatorial fights are some of the highlights of the film. The heartbreaking monologue he gives after being rejected by his father, immediately followed by his unexpected murder, is a memorable moment that allows you to understand why this character is so determined to prove himself. The incest scenes between Commodus and Lucilla are also suitably creepy as Phoenix's gaze is predatory and sexually hungry while we also feel his need. If the entire film matched Commodus as a character and Phoenix's performance it would be a deserving winner but unfortunately it doesn't.\n\nScott's staging of the film is incredible as you would expect from the man who made Blade Runner (1982). The fight scenes in particular are well set up as we have spatial awareness during each fight which makes the blows dealt more impactful. The scale on which the fights occur is also set up well as we get quick exterior shots of the stadium and the contents of the stands in addition to focused reaction shots from the crowd. Each scene feels expensive and well choreographed, with the exception of a few green screen scenes, which means that the period detail can be captured and the film can serve as a visual feast of sorts despite brown being the primary color used.\n\nThis is a film that most people will see during their lives, my own father enjoyed it and excitedly re-watched it with me, whether they like this type of film or not because it's on it's way to becoming the 2000s equivalent of an \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2~iconic' film. I don't need to recommend this film because of that reason but in terms of how I personally felt about it I enjoyed more than the average action flick but I didn't find it to be a great film. My choice for Best Picture this year, out of the nominees, would be Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000).",

The beginning is pretty nice because it starts with a battle but the rising action of the film is a little boring, just people talking and the main character's journey to Rome.

Gladiator is all class in a highly entertaining depiction of a gladiator's tough life. \n\nAdmittedly, It is long, but the extended edition is worth the watch. The CGI has not aged well, Hans Zimmer's score is remarkably similar to his work for Pirates of the Caribbean. However, the entire film is a testimony to Scott's painstaking recreation of Rome, gladiator fights, war battles, and highly skilled drama.\n\nGorgeous landscapes and environments scale alongside beautiful sets. The scenery is accompanied by bloodshed of the most engaging and thrilling type. Scott's style oozes off the screen. We get a fantastic story, nuanced acting, and a glorious finale. Gladiator deserves all its praise.\n\nSpeaking of acting, Russell Crowe gives his career best in all possibility. Crowe's sorrow and righteous indignation is only comparable to his perfect performances in A Beautiful Mind or Master and Commander that follow Gladiator. Connie Nielsen lays down one of the most sympathetic roles ever captured on film. Joaquin Phoenix portrays one of the most heinous and reviled villains in cinema history.

One used to watch this kind of movies as simple entertainment but now Scott created art whilst providing entertainment. Russel Crowe was phenomenal as the titular gladiator but for me the one who really stands out is Joaquin Phoenix. His performance simply made Commodus real, he gave him depth, he morphed him into a despicable being. Hans Zimmer's score helps shape the entire story, lifts the movie into higher levels. Can this man simply do no wrong? \nPS: It felt so good watching Richard Harris on screen again, such a nice surprise. Also.does young Joaquin Phoenix look like a younger Michael Stuhlbarg? Can you see the resemblance or is it only me?",

The soundtrack was fantastic by Hans Zimmer, the special effects were decent, the fight choreography was executed quite well, the story was flawless, and the writing was intriguing overall. What else is so special about it? Maximus Decimus Meridius, the main protagonist and disgraced commander who was betrayed by Lucius Aurelius Commodus, later gets his revenge on Commodus after he gave the order to murder Maximus' wife and son. After Commodus murdered Marcus Meridius, the father of Maximus, for not picking him to become the next emperor earlier in the film, Commodus became the next emperor and chose to betray Maximus by default. Maximus is captured, and is forced to work against his will as a gladiator. At the end of the film, Emperor Commodus stabs Maximus in his back with a knife prior to his arrival at the center of the amphitheater for one last fight. Despite the pain he was in, he was still able to kill Commodus. Furthermore, Maximus died at the end of the film and I was actually shocked by this. There aren't too many movies where both the villain and hero are killed off at the end. The Tomatometer and audience score on this site prove that this film is one of the most underrated films of all time.",

Especially the armor and the setting locations of the different places. You can see how unfit Commodus is for being an emperor and also how compassionate Aurelius is towards Maximus, it's really sweet. Wow, Commodus is a son of a bitch, so vicious and malicious. \n\nI can't believe how beautiful some of these shots of the locations are. It looks like Cappadocia. It's crazy how almost flawless the story progresses and unfolds. This movie was brilliantly written. Crazy how back in the days, entertainment was humans fighting humans or lions. It hasn't changed much, only that we're not fighting with bladed weapons on national TV, now it's with our fists. \n\nWhat a badass though, cut right through all those enemies. The story kind of reminds me of Barry Lyndon's. Seeing all the gladiators work together in the Colosseum was awe inspiring. Fucking ambush is bullshit. I will say around the third quarter of the movie it does get a bit dull around the edges. But I understand it's for consistency. You really see Commodus' colors shine towards the end. You get a good understanding of who he really is: a conniving piece of shit.\n\nThe ending was perfect. Justice was served and the scales were balanced. Maximus got what he really wanted: to be with his family on the farm. But he not only died with honor, he died as a hero who wanted to see Rome back on it's feet. Very beautiful ending.\n\nOverall, fantastic movie with a really good story line and terrific acting. I watched it in theaters when it came out but I was too young to understand how good it was.

Russell Crowe's Oscar-winning performance is just the icing on this blood-soaked cake, but what a furiously memorable icing it is. Also, let's not go without mentioning Hans Zimmer's wonderfully apt score either, as one can always count on the man to elevate a truly cinematic moment into the heights of iconicism. And, \"iconic\" is just the way to describe the film in sum. A true masterwork of the cinematic art and one that no person should skip out on.",

The soundtrack is fantastic and obviously similar to that of the one in the renowned \"pirates of the carribean\" series. However, more than that, the camerawork is stunning. Whether it is a sweeping shot of the screaming citizens of Rome, or the hazy yet oddly focused picture of Maximus's flashbacks, the image is always absolutely breathtaking. Above that, the historical accuracies that do exist within the film elevate it above the typical cheesy ancient history movies. Whether it is the depiction of the brutal slave trade, close-up of the cruel nature of man to man combat, or the trap doors and hypogeum of the Roman Colosseum, it is impossible to deny their contributions to the quality of the film. Russell Crowe does a terrific job in an almost certainly career defining role, and joaquin phoenix is equally enthralling. The politics of the film are nicely balanced with the violence of the Colosseum, and viewers are never bored. Twists are abundant, and it follows no cheesy or cliche plot lines. Overall, it is a fantastic movie and well worth watching.",

            "content": "Spontaneity can be the greatest inspiration. For Ridley Scott, the painting of a victorious gladiator looking up and staring into the crowd, Pollice Verso, spoke to him about the \"Roman Empire in all its glory and wickedness\". It inspired Scott to create and direct his brilliant, Academy Award winning film Gladiator (2000). The movie is more historical fiction than based on real events. Scott originally hired historians to keep it historically accurate. However, he deviated so much from real life to craft an amazing story that the historians preferred not to be credited for the film. Of course, the final product justifies his decision. Regardless of historical accuracy, Gladiator reinvigorated interest in the Roman and other classical cultures. Accordingly, it led to some copycatting in Hollywood with the release of films such as Troy (2004), Alexander (2004), Scott's own Kingdom of Heaven (2005), 300 (2006), etc. It is often referred to as the \"Gladiator effect\". Nevertheless, none of those films match the magnificence of Gladiator. Scott ventured into the same genre again with Kingdom of Heaven but did not come close to duplicating the success of Gladiator. For this reason, Gladiator is an anomaly. In addition, Russell Crowe recently admitted that \"We had 21 pages when we started shooting ... Your average script is about 110.\" He noted that \"it's also the dumbest possible way to make a film. The dumbest possible way.\" With this knowledge, it is shocking that the movie is not terrible. It is a miracle that it won Best Picture in 2000. Overall, it was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won 5. The wins included Best Actor (Russell Crowe), Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Mixing. The Awards are reflective of everything that makes this film great. It has great cast that features a flawless hero that everyone loves contrasted by a vile villain that everyone loves to hate. The dialogue is phenomenal and includes many memorable lines that have transcended time and continue to be quoted. The visual effects that include epic battles and depicting the zenith of Rome in all its decadence are spectacular. In addition, the music is incredible. It captures and complements the emotions of all the key scenes. Hans Zimmer is one of the best composers in his time and the Gladiator soundtrack is one of his best works. Gladiator delivers amazingly in all these elements and is one badass movie.\n\nPlease see http://rookerville.com/2016/10/29/retrospective-review-gladiator/ for my full review.",

Both are outstanding in their respective roles, making for an entertaining climax when the two meet. \n\nThe story is fantastic, it really grabs hold of the audience and as a viewer you go on a journey with the main protagonist (Crowe) and as he goes through the motions you do too.

Russ Crowe does the job as the brooding general-turned-slave and Joaquin Phoenix is even better as the conniving Caesar who kills his wise father in order to get the throne. On occasion, there is some dialogue that comes off a little ruff in its attempt to sound artistic, but it wasn't too bad of a detraction.

            "content": "\u00e2??My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aureliius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.\u00e2??\n \nGeneral-turned-gladiator Russell Crowe\u00e2??s powerfully operatic speech pretty much encapsulates the tangible intensity and pertinence the film emanates and is what makes it perhaps the most accomplished historical epic of the century so far. An ode to the sword-and-sandal epics of the 1960s, Gladiator carried cinema into a new century but for its audience transported them back to the one that had just ended. Dealing with an array of aspects of Roman history including gladiators, generals and emperors, this entertaining investigation into the misdemeanours of unbefitting supremacy and its effect on one man and his patient desire to avenge the ruler who wronged him, makes for an all-consuming motion picture. Who better to helm a film of such profound proportions in history than the man from Newcastle, Ridley Scott. His filmography includes films like Alien and Blade Runner, so to direct Gladiator could be considered easy work, but by no means is Gladiator a simple film. It is a film of epic proportions transporting us through a barrage of emotional distress, physical endeavours, educational theatre and most importantly a sense of poignant uplift during moments of intense sorrow. Gladiator brought cinema into a new century with a classic of the ages!\n \nThe two protagonists of Gladiator deliver performances of such a magnitude that the film transcends its level of plausibility and becomes a colossal spectacle. Russell Crowe portrays the protagonist Maximus, the Roman general betrayed by the emperor\u00e2??s ambitious son who reduces him to a life of slavery after the cold-blooded murder of his family. Legions away from his enemy and wallowing in grief, he gets a chance to rise through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena and gain revenge. Crowe truly places his soul into such a powerfully defeated man that the outcome of his acting delivers a mesmerising performance where what goes on in the inside of his character is more fathomable than what his exterior tells us. It is an acting feat when you can become the character and tell us so much about every facet of his personality as if he had been actually living a life. Around this time, Crowe was an actor in-demand and his performance as the gladiator exemplifies why. Joaquin Phoenix\u00e2??s performance as the antagonist of the movie, Commodus, provides an equally, if not more, effective character. Phoenix\u00e2??s Commodus is pure evil as he goes to extreme lengths to become the paramount emperor Rome has ever had; even murdering his own father to seize his throne. His malevolent ways heighten as the film progresses: from murder, to attempted incest and essentially incessant treason. Phoenix makes you physically hate not only his character but also everything Phoenix embodies unfortunately. This is testament to Phoenix who, like Crowe, put all his abilities into creating the other half of Gladiator\u00e2??s success.\n \nVisually, Gladiator\u00e2??s recreation of the heart of the ancient city of Rome using extensive CGI to complete shots were as magnificent as they would have been when erected. The beautiful recreation of Rome\u00e2??s main attraction, the Coliseum, to a fully established theatre in all its glory is undoubtedly the closest sight you will ever have of the realest thing. The accuracy of the visuals is unquestionable, but the film isn\u00e2??t the best educational tool to use as some stories are changed or created to suit cinematic understanding. Nevertheless, the fact that this film generated what is called the \u00e2??Gladiator Effect\u00e2?? demonstrates its effectiveness at generating interest of authentic Roman history. Gladiator pumped into the audience an increased fascination of Roman history and to be honest it still does. The term \u00e2??gladiator\u00e2?? is synonymous with this film\u00e2??s barbaric sport-like entertainment and the fact that it is in a place that still stands, the Coliseum, makes it all the more affecting because it deals with a 2,000 year-old story that incorporates places and features that still are with us today.\n \nThe score of Gladiator is perhaps one of the best ever to be released not only for the fact that it seamlessly blends into the atmosphere of the film so beautifully but also because it has endured in the hearts of the audience. Whenever someone watches the film, their mini review of how they enjoyed the film often involves the ethereal soundtrack. The score\u00e2??s such high demand in the film-music world is particularly indebted to singer Enya\u00e2??s vocals most prominently in the song \u00e2??Now We Are Free.\u00e2?? The heavenly-like vocals provide a sense of meaning to the imposingly majestic instrumentals. The collection of songs were provided by composers Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard and boy did they have a vision with this soundtrack as its divine-sounding elements have endured the film as a whole.\n \nAt the 73rd Academy Awards, Gladiator was nominated twelve times, winning five, including Best Picture. It is regarded as the best of its year and the first film to win it this century. It also won Best Actor for Crowe, Visual Effects, Costume Design and Sound Mixing demonstrating its efficiency across the board. Gladiator not only provided magnificent entertainment on screen, but it also catalysed the world\u00e2??s interest in one of the greatest empires to have existed stressing its importance not just as a film. It only took the 21st century less than a year to provide the world with a true cinematic classic, as it was not just a form of entertainment\u00e2?\u00a6 it actually meant something.\n \nGladiator is perhaps one of the greatest historical epics of modern times, as it has everything a cinematic spectacle requires\u00e2?\u00a6 and more!\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        10/10",

The lost majesty of ancient Rome is evoked, with everyone in full-on cast-iron warrior mode and more violence than you can shake a trident at. Philosophical lines and spears fly freely in equal measure as Crowe and Phoenix anchor the elegant script and John Mathieson achingly beautiful cinematography hits you with colors so pretty that the blood almost becomes another accent.

Commodus is also an interesting and complex character that is integral to the story. The relationship between these two is very unique. I was a fan of how Commodus was always jealous of Maximus despite being in a superior position of power, and how it fueled the conflict. It's quite compelling. These two and all other characters are well acted and masterfully deliver an excellent screenplay that capture the setting and make it fun to just listen to people talk.\n\nThe fights leave a little to be desired. Except for the final duel, the choreography is rather shallow. It got so much better when it was just two people both fighting with a sword, rather than a sword and shield or another combination.

He's picked up by pillagers in a Roman province that lets us know how tired, and sad Maximus is. He comes back, going to the\u00c2\u00a0Colosseum \u00c2\u00a0and surviving attacks game planned, and also death planned. Battle for Maximus and Commodus at the end, which is very exciting and hard to watch for Maximus. Already injured, Maximus still stands tall. Until the end as he goes o see his family in the after life. Gladiator is a movie you\u00c2\u00a0DEFINITELY\u00c2\u00a0want to see again and again. It is very interesting, and also very haunting for our hero trapped under the enemy. Rated R.",

You think '300' took itself way too seriously; this is probably the most self-serious epic since 'Ben-Hur' and the one that really defined the epic genre since the turn of the millennia.  In all honesty, my feelings towards 'Gladiator' are much more based on nostalgia than anything else and Commodus really needed to decide whether or not we were supposed to sympathize with him or be scared by him - never mind how it totally ignores history - but I just can't help it.  What really sells the movie is the acting: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed, among others, give it their all and provide so much more than the script probably gave them in the first place.  At my age and experience with cinema, I don't usually gravitate towards this kind of blunt, brutish, testosterone driven cinema, but there is always an exception to every rule.  To answer a very obvious question: \"I am thoroughly entertained!\"",

            "content": "\"Are you not entertained?\" - as Maximus yelled to the crowd. I am pretty much entertained by this movie. I could not think of any Roman Empire films or historical epics in general, that could match the authenticity of this film. I've seen the classics such as Ben-Hur, Spartacus and more. This well made Ridley Scott epic is all that I can think of. It is beautifully well made. The first thing I noticed here is the cinematography. It is brilliant! Amazing! The wonderful setting of Rome and its people. The huge arena, which is the center of the battlefield, where the event is held, and those fine armors and weapons. Thinking this is a well budgeted film. The story is about general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the emperor Marcus Aurelius's ambitious son, Commodus, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his emperor. I love the story. The ambiance of this film is spectacular. For instance the arena, and the number of crowds. When the battle scene heats up, the crowd cheers up loudly. Then again, silence the crowd and starts to focus on the hack and slash sequences. It feels like you are  in that arena neither as a fan or one of those gladiators who fights for the battle. I suggest, you raise up the volume of your speaker and you will definitely enjoy it. It is a nail biting experience, with edge of your seat sword fights. And never was I bored, the whole time I'm watching it. It is engaging as you can get. This is one of those films that, I will watch over and over again. With very memorable lines and sequences. Brilliant performances from the actors, especially for Russel Crowe as Maximus and the great Joaquin Phoenix as the asshole and he is perfect for the role.  It can't get much better than that. Oh, don't forget the chilling Hans Zimmer score. It adds up perfectly. Style and substance at the same time. A must see and a must have epic. 5/5",

But I thought they went a little too modern when they released the angry tigers because I'm sure they didn't have chutes that they could open like they did.  But the story has a light of its own, to which all the great scenery and great moving picture. The plot is pretty good, that is as dynamic as it is present. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is pretty cool, but still, making us feel like we're in it was awesome. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is pretty good. We have guys like Russell Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.

They win, and Marcus's son, Commodus, shows up. Commodus talks of how much he missed his father. In a private room, Marcus tells Commodus that he is going to give his powers to the senate and not to his son. Commodus is upset by this, and he suffocates Marcus to death. Commodus becomes leader. Since he knew that Marcus favored Maximus, Commodus gave orders to guards to kill Maximus in the forest. The guards take Maximus in the forest, and before they kill him, Maximus asks for a \"noble death.\" Before the guard stabs him, Maximus hits the guard and kills all of them, taking a large gash on his shoulder from the blow of a blade. He takes a horse and rides out to find his family. When he arrives, he finds the village burned, and his family hanged (by the guards by Commodus's orders). Maximus passes out from his wound on his shoulder. He wakes up noticing that he was captured by slave traders. \nHe gets bought by Proximo, a slave buyer. Proximo puts him into Gladiator tournaments. Maximus kicks butt at it, and Proximo is impressed. After this success, it is followed by more gladiator tournaments and the same amount of wins.What's driving Maximus to do so well is that by winning so many games, he'll get the chance to fight Commodus. He does well enough that he gets this chance. Just before the fight, Commodus stabs Maximus, and he tells the guards to put armor on Maximus so no one notices the wound. They go out into the arena, and Maximus, wounds and all, kills Commodus. Shortly after that, Maximus dies from the wound Commodus delivered to him earlier.\n\n\nIn the beginning, I thought it rushed us in a little too quickly. I don't even know what cause of the battle they were fighting was. When the scene of the audience finding out that the guards had hanged Maximus's family, I thought that they should have put more sentimental value into his wife and son in order to make that part more emotional. The scene of Lucilla and Maximus kissing was a slight annoying. I found this annoying because he showed that he loved his (deceased) wife very much, yet he so willingly kissed Lucilla back. It went against everything he was supposedly about. Because of such flaws, I'm giving the movie a 3.5/5.",

Maximus was offered to rule over Rome after Marcus. Upon killing his father Commodus tried to kill Maximus and his family. He succeeded in killing Maximus's wife and child, but Maximus escaped. Maximus returned home to find his family crucified. From there he was taken by slave traders and sold to a man who trained gladiators to fight in arenas. Maximus did well in the arena and earned the nickname Spaniard because nobody knew who he was. He was eventually taken to Rome to fight in the Coliseum. He destroyed the competition and was confronted by Commodus who was going to congratulate him on his success. When Commodus asked who the Spaniard was Maximus revealed himself and shocked Commodus. The emperor let Maximus live because if he killed him Rome would turn against him. After confronting Commodus a plot to free Maximus arose. A senator bought Maximus's freedom so he could gather an army to take over Rome and return it to the senate. Commodus found out about the plot and stopped it. Commodus decided to fight Maximus one on one. Before the fight started Commodus stabbed Maximus in the back and concealed it. The already weakened Maximus still managed to kill Commodus. After killing Commodus, Maximus put the control of Rome in the hands of the senate.

At the end of the battle, you see the emperor of Rome Marcus Aurelius congratulating Maximus for his victory and thanking him for serving him for as long as he has. Later, in the army camp, Marcus calls Maximus to his tent to ask him to take over Rome and free it from all of the corruption and give Rome back to the people.However Maximus declines his offer and would like to return to his family and his farm.

His family has been Killed and his farm burned. He collapses and goes unconscious only to be captured and sold into slavery. It was intended for Maximus to be killed in combat as a Gladiator however he did so well that they took him to Rome for him to perform in the Coliseum.

There are some awesome fights with well-done choreography.  But at the same time this film has a great story, filled with betrayal, revenge, and beautiful character development.  However, I will admit that the ending is disappointingly predictable.  If you've seen an action movie, you probably know how this film will end.\n\nAnother great aspect of \"Gladiator\" is the great performances of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.  Russell Crowe's performance as Maximus feels natural and authentic.  He fills the role excellently.  Joaquin Phoenix really captures the greed and arrogance of a prince who inherits the throne.  He makes for a great antagonist.\n\nThough it may start out slow, once things pick up, \"Gladiator\" turns out to be an exciting film that will keep you hooked.  Ridley Scott has brilliantly created a film that pays great homage to Roman culture and the Roman values of honor and bravery.",

We can see he is betrayed by people he once trusted and he is sentenced to be killed. Surviving, he tries to once again reclaim his name and avenge the death of his family.\n\nThe picture is beautiful. It wasn't complicated to follow the lore or the story, so that's good. The acting was great. I loved Crowe doing what he does best. As always, there may be some inconsistencies but no movie is without them.

Maybe it's because I didn't watch Ben-Hur, I thought the plot of it is new to me, even though the first 20 minutes of it had been done before and I couldn't careless about. The main problem that I definitely agree with, is that the main character is thin in characterization. The movie doesn't give me enough details of the main character which doesn't make me feel anything for him.

            "content": "Are you not entertained every time you watch GLADIATOR (2000)?! Because I am. This is one of director Ridley Scott's masterpieces and has one of the most powerful and extraordinary performances from Russell Crowe ever. This Academy Award-winning epic is a revenge story about a loyal Roman general, Maximus Decimus Meridius (Crowe), who is framed for the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) by the latter's ambitious son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who desperately seeks the throne. Reduced to being a slave and forced gladiator, Maximus rises through the ranks of the arena and tries to oppose Commodus in an attempt to avenge the loss of his family and the old emperor. Once again we've come down to one of my favorite movies of ALL TIME and my favorite Ridley Scott movie-he masterfully directs this beautiful historical epic and draws out so many amazing performances. The gladiatorial battles are spectacular to watch and the \"Are you not entertained?!\" scene is one of the best scenes in the movie. Ridley Scott does an ASTOUNDING job of recreating Rome and the Colosseum, and in my opinion the film's CGI holds up.\n\nThis was also one of the movies that contributed to my love of film in a big way because Gladiator really pushed me forward into checking out more mature films; it was actually the first R-rated movie I had ever seen. The movie is literally perfect: the action is tense and exciting; the drama is intriguing and brilliantly acted; and as far as historical dramas go, this has to be one of the best. Actually, upon its immense success this movie made Hollywood go, \"Whoa, everyone loves Gladiator! Let's make more sword-and-sandal epics!\" .... Yeah, we got Troy, 300, and 300: Rise of an Empire out of that. I personally don't really care for that genre...\n\nBut back to the movie that's actually awesome. This film would not be nearly as good without Russell Crowe's fantastic performance as Maximus. In my opinion, Russell Crowe is one of the best actors of all time. Seeing as how Daniel Day-Lewis is the god of acting, if he didn't exist then that title would definitely go to Crowe. He has NEVER phoned in any performance, and in every single movie Crowe hits it out of the park-Maximus would be second favorite performance of his behind John Nash in A Beautiful Mind. As Maximus, Crowe gave a brutal performance and he perfectly embodied the character-I wholeheartedly believe he deserved that Best Actor Oscar. However, Joaquin Phoenix on the other hand did not win Best Supporting Actor and he totally got snubbed. He was the creepiest part of the movie, and when I say creepy, I mean CREEPY!!!! Show this to any young kid--around 10 or 11, the age when I first saw it--and they will most likely curl up in fear over how weird and unsettling the character is in some scenes. Obviously, I did not do such a thing. That might even happen to someone older; in the end, it is truly a haunting and unforgettable performance.\n\nConnie Nielsen portrays Commodus' sister, Lucilla, and she's unfortunately overshadowed by everyone else. That's not to say she's bad; I think she is great in the movie. But if we take the quality of each and every performance into account, Nielsen is outweighed by the other leads. Again, she's great in the movie, but whenever I think of Gladiator, Connie Nielsen is not one of the first few people to come to mind. However, that's not the same case for Djimon Hounsou. This man is hands down one of the most underrated actors working in Hollywood, but he is so fucking awesome. I LOVE Hounsou in any role he does,and he definitely had a lot to do in Gladiator. His chemistry with Crowe was spectacular, and I especially love the very last scene of the film. If you have seen the movie then you know that the last scene of the film... That my friends is a genuine act of friendship and respect. In essence, put him in more movies Hollywood! Other than him, this film also stars Oliver Reed as Proximo-he acts as Maximus' mentor, in a way, when the latter is forced to become a Gladiator. Finally, Richard Harris plays Marcus Aurelius in the beginning of the film. I'm sure you are all familiar with Harris since, you know, he was the original Dumbledore and all.\n\nSo as I said, Ridley Scott perfectly recreates the Roman time period. And I stress the word perfectly, becomes he completely immerses you in the world. In my opinion, the special effects still hold up to this day and whenever the film is on TV (well I have the Blu-ray too) I automatically switch to it and I just watch it again and again, every single time instantly being sucked into the world that Scott had made. The battle sequences though: they are extremely violent and REMARKABLE! The opening sequence itself is both fierce and stunning to watch. Maximus asks in the film, \"Are you not entertained?! Are you not entertained?!!\" And my reply to him is: \"Fuck yeah, I'm entertained!\" Which leads me into the script-so many quotable lines from Gladiator and every scene is so well written. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the \"My name is Maximus....\" Scene-if you've seen the movie then you know how magnificent it is. I know some people would say the plot is simple, but in all honesty, there's nothing wrong with that. For this movie at least. The film is still elevated to enormous heights due to all of its other aspects.\n\nBut what would this movie be without Hans Zimmer's score! Holy shit, this guy is on his way to become the next John Williams (I wouldn't say he's there just yet). Can you believe he's only won one Oscar for Best Original Score-Lion King-but did not win for Gladiator or Inception among others? It puzzles me because every freaking melody that Zimmer composes for this movie is mind-blowingly good. Actually, I completely forgot to mention that he wasn't the only one working on the Gladiator score; Lisa Gerrard was also composing with him. But still, they both did a spectacular job!\n\nAll in all, Gladiator is Ridley Scott's best movie ever! You got the best performances; great direction; the score was so elegant; every action sequence was engaging; and Rome was recreated in the grandest way possible. This movie is a MUST-SEE film and it will definitely open other doors for you if you don't know Ridley Scott's filmography or Russell Crowe's filmography, etc. that well. Forget Troy and those other sword-and-sandal movies, and EXPERIENCE Gladiator for what it is. All those other movies would never have happened if Gladiator was not so great in the first place. They might possibly cross your mind now and then, but Gladiator is different. It has stood the test of time and will be remembered and enjoyed forever - 100/10",

I was impressed with Crowe's and Phoenix's performances, but I'm not really attributing this to Scott, because look at the acting in Prometheus and The Counselor, and because Crowe and Phoenix usually are great in any movie. Also I thought the opening battle sequence was poorly done, it was shaky and didn't really express the epic scope that it should have. I have to admit, the \"are you not entertained\" scene was great, as was the script. I was going into the movie expecting the script to be poor, but it was Ridley Scott, as usual. I do think Alien is great, and so is Blade Runner, but how many bad movies has he made? This one though, definitely entertained me. 7/10",

But at that point your movie kind of forgot about the gladiatorial combat that sold tickets in the first place and kind of became more of a political thriller.  Albeit an ancient history political thriller but one nonetheless.  \nRoman general Maximus refuses to pay allegiance to duplicitous new emperor Commodus and is forced into slavery as a gladiatorial combatant. \nThe performances in this film are very solid from top to bottom.  Russell Crowe shows the intensity that catapulted him into mega stardom after this picture.  Juaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris are also really good.  Ridley Scott is a director's actor.  One thing he is not, however, is a great director of action.  He's not as bad as his late brother, but for the most part the fight scenes lack cohesion.  Especially the early ones are chopped into quick cuts that are hard to follow.  Despite that criticism, the tour de force battle involving chariots in the colosseum is still rousing, partially due to Maximus' direction of his \"soldiers\" during this scene and and a sense of momentum.  \nAnything involving the senators is definitely not as compelling, the film loses sight of who it's audience is during these scenes.  We are left cold during these dialogue sessions and just wondering when the next battle is going to take place.  Still, the film remains exciting and dramatic 14 years after it's release.  Score: 8",

I would go as far as say that Gladiator may even deserve the Oscars it went onto the win that year. You also can't help but give the production team credit for finishing Oliver Reed's performance after he had passed. It is definitely worth watching the documentary on the process. \nWhilst I don't dislike the film, I didn't really seem to enjoy it the second time around as much as I had hoped. Although, I first watched it about 10 years ago, I still remembered the odd moment. Unfortunately, time had exaggerated what I had remembered and it had failed to live up to my memories. Even mere hours after viewing it again, I still can't put my finger on what exactly let me down about the film. The running length could have been shortened down slightly and I am still unsure about Russell Crowe as the lead, but there is something else. It's a good chance that knowing how the film was going to play out could have been what caused my lack of enjoyment. Still, I shall give the cast and crew credit for creating such a well made epic.",

Don't ask me why I haven't watched his films in the past, but I've never watched any film from this acclaimed filmmaker. So when it came time for me to decide which of his films, I decided to begin his career with his sole Best Picture winner, Gladiator. And while I had doubts on whether I would enjoy this or not,  it turns out that Gladiator is one of the most awesome movie spectacles I've ever encountered!\n\nSet in the year of 180 AD, The Roman Empire goes into chaos after the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Rome's most trusted general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), and a key player to the emperor, is betrayed by Marcus' corrupt son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), and ends up being sold into slavery. Feeling empty after his betrayal and the tragic murder of his family, Maximus is trained by his master (Oliver Reed) into becoming a gladiator to avenge his family and regain his freedom. But Commodus doesn't give up easily.\n\nThe film also stars Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus, Djimon Hounsou as gladiator ally Juba, and Connie Nielsen as Commodus' disapproving sister Lucilla.\n\nOne of my fears when watching Gladiator is that is action is going to overpower the story so much that the story will lose its epic power. But Ridley Scott doesn't do that thankfully. Gladiator is one of the most epic modern masterpieces ever made. The story, while a tad familiar, drastically pulls you in where you root for the main character. The action, particularly the scenes in the arena, are wondrously made, with Scott never downgrading the violence of gladiator matches. I can honestly say that Gladiator is one of the most violent movies I've ever seen, with insane decapitations and a ton of blood, and I was wowed by every minute of it. It's Oscar win for sound and visual effects are well-deserved. What makes Gladiator stand out is that it's more than just a violent look at the notorious Roman events. It's an epic political thriller, an epic revenge tale, and an epic dramatic tale as well (with plot elements including incest, murder, betrayal, revenge, and freedom). As for the epic stamp of approval, Gladiator definitely earns it. Even with CGI backgrounds, the film still manages to pull me in to its sheer spectacle. Ridley Scott was influenced by epics of the past to create his epic, such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus, and he does a flawless job.\n\nWell, the direction and visual spectacle is great, so what about the acting? It's great as well! Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his role as Maximus, and it's currently the best acting I've seen from him. Crowe brilliantly conveys human emotion in this truly complex character, and while I've doubted his acting in the past (Man of Steel, for example), Crowe showcases his raw talent in the finest way with this film. The other truly noteworthy performance is the one who almost won an Oscar for his work, and that's Joaquin Phoenix as the evil Commodus. While not as powerful acting wise as Crowe, his menacing presence is still well-done, and as the political turmoil intensifies, both Phoenix and Crowe delight in sheer brilliance.\n\nWhile a weak factor of the film compared to both Phoenix and Crowe combined, Connie Nielsen is still very good as Lucilla. Oliver Reed, in his final role, as he died of a heart attack during production, shows his awesome side as the slave owner (and gladiator trainer) Proximo. And in a role that I didn't expect, Dumbledore does an awesome job in his small role as Emperor Marcus.\n\nThe film also delights with its epic music score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. When a collaboration happens in composition, it can either be really strong or really atrocious. For Gladiator, the collaboration works. While this isn't Zimmer's greatest accomplishment, the powerful combination of Zimmer's strong instrumental touch with Lisa Gerrard's phenomenal wailing sound of stirring emotions really sum up the power factor of what makes Gladiator a strong film experience.\n\nGladiator is a very strong modern filmmaking experience. The revival of epic spectacle is very deserving for one of my favorite film genres, Scott's direction is powerful, the acting is great, the action is awesome, and the multiple complex layers work brilliantly. I think Ridley Scott has gained another fan. I'm still in craziness after watching the film. Final word of thought, if you haven't seen Gladiator already, do so. You won't regret it. It's one of the best Best Picture winners ever made.\n\n\"AM I NOT MERCIFUL?\"",

            "content": "In 2000, legendary director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) took a stab (pun intended) at updating the tired genre of the historical epic for modern audiences. His skill as a director certainly aided him, as Gladiator is undoubtedly an impressive feat. Nevertheless, it could not shield him from the wrath of critics and audiences worldwide when his passion project topped Peter Jackson's own (superior) passion project, The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring.\r\n\r\nIt's close to a decade-and-a-half since Gladiator took the world by storm, and Scott has gone on to many more projects since, but how does the film (one of the biggest of his career) hold up?\r\n\r\n\r\nNot awfully, it must be said. All the primary players have or had better films to their credit (Crowe's LA Confidential, Scott's Blade Runner and Alien, Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance in Walk The Line, and more), but Gladiator is perfectly-watchable, and admirably ambitious entertainment. Fine cinematography, dedicated acting, and and an expert eye behind the scenes combine to provide perfectly-serviceable summer entertainment.\r\n\r\nIn the year 180 AD, General Maximus Decimus Meridus (Russell Crowe) concludes a lengthy campaign of domination, conquering the Germanic tribes in a large-scale battle (one of the film's more impressive set pieces). Maximus is the favoured subject of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Irish legend Richard Harris), whose old age and poor health are catching up with him. His decision to appoint Maximus as the new emperor does not sit well with his disturbed progeny, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix, in the role that introduced his talents to the world).\r\n\r\nCommodus offs his father, before having Maximus' family killed. Before long, Maximus finds himself taken on by slave traders, who sell him to trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed, in his final role). Maximus trains as a gladiator, finds his way to the Roman gladiatorial battles, and begins his journey to find and exact revenge upon Commodus.\r\n\r\nThe film is certainly grandiose, for better or worse. The plot basically amounts to a soap opera (with helpings of betrayal, family drama, murder, assorted violence, and incest). Storytelling has certainly evolved since the genre's heyday, but the silliness hasn't changed very much. The writing is filled with depthless, quotable lines, and the actors portray it well, but it's not a stretch to say the film is skin-deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the saving graces of the film is the acting. Russell Crowe is so-often accused of being a boring actor, or one who never looks engaged with his material, but I disagree. His style is quite intense, but he brings a great sense of realism to the (absurdly clich\u00e9) character of Maximus. During quiet scenes of dialogue, Crowe's talent is on display: He infuses Maximus with a resolve, following the murder of his family, and an unabashed dignity. It can be hard for an actor to work with such sophomoric dialogue, but Crowe pulls it off with aplomb.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is similarly strong. Joaquin Phoenix has established himself as one of the most-eclectic, talented actors working today, and it was Gladiator that first got him noticed. His portrayal of Commodus, as the unhinged, enternally-bitter Roman Emperor deservedly won him plaudits for Supporting Actor. Connie Nielsen is the weakest of the trio, but she holds her own against the two stars of the show.\r\n\r\nThe peripheral players, such as Reed, Harris, Djimon Housou, and Derek Jacobi (whom fans of Doctor Who will recognise as Doctor Yana from the series 3 finale) are all well-chosen, and round out a very promising cast.\r\n\r\nScott's eye as director is similarly put to good use. A weak colour palette is mostly made-up for thanks to strong choreography, and suitably-grand production design. The armours, furs, and dress all rest easy upon the eyes, and feel quite authentic. Battles are exciting, acting is engaging and the period details are impressive.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is quite marvelous. Hans Zimmer's music is front-and-centre for much of the picture, highlighting just about the entire running-time. The main theme is just-about inescapable, and while it is a fitting throwback to the epics of the past, it can prove wearisome for many modern audiences. That's not to take Zimmer's enormous talent lightly (the composer of The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and 2013's Rush deserves his fair share of credit), but the music's use in Gladiator begins to outstay it's welcome.\r\n\r\nOf course, not everything is perfect. Far from it in fact, as Gladiator falls into the trap of confusing depressing tones with a heightened sense of importance. Note to Ridley Scott: While you are undoubtedly one of the most innovative director's to have ever laid their talents to production design (Blade Runner and Alien again), you would have done well to add a bit of diversity to Gladiator's palette. You can shoot as many arenas and battlefields as you want, but if the visual tone is as grim as it is, there is simply no hold for an audience.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with our theme of grimness, the writing is quite dull. Yes, yes, I love \"Are you not entertained!\" as much as everyone else, but the screenplay is decidedly hammy, and lacks bite. The story is predictable, and the converstaions between characters feel mighty-forced. It's serviceable for a summer blockbuster (ostensibly what the film is), but not for a Best Picture winner.\r\n\r\nOver all, Gladiator is a solid crowd-pleaser that enjoys a reputation somewhat unfitting. The cast is well-chosen, and Scott is marvelous behind the camera, but the dialogue is clunky, the plot boring and predictable, and the visuals far too bleak. While a Best Picture winner it should not be, one can see why Gladiator is the beloved film it is. To answer the question Maximus poses: Yes, I was entertained.\r\n\r\nFinal Grade: C",

When this film came out, and won Best Picture, it greenlit a lot of films similar to it as years pass. Films like Troy, A Knight's Tale and King Arthur were made in trying to match the success of Gladiator. I think the film will prove to be more influential in the years to come.\n\nGladiator was written by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson. The film explores the story of a man who seeks vengeance for the murder of his family. The driving story of the film is very simplistic and one can simply watch it and focus entirely on it, but they would be missing out on what makes Gladiator such a strong film. The film touches on themes of love, home, religion, revenge, and politics. These themes doesn't put it all on our protagonist, instead breaking it up with each one focusing on a certain character and connecting one another through it's simple narrative. Home and religion is a strong theme of the film as these are the aspects that are connected with our protagonist. Maximus is patriotic but he is only serving his duty to get back home. Religion is a layer that is found in our protagonist and the film doesn't try to use it as a way to endorse it but rather as a metaphor for something bigger. I found the antagonist of the film to be very interesting as we are given a character who is emotionally and psychologically flawed. There is so much pain and hollowness to this character and throughout the entire film, he is figuring out ways to fill it. That void is love. I found the structure of how the protagonist and antagonist are written to be engaging, showing off a human story that is easily relatable. The large idea that the film tackles is related to it's exploration on Rome's politics and the people in it. How the film depicts Rome's citizens may not be a big deal and clear back then but watching it now, I see the connection it has with the real world. I loved the idea of the Colosseum audience being very similar to the first world audience of today, both having similar reactions to the symbolic figures of our society and how we react to the controversy that occurs with these figures. Gladiator also address the politics of Rome, which I thought was quite interesting as it explored on the structure of the country's leadership and the corruption that occurs within it. The film employs this idea of the people would be better off by the hands of a senate rather than under the dictatorship of a Caesar, as the members in it would be the representation in taking care of the people's needs. The film's dialogue was good for the most part, with lines that hit hard when heard and addresses strongly on the film's themes. My issue with it was that it sounded too Hollywood, being too on point, never giving any room for any naturalistic dialogue. Everything being said sounds too important and always in relation to something bigger.\n\nThe film was directed by Ridley Scott. The films between this and Blade Runner are ones that I have not had yet the opportunity to watch, so I cannot comment on how he has progressed in his filmmaking. Other than that, Gladiator is astounding and showing that the director still has the ability to make a wonderful film. Scott's choice in making this film was a big risk, as these type of films haven't been popular in the years leading to it, and epic films have changed since it's glory days. Well after seeing this film, it is clear that the risk has payed off. I think it was clear from Scott, since the beginning of the film's production, that he wasn't going to make an epic film similar to the great ones from the 50s-60s as the film isn't so much concerned with Rome itself but instead the personal drama of these certain individuals. This approach was definitely interesting and unique as the classic sword and sandal films seems to always have a big message attached to it and is much more focused in it's production design, ambition and scope rather than it's fiction. Though the film is more concerned with it's story, the film also consists of great sequences that proves that this is an A-list production. Scott gave the film some edge with a battle sequence at the start, though not entirely relevant to the film's plot, it is really fun to watch and is quite impressive. I felt that the scene, in it's own way, was trying to match the beach sequence in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. There is also other moments in the film that shows similarities to other films, like the execution sequence felt similar to Kubrick's Paths of Glory. The film's tone is uplifting and the film's final moments tries to provoke an emotional response from you, and for me personally I thought it worked. The film pacing was also great, as I never felt the talkative scenes were slow and draggy; and I was watching the 170 minute Extended Cut. Gladiator was able to keep my interest all the way through. The film also contained CGI, but the film rarely made me take notice of it as it is only applied to improve the look and add little details to Rome. It allows the audience to be immersed in the world and be wowed at it's distinction.\n\nThe film's director of photography was John Mathieson. This is the first of a couple of films that he would be collaborating with the director. His future work with Scott includes, Hannibal, Matchstick Men, Kingdom of Heaven, and Robin Hood. What Mathieson has done for Gladiator was great. He creates this not so-slick look, which works with the film's brutality in it's violence. The film's image has this polarizing look, with nights taking this steely cold blue look and the daytime sequences, particularly during the Colosseum sequences, has this golden look to it. Not entirely sure what Scott or Mathieson was trying to say with this style, but it doesn't matter because overall it works.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. I am not sure how much of the film's soundtrack she was involved in but from the tracks that I do know she participated in, it was really effective. Her beautiful voice at the end created this spiritual aura to it which made the scene much more impactful than what it already was. I was heartbroken at the end of the film, but at the same time I was joyful, and a lot of it was due to Gerrard's beautiful voice. Zimmer's score was also amazing, also creating this spiritual effect but also taking in influences of the music commonly attached to that period of time. Zimmer knows how to create an emotional impact in his films, and Gladiator is a prime example of that.\n\nRussell Crowe is the film's protagonist and he does a great job in the role. Maximus never seems to be a role that only a specific actor can play, as there isn't a distinctive physical quality that limits the role. Maximus is a character that is fueled by anger due to the loss of his family and home. Crowe achieved in giving the character this rage inside him, without being overly too obvious. The sorrowful moments with this character worked overall due to Crowe's acting. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus was the most interesting character in this film, because his role is layered with so much emotional pain. The way this character was written felt very contemporary and I think that is the main reason why I was so interested with him. Phoenix came off as immature and physically weak, which was important in order to create this damaged and fragile person and it is what also made the performance stand out. The rest of the cast was also great but nothing as noteworthy as the main two actors.\n\nGladiator is an almost perfect movie consisting of great performances, well written script and smart direction. It shows Scott back in true from, creating a blockbuster while offering more than just thrills and the occasional visual spectacle.",

            "content": "When Gladiator came out, it was like a breath of fresh air. It has been so many years since the sword and sandal genre was used in cinema. When this film came out, and won Best Picture, it greenlit a lot of films similar to it as years pass. Films like Troy, A Knight's Tale and King Arthur were made in trying to match the success of Gladiator. I think the film will prove to be more influential in the years to come.\n\nGladiator was written by John Logan, David Franzoni, and William Nicholson. The film explores the story of a man who seeks vengeance for the murder of his family. The driving story of the film is very simplistic and one can simply watch it and focus entirely on it, but they would be missing out on what makes Gladiator such a strong film. The film touches on themes of love, home, religion, revenge, and politics. These themes doesn't put it all on our protagonist, instead breaking it up with each one focusing on a certain character and connecting one another through it's simple narrative. Home and religion is a strong theme of the film as these are the aspects that are connected with our protagonist. Maximus is patriotic but he is only serving his duty to get back home.

Like they actually went back in time and made a movie in that time soon. \nOther than crow it stars Joqauin Phonix who eventually becomes Ceaser who doesn't know how to rule and pretty much a baby. His father never wanted him to rule and asked Crows character to rule instead, but Ceaser dies and Phoniex takes over.\nDoes this film have flows?

Instead, I will write one-to-two-paragraph long blurbs and post them as my reviews. If you want them expanded upon, please comment, and I will then write a full review for them. As always, recent movies that are still in theaters or came out this year will get full reviews.\r\n\r\nA Best Picture win, hundreds of accolades and awards, and widespread critical acclaim are all behind Gladiator's fame and popularity. Directed by one of the best directors of all time, and starring Russell Crowe, the movie is a throwback to classic Hollywood epics such as Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur. So it's really too bad that it's such a piece of shit. Ridley Scott, the director, made two great movies, a few mediocre ones, and has now plunged into full-on anus of cinema with this and Prometheus. The guy is a great director, but can't choose scripts to save his life. And Gladiator is no exception.\r\n\r\nThe movie tells the story of Maximus (what a creative fucking name), a general in the Roman army who is so powerful, influential, and good, that the dying king names him as the future emperor, not his son (Joaquin Phoenix). Phoenix is, as always, awful in this movie, playing a Mitt Romney-like snivelling little brat who complains about Crowe's superiority, kills his own father, rules Rome with an iron fist, brings back Gladiatorial contests, and lets poor people starve to death. He's an unlikable actor, which makes his character even less likable-- almost to a point where you wonder why they even bothered. The character is so one-dimensional and boring, there's nothing entertaining about it. The morals of this movie are so black-and-white that the audience isn't given any opportunity to actually think about what's happening onscreen.\r\n\r\nSomehow, the visuals are so good they're bad: Rome looks like a leftover set from The Phantom Menace. Every scene feels so concocted, cliched, and manufactured that the movie might as well have been called \"Generic Swords and Sandals Movie.\" The script is uninspired as well, featuring whole scenes that are unnecessary and are clearly padding the overstuffed running time. Altogether, there's not much to enjoy here other than cheesy Hollywood fun. Final Score for Gladiator: 3/10 stars. No, Russell Crowe. I was not entertained.",

            "content": "It took a long time but I finally saw Gladiator. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix star in a story I have seen plenty of times in movies. The story is simple. Guy in high power gets betrayed by a jealous brother and falls to the bottom and has to climb back up to gain his vengeance. How many times have I seen this? A lot. How many times does it work really well? A lot. In Gladiator it works really well. Everything from the acting to action worked in this movie.\n\tLike I said the plot is basic but it works. I have seen this movie before just with a different setting and characters. Russell Crowe is a general for the Roman Empire, Maximus, and his father who adopted him is dying wants him to take over the empire. Commodus, Phoenix, is the rightful heir to the throne because he is blood related but he takes his brother out of the picture anyway by betraying him and murdering his family. Maximus survives and becomes a Gladiator to get his revenge. I figured out the ending to this movie and most of the key plot points but it was still amazing.\n\tRussell Crowe gives an amazing performance in this movie, winning him an Oscar. Crowe has an amazing talent for acting and this was his best performance. Luckily he didn't sing. His best scene is when he finds his family dead. He has an emotional breakdown. Another when Commodus is tempting Maximus to fight and he keeps his composure. Any normal man would have broken down but he kept his cool. Maximus is a very interesting character and a natural leader. \n\tI don't know why Joaquin Phoenix's career went down the tubes but he comes through in the clutch in this movie. Commodus is one of the creepiest villains in any movie. He stalks his nephew and wants to sleep with his sister. His jealousy and anger towards Maximus drives his performance. When he is on screen its intense. His emotion escalates rather quickly. Phoenix got nominated for an Oscar and I think he deserved it. \n\tThe fighting scenes in this movie were top of the line. My favorite being the one with the tigers. I saw the tiger come out and I went nuts. I was pumped and as unrealistic as it was, it was awesome. The Colosseum looked real and amazing. The lack of CGI shows and it makes the movie better. Watching this I pictured the making of the movie and the set. The sands of the Colosseum were probably real and the first section of seating was probably used with extras. The second two had to be CGI for budget common sense but the movie felt real. \n\tI watched the director's cut of this movie so it was really long. Honestly I got a little bored and most of the added in scenes I could spot out. There was a lot of filler that didn't need to be in there. I took that into account when thinking back on the movie. The regular version is probably a lot better and cleaned up but the backstory was still interesting. \n\tCharacter relationships are obviously very important and none was creepier than the one with Commodus and his sister. Many times in the movie he tries to kiss his sister. There comes a point where he demands she give birth to his future son. That's messed up. It shows how sick his character is. I understand power hungry but this guy was 110% crazy. Maximus is a great leader and has great relationships with his soldiers. There is the one huge guy and the other black guy he befriends and they are both incredible. Secondary characters like that are important and they do their part.\n\tOverall, Gladiator is a masterpiece and I don't know why I waited so long to see it. Hans Zimmer adds an excellent score and captures the emotional part of the movie. Ridley Scott directs this film in the right into the academy awards and he really let his stars shine. Crowe and Phoenix give it their all and help push this movie to get the WillyT Seal of Approval.",

Set against the handsomely done backdrop of Ancient Rome, the time-old themes of friendship, power, loyalty and vengeance are captured beautifully here with stunning performances from Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen  keeping their audience anchored in the unfolding plot. That said, there's no denying that this film belongs to an electrifying Joaquin Phoenix, whose portrayal of an erratic and complex ruler ensures that all eyes are on him; his brilliant albeit brief 'busy little bee' dialogue marks one of the greatest scenes in the actor's diverse career.",

Director Ridley Scott crafts a film that's dramatic, thrilling, action filled, and just simply beautiful, ranking as one of his best films (alongside Alien and Blade Runner). But the true highlight of the film is Russell Crowe's brilliant portrayal of the former Roman general Maximus. While his character's motivation is simply revenge, it's nevertheless compelling and well-acted and no one else could've done a better job as far as I'm concerned. Joaquin Phoenix's supporting role as Commudus is truly menacing and creepy, and when he meets his end by Maximus, I couldn't help but be satisfied. That's not a bad thing, quite the opposite actually; it just goes to show you how well Phoenix portrayed the evil tyrant. And last but certainly not least, Hans Zimmer's orchestral score is absolutely beautiful, touching on all sorts of emotions and elevating this film from great to utterly fantastic. In the end, Gladiator is a fantastic epic and is undoubtedly one of the best of its genre, ranking as one of director Ridley Scott's finest films.",

The direction of Ridley Scott is a big help, along with the stunning cinematography over each scene. The opening scene is a great example of cinematography and direction of Scott can make a real spectacle, as the story itself.\nThe film tells the story of a Roman General, the Spainiang Maximus (Russell Crowe). Maximus is a campaign in Germany led by the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) that has lasted over ten years, ten years that Maximus does not see his family. Aurelius sees courage and humility in Maximus, and the spirit of a true leader, proof is given that the entire Roman army loves and admires Maximus. Aurelius and Maximus had a great friendship and a love of father and son, this led to Maximus Aurelius appoint him to be the new leader of Rome after his death. Instructing Maximus to make Rome a republic once again, Maximus hesitate just because your pantry military hopes to return to his family in Spain, but the respect he has for the Emperor Maximus is very large. Everything changes when the arrogant and envious son of Aurelius, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) murders his father and orders the execution of Maximus and his family.\nMaximus manages to escape and return home, where he finds his wife and children crucified by the door. Maximus is arrested later and sold to a trainer of Gladiators, where he later becomes the best among them, and sees a path to his revenge.\nThe screenplay by David Franzoni and John Logan, is very well written, and highlights important historical facts in regards to the Roman Empire, a prime example of this is the whole political game that we see throughout the film, and also the functioning of the Roman army and also the gladiatorial games. And the direction that Ridley Scott is on top of that is amazing to behold, making everything around epic.\nAnother thing that makes the movie totally epic is the soundtrack of Hans Zimer, proving to be a true master.\nThe cast is fantastic in every detail, Joaquin Phoenix superb as always, but Russell Crowe is just PERFECT, it was this performance that led him to be one of the best actors of all time.\nThe whole movie is really great, is one of the best historical epics ever made, the direction and the performances are Perfect in every detail, and the film (which despite being violent), from those who will assist love like I did.",

Russell Crowe is quite good here, but the visuals are fairly drab and muddy. The combat sequences are extremely violent, but they lack relevant or tasteful context. It appears as though director Ridley Scott is completely intent on eliciting the same awed response from modern audiences as from the ancient Romans: spectacularly bloody death sequences are not just creatively staged (Nobody dies the same way twice), but are also highlighted by a rousing, epic score. It's morally manipulative, with every battle placing Maximus at a distinct disadvantage and against always-masked figures (dehumanizing them, they basically become monsters). It's a cheap way to get the audience to root for the hero, by brushing aside all that ugly business about people getting murdered for sport. \"Gladiator\" never seems to really hold itself accountable for the positively bloodthirsty manner by which it is presented.",

Ridley Scott does a great work building a solid epic with great action and well developed charcters (Russel Crowe and Djimon Hounsou being the obvious stand outs).

I found the story to this movie to be very interesting and it had me hooked from the beginning to the end. The characters in this movie are done very well in this movie, especially the main character Maximus. The character of Maximus is very well written but another reason why his character was done so well was because of Russell Crowe's terrific  performance. His performance in this movie won him an Oscar and it was well deserved because he was phenomenal in this movie. Crowe made his character so interesting and he also made me care so much for him. The supporting cast in this movie is great which includes Joaquin Phoenix as a very good villain. Ridley Scott is a magnificent director and he sure shows it with this film. A few more things to add is that this movie is just stunning to look at and Hans Zimmer/Lisa Gerrard's score is just brilliant. Overall Gladiator is a terrific movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great character driven movie.",

This is definitely his best performance so far.\nJoaquin Phoenix makes an enormous impression as well, and his villainous character is do powerfully portrayed that it is actually disturbing.

Dialogs that are well thought, and will only be simple if it fits the scene or the character. Smooth editing and excellent score to be bettered only by the best. And, finally, action with grimy characters that gives this movie the heartbeat of a titan.\n\nThe opening scene is particularly exceptional. The intrigue gets going pretty quickly putting our unwilling hero in a real and fatal mess. Each piece of the drama is put in place carefully, until everything comes together and the clash happens. It's one of Ridley Scott's great movies.\n\nRussel Crowe is the perfect hero, Joaquin Phoenix is truly mad, and both are irresistibly aimed at each other. Connie Nielsen play a very frightened sister that's at the same time courageous, yet worried about her son.\n\nThis time, I tried listening to it with a very critical eye and I found only the last moment of clarity of Maximus, when he gives his last order, to be a weak and somewhat artificial moment. Beyond that, unlike him, I would have bent my neck right away, and plotted after, but that's a personal decision. It would have killed the whole paradigm right away and made me less of righteous a hero than him.\n\nAnyway you dice it or slice it, it's a must see, unless you have difficulty with violence.",

        {
            "content": "For the longest time I've wondered what it was about this film that so instantly both clicked with me as much as it has.  To the point that I hold it up as one of my all time favorite movies.  I only saw it for the first time at the beginning of 2013 (in a double feature with \"Braveheart\" which clicked the same way for me, but is not the subject of this review) but watched it quite a few times over the following year.  I guess it's just because for me it does have it all as a movie.  Wonderful production values, a superb cast, viscerally exciting action scenes, and a great story to back it all up.  Like in the case of  other acclaimed Award Winning films of the time that preceded it like \"Braveheart\" and \"The English Patient\" the filmmakers have a clear affinity for the grand epics of Hollywood's Golden Age.  Feeling like love letters to that era so to speak.   One critic calling this film a \"nostalgic synthesis\" of all those that came before.  There is some truth to that, but the way it's all put together is masterfully done in such a way that it stands on its own two feet and comes off as its own tale.  Particularly how it in part tackles a theme/subject that none of those other films touches on.  Which is essentially the power of entertainment.\n\nEverybody has talked up the film's action scenes, cast, and sumptuous production values before.  But what often times gets lost in the shuffle for some is its story, which as I implied before I think more than matches everything else around it.  The film touches on how the entertainment medium has been and is still used by those who seek to misdirect and manipulate the masses.  As Commodus does here with the gladiator games.  Hoping to win the adoration he has felt deprived of (particularly by his father) and also to consolidate his power by subsequently dissolving the senate.  Leaving him unchecked by anybody.  But the thing that I think is disappointing that many people gloss over is Maximus' character arc.  The reason potentially being that it is not presented in a for lack of a better term \"in your face\" sort of way and is surprisingly understated but present for those truly looking at it.  His story is of a great man of strong moral character who loses everything and is torn down to one of the darkest of places.  He wavers, struggles with his humanity, trust (in both others and himself), and faith.  He goes from a great leader (in terms of skill as well as character, given that he's willing to put himself in the same danger as any of his followers as displayed in the opening ) who disdains death (but fights when he feels it's for the greater good), is popular with his peers, and has a loving family waiting for him.  However, Commodus out of jealousy and spite takes it all away.  Resulting him in being nothing more than a slave who has to fight and kill for mere entertainment rather than a true cause.  Becoming (understandably) jaded, cynical, and antisocial.  Even starting out with the plan to die.  However contending with the task of trying to save Rome given to him by his father figure and mentor still hanging over his head.  When many (if not most) people talk about this film, even those who like it, they say Maximus' story comes down to nothing but essentially \"revenge is sweet\".  \n\nAnd I personally feel that that is missing the point and shortchanging the story, as his arc does say something more meaningful than that.  As I was laying out before while the film does not condemn him getting his revenge, as happens in the end, but the factor that's often forgotten is that it is also about him staying true to himself, and ultimately not putting his revenge before the greater good of Rome or those around him. He has opportunities to get his revenge earlier on, but ultimately relents for one reason or another in how it would hurt other things.  Which is all naturally connected to the \"stay true to yourself\" and \"don't let terrible circumstances get the best of you\" facets of his character progression.  He slowly but surely opens up to life again, begins trusting in others once more, as well as proves he can retain his ethics and be true to himself.  He manages to become the great general once again in the arena to his fellow gladiators, befriend men whose people were conquered by the very empire he serves (and was betrayed by),  and ultimately through his actions inspires others to carry on his cause after his death.  In my mind this arc is powerful, universal, and inspiring.  As one should strive to overcome even the greatest obstacles they face in life and not compromise who they are because of them. Early on in the film Maximus says to his men, \"What we do in life, echoes in eternity\" which opens up the theme of how ones actions in life are truly important.  Maximus managing to hold true to that in the end.  \n\nWhat works great is that his strength of character is juxtaposed to others giving into their worst impulses.  Illustrated the most through Commodus in his desperate attempts to win both attention and affection.  Not being able to win the love he wanted before from his father, he seeks to fill the void with that of the people no matter how flaccid it may ultimately be.  And he's willing to throw away human life through the gladiator games in order to achieve this. And was willing to even go so far as to try and \"have\" his sister to fulfil a perverse base/carnal desire of his. But the mob also reflect this in how they eat up the violent spectacle.  \n\nIt is also notable that an arc of getting over one's cynicism and helping the greater good is also paralleled in the character of Proximo as well. In a film about gladiators it would have been really easy to build a loose framework of a plot just to go from one action sequence to another.  Here they went the extra mile and not only developed a great story  around it all, but made it so that the action sequences furthered both the narrative and character progression.  In the end his strength of character and faith are ultimately rewarded, not only with allies continuing his cause but getting to see his wife and son again in the afterlife.  While it is not purely a religious film, that part of it is certainly spiritually astute.",

            "content": "Gladiator (2000)\n\nEpic historical drama is a folkloric sweet candy irrespective of the communication medium. Investigating these age-old tales, finding a right fit character ensemble, outlining a riveting yet befitting story, creating historic environs (graphics + sets) and finally going for filming it is no lesser daunting task for the cast and crew involved.\n\nPlot:\n\nGeneral Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) leads Roman Army to a decisive victory against Germanic tribes making himself a symbol for pride, esteem, valor and leadership. Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) favors the general as a temporary successor to the throne over Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) his own son.\n\nA series of incidents, dominated by fit and rage, lead to the loss of general's family and he gets supplanted in to a world of gladiators fighting for their lives both for existence and entertainment. Rest of the story is about Maximus finding his way back to the empire (but as a gladiator), restoring dead emperor's aspirations and exerting his due share of vengeance. \n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe film is based on real events and characters but not everything depicted is an accurate historical event. The director and story writer enjoyed their fair share of liberty in terms of formatting the plot, choosing characters and giving it a filmy twist. The opening battle sequence, gladiator fights at smaller avenues and final action episodes are simply stunning to say the least. One of the biggest assets for the film is its racy screenplay \u00e2\" in spite of being a historical, screenplay writers left no stone unturned in setting an undying pace to the film.\n\nRidley Scott is a seasoned chap in Hollywood. But with this film he took up a new challenge of spiraling down a periodic stairwell not just for the sake of it. He dumped himself in to Rome's history, emperors during that era, noticeable chain of events and their intrinsic nuances aided by a group of historians. The amazing use of CGI in laying out ancient Rome, it's architecture and a grainy ancient look to the film is spellbinding. \n\nRussell Crowe is so freaking believable as he plays his character to it's skin and teeth. Beginning with his physique he truly looks like a gladiator belonging to that era transcending it down to his fierce antics and extremely ruthless valor. He is extremely good in every frame of the movie giving it the required mood and fervor. If there's a human being filled with fear, treachery, ego and all carnal inflections then it's Commodus - Joaquin plays the character to the best of his abilities.\n\nTail Piece:\n\nIn actuality there is no character called Maximus and the fictional character has been created from original king slayer Narcissus.",

            "content": "The movie moves in the realm of depression and just stays there. Gladiator shows the things that pushed an innocent hero to the point that death seemed like a relief from all that the world has taken from him. Maximus the main protagonist of the movie was portrayed by Russell Crowe in such a talented yet distinctive fashion that you do nothing but bow to the way Maximus handled his trials and tests to come out victorious at the end.\n\nFilming took place between January and May of1999 and the locations used were Bourne Woods, near Farnham Surrey in England, Ouarzazate Morocco and Fort Ricasoli Malta.\n\nThe movie plot is about a loyal Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe), who is betrayed when the Emperor's son, Commodus, murders his father to become Emperor of Rome himself, and burns down and kills Maximus family. After everything is lost Maximus is reduced to slavery and he having one determination, revenge, rose through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena, all in the hope of getting back at the man who killed his family and Emperor. \n\nBased squarely on a pitch by David Franzoni, who worked with Spielberg in Amistad, Ridley Scott was approached to make a movie from Franzoni\u00e2(TM)s original final draft but he had the whole script re-written by John Logan who was the person that added the death of Maximus family, to create a lonely soldier with nothing to lose, but Franzoni was brought back as problems start to erupt in the re-writes, Frazoni did all he could to get the script back to the original draft. More issues sprung up, when Russell Crowe almost caused a total re-write of the script, whenever he asked questions he demanded answers and if the answers were not favourable, the script had to be re-worked.\n\nThe movie can be said to have drawn plot from two older movies, The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus both of which were done in the 60s. A lot of the plot foundation, like the murder of the emperor by his son who wanted to marry his sister, who (Sister) was in love with a General can be said to be taken from the movie The Fall of the Roman Empire. The gladiator aspect of this movie can be said to have been gotten from the movie Spartacus.\n\nGladiator was a critical and financial success and it won 5 Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards, the awards were Best Picture, Best Actor (Russell Crowe), Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design and Best sound.\n\nGladiator is a classic movie that gives you the fun to see the Roman Empire as some believe it was, rough and full of politics, here is another shelf nominee.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

He escapes but is mad a slave and then a gladiator. Through this he gains the respect of the masses and is able to defy Commodus. Over time, Maximus is part of a plot to remove Commodus. Once again the enraged emperor wishes to quash the legend of Maximus forever. He does not win in the end and Maximus has aided Rome. This action-epic had a lot of exciting scenes and a good hero. The score was good too but sometimes it seems as if the cinematography could have been better. This film is reminiscent of the classic epic Spartacus and it was a pretty good in it's own right.",

Describing the characters makes them easily sound like caricatures, but even if they are and the story familiar, the film overcomes this with vibrant storytelling, fantastic performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, visual and technical brilliance (as you would expect from Scott's films), Hans Zimmer's career-best soundtrack, and its irresistible energy and efficiency.

There is no doubt that he made the best picture 90s since the appearance of \"Thelma and Louise\" and some drop even further in the past film career Scott. He returned after failed modern bands \"White Squall\" and \"GI Jane\" again in a different era - in fact all been convinced since the introduction in 1977, an impressive debut \"Duellists\", the place of his Creator in the distant past (it should also be called \"1492: Conquest of Paradise \"and the timeless\" Legend \"), or in the future (which have become classics of the genre of\" Alien \"and\" Blade Runner, \"speak for themselves!).\n\nAnd, apparently, no accident that the Ridley Scott film company \"DrimUorks\", one of whose leaders is Steven Spielberg, is also now interested in history along with fiction, entrusted the task of reviving the responsible one time (in the late 50's and 60's) almost not the most popular genre of historical films about ancient Rome, in other words - \"peplum\". This does not mean that in the next forty years, stopped to shoot pictures of antiquity, but more often than not on television or not with such a powerful budget of $ 103 million, as in \"Gladiator.\" And then be sure to take into account the parsimony spilbergovskih producers who know how not to waste money and, in particular, do not invite too expensive stars, believing that the \"take out the material.\" And it actually happened - just 17 days only in the U.S. tape Scott collected an amount equal to the budget, and eventually got to the world $ 457.6 million, that is 4.5-times the cost of production.\n\nCredits \"Gladiator\" managed importantly, what he doubted, and the company \"DrimUorks\" and \"Yuniversl\" big risk that the amount of money spent will not be returned. Ridley Scott has made fun and exciting spectacle for the modern audience, more used to the fantastic special effects (as, for example, in the scene of the races in the distant future in the film \"Star Wars. Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace\"), that old-fashioned, it would seem, style, historical superkolossov that predominated two generations ago. Teenagers and young men like Scott himself, who once could run in cinemas in large-scale screen surface Cecil Blount DeMille (\"The Ten Commandments\"), William Wyler (\"Ben Hur\"), Stanley Kubrick (\"Spartacus\") and Joseph Leo Mankiewicz (\" Cleopatra \"), now became a grandfather. Their sons (such as Jake Scott in \"Plunkett & Macleane\") managed to show the distant past with a grain of salt, do not really care about historical accuracy.\n\nIt may seem that senior Scott is not burdened task always to fidelity era, showing the battle in Germany, such as the bloody battles in the \"Conan the Barbarian\", scene of gladiatorial combats in North Africa - in the manner of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" and fight in the Coliseum with chariots - as if competing with already mentioned episodes races in the film by George Lucas. The director of \"Gladiator\" really conquered the audience with his powerful ability to create etched in my memory battle scenes and moments of gladiatorial combat. But he also seemed to compensate for weaknesses in the first part of the story, making up close to the climax of acute spiritual confrontation between the two main characters.\n\nMaxim was the leader of the victorious legionaries, escaped the deadly persecution of the authorities of Rome and forced to become a gladiator. A latter-day emperor Commodus not only ignored the precepts of his father, the great Caesar, Marcus Aurelius, but at the cost of its destruction and usurpation to the throne. The last fight in the arena of personal Maxim and Commodus - the contest is not for life or death, and even the fate of Rome, and the typical creative Ridley Scott supramundane allegorical clash between good and evil. Mortally wounded, he can cause Maxim inevitable blow to the enemy, bless the transfer of power to the Senate, and then retire to his recent dreams to the other world, where it is long overdue wife and son were brutally tortured soldiers Commodus.\n\nThis should be evidence of the logical continuation of the constant motif skottovskogo vosparenii from brute reality unimaginable limits of otherness. But whether the artist was tired of fighting with Hollywood for twenty years, Lee said his loss of the right tone of stories in previous works, \"White Squall\" and \"GI Jane,\" that if this historical material has nothing to do with the author's desire to ascend certainly in mountain sphere ... In any case, these episodes, painted in mystical colors manifestly alien and also strained met. With hardly doubt that this notion of the director, and not the imposition of the will of the producers, as some overly pathetic scenes. This is a pity, that in this situation the European author with a reputation bright visionary seer and outright lost himself as a master of American professionals superzrelisch. That this is so is confirmed by the highest score box office ever had to hire Ridley Scott.",

            "content": "Well there a lot of Best Picture winner that my brothers own that I wanted to watch and review before they go back to college for the fall. And since the younger brother is going back sooner then the other, I thought I'd get his Best Picture movies out of the way. So I'm starting that with Gladiator.\r\n\r\nPlot: Maximus is the general of the roman army in 180 A.D. where in the beginning of the film, he had just finished a battle against the Germanic. Shortly after the battle, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, asks Maximus to temporarily leadership of Rome when he's gone and to use it to return power to the senate of Rome, despite the fact that he has a son named Commodus. When Commodus find about about this, he murder his father and claims the throne, and then orders his men to kill Maximus and his wife and son back at his farm. Maximus escapes, but he rides home to find his family already dead and crucified. After he buries them, he is found unconscious by slave-traders who take him to Zucchabar, where he is forced to fight as a Gladiator.\r\n\r\nNow I thought this movie was pretty darn good when I saw it a few years ago. But seeing it again...it's entertaining but it's still not that spectacular. I mean they seem to do an alright job in giving us the world of Rome from that time and some historical accuracy on a few levels for characters like Commodus and Lucilla, and the action was entertaining and more or less realistic looking. But the story was not all that impressive and most the characters were possibly a little too serious. I mean it had one light moment that I can think of, but it was all that big. I know it's a drama, but most of the dramatic stuff was not displayed all that well outside of just being serious as they say their lines.\r\n\r\nActors/Characters\r\nRussel Crowe/Maximus: Of the actors that was a little too focuses on just being so serious, I would say Crowe did that the most. I mean sure he goes through a lot of stuff that are the whole reason for why he does that, but I think there were point where he could've done more then that. Like when he was crying when he saw the crucified bodies of his family; I liked one or two things he did to show Maximus' pain over the matter but on a while, I thought he was mostly displaying the same serious face only that he had his mouth a little wider or something around that.\r\nJuaquin Phoenix/Commodus: I thought he was the best in terms of acting honestly. Because even though he was mostly serious too, he displayed much more emotion and sometimes even movement that helped him really display how Commodus is cowardly, ruthless and power hungry.\r\n\r\nMusic: I enjoyed the music a lot. My favorite tracks would be in most of the action music. I use to on soundtrack all the time when I was a kid long before I first watched this movie and it's just has a nice sense of adventure when it plays. \r\n\r\nEditing: Most of it is okay but there were a couple of things that I didn't like. Mostly how in a lot of the action scenes, especially in the first battle of the movie, there would be times where they're randomly showing a shot that's kind of in slow-motion or would keep cutting to shots where they're way too close up and the camera is shaking a lot. They have their points with stuff like that but I think it was a little much for both the slow-motion and the shaking cameras.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for Gladiator. It's not the best with acting or story, but you can still enjoy it anyway with some decent history accuracy and some good battles scenes.",

All a man can do is smile back\".\n\nThe story is about a man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back, and gain the freedom of his people, in this epic historical drama from director Ridley Scott. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences.\n\nFor once the Oscars got something right with giving Best Picture to Gladiator and well deserved it was. I remember watching this movie and getting goosebumps from the epic fights scenes and the timeless quotes the characters say. You can rather hate or love this movie and if you hate this movie that's fine, I'm not like one of those ass-holes that will yell at people because they didn't like this one movie I like, listen you probably got good reason to dislike the movie, at least you got you're reasons, But for me I loved it.",
