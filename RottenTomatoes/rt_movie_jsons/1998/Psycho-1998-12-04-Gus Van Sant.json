    "summary": "Hoping for a fresh start with her broke boyfriend, Marion (Anne Heche) steals a huge sum from her boss and skips town, eventually stopping at a remote motel. There, she's served by the intensely awkward yet docile Norman Bates (Vince Vaughn), whom she often hears arguing with his domineering mother. But later that night, Marion is brutally slain, and Norman finds and hides the body. When a detective and Marion's sister visit the motel to investigate, they uncover shocking truths.",

            "content": "After these past few days of exploring the range of quality that is the Psycho sequels, whether or not I really wanted to see the Gus Van Sant remake played on my mind. The completionist part of me got the better of me and here I am, having watched it. The Psycho Experiment as Van Sant and others now refer to it as is a very strange beast, it's one of a select few official shot-for-shot remakes to ever be championed and yet it still contains its fair share of differences from the original.\n\nThere are slight differences in terms of visuals, minor plot details, updated elements of the screenplay, the contemporary setting and subsequent inflation of the stolen money; Van Sant added several surreal subliminal images edited into the film's murder sequences almost like memory fragments flashing in front of characters' eyes as they die. The use of colour and heightened violence due to an increase in movies made circa 1998 don't gel well with the source material and certain moments performed by the cast fundamentally change the meaning of certain scenes, ergo the infamous eye through the wall peep going from simple observation to full on masturbation. While Bernard Herrmann's musical score is reused, the new stereo recordings made by Danny Elfman and Steve Bartek are often mistimed with where the original cue placements were.\n\nThe casting of Vince Vaughan as Norman Bates has to be one of the biggest miscastings in movie history, he is unable to capture that same secret pool of madness that Perkins had done so effortlessly. Anne Heche woefully overacts her way through the movie and turns Marion into a completely different character. Julianne Moore as Lila is much more aggressive in comparison to Vera's portrayal in the original but does turn in a good performance, paired with Viggo Mortensen as Sam, the two try and rescue the film from its amateur dramatics vibe. The standout of the film is definitely William H. Macy's Arbogast, staying true to Martin Balsam's original performance yet making it his own with ease.\n\nNothing about Gus Van Sant's Psycho improves nor illuminates Hitchcock's original, somehow Van Sant managed to convince someone at Universal to greenlight this, bringing about an artful and somewhat faithful remake... Who am I kidding? It's straight-up plagiarism.",

And boy was this experiment a disaster!  One of the worst film's ever made.  The concept here is just assinine and idiotic.  What was the point of a shot-for-shot remake?  Particularly of such a classic?!!   You might as well have just colorized the original!  So stupid this; it's  impossible to overcome with any solid work by Anne Heche, Julianne Moore or William H. Macy.  (Party boy comedian Vince Vaughn is horribly miscast as Norman Bates; not at all convincing as the tightly wound eponymous psychopath.   I can see Joaquin Phoenix playing this role much more effectively; or Ralphe Fiennes; or anyone else.)   It's too bad Van Sant's temporary lunacy here will be etched on his tombstone; probably the first thing to be mentioned in his obituaries right after his successes with Good Will Hunting and My Own Private Idaho.  Did Van Sant learn anything from his mistake?  Not really.  When asked about it recently; he defiantly said; \"oh I thought it was great!  I think I'll remake Psycho every ten years or so from now on!\" Some mavericks never learn.",

But if any such people exist, I implore them not to start here. \n\nThe biggest problem with Van Sant's remake is the cast. Vince Vaughn looks too good to be a psycho. He looks like he's been working out at a Hollywood gym, whereas Tony Perkins was thin and nerdy---and far more naturalistically creepy. Anne Heche is merely passable, not memorable, as the unfortunate Marion Crane. Julianne Moore is simply flat, nearly lifeless as Marion's sister. \n\nEven though the film is supposed to be an exact shot-by-shot remake, Van Sant can't resist embellishing things with nudity and excess blood. He even screws up the shower scene with unnecessary shots outside of the bathroom. \n\nThis film is not a total disaster, but nobody can ever hope to equal the original.  Forget it.",

Finally bothered.\nNot entirely rat feces, but might as well be, I'll now go over why in precise detail.\nCelebrity cast wasted, from what there is. From what there... isn't, Vaughn almost always botches the most iconic Bates scenes, Moore reaches a lot and ironically couldn't scream well enough to save her own life, and worst of all, Heche ranging from the horribly unperiodic costumes to her ridiculous make-up job and back to her horrendous portrayal of the star victim, looks so horrible that I couldn't tell any worse if she had been ejected from a dinosaur's rectum, had the best plastic surgeon on call 24-7, and still come out looking like Kim Kardashian's (who looks like a diseased mannequin on heroine) stunt double.\nAnd this farce almost pales in the face of stupid changes or, rather, lack of said change that ends up trading a car for a rust bucket almost a decade old to the year the movie takes place / came out, had the wrong change for a pay phone (should've been 35c, I would know), actually skipping important parts of conversations (like an early tip off, say, the sheriff's wife being confused and thinking Norman had found himself a woman), to the logical but seriously blasphemous of the sacrosanct, turning Bates into a literal wanker, on film, that still keeps his childhood Playboys around. As if it isn't bad enough that Vaughn botches the shower clean up, the almost apoplectic but contained fury during the \"somewhere\" scene, can't come across like he's winging it with Arbogast while getting grilled (acts more silver-tongued honestly, like he rehearsed it... moron), repeatedly overkills his \"shut up\" lines... hell, he doesn't even get the famous \"we all go mad sometimes\" bit right. How messed up is that?\nLast but not least, throw in the fact that Lina actually flirts with Norman, and Norman acts progressively more feminine as the movie wears on--you know, I could forgive things like changing Norman's personality, etc, if you intended a real remake to begin with. But no, you replicate as much as the original as you can. As if the original movie could say, \"Am I a joke to you?\" It's not so much that the movie is JUST a sham, it IS an insult too.

It's not entirely his fault since by '98 he hadn't been in the numerous comedies that prevent me from taking him seriously as a dramatic actor, but it's at least partially on him with that grating fake laugh of his. I really don't think he's ever genuinely laughed in his life. Otherwise, I had found the source material supremely ripe and worthy of being dwelled upon; I enjoyed the TV show and both Perkins sequels, and I sat through this movie with no complaints whatsoever. I especially liked the casting as they really did an excellent job (outside of Vaughn) with their choices here, even if it is mildly surprising that they all agreed to do this.",

Not so much for its content, but for the simple fact that it's a remake of a popular masterpiece, and I guess if a film is considered a classic then you aren't allowed to remake it. Gus Van Sant was doomed from the start with this one. Audiences went in already having their minds made up, that they hated it. It's a remake of an Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece, so by default it's terrible. In the hands of any other director, it definitely could have been. The violence and gore would have been increased to satisfy modern film goers blood lust. Gratuitous sex and nudity would have been included. Atmosphere and building dread would have been replaced with cheap jump scares. Instead, Gus Van Sant took the film in a completely different direction, he essentially used the original film as a blue print, and made a nearly shot for shot carbon copy. But not exactly. Gus Van Sant brought his own vision to the proceedings, and as similar as this Psycho is, it's also distinctly dissimilar. The psychosexual aspects of the film are explored more, subliminal imagery is intercut into key sequences, adding an extra level of creepiness and depth to the psychological themes. The flamboyant style is used to great effect, adding even more to enjoy to the film. If you separate this as just 'that awful remake of Psycho' and accept the film on its own terms, it is stylish, unique, and a fresh approach to  the material. The casting is also inspired, but is probably the weakest aspect of the film. While William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are great in their roles, even better than the performances in the original, Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn pale in comparison. They are not bad, Heche is actually striking here, she's always been underrated in my opinion, and she certainly makes the character her own. But what actress could have bested Janet Leigh's iconic turn? As for Vaughn, he certainly can't be faulted for a lack of trying, and he's certainly not bad, but Anthony Perkins will always be the ONLY Norman Bates, and simply no other actor out there could ever replace him. Still, Vaughn was a strange choice, and I think there are many better actors out there that could have done something special that Vaughn misses here. With that said, Gus Van Sant's Psycho is underrated, and was unfairly ripped to shreds. It's a different take on the source material, and in many ways, is one of the better horror remakes out there. Unfortunately, it will always be regarded as 'that shitty remake that was entirely pointless.' Whatever, I love it.",

            "content": "This nearly shot-for-shot remake of the original \"Psycho\" is a failure, but a fascinating one that I'm sort of glad exists. \n\nThere are few things I can compliment the movie for. Gus Van Sant and crew do get most of the shots done the exact same way as the original, though the inclusion of color makes some of them less exciting. On a technical level it's hard to fault, but it's hard to praise either since they did nothing new with the story. \n\nThe only absolutely horrible thing technically is the sound music. Bernard Herrmann's classic score is still used in most of the same places as the original, but it's also put in a few places where it doesn't need to be. There are also a few songs added to this remake which are used in the worst places possible. The ending scene, already the least important scene from the original, is made worse since the music drowns out everything the doctor (Robert Forster) is saying. \n\nThe acting and direction is where the film really falls flat, though. In trying to imitate the original performances rather than bring a new interpretation to the stories or characters, most of the actors come across as wooden and the line delivery is off more often than not. Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche are the worst offenders, though it's probably more Van Sant's fault. Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and Viggo Mortensen give it a good go, but they don't add any new layers to the characters we already know too well from the original.\n\nAs I said before, I'm kind of glad this film exists as a cautionary tale to any other misguided filmmakers of the future who think a shot-for-shot remake would be a good idea. It wouldn't. Remakes are rarely a good idea, and they only work when they bring a new interpretation to the story. \n\nThis \"Psycho\" is interesting enough to watch if you've seen the original and want to see people try and fail to recapture its magic. I was just as glued to the screen with this one than the last one, but more because I wanted to see the minor changes from the original. I actually recommend fans of the original to watch this soon after a viewing of the first. It will make you appreciate Hitchcock's masterpiece even more.",

Scriptwise, some ineffective updates have been made to make some of the dialogue and actions more contemporary (Bates masturbates, how unusual!), but these changes seem pointless when the 1960 film, which found brilliant ways to sidestep censorship, has been recreated so closely. Would Hitchcock, had he lived to make the film in 1998, not chosen a more direct approach to  Bates' violent manifestations of his twisted mentality? To make matters worse, \"the house\" just does not look the part, at all.

No matter how startlingly faithful, a remake of a critical hit has to figure out some way to tick people off, and sure enough, whoever thought to cast Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates as Norman Bates must be a psycho... is something that I would expect to be said by someone who didn't see \"Clay Pigeons\" the same year this film came out. Well, actually, I'm probably the only guy who thought that Vaughn was awesome in that film, but either way, the point is that they could have gotten a worse person to play an iconic serial murderer. Shoot, looking at how much Vaughn's Lester Long character was obsessed with Joaquin Phoenix's Clay Bidwell character, I'm thinking that he was trying to cover something up with his womanizing, and that this is both a continuation of \"Clay Pigeons\" and of Gus Van Sant's efforts to innovate gay drama filmmaking. Oh, if only this film was that much of a departure from the themes of its source material, but this remake is so overtly close to the original \"Psycho\" that Van Sant had the audacity to even make a crowbarred cameo at the same point in the story in which Alfred Hitchcock made a crowbarred cameo. You know, come to think of it, forget Vaughn, because I'm wondering how the guy who did \"Good Will Hunting\", of all people, ended up being the one to remake \"Psycho\", but don't worry people, because the only big difference between this production and the original is the fact that, instead of the woman playing Marion Crane, the director was probably flirting with Viggo Mortensen... something that I probably can't blame him too much on (Hey, comparing him to Vince Vaughn, just try to ignore the good lucks). Well, that's a distinction, as is this film's being by no means as good as the original, for a couple reasons.\r\n\r\nEven if you take out of account this film's sticking a little too close to its original, or if you actually take into account how many films since the original have stuck to its tropes, this particular thriller is mighty lacking in originality, falling into convention after convention and molding, even for that, like, one guy who isn't familiar with this narrative, a predictable path that isn't even tight. This film isn't about five minutes shorter than the original, but then again, if the original did outstay its welcome, it wasn't by only five minutes, thus, this film has a tendency to drag its feet, particularly with a first half that, like the original, is too distinct from the second in character focus for the transition to feel organic, exacerbating a sense of aimlessness. Really, the sheer dragging, only occasionally accompanied by atmospheric dry spells, proves to be rather detrimental to the momentum of this film, but probably not much more than it was to the momentum of the original, whose quality wouldn't define this film's so much if, well, this film didn't obviously want you to draw comparisons. I have a certain admiration to this film for having so much respect for its source material, and for simply being unique in its degree of faithfulness, but really, this remake is plain and simple too much like the original, and while that would leave you to figure that this film is about the same quality as its rewarding source material, the faithfulness actually holds some of a lazy quality. There's something bland about the lack of liberalism to this revisiting of Alfred Hitchcock's classic, and when liberties are taken to try and bring this subject matter closer to the modern horror industry that its source material actually heavily influenced, the modernist audacity clashes with the old-fashioned flavors in a way that begets tonal unevenness, maybe even something of a cheesy feel. This film is both overambitious and safe, and that's not a very good combination if you aim to do justice to such worthy subject matter, ultimately given enough respect for a decent effort to be crafted, but not with the sense of uniqueness, tightness and consistency that carried the original so far. This particular film is ultimately too bland to stand a chance of transcending underwhelmingness, but its roots are worthy, and a celebration of such roots makes it hard to dislike this endeavor, particularly when it works to at least impress stylistically.\r\n\r\nWhile one might be a little excited to see this film brought to the wonderful world of color, the intentional black-and-white palette of the original not only better defined the subject matter's bleak tone, but was backed by a slightly sharper filming style, and yet, partly because it's so faithful to the filming of its original, this film's visual style is pretty slick, with well-polished highlights to Christopher Doyle's cinematography that add to the visual style, just as Danny Elfman's cleaner, more modernist adaptation of Bernard Herrmann's legendary score adds to the biting musical style of the original. Well, the slight stylistic adjustments only slightly add to the original's aesthetic value, if they do at all, but the fact of the matter is that there is some sharp style here to, just as it did in the original, breathe some life into some worthy subject matter. While it's gotten to be overexplored enough over the years by films that weren't note-for-note, if not shot-for-shot homages, this story dealing with a hunt for a troubled woman that eventually leads to a hunt for a disturbed man is still pretty compelling, and the classic script by Joseph Stefano, while losing a bit of juice in the process of being recycled with little uniqueness, is still gutsy in a lot of ways, particularly with its well-rounded drawing of memorable characters. Quite frankly, the characters are done about as much justice as anything in this film, thanks to a solid, if questionably selected cast of talents who prove to be worthy fillers of worthy shoes, particularly, of all people, Vince Vaughn, for although Vaughn doesn't retain that impeccable mixture of thorough charisma and chilling intensity which made the Lester Long character of \"Clay Pigeons\" so effective to compensate for his simply not being quite as dramatically realized as Anthony Perkins, he captures the iconic Norman Bates character's nervous instability enough to sell the chilling presence of such an iconic antagonist. Not even the performances in this film are quite as sharp as they were in 1960, yet they're still about as consistent as anything in driving the engagement value of this thriller, which isn't to say that there isn't a certain offscreen performance that also does a lot to endear. No matter how hard Gus Van Sant works to emulate Alfred Hitchcock, horror just simply isn't his game, so even without the blandness of conventionalism, this film was never to stand a chance of being as effective as the original, yet Van Sant is still a talented storyteller, thus, when he hits, he hits reasonably hard with establishing chills which punctuate a consistent degree of entertainment value. No matter how much the film may be blanded up by questionable pacing and wholly derivative storytelling, it's plenty entertaining, if nothing else, and when entertainment value goes matched with effectiveness, the final product is left to emerge as pretty decent, if improvable.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the film falls into too many tropes, too many draggy spells and focal inconsistencies, and too deeply into its source material, only with a few modernist beats that unevenly clash with some of the more old-fashioned attributes to transcend underwhelmingness which thrives on blandness, yet there is still enough appeal to the style, writing, acting - particularly by Vince Vaughn - and direction to make Gus Van Sant's \"Psycho\" an entertaining and sometimes effective revisiting of a classic thriller, despite boasting much in the way of unrealized potential.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Definitely not as good as the original - but this movie gave more info about the characters that i overlooked while watching the original.  i did not realize how immature Norman is in his logic and his integrity.  Vince does a good job in building the character and demonstrating the child like mind of Norman along with the emotional shifts to his multiple personalities.  i liked the majoriy of the movie, but think that they missed out on some of the lessons that Hitchcock gave us on his grand slam of an ending from the original. i think the ending should have been more swift and less theatrical. The twist around of the chair with the mother should have focused on the shock of the mother being dead and less on the gore of the life likeness of the dead mothers features.  the thrill of the movie is when you learn that the mother is dead and that norman dresses up as his mother and does the actual killing.  its not so much the realness of the special effects, the more simpler and quicker the better.  the spider was pretty gross but was not neccesary.",

            "content": "Honestly, I only watched Gus Van Sant's Psycho remake to realise the futility of shot-for-shot remakes, and considering it's a remake of a horror classic, its one of the stupidest lines to walk. Gus Van Sant walked it for some reason, and I watched Psycho to realise how far he made it.\n\nAlthough Gus Vant Sant does a somewhat decent job mimicking the style of the original Psycho shot-for-shot, its an unnecessary creation to begin with, and some of the first things on screen prove that Psycho is set up to fail, namely the sight of actress Anne Heche.\nAnne Heche is not a good choice for the role of Marion Crane. She doesn't have the characteristics that fitted the role for Janet Leigh, because she is 29 and shows it easily. She looks a lot younger than she is and it makes her seem like an almost teenage girl was the character to commit the crimes that the famous character did. Her look, combined with the look of other characters and general atmosphere of a contemporary timeframe is not just unconvincing, and not befitting to the story or to the classical film style which Alfred Hitchcock created and Gus Van Sant attempts to follow. Most of the first half of Psycho was focused on varying shots of Anne Heche's face, and it serves as a constant reminder of the poor choices made in the film's production. Also, since the original Psycho was in black-and-white, the scenes seemed a lot more grim. Now the whole atmosphere is so damned light and the characters are dressed so brightly that Psycho has the atmosphere of a romantic-comedy. And if you only watched the first part of the film it would be easy for you to believe that.\nAnd Vince Vaughn serves as a double entendre to Anthony Perkins, because his portrayal of Norman Bates is burdened by the film's light atmosphere which causes viewers to reflect on him based on his roles in the various comedy films he made in the 2000's which makes him also wrong for the part, regardless of how he tries. He doesn't convey the level of creepiness that Anthony Perkins could, and if anything he just fits into being a perverted man. This isn't right. This isn't right at all.\nGus Van Sant's decision to attempt to make Psycho a \"neo-thriller\" as I would call it causes him to incorporate in several elements not acceptable in the original film and therefore inappropriate in a remake, particularly one that is shot-for-shot. These particular elements come in around 40 minutes into the film at a climactic moment, where Gus Van Sant decides to show elements of nudity in the film and make Norman Bates masturbate loudly enough for us to hear. The latter is sickening for him to do to Norman Bates because it stereotypes him as a sick pervert instead of as a mentally damaged man like he was in the original, and when you change a character around who is a very famous figure in cinematic history for an already crappy remake, that's going too far. And in terms of the nudity, although Anne Heche is in fact hot in Pscho and sexy when she's showing off her body, it not only doesn't fit the context of the beautiful and sophisticated Janet Leigh whose portrayal of Marion Crane characterised her as a troubled woman going out on a limb while Anne Heche conveys the idea that she's just a little girl stealing money from daddy for her boyfriend, but it also doesn't fit the context of the fact that the original Pscvho got away with hiding its nudity in clever secretive ways, while Gus Van Sant flaunts Anne Heche's body in minor ways to what he thinks is the benefit of the film. Unfortunately, it is, because Psycho is so terrible that the only images I'm likely to remember from it is Anne Heche's ass as she leans over the bathtub, or her breasts as Vince Vaughn watches her through a peephole. But in any normal case it just fails to transcend the quality of the film or the original, and is just poor form, as is much of the films poor editing.\nThe script seems poor, even if much of it is derived from the original script. Particular elements weren't which aren't strong script moments, while lines that are sourced from the original Psycho are delivered poorly by the cast, and that's just insulting to the man Alfred Hitchcock was when he wrote the original clever script and directed his masterpiece which Gus Van Sant has attempted to destroy.\nWith poor direction and a mismatched cast, Psycho is set up to fail. They all try, and Anne Heche comes out on the other side as the best of all of them because she can act but the character Marion Crane isn't right for her. Gus Van Sant just brings everybody down and wastes $60 million in the process. Even his recreation of the famous shower scene is terrible, and you can actually see Vince Vaughn in blackface there which destroys the credibility of Psycho even more.\n\nWhat few benefits there are aside from Anne Heche's body and the good cinematography is mainly some of the cast members.\nWilliam H. Macy does a good job as usual as he has a natural acting talent, but why his death scene has random images being flashed on screen is beyond me, and it all looks too fake and unconvincing. Still, he manages to shine a light on this grim failure of a movie.\nAnd Julianne Moore is a genial presence as always, and although her screen time is very short and she isn't challenged as an actress at all, she does a decent job.\nPhillip Baker Hall is also good as usual, and Robert Forster does a decent job wrapping the story up.\n\nBut aside from Anne Heche's body and the cast members of Boogie Nights, Psycho is otherwise just a fine example of a terrible remake of a classic film which disintegrates as it fails to develop through its 100 minutes of running time.",

            "content": "The 1960 Hitchcock film Psycho is renowned for being one of the best horror films of all time. It's a truly unique entry into cinema that stands out especially when compared to the dull remakes we're bombarded with these days. However, remakes of films often times get passed off as shit before they're even given a chance, purely based on the loyalty of the audience to the original. The bigger the fanbase, the more the remake gets torn apart. Which means that 1998's Psycho had no chance in hell of getting very many good reviews. Often times any changes or artistic liberties that the director takes in these movies are reprimanded by hundreds of screaming fanboys saying that he/she pissed all over the original. We don't like things different, but isn't that the point of a remake? To offer a new perspective or different version of a classic story and its characters. Luckily/Unluckily 1998's Psycho takes very few liberties, mainly because it's a shot for shot, line for line remake, but without the tension, power, or style of the original. It's a fascinating example that serves as a martyr for directors who like to shake things up in remakes.\nPsycho (1998) and Psycho (1960) share 90% of their shots, 90% of their writing and about 30% of their quality. To see why the copy and paste format doesn't work, one merely needs to watch about 30 seconds past the identical opening credits. The film steals the Re-animator music, I mean reuses the old Psycho score and opens on a beautiful helicopter shot of Pheonix, Arizona. What's not beautiful is the awkward feeling you get looking at 1990s Pheonix, and more specifically a 1990s movie, while listening to the overdramatic 60s score. The entire movie mashes together 60s and 90s filmmaking, but instead of creating a retro experience creates an awkward clusterfuck. You can't use a 90s camera and use 60s cinematography. Sure it works fine a good chunk of the time, but Hitchcock's more iconic and stylistic shots are so foreign in 90s cinema that it's hard to look at. It's not helped by the gaudy lighting, which is far too bright and glowy, not using shadows at all. There should be some forgiveness since this is filmed in color and even in the 90s lighting specialists who knew how to light Black and White style were rare, however this film doesn't even try, instead going for an overly contrasted light scale that doesn't end up creating dark shadows, but just creates bathrooms that look like the gateway to heaven.\nAnother of the major 60s/90s conflicts that dominate this movie involves the acting. The dialogue is almost entirely copied from the original, with only a few 90s twists to replace the 60s would-be-anachronisms. The actors struggle monumentally with this dialogue, often times delivering flat performances. It's clear the director is trying to go for the 60s acting style, but none of these actors were trained that way and can't pull it off. What we're left with is a weird mix of hamming to the camera and bland performances. There is also a lot of miscasting in this movie, but the most blatant of them is Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates. Vince Vaughn is not the guy for this role. He's funny, outgoing guy and completely without any of the neuroses that Anthony Perkins had and brought to the role. He isn't even physically built for the character, being far too bulky. When Norman showed up in the original he completely stole the movie and it wasn't until he left the screen that the audience realized that the whole stealing plot was a thing. Vaughn has none of this power, instead leaving you bored and confused by what he's trying to do. Instead of portraying Norman Bates he's portraying Anthony Perkins portraying Norman Bates, but to be fair everyone in this movie copies their predecessor and all of them fail miserably.\nThere's not much left to say about this film, mainly because this film doesn't have much to it. I've been harsher on this movie then others because it's almost completely void of creativity. Sure it has its own moments, but everything it adds is superfluous garbage, failing to bring anything to the movie. The last thing I needed was to hear Vince Vaughn jerk off and I most certainly did not need to have random artistic images thrown at my face, especially if Hitchcock didn't think it pertinent. It's not worth anyone's time. Anyone who has seen Psycho (1960) has already seen this movie and anyone who hasn't would be a thousand times better off watching the original since this one can only taint your enjoyment of that.",

Alfred Hitchcock's horror masterpiece is not only one of the best horror films ever made, but when it was made it went against the rules and regulations of filmmaking. Gus Van Sant's film is basically a shot-for-shot remake, meaning that all of the camera angles are the same, as is the music (which in this film reworked by Danny Elfman) and the lines are also the same, reworked a little bit to match the 1990s setting. Everything with this film is off.\n\nThe cast cannot work against the classic's. Vince Vaughn isn't as menacing as Anthony Perkins, while Anne Heche's depiction of Marion Crane has the character seem a little bit more like an idiot at times, as opposed to Janet Leigh's fierce depiction of the character from the original. Viggo Mortensen, William H. Macy and Julianne Moore also seem out of place.\n\nAnother thing about the original is that Hitchcock had it do things which went against the censors. Never before had a toilet been seen on screen, while the film opening with a man and woman in bed seemed a little taboo. With this version though it's nothing new. Also the idea of having Norman Bates masturbating when viewing Marion Crane getting undressed seems unneeded and forced.\n\nThe end result proves why most remakes are unneeded and why it is also pointless to remake a classic film. Please directors, take this as an example.",

Well, this version is hardly changed. One might then argue that this \"update\" is wasteful or unneeded. These claims are grounded, however Van Sant's Psycho is not attempting to \"update\" or \"remake\" Psycho. Film is still a relatively young art form. Being right around a hundred years old or so, depending on how you view the beginning of film, we most likely have yet to see the greatest film that will ever be made. Movies have yet to truly define themselves. What is their purpose? Are they art? Entertainment? Or something between? Are the primarily escapist? Or are they a manifestation of  horrid flaws in society? The answer depends on what movie and who is at the helm, but the point is, movies are still in their infancy when compared to other media of art. Who's to say that this imitative love letter to Hitchcock's great film is a bad thing? Directors for the stage have interpreted Hamlet in many different ways. Romeo and Juliet has been done in different ways and in different media. One can argue that this is non-applicable to films because the script isn't the whole of the artist's work such as in a play. The direction, costumes, music, actor's performances and all other sorts of things play into the work of art. This is true and obviously Van Sant has taken this into account. The shots mostly are left in tact. Bernard Hermann's historic score still stabbing away at Marion Crane in the shower, and most of the pacing of the dialogue is delivered similarly. This movie is analogous to a high school performance of Shakespeare. It isn't done with the same mastery, but it serves as a way of honoring a great piece of art. In short, while this version of Psycho lacks the tension and Hitchcockian black-magic of the original, it certainly provides a new way to look at films, which is something I'd say is pretty important.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying this: Van Sant's remake of 'Psycho' is not a terrible movie.  That is quite impossible as it is so closely related to the original.  However, because it is nearly shot by shot of the original, you can't help comparing the two in every single aspect of presentation.  And when you do that, this version suffers horrifically.  The original Psycho is, it's a fact, it's there, we've seen it.  Why do a remake unless you're going to make it your own.  There's no point in doing a shot by shot. But, don't think that this movie is only unworthy when compared to the original, if I were truely comparing the two, my score for this film would be 1 star.  On its own, however, I'd give it 2 1/2.  Now let's start the critique:  The movie is in color, which is a bad choice.  I'm not merely saying this because the original is in black and white, even though when compared, there's no question that black and white is just better.  The Motel looks like any other Motel, especially with the bright red neon lights.  And the house, a sort of pukish redish orange, is equally comical.  There's no sense of ominousity that there would have been if they'd done it in black and white.  Now the cinematography is the same in the original, so I must compare the two.  The cinematography in the original was designed for a black and white movie, all the camera shots and lighting were specifically created to puncuate the photography, therefore, using the same cinematography doesn't quite work for this version because it's in color.  The lighting isn't ominous, the camera angles aren't eccentuating what the film has to offer.  Now, the music is the same way, pulled directly from the original film.  But, the original film was in black and white, and Bernard Hermann chose to use all strings because of that.  The music doesn't quite work when the film is brought to color.  They should have reorchestrated the music to include brass and percussion.  Now, let's focus on the actors for a minute: Anne Heche does a fine job as Marion.  At times she overdoes it, but on the whole, it's a fine performance.  And the only one.  Vince Vaughn attempts the impossible at trying to play Norman Bates, granted it's not entirely his fault he can't get it right, but alot of times it is.  Even if you're acting a part that is immortal, you can still make it believable.  Vaughn puts on his acting face and I never quite believed anything he was doing.  I was excited at first seeing Julianne Moore, but she rushes through her dialogue that she becomes just as unconvincing as Vaughn.  William H. Macy was a misfire, as was Viggo Mortensen.  The weird thing about this 'Psycho' is where the humor is concerned.  Macy and Vaughn don't seem like they're having any fun at all in their scene together, which should be the funniest scene in the film.  However, Moore seems to be having the time of her life when she's being attacked by Vaughn, putting all her feminist hilarity into kicking him in the face.  Overall, all of the performances, including the horrible voice over of 'Mother' were a complete misfire.  Now, the shower scene is an immortal scene from the original.  If your going to do a mostly shot by shot remake, why would you not keep intact the integrity of the shower scene?  There is a big pause after Mother opens the curtain where Marion takes time to process that there's someone there before any music or stabbing or screaming happens.  Very awkward.  And then, three immortal shots are left out or changed:  The shot of Marion's hand sliding down the wall is completely left out.  The shot of Marion falling to the floor is changed so that we can have a buttshot, and the tilt of the camera zooming away from the eye is replaced with a massive twirling of the camera around the eye.  Not dramatic at all.  Now, after all that, there were a few things I enjoyed:  Viggo Mortensen's nude scene.  I only wished it showed more.  And the birds in the cellar.  Oh, and I'd like to say that Rita Wilson gives the worst performance of her career.  That said, it is fun to compare the two films and to bash on the completely nonscary elements in this version.  Go and watch the original.",

A director known for some good movies punishes us film lovers with a scene-for-scene, shot-for-shot, line-for-line remake that does everything horribly wrong. A cast of talented names are all badly cast, some of them not even fitting the roles and others seeming to show no interest in bringing life to their characters. Vince Vaughn is not menacing in the slightest bit as Norman Bates, and Viggo Mortensen is the wrong choice for Sam Loomis as he turns him into an almost country-like hick.

So when people complain about the many horror remakes we get today, one should be forced to look at this and realize that we are lucky to be getting some very decent new visions of some old stories. \"Psycho\" is indeed the worst remake, in horror and in film, I have ever seen.",

So did Mozart when he recast Handel's Messiah and Acis & Galetea.  As did Brahms in his \"remake\": Variations on a Theme of Haydn.  Or Benjamin Britten's A Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (which \"borrowed\" it's theme from Henry Purcell).  Even Alfred Hitchcock's remake of \"The Man Who Know Too Much\" was much better than the original -- directed 25-30 years earlier by Alfred Hitchcock!  I'm just saying: lay off the hate.  It's no insult to have a new approach to a classic...and it's a tribute to the quality of the original when a major artist (like Van Sant) remakes/revises a cinematic masterpiece.",

            "content": "Gus Van Sant's \"remake\" of the classic 1960 film is nothing short of a slap in the face of the masterful original. Of all the dumb ideas Hollywood has given us, this shot-for-shot remake has to be one of the dumbest ideas in the history of cinema.\n\nThe plot is virtually the same: a woman named Marion Crane during a mid-life crisis of sorts ends up stealing $400,000 from a client at her real estate job (Instead of $40,000 like the original. Clever, ain't it?) and going on the run. During her run from the law, she stops by the lonely Bates Motel and meets the troubled, but fascinating Norman Bates and learns about his life and his ill mother. \n\nAs with the original, she is murdered in the shower and Norman Bates covers up the crime. So, when Marion remains missing, her sister, her boyfriend, and a private investigator search for her, only to uncover the horrifying secrets Norman Bates and his house of horrors hide.\n\nI have no fucking idea why anyone thought that a shot-for-shot remake was a good idea, because this film proves that such an idea almost never works outside of rare cases of foreign horror films being Americanized. However, Gus Van Sant instead opted to literally recreate the original film right down to how shots are framed, the same lines of the original with little to no changes, the same twists, the same everything - only this time in a bland color palette instead of the striking black and white imagery that was one of many aspects that made the original such an evocative and frightening film.\n\nEven though every scene is recreated and the actors say and do the same things the actors of the original did, the film fails to capture any of the magic, any of the terror, any of the little nuances (Example: in the original, you see a shot of Marion Crane wearing white lingerie and then after she steals the money, it changes to black lingerie as a representation of her good and bad behaviors. Here, her lingerie is colorful, losing the magic and feel), any of the subtleties, and any of the mystery. The whole thing feels like something you would get from a high school drama club if you got them to do a shot-for-shot remake of Psycho. It's also really maddening they chose this option considering all the groundwork laid out by the underrated sequels (Which are way better than what most moviegoers give them credit for) and all the untapped potential for a modernization of the iconic classic and really delving into the Norman Bates character.\n\nMost of the cast is pretty solid, but casting Vince Vaughn in the Norman Bates role was a misfire. I'm not expecting him to live up to the legendary performance of Anthony Perkins, but this is a massive miscalculation. Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates while terrifying and sadistic, was also sympathetic because of his mental issues and also exuded a natural innocence of sorts from his performance that didn't make you suspect who he really was. He was stunning to watch and seemed very believable. That's why his Norman Bates character is a far scarier killer than Michael Myers of Jason Voorhees ever could be. \n\nVince Vaughn's Norman Bates is just a crazy psycho killer without any of the charm nor is he anywhere near as believable as Anthony Perkins. I think he did try really hard, but what can you do when you're told to rehearse the same lines and do the same scenes and expect to produce the same magic?\n\nAnne Heche in the Marion Crane role was also a major miscalculation. Much like the case with Vaughn's performance being compared with Perkins', Heche cannot even touch the pedestal laid out by Janet Leigh. Leigh's Marion Crane, was also sympathetic despite her crime and seemed like a truly desperate woman who made a terrible decision out of haste with all the problems in her life.\n\nHeche's Marion Crane isn't particularly likable or sympathetic. In fact, I'd say her performance felt dead and distant. Vaughn may catch a lot of flack, but at least he tried with his performance. Heche's performance is awful and I didn't care what happened to her character unlike the original Marion Crane.\n\nThe other actors try their hardest with the bland recitations of the lines. I actually did enjoy the performances by Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore who shockingly managed to give decent performances despite the dead and hollow feel of the whole film.\n\nBut, in the end, this remake is nothing short of travesty. The only thing it ever truly does is make Psycho in color, and only making minor changes and adding more blood and nudity in the process. The damn film doesn't even look good in color! The colors all look bland and look even worse with poor lighting, just to add insult to injury. All it serves is to prove that you can't make magic happen twice. Avoid this remake and just stick with the previous Psycho films.",

No one is more aware of this, however, than director Gus Van Sant, who laughingly spits in the face of the studio system by literally creating a shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock's original shooting script. The initial results are quite amazing, and replicated to an impressive degree. Even more so than Hitchkock, Van Sant attempts to show that actors are nothing more than pawns under his control, but in the process, he proves there is much more that goes in to the success of a film than simple framing and editing. Van Sant's experiment in terror inevitably fails, no matter how close he comes to replicated the physical structure of the original. His is a soulless film, played out by an otherwise talented cast who are unable to bring the essence of life to their characters. By working off of Joe Stefano's original script and under the constraints of a duplication process, the delivery of the now dated dialog becomes forced and unnatural. We see actors acting, rather than characters interacting. Or, in Vince Vaugh's case, we see actors failing. Vaugh is a poor substitute for Anthony Perkins, and is simply unbecoming in the role. The novelty of Van Sant's cinematic prank wares off soon after Norman Bates is introduced, and without any new surprises left to look forward to, the remainder of the film becomes disastrously boring. In the end, the PSYCHO remake is nothing more than an intriguing concept and an experiment gone wrong that further solidifies Alfred Hitchcock's position as the Master of Horror.",

I'm not a big Vince Vaughn fan, but to his credit, he is actually trying here and seems to want to put his own spin on the Norman character (he's also easily the best thing about this film, surprisingly. He plays Norman as a man with a mental disability and doesn't appear to try and hide the fact that Norman is the killer.). Vaughn's Norman is much more creepy, and is a downright pervert. The main fault with the film's portrayal of Norman isn't even due to any of Vaughn's decisions, that being a masturbation scene with Norman (in which you can audibly hear the sound of him furiously fapping away while he watches Marion through a peep hole, I'm pretty sure this scene and that sound will forever haunt me till my dying day) that Van Sant decided to throw in. This sucks out all the reason you previously had to like Norman and just makes him a gross character. That said, I do like Vaughn as Norman....even though he brushes over some crucial lines and fails to reach the dizzying heights that Perkins was previously able to (no surprise there). The film does take place in 1998 (for whatever strange reason), and it rapes the setting of the Psycho House and the Bates Motel, updating each for the modern day, thus we get a Bates Motel that has a huge neon MOTEL sign on top of it and a completely different Psycho House. The film also has some annoying voice echoes (purely for stylistic reasons, although the choice just doesn't mesh well with the film), and the killing scenes are intercut with random shots of storms and the like, yet another choice that only distracts from the scene at hand and comes across as extremely messy. I do like the choice to film in color this time, and I like getting to see the red of the blood which kind of pops and makes that shower and  Norman's clean up more visual. While this attempted shot-for-shot and line for line (in reality some lines are added, some are done away with, and there are a few different shots) remake is pretty dull, I guess it's ok to see if you're morbidly curious.",

Macey to name a few) really elevate the proceedings. And, if anything, the film is an excuse to marvel at Vince Vaughn's incredibly engrossing portrayal of motel owner and operator Norman Bates, whose boyish charm, cheeky smile, and adorable laugh, mask sinister secrets. \n\nAs critic Gavin Smith (of the publication 'Sight and Sound') so eloquently put it: This remake is \"enough to justify the experiment: same film, different meaning. Where Hitchcock's Norman is conclusively Other, Van Sant's is one of us.\" \n\nA curiosity piece that's worth watching.",

Maybe not, but their acting is at least good enough to carry the film. Vince Vaughn was horrible miscast as Norman Bates. Seriously, who thought THAT was good casting? Anne Heche and Viggo Mortensen's \"new\" interpretations of their characters were just weird and didn't fit in the film (you almost WANT to see Heche murdered just so you can have enough of her pixified, strange, \"free-spirited\", and almost butchy, Marion Crane).

Her boss took his client into his office because \"it was air conditioning.\" I imagine that the majority of Arizona businesses have air conditioning. The other was the meeting of Lila Crane (Julianne Moore) & Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). Lila sporting the Walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie.

And in 1998, a film director by the name of Gus Van Sant, decided it would be a great idea to make a shot for shot remake. So not only did he say forget making a film with my own style as a filmmaker, I'll just try to steal someone else's style... Kind of... He completely misses the point as far as style goes, this film was meant to be shot in black and white. NOT COLOR!\r\n\r\nThe Story: Young man likes young women, young mans mother doesn't like young women, young mans mother kills young women the young man likes or is attracted to...\r\n\r\nThe Cast: Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche... This film is identical to the original in almost every way...The biggest difference between Van Sant and Hitchcock here is the fact that Hitchcock new how to cast a film. Vince Vaughn is a fine actor in other films, and is perfectly capable of doing a good job, anyone who has seen Swingers knows he's a good actor. But this is not an example of his fine acting skills. Not once did I believe that he was Norman Bates. Maybe it's just me, but his performance was lackluster in almost every way. There's just no topping Anthony Perkins of the original. Anne Heche also gave an underwhelming performance. Once again just not believable. A stale performance can hurt a lot in a film that's all about performance...Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh played roles that you'll remember because they brought the characters to life. Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche played mere imitations of those better actors.\r\n\r\nOne to Five Scale: 2\r\n\r\nIt's tough to not say 3 at least, but the acting and poor casting decisions hurt a lot. Theoretically, this should get the same score as the original because it's essentially the same thing. Seriously this is almost an exact replica of the original! There's only a few subtle differences but it's still pretty damned exact. But just because it's the same don't be fooled into thinking it's anywhere near as good. Because it's not. If you're going to watch Psycho go and seek out the original, it's by far much more rewarding.\r\n\r\nTyler\r\n\r\n7/19/2005",

Its many twists, shocking subject matter and revolutionary cinematography completely reinvented the genre. It does seem a bit ironic that Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake is the complete opposite. There's nothing shocking or revolutionary about it. In fact, it's essentially a carbon copy of the original, only in color. It's competently acted and shot, and rarely dull, but it just doesn't have any justification for its existence. \r\n\r\nVince Vaughn is miscast as iconic villain Norman Bates, originally portrayed by Anthony Perkins. Vaughn's acting is passable, but still pales in comparison to Perkins' original devious portrayal. It's also difficult to take such a well-known comedian seriously as a serial killer. Anne Heche's performance as Marion Crane is respectable but, again, I can't help but compare her to the brilliant portrayal by Janet Leigh. The rest of the cast is rounded off by the Boogie Nights/Magnolia gang Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and Philip Baker Hall. I'm just surprised John C. Reilly and Phillip Seymour Hoffman weren't in this. As expected from three great actors, Moore, Macy and Baker Hall do fine jobs, but their performances in Psycho would not rank among their best work.\r\n\r\nPsycho contains many positive qualities, but almost none of them can be accredited to Gus Van Sant or any of the crew behind the film. Most of the film's strengths - whether it be the music, the story, or the dialogue - can be accredited to Alfred Hitchcock, Bernard Herrmann, and the crew behind the original. The story is full of mystery and intrigue, the score is exhilarating, and the dialogue is sharp - albeit a tad old-fashioned for today's standards. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but it often doesn't result in quality film-making.",

            "content": "The 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's landmark thriller, Psycho is among the oddest remakes ever made. It garnered a competent director in Good Will Hunting helmsman Gus Van Sant, it used the original and brilliant screenplay (with a few modernized touches) by Joseph Stefano, and it assembled a talented (if miscast) ensemble. And in the end, it still sucked beyond anyone's wildest imagination. Less a remake and more of a modern repackaging of the original, Psycho is the kind of remake that, instead of a homage and reverent nod to a film classic, leads to old Hitchcock spinning in his grave. Van Sant had undoubtedly good intentions going into this project, as he attempts something never seen before in the world of big-budget Hollywood: a shot-for-shot remake. Indeed, Van Sant uses most (if not all) of Hitchcock's original camera angles, musical cues (Bernard Hermann's original score is lovingly preserved and rearranged by Danny Elfman), and shadowy cinematography. However, in this regard, he made three fatal mistakes: One, shooting in color, Two, multiple miscast roles, and Three, not diverting enough from the original, and in the only place where he does, for cheap exploitative effect. The lame color tone of Van Sant's Psycho basically exemplifies why Hitchcock chose to shoot in black-and-white in the first place, as it's a murky and visually ugly film that makes you wonder where all of its $60 million budget went to. Then there are the totally wrong and baffling casting decisions, starting, of course, with Vince Vaughn. Casting Vaughn to fill the shoes of the late Anthony Perkins was probably the worst casting move in the last 15 years, as simply put, he doesn't have the insane chops to pull of Norman Bates. He lacks the lanky, nervous, giggly, and bubbling madness that defined Perkins' original performance, and simply comes off as slightly weird or even mentally challenged. Vaughn simply, as Roger Ebert put it, \"isn't odd enough\". Bad casting move #2 was Anne Heche as Marion Crane. Whereas Janet Leigh's original was more confident and assured, Heche plays Marion as mousy and weak-willed, and just comes off as an entirely different character despite speaking the exact same lines. Julianne Moore as Marion's sister Lila, is more forgivable, and William H. Macy gets the job done as Milton Arbogast, but Viggo Mortensen too, is miscast, playing John Gavin's original part with a needless oddity. The only places where Psycho differs from the original is in the murder scenes (a stupid new dream sequence-like thing takes away all suspense), and in Norman's peeping, where we now get a gross and overly gratuitous scene of Norman pleasuring himself. Psycho 1998 simply didn't need to be made. Hitchcock and Perkins deserved better.",

If you've seen the original, then you don't need to see this one, as this one is very predictable, and not fun to watch whatsoever. This film is an insult to the original, and proves that certain remakes definitely have no clue in creating a new angle on a story that has already been told. This is a poorly made film, and Gus Van Sant is pretty hit and miss as a director, Elephant and Milk were great films, but this is his worst picture. Horror fans will definitely not enjoy how pointless this film is. The acting is bad, the directing is sloppy and there's nothing to warrant a viewing this is bad and I absolutely hated this film, and I think this is one of the worst remakes that has ever been made. Definitely avoid this film, and watch the classic Psycho instead. At least that one had great directing, an effective plot and wonderful directing by a master of cinema. This one simply doesn't deliver. I view this film as a slap in the face of the original, and it's not a film that should be seen, only avoided.

From just seeing a few scenes of the 1998 PSYCHO remake, it is clear that this one is an exact, shot-for-shot remake of Alfred Hitchcock's thrilling classic.  This, though new and in color, is not a classic.  It is as if the filmmakers decided to take the original 1960 screenplay and use that without changing it at all--but wouldn't it make more sense to write another, different screenplay off the book this is based on?  I guess they all overlooked that.  So if the 1998 version of PSYCHO looks appealing to you, go ahead, but I advise you, it's basically the 1960 version, minus the good acting, minus the thrills, plus the color aspect.

The room rates have gone up, and it's impish Anne Heche now checking in. Still, if it looks, sounds and feels like Psycho, then it is Psycho, isn't it?\n\nSince it was announced that Gus Van Sant was to redo Hitchcock's 1960 classic, the film fanatics' outcry was immediate, critical knives were hastily sharpened and industry buzz yo-yoed from \"absolutely dire\" to \"a magnificent coup\". Van Sant, purists claimed, must be psycho himself to want to hack up this masterpiece, the only horror film Hitchcock made and arguably his most famous work. But as Van Sant retorted, he has gone for \"replica\" more than \"remake\". Quite why is another matter, but this rumored obsession with replication - same script, same angles, same six week shooting schedule - has made Psycho '98 an intriguing proposition.\n\nYou probably know the set-up; insurance worker Marion Crane (Heche) goes on the lam with a bootload of loot, checks into a sleazy motel, gets stabbed - and a pursuing pack tries to fathom out the connection between the crime, motelier Norman Bates (here played by Vaughn) and his mysterious mother. But there are plenty who won't have seen it, which is why revamping a film decades later is no less sacrilegious than Hitchcock himself having a stab at it, redoing his own The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) in 1956.\n\nThat Hitchcock was deemed the only man worthy of remaking Hitchcock, though, is telling. Much imitated and with other rehashes - such as the recent A Perfect Murder - a failing dismally, few have come close to replicating the Master's extraordinary ability to wring tension and black humor. But Van Sant, to his credit, pulls off the visuals, not exactly a shot-for-shot retread (there is extra information thrown in about Bates' domestic life, for example) but as near as dammit - he even throws in a nifty sight gag by replaying the original director's crossing-the-road cameo using a Hitchcock double.\n\nBut how Van Sant was underestimated Hitchcock's savvy casting. The original Psycho got away with the revolutionary concept of having its heroine exit in the first half because the aftermath became a compelling game of intrigue, sustained by the brilliant Anthony Perkins. Psycho '98, by comparison, seems all downhill from its early bathroom crescendo. The sorry shower of entrails into the drama - the sister (Julianne Moore), the boyfriend (Viggo Mortensen) and, a bit more chipper, the gumshoe (William H. Macy) - seem insufficiently threatened by New Model Norman. It's not that Vince Vaughn doesn't pull off Perkins' creepy fidgets and stammers, he just seems too wholesome and beer boy to convince as a nerd still tied to Mother's apron strings.\n\nPerhaps one addition in Psycho '98 - Vaughn masturbating while spying on Heche - says more about this update than anything else. The thrill of the original is seeing a black-and-white, one-foot-on-the-floor, no-sex-please Hays Code world suddenly explode into a slasher movie. Our loss of innocence has, simply, changed all the rules.",

The same can go with Anne Heche, did a good job acting, but it just doesn't work for me. Another thing is the tone of the film, it's just not right. It's way too bright and cheery in it's color scheme and lighting in a way that it starts to feel animatic. Some things are mean't to be left alone and this is certainly one of them.

That's really not very credible, because this Psycho remake is so obviously a work of admiration, even obsession, and all the performers and crafters have done such a respectable job, it's clear this is just an expensive homage to a beloved seminal film.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, so many reviewers seem to bend over backwards in reactionary defense of Hitchcock's film, as if it needed defending, and seem to lose sight of the finer points of this one. It is, after all, laid out extremely faithfully to the original in frames and pacing. The color photography is wonderful, the subtle revaluations of certain scenes interesting, and the cast works very well, although the absence of any force as oddly fascinating and well-modulated as Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates is a serious shortcoming.\r\n\r\nBut, although I've enjoyed this Psycho, as watchable as it is, it really does seem impossible to escape the very obvious feeling that we've seen this before, and better and creepier and more gripping. Watching the same movie over again, but reborn as a dramatically flatter, dumber clone, rings bells that proclaim convincingly the pointlessness of its artistic existence.\r\n\r\nHowever, this virtually catastrophic predicament aside, Psycho (1998) is still worthwhile as a speculative venture and test of the limits of the artistic tribute. It's entertaining, just not anywhere near as sharp as the original, but no better or no worse than the general rubbish that habitually tops any given years' most-popular films list.",

Take a shower.\"\n\nNot only is it argued that this Psycho is just a pointless remake of a brilliant classic; it is fact. There's no real reason for a shot by shot remake of Hitchcock's brilliant and influential piece of horror/psychological thriller history. As it is though, I still have a hard time hating it. It's well made, updated, and the theme of sexuality is more at the forefront, or at least more obvious. This is a movie that I neither like or dislike. It merely exists.\n\nNorman runs the Bates Motel, and when Marion Crane, a woman who has just run from Phoenix with $400,000, stops by, things get interesting. There's no point in really talking about the plot any further than that because if you've seen the original, it's the exact same and if you haven't, I wouldn't want to ruin it for you, but definitely check out the original because it is one of the best movies ever made period.\n\nI have a lot of respect for Gus Van Sant and the way he goes about making movies. He never expected this to be a well received movie, but it was a project that he personally wanted to do. You have to appreciate a filmmaker who is making films for himself and not a mass audience, and that is Gus Van Sant. So while I don't see a real reason for making this, I don't hate that he did. I don't believe he disrespected the original and if anything, it should serve as more of a tribute than anything. \n\nHate it or tolerate it, Gus Van Sant's Psycho exists. The cast is pretty good, besides the fact that I didn't love Vince Vaughn as Norman. The Rest of the cast is pretty much perfect though, especially William H. Macy as the private detective. So I'm not going to recommend this, but if you are a big fan of the original and of Van Sant, it's not as worthless a movie as everyone would have you believe.",

            "content": "Well...it took about 12 years for me to discover this film. When it was originally released - I too thought it was pure blasphemy. Remake Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO? Now THAT'S psycho!?! I really had no desire to see it...nor have I really read any reviews. All I know is that is was pretty much panned by critics and viewers - and probably deservedly so. \r\n\r\n...but I happened to be surfing the cable channels one recent evening when I caught sight of the start of director Gus Van Sant's *ahem* remake *shudder* of Hitchcock's PSYCHO...and to my utter surprise - i was instantly hooked...and slowly realized what Van Sant had done. \r\n\r\nIf you are an artist...or would-be artist...then you probably had the desire to copy or emulate a drawing or painting from an artist that you much admired. Kids do this when they try to copy panels from their favorite comic books. Some of the French Impressionists were influenced by japanese art and copied (errr...studied) japanese drawings and composition. How many would-be abstract painters had a hand in making a spatter painting a la Jackson Pollack? Sure...not all artists (or filmmakers) have the wherewithal or resources ($25 million budget in this case) to try to copy an iconic film...but here it is. \r\n\r\nWhen you think \"remake\" - you figure the director had an idea to improve, or maybe possibly expand on the themes of the original film. I also thought Van Sant would ramp up the violence (of the granddad of all slashers) to modern standards...and to my surprise - Van Sant does no such thing! Sure...Van Sant uses color film stock and sets the tale in contemporary times but the overall spirit of the film is exactly in keeping with Hitchcock's original...so much so, that I view his version of PSYCHO as a true homage to the master... rather than just a simple remake. I have yet to hear the commentary on the DVD (I would love to) but I'm thinking it must have been a ball and a challenge to have worked on a project like this. Because of their exact scene-by-scene recreation of PSYCHO - I can just feel director Van Sant's and cinematographer Christopher Doyle's admiration for the original...and that I, vicariously...was enjoying and applauding  their attempt at recreation...and thereby giving you a much deeper appreciation for the original! \r\n\r\nScenes you once may have taken for granted - in my case, like the shot of Norman Bates craning his neck to view Marion Crane's signature in his check-in book (as pointed out to him by Arbogast) until the camera is virtually looking up Bate's nostrils. It's a bit of a disconcerting shot (especially at such an odd angle) but adds to the overall lunacy of the film.\r\n\r\nI love the opening shot as the camera tracks over Phoenix and enters the window of a building and we see Marion Crane and Sam lying in bed...as if Hitchcock makes voyeurs out of his audience. I noticed the same shot during the opening of his THE LADY VANISHES (as the camera tracks over a miniature alpine village...and enters the scene through the window of an inn)...even the master copies himself! Thanks to modern technology, Van Sant achieves the same shot in one take -uninterrupted by edits.\r\n\r\nIt's also interesting watching the 2 films simultaneously. In the scene when Marion is awakened at the side of the road by a highway patrolman - Van Sant managed to find the exact same location as in the original. The scene is meticulously recreated - right down to including the same license plate numbers on both Marion's and the patrolman's cars...!!!\r\n\r\nVan Sant's choice of casting Anne Heche as Marion Crane seems odd...since Heche doesn't remind me of Janet Leigh at all. WIth her short hair, large almond eyes, and slim figure - Heche seems a bit pixie-ish (a description I would not attribute to Leigh) - but overall she does a fine job...as does the rest of the cast. Vince Vaugh is the creepy Norman Bates and William H. Macy as the detective Arbogast. \r\n\r\nFabulous too is hearing Bernard Hermann's score redone in stereo by Danny Elfman.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend viewing this over the original...but if you are a fan of the original -then viewing this might be a curiosity. \r\n\r\nWhen the scene that contains Hitchcock's cameo appears - Hitchcock is seen scolding director Van Sant - a very nice humorous touch...but the end of the film has this dedication: IN MEMORY OF ALFRED HITCHCOCK. \r\nThat says it all right there!!!  \r\n\r\n8.5",

The plot is widely known so i won't go into too much detail, but it's just simply about a women who steals 40, 000$ (400,000 in this version) and stumbles up the Bates Motel, where she meets a creepy but innocent man named Norman who lives with his crazy mother. Now, I know this movie might not seem so bad when one thinks \"hey its just a duplicate of Hitchcock's film except modernized so it must still be good. WRONG. Problem #1: this film is in COLOR! Hitchcock specifically made his film in black and white to give it an eerie feeling and so it wouldn't seem as gory.  Well i swear, if you just remove the shitty re-arrangement of Bernard Herrman's chilling score (which had more impact in the original) then i would swear this is just some cheap unfunny comedy. One scene that made me mad: in the original I always liked the symbolism before Marion packs up and takes the money off her bed, shes in the first scene shown in white then in this scene she is shown in black; to show how she lost her innocence. It's a great scene and you can feel for Marion and the tough decision she had to make. In the remake: Marion is wearing a bright ugly orange sundress that looks like it came off my grandma's rocking chair and her room is green and red. It lost all the impact right there by not making it dark, even though the character IS committing a crime and struggling with a tough decision right here. And the shower scene, the blood in this film looks faker than the chocolate syrup used in Hitchcock's version!.. but i digress.\n\nAnother HUGE problem: the casting. This cast is SOOO awful I don't even know where to begin. First, let's start off with the character i hated the most in this remake, the Marion character who is played some girl who looks like a lesbian elf version of the mom from Suite Life of Zack and Cody. She is very unconvincing, you can tell when she is reading off her cue cards and trying hard to duplicate the original character played by Janet Leigh, who you could tell when she was scared or nervous. This new woman is just awful, i was actually excited when she got killed instead of feeling sorry for her.\n\nBut the major problem with the casting is.. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates!!! Who the hell thought of this idea? What's next is Adam Sandler going to play Dracula? I mean, Vaughn tries so hard to be creepy its hilarious. But while trying too hard to be creepy, he also loses the likable charm that Anthony Perkins had. I'll tell you, Vince Vaugn for me was like the LEAST creepiest character in this film. I was more afraid of the awful acting of Marion and her boyfriend (who sounds like some Iraq hillbilly veteran in this version) than i was of Vince Vaughn. He is just not creepy as much and doesn't play it convincing enough to show you he's just a momma's boy and not a psychopathic killer.\n\nI think probably the thing that will stick out the most from this version is: the AWFUL masturbation scene! In this version, when Norman peeks through the hole to see Marion undress, instead of just peeking and walking away (which was more creepier), you hear wet noises and you see Vince Vaughn with his pants down motioning that he's masturbating. WHY put that in here? It doesn't add impact to the character it's just disgusting and was completely unnecessary. Another thing that pissed me off was the shower scene: in this film when the curtains pull open, the new Marion gives the shittiest reaction ive ever seen. Its almost as if she was like \"huh? is this my cue to act scared now? okay\". The \"mother\" in this film looks the girl from the grudge if she died her hair blonde. I mean, its supposed to look like \"mother\" is killing the girl not some dirty zombie. And this new shower scene is just pure disgusting: you see cuts all over the girl's body while shes squirming around like a dumbass and they added sound effects that more realistically show a rusty knife going into a body. It's not just frightening anymore as it was in the original, just gory (which isnt scary, it's nasty and nobody wants to see it).\n\nSo as you call tell....... this remake of Psycho is trash! garbage! shit! Every word that was ever invented that means \"awful\" can be used here. It just proves that you can't remake a classic and that acting and cinematography DOES mean a lot to a film. The ending title for this film read, \"In Memory of Alfred Hitchcock\" which is a huge slap in the face.",

Even Vince Vaughan doesn't hurt what is essentialy a shot for shot remake too bad. Before all the pompous purists jump up and stab me to death whilst wearing their dead mums frock, I would like to say why. When Psycho was made in the 60's it was current to the time, using nice camera effects to give feelings of perspective and dread. It was mordern in every sense. The acting in the original Psycho was largly hammy and poor, Anthony Perkins can't act for fudge (Vince vaughan isn't much better) Were it not for Hitchcock excellent ideas the film would have sucked ass. If you review the original today and by how entertained you are watching it today, the film is good, but slow and is a three star thriller. respectable for an old movie but still a three star in my book. When I saw this remake years ago I hated it, I wondered WHY? But watching it again today, I understood, and was thoroughly entertained.  In all of the key scenes the action and technique IS better ... same, but better. Hitch would have loved to have had the opportunity to take advantage of modern film making technology, remember that. The acting IS better, though I wouldn't have cast Vince as 'Norman' but then I can't remember who the youthful options were in '98. The players are more fleshed out, with better dialogue. The movie is still slow-ish, but edited with slightly more pace. Qustionable validity when screened in '98, but this is a faithful upgrade to the original, and very enjoyable today.",

The 1998 remake of the classic Hitchcockian \"Psycho\" is not trying to make any bold statements throughout its run. Instead Van Sant decides to do a shot for shot remake of the film, using the same camera angles, cinematography, and only updating technology and references, yet not reinvisioning the characters. Still, none of the actors comes across as their original characters. Norman Bates was such a huge presence in the film, and he is the namesake of the film, so the other major characters came off as minor caricatures in Bates' little game of self-hatred and psychosis. Van Sant put in a lot of work trying to make his A-list stars recreate the tension and exhausting thrill of the original. Heche is so timid throughout, especially those shots of her headlong in the car which make her seem so small. Between her and Vaughan, the two of them seem like kids playing in their parents too big clothes. Vaughan also is wrong for this, but not because his performance was such a change from the original. Vaughan is wrong, wrong, wrong for this part in so many ways it boggles the mind. Besides not being able to pull off a serious role, he can't embody creepy. Perkins was creepy because of his slight, lean frame, his clawed fingers around that knife, buggered eyes, and though he was so quiet and calm throughout, the ending is only slightly a surprise, only lightly out of the realm of possibility. Moore is far too forceful, Macy stayed true to the original character but barely resonates, and Mortensen is clumsy as a let loose pig. The colors in this are post-modernist and glaring, as the blood dribbles onto white tiles, the Navajo sun over the desert stretch of highway, the deep red of the bathroom walls. It's disgustingly gluttonous and that's all because the original was in black and white Van Sant does do an impressive job of recreating the original sets, but it's just another instance of a complete copy. Some key scenes, including the disposal of the body, showing Marion slashed and torn apart by knife wounds, lost the insidious edge the film was at least trying to cultivate. Also, the fact that we never see Vaughan use the mother's voice, and it's off camera, was an obvious  ploy to keep the heavy baritone of Vaughan's voice from coming off as cheesy in a fake old woman's croon. It's trying too hard to be the original, and even as an experiment it is beyond exhausting.",

Tony Perkins played Norman Bates as a jumpy awkward nerd, but still as kind of a likable guy. Vaughn, on the other hand, comes off as a creepy weirdo right from the start. He just SEEMS like a guy that would dress up like a woman and hack people up. Realistically, any halfway intelligent woman meeting this guy would have ran out of there immediately. Later, when Norman Bates sinks the car with the body in the trunk and it stops sinking, it is important for the audience to root for it to go down. If you don't have any sympathy for Norman Bates, which you don't in this newer version, the scene doesn't work. It's really about the audience's shifting loyalties. \r\n\r\nSecond, \"Psycho\" just works better in black and white. It gives it an otherwordly vibe and I don't think the story works in color. It feels too realistic like the slasher flicks that \"Psycho\" influenced. So while aping a classic movie all the way down to the shot selection is probably a harebrained idea fundamentally, what stood out to me as wrong about this effort was where the movie DIDN'T copy the original.",
