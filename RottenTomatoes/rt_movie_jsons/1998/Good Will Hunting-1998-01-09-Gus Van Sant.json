    "summary": "Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a genius-level IQ but chooses to work as a janitor at MIT. When he solves a difficult graduate-level math problem, his talents are discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), who decides to help the misguided youth reach his potential. When Will is arrested for attacking a police officer, Professor Lambeau makes a deal to get leniency for him if he will get treatment from therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams).",

Even though it can jump around a bit with the editing from time to time telling Sean & Gerald's story as well once it settles on Will throughout it moves effortlessly. The music is very good as well. The drama is riveting, the dialogue is phenomenal, and the acting is amazing. Even though the story is at its core simple, its layered enough, told with love and care and fleshed out with compelling characters to make it something that everyone should see once.",

He was a foster child that went through many abusive foster families before living on his own. This has left many scars not only on his body but also in his heart. This prevents him from moving forward through life and fulfilling his potential. This would all change after one fateful encounter...\n\nI absolutely loved this movie. The characters are super intricate and intriguing. The pacing is very solid; there are always moving parts in play that keep your attention close to the story. Camerawork was nothing to write home about but not the worst either. The music in this movie was absolutely perfect, loved it very much. In general this movie is one of my favorites of all time. So with a little bias sprinkled on top I will give this movie a perfect score.\n\n10/10",

            "content": "\"Good Will Hunting\" (1997) is a drama/romance film that explores the life and struggles of Will Hunting (played by Matt Damon), a young man from a working-class background who has a prodigious talent for mathematics. Directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Damon and Ben Affleck, the film follows Will as he navigates his relationships with his friends, his love interest (played by Minnie Driver), and a therapist (played by Robin Williams) who helps him to confront his personal demons.\n\nThe film's strongest aspect is its writing, with Damon and Affleck delivering a powerful and emotional script that explores themes of identity, relationships, and personal growth. The film's characters are well-written and well-acted, with Damon delivering a standout performance as Will Hunting. Williams also delivers an excellent performance as Will's therapist, earning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nThe film's cinematography is solid and effective, capturing the gritty and realist aesthetic of the film's working-class setting. The film's music, composed by Danny Elfman, is subtle and effective, enhancing the film's emotional moments without overwhelming them. The film's direction by Van Sant is confident and assured, delivering a visual style that is both effective and understated.\n\nHowever, some may argue that the film's pace is slow at times, lacking the dramatic momentum of other dramas. Additionally, some may find the film's resolution to be too neat and tidy, failing to fully explore the complexities of Will's personal struggles.\n\nOverall, \"Good Will Hunting\" is a well-made and emotionally powerful drama/romance film that explores themes of identity, relationships, and personal growth with intelligence and empathy. With strong writing, excellent performances, and confident direction, \"Good Will Hunting\" is a movie that will appeal to fans of drama, romance, and thought-provoking filmmaking.",

The film stars Matt as Will Hunting, a young man from South Boston with a troubled past who works as a janitor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). \n\nDespite lacking former education, Will is able to solve a mathematics problem which was supposed to be very advanced for the actual students, revealing that the protagonist actually has an overwhelming talent for mathematics. When a renowned mathematician (played by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) discovers Will's abilities, he sets out to help him reach his full potential. The story goes on when, due to unforeseen circumstances, Will has to attend a psychologist called Sean (Robin Williams), and also finds the person who could be the love of his life.\n\nThis film enters typical topics such as love and friendship, but also enters in the world of denial and struggle to find one's place in the world. The performance by all the main actors (Damon, Affleck and Williams) are outstanding, and the film's script is moving and insightful. Even if Good Will Hunting is a movie over 20 years old, it still remains an emotional and impactful movie.",

If it truly followed through as a feel-good winner story that had us rooting for the main character then I would have enjoyed the ride however this film plays on uncomfortable moments to create tension which in my opinion stands in the way of making this enjoyable viewing. The whole relationship angle that our genius becomes involved in is an aside as is the strangled attempts to clean him up via therapy. We get a lot of impressions within the movie but nothing really sticks. As usual, Willams overshadows the entire cast but even then I feel he is acting alone in a movie that is indifferent to talent and simply tells the story of a clever guy who has been overlooked. And to be honest that is a story that does not really need to be told. What a bore.",

Coming from a similar background as Will on the opposite side of the country in a little corner of Los Angeles, I think I look at him and get scared because I see myself in him. Not at the same level of intelligence, but on a uniquely similar wavelength. Friends who don't come from much but would still take a bullet for me, a hard upbringing coupled with an extreme aversion to rules and attachment, would, I'd say make me a prime candidate for a conscious comparison. Wouldn't look at a guy like me and think much of anything besides \"I might take him back to my house for the night. MIGHT.\" Wouldn't think I tested college level for my writing ability in the third grade, or that I know more about stock options than I do shapes. But therein lays the beauty of the chord that this film plucks on time and time again. I can't watch this film without being on the verge of tears because Will Hunting is painfully real. All the kid ever wanted was to feel like he belonged. Like someone cared. And no one ever did until he met Skylar. That's where this film gets it right. Nothing will ever change a man's life more than the loving touch of a woman. I only wish I didn't push the Skylar I knew away. Because I know she's not coming back. He didn't have that burden.",

Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.\n\nGood Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.\n\nThe acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best \"drama\" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.\n\nAll in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The back and fourth between two characters and also the monolagues different characters had were moving, intriguing, and interesting. From symbolism to Foreshadowing the poetic tone that every word held brought a breath of fresh air into this movie. But what would be the point of good writing if there were no good actors? Wouldn't that just make the screen play become a cheesy mess? Well everyone in this stellar cast made it very clear through their performances that they really cared about the characters.

He has a poor background and emotional problems from a bad childhood, plus a girl interested in him, yet instead of breaking out of his miserable existence he initially wants to stay in it...but is convinced to change his mind.\n\nSo what went wrong? A genius might have a rough existence, but he acts like everybody else around him except for his magically solving complicated mathematical problems. Um, anyone who's so much smarter than his peers would show signs of it that nobody could ignore, such as being able to say and do things most others wouldn't think of. Why couldn't he have become, say, a professional gambler (degree not required)? Why would he cause trouble and not be able to charm his way out of it.

About a man sitting on a goldmine but he's to scared to reach out and cash it in. The back and forth between Will and Sean, the confrontations with Skyler and Lambeau, the casual heart to heart of two buddies taking a break at work. The satisfying moments of Will's intellectual triumph's revealed to mean nothing to him, boring to him. All of this real, human drama asks the question of what potential is, what purpose is. Unlike so many films that use ambiguity as a pedestal for creating more evocative work, Good Will Hunting gives a quiet, thoughtful answer to the question it asks and says if you want to reach your potential you have to get off your butt and do something, get out of your comfort zone. Will's intellectual capabilities were only part of the picture and from a storytelling perspective, just a larger than life ingredient to drive home the message of the question \"what do you want to do?\" I think when Sean asks that question is when Will's world suddenly falls. Suddenly it's not about living up to other peoples expectations, it's about living up to your own, about having the drive to do something more. With Skyler to get him thinking, Sean to get him talking and the last push from Chuckie to get him moving, Will is faced with his whole life and finally knows what he'll do with it. That's a powerful message and one made ever so poignant by the eloquence of the dialogue (punctuated... ahem, ever so delicately by the... ahem, colorful language) that often plays out like a battle of wits that's a pleasure to witness, the strength, the depth of emotion, the genuine feeling of each performance (especially from the great Robin Williams), the slices of goofing around, telling stories, talking about nothing gives out a feel good spirit to a movie with a message that should be hard to swallow. Not only is that good stuff, that's important stuff, especially for me, That's almost definitely the reason I'm giving this movie such a high rating. The core of it connected with me in a very special way but it's not bias, it's just what art does to you.",

Robin Williams is amazing and Matt Damon is quite impressive with his emotional range considering how early he was in his career at this point. I love the themes about life, personal relationships, careers, and the deep personal impacts of childhood trauma. My only glaring issue with the movie is how cruel and borderline abusive Matt Damon's character gets towards his girlfriend towards the end of the movie and just how nonchalantly glossed over it was by the movie and the other characters. They treated it more like a disappointing break-up than a yellow flag of the possibility of continuing the cycle of abuse onto his loved ones. Which is a damn shame since it could've been a really powerful moment that would've shed some nuance on the dangers of lashing out at your loved ones as a means of coping with your own trauma and how we can choose the higher path. It could've done a better job at highlighting the consequences of lashing out and the path to personal redemption. I'll also admit that the protagonist is a bit grating early on as the unrealistically brilliant and douchey jerk-sue character, a common power fantasy enjoyed by male screenwriters and moviegoers alike. But flaws aside, this is still an emotionally moving movie that's definitely worth a watch.",

The story itself had an obvious destination, but the same can be said of most movies, and it's less plot-driven than most so it's hardly a criticism. The characters were well-designed and the scenes with his therapist were effective at eliciting emotion. I wasn't fully on board with the initial fighting scenes as the fact they were written by testosterone-filled 20-somethings shone through in them but they otherwise did an impeccable job. The acting was obviously top-notch and the really seemed to make their $10M budget stretch with well-designed sets.",

The soul of this movie is undoubtedly Robin Williams and his powerful ability to portrait genuine compassion woven with pain and hurt. Matt Damon is also no slouch in that department. That sentiment and barriers we all face accessing that virtue is the core of this movie. The narrative is pretty standard: someone greater than their class and start held back by the legacy of that life trying to find a way out. All the usual stages of psychological development play out: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and eventual acceptance of life's trauma. The formula isn't this story's big hook. It is how the characters manage to feel so real. \n\nEveryone in this movie shows moments of honesty, failure and humanity. They all do it in ways that remain true to the characters they're cast as. This is not all moments of feel good triumph or acceptance, but people growing struggling and advancing with the materials put in front of them. I cannot think of a more satisfying way to tell this type of story. \n\nGood Will Hunting is an excellent movie that falls short of the upper crust because it was maybe not daring enough. When you re-watch the movie, at least for me, I am struck how I stopped focusing on the narrative at all and really focused on the scenes, the bottled moments and witty dialogue. That is the magic in this movie and for that, it is a real masterwork",

My one question is, HOW DID THIS NOT GET THE COMEDY GENRE TITLE?! I found this movie absolutely hilarious through the first two acts! The jokes hit every single time, due to the terrific chemistry the whole cast has. With the absolute brilliant script, Matt Damon & Ben Affleck were awarded by the Academy Awards for Best Original Script.\n\nBilly Hopkins, Kerry Barden & Suzanne Smith casted such a brilliantly talented cast, that had effortless chemistry. Matt Damon put on, in my opinion, his best performance, and I'm still very upset he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor. His performance was super intelligent, while also having so many different enjoyable character traits. Right off the bat, you really felt for his character. His backstory is what holds him back in life, playing himself as his own antagonist, so it was a breeze to indulge into his character, despite his unorthodox personality. Ben Affleck put on such an authentic performance. The connection Affleck & Damon have off the screen really shows on set, being cut from the same cloth, along with Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser & John Mighton. Right along with Matt Damon, I'd personally say that this is my favorite Robin Williams performance. You can sense his wit & mature mindset the minute he steps foot on set. The bond he creates with Matt Damon is nothing short of inspiring, while having one of the best scenes in cinema history. His performance felt so genuine & connective, it won him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Minnie Driver was a constant presence throughout the film, aiding Damon's character development. She was also another character you can truly feel for. Her expressions and feelings were sold great, feeling like Damon & Driver have done more than one movie together. Stellan Skarsgard was a big part of how everything moved. He also had a great connection with Robin Williams, having one specific scene feeling so real! The Boston accents everyone had were actually awesome! Everyone who had the accent, felt so authentic, flowing great with the theme and setting.\n\nOverall, after only seeing this movie once, it ranks up in my personal favorite top ten list.",

This movie is about a genius young man, that struggles to find his place in the world. Really funny, fantasticly acted, very good script with some of the best dialogue I've seen. There's a thing about this movie that keeps it from being perfect for me. There's a scene with Casey Affleck that totally breaks the tone of the move, I'm not gonna say which one it is though. That scene is very unnecessary for me and shouldn't have made the cut. Other than that it's a great movie. Good Will Hunting will surely please audiences looking for a good heartfelt movie, and a brilliant performance from the late great Robin Williams.",

Oh that's right, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were in their twenties when they wrote the script. They are not screenwriters, they were just kids. Only kids will write such a movie with little to no substance and fill it with profanity and sexuality for no reason. What else the kids in their twenties know? The main shock is that how they got the Late Robin Williams to play a part in this. My two stars are for the scenes between Matt Damon and Robin Williams. That's enough of my ranting.

            "content": "A thoughtful film about empathy.\n\nGus Van Zant's indie coming of age drama Good Will Hunting (1997) is phenomenal. It's still as affecting now that I'm grown up as when I was an impressionable kid watching this film. Gus van Zant's direction is intimate and heartfelt as he casually captures genuine moments of friendship, romance, and therapy with a gentle eye for serene mid shots. His use of close-ups is particularly riveting and emotional in Good Will Hunting. Van Zant's indie sensibilities ensure his artistic vision is realized in a sincere way full of fragile sentimental characters that reflect regular guys. You can tell Van Zant is an indie auteur as he even has underground director Harmony Korine cameo as a crazy criminal named Jerve.\n\nMatt Damon is astounding as the complex teenage savant Will Hunting. He explodes with visceral rage, defensive angst, endearing romance, cruel lies, endless deceit, broken tears, and peerless academic knowledge. Damon convinces you his character Will is both troubled and genius. He feels effortless in the role, but you can tell Damon poured his heart and soul into this magnificent character acting. I would even say Will Hunting is his best character up there with Jason Bourne. Damon is not always a subtle actor, but his expressive acting is full of energy and passion.\n\nRobin Williams is sublime as Sean Maguire. His bearded, patient, and sensitive therapist professor is such a wonderful display of Williams' dramatic prowess as an actor. He demonstrates how deep he can make a man with his nuanced and devastating dramatic character acting. Williams uses his immense heart to make Maguire inspiring, relatable, and real. He delivers several incredible speeches and lines that stay with you forever after seeing Good Will Hunting.\n\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd is excellent as the driven, genius mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau pushing Damon towards a theoretical mathematics profession. Ben Affleck makes a turn as a nice loyal friend to Damon named Chuckie Sullivan. His earnest admission about his desire for Will's future at the construction site is so powerful and real, especially with the payoff at Will's house at the end. Good Will Hunting is some of Ben Affleck's finest dramatic acting. Casey Affleck is hilarious as the Boston lowlife Morgan O'Mally. His casual remarks come across as really sincere, so he's an endearing idiot. I love his one liner after Damon stands up for Ben Affleck against a pseudo-intellectual college student. Minnie Driver is profoundly moving as Damon's girlfriend Skylar. Her tears in her dorm room feel so authentic to her character's heartbreak.\n\nGood Will Hunting is simply a life changing, life affirming, and inspiring film that holds up beautifully. Van Zant desperately searches for human decency and kindness in his seminal drama. You will find purpose in life after watching this moving drama that is so very down to Earth. Good Will Hunting is one of those rare films that everyone I know loves dearly.\n\nMatt Damon and Ben Affleck's script is raw, real, and thoughtful as these two teenage actors wrote an original screenplay with a Boston realism and a sympathetic viewpoint. They take on child abuse, career potential, lifelong friendship, new romance, spousal grief, patient therapy, and emotional honesty in this mature script full of heart. How can you not be impressed by the monologues and little details in Good Will Hunting?\n\nPietro Scalia's editing is very slick as he cuts from quiet scenes of reflection to noisy conversations that friends have to randomly goof around. Scalia's editing choices make Good Will Hunting's 127 minutes to fly by like a quick afternoon. Jean-Yves Escoffier's cinematography delivers soft close-ups indoors during therapy sessions that hit hard, while outdoors there are such warm tones and cute framing. His shots are now classic and remain timeless by their own virtues. He captures real feeling with his emotionally gripping shot choices. I love the medium shots of Casey Affleck or Matt Damon looking out a window while Ben Affleck drives them around Boston.\n\nDanny Elfman's sweet score is a symphony to sympathy. His caring melodies cradle the painful moments of touching drama within Good Will Hunting like a warm blanket. Beatrix Aruna Pasztor's costumes look well worn and realistic to the era and location. I love her cardigan sweaters for Robin Williams or her scarf choice for Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd. Missy Stewart and James McAteer's production design displays impoverished Boston homes that look like lived in shacks, while coming up with sleek and authentic feeling offices for the two university professors' offices.\n\nIn all, Gus Van Zant directed an iconic film for all audiences that teenagers and adults alike can enjoy.",

There's a snapshot moment in Mrs. Doubtfire of all movies where he shows his disappointment and pain. It's so deep and seems almost simultaneously despondent and yet irritable and creative pain.

            "content": "If there is any film that you can call \"perfect\" it's this one.\n\n\"That boy is wicked smaht.\"\n\nSYNOPSIS:\nWill Hunting (Matt Damon) seems to have everything you'd want from unparalleled intelligence to incredibly loyal friends to the most loving girlfriend, but even with all of this Will still keeps a wall between him and everything he cares about. A life that would appear to be so simple, is in fact a lot more complex than it seems.\n\nDIRECTION:\nGus Van Sant directs this thing to near perfection. Through his direction there is so much life and grounding added to a story that otherwise seems quite plain. Knowing at which points to change the focus of the camera from one character to the next. Knowing when to hold a close up to really cease a beautiful scene and capture the expression. Now, I'm not going to sit here and act like no one else could've directed this film, however, a film like this could've easily been ruined by poor directing and editing. Great work.\n\nWRITING:\nMatt Damon and Ben Affleck really knocked this one out of the park. Not only was both of their acting on-point, but the dialogue in the film is so pure. There are so many memorable moments in this film just from incredible dialogue. It feels as if there's not a single line in this film that goes unnoticed or should be cut. If the heart could write a script I'm pretty sure this screenplay is what would be the result. This film definitely deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar that it won.\n\nACTING:\nIt's not your fault. It's not your fault. I swear Robin Williams had me screaming \"I KNOW, SEAN!\" followed by aggressive tears from the guilt I felt that I never actually had a reason to feel, but damn you Robin Williams. On top of that, Matt Damon, how dare you memorize ridiculously intellectual monologues like the one at the Harvard Bar scene and the one that cut from you being at a job interview with the CIA or whoever to you being seated in Sean's office. I'm starting to feel this is an autobiography. Are those just books? I don't know. Shut up. Then moving on the Ben Affleck who is my dream best friend. One I can confide in and a man who will willingly go to my job interviews in an over-dramatic BAHSTON accent acting as a pretentious douche. Yes, please! Minnie Driver. That heartbreaking scene over the phone... \"I love you.\" Say it back... SAY IT BACK, WILL! What a killer Irish accent by the way. Not an Irish bone in my body, but trust me... killed that accent. Stellan Skarsgard, I understand how much you care for him Stellan, but he doesn't want to be a damn mathematician. Do you know how easy it is for him?! DO YOU? And Casey Affleck, stop worrying about your damn double burger. I do have to acknowledge how resourceful you were with that baseball glove though. *Tips the hat* \nI realize I just pretty much reiterated lines from the film, but the acting is so damn good that I don't even know what else to say. It's so amazing. I will say this film does possibly have the worst performance of anyone ever, however. Professor Lambeau's assistant. He looked and sounded like he was continuously trying to put himself asleep during every scene he's in.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThis is my favorite film of all time. Though the directing is anything to go crazy about, the writing and the acting in this film, elevates this film to an entire different dimension for me. I can watch this film on repeat 24 hours a day. Actually, make that like 16. Sleep is essential to get another productive 16 hours of Good Will Hunting. That's my review.",

Robin Williams\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) roll in this movie just makes you love him even more. RIP Robin. Wow who knew Robin Williams and Matt Damon would be some of the best acting ever. Amazing chemistry between the two. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s crazy how smart and bright Damon\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s character is. He just needs an attitude adjustment and to come to terms with all the shit that\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s happened to him in life that got him to where he is now. \n\nThe whole saying, the funniest happiest people are actually the saddest inside, is so true.

I don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t think they could\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)ve casted a more better person than Robin to play his part. \n\nI think it\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s amazing how Will came into all of these different people\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s lives and just completely changed them around.

Beautiful and very inspiring movie. It just goes to show that even the poorest and most misfortuned people in the world can possess talents, skills, and intelligence that more fortunate people can have or might have.

This vivacious film runs on nothing but the merit of the script. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the writers, aren't bringing anything new on the table, but it is the Disney of the dramatic movies. Incredibly confident in its ingredients, the film never stutters, not even for a frame. What's been so crowd pleasing about the script, is its ability to create a topsy-turvy world in a pragmatic one. Usually, the concept of \"power\" in the hand is often presented as misused by the characters and also always is craved by them.\n\nIn here, Matt Damon who powerfully portrays a guy that accounts in, his photographic memory as a hindrance. His surrounding doesn't ask him to repel it, but his affection towards that very surrounding and the fear to go physically distant with it, makes him turn all this into a hobby. Damon's excruciating performance of an arrogant and blessed kid has a match that makes him rubble in a snap.\n\nAnd the answer is Robin Williams, that cloaks in a completely opposite persona to Damon in order to get in, in his game. If Damon likes to hurt, he keeps his wound open, if Damon oozes power and rage, he whispers warmth so gently that it makes your eyes teary within a blink. And despite of all the other tracks sprinkled amazingly in the film, Williams and Damon sharing a few laughs sitting in the room is the best asset of it, that Gus Van Sant is well aware of and encourages it like some big antic to stand tall and proud upon. Good Will Hunting is never a hunt, if anything it is the surrender in a long lasting lost game, that actually our host never cares for.",

When Van Sant came on board, Robin Williams (already a superstar) signed up.  I skipped this in the 1990s but I thought I would fill in this gap now.  Damon plays a kid from Boston who has genius-level math ability but is self-taught and full of anger and defensiveness.  When he is discovered/rescued by a math professor (Stellan Skarsg\u00c3\u00a5rd), the deal is that he can stay out of jail only if he attends both math workshops and therapy.  No therapist can handle his challenges until Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), also from working class South Boston and the professor\u00e2(TM)s former college roommate, is brought in.  At the same time, Will Hunting (Damon) continues to hang out with his school mates, the two Afflecks included, and while at a bar, he meets Skylar (Minnie Driver, in a charismatic performance) and they start a romance.  Will\u00e2(TM)s avoidant attachment style (developed through harsh treatment at the orphanage where he grew up) nearly causes him to throw away his career in maths and his new romance with Skylar.  Of course, with the loving mentoring of Williams (underplaying dramatically), he breaks through the wall. In a movie like this, it isn\u00e2(TM)t a spoiler, is it?  This is all about the final \u00e2feel good\u00e2? moment \u00e2\" which also reduces the film\u00e2(TM)s artistic merits (i.e., its been given the Hollywood treatment which you can see coming from a mile away).  The psychologizing is probably a bit too pat as well. That said, there are many finely observed moments in the film and the actors work hard to give their characters some depth (even if not everyone can pull off the Boston accent). At the end of the day, it is probably a testament to Van Sant\u00e2(TM)s skill that this came off as well as it did; in the hands of a lesser director it could have been much soppier stuff.",

How could we not talk about Good Will Hunting with out talking about the magnificent performance from the great Robin Williams.

            "content": "Good Will Hunting is a 1997 drama that made 225.9 million dollars in box office earnings. It follows the story of Will Hunting, a 20 year old genius working as a janitor at MIT. While all his friends want him to do something with his life, he wants to stay where he is. After Will solves a graduate level math problem, Professor Gerald Lambeau is impressed with him, but Will soon gets arrested. Professor Lambeau makes a deal to keep Will out of jail, he has to study math with him and go to therapy once a week. Will refuses to take the therapy sessions seriously and multiple therapists refuse to talk to him again after only one session. Lambeau eventually goes to his former college roommate, Dr. Sean Maguire. Dr. Maguire gets Will to open up to him and helps him overcome his past and find what he wants. The purpose of the movie Good Will Hunting is to show that you only regret the chances you didn't take. I will show the purpose through plot, character, and conflict. \nYou only regret the chances you didn't take. That's how Dr. Sean Maguire feels about missing one of the greatest games in baseball history \"to see about a girl.\" After will asks him if he really missed game six of the World Series to have a drink with a girl, he tells him, \"I don't regret the 18 years I was married to Nancy. I don't regret the six years I had to give up counseling when she got sick. And I don't regret the last years when she got really sick. And I sure as hell don't regret missin' the damn game. That's regret.\" \nThroughout the film, Will's friends all want him to go to school, get a job, and do something with his life. Especially his best friend Chuckie. Every morning Chuckie hopes that Will's not home, that he finally left. He tells Will \"Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way. In twenty years, if you're still livin' here, comin' over to my house to watch the Patriots games, still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you.\" \"Hanging around here is a fuckin' waste of your time.\" He knows that Will is too smart to waste his life working construction when he could have an amazing job. Any one of their friends would kill for the opportunities Will has, yet he does nothing.\nThe main antagonist in Good Will Hunting is Will. The only thing holding him back from going to school and getting an amazing job is himself. When Professor Lambeau tells him he can be released as long as he does math and goes to therapy, Will laughs. He agrees to do the math but refuses to go to therapy. When he eventually gives in, he still doesn't take the therapy sessions seriously. He thinks he'll be happy where he is even though his friends know he's going to regret it eventually. After he talks to Dr. Maguire he realizes he needs to take the opportunity he's given.\nSome people say that the theme of Good Will Hunting is education, but that's only part of it. Yes Will needed to go to school, but he also needed the therapy sessions. Skylar was also a big part of the movie. Will needed the therapy sessions and Skylar to realize what he would be missing if he didn't take the opportunity. It wasn't just about school.\nGood Will Hunting was successful in showing the theme of regretting chances you never took. It was shown through Dr. Sean Maguire's character and throughout the plot of the movie. At the beginning he didn't care about his future but eventually he learned that he would regret passing up the opportunities that he was given.",

In between the thought-provoking scenes involving Damon and Williams is a clich\u00e9-ridden story told with characters that are not engaging nor have enough backstory for us, the audience, to care about. All I need to say is that it is a romance plot with the titular character and a girl and there's a misunderstood fight between them and....ugh....yeah. It's that same old 'song and dance' we all achingly know.\nIn fact, the effect the film had on me was a tug-of-war, pulling me back and forth between smart characters with smart dialogue and dumb characters with dumb dialogue. \nI'm teetering on the fence for \"Good Will Hunting\". I want to like this film, but I just can't stomach its amateur plot peppered with intelligent scenes. It (sadly) comes across as Hollywood trying to relate with the smart crowd and failing, which in turn, makes for a phony film.",

That because they have what we don't, there life is automatically better that ours. But that is not always true. Just because a man drives a better car than you, doesn't mean that he is going home to a better life. Good Will Hunting speaks to this concept in a unique way. By showing us a glimpse of a boy who could have anything, and yet is content with a life that is less than spectacular to say the least. And it is about another man's journey to show him that he is worth more. \n\tWill Hunting (Matt Damon) is a peculiar boy. He has the ability to think harder and more critically that anyone around him. But he would rather work as a janitor at Harvard, than attend. But one day while he is working, he sees a math theorem on a chalkboard and he solves it. As he is leaving, a Professor Lambau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) spots him and upon realizing what will has done, he proceeds to track will down, finding him in jail, due to Will's unruly attitude. The Professor convinces the Judge to put Will under his care on the condition that Will attend some math classes with him and that he see a therapist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) \n\tThis movie does a very good job at developing the relationship between its characters. They are all centered around Will, giving the movie a well-grounded feel. The movie knows what it is trying to prove and does it very well. Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's character has problem the worst relationship with Will, but that is only because he is the only one who could be seen as the antagonist. He wants Will to become the best he can be using his remarkable ability to think and learn. But in doing this, Skarsg\u00e5rd's character neglects Will's mental health and only thinks about what is good for his future. Robin Williams' character is different and it is his relationship with Will that carries this movie. In Williams' portrayal of physiatrist Sean Maguire, we see a man who character sees past Will incredible ability to think and can tell that he has had a hard life and that he is damaged into thinking he is less than what he is. He helps Will, first by showing him that just because he knows all the facts about everything, doesn't mean he know everything about everything. He is then able to help Will to realize that what happen to him in his childhood doesn't need to dictate his life.\n\t If there is something wrong with the movie, I would say it is the conflict. The idea is that Will needs to see a therapist because Professor Lambeau bailed him out of jail. But this is quickly forgotten as soon as we meet Sean. It just gives us the idea that things would go right back to the way they were if they were allowed to with no consequences. \n\tThis movie does a great job of showing us that we are more than just the thoughts in our brains. We matter, to ourselves and others, and that is worth more that money and fame. But it is important to be reminded of that from time to time. We like to feel loved and this movie helps us to realize that.",

One day, when he solves a seemingly impossible math problem, he finds himself under the mentorship of a few bright minds. Although he's got the potential to be basically anything he wants, his stubbornness and fears will push not only his mentors to the test, but himself.\n\nIf anything, watch this movie for the performances. A young Matt Damon and Ben Affleck should be enough to attract most people, but watching Robin Williams in one of his best films makes you feel like you're truly in the presence of greatness. The performances are all so amazing and I actually didn't expect Matt Damon to be this good. He plays this troubled teen who has so much potential but is so damaged that he refuses to do anything about it. I love his character and he's so relatable in so many ways. Ben Affleck's role wasn't too big, but he did co-write the film, so applause to him. I had never really seen a ton of Robin William's performances and seeing him in live action felt very real and genuine. I wasn't as happy with the late introduction of his character, but he was stellar none the less. Stellan Skarsgard also had a great performance with his stand out moments, and even Minnie Driver had her moments late in the game. \n\nThe screenplay was very well written in my opinion. It had a few stereotypes and predictable moments in there, and for the most part, it followed a fairly safe route. It did feel a little repetitive at times, as it felt like there were a lot of moments that followed the same dialogue structure and the biggest moments were fueled by purely dialogue. However, that's not always a bad thing, it just felt a little repetitive. It doesn't stray from the fact that I would replay certain scenes just for the monologues alone. \n\nThis movie is a great character study and it was so intriguing to learn more about these characters. There are so many relatable aspects that actually brought tears to my eyes. I smiled, I was impressed, and I wanted to cry all in one film. That's always a positive. \n\nNow, I wasn't in love with this movie. To me, there was nothing extremely unique about this film that I haven't necessarily seen before, but this movie is the favorite film of someone very close to me. With that being said, I know I'll be able to watch this film and smile, while remembering all of the happiness and tears it brought to someone's life. This film will always be considered a classic and I'm proud to own it in my collection.\n\nIn the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and although I didn't love it, it'll always hold a place in my heart for different reasons.",

This film does an amazing job at making you really sympathize and care about the characters without needing endless flashbacks and drawn out monologues about their past. You figure everything out through the amazingly written dialogue that, with the help of some superb performances by the whole cast, really tell an emotional story that grips you. None of the characters are perfect, they all have their own quirks and issues that they grapple with and personality traits some would deem undesirable. But you can't help to fall in love with them, especially with the main character Will (Matt Damon) and Sean (Robin Williams). The ending is open ended and doesn't give a fairy tale happy ending while still giving you the satisfaction of guessing what happens after the film closes. It's an incredibly satisfying film that is worthy of it's praise.",

Because beneath all that, it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful script written by two talented young men and acted out by equally talented actors such as Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable parts of the movie was the psychological aspect. We have a typical 21 year old, going out and drinking with his friends, getting in fights etc., but underneath all that there's so much more to him. This movie tells us that we shouldn't look at the surface alone, there is so much more to people.\n\nThe acting in this movie was incredible, Matt Damon played the role of Will Hunting without fault, he displayed the emotions, the cockiness, he displayed how Will was closed off due to his childhood trauma and he displayed how Will shrouded his weakness with smart talk and intellect. Robin Williams played the therapist Sean Maguire, a man who has seen life unlike the life his fellow academics have, on the battlefield in Vietnam. He recently lost his wife, who he regarded as his soulmate and best friend.\n\nMatt Damon plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his out of this world genius. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben Affleck. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship. Yes there is a girl in the movie, but there isn't much focus on that aspect.\n\nThe fact that most of the people keep on talking about the probability of someone being as smart as Will tells us that this is a story, that this isn't real. Even so it relates to almost everyone who has been at Will's age. They have dealt with insecurities, fear of not being accepted, etc.\n\nOverall, I think it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful message and amazing effort from everyone in the cast and crew. Especially from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who co-wrote the script for this movie. It is definitely a must watch",

That's not easy to do, but Van Sant achieves it in spades.\n\nThe meat of the film, however, comes from the beautiful subtext. This is a film with purpose. It's about individuality versus ability, self-worth versus self-sufficiency, knowledge versus wisdom, and striving to discover one's own purpose and fighting to achieve peace. \"Good Will Hunting\" is an important film.",

I thought the counseling scenes with Robin Williams were quite engaging and they made me care more than I expected I would. However that's about the only aspect of the movie that worked for me. I never feel like Matt Damon disappears into the role of Will, so every emotional moment just feels like obvious acting. His friends added nothing to the movie for me, and Ben Affleck is an even worse actor. Yet the real sticking point I had was that, in a strange way, I found myself sympathizing with Stellan Skarsgard. I thought the movie was more engaging when it was exploring Will's genius, instead of his emotions. That's not to say it is a bad movie, but I didn't think it was anything all that special or unique. I could watch a dozen TV movies about damaged kids trying to move past their emotional detachment, but the diamond in the rough story is one that feels more cinematic and I thought needed to take center stage. Perhaps Good Will Hunting is just not a film that works for me, because clearly others love it.",

There isn't one thing that sticks out in this movie but is instead just overall such a solid piece. However after watching this movie year after year I can put my thumb on some of the aspects in this movie that does make it work. One positive of this movie was Matt Damon, he didn't just act as his character but became his character. This is because of Damon's understanding of his character, this is because Damon created his character. Matt Damon knew exactly what he was trying to create and was able to display it perfectly in this movie. Matt Damon is only complimented by Ben Afflecks, Robin Williams, and others roles. The development of the characters also work so well, none feel forced and it actually creates some suspense.\n\nThis movie also had a certain it factor to it. This movie has an undeniable it factor that connects to the audience like no other. This is created by the environment and attitude this movie creates. This movie sucks the audience into its own world and works so well.\n\nIn conclusion Good Will Hunting is a must watch and a true classic that will continue to change lives just like mine.",

It sort of reminded me of Ordinary People, which focused on a therapist/boy relationship. It's a wonderful script. One of the smartest ones ever written. The performances are spectacular, even after so many years. Yes, I wholeheartedly agree, this is the best performance of Robin William's career. This was one of the few time when award season truly got it right. He is magnificent here. I adored his character. Hindsight really helps, however. You can unfortunately see the dark, devastated side of Robin that lurked beneath his hilarious exterior showing itself throughout this performance. This is what depression looks like. This was, in fact, the real Robin Williams, and we lost him because of it. If you thought Good Will Hunting was sad then, it's even sadder now. Still, you'd be stupid not to watch it at least once.",

This is the type of movie I love. A movie about human struggle, human emotion, and human relationships, where the plot buildups aren't manufactured, but are real(or at least appear real). This is a masterpiece.\n\nWill Hunting is a janitor at MIT, who lives in a rundown one bedroom apartment in South Boston. He spends his nights drinking with his friends and looking for trouble. Will has been in trouble a lot, mostly assault charges and after he gets into another fight, the judge is about to throw the book at him. In his spare time, however, Will is an avid reader and a mathematical genius. After he solves a problem on a chalkboard at MIT, that few ever have; a professor tracks him down and gets him out of jail. The terms- that he works with the professor and sees a counselor. Soon Will is excelling at his work with the professor, but is guarded about his past and scared of his future.\n\nThe performances in Good Will Hunting are extraordinary. Matt Damon gives, what I believe to be, his best performance. He exudes pain and emotion, in a powerful performance. Robin Williams is equally as haunting, as Will's psychiatrist, who tries to get Will to open up and see his potential. Minnie Driver gives a great performance as Will's love interest. As good as the performances are, the best aspect of the movie is the great script by Damon and Affleck and solid direction from Gus Van Sant. \n\nThere are a lot of powerful moments through out Good Will Hunting, but none more than when Will finally reveals his past to the love interest, Skyler. It's a scene so real, not forced, not manufactured, but something that comes about in a natural progression of great storytelling. If you haven't seen Good Will Hunting, it is one that you should seek out.",

            "content": "Grade: Just gets in at 8/10\n\nGood Will Hunting is a movie that gets so many people talking, it is loved by many and the performances too. I felt as I watched just why do so many love it, I didn't think it was perfection but there is no doubt this is an interesting piece of cinema with it's smart plot and emotionally charged characters. I did feel it was very good and although only just about, it still manages to really let you enjoy it.\n\nThe first thing to say about this is Robin Williams who is at his very best here. He just feels so excellent as his role as Sean Maguire who as you will see councils Will Hunting and he adds an extra element to this movie Robin does. All the cast are fairly strong here, Matt Damon as Will is good and really shows us what he has got for his future film career. Cast such as Ben Affleck aren't really shown as much as the two I mentioned but him among his brother Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard form a good little cast for this type of film. \n\nBen Affleck and Matt Damon of course write the movie and they do a great job, not only capturing everyday life situations well, but adding in Will Hunting to those scenes to make it feel smart and funny. I did however feel it was slightly contrived, mostly in the way they want to get a certain emotion out of you, sometimes you can laugh and sometimes you can be sad, even times when they want you to think \"Oh wow he's smart that Will Hunting\". I will also add that the script though is really showcasing the talent these two guys have, and I do feel like these guys really are an example to look up to when aspiring screenwriters come up.\n\nGus Van Sant directs it well and his job is made easier by the fine script brought to him. He manages to delicately direct it without making the film feel done before or too much like a typical piece of cinema. Van Sant also could be said to contribute to Williams performance and you can see Gus really worked well with the cast to make them bring the most out of the script. Another delicate thing is the score, now when you making a film about a genius from Boston, Danny Elfman doesn't always spring to mind but he manages to beautifully score it and the music is really one thing I remember the most about watching the movie.\n\nOne good thing about the movie is that it is smart, not only in movie terms but in terms of the script and the actors who all seem to remember there lines so well, it almost feels like they all know mathematics like we see in the film. I think all the credit goes to Affleck and Damon who if I'm not mistaken, are not mathematic geniuses but do the screenplay in such a way that it feels like a professor has written parts of the film.\n\nOverall it is the ending that is the real pay off, of course I'm not going to ruin it for you but lets just say it makes you feel emotion and really draws you close to the characters we see so much of in this movie. Overall this is totally worth a watch, not only for people thinking \"It's Oscar nominated, it must be good\", but also people who just want an interesting film, not for those who want action or true thrills but it is definitely one for the thinkers and maybe even the unidentified genius.",

The fact that he's incredibly smart isn't the bulk of his character. It's moreso about how he chooses to use it, if at all, and what the people around him think he should do. A lot of different outlooks on what his intelligence is meant for come about. It's used as an engine to explore what it really means to get the most out of life. I liked seeing his evolution from start to finish, from a smart douche bag to a likable douche bag, and finally to a very complex person I sympathized with entirely.\n\nOn a technical side, it's all great. Great screenplay, nice acting, solid pacing, and a plot that wasn't at all predictable. The score was a peculiar choice: all the tracks are very light and have a sense of whimsy, which really only seemed to match up with the movie's tone towards the end. I liked it, though.

The movie follows the emotional story of a janitor that works at Harvard school and is extremely smart but as his past emotions come back to haunt him, he becomes confused with the direction he wants to take. Matt Damon and Robin Williams play the main characters, Will and Sean, and are perfectly cast in these roles. The two have the best chemistry out of pretty much any movie I've ever seen. It's crazy. These two have pasts that haunt them and sort of plays a factor in their understanding for each other. The stories of how they were treated when they were younger were tragic and really messed up. How Will was beaten with a wrench as a kid is really wrong and depressing. The conversations that Will and Sean have are part of the reason why I love this movie. They tell really relatable stories and can really touch a certain audience. The acting really throughout the whole movie is really good. Ben Affleck and Minnie Driver are the big standouts. The movie is pretty funny too, whenever Will is with his friends, I was laughing quite a bit. It's funny how this film is able to be really dramatic and emotional but make you crack a smile every once and a while. As for the ending of the movie, I was thinking \"you know what would make this movie really awesome? If Will went to California to be with Skylar\" (spoiler alert) I'll just say I loved the ending! The music, the atmosphere, the dialogue of that ending was just perfect. Good Will Hunting is an inspirational, relatable, funny, emotional, and awesome movie. A",

It's got some stunning performances too. Will Hunting (Damon) is a janitor who works at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he's from South Boston and never had much of an education, but he happens to be a genius, a self-taught one too. But instead of doing something with his life, he spends much of his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie (Affleck), Billy (Cole Hauser), and Morgan (Casey Affleck). When Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) discovers Will's gift, he decides to help him. After getting Will out of jail after a fight, the condition is Will do maths with Lambeau, and be counselled by Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), who is determined to help Will and his demons. It's a great little character piece with some colourful characters, and it's also a love letter to Damon and Affleck's native Boston too. They rightfully won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for their script, while the story might be predictable, it's the characters that drive the story along, and it's very sharp and observant.",

After he's discovered by an MIT professor and put under his supervision as a result of an assault charge, he's suddenly faced with a lot of important decisions.\u00a0\n\nGus Van Sant's direction here is flawlessly old school. Long, lingering shots with minimalist camera work and just the right amount of emotion makes for some beautifully restrained work. Think David Fincher's work with the Social Network but with less cutting. The nature of the film demands a careful balance of humour and emotion and Van Sant never drops the ball. When it's supposed to be funny, you'll be laughing. When you're meant to be sad, there will be tears. Despite his often childlike apporach to the material, he is able to be unflinchingly mature in the moments that call for it. It's this versatility which is the mark of a great director that Van Sant displays so intuitively here.\u00a0\n\nGood Will Hunting also features one of Danny Elfman's more diverse compositions, a bittersweet combination of keys and strings with a lilting pipe tune which stays with you for a while. It may verge on twee on the odd occassion but it's used with enough restraint that it doesn't become a crutch or substitute for real emotion. The real standout of the soundtrack is Elliott Smith's Oscar nominated song \"Miss Misery.\" Hitting just the right note, his full stop at the end of the film is sweetly depressing as well as marking a new chapter for our main character.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking of the Academy Awards, one of the biggest draws of the film is the Oscar winning script penned by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Thirteen years on and it's still as powerful as it ever was, managing to walk the line between stilted and realistic with an uncanny instinct for everyday conversations and natural dialogue. Even Will's super smart outbursts are grounded by the film's realistic feel. But the screenplay's greatest achievement is the raw emotion that it is capable of evoking. Scenes such as Skylah and Will's fight in the dorm room linger in the mind long after the final credits have rolled. In particular the dialogue between Will and Sean is incredibly powerful, their exchanges both layered and meaningful. Their relationship development is incredibly rewarding, moving from the sizing up of two boys from Southie to two friends with grace and realism. The elegance and simplicity of the plot is astoundingly straightforward with no sudden, attention seeking twists or unstable divergences, instead focussing on extracting every moment of nuance and emotion from various conversations between the characters. It's an incredible achievement, especially in light of the fact that it's the writing debut of Damon and Affleck.\u00a0\n\nThe two of them don't let down in the acting department either, with both of them turning in brilliant performances. Damon's character is the main character of the piece and as such his performance is more rewarding in depth and evolution but Affleck does well with the screentime allotted to him. He is funny and loudmouthed as well as playing the role of Will's best friend with uncharacteristic restraint. Damon's performance easily outshines him, however, moving from dangerously inflamed to easy-going with style. Jason Bourne may be his best known character but his performance here is so beautifully vulnerable and simply realistic that it's easily his best performance to date. His love interest in the film is a delightful Minnie Driver who is able to evoke a goofy sense of humour at times while being undeniably powerful in the more emotional scenes. But the star here is Robin Williams, the manic stand-up bringing forth an incredible performance filled with nuance and humour as well as depth and vulnerability. His delivery of some exquisitely crafted speeches make an incredible document almost obsolete with such astounding timing and realism that it's difficult to tell where the acting ends and Williams begins. He is quietly, understatedly brilliant in the midst of an incredible cast.\u00a0\n\nWith an eternally brilliant script, beautiful direction and amazing performances all round, Good Will Hunting is as close to perfect as movies get.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nTough one to pick but it has to be Sean and Will's second meeting. A rivetting piece of acting from Williams combined with one of the best monologues in the film.",

The relationship between Will and Skylar is straight-up heartbreaking. The cinematography suddenly becomes amazing. Danny Elfman's score is minimalistic, but still strong and bold enough to accent the emotion on-screen with precision. Ben Affleck is amazing.\n\nThere are films where I get a knot in my throat.

            "content": "Released to near universal critical acclaim in 1997, Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting is a youth film, written by its young stars, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, at the very beginning of their respective careers, largely memorable due to its incredibly effective distillation of the hubristic follies of young adulthood, charming in its innate self-assuredness, a veritable Catcher in the Rye of the late 1990's. And yet, much of the film is carried on the shoulders of the Oscar winning supporting role given by the late, great comic actor Robin Williams, whose turn as Damon's therapist is moving in its authenticity, belying the respective artifice of the surrounding drama, including Damon's titular role, the film clinging to Williams' inability to turn in a false performance, his deep well of humanity imbuing the film with all of the empathy that the script lacks even the awareness of. Likewise, Van Sant feels aimless and lost in his direction of the film, unable to take the viewer anywhere interesting or tangible, moving from one passing point of interest to another without providing a larger dramatic context for much of the film's capricious ennui, the entire film shapeless and ephemeral, tonally and thematically vacant. Damon and Affleck have both proven themselves to be creative and capable performers, but Good Will Hunting is not their greatest work, marking it as something of an oddity, its credible encapsulation of the universality of youth its simultaneous flaw, the film coming off as prophetically hopeful for a future that is still unrealized in the minds of its protagonists, not to mention its screenwriters. For all intents and purposes, Good Will Hunting is a good movie, capturing the aimless antics of its precocious miscreant accurately, but without grasping the larger poeticism of his world, Van Sant's film in the same state of arrested development as its subject.\n\nThroughout the film, Damon's Will Hunting is presented to the audience as an immediately likable protagonist, troubled by a past that remains as vague to the audience as it does to the film itself, Hunting's history of domestic abuse at the hands of his foster father as believable as any of the other lies Hunting employs over the course of the film in order to remain detached, immune, and incapable of the responsibilities of adulthood, as personified by Stellan Skarsgard's professorial interest in Hunting's innate mathematic abilities. Despite the script's sophomoric good will towards Hunting's trials and tribulations, his memorable wooing of Minnie Driver's moneyed pre-med student made problematic by his own self-loathing and lack of self-worth, much of the internal drama feels shallow, lifted from greater scripts and stories to no effect when translated to the film's dramatization of working class Bostonians. Left with no scriptural evidence for his protagonist's deep soulfulness, Van Sant is forced to shoot several sequences in which Damon lounges with an air of disgruntlement, his constant slouching and listless gaze indicative of a humanity that is dramatically absent, leaving the film cinematically listless as well. Damon and Affleck attempt to gain the audience's sympathy again and again, imploring the viewer through scene after scene of weighty dialogue, attempting to present Hunting as a misguided Boston tough worthy of praise and upward mobility, his erudite and pithy demeanor one worth saving. And yet, for all of the empathy that the script seems to feel for Hunting, Hunting feels none for the viewer, divorcing Van Sant's film of the empathy in its protagonist that is necessary for any dramatic catharsis to feel well earned, as opposed to the abrupt inconclusiveness on display in Hunting's climactic departure for California.\n\nIn order for a film about the turmoil of youth to work, there must be a base line from which the audience may empathize with the film's protagonist, and that protagonist must in turn be capable of empathy, else the audience feel disconnected from the film in much the same way that the protagonist feels disconnected from the world. At the time when Good Will Hunting was written, Damon and Affleck were barely out of their 20's themselves, and thus still caught up in their own personal journeys of self-discovery, lending their script much of the tumultuous and unformed aura of their own respective immaturities at the time. While some of this irreverence for and of the world undoubtedly lends the film much of its viscerally driven appeal, Damon's Will Hunting and Affleck's Chuckie Sullivan as eager to move onward and upward as the stars themselves, this eagerness largely comes off as ignorant navel gazing, assuredly striving towards something greater that is still clouded by the ego of young adulthood. After all, one of the most deceptive aspects of youth is its assuredness that everything is easily remedied, as one's solutions at the time predominantly extend only so far as to help oneself, the larger world still far off in the realm of full blown maturity and a more worldly understanding of other people's needs, hopes, and desires as compared to your own. Will Hunting definitively reaches personal discovery by film's end, but his decision to leave town without letting anyone know, including his new employers, marks his final decision as one made without any forethought, his development in a state of continual arrested self-involvement, getting the girl but not coming of age, marking Van Sant's film as shallow and incomplete, its centripetal preoccupation with youth as stunted and belligerent as an unruly teenager.\n\nFor all of its atonality and narrative missteps, Good Will Hunting is persistently watchable, carried by Robin Williams' respective maturity and empathy, lending Damon's Will Hunting just enough humility and pathos to evoke sympathy in the viewer for his plight. And yet, despite the compelling likability generated by Williams' award worthy performance, the sympathy that is generated in the viewer comes off as overtly manipulative, marking the film as the irretrievable dramatic failure that it always has been, a youth film where the adult is the real hero. Where other great coming of age masterpieces situate their young protagonists at the moral center, Damon's Will Hunting must be taught empathy from an elder, his own ability to emote stunted by a preoccupation with the self that proves to be too all-consuming to allow for any true dramatic progression on his own terms, causing the film to sputter and gasp for air in a deluge of self-pity and painfully rendered, self-aggrandizing monologues, apologetic, but never sincere. Contrastingly, Mike Nichols' 1967 opus, The Graduate, imbues Dustin Hoffman's anti-hero with all of the morals and guilt that should by all rights be found in his elders, which is why the ending is so satisfying, the two youths escaping one corrupt adult world for another of their own potential making and subsequent undoing; in a similar vein, Robert Redford's 1980 tragedy, Ordinary People, is moving in the way in which it leaves Timothy Hutton's emotionally scarred survivor, having braved his way through both literal and figurative storms only to find himself alone on the shore, finally a man, but weighed down with all of the trappings and responsibilities rightly associated with his newfound maturity. Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting is as harrowing and tumultuous a drama as either of these two greater films, but without any sense of true progression, dramatic or otherwise, Damon's titular youth in much the same way as he was at the start of the film, sympathetic perhaps, but incapable of the type of empathy that is necessary to the youth film genre's continued relevance and poetic resonance, Will Hunting respectively withdrawn and figuratively restrained, Van Sant's film a study in emotional stagnancy.",

            "content": "The wonderful thing about certain films is that they can resonate with you as a person, you can feel the characters pain or anguish because you have been through a smiliar process. For me, Good Will Hunting, strikes those chords and its not because i think im a genius who should be doing something better with his life, its because the main message of this film is so strong that everyone on the planet can relate to it. Good Will Hunting, follows the story of a troubled youth called Will, He and his friends, typically go out, they drink, they get in fights. In fact Will actually has quite the criminal history. The flip side is he is one of the smartest mathematitions around. He is noticed by Jerry, a Lecturer at one of Americas most prestigious universities after Will has secretly been completely extremely complex algorythms. Jerry decides to go out on a limb and come to an agreement with the courts. If Jerry works with Will every week and also gets Will to successfully endure therapy, the judge will drop the case. Cue Sean, one of Jerry's old friends from college, the only therapist to relate with Will, trying to set him on the correct path. Good Will Hunting is a master stroke of genius. Its hard to believe that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, the 2 co stars of this movie wrote the thing, the dialogue, although a bit forced in some places, is some witty, so intellectual and thoughtful to think that 2 kids could come up with that, is amazing. It also helps that the talent behind this film is immense. Gus Vant Sant directs, Lawrence Bender, Kevin Smith and the Weinsteins all produce. The cast, which includes, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Stellan Starsgard, Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and of course the late great Robin Williams are all absolutely on the button, it sends this film into the stratosphere. The relationships here are all genuine and heart braking. Wither it be the heart aching relationship between lovers Will and Skyler or Will and Sean, every relationship has a meaning, it has weight, it has an important reason to be within the film. Which is why at no point does the film include any forced material or even needless material. The acting ranges from good to superb. Matt Damon, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Williams and Casey Affleck all knock it straight out of the ball park. Ben Affleck works well enough as Will's best friend, however his character is a little under developed and under utilized. Minnie Driver is also reasonable but kind of gets swept under the carpet here by the surrounding talent. The pacing is wonderful, you are never board, you are never twiddling your thumbs waiting for something monumental to happen, your too engrossed on the screen. Van Sant gets us up close and personal with his characters also, even in some of the rawest moments between Williams and Damon, after Will rubs up his therapist about his dead wife, the camera is right up in the action, right in the emotion. You cant help but feel the surge of power come from their performances. The film looks great and over 15 years old, it still looks the part, it almost feels timeless. It could almost be set in modern day. There are very few things wrong with this movie, yeah there are a couple of minor characters who are just in there to fill the screen at points and some of the dialogue, mostly between the younger characters can be a bit forced and dated but it doesnt take away from the over all experience. Finally, now more than ever, and not that this film should be judged on the credentials of one actor, but watching this film after Williams departure with us, serves as a reminder of what a loss we truely have experienced in the film world. His therapy during the film is heart  braking, to watch him re-tell stories of him and his wife, or try and make Will understand what life is all about, knowing the troubles he later went through in life, still makes for a very hard watch. It's difficult to not get teary eyed while watching this film. But that is not a bad thing, that serves as an ode to Williams and the sheer dominance he had at his job. A brilliant film, with brilliant performances and a fantastic script. A must see.",

It is great to see that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's first movie that they wrote and Ben Affleck getting appreciated from his directing and writing from his later movies. There are unforgettable moments in this that lots of people are going to be quoting and remember. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Minnie Driver is really good, and the chemistry between Robin Williams and Matt Damon is one of the best parts in the movie.

Acres could be written on the similarities and differences between Sean Maguire and John Keating. But that's for another time. Because Good Will Hunting is far more than Robin Williams/Sean Maguire. Yes, Williams is top billed in the film, but quite rightly his Oscar has the word \"Supporting\" engraved on it.  Williams IS amazing, but he's one cog in a sensational ensemble cast - not a rotten apple in the bunch. The perfs are all fearless and peerless. I especially love the Chuckie scenes. Yet Affleck and Damon excel at the writing as much as the acting. Williams' monologue about meeting his wife is golden, but Skarsgard is gifted with some poetry too. And the scene between Will and Chuckie at the building site is my favourite of many. How do I like them apples? I like 'em quite a bit.",

Once again Robin Williams is able to perform a dramatic role with such direction and and class, however it is his little touches of comedy that make him such a remarkably haunting and rememberable character and his performance most certainly deserved the Oscar. Matt Damon too gives an incredibly talented performance with drive and intensity I was not expecting. It is also fortunate that the screenplay and the direction of the film, if not a little predictable, can match the performances to create such an emotional and heart touching story of development within Matt Damon's title character. It is this character development too, that is done with perfect pace and nice added aspects such as Hunting's relationship with the spectacular Minnie Driver character, or his loyalty to his friends, that makes the film so grasping, truly showing off the feeling and emotions of a troubled boy. I also enjoyed how the film did not just focus on the development of Hunting and was able to highlights Will's effect on both Sean McGuire (Williams) and Jerry Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard and the associated impact he has on their lives. This film reaks of rich character development, incredibly emotional scenes and intense performances to  sweep away its expected outcome and predictable scenes and come out pretty good, surprisingly funny and entertaining.",

            "content": "This is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. Everybody that stars in this movie is fantastic, including Ben Affleck. Director Gus Van Zant who directed \"Drugstore Cowboy,\" and \"Milk,\" has made without a doubt one of the best movies of the 1990's. It's such an emotional and wonderful movie to watch that it sticks with you the moment your done watching it. Matt Damon in my opinion gives the best performance of his career in this movie playing Will Hunting, the genius kid from South Boston who solves the big math equation that Stellan Skarsgard's character leaves in the hallway for his the students to solve to only have it mysteriously solved by Damon's character who happens to be the janitor of the college he works at. But for me it's really Robin Williams that sticks out the most for me just because it's Robin freakin' Williams, who gives in my opinion a career defining performance as the therapist that tries to help counsel Damon's character in order to keep him out of jail for getting into a brawl with Affleck and the rest of the crew against these Italians that hang out in the South Boston area and hits a cop in the process of being pulled back from almost beating one of the Italian guys to death. It's a very human performance, one that makes this one very different from all the other performances he has done on screen. It's the one that definitely made him worth of the best supporting oscar that year in 1997. Sure he cracks some good jokes here and there in the film, but he never shies away from his dramatic side through out the movie. Williams has played a lot of great characters on screen, but when I think about which one is my favorite, this performance is the first one to enter my head. I can't say enough about his performance because it felt so real to me the whole time, especially when he goes into talking to Damon's character about his wife who in the film has been dead for two years, but you can clearly see he is still grieving from the loss. And could you blame him? I mean for a man who loved his wife as much as he did in this movie you can see how hard it would be for a person like William's character to move on with his life. It's really when him and Damon really get into it in one therapy session about what Damon's character wants to do with his life and he can't give Williams character a straight answer and when tries to kick Damon out of the therapy session, that's when Damon confronts him and tells him that even though he lost a big hand that some people after losing a big hand like that have the sack to get back up and try again...and he's right. Both men are very compelling in the film and what makes the movie so great is the interaction between Damon and Williams that through the therapy sessions, both men learn to heal and move on with their lives, that's what makes the movie so great. I literally balled my eyes out when I was watching the movie last night with my sister at the scene when Williams character tells Damon that it's not his fault to what happened to him as a foster child, but Damon's character doesn't want to hear it, but Williams keeps pursuing Damon to realize that it is not your fault that were abused it was the asshole foster father that is to blame for beating him. And what makes it so great is that at one point Damon gets defensive and pushes Williams away telling him not to fuck with him, but Williams doesn't let down and keeps telling him it's not your fault. And when the two men finally embrace each other and hug it out it's truly a work of art, and in that scene Gus Van Zant definitely deserved the best director nomination for the movie. Such a compelling scene that I'm almost feeling the emotions as I'm writing this. This is a movie that will live on through the ages, and it should, because this is a movie that hits you where it hits best...right in the heart.",

Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgard and even Casey Affleck are all spectacular.

Despite loving his mainstream roles, I was keen to explore 'good will hunting' due to the overwhelming appraisal it received. It tells an interesting tale of a child genius who's talents are seemingly going to waste working as the colleges janitor. The reasons for Wills reluctance are soon expertly explored by Sean (Williams), creating for some very thought provoking and slickly executed scenes. Our leads gradual development; and eventually surprising decision, is fascinating to watch, yet were it not for the great acting I would expect them to be considerably dull. Having watched a few of Damon's earlier performances, I'm beginning to think that he has got worse as an actor. This may of course be due to the type of monotonous role that he is often put into, although he definitely manages to portray much more passion and emotion in this when compared to his other work. Williams however is undoubtedly the star of the show. His dialogue and demean is a joy to behold, so as to keep the film interesting.\n\nDespite the ending being expectantly charming, I did feel as though it lacked drama and punch. The romantic element; which ultimately plays a much larger role than expected, is also somewhat weak. This is perhaps Damon's downfall, as he often looks lost when trying to portray the right emotion in response to the female attention. However in general I enjoy what it had to offer, without finding it overly exciting or pungent, although the acting is first class.",

This remains one of my favorite movies, a nearly perfect little dynamo, which I would give a perfect 5 to if it had a better title.  The lame title is its one real flaw, and a pretty irrelevant one.  At the time, much was made over how these kids (yet to become the massive stars they would shortly) had written it themselves and made it happen, and indeed there is a wondrous sense of the amateur about this movie, amateur in the best and original sense of the word.  The movie is warm, funny, witty and cathartic.  And then there is the late, dearly missed Robin Williams,  whose film career is notable for being by turns wonderful and horrible.   Here, he is as marvelous as he's ever been.  Little note: anyone who sniffs about his Boston accent, it is barely noticeable, I actually didn't think he was attempting one at all it until it was pointed out to me.  \n\nI'm clearly not the only one enchanted by this movie, which still has a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  How do you like them apples?",

The cast here is well chosen, and the film is terrific in the way that it tells a powerful, memorable story. The script which was written by Affleck and Matt Damon is a terrific piece of writing, and the result shows on-screen, as this is a picture that is sure to grab your attention from start to finish due to its energetic story and intricate performances that really stand out. Good Will Hunting is an accomplished drama, a picture that is sure to appeal to any viewer that enjoys a well crafted work of drama, Gus Van Sant's direction is terrific as well, and he delivers one of his finest films. Robin Williams is also a noteworthy cast member and he can definitely a dramatic role, which really shows off his range, and he did that so well in Dead Poets Society and he would later deliver a blistering, tense performance in One Hour Photo. Here, he is stunning, and opposite Damon, steals the show. Matt Damon would make other stunning picture, but here, he takes on a great role, one that is conflicted, and well fleshed out, and Matt Damon really brings that to light here. He brings out the best out of the character, and he is perfect for the part. With a great script, great cast, and effective, immaculate direction, Good Will Hunting is a stunning picture, one that is thoroughly engaging from start to finish, and it is a highly captivating picture that you won't forget. This is the type of picture that sticks with you long after you've seen, and it's also a film well worth revisiting again and again. The film also showcased the writing talents of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, of which Affleck would later write some stunning films such as The Town and Argo, but here, this was a script he wrote when his career was taking off, and it's great to see that he showed terrific writing skills when his career was taking off. Good Will Hunting is a terrific picture, one that is well worth your time.",

He works as a janitor and he has a photographic memory. His gift allows him to excel in the field of mathematics but chooses to live a life drinking with his friends and not fulfilling his life's potential.\nWith his life slowly crashing and burning he gets help from a university professor and a psychiatrist to rebuild his life and solve the problems from his past and focus on his future.\n\nThis is a warm hearted movie, it may not seem like it initially as we're introduced to an intimidating Will Hunting but the movie sets it up and executes his motives quite effectively. \nThe group of friends he hangs out with is a lot of fun. Their constant jokes and mocking of each other cracks me up and makes me wish I have friends as awesome as they are. We are welcomed to their group and it is established who is the smart one, the dumb one, the best mate, you get it and it just wants me be involved so much.\nSeeing Robin Williams here is interesting. Just like in my recent review of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and seeing Jim Carrey play in a drama proved to be achieved in a believable and compelling way. The same goes for Williams. Both actors were famous for their outrageous comedic personalities and performances and now having them appear in dramas shakes my head in amazement. \nBack to William's character, he was solid, charismatic and likeable. He reminds me of the cuddly uncle I never had. The one who would give advice about life and share stories to his grandchildren, William's portrayed him very well.\n\nWhat sets the bar quite high here is the script and connection we have between all the characters. The dialogue is written so well with some perfect one liners, jokes and memorable quotes. Conversations aren't at all convenient and by that I mean written in a corny way or sappy fashion. Break up, conflict and social scenes are so natural and doesn't make it feel fake at any point.\n\n'Good Will Hunting' is a spectacular movie. It definitely fed me inspiration in a way a regular personal development speaker would not be able to. No surprise it won some Oscars. \nChances are after you see this it'll be part of your long term movie collection.",

It's all through Damon's brilliant performance that you like a character who could have just been so unlikeable. Robin Williams is just fantastic. I know he's very well remembered for roles like Mrs Doubtfire or Hook but I will always remember him for this amazing role. He's utterly brilliant here and he's just the nicest and most love able guy. I love just seeing him try and be friends with Will and when he starts yelling at him I'm completely with him. Ben and Casey Affleck are both brilliant, especially Ben who gives one of his best performances. Stellar Skarsgard is also fantastic. This film is so well directed by Gus Van Sant and while it's not the most flashy movie it's still one of his best. The writing is without a doubt the best aspect of this film as its so well written and all of the dialogue is brilliant, especially the bar scene which is hilarious.

Well, just yesterday, I was a sick puppy with stomach flu and seen this about to be on and was excited.\n\n\nAfter coming off the heels with To Die For, Gus Van Sant does something not too superb but heartbreaking, which is this film.\n\n\nCo-written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck with Damon in the title role and Affleck a costar, this story is about 20 year-old Will Hunting- a janitor at MIT with a dark past (abandoned, poor, and abused) and a bad attitude, he has nothing on his side except intelligence.\n\n\nThe guy devouring book after book, upper mathematics, and learns at a fast speed. He's a genius, but he would rather spend his time hanging out with his blue collar buddies in the south. After secretly solving a challenging math problem posed for students and impossible to solve, the professor seeks Will out. Due to some troubles with the law, he faces time in jail. But here's the catch, he has to do mathematics and has to go see a therapist, he eventually agrees.\n\n\nHe goes to see Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), the professor's college roommate, now a college professor who also had a dark past but is a gifted and smart consoler, Skylar (Minnie Driver), is a British girl at Harvard, who falls in love with Will and wants to help, and has his buddy Chuckie (Ben Affleck), all four of these people teaches him life edges.\n\n\nAt first, the plot may seem strange, Math? Therapy? Romance? Strange combination but it works.Gus Van Sant knows well with honest dialogue, like in the scene when Will and Skylar breakup because he feels he doesn't deserve her.\n\n\n\"Good Will Hunting\" is predictable but it's life edges is what makes it effective. It's deeply honest and sad. Damon and Affleck's first little script won Oscars and Robin Williams won Best Supporting Actor. This was worth the watch while having stomach flu.\n\nShane Zaborski",

One of those very rare movies in which when it ends, you just want more and more, praying they made a sequel book series or something. Not a sequel movie though, because that would only serve to taint the perfection of the original. When I saw the ending credits start to roll, I just sat there watching that car drive down the road because I had to process the fact that my mind had just been blown.

His sheer humanness has something to teach, or remind, us all: be vulnerable. Be vulnerable to vulnerability.\n\nAnd Will shows that that's not as easy as it sounds. It's scary, aye. It can hurt so much, aye. But it pays off. Eventually it'll pay off. We should not idealise our love. We should not fall in love with ideas of people. We should know them inside out; let them not be strangers but our doubles. The courage to do this, I believe, will be infectious. It'll bring warring nations together. Ironic, this: that courage is not the ability to hold up a sword against a Goliath, but to drop it, to leave the Goliath, that is cynicism and pain and fear itself, to get to us, eat us, slam us, do whatever it wants, for good or bad.\n\nGood Will Hunting rings of emotional truth: painful but unsentimental, serious but humorous, saddening but heartening.",

Together with the help of an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a psychologist (Robin Williams) he comes to understand his true potential. The best parts of the film are the many dialogue scenes, some emotionally deep and others biting, that add so much depth to the characters. This was a passion project for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and it shows. The dialogue felt natural and true to life, which adds to the authenticity of the overall experience. Though everyone (including Ben Affleck) turns in an excellent performance, Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good. Matt Damon is the hard-headed young adult who is afraid to let people in, and Robin Williams is a professor with experience and insight that he uses to get to Will. Even though the narrative structure wasn't the tightest, there was something to enjoy about every scene, and all of them added something to the overall picture. I should also mention that Minnie Driver does a great job as Will's girlfriend, and Casey Affleck has a few of the best lines. As far as other aspects go I enjoyed the score, which was never intrusive or told the audience how to feel. There was also a rather eclectic soundtrack which fit the moods of various scenes perfectly. Overall, it was a superbly written film with equally good performances. Highly recommended.",

This depresses me, because although these films are popular now, I don't see them becoming classics anytime in the future, and they are overhyped so much it degrades their actual quality. Good Will Hunting is nothing like this. This film is the definition of an instant classic, a stupendously written and emotionally powerful film that has three celebrated actors (Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and Ben Affleck) bringing their A-game. Not many movies are like this, which is both a good and a bad thing-- on one hand, if all movies were dialogue-driven dramas, people might be bored to tears. But at the same time, can't we ask for a little more intelligent scriptwriting from screenwriters these days?\r\n\r\nGood Will Hunting is one of the best films of the 1990s, and easily one of the best in general. Starring Matt Damon in his best role yet as a genius savant who can make complicated calculations and mathematical proofs in his head, and Robin Williams as his tenacious therapist, this emotionally gripping movie will absolutely knock you off your feet. Damon's conflicted character is one of the best ever created-- he is undoubtedly a genius, but lacks all motivation to act on it. The movie leaves the audience with an ambiguous ending. When you have an incredible gift, are you obligated to share it with the world, or should you chase your dreams, no matter what they are? Although I agree with the latter, there are plenty of arguments for both sides, all of which are presented in this movie. \r\n\r\nAt its core, Good Will Hunting is a two-sided character study, half about Damon's character and half about Williams's. The scenes in which these two personalities clash are the best in the movie. Right from the beginning, you know this won't be your ordinary drama: Damon wrecks Williams within the first five minutes of therapy, and Williams retaliates the next day with a complete debasing of Damon's cocky indifference to the world around him. I love it when two characters in a movie see the world in completely different ways, and these two personify that 110%. Their dialogue is sharply written, funny, and heartfelt. I didn't cry (as usual), but I did find myself biting my lip at the end.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Good Will Hunting: 9/10 stars. This is one of the greats, and should be recognized as such-- it was robbed of Best Picture by Titanic, of all things (although LA Confidential is a bit better). The characters are well-defined, the drama is impeccably acted, and although it verges a little to close to cloying sentimentality, it always knows when to pull back with some biting humor and great one-liners. A must-see.",

            "content": "The Well Executed Performance of Good Will Hunting \n\tLawrence Bender's film, Good Will Hunting, depicts a story of a troubled young adult, Will, as he develops from a former foster kid into a recognized genius with the capabilities to master some of mathematics' toughest equations. Under the care of MIT's Professor Lambeau, Will is assigned to work on mathematical equations with the extra burden of going to therapy once a week, all in order to stay out of trouble. His therapist, Sean Maguire proceeds to challenge Will throughout the movie as Sean proposes ideas pertaining to life lessons and experiences. Not only does Sean Maguire challenge Will, Will also challenges Sean. This adds a certain depth to the phenomenally organized plot executed with the extraordinary performances from the emotional, genuine actors being: Matt Damon (Will), Robin Williams (Sean), and Minnie Driver (Skylar). The actors give believable performances with a script so cleverly written that it covers realms of humor, deep emotion, physical and mental pain, and moments of light-heartedness, that leaves the audience intrigued with memorable moments and quotes. \n\tMatt Damon portrays Will in a convincing and authentic way. He fully captures emotional scenes such as one with Minnie in which his facial expressions, physicality, and anger are mesmerizing, as they reflect Will's memories of his horrible and haunting past. In addition, he masters the light humorous scenes, such as when he jokes around with the prestigious therapists, convincing them he is insane. Minnie Driver also provides a refreshing take on the \"smart girl\" character as she provides a humorous performance and genuine emotion when she experiences heartache. She shows this through her mannerisms, such as wanting physical touch, when she wants to be loved. Moreover, Robin Williams presents a vulnerability masked by professionalism; yet the look in his eyes, the facial expressions, and the placement of his hands depicts his character's emotional pain in a hidden way. \nEven more so, the chemistry between Robin Williams and Matt Damon is the epitome of great acting, which adds flair and memorability to the plot. They make the humorous scenes funny, yet nothing too extreme to overshadow the dramatic elements of the movie, and the emotional connection they have for each other is extremely touching and authentic. This is shown when the strong and supportive Robin Williams holds the trembling, sobbing Matt Damon like a son as Sean reassures Will that nothing was his fault. They also depict scenes of anger due to pain well, without holding back on emotional/vulgar language and violent actions. Each scene is believable and is never forced, due to these characters' impeccable ability to let emotion overtake them. \n\tThe strength of the acting performance only enhances the engaging script. The script is well organized with an original story line that takes its own refreshing spin on the bad boy turned good story that is truly captivating. With the development of each character, the backstory, the memorable quotes such as \"bad times, will wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to,\" and the depth to each character's background and emotional state are reasons why Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve high praise as the writers.",

It's one of those movies that you just need to have watched some time in your life or you'd be a fool. Missing this movie is like missing a huge part of the film-making culture of Cinema and the 90's in general.\n\nThis is also the movie where Ben Affleck & Matt Damon really make their mark and jump on the A-list scene of actors and writers, granted Damon more as an actor and Affleck more as a writer. \n\nStorywise, the movie may be predictable, but somehow not in a bad way. Yes, you kind of know the ending from the first 10 minutes, but I believe that's how it was intended to be. Actually it's the key message of the film, that the end is not important, but instead the journey. It's not so much the general story arc that is interesting in this film but instead the interactions between the deeply developed characters and their relationships.\n\nDirection is excellent from Gus Van Sant, and he had a lot to work with given the excellent acting and greatly written story. Music and production quality are good but not incredible, given this is meant to be a down to earth story-driven film.\n\nActing performances are incredible from the entire cast, although one would need to be insane not to specifically mention Matt Damon in lead and Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver in supporting roles. Williams and Damon put forward Oscar worthy roles and have some performances that are incredibly emotional. Their chemistry as well as the matchup of Damon - Driver and Skarsgard - Williams are something to pay close attention to while watching.\n\nAll in all, How do ya like dem apples? Quite a bit!

Good Will Hunting's story felt fresh and I loved that about this movie, nowadays you rarely get movies like Good Will Hunting, movies with a well thought our story and characters that you actually care about. I thought that Damon and Affleck did a great job at balancing out the tone of the film because there is a mix of drama and comedy, mainly drama but there is sill a good amount of humor. Another thing I love about this movie is that it has heart, you actually care about what is happening on screen and about the characters in the film. The dialogue in this film is just brilliantly written because it feels so real; when you hear these four friends speak it feels real, when two or more characters are having this deep and dramatic conversation it feels real. Everything in this script is just amazing in my eyes; the story is great, the drama is hard-hitting, the humor works, the dialogue is brilliant, and the characters were well thought out. The only complaint I have is very minor and that is a little pacing issue at some point of the film, which could be the directors fault, but other than that everything was marvelous. Director Gus Van Sant does an astonishing job directing Damon's and Affleck's script, he does a very good job at setting up the shots and adding some intensity to the heavy scenes along with directing the actors. Cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier does a spectacular job at capturing the look of the movie and Danny Elfman's score was pure brilliance and fit the film perfectly. The performances in this movie are just extraordinary, there is not one weak link in this cast. This is the movie that put Matt Damon on the map and he gives one of the best performances of his career in this one. He just becomes this character because he knows the character since he wrote him and his chemistry with all the other actors are flawless. Robin Williams gives a fantastic performance and deserved the win that year for Best Supporting Actor, he gives such a powerful performance and every time he and Damon are on screen it's just magic. The rest of the supporting cast is also great which includes Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsgard, Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser. In the end Good Will Hunting is a terrific film and is filmmaking at it's best, definitely check this one out if you haven't already seen it.",

Whenever a new blockbuster movie comes out, the creators think it is absolutely necessary to add in some humor, when it is not really needed. This is what's primarily wrong with Iron Man 3.

It's funny how 18 years can change your opinion about a movie. I was lukewarm to the film back then, but now - 18 years wiser - I see it in a new light.\n\nI had initially dismissed this film as a two hour study of a bunch of unlikeable and unbelievable people. But now it is evident that Matt Damon deserved his Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the title character, the good Will Hunting.\n\nDamon does a yeoman's job making us believe in someone who is not only a math genius with a photographic memory, but a barroom-brawler, cynic, janitor, lover, and all-around down-to-earth working-class joe. Damon and his compadre Ben Affleck also deserved their Oscar screenplay win for creating a character more fantastic than any from the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nRobin Williams also deserved his Oscar win for having us buy his interpretation of an all-knowing beard-sporting eye-glinting joke-cracking-but-no-nonsense psychologist. \n\nAffleck, director Gus Van Sant, and the rest of the cast merit mention as well for trying to get us to like and accept all the unappealing and implausible characters who populate this fantasy world.\n\nAll this leads me to believe that I should revisit films like Showgirls, The River Wild, Devine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, and The Greek Tycoon. Maybe I was a little too harsh in my initial assessment of those as well. \n\nYeah, right.",

Some of the best scenes are no cut monologues in which the actors give some of the most outstanding performances I've ever seen. Will Hunting is a talented but troubled character who needs to get on his feet, not only for himself, but for the sake of his burnt out friends and desperate professor. He is constantly fighting himself and others because of the decisions he is forced to make, allowing the audience to feel his pain with every word. There is a realness to Damon's chemistry with Williams, Driver, and Affleck that cannot be forced or practiced, and this is probably some of the best work done by any of these actors.",

Not stunning in the superficial sense, but a picture that really questions ones current situation and meaning in this world. I recently watched this movie and was concerned that I wasn't going to enjoy the move because of preconceived notions I had about the movie, knowing that it is widely and critically claimed - both for its acting and resonating message. I was wrong and this movie totally blew me away.\r\n\r\nWill Hunting (played by Matt Damon in his Oscar-nominated role) is an extremely bright Maths genius at one of the world's most prestigious universities - no, not as a student - as one of its janitors and whose situation is not and its most ideal in life. Plagued by deep personal problems, Hunting is forced to confide in therapy to aid his plight by the highly acclaimed Professor of Psychology Sean Maguire (portrayed by Robin Williams in his Academy Award-winning performance for this picture). Although initially apprehensive about confiding in a profession Hunting fails to appreciate - big earners - the two's friendship blossoms into the very message this picture is trying to encourage - follow your dreams but never forget who your friends are. \r\n\r\nThe film's writing is also of genius - striking a comedic and dramatic balance in what is meant to be a deeply touching picture. Those in the supporting roles of the movie (Affleck, Driver and Williams) were also positive highlights in demonstrating how varied our lives can be in terms of who we are acquainted with. We all know someone like Will Hunting - a bright guy whose direction in life is way of course, someone like Chuckie whose persistent irritancies aims to encourage us to fulfill our life to the fullest and of course Driver's character - a crush that decides to move away forever. Damon and Affleck penned this magnificent piece of art won, to date, their only Academy Award - for Best Original Screenplay - is a thoroughly decide accolade that will stand the test of time to be forgotten. \r\n\r\nWords cannot bespeak the brilliance of this movie, currently ranked as one of my favorites of all time. The true success with this movie is how relatable the plot is to our lives and how Hunting's story of pain and happiness can help us to aspire to be more than just money-grabbing robots.",

            "content": "One of the most important things a person should know is that everyone is different and we all have our own life story. Sometimes, a person with certain skills and talents comes from the last place we think we'd find them. In the case of the main title character in Gus Van Sant's 1997 drama Good Will Hunting, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a gifted mathematician even though he's only a janitor at MIT. Although a mathematics teacher (Stellan Skarsgard) on campus recognizes his impressive skills, Will doesn't seem to be interested in pursuing a future as a student and would rather hang out with his pals (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser) instead. \n\nThis all changes however when he gets into a fight with someone who bullied him as a kid and faces the possibility of going to jail as a result of his actions. When the teacher gets wind of this incident, he offers to bail Will out under two conditions: 1) he studies mathematics under his supervision, and 2) he sees a therapist regularly. Although Will agrees to this deal, he isn't thrilled with the idea of seeing a therapist and doesn't take his first few therapists seriously. \n\nBut when the teacher is able to hire his former college roommate (Robin Williams) to give a shot at getting through to Will, Will eventually starts to open up about his past and his current relationship with a British student (Minnie Driver) at MIT. Through their therapy sessions, they start to learn more about one another and realize that they both share important things in common. \n\nGood Will Hunting is an inspiring, if not particularly surprising, tale about learning to plan for the road ahead and figuring out where you want to go in life with committed performances from the entire cast, and a script by co-stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck with a handful of enjoyable moments. Good Will Hunting is also a well crafted character study about a young man who has the potential as proved through his math skills, but just doesn't have the direction towards where he wants to go in life. In a way, all the people that Will comes across are all there to help him. Between his girlfriend, his friends, the therapist and the teacher, they all shape him in more ways than one. \n\nThe first two-thirds of the film are very well done and naturally play out with the chemistry between Damon and Driver as well as the relationships Damon has with everybody. Then comes the last third of the movie which relies too heavily on the formula most other movies follow, with the love interest possibly leaving town and the main character experiencing some sort of downfall in which everyone in the audience then knows what will happen next and how everything will be resolved in the end. \n\nI've always disliked it when a film resorts to very clich\u00e9d plot devices like this since it takes away the natural authenticity the film had before that point, and since it feels too safe to the point where even the slightest bit of creativity is discouraged due to an excessive fear of failure on the filmmaker's part. In particular, it doesn't work in the last third of this movie, since they don't give us a good enough reason why these events need to happen in the first place, it just feels really forced and heavy-handed. \n\nOther than that \"normal\" plot flaw with the film's last third and a few brief slow spots, I liked what Good Will Hunting had to offer. I thought its message regarding the importance of figuring out your life goals and dreams is a good moral to reinforce to teenagers and young adults. Although there is a generous amount of profanity in the film, the dialogue and the situations the characters undergo were well thought through by writers/stars Damon and Affleck. \n\nEven despite its predictability, the story that was being told had a certain originality to it and the characters were fairly engaging enough to make the drama in the story stimulating. As long as you don't expect too many surprises, with the exception of one or two, there's enough substance in Good Will Hunting that makes it worth checking out.",

I highly recommend this movie. Here you have a 90s classic wich is simple but powerful. This movie defines many things with its dialogue and not only and that's why I loved it. Sow, what I can tell about Good Will Hunting is that is a masterpiece with a masterpiece title, the acting was superb, so as the writing, the soundtrack and the directing, this is a kind of movie that we don't get to see every day, and when we get to see it, we can't lose that oppurtinity, because this is pure cinema. You haven't watched Good Will Hunting because you thought it sucked? Go hunt good will. Overall, Good Will Hunting is a tremendous film, I'm glad it had amazing reviews and I'm glad it  has an 8.1 on IMDb and it's on IMDb's Top 250 List on #179, I'm also glad it won 2 Oscars and it was nominated for some other oscars. Good Will Hunting is without doubts a must see and one of my favorite movies. Fantastic movie.\n\nGus Van Sant directed it and he did a pretty good job and I think he deserved his Oscar-nomination for his great work. Matt Damon was fantastic, he was like 17 years old and he was just terrific and although he didn't won his Oscar, I think he deserved to get his nomination by his amazing work playing a troubled kid, Matt is known from The Departed, The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, True Grit, The Adjustment Bureau and some other movies. Robin Williams was terrific, he was just excellent and I completely loved his performance as a guy who knows lots of things and every time he opens his mouth he says something true and amazing, I think he was just excellent and I have no second thoughts about him getting an oscar for this marvelous performance, wich was probably the best performance of his whole career, Robin is known from Mrs. Doubtfire, Aladdin and some other movies. Ben Affleck was great here, I liked his performance alot, Ben is known from The Town, Pearl Harbor, Daredevil and some other movies. Stelan Skarsg\u00e5rd was okay, I liked his performance, Stellan is known from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Thor, Mamma Mia! and some other movies. Minnie Driver was great  here, she joined the movie a solid performance that was worth of a deserved Oscar-nomination, Minnie is known from Grosse Point Blank, Tarzan, Barney's Version, Motherhood and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a fantastic cast and fantastic performances, but the one thing that really stands out is Robin's and Matt's fantastic chemistry. Fantastic cast.\n\nWill Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor that works at MIT. He seems to have a gift to solve mathematic problems, but now he has to see the psyhcologist Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) to find a direction in his life. But, what is really going to give him a better direction in his life is Skylar (Minnie Driver), his soul mate. Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them.(What I thought about the plot) The script was pure genius, it was amazingly written by Matt and Ben and they both deserved their Oscar, because this script is just genius, it's clever and heartwarming. They created many fantastic characters, like Will Hunting (Matt), a young jenitor that turns out to be a Math genius. I also loved the Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), it was a very interesting character about a middle-aged guy who has a troubled past but he's now going to find his new direction. Sow, I loved the characters and I loved the plot, the plot was amazingly written and I think it couldn't get away without getting an Oscar. Fantastic plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, the soundtrack was great. The soundtrack was composed by Danny Elfman and he did a great job, he composed very well a dramatic score wich was worth of an Oscar-nomination. The original song by Elliot Smith, \"Miss Misery\", also gave this movie another Oscar-nomination. Sow, as you can see, 2 of this movie's Oscar-nominations were for its soundtrack, wich means that this movie has an amazing soundtrack.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, I think this should be watched by everyone, Good Will Hunting is an extraordinary movie with a great mix of drama and humor, mostly because of Robin. Overall, Good Will Hunting has found its good will right at the beginning of it, it's a movie that leaves you happy, makes you rarely laugh, but everytime rare time you laugh is great and it's a very well made movie about finding yourself, it has a fantastic cast, fantastic performances, a fantastic plot, a fantastic storyline, it's highly entertaining and I highly recommend it. This movie will always be a memorable classic that's not just a movie, it's much more than that. Highlight: Matt next to Robin; Plot, etc. Worst: Nothing. Sow, watch Good Will Hunting if you haven't, you'll be entertained you'll have your heart warmed mostly by the actors on the screen. Good Will Hunting: 10/10. Terrific.\n\nTerrific movie. Extremely recommended movie, 100% recommended movie. Grade: A+.",

Following a script co-written by its then-budding star duo Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, the story introduces Will Hunting (Damon) as a troubled math prodigy who, after a few too many run-ins with the law, cuts a deal with an MIT professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) that involves him seeing a therapist, an idea Will rejects until he meets Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), a former colleague of Lambeau's who has a few skeletons in his own closet. The script on its own is emotionally resonant, but what catapults this movie even higher are the performances. Both Damon and Affleck are solid, and Minnie Driver is also effective as Will's love interest. That being said, as is the case with most movies he's cast in, this ends up being the Robin Williams show, but for an entirely different reason. He trades in his manic comedy persona for a subdued, intense performance as a down-and-out former wunderkid that stands the test of time. It also rightly won him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. A satisfying drama on all counts - see it.",

        {
            "content": "I'm going to start off saying, 1998 will forever be the year that Good Will Hunting got robbed from its academy award by Titanic, after watching this film again it just further reminded me of it.  While the story arc can at times seem a little predictable it does it so dang well and the script deals with the story so well that even though this kind of inspirational arc has been done before it never strays from being engaging and brilliant.  \n\nGood Will Hunting follows Will Hunting (as played by Matt Damon) who is a janitor at MIT as well as working a construction job, the kid has an extreme gift for learning and academics that he is seen to be a wasted potential.  After getting into a fight and almost having to serve time Prof. Lambeau bails him out, after discovering he solved one of his theorems, on the condition that he does math for him and take therapy.  Although Matt Damon is very reluctant (for most the movie) about the therapy given by Sean Maguire (played brilliantly by Robin Williams) he goes through with it, if only to avoid being put back in jail.  By just giving the general gist of the storyline it seems like a fairly predictable inspirational story, and in some ways you could see it like that, but then you would be missing so much of the brilliance of it.  The movie (penned brilliantly by Damon and Affleck) takes a very simple story and premise and creates so many fantastic moments and scenes that all play out so well (it also helps that every actor in the movie gives a spot-on performance, especially in Damon and Williams' case, the two of them were extraordinarily moving in their scenes together and worked very well off of each other).  Honestly, I do not think you can watch Good Will Hunting and not have the script and performances make you feel something, they are just that well done.\n\nAnother thing in Good Will Hunting's favor is that it is a two hour long movie and it keeps you engaged for the entire two hours.  This is a spectacular feat in that most movies that are over 2 hours in length have a hard time keeping you engaged for the entire two hours (or longer), they almost always have a part where you may lose focus or drift off for a second, Good Will Hunting never has that moment where it loses your attention, once it grabs it your attention belongs to the film until the credits start rolling.  I have to think that the only explanation for how it is able to accomplish this is that every element of the film works and keeps you engaged, the direction is great, the screenplay fantastic, the performances are phenomenal, the ensemble and chemistry is also so good you can't really point out a weak link where you are like, \"That's the guy, that's the one thing that's wrong with the movie.\"  That is because unlike a lot of movies, every character has their purpose, all the characters are well developed, even the minor ones, and all the actors play their roles (even the minor ones) to the standard as if they were the lead of the film, there is no actor who slacks off and gives a lousy performance.  And again, this is most likely due to the fact because everything else worked and so the acting fell into place as well.\n\nOn a more technical note, the soundtrack does a very good job at keeping the mood of the film, sure it's not the most groundbreaking soundtrack ever, but it does its purpose and it does its purpose well.  The cinematography is also done well, and yes there isn't anything groundbreaking but there isn't many groundbreaking shots you can take with a film like this, however there are many nice pictures made and it is also done well that there can't be a complaint about it.\n\nI will give my one small gripe about this film however, and it is very (very) nit-picky, it is that I would have ended the film at *SPOILER* the character Affleck plays (Chuckie) leaving to find that Damon had left and Robin Williams picking up the letter.  I honestly didn't need to hear the letter, it should have left it ambiguous and even ending with the same car driving except with a cut on what the actual letter said (Robin Williams could have even said, \"He stole my line\", out loud after reading it).  I think leaving a little ambiguity would have made the ending more interesting where the viewer can pretty much assume where Damon is going to go but it isn't told to them, just one more little piece for the viewer to link themselves is good, it makes it more interesting.  But again, that was very nit-picky and isn't really a flaw in the movie.\n\nOverall, Good Will Hunting is another classic that the 90s produced that sadly got overshadowed by the good but less deserving Titanic (similarly how Shawshank and Pulp got overshadowed by Forrest Gump, although I like Gump a lot better than Titanic (although it didn't deserve the oscar over shawshank or Pulp Fiction) and Pulp and Shawshank have larger followings than Good Will Hunting has today).  Bolstered by powerful performances by Damon and Williams as well as a moving script and excellent direction, Good Will Hunting is a rare film that gets everything right, and one of my personal favorites that came from the 90s era.  10/10 for Good Will Hunting.",

The message here is that you should leave the group that supports you the most because they really want you to be the best nihilist you can be, then join the system against your better judgment, because you really want to do that cute co-ed sporting a thick british accent and almost as \"real\" a personality as yours.

Some of his, improvised nonetheless, scenes are breathtakingly believable and heartfelt. \n\nAt a budget of $10 million however, Good Will Hunting was never quite the visual tour de force. Especially in light of more contemporary films that showcased the Ivy League schools as set pieces, Good Will Hunting falls somewhat flat. It has to be stated however that this does not compromise the integrity of the movie in any way whatsoever. \n\nGood Will Huntings fifteenth anniversary fast approaching make a fitting excuse to revisit, in my opinion, one of the many highlights that is late 90's cinema.",

I love how Ben and Matt write such a brotherly relationship between all of the friends, ironically primarily in the case of Ben and Casey who use their relationship as brothers in real life to propel the characters and help the viewer understand who they are in the group and what they mean to the story. Matt Damon's amazing star-making performance. Better than his other performances in some of his other truly amazing films even the likes of \"The Bourne Identity\" and \"The Departed.\" I always love it when actors get to use their true accents in their films.
