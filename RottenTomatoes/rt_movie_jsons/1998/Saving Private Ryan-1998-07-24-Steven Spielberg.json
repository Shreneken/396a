I knew that the story was about world war 2 so I wasn't very much excited to watch it at first, it is why I gave it an okay rating. It was usual world war 2 stuff at the beginning, was pretty boring, and didn't have anything interesting. But as the story continued, I started to pay more attention to it, and it actually was good halfway through, until it finished with a very excellent ending. Overall, an okay movie that I would have given it more if I was liking it from the beginning.",

            "content": "Saving Private Ryan is a cinematic masterpiece that immerses its audience in the brutal and visceral reality of World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film follows a group of soldiers as they search for a paratrooper, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last surviving brother of four soldiers killed in action.\n\nFrom the opening scene, Spielberg's masterful direction pulls viewers into the chaos and horror of the D-Day invasion. The intense and realistic depiction of the beach landing is one of the most unforgettable moments in cinematic history. The sound design is outstanding, with the roar of gunfire, explosions, and the screams of wounded soldiers all adding to the sense of dread and danger.\n\nThe performances in Saving Private Ryan are nothing short of incredible. Tom Hanks delivers a nuanced and emotional portrayal of Captain John Miller, the leader of the search party. The rest of the cast, including Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, and Barry Pepper, all deliver exceptional performances as well. But it's Matt Damon's portrayal of Private James Ryan that really stands out, with his haunting monologue at the film's climax leaving a lasting impact on the audience.\n\nWhat makes Saving Private Ryan such a remarkable film is its unflinching portrayal of war. The violence is brutal and unrelenting, and Spielberg doesn't shy away from showing the physical and emotional toll it takes on soldiers. Yet despite the horrors of war, the film also manages to find moments of beauty and humanity, reminding us of the sacrifices made by those who fought for our freedom.\n\nOverall, Saving Private Ryan is a cinematic tour de force that showcases Spielberg's mastery of the craft. The film is an emotional and unforgettable tribute to the brave soldiers who fought and died in World War II, and it remains a timeless classic that should be viewed by all.",

This film portrays the war much more realistically, which also means it's incredibly violent and disturbing, especially at the beginning. The characters feel real, as does the emotion. While not suitable for some, this movie can, while fictional, really help us understand some of the horrors of war, but also that we're all humans. Saving Private Ryan showed us that German doesn't always equal Nazi. That you shouldn't kill someone just because they're wearing the uniform. It taught us to see the human in others.",

The sheer grittiness and realism with which this film presents itself with a plot which is so emotionally driven it could literally make you want to stand up and salute your soldiers and a score so riveting that gives you absolute goosebumps every time you listen to it, you know you're going in for a cinematic masterpiece.\n\nfirst of all, this film, truly, in every sense is what depicts warfare in it's most real and raw form. the violence is so real and so hard-hitting, I literally had horrors while seeing it and had to pause a couple times during some scenes. Props to the director Steven Spielberg for pushing through all that criticism of graphic depiction and choosing to show us exactly how much a war actually destroys in both, the physical and the spiritual form.\n\nnow, the story is this film's strongest point. a heartfelt story like this set in the backdrop of the second world war just hits you right in the gut with a powerful punch and the emotional catharsis it provides to the characters (and the viewers too) at the end make it one of the greatest written endings I've seen.\n\nthe acting is yet another strong branch of the film without which I think this film would've totally tanked. Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper all of them are so good, they make you believe that they're actual war veterans. hell! even vin diesel gives off a decent performance here! (that should definitely say something right?)\n\nif you want to experience what cinema was truly made for, watch this film. this is not just a war film filled with military propaganda but so much more.",

            "content": "\"Saving Private Ryan\" is a 1998 war/action movie directed by Steven Spielberg, and starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, and Tom Sizemore. The film follows a group of soldiers during the Normandy invasion of World War II, as they search for a paratrooper named Private James Ryan who is the last surviving brother of four soldiers.\n\nOne of the strongest elements of \"Saving Private Ryan\" is its depiction of the horrors of war. The film's opening sequence is a tour de force, showing the brutal and chaotic nature of the Normandy invasion with a visceral and unflinching approach. The rest of the film does not shy away from the physical and emotional toll that war takes on soldiers, and the acting by the ensemble cast is exceptional, especially Tom Hanks as Captain John Miller.\n\nThe film also features stunning cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, with a desaturated color palette that adds to the film's sense of gritty realism. The use of handheld cameras and quick cuts in the battle scenes also adds to the film's intensity and immediacy.\n\nSteven Spielberg's direction is masterful, skillfully balancing the action and emotion of the film, and creating a sense of tension and urgency throughout. The musical score by John Williams is also excellent, with haunting melodies that capture the film's somber tone.\n\nOne potential criticism of the film is its sentimentality. While the film is undoubtedly powerful and moving, some viewers may find the emotional moments to be manipulative or overly melodramatic.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Saving Private Ryan\" is a powerful and visceral war/action movie that is a testament to the sacrifices made by soldiers in World War II. Its exceptional acting, cinematography, and direction make it a classic of the genre, despite some potential criticism of its emotional manipulation. It is a must-watch for any fan of war movies.",

I don't have the opinion you have to be original in order to be good but when you're going so incredibly slow and drawing out battles longer than you should it's hard not to feel that way. The movie isn't all bad as the first 30 minutes are very great and detailed showing how chaotic the front was. The characters are very intriguing when put in different scenarios but most of the time they are either sitting around or are in excruciatingly long battles that don't progress the film and makes it feel like you're just waiting for the end of each battle except the first one. Tom hanks was great as he always is but the film suffers from bad pacing and for being really unoriginal.",

Edward Burns and Barry Pepper were my two faves in support but so many recognizable faces popped up in this eclectic cast, with no discernible weak spots.\n\nThe battle scenes that bookend this film are some of the most intensely captivating and engagingly authentic images of WWII I can recall seeing in a film. These scenes never feel like they are being given an artistic flourish, rightfully so, and are seemingly shot with a total lack of emotion or commentary on the part of the filmmaker, adding to the raw impact felt through many of them.\n\nI am not sure which film will now supplant this at the top of that aforementioned list but I'm pretty sure it won't live up to the hype as well as this did... 9.5/10",

ALL of the actors in this brilliant movie did and amazing job, but the one that stood up for me was Tom Hank's with such a good performance. The plot was a little bit stretched for me, but itself, the plot was great.\nanother thing I gotta praise is the director, other than THE Steven Spielberg. on the paper, the movie is five stars, but I think there were a lot of unnecessary scenes that just made the movie way longer then it should have been. I think that the movie would have been able to sum up in two hours and the extra fifty minutes of scenes just made it a little bit discouraging. But it's still one of the best war movies ever. If you like the genre or just want to see a quality movie, I would higely recommand on \"Saving Private Ryan\"",

            "content": "One of the most powerful film experiences I've ever had. Steven Spielberg's sobering, emotional, and patriotic WWII film redefined what a war film should be. No romanticizing, no heroics, no good guys or bad guys. What shines through is a kind of humanity rarely witnessed on film. The opening 24-minute D-Day invasion is the most astonishing, ambitious, and meticulously researched and detailed battle sequence ever committed to celluloid. Nothing has ever matched its scope and chaotic grisliness. It perfectly captures the randomness, harrowing devastation, and inhumanity of war. The film isn't just an absorbing story about a rescue mission, it's also a philisophical film about the pointlessness of war. Janus Kaminsky's Oscar-winning cinematography brings a documentary-real look to the events, with bleached-out film stock and gritty, nervy hand-held cameras recreating the look of old newsreel footage of WWII. The acting is superb across the board, with not a single bad performance to be found. Tom Hanks brings down his charisma to play an everyday man caught up in this bloody campaign, who must remain a stoic and strong leader for his men. It still baffles me how this lost the Best Picture Oscar to 'Shakespeare in Love.' Remember that film? No, not many people do. But this is a moving and honorable testament to those men who gave everything in that war, the lives they helped saved, and to Spielberg's legacy as one of the best filmmakers in history. This is the best war film I've ever seen, and one of the greatest American films ever made",

Tom Hanks is always fantastic and I think the moment you feel for him is in the moment where they are pinned down on the beach. The supporting cast helps in the first act really establish ground and with actors like Vin Diesel playing off Edward Burns and Jeremy Davies shines in the role. The moments where Hanks interacts with Davies are also great but help Adam Goldberg as well. Finally running into Matt Damon really delivers and helps bring it home with Hanks right on the bridge. Overall 9.5/10.",

I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room. It was like watching Frankenstein's monster tearing out Elizabeth's heart.\n\n8.5/10 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre war-film, that is a little slow at times.

I'm talking, of course, about the Omaha beach landings, not the cold opening of a veteran visiting a grave (I don't want to give anything away there). It remains one of the most astonishing pieces of film making ever put to screen, and what is impressive about the film is that the key battle scenes throughout, shot in the mud and filth of desecrated rural France are every bit as focused. There is a very loose connection between the plot and a real life tale, and if there is a criticism of Saving Private Ryan it is perhaps its opening and closing. It adds an emotional heft that doesn't really need to be there in my opinion. But it's a small quibble, and Saving Private Ryan remains an incredible piece of film making, one that Spielberg backed up in the genre by going on to produce Band Of Brothers (2001) and The Pacific (2010).",

You won't be disappointed.  SPR has long been one of my favorite movies.  Without a doubt the best war movie ever made.  Much has been made about the opening 20 minutes of pure hell where Steve Spielberg subjects the viewer to the horrific experience of those landing on the beaches of Normandy in June 1944, and I would encourage those who are averse to blood or war to put on a brave face and steel yourself through the battle because you will come away with a far greater appreciation of the men who fought so hard to take back what Hitler stole from France and the world.  The high definition realism is terrifying but necessary to understand why the characters quickly become so hardened to their new reality.  The cast is first rate with surprise cameos from familiar names such as Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti, and a youngish Bryan Cranston, but the real awards go to the incredible Tom Hanks and several now familiar stars in their relatively unknown days including Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies, and Edward Burns.  Spielberg hits all the right notes with outstanding battle choreography and effects, pacing that should keep everyone interested, and visual detail and cinematography which leaves you wondering how the beautiful prairies and hillsides of France could have existed so close to the ravages of small villages laid to waste.  I found myself caring for the characters survival as most are well developed and realistic as well as period dialogue as well written as it was read.  SPR isn't without a blunder or two, most notably a scene where the eponymous character played by Matt Damon uncharacteristically balls up and bawls out during the climatic battle, and the final scene was a bit too melodramatic and poorly acted for such an epic movie.  Yet, I remember in 1998 sitting in my theater seat for what seemed like hours (probably 3 or 4 minutes in reality) with a full audience in stunned silence well after the movie ended before finally filing out of what remained a very quiet room - the experience having affected us all.",

Firstly the directing, this has to be Spielberg's best directed film, mostly because of how realistic the film looks ( it was so realistic a veteran in WW11 was a extra quit because of how realistic it was, look it up), and how graphic it also is. The best part of the film has to be the first 30 minutes, it begins with the D-Day invasion in Normandy. Spielberg made a life-size invasion on a beach in Ireland with the troops landing on the beach and the Germans on the hills. What made it better was the film editing which is the best I have ever seen in a film. the sound design as well was terrific and intense. The production design is also very detailed and realistic with all the destroyed buildings and the ruins. the cinimitogerphy is also one of the main aspects of this film because the color was down graded to a duller color. The film is about Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) in the U.S army tasked with a mission to find a Private James Ryan in the 101ts (Matt Damon) somewhere in enemy France to inform him his 3 brothers they were KIA and to bring him home. In the film Miller takes a squad of 8 men to find Ryan. The mission was a succses with 6/8 dead. the film end with a wild and intense final battle (no spoilers). Over all this is one of the best, most original, and detailed films ever made. At the Oscars it won best director but it should have won best picture (winner Shakespear in love).this film is a 10/10.",

It was in my Top 10 was some time.\n\nThat D-Day scene, man did they capture those terror so perfectly. Hearing WWII vets crying over watching that sequence brought to life so realistically is the highest bar for real life-adaptation anyone can achieve.\n\nStill it is hard to believe that Day occured, so many soldiers dieing for the sake of others to reach the other part of the beach, those scenes lives up to the 'Normandy was impossible'\n\nEven after having the world's best war sequence the movie doesn't shy away from other small, yet thrilling action sequences. After that much action we go to the dialogues and they were so great, so much motivational dialogues were written.\n\nSaving Matt Damon, his character saying 'Why me' gave me goosebumps. The other cast were also great, after seeing more 90s stuffs (Friends)- a lot of familiar faces, feels like cameos now.\n\nAfter every battle there were casualties, every death scene was emotional, even in the small runtime those side characters were well written, each different.\n\nSpielberg didn't shy away from 'GoodVsBad', some translation from opposition (Czech) felt heartbreaking. Eye for an Eye theme was explored greatly.\n\nOne of Tom Hanks best performance, English language will run out of adjectives if I say how great he was.\n\nEven to this day, those practical effects holds up, the cinematography & hand held camera for DDay were glorious. Deserves all Oscars.\n\nUpham in that stair not able to help is fellow soldier for 'no kill rule' tears audiences up from inside everytime. Him not having clich\u00e9 hero(arc) moment had great consequences.\n\nIt has become a classic now, one of Hollywood's greatest movie.",

Less of a movie and more of a parable, a reminder of heroism and an experience and an exercise in empathy for a new generation when it came out and today. \n\nWhat struck me immediately with the 4K transfer, besides the vivid colours of fire and blood, and those incredible and soulful close-ups, is how the documentary style of the film is still often so present and immediate and fresh. It revivifies the themes and the meaning of the film all over again and a perfect promotion for what upgrading the quality of films can do for them. This too happened with Apocalypse, Now: Final Cut. \n\nSaving Private Ryan is a film constructed to say so much with so little, the characters of the film follow the same rule, effortlessly watchable with no one painted with broad strokes and left, like comrades, with their depth and uniqueness just bubbling beneath the surface. The aural soundscape is second to none, overwhelmingly impressive and immersive. \n\nThere's nothing sadistic about this film and yet it is brutal and pulls no punches. It's a warm hearted warning about war and a subtle and unstuffy character study about men at war.",

The film looked extremely realistic from start to finish. The action sequences were engaging and were also a graphic yet realistic depiction of war. The film also has amazing performances by Matt Damon, Tom Seizemore and Tom Hanks. The sound effects were amazing and really did make you feel as if you were in the battlefield. The camera work and cinematography was very well done. The different shots that were utilised were utilised effectively in order to capture the chaos of war. The practical effects in the film was very well done. The only thing I wish this film did was to put german translations when they would say something when in combat. Worth 100%.",

The scene then shifts to the morning of June 6, 1944, as American soldiers land on Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy Invasion. They suffer heavy losses in assaulting fortified German defensive positions. Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) of the 2nd Ranger Battalion leads a breakout from the beach. Elsewhere on the beach, a dead soldier lies face-down in the bloody surf; his pack is stenciled Ryan, S. In Washington, D.C., at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall learns that three of the four sons of the Ryan family were killed in action and that the fourth son, Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), is with the 101st Airborne Division somewhere in Normandy. After reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter aloud, Marshall orders Ryan brought home. Three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back. He chooses seven men from his company. Sergeant Mike Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Richard Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Adrian Caparzo (Vin Diesel), Private Stanley Mellish (Adam Goldberg), Private Daniel Jackson (Barry Pepper), Medic Irwin Wade (Giovanni Ribisi) and Corporal Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies), an interpreter from headquarters...\n\nSaving Private Ryan received acclaim from critics and audiences; much of the praise went for Spielberg's directing, the realistic battle scenes, the actors' performances, John Williams' score, the cinematography, editing, and screenplay. Rotten Tomatoes  The consensus states \"Anchored by another winning performance from Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic war film virtually redefines the genre. Many critics associations, such as New York Film Critics Circle and Los Angeles Film Critics Association, chose Saving Private Ryan as Film of the Year. Roger Ebert gave it four stars out of four and called it \"a powerful experience\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it \"the finest war movie of our time\". Gene Siskel, Ebert's co-host and critic of Chicago Tribune, said that the film \"accomplishes something I had been taught was most difficult\u2014making an action-filled anti-war film or, at least, one that doesn't in some way glorify or lie about combat\". Writing for TIME, Richard Schickel said that was \"a war film that, entirely aware of its genre's conventions, transcends them as it transcends the simplistic moralities that inform its predecessors, to take the high, morally haunting ground\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film, saying that \"Spielberg has captured the hair-trigger instability of modern combat.\" Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times praised the film as well, calling it \"a powerful and impressive milestone in the realistic depiction of combat, Saving Private Ryan is as much an experience we live through as a film we watch on screen.\"\n\nMany World War II veterans stated that the film was the most realistic depiction of combat they had ever seen. The film was so realistic that some combat veterans of D-Day and Vietnam left theaters rather than finish watching the opening scene depicting the Normandy invasion. Their visits to posttraumatic stress disorder counselors rose in number after the film's release, and many counselors advised \"'more psychologically vulnerable'\" veterans to avoid watching it.\n\nReleased on July 24, 1998, Saving Private Ryan received acclaim from critics and audiences for its performances, particularly from Hanks, realism, cinematography, score, screenplay, and Spielberg's directing. It was also a box office success. At the 71st Academy Awards, the film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hanks and Best Original Screenplay; it went on to win five for Spielberg's second win for Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects Editing, though the film lost Best Picture to Shakespeare in Love in a controversial upset. The film also won both the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and the Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture, while Spielberg won Golden Globe and Directors Guild of America Award for Best Director. Since its release, Saving Private Ryan has been considered as one of the greatest films ever made and has been lauded as influential on the war film genre. Steven Spielberg\u00b4s WWII epic drama is such an emotional and moving piece of film showing the horrors of war, the casualties, the survivors, the courage, the trauma, the sorrow and the comradery. It\u00b4s a fine piece of film that manages to move me to tears every time I see it.  And I think it\u00b4s important to show how horrifying war is and I also think that it\u00b4s good that we show our deepest gratitude for those who gave their lives in WWII to free Europe. Wonderful performances from all the actors (Tom Hanks is magnificent) in the leading roles and it is so well made particularly in the battle scenes and sequences. \"Saving Private Ryan\" is by far one of Spielberg\u00b4s best films and one of the best WWII war movies ever made in my opinion.",

            "content": "I wish that this idea had not been attached to Harvey Weinstein of all people but I do think it is true that this film does not manage to live up to it's first twenty minutes as a relatively dull story and a script packed with clich\u00e9s lets down a film with incredible direction and production design. I admire the film in it's execution of battle scenes and it managed to keep me engaged a lot longer than other war epics like The Longest Day (1962) and All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) but it still didn't grab me emotionally and when the film tried to be touching it felt overwrought. Still, it's definitely better than Shakespeare in Love (1998) and I would recommend that people watch it if only for the battle sequence in the opening scenes.\n\nThe plot of the film is relatively simple as after the Normandy Invasion seven men are ordered to find Private James Ryan, Matt Damon, and bring him back to America as his mother has lost her three other sons and General George Marshall pities her. The men are led by school teacher John H. Miller, Tom Hanks, whose hand has begun shaking as his power over his men lessens. Fiery Jewish soldier Stanley Mellish, Adam Goldberg, arrogant Southern sniper Daniel Jackson, Barry Pepper, dissenting New Yorker Richard Reiben, Edward Burns, aggressive ally to Miller, Mike Horvath, Tom Sizemore, and Adrian Caparzo, Vin Diesel, are joined by nervous polyglot Timothy Upham, Jeremy Davies, who has never experienced warfare before. Everybody knows the frustrating twist but it doesn't make it any less annoying when it eventually occurs.\n\nThe immediacy of the scenes of warfare is shocking as we feel that we are immediately inside the mind of one of the poor soldiers who had to take part in the Normandy landings. Spielberg manages to convey the chaos of war while also allowing us to follow various characters, primarily Miller, as they try their hardest to just survive. The scene also works because it is exciting and interesting to watch but it also gets across the horror of war and makes you absolutely terrified of ever having to be involved in a conflict like that. This is a unique achievement because many films that are supposedly about the horrors of war and how it negatively impacts people end up glorifying war and selling young men on the idea that war is a glorious experience. This scene is impressive and few directors could have directed the scene with as much efficiency and focus as Spielberg did.\n\nBeyond this scene however the film began to lose me as we see the traditional bonding scenes that occur in almost every war film between this very different group of men. The character introduction that Upham receives is almost slapstick and the film doesn't go much deeper than that in digging into his psyche as he serves as the comic relief until he has his moment of redemption at the end of the film. Of course Miller gets a big speech that is undoubtedly the reason that Hanks received an Academy Award nomination but it didn't have the panache of Kirk Douglas' speeches in Paths of Glory (1957). None of the individual character moments were particularly memorable and therefore I felt very little connection to the characters and the sight of various men getting shot was something I became desensitized to as I began to realize that in each battle scene we would lose at least one member of the team. This was not what the filmmakers wanted me to feel and I wish that I cared when Miller died but I didn't and as he tells Ryan to \"Earn it\" I was not as moved as I would have been in a film that's even slightly more original.\n\nThis is perhaps the second best film nominated for Best Picture in 1998, I like the much maligned today Life Is Beautiful (1997), and I think that it deserves recognition for the scenes of battle. If I am honest my dislike of war films might have affected my view of the film and if I loved this genre I might be more into it but as it stands I can't find it in myself to love it.",

            "content": "Possibly the most realistic depiction of gruesome war shown in film in Spielberg's yet another addition to his perfect films collection. I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank's character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank's performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it.",

Of note, is the direction, the acting, cinematography, editing, etc.  Tom Hanks as well as others did a magnificent and realistic (for all I know) portrayal of soldiers who had a mission that they didn't agree with.  It's amazing how all the actors aside from Damon did a 10 day boot camp together, leaving Damon to do his on his own because they wanted to keep the animosity between that the soldiers had re losing good men in order to just save Damon.  There are noted historical errors in the film, namely making it seem the Americans did everything on Omaha Beach by themselves when in fact everyone knows the British played a huge role in those events... but aside from these errors/omissions, the crew went out of their way to make it feel as real as possible, and that's commendable.

The film, which runs nearly three hours, is bookended by two major battle scenes. In between, smaller fights alternate with quiet, character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers, allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping. Spielberg, along with writer Robert Rodat and the actors, ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. The action sequences are some of the best ever captured in any genre and the opening Omaha landing sequence which runs almost half an hour is a tour de force of filmmaking.

Then, they go to France in order to save a lost soldier.\n \nThe cast is wonderful, this movie has actors like Tom Hanks as Pvt. Miller, Matt Damon as Ryan. Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns and Vin Diesel. Tom Hanks was the voice of Woody in \"Toy Story\" and appeared in \"Cast Away\". Matt Damon has been in \"Jason Bourne\" or \"The Martian\" . The acting is spectacular, you can feel the fear and the anguish that the characters have in the battles. \n\nA soldier called Ryan lost all his brothers in the war and he got lost. His mother will receive a message about the death of all his sons. Pvt. Miller and a group of soldiers have to save Ryan to have good news for his mom.\n\nI know it's a movie from 1996, but the scenes are so realistic and good that I can't tell the difference with a modern movie. The soundtrack fits very well with a war movie. The fights are so intense, the explosions feel real and the characters are memorable. Knowing that the soldiers that died had a family makes the movie very sad.\n\nIn conclusion, Saving Private Ryan is an amazing movie with emotional moments.\nI'll give the movie a 9/10 because sometimes the camera moves too fast.

            "content": "The first 25 minutes or so is something extraordinary and I don't know how Steven Speilberg pulled it off. The first 25 minutes is basically a war battle but if you really think about it, the amount of technical detail you have to put in it is extremely difficult but it is not just the technical detail that makes the scene amazing but you feel what the men are going through and in some cases make you feel like you are actually in the battle. When Wade dies it is very disturbing and hard to watch but it is also very powerful. The plot of the movie is to bring Ryan back home to saftey because 3 of his brothers have died in combat so a group of soldiers are out looking for him. Tom Hanks gives a incredable performance and I found him once again extremely likable. Tom Sizemore is surprisingly really good and so is Giovanni Ribisi. Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Berry Pepper, and Jeremy Davies are also good and hold their own. This movie is also good at representing it's soldiers more as ordinary people as oppose to a soldier with no flaws and all he thinks about is serving his country. I am not gonna lie, I cried at the end of this movie when Cpt. Miller dies and that is because I grew attached to his character. The character of John Miller is a teacher and just wants to go home and he is forced into a position he does not want to be in. This movie is about characters in a awful situation and seeing how these characters react to war. Many people point out not giving the other countries a huge amount of characterization is a flaw but I personally viewed it as how we view other countries when we are at war and our perspective on them. Great war movie and this is one of Steven Speilbergs best.",

            "content": "It took me 20 years to decide to watch this, due to my general aversion to Tom Hanks alone or in combination with Steven Spielberg (who, as a director, often veers toward heavy-handedness).  However, this war movie is visceral and gripping enough to overcome the inevitable weaknesses associated with its star and auteur director.  So, yes, we are strongly encouraged to endorse Spielberg's view of the \"greatest generation\" as uniquely courageous and noble, overcoming horrific obstacles and bonding together as a team, with John Williams' soundtrack sweeping us along and Hanks' central Captain modelling bravery as a do-no-wrong caring and sympathetic but ordinary guy thrust into an impossible situation.  Maybe the war really was like this for some and I offer all of the veterans my thanks and gratitude.  Fortunately, the film isn't all glorification - we do see moments of fear, cowardice, dissent, and cruelty from the Americans that probably better reflect the width of human experience in this sort of crucible.  However, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum argues that Spielberg hasn't offered anything new that past war movies haven't also shown and perhaps that is true.  But this production added a level of grotesque \"realism\" and \"you are there\" action/violence that might not have been possible before 1998 - it led to Spielberg's subsequent involvement with WWII based video games and you can see the influence (bi-directional, most likely).  The central plot conceit, that Hanks and his small band (of soon-to-be known young actors) must find Private Ryan (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have already been killed in order to send him home to his grieving mama, allows the characters to reflect on the meaningfulness of their actions and adds another dimension to the film, a focus on the guilt and sadness of those who survived.  Although the film doesn't seem to contain any anti-war messages (perhaps because the moral justifications were so strong in that particular war), thinking about the post-traumatic stress of the former combatants (after seeing the visceral and brutal re-enactments here) is enough to ward anyone off from promoting war as a way to resolve differences.  That said, a case could be made for the film as an army recruitment campaign for those who love action, maybe.",

            "content": "A harrowing war story with heartfelt heroes.\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg's war drama epic Saving Private Ryan (1998) remains a moving drama, thrilling war action thriller, and a thoughtful film about morality in times of war. Saving Private Ryan is perhaps Steven Spielberg's most beloved war film ever. He painstakingly recreates D-Day on the beaches of Normandy. It's beautiful and horrifying simultaneously. You're right alongside the soldiers coming off the ships as they desperately run up the beach to capture the German bunker strongholds. It's bloody and brutal with a sense of gritty realism. \n\nI think Spielberg's direction is by far the best aspect of Saving Private Ryan. It's stream lined as you get to follow a company searching for the last son in a larger family that was all killed in World War II. It's a nice story that reels in audiences everywhere. It's about the value of life, love of family, and the unbearable cost of war. WWII truly feels senseless during the sequences of mortar fire, tank battles, and endless crossfire in a furious hail of bullets. It was necessary to stop the Germans, but we witness the devastating consequences of losing infantry among the territories regained. Saving Private Ryan's greatest accomplishment is making you understand the real value of life. It's worth watching as a testament to those who died during WWII. It touches you in ways you'll find hard to describe. Saving Private Ryan is life affirming as Ryan deeply desires to live a fulfilling life to honor his fallen heroes who got him home.\n\nI found the emotional scenes to be sentimental, but deeply felt from Spielberg's incredible cast. It feels genuine through the sincerity with which Tom Hanks plays the squad's leader. Every battle or encounter is followed by scenes of profound grief, regret, hopelessness, and the need for perseverance and purpose. Writer Robert Rodat hits home with his complex views on morality. You see Germans gun down medics and civilians in evil displays of ruthlessness to the aggressive American forces, frustrated with the senseless violence and aggressions of the German soldiers. \n\nEvery moment is a moral choice, not is killing bad, but rather are the lives lost on this mission worth Ryan's alone?. I feel that of course Ryan's life is not worth more than any other soldier risking their life to defeat Germany, but that it is a profound kindness to send home a mother's last son alive after she has just lost three of her other boys. Ryan can only live his life as best he can, but all the men were valiant in the line of duty. Even the coward Upham ends up killing the German that Hanks spared earlier as some men are too evil to let live. I like that Upham is included as everyone thinks they would be brave in combat, but if many of humanity were themselves in a violent situation, they might just be as cowardly as Upham. Saving Private Ryan is about the nuances of courage as Tom Hanks portrays a simple teacher, who bravely answers the call of duty to lead and inspire despite his fears and doubts. You get all kinds of men herein.\n\nTom Hanks is fascinating, cool, moving, and brave as stalwart Captain John H. Miller. You see Hanks making choices and feeling his unthinkable burden. Hanks' speech about remembering the 94 men that died under his command is haunting and sympathetic. Saving Private Ryan is up there with Tom Hanks' best roles and greatest films. He should have won Best Actor in all honesty. Tom Sizemore is fierce and loyal as Technical Sergeant Michael Horvath. Edward Burns is intriguing as the increasingly angry and jaded Private Richard Reiben. Matt Damon is at first arrogant and unlikable Private James Francis Ryan, but he earns his stripes as he valiantly defends the bridge under fire.\n\nBarry Pepper should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor as the skilled and faithful sniper Private Daniel Jackson. His sniping sequences are breathtaking as he prays to God for strength as he rapidly reloads and blows away Nazis with extreme precision. Pepper is gripping like few actors ever get to be on the silver screen. Adam Goldberg is hilarious and devastating as the Jewish soldier Private Stanley Mellish. Goldberg finds the balance of Mellish's rage and sorrow at the horrors the German Nazis have unleased upon his people. Vin Diesel got me pretty upset to see what happens to him just because his character Private Adrian Caparzo wants to save a child. Giovanni Ribisi is haunting as he witnesses brutal wounds and begs for his mother as T-Medic Irwin Wade.\n\nTed Danson has a great cameo as Captain Fred Hamill. Jeremy Davies is fantastic as the well meaning interpreter and cowardly ammo holder Corporal Timothy Upham. The entirety of Saving Private Ryan you can see how Upham was not made for war and fails in his responsibility to protect his fellow allies. Paul Giamatti is funny and serious as the helpful Sergeant William Hill. Nathan Fillion has a funny scene as Minnesota Ryan. Leland Orser is immediately mesmerizing as the worn down Lieutenant DeWindt. Bryan Cranston has a nice cameo as War Department Colonel.\n\nMichael Kahn's editing takes you around a war torn France and all over the battlefield with slick cuts. 169 minutes passes by quickly due to Kahn's fast pace and sterling ability to know when to show a close-up of a character's face for deeper emotional empathy. \n\nCinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski's wide shots for all the battle sequences are glorious like his interesting framing for each man's thinking about his family, values, or losses. I love how up close and personal his shots get with shaking camera work like you're a soldier right beside Spielberg's heroes. All the sets are realistic, booming sounds echo, and gore effects appear real for Saving Private Ryan's stunning technical achievements.\n\nComposer John Williams provides a lovely and eerie score that rises with good intentions and forlorn feelings. Williams' melodies are simply stunning. Even the music is masterful in Saving Private Ryan.\n\nOverall, Saving Private Ryan is still one of the must see war films in cinema history. You'll be stunned at the scope of the D-Day invasion and humbled at Hanks' acting and empathy. Give it a watch.",

            "content": "If there ever was a definitive movie about WWII, this might be it. Saving Private Ryan takes you right into the trenches, literally and figuratively. It gives you the feel of what it\u2019s like to be in combat, and it allows you to ask the same moral questions that soldiers were forced to deal with at that time. I love how intimate this movie allows us to get with the characters, because it had me 100% invested in their struggle. The graphic nature of the violence feels authentic and well-earned, even if it is somewhat easy to foresee when it\u2019s coming. It is a long movie, and there are probably a few areas where it could have been trimmed, but the length makes you feel the unending tension of war and how it can wear on you. I have to admit that I did not enjoy Edward Burns or Adam Goldberg in this film. I can\u2019t say exactly why, but they both rub me the wrong way, and I never felt they blended into the era. Aside from those two, the cast is great and all feel like they fit their role nicely. I have to applaud Saving Private Ryan for a truly powerful framing sequence, and for not making the Oscar-bait decision of going with old-man makeup. That conclusion absolutely rips my heart out and has me bawling with tears. That\u2019s the kind of emotion that Saving Private Ryan can elicit from you. I had seen a number of sequences from this film in the past when it was on TV, but this is the first time I watched the entire thing from beginning to end, and having the full context makes all the difference.",

This film shows you why Steven Spielberg has the career he has because this film was incredible. Even with its flaw, I'm giving this the highest score.\n For more of my movie reviews and updates on blockbuster movie news check out my blog: mtmovieblog.wixsite.com/mtmovieblog",

I am going to say it again.\nDirected by Steven Spielberg who is perhaps more known for his blockbuster family films but every now and then he pulls a film like this out of the hat. \nThe technical abilities demonstrated by this film make it stand out from your average World War II film.\nThe sound effects from the first twenty minutes or so as the Americans land on the beaches of Northern France are amazing. Never mind the visual effects.\nI only watched on a 32\" TV so I can only imagine what it sounded like amplified in a cinema.\nThose first twenty minutes must have cost a fortune  (in filmmaking). The visual effects are quite stunning and really project the firmness of the battle scene.\nI have never been particularly endeared to actor Tom Hanks. I've found him geeky and downright annoying from what I've seen in some of his other films but he fully deserved his Oscar for his performance as a U.S. Rangers Captain.\nA youthful Matt Damon plays Private Ryan who is given the devastating news that his three brothers have been killed in action. Hanks on a mission to return him 'home' to his mother.\nThe film is three hours long but kept me engrossed throughout an achievement that so many 'epics' fail at the first hurdle!\nI just wished I saw this at the cinema back in 1998 at about a time when I saw so many sub-standard films.",

            "content": "An extraordinarily made film that shows us that war is ugly, but through a deep and entertaining story. \n\nSteven Spielberg directed this powerful, realistic re-creation of WWII's D-day invasion and the immediate aftermath. The story opens with a prologue in which a veteran brings his family to the American cemetery at Normandy, and a flashback then joins Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and GIs in a landing craft making the June 6, 1944, approach to Omaha Beach to face devastating German artillery fire. This mass slaughter of American soldiers is depicted in a compelling, unforgettable 24-minute sequence. Miller's men slowly move forward to finally take a concrete pillbox. On the beach littered with bodies is one with the name \"Ryan\" stenciled on his backpack. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell), learning that three Ryan brothers from the same family have all been killed in a single week, requests that the surviving brother, Pvt. James Ryan (Matt Damon), be located and brought back to the United States. \n\nSo I've never been a fan of movies made pre-2000's. It's not that I don't want to be, but I just haven't enjoyed older styles of filmmaking. However, being a lover of war films, I've been told repeatedly that I have to watch \"Saving Private Ryan\". Now being in college and having access to an on campus library where I can check out movies, I decided it was finally time. So, I checked out \"Saving Private Ryan\" and to my added surprise, I had a ton of fun with this film. \n\nLet's start out by saying that this is an all-star cast. A lot of guys from top to bottom have all made strong careers for themselves to date. A lot of them put up great performances, to the point where it's hard to point out any individual performance other than Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks really led the cast here and puts up an amazing performance like always. I love seeing him, as there haven't been a ton of films with him lately, so it's nice to see an older movie where he originally starred. I think even if you're not interested in this film, you should give it a chance based on the cast alone. \n\nFor a film made nearly two decades ago, it still holds up really well. Everything from the effects, set design, acting, etc, all hold up really well. This is honestly a film that could've been made today, just with a dated resolution. I think a lot of things were really strong, especially the fact that this film was a bit hard to watch at times. It goes with the strong message that war is ugly and nothing about it is pretty. The situation they're put in and no matter how many medals or awards you receive, nothing about the situation is fun. You're watching people die and limbs being blown off, and none of it is glorified. It's all supported with a fantastic score and it all came together to give us a really complete war film.\n\nIn the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it was actually one of the best war films I've ever seen. Chalk that up as a win for 90s movies.",

            "content": "Lauded by many to be the Greatest War Film Ever, well it just might be. At least in my books, it's the most complete war movie ever, it covers all aspect of a war, from the glory to the regret. It got realistic action ranging from battalion battle sequences to small squad action. The opening sequence was the most intense and gory battle scene I have come across. Got a human story to tell, the on-road adventure of a squad shows us all the faces of war, got camaraderie, humor, resentment, bravery, and cowardice. In the end not sure if it's an anti-war movie or a celebration of war. \n\nWatched the movie for the second time only, first being at the time of its release. Even though it's close to 20 years since its release, it's still got production values to make you feel it might have been released last year. The direction along with the performance by the cast makes it's a masterpiece.  The only complain I have is it was a tad too long.",
