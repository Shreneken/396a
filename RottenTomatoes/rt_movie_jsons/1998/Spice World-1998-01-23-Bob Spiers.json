There is basically No plot, I feel like the Spice Girls were told just do stuff and the camera was left on half the time because this isn't acting what they do and the rest is just average at best. Most of the music numbers have no good dancing or lavish colors and the cinematography is bland. The editing and pacing are terrible as this feels like a 10 minute music video made into a feature length film as a cash grab. The music itself is just ok with a few good ones here and there but is just boring to watch most of the time. Even if your a fan of the Spice Girls stay away from this and just listen to the albums.

I'm at the nostalgia level, I'd say.\n\nI remember watching 'Spice World' when I was very young and liking it, not sure to what degree but I certainly remember it. I undoubtedly enjoyed their music growing up, entirely truthfully... they did some bangers, don't @ me.\n\nAs for the film, which I probably haven't seen in 15+ years, I'll put it this way: Spice Girls as musicians: yes! Spice Girls as actresses: not quite. It's extremely cheesy and the acting is very subpar, but the likeability of Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton & Co. at least keeps it watchable; to me, anyway.\n\nRichard E. Grant commits to his role, while they also got James Bond himself, Roger Moore, involved. There are also a number of cameos. Their music is entwined well, I wouldn't class myself as a fan but I rate a fair amount of their songs.\n\nI can understand if you dislike this, I truly can, but I found it alright to be honest. I definitely wouldn't say it's anything good, or all that close, though. Fans of the group will love it, I presume.",

Plus, there are some surprisingly authentic and tender moments in the movie. It also doesn't hurt that there are some seriously impressive cameos.\n\nEverything in Spice World means something much deeper than what appears on the surface. Every time I thought to myself, \"...ok this is getting ridiculous,\" I paused. Why are there aliens visiting these girls while they are trying to take a group piss in the woods? Why is there a photographer crawling out of their toilet? Why is there a montage of them dressing up as each other? I encourage you to watch this movie and when you start to think to yourself, \"why,\" (which will happen about twice every scene) don't just roll your eyes and shake your head. Really ask yourself, what are they trying to say?\n\nOverall, am I going to start telling everyone they have to go watch it? Yes, actually. Well, maybe not everyone, but definitely those willing to give it a second or even first chance. I think there is real merit to this film. There isn't much out there that takes a satirical look at celebrity and the music industry in as interesting and entertaining of a way as Spice World. Wow, I can't believe I just wrote that.",

The film doesn't really have a plot; in fact, it is more of an anti-plot as the random flashbacks and dream sequences try to create some semblance of a story but just make everything more disjointed than before.  The lack of action brings all of the attention to the personalities of the girls.  If you don't have a favorite before watching this, you will after (or you will just despise them all, but they are actually pretty likable).  Despite the disdain of critics, this film was a box office smash.  While the Spice Girls have become a forgotten chapter in pop history, I appreciate that this film allows them to live on and serves as a reminder of how big they actually were.

Ah, I can't believe subjected myself to this film along with the people involved. It is not that this is an unoriginal piece of crap made by bunch of chuckling and sneering dorks, but it is an inconceivable exercise with barely any plotting or direction. I wonder if anyone even read the script or was developed. I guess this is or was supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek and self-reflective parody which could have worked if anyone knew what was going on. The music is really bad and the costumes are barely tolerable, but not as much as the Spice Girls. Spice World follows the Spice Girls wherever they go with all kinds of inane ideas and caricatures with musical montages, and only separated when we see another character besides the Spice Girls which a lot of the scenes seem to have been cut from other scenes. We have Hugh Laurie, Elvis Costello, and Roger Moore just to name a few. I could not believe the disorganization throughout the whole film which could qualify for ridicule by Mystery Science Theater 3000 since we have a scene involving aliens. The Spice Girls are made up of Mel C, Mel B, Ginger Spice, Baby Spice, and Victoria Beckham. Their film debut and music are well in synched with each other in terribleness. There are even few random moments that I thought I was going to chuckle, but never did. I would place this film with Pootie Tang. I know you are going to wonder why I bothered to watch this film in the first place and it's quite a long story, but what compelled me to see this happened after seeing it in a list of films that were going to be removed from Netflix. I already miss the chance to see Donnie Darko which is considered a cult class. I do enjoy the so bad, so good film once in a while. I clicked hoping to get a chuckle at its terribleness, but was not prepared. I won't tell you what I want. What I really want.

This is more like a collection of wild skits and music videos, jumbled together and rushed into movie theaters to capitalize on the bands ridiculous success.\n\nSo as a film, it's safe to say this is a complete failure, and a shameless cash in on the girl band's popularity. It simultaneously reinforces each member's stereotype, and yet complains about them. Tries to make us feel sorry for the girls with their grueling schedule and lack of freedom, yet presents the Spice Girls as spontaneous free spirits.\n\nOn the other hand though, the girls do get to drive around London in a Union Jack clad Double-decker bus driven by Meat Loaf!** The Spice Girls also have a close encounter and one of the visiting aliens, grabs Scary Spices's boobs! Richard O'Brien plays an uber-creepy paparazzo popping out from under fruit bowls, and the band's road manager is a wonderfully manic Richard E. Grant. Sir Roger Moore makes an appearance as a Bond-esk villain, resplendent in his Maoist suit, posing with an assortment of cute furry animals, including a piglet!\n\nThen there's the rest of the cameos: Michael Barrymore, Richard Briers, Elvis Costello, Bob Geldof, Stephen Fry, Jools Holland, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Jennifer Saunders, Jonathan Ross, and yes, I've missed some out! Everyone involved seems fully cognizant of the kind of movie they're in, even the Spice Girls themselves, and just seem to be having fun with it. So while this movie in every measurable way, sucks, I find it impossible to hate!\n\n* Ginger(Geri Halliwell), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham) and Scary (Melanie Brown)\n\n** Michael Lee Aday\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is a movie that's really just for fans of the Spice Girls, and/or those nostalgic for that period in time. It will also probably appeal to people in the UK more than anywhere else, due to all the cameo appearances from British talent.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is bright and colorful, but a regular DVD or streaming show will do. One idea. You could host a Spice Girl's themed fancy dress party! Have everyone (yes, guys, everyone) dress up as their favorite Spice Girl in some of their more iconic getup's (Geri Halliwell's form-fitting Union-Jack dress was always a hit!). Play the music, watch the film, consume a few tasty beverages, and have a blast!\n\n\nBest Moments:\n\nA hack Hollywood writer is pitching a story featuring the girls as a team of crime fighters called Spice Force Five. He explains each characters role in the gang, and we watch the master of espionage, Sporty Spice, being lowered on wires over a Subbuteo*** table to score a goal. I also liked each and every time Baby Spice smiles (okay, what can I do? She was my favorite!) :-)\n\n*** A table top football (soccer) game.\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/spice-world-1998/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "This frolicking British flick is colorfully insane every second of the way; this can clearly be seen from the impossibly-campy antics experienced by the Spice Girls between traveling tours to the girls' signature over-the-top costumes. The movie pokes fun at the girls' struggles with celebrity fame, media morons trying too hard to cash in on their brand and, of course, those malicious men who would love nothing more than to see the musical quintet dead in the eyes of the public. Borrowing more than a page from The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night, Spice World highlights the girls' best songs in strategic, and sometimes unexpected, locations; for example, their legendary \"Wannabe\" is sung impromptu at a local pub with a boom-box serving as the only musical backdrop. Like the Beatles' films, many numbers take place during concerts or recording sessions; however, unlike the Beatles, who performed glued to their instruments, Geri, Melanie G, Melanie C, Emma, and Victoria provide high-flying choreography in addition to their vocal talents. The ending song \"Spice Up Your Life\" demonstrates exactly why the girls were so popular. This sequence will make you want to get up and dance. \n\nThe film truly encompassed the decade of the 90's:  the obsession of retro furniture (just take a look at the interior of that traveling, double-decker bus!), platform boots so high they could reach the stratosphere, healthy amounts of \"girl power,\" and 'anything-goes' fashion (\"could somebody please tell me exactly what the dress code is here?\" one character remarks). The Spice Girls could have created a convoluted and overly-absorbing piece of cinematic self-promotion, (ie, the Monkees' film \"Head,\") but they have, instead, gone the more fun and carefree route by placing themselves in comic and embarrassing story-lite situations filled with fun, flair, and secret agents bottle-feeding baby piglets. My favorite sequence in when the girls are put through military training; each of the Spices don a green, unflattering camouflaged army outfit, except for Posh, who still retains her fashionable flash in a short, tight, army-patterned dress. It is silly to watch, sure, but I appreciate how the girls stay true to their public on-stage personas.\n\nThe upside and downside of Spice World is that its humor succeeds only half the time. While I believe taking the \"campiness\" out of the film would have been a major mistake, I also believe the film would have been much stronger as a whole if many jokes had been taken farther, instead of being cut halfway before reaching their humorous pinnacles. One such example is towards the end of the film when the British police stop the girls from reaching their concert at Albert Hall; Baby Spice approaches the officers with a pouty-puff display of innocence. Then... the scene cuts, and the girls (somehow) arrive unscathed to their concert a couple minutes later. If Baby Spice had gone farther in her pleas, (or if Ginger Spice had interfered by whacking the cops across their kissers,) I would have been more satisfied. \n\nBut despite the half-hearted attempt at many jokes, the far-fetched nature of the story disguised everything that did not work. I am annoyed by critics (both professional and amateur,) who give Spice World one star out of five. One star? Really? My personal rule-of-thumb is that one shouldn't call a film \"cheesy and all-over-the-place\" in a condescending manner if the film's intent was to present the world as being, well, cheesy and all-over-the-place. (Extra points to the alien encounter scene.) In all honest, I enjoyed the groovy and rockin' Spice World; while it did not ascend to the heights of A Hard Day's Night or Help, it is on-par with Herman's Hermits' musical comedies of the 60's.",
