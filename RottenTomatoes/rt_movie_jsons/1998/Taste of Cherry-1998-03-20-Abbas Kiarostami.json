Driving around the city, the seemingly well-to-do Badii meets with numerous people, including a Muslim student (Mir Hossein Noori), asking them to take on the job, but initially he has little luck. Eventually, Badii finds a man who is up for the task because he needs the money, but his new associate soon tries to talk him out of committing suicide.",

In the hilly and arid landscape outside Tehran, the suicidal Mr Badii travels the countryside searching for an accomplice in his unusual quest, which involves a large payment of money in exchange for a simple task – if his suicide attempt is successful, place twenty shovelfuls of dirt over his body.  A Taste of Cherry is poetic, hypnotic and challenging as it explores its complex themes.  One would think that a film set almost exclusively in and around a character's car would eventually grow stale, but it manages to hold the viewer's attention based simply on the intelligence of the dialogue.  Unfortunately, the pretentious final scene feels totally out of place and severely impacts the power of the film as a whole.  What a shame.",

Small-scale, but profound in implication. Sparse in explicit character detail, but entirely character-driven. Yup, it's a Kiarostami film alright. I swear, nobody has done pure humanity better than him, conveying these profound commentaries on different aspects of life that feel so tender and universal because of how carefully he constructs his characters and the realism that he imparts to his dialogue. Through small moments, he can set you on a path of self-reflection that digs up your own thoughts, fears, and hopes on a particular subject; in Taste of Cherry, it's the perception of life itself, particularly suicide. Homayoun Ershadi's Badii continuously tries to convince others to assist him in carrying out the end of his own life, promoting their involvement as a matter of practicality, religion, and mercy, among other features, in doing so revealing facets of his own personality as well as potentially changing his own conviction. And through all of this, there are never more than two people speaking to each other at a time.\n\nGreat film, an all-time classic whose scale contrasts its scope. (4.5/5)",

We have no idea why exactly Badii is willing to kill himself. And in this lack of explanation not only we're asked to focus on the 99-minute journey instead of the destination, but we're also implicitly informed that Badii's soul is no longer being tormented but it's already gasping out its last breath; which means it's not dead yet, though. If it hadn't been for Homayoun Ershadi, Badii would've seemed dead, even as he's driving his truck. For Eshadi's sorrow-laden eyes expose the misery that burdens Badii's soul and, in turn, prompts him to \"free [himself] from this life,\" and that what makes him clutching at a straw even if he himself is completely unaware of that. There's nothing surrounding him that could urge him to give the idea a second thought. All we see are some bleak and dismally empty and desolate landscapes. The sound of silence permeate the screen to reflect the excruciating ennui Badii feels, and the only sounds that break the silence intermittently are the cacophonous sound of machines or other jarring sounds. Kiarostami also detaches him, and us, from the world Badii has long forsaken, making us listen to conversations with the speakers almost off-screen. And the only life form Badii seems to observe are not of the people he interacts with—simply because his mind is solely concentrating on seeking someone to assist him do what he wants—but those of crows. Along his journey, innate goodness of human beings like \"refraining from doing any harm to anyone\" or \"offering a hand whenever encountering someone in need or trouble\" are manifested, but so long as these traits interfere with Badii's intent, they come off as hurdles to what he plans to do and they just end up pass by him unnoticed. As he's in a stage beyond any rational thinking, religious and philosophical advices fall on deaf ears as well. No one can change his mind. A long lecturing would definitely be of no help, unless beneath its veneer of didacticism lies a life-affirming power and an irrefutable optimism of an epiphanic impact. What kept me from giving this five stars is that the lack of information about Badii distanced me emotionally from him at the beginning. Regardless, Taste of Cherry is a minimalist masterpiece that celebrates life by showing us its value and beauty hidden in its simplicity.",

When he discloses his suicidal plan to 3 people in the film one by one, which is almost the whole film is, he offers them a good amount to bury him in his grave which he already digs, first two of them refuses to do so with some regional and ethical reasons and then comes the third person who agrees to do it for him because he needs money for treatment of his kid, but he tells him the importance and beauty of Life with his story, which is the whole film is about.\n\nThe film starts with dusty and rough places and moves to beautiful and colorful places as the story goes on which is brilliantly done, although the cinematography is not so dynamic, just a few simple shots yet beautiful and same one person camera angle in the whole film which may give an incomplete feeling of the film according to the story.\n\nIn the end, the film leaves the audience with a few question marks like did he die or not? why did he want to die? why did he want to die like this only?\nthese questions remain unanswered till the end but maybe the conversation with the third guy which says \"you will be alive when I come in the morning to put earth on your grave\" gives the Blurry answer to the ending!\nOverall film is a good story made for people looking for a good story only with a message. the people looking for fast entertainment will be disappointed for sure.",

I admit I was drawn into the story, as I am with most stories that have a question mark hanging over them. The cinematography and unique setting also help. However, the film was something of a letdown overall.\n\nWe never learn why the main character, Badii, wants to commit suicide, so it is hard to feel sorry for him. We just know he is in pain. It takes a while to even learn what Badii's motivation is. Early on the film hints he is looking to pay for some sort of homosexual hookup. This is just a sort of tease until we learn what he is really looking for.\n\nThen there is the final scene, which is a behind-the-scenes revealing shot a la the final shot in Ingmar Bergman's Persona. This is a cheap, faux-artsy move that adds nothing, but in fact detracts as it reminds us we're watching a film for some reason.

            "content": "cinegeek.de Our Daily Free Stream: Abbas Kiarostami - Taste Of Cherry (engl. subt.). Wer erinnert sich noch an das Drama in Cannes 1997? Abbas Kiarostami durfte in letzter Sekunde den Iran verlassen, um zur Premiere von The Taste Of Cherry zu gelangen. Stehende Ovationen gab es für Kiarostami vor dem Film. Am Ende gewann er die goldene Palme. Heute am Videotresen der Filmkunstbar Fitzcarraldo diskutierte ich mit zwei Kunden über den Film. Beide meinten, The Taste Of Cherry sei ein grosses Meisterwerk. Mir kam es so vor, als ob ich einen halbfertigen Film gesehen hätte. Eine Parabel über Leben und Tod, die man wunderbar vortragen könnte, so dass es sich immerhin wie ein grosser Film anhört... Die Geschichte: Ein Mann in einem Range Rover kurvt durch eine Landschaft in der Nähe Teherans, die aussieht wie eine riesige Baustelle. Der Mann heisst Mr. Badhi (Homayon Ershadi). Er will Selbstmord begehen und sucht jemanden, der ihn umbringt. Der Erste, den er fragt, aber, läuft davon. Selbstmord wird vom Koran verboten und so scheint das Unterfangen gar nicht so einfach. Schliesslich aber trifft er einen alten Mann, der Geld braucht und einwilligt. Trotzdem argumentiert der alte Mann, weshalb Selbstmord keine Lösung ist: Könnte er, Badhi, ohne den Geschmack von Kirschen leben? Kiarostami erzählt das in langen monotonen Einstellungen. Fast nie sieht man zwei Figuren während einer Einstellung. Gaaanz lange fährt der Range Rover durch die verwüstete Landschaft, dann wieder raucht Bahi in einer genauso langen Sequenz. Die beiden Kunden am Videotresen lobten Kiarostami, der so langsam und intensiv filmt. In einer Zeit, in der unsere Aufmerksamkeitsspanne immer mehr sinkt (so lerne ich), wäre The Taste Of Cherry ein heilsames Gegenmittel. Durch die Langsamkeit des Films könnte man sich voll auf das existentielle Dilemma des Mannes einlassen. Ich habe an sich überhaupt kein Problem mit langsamen Filmen. Ich liebe die japanischen Klassiker, ja bin süchtig nach ihnen! Kiarostamis Stil aber kommt mir affektiert vor. Sein Subjekt verlangt diese Monotonie gar nicht! Und Badhi? Können wir uns auf seinen Charakter, sein Dilemma, nun wirklich besser konzentrieren? Wäre es aber nicht hilfreich, ihn etwas besser zu kennen? Wissen wir überhaupt etwas von ihm? Kiarostami unternimmt keinen Versuch, uns diesen Mann näher zu bringen. Er lässt ihn nur bedeutungsschwanger in die Ferne blicken. Und ist es notwendig, dass wir Kiarostamis Kamerateam manchmal im Bild sehen? Soll uns das bewusst machen, dass eben alles nur ein Film ist? Ich hätte da allerdings eine schlechte Nachricht: The Taste Of Cherry kommt so leblos daher, dass ich nie wirklich in den Film eintauchen kann. Im Grunde gebe ich den beiden Kunden Recht: Es ist gut, wenn Filme nicht bloss ein Action-Gewitter sind! Gut, wenn ein persischer Regisseur heimlich dreht und damit so einiges riskiert! Ja, wir alle befürworten künstlerische Freiheit in der islamischen Republik! Ja, es gibt ganz grossartige Filme aus dem Iran! Ist aber The Taste Of Cherry eine Erfahrung, die ich nicht missen möchte? Nein. (Dazu gibts unsere Film List Filmauswahl Iran auf cinegeek.de",

The story is relatively simple enough.  Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) drives around Tehran looking for someone to burry him after he commits suicide.  Badii is willing to pay whoever the man is.  He has dug a hole in the hills somewhere and plans to lay in it and take some pills, he asks that whoever helps him to return at a certain time and call down to him, if he responds pull him up, if he doesn't cover him with dirt. \nBadii deliberately drives around areas of town where men are out of work and looking for odd jobs.  At first it is implied that he is a homosexual looking for sexual favors, but that quickly does not seem to be the case.  He finds a few men who seem they could use the money, but they refuse to help him.  He finally finds a Turkish taxidermist to help.\nThere is no mention of why Badii wants to committ suicide and there is little known about his character.  Where did he come from?  What does he do?  Where did he get that money to offer these people?  But, is all that really needed in a film this good?  Does a film always need to develop characters and provide as much backstory for them as possible so the audience can identify with them?\n\"Taste of Cherry\" is an Iranian film and Iran is a country that doesn't receive a lot of attention for their cinema, but recently Asghar Farhardi won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for \"A Separation\" and even received a Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination.  It's safe to say that maybe Americans should consider more Iranian cinema.",

If you're going to watch any of his films, this is the one. Kiarostami can brilliantly hold on a shot, and make you interested in what seems like things entirely uninteresting. The shots of the Range Rover driving along the edge of the sandy terrain of Tehran is absolutely stunning. The main character is an unknown weirdo to say the least, with kind of a Joaquin Phoenix quality about him. He desperately seeks an accomplice for his suicide. It's never really explained why he is committing suicide. The driving around conversations really gave off a Taxi Driver vibe, it could be that he's just a psycho. The story that helps him off the ledge by his third passenger is the best piece of dialogue in the film, and it seems so real in how uplifting it is. The only thing that left me feeling odd was the B-roll footage shown before the end credits. What did it mean? Why did Kiarostami place it in the movie? I would have rather the film ended with Mr. Baadi waiting for his accomplice to come bury him. It would've made for a stronger ending. But what do I know?",

It takes until towards the conclusion of 1st \"story\" for us to know what Mr. Badii's intent is, and when we find out he wants help from somebody to bury him the dialogue becomes very deep and thoughtful.\n\nThere are plenty of good lines in this film, such as \"you cannot use the spade, but you can use the gun,\" questioning the difference between two methods of going about killing somebody. There is definitely more of a cowardice behind the use of a gun, and the soldier embodies this by fleeing the car before answering if he will help Mr. Badii.\n\nThe film has a brilliant structure, making it seem like three stages of life. We have the young soldier, representing that we fear death in youth. Then we have a slightly older man who has a religious background who explains the problem with suicide. This represents an awareness of death, but the man trying to convince Badii that suicide is a sin shows not necessarily coming to terms with death just yet.\n\nThe final conversation is the longest, and it revolves around an older taxidermist. Not only is he closer to death than Badii, he is familiar with death since he is a taxidermist. He is also extremely wise and has a lot to say about why Badii should reconsider, but he also accepts the job, showing an acceptance of death. It is also important to note that the film takes place over one long day, and with night coming at the end of this day it represents the ending of life in a sense.\n\nThis is a really brilliant movie with such a strange ending that I still do not quite understand. I would have liked if the film had ended when they day ended rather than the ending that reflects on filmmaking. In my opinion, this is a near-perfect film.",

The film did give a clue to what Bahdli's issue  is, and if the film switched direction and totally abandoned what that clue might have led us  to, it's perhaps understandable, based on the kind of setting that Kiarostami had to work with. Through it all, I wasn't moved by any of its didactic rhetoric on how \"life is worth living\", but I was awestruck by Kiarostami's beautiful imagery - I probably wouldn't think of dying while watching them. There lies the film's genius, and the audiences are the ones who bear the irony here. Critics have labelled the film \"life-affirmative\", but I think the finale posed  more questions than answers. Sure, Kiarostami loves life, for its present, but he doesn't impose that understanding on others - and that is typical of him, a great humanist filmmaker.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThere was something about Taste of Cherry that hit me during my first viewing; it tackled the intimacy and quietness of suicide in such an honest way. Coming back to this, I hoped it would create a much larger impact on me, since I already knew what I was coming into and the ideas behind it couldn't be clearer; but sadly my experience did not improve, neither did it worsen.\n\nAfter recently seeing Heathers, suicide and the way it is conveyed in cinema has been on my mind, and very few films capture the irony and destruction of suicide as much as Heathers. Taste of Cherry plays out the opposite. What we have here is a film that shows the personal and intimate side of taking one's own life. It follows a man, only known as Mr. Badii, who has decided to take his own life and wants another person to aid him in creating the perfect suicide. The person that helps does not actually perform anything that would end his life; his role is only to check if he was still alive and if not he has to simply bury him. The entire film revolves around Mr. Badii searching for that one person that would help him, but with each shows resistance, even the one that would eventually accept his offer, as it would either frighten them or would go against their personal or religious values.\n\nAbbas Kiarostami, the film's director, does not provide the film any concrete answers; exposition is certainly low in regarding to the protagonist, and all we have to react to is the emotions that fill that car of his. The film rarely ever strays away from the vehicle, filling the time with conversations and mid shots that contains very little variety. The audience does not immediately gain sympathy for the protagonist, as it progresses in stages with each new passenger allowing us to feel closer to Mr. Badii. There is a correlating pattern with each new passenger, showing an increase of age, wisdom and empathy; Kiarostami understands that it is only when we are naturally closer to death and a large wealth of experience is running behind us, that we become much more understanding of death and the rich value of life. It is not up to us whether or not someone should or should not take their own life, but it is in our nature to influence others and aiding them in making the \"right\" decision.\n\nTaste of Cherry is no doubt a deep and emotional film due to its plot and the ideas it explores, but I personally feel it has stretched itself out for too long. The story itself is a simple one, and the ideas covering it are universal to the point where it could be established and conveyed to its audience within half the length of the film. I feel that the film would have worked better, in regards to its pacing and execution, if the film was 20 minutes shorter, or at least feature one sequence within the film that strays away from the repeated cycle, while still maintaining to the thematic intentions of the film of course.\n\nTaste of Cherry does what many filmmakers are afraid to do, telling an honest story about suicide. Death has become something regular in films, that sometimes the truth and heart behind it is lost; instead it is used as a way to shock its audience or to simply push the plot forward. The film allows us to stop and contemplate about the value of human life, and how others out there are battling their own personal demons, and are thinking to end it all just to gain that sense of relief, even for just a moment.",

This is the first movie of his I've seen so I can't exactly comment on him as a whole yet, but from what I understand he is very much a challenger of film convention. That is certainly confirmed after watch Taste of Cherry, a film that I both liked and didn't like for very distinct reasons. For one thing I don't think film was exactly the right format for telling this story. Abbas is almost stubbornly minimalist as scenes go in the same basic order until the ending. Mr Badii drives around, picks someone up. the two men converse and he explains his plain to commit suicide. He does this multiple time until someone agrees. I think that as a film it sort of fails to bring any kind of entertainment or even much to think about in terms of themes or overall messages. I think the story might be better served simply as a written short story or maybe even a short film, It could even work well as a stage play. It's a movie for hardcore film analysts so I'd never recommend it to a casual audience. I think Roger Ebert had the best summation of the movie in the review for one of Abbas's other films \"10\". \"The fatal flaw in his approach is that no ordinary moviegoer, whether Iranian or American, can be expected to relate to his films.

It's not immediately clear what his intents are, even though one could predict it, there's also the possibility of him being a hit man. But he's not, he's just ready to end his life premature. The film grapples with deep ethical questions, and how much man is willing to stick to his roots. Some would say they'd never partake in assisted suicide no matter the money involved, and some the opposite. Similarly when the opportunity approaches it's much different than just having it as a rhetoric. The film is head deep in symbolism, and despite not much being said, everything is clear. The ending didn't really connect with me. Like Close-up (also directed by Kiarostami) the ending is up to many interpretations, but I think one thing is clear, it shows at the end it's a film.

Unfortunately, Kiarostami spoils what could have been a perfect ending by attempting to \"meta\" or \"postmodern\" or \"self-reflexive\" and to close by zooming out to show the film being made.  This rather tired device somewhat ruins what could have otherwise been a pitch-perfect exploration of alienation, which Kiarostami epitomizes with the experience of driving in a car.

We don't know this man, but we want him to live, but yet, we want each person to accept the money. It's a complex way we feel about our main character, but not in a confusing way. For the 30 minutes, it's emotions speak louder than the film itself. After that the film makes effective statements on life and death (mostly life). Which all of this leads us up to, by far, the greatest scene in the film. The SECOND we realize Mr. Badii has emotions, he runs after Mr. Bagheri, which was very powerful. It was a feeling of shame and realization of his actions, but he didn't exactly do what we kind of expected, but it got the same message out.

The movie has a tendency to jump from one important scene to another with no bridges, no explanations. I'm sure there are people who would say that the movie doesn't need those bridges. I disagree. A true master of his craft may be able to tell a story without them, but for most of us, those bridges and story-telling techniques are there for a reason. They are needed to make the story flow more smoothly. To leave them out altogether makes the movie seem jumpy and jarring, as if there wasn't enough time to film certain scenes. On the other hand, the ending scene feels completely unnecessary and stylistically broken.\n\nStill, the movie has its upsides. The dialogue, for the most parts, is really good and captivating, as are the actors. The movie has its own unique style, the lack of music fits the mood and I actually enjoyed the story, unevenly told as it might have been. So yeah, just slightly below average, but worth a watch, in my opinion.",
