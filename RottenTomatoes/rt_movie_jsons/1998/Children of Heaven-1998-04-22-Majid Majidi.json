Considering that his family lives in abject poverty, unable to pay their rent or debts, he understands the financial impact that this will have on all concerned and develops a plan to hide the truth from his parents.  The acting is great, especially from the youngsters, and the movie is lovely to look at and is generally well made. Criticisms?  How much times needs to be devoted to watching children run around?  Seriously, it's ridiculous how many shots there are of young kids clopping about the streets in a hurry to get somewhere.  Just when you think you've had enough of children darting about, the climax of the film involves\u2026wait for it\u2026here it comes\u2026a running race involving hundreds of kids that goes on seemingly forever.

            "content": "First of all, these child actors in Children of Heaven are some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. I was so in love with them from early on, and their sweet personalities just endeared me to them a little more each minute. I was worried about them, and could not stand watching them struggle. I completely bought into their entire journey and how the simple act of losing a pair of shoes led to so much adventure for both of them. Each time they faced another dilemma I was rooting for them to overcome it, and I was brought close to tears once or twice. I cannot say enough about how much these two young actors sold the story and kept me connected to the film. There were some side stories that I originally thought were odd distractions and I could not comprehend how they mattered to the main plot, but by the end I found there was a purpose. When it hit the climax, I cannot express how much I was cheering aloud at the screen. And when I wasn\u2019t hollering with excitement I was holding my breath with anticipation. This one moment had more thrills for me than any I\u2019ve watched in the entire 2018 Olympic games, and I wasn\u2019t even rooting for the protagonist to win (for those who\u2019ve seen the film, you know what I mean.) The emotion that overwhelmed him at the end swept over me as well, because I was so invested in that scene. My one complaint was the conclusion of the film. I\u2019ve seen too many movies like this lately where we know what the end is going to be so they just decide to stop everything early and force you to just imagine what comes next. Sometimes I want the joy of seeing it play out. After all the stuff that went on, I felt like our characters earned that moment, but the film-maker decided to deprive us of that. One might argue that the reality could never live up to what we might imagine, but I wish they had at least tried. Despite the disappointment I felt when the credits rolled, Children of Heaven was an emotional film with enough charm to fill up a dozen other movies.",

Now he and Zahra have to share shoes at school, a situation which causes all sorts  of problems.  Ali comes up with other plans to get Zahra a pair of shoes.  Meanwhile, Zahra thinks she may have tracked down the new owner of her shoes.\n\nSweet movie from Iran.  The spin-off events from the loss of the shoes and the adventures of the kids are quite entertaining.  Also a great, warmth-filled reminder of life's simple pleasures and how things which may seem unimportant to one person in one culture and/or socio-economic sphere can be vitally important to someone with different circumstances.\n\nNot particularly profound though.  The movie doesn't really come up with much in the way of profundities or even a powerful conclusion (in fact, the conclusion is fairly weak).  It's a simple, linear story with very few frills or great twists, told engagingly and with great warmth.\n\nThe movie was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1999 Oscars, losing out in the end to Life is Beautiful.",

The story revolves around a pair of shoes, or rather its absence; never did I imagine that a pair of shoes can sustain my interest for 90 minutes. Writer/Director Majidi tackles issues like poverty, necessity, selflessness, purity of childhood, sibling-love, perseverance and determination with such aesthetic and charm, without being melodramatic.\n\nAfter five minutes into the movie, the kid Ali confesses to her sister Zahra that he lost her shoes and he couldn't find them; the innocence and sadness portrayed in this scene draws you into their lives immediately. The two kids are the heart and soul of the movie, and carry the movie forward with their range of genuine and varied emotions; the director draws out such powerful and sublime performances out of them. Even the supporting performances of Ali's father and the-small-girl-in-school are quite commendable.\n\nLosing something you're entrusted to, getting into trouble at home/school, asking your sibling/friend to cover up for you, sharing responsibilities when someone you care is sick, determination to win something with a larger goal in mind - these themes are so universal that a kid or adult from any place could easily relate to. The story might seem too linear and optimistic to some, but it portrays a world of love and selflessness. People, especially kids, with lesser means are often more selfless and helpful than their fellow beings with more riches; they appreciate and understand the value of even the simplest and smallest of things.\n\nThe incidents, the adventures, and the whole running around due to the missing pair of shoes teaches them a lot of things. All the running around eventually pays off when Ali gets selected into the school race team; we never really realize how we acquire certain talents.\n\nOther than the brilliant acting, the artistically shot scenes and the remarkable background score add to the beauty and feel of the movie. The seven-minute kids' race sequence towards the and is quite craftily shot and directed. There are so many scenes which are memorable, and stay etched in your mind for a long time.",
