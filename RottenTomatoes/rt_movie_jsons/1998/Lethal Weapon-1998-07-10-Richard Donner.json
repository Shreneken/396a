            "content": "\"Lethal Weapon 4\" is the fourth installment of the \"Lethal Weapon\" franchise, and it features the same characters as the previous movies. The plot is relatively straightforward, with the protagonists trying to take down a group of Chinese smugglers. The action scenes are decently choreographed, but they lack the excitement and tension that made the previous movies so enjoyable. The comedy is also lackluster, with most of the jokes feeling forced and predictable. Overall, \"Lethal Weapon 4\" is an underwhelming addition to the franchise and fails to capture the magic of the earlier films.",

            "content": "A Solid Conclusion and a Classic to the franchise in addition to being a significant improvement over the very forgettable third entry. The acting is solid overall, Riggs is much more toned down here and more natural which helps a lot. Gibson & Glover still have good chemistry and the humor hits more often than it misses with no jokes being terrible just flat at worst. The supporting cast is not bad also, and I am glad Leo is much more controlled and toned down here. Jet Li is a decent villain and better than the third one, but not as good as the second. The cinematography, action, camerawork and special effects are all solid. Sometimes the action can be over the top but its entertaining nonetheless. There also is much less plot hole than the previous one. The music isn't bad but not as memorable or as catchy as the first two. Editing and Pacing wise its solid the whole way through. Sometimes it jumps around between the two leads personal stories and the Triad Plot but for the most part it works well. The character development is much more natural here and satisfying. It's rare to say a fourth entry is a solid film let alone a good conclusion to the franchise. If you really like action films or any of the actors in this or Donner than watch this! I'd say watch the 1 & 2, Skip 3 (So Forgettable) and go straight to this to end it.",

The acting from the larger-than-usual group of stars is stellar, Jet Li's character is a memorable villain, the jokes made me laugh quite a bit, the action sequences are some of the best in the series and the movie builds upon its predecessors, mainly in Riggs' character arc, leading to an admittedly poignant penultimate scene. Not everything clicks as well as it should but, when you look at movies like Die Hard 5, Lethal Weapon 4 ends the series on a surprisingly high note, especially given how action movies tend to succumb really badly to the law of diminishing returns. Good job, guys.",

The way Donner was able to control and shoot that scene was sight to behold. I enjoyed Jet Li's character as well. Arguably the best villain in the series. Joe pesci and Rene Russo are back and still great. And of course the chemistry between Danny and Mel are on full display. From the first scene on, you could they were really enjoying being back.\n\n\nAll in all, LW4 is a solid send off to a great franchise.",

The rudimentary process and the urge to leave the scene or cut to next scene with either a bang or a punch line that defies logic and practicality, pretty much gives it away within its first few minutes where the feature may lie. \n\nThe franchise still hasn't solved its antagonist problem, for it never oozes threat as it should nor does it projects the stake at risk; it's all possible, it's all easy with a tougher sacrificial routine. It is again low on its technical aspects like choreography, sound department and editing. \n\nThe screenplay by Channing Gibson is actually a mixology of all the spicy ingredients extracted from the commercially successful feature, adding it up and waiting for the outcome which too in here isn't handled well by Richard Donner; the director, as usual is short on executing the script addition to that it also failed to project the brotherhood that was present in the previous installments. The performance by Mel Gibson seems a bit derailed whilst Donald Glover seems to be focused with a humorous supporting cast like Joe Pesci and Chris Rock. \n\nLethal Weapon 4 is every bit of a misguided mishap as its predecessor and more for it sucks out the soul from it.",

            "content": "There was a time when this franchise was thought to be finished. There was a neat little trilogy which ended quite sufficiently story wise. The main two actors were getting on in years, there seemed to be no real reason to go back to this well. Funny, we find ourselves in that very spot yet again, apparently.\n\nSo back in 1997 Warner Bros had a bad summer with its crop of releases. The studio needed a big hit and fast, and that safe bet was the [i]Lethal Weapon[/i] franchise. Alas things did not go overly smoothly with an unfinished script and short production time. The actual script was never completely locked down and changed throughout the production. Regular character Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) was brought back after initially being kicked out, whilst new character Butters (Chris Rock) was also introduced late in the game (being gay originally). Its worth pointing out that the movies ending had also not been written when the cameras started rolling for the first time.\n\nSo this time the plot moves away from drug smuggling and into people smuggling. The lads stumble across a Chinese immigrant smuggling ring being run by some Triads. These bad guys are forcing one specific Chinese man (who clearly has some special skills) to engrave plates to create counterfeit Chinese money. In exchange for this the Triads are bringing his family to the US. Murtaugh and Riggs find themselves helping this specific family whilst trying to crack the illegal smuggling ring. So essentially its the same thing all over again, just swap out drug shipments for people shipments.\n\nI think the main issue with this movie is the fact it lacks action, for an action movie. There is a huge focus on the characters and their family lives here, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does get a tad dull. You don't really feel like you're watching an action movie, more like a TV comedy series. Overall I felt the movie struggled to keep things interesting. That being said, this movie did take a surprising turn back towards the original in terms of being somewhat darker, both content wise and visually.\n\nBoth Riggs and Murtaugh are getting way too old for this shit. Riggs spends most of his time complaining about how old he's getting, and we are indeed shown how old he's getting in a few scenes. Where as Murtaugh is quite frankly past it, you're left wondering how this guy is still working on the force...in the field! The duo no longer come across like a mismatched pair of cops, but more like a mismatched pair of old fogies having a fun day out from their retirement home.\n\nLorna Cole (Rene Russo) is also back but has now been reduced to a background character that is pregnant. She is no longer kicking ass with a smug grin on her face, oh no. Now she's lurching around slowly, heavily pregnant and stuffing her face with all manner of foods (because pregnancy equals cheap food gags). Whilst on one hand this angle is further expanding the story for both her and Riggs, it does kinda spoil her character. I really don't think we needed to see that, surely they could have set the movie after she had the baby?\n\nAs said Leo is back too and just as daft as ever. This time Leo has become a private eye so now he has a badge and can kinda get in on the action legally. Again its the same scenario with Leo Getz, he's a funny character but way way too stupid for this type of flick. Well that's what I would be saying but we all know this franchise turned into a slapstick comedy affair so technically he fits in fine. Its just a shame that they had to fall back on old jokes (a common problem with sequels). Did we really need another 'they fuck you at the drive-thru' gag? Sure its amusing but you mean to tell me they couldn't think of anything new?\n\nNew character Detective Lee Butters (stupid name) is secretly getting married to Murtaugh's daughter (who is also pregnant) which is one comedy aspect to his characters story. The other being the new comedy double act that arises between him and Leo. This starts up by Leo inadvertently mistaking Butters for a perp and Butters taking offense, making it racial etc...From there on Leo thinks Butters is too touchy and Butters is always ragging on him. This was a neat little set up but its tainted because you know perfectly well its only in the movie to serve Chris Rock's stand-up routines. At the time Rock was the new comedic sensation in the USA and clearly that got him this gig. Bottom line, Rock was badly miscast and stuck out like a sore thumb. Every time he spoke it just felt like part of his stand-up act, like the movie pauses just so he can have his little spot.\n\nAgain the villains in a Lethal Weapon movie aren't all that intimidating or threatening. The Chinese bad guys here were generally faceless (as usual) except for Uncle Benny (Kim Chan) who was too old frankly. The actor playing him really didn't come across as if he could actually act, whilst his character just doesn't do anything (probably because he looked around 90 years old. Think old man Lo Pan in 'Big Trouble in Little China'). Then you had Jet Li in his first American movie, and first role as a bad guy. Now where as Li is perfectly fine as the mysterious silent bad guy, he's clearly too over-powered for the movies protagonists. Yet at the same time he's still not that overly intimidating, he's more like a deadly monk. He didn't even dress like a baddie.\n\nAnd herein lies another issue with this movie, the main bad guy is just too powerful. During the movie we are shown how strong, agile and skilled Li's character is. Yet in the finale battle between Riggs, Murtaugh and Wah Sing Ku, the good guys win. Its a typical problem with many similar movies. The highly skilled martial artist bad guy can defeat just about anyone effortlessly, but can't beat the aging good guys. This literally makes a mockery of the entire movie really. Not to mention the quite ridiculous moment when Murtaugh saves Riggs from drowning in the final showdown. Talk about movie magic and suspension of disbelief.\n\nIn the end this late entry in the franchise felt completely unnecessary. Merely milking the last few drops out of the franchise whilst they still could; whilst the actors were still just about able to pull it off. Did it work? Was it unnecessary? Well yes and no. Overall the movie definitely looks better, moodier, and felt a bit darker/edgier in tone. It certainly feels more like the franchise of old rather than the cartoonish third sequel. But that said it simply cannot escape the feeling of being somewhat unmerited because they kinda tied everything up OK in said third movie. All the soppy family guff we get at the very end was basically not needed, much like this movie truth be told. But surprisingly its actually better than the third movie.",

It gets old and uninteresting where it's the same characters doing the same schtick over and over. Pesci being goody, Glover being old and tired (for lack fo a better character description) - it's the same formula every time just with a new but somewhat similar drug bust scenario. The chemistry between Gibson and Glover is still amazing but milking out a new film every 2 years it will get stale.

This film improves on all aspects of the previous film and it delivers high octane action scenes with few of the best comedy scenes of the series, for which the Laughing Gas scene is a great example and not to mention the scenes between Chris Rock and the leads. Jet Li is the best villain of the series thus far and the whole proceedings are great. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover share real good chemistry in this film as well. Gibson seems to have gotten old because most of his stunts(in the truck) are performed by stunts men and these were usually did by the star himself.

If there's Jet Li, there's gotta be some spectacle to exploit him. Lethal Weapon 4 is my favorite sequel of the series, with constant action scenes and even some ridiculously spectacular ones too to show the franchise's final efforts to capitalize on itself. It was fun, and that's the least I expect from a movie with this cast and director.\n\nLethal 4 is by no means the less flawed of the franchise; probably it's the most troublesome about it. Nevertheless, at this point all I'm expecting is huge fun, even if it is ridiculous. If there's people that like Rocky IV, easily there's people that like Lethal 4, and I'm part of them. Yeah, I kinda hate Rocky IV, but I can't help it. In Lethal 4 I do find some reasons to love it more than hate it. Maybe it's because it does entertain me legitimately, or because Glover and Gibson still had it as Murtaugh and Riggs, or because their characters do face new facets of their lives: Riggs is dealing with marrying once more, and not only that, also becoming a father, while Murtaugh is dealing with becoming a grandfather and father-in-law of a person he's not very friendly with. In Rocky IV, the characters didn't evolve and didn't go anywhere they already went through. Here, in Lethal 4, they actually face new things, both also dealing with getting too old for this shit. This is also the longest of the series, running two hours and 7 minutes. Those were two hours and seven minutes of my life I don't regret spending here. I had fun, big fun, and I liked it.\n\nMaybe I'm either too young or too old for this shit, but I liked this final entry in the series. You know there are worse out there, and I think this one holds itself as one of those final entries that we can love. It has action and fun, no strings attached. A bit more conviction from the first movie would have made this the best in the series, but for what it is, I was satisfied. Lethal 4 goes out with a bang, and it's one of my favorite action movies...and also one of the most ridiculous.",

We are so distant from the original characters and from the unforgiving cold-blooded action of 10 years ago that we are left scratching our heads watching the ending, the Hollywood-esque humor and the happy family picture that concludes the film and that has Donner saying: \"That's it, I'm done. If any sequel comes out after this, it won't be because of me\".\n\nThere was a menace of a Lethal Weapon 5 back in 2010 that was supposed to be released in 2012.

It immediately fills itself full of cheap but effective humour for its various characters and brings it to an action comic book feel as its full of cartoonish moments and high voltage action, as well as separating the four characters into essentially two hilarious duos, namely the classic Mel Gibson and Danny Glover duo, but this time the new addition of Chris Rock teamed up with a freshly funnier than ever before in Lethal Weapon films Joe Pesci, and the two share an impeccable chemistry with various hilarious moments with each other and other characters due to the strongly over-the-top line delivery. They just all work really well, and despite not having the funniest script of the Lethal Weapon series, they all deliver the necessary laughs even though it descends into routine and predictability without any real hint of drama save from Lorna Cole becoming pregnant. Rene Russo gave a decent performance in the role, but more for a comedic sense so there was no real feel for drama and so she really didn't have much to work with, or get in on the action because her character was pregnant. But the action truly overshadows it all, and features well-choreographed fights and shootouts matched with an intense amount of blood and gore. Jet Li is also awesome to have on board for the sake of the action. The entire cast is awesome.\nAnyway, the atmosphere in Lethal Weapon 4 is consistently intense and the musical score is strong in ensuring that, so Richard Donner has clearly lost none of his touch as a director as he still maintains great tenacity in handling Lethal Weapon 4, which is no problem for him as he delivers the same grace as director which made it an awesome series in the first place.\nOnce the awesome action from the intro slows down however, Lethal Weapon 4's momentum goes into a rapid decline. This is because the action is so high voltage, so fast, so immediate, that when it becomes briefly absent the pacing suddenly drops and viewer's interest cannot be held unless there is sufficient humour on screen. And since the standards for humour are set relatively high, it's difficult for Lethal Weapon 4 to achieve this. It does it fairly consistently, but the scenes where it fails to are somewhat memorable unfortunately.\nBut overall Lethal Weapon 4 is a fine film technically, is entertaining, and has plenty of awesome action which overshadows its issues.",

Jet Li was a cool villain, playing a mean triad affiliate who will have no trouble karate kicking your butt if you even look at him in the wrong way. Remains guilty of the same cheesy humour which is meant to please middle-age audiences, mostly through the clumsy, fast talking, verbal punching bag known as Joe Pesci.

But, that doesn't last long, after they and Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) discover a ship full of Chinese slaves. Their investigations lead them to crime boss Benny Chan (Kim Chan) and hardass Triad negotiator Wah King Su (Jet Li). Meanwhile Riggs has married Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) as is about to become a father, while Murtaugh has growing pains all of his own. It's a very silly film, and it's just an excuse to see them blow stuff up and shout comedic insults at one another.

Lethal Weapon 4 was a great way to end the Lethal Weapon series. I'm just surprised I never got tired of watching Riggs and Murtaugh on screen. They're just so great together and it shows in each Lethal Weapon movie. I never got tired of these movies. Each movie holds up so well. Lethal Weapon 4 was an excellent end to an excellent series. This one even has a really good cast. It has Jet Li as the best villain in a Lethal Weapon movie (he's right up there next to Gary Busey in the first). Leo Getz is actually really funny in this one (to be honest, I found him irritating in the previous films). Now, just like the third movie, the first half of four isn't as good as the second half. It gets much better as the movie progresses. I love how the final fight scene is just as intense as the fight scene at the end of the first, but this time Murtaugh is involved in the action. Overall: Lethal Weapon is the series that redefined Buddy-cop action movies. Lethal Weapon 4 is a great ending to it all. Movie Letter Grade: A- Series Letter Grade: A",

Gibson and Glover are as good as they were int the previous 3 films but the main reason I feel this film was an amazing send off to the series that spawned the buddy cop action genre that we have seen ever since the 1st lethal weapon film is the last 15 minutes of runtime in this film.

This will not stand as one of the best in all the series partly due to the fact that the plot here is a little lazy than the ones we saw in Lethal Weapon 1 and Lethal Weapon 2. Lethal Weapon 3 may have had the best intro scene but it too was just lazy in the aspect of its script, as it was more like let's get a girl for Riggs than it was let's make a buddy cop movie.\n\nHere the duo are up against the Kung Fu fighting Jet Li, his introduction added the Kung Fu genre in to this action comedy and Richard Donner the director just didn't have what it took to make this Lethal Weapon a master piece, but if this movie is to stand on its own it is a nice action comedy.\n\nAgain the score is done by the trio of Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton & David Sanborn, although here the whole hip addition didn't make me enjoy the score as I did in the previous movies.\n\nIn this flick our buddy cop duo is up against the Chinese Triads. Riggs, Murtaugh and Leo were fishing when they came across a smuggling ship, and as usual by accident they ended up crashing the ship.\n\nNow they are cut between human trafficking and the murder of three people on the ship. The Triads are in America with Jet Li as Wah Sing Ku being in charge of the operations, Riggs and Murtaugh are trying hard to be able to piece together what the Triads are up to, and the connection between their operations and the human smuggling.\n\nBut as this was going on both Riggs and Murtaugh are expecting. Riggs girlfriend Lorna is pregnant with their first child and Murtaugh eldest daughter Rianne is pregnant with hers. Roger however doesn't know who Rianne's baby daddy is, but Riggs knows that it is Detective Lee Butters (Chris Rock) and he uses this to play tricks on Roger making him think Butters is gay.\n\nI do commend the producers in their ability to maintain the cast, right from the first to the forth The Murtaugh family of Husband, Wife and three kids have been the same cast from the first to the last. Riggs and his new found love Lorna from the third was also here in this last one, the captain has been the same all through the series, and Leo Getz that was introduced in the second was also maintained although the series.\n\nWhat can I say, I did enjoy watching the crazy duo again for the fourth time, and the DVD box set of all four movies is one you will like to own.\n\nPlans are there for a reboot or continuation of the Lethal Weapon franchise, I just hope they won't blow it.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "Right, I'm going out on a bit of a limb here-\n\nIt's pretty great.\n\nSeveral things should be taken into consideration with this one. First and foremost- it's number 4-  not just a sequel or even a third but a fourth. The fact that it could even be considered worth watching is mad. \n\nSecondly, it's Lethal Weapon- the Lethal Weapon series does not take it's self seriously, and nor should it, it has always been a Hollywood action popcorn series- sure, the first one had a more cutting edge to it but I don't think any of the instalments since then have been failures, they just took a less-serious approach which I don't mind at all.\n\nThirdly and finally- it's a wrap-up. Despite the rumours of a fifth one (I think it's been ruled out now though), this is the final instalment in a fairly iconic series. As a result of this it has some responsibilities which means it's a movie that's only going to appeal to followers of the series, it shouldn't be viewed simply as a stand-alone action flick.\n\nWith these things in mind I shall explain why I think this movie is a success- \n\nThis is a real continuation- Joe Pesci doesn't suddenly become someone else and all the classic cast members are there. Not only that but the charm of the previous instalments is still there too.\n\nIt modernises without compromising- To keep things fresh there's new editions in the form of Jet-Li and Chris Rock. Now we needed a bad guy so you could say Jet-Li wasn't much of a modernisation so much as a necessary addition but the style and flash he brings is very much new to the series.  His strengths were used well too- this is a well-shot action flick with strong action sequences.\nChris Rock's presence was more of a risk-  I love Joe Pesci's performances in Lethal Weapon 2, 3 and 4 and so what's the point in Chris Rock being there then other than to add a fresh, successful name? I don't have an answer to that but I don't think it matters too much- he works in this film. His humour just fits- it's a good piece of casting if you ask me.\n\nIt satisfies a hardcore fan, albeit at the expensive of more casual audiences- It's got a big wind-up, it properly ends everything in the cheesiest way possible and this is something it's clearly building up to throughout- If it was my introduction to the series, I probably wouldn't enjoy it but you really shouldn't start at the end- as a fan of the series, I was satisfied with the ending and I wanted a lot from it, I wanted the cheesiness in all it's glory and I'm glad that I got it and I'm pleased this film placed such importance on ending everything for the fans. (Take note Die Hard, though it's far too late for you now *sigh*).\n\nIt still isn't old- maybe it's just me, but even with it following the structure of previous instalments (particularly a really cool and funny opening scene) it doesn't feel old or tired (though Murtaugh surely did). \n\nI guess it comes down to what a 4th instalment should be. They are such rarities in the first place that it's hard to judge but I see it as an extension pack to the trilogy- it's the final act, a goodbye if you will. And guess what? It's a big nostalgia fest, quite a ridiculous one, it gets very sentimental which makes it pretty mental in general.  All of this is good for me though, it's good for me because that's exactly what I wanted. What else should a 4th instalment be? If it was just another standard Lethal Weapon then I wouldn't be satisfied with it as a conclusion to the series. I think it made some smart moves to keep the film fresh and hopefully to make it relatively enjoyable to any action movie fan, not just someone who is a dedicated fan. I understand though, if I didn't care much about the previous instalments, or maybe only cared about one of them, since most people tend to enjoy the first one the most, then I would just want this movie to be over. I wouldn't have the connection with the series and I completely understand that people feel that way.\n\nAs a 4th instalment I think it ticks all of the necessary boxes. Subtlety certainly isn't what it's going for- I think this is a movie for the fans and that it's perfectly deserving of their appreciation, certainly of mine at least.",

I find it incredible that the magic is still there. The main characters still feed of each other and their friendship (both on set and off set) is clearly felt in every scene they have together. Mel Gibson has finally laid the ghost of his wife to rest and is as chipper as ever. He does this without seeming truly obnoxious (even though that is a part of his character). In fact he seems more likable in this film than he did in all the previous films. Danny Glover reprises his role from the previous movies and that is not a bad thing because the Murtaugh role is the best of his career. Rene Ruso returns in her part and although it has been cut down considerably its still a decent role. Joe Pesci is also back and this time around he gets to add some depth to the character (something that was missing in the previous film). Chris Rock is decent. He isn't much of an actor but he is pretty funny and fresh. His part also adds a little something to the all-round comedy of the film, but if you want to know what it is you will have to watch the movie yourself. Jet Li is the villain in this movie and while he is the weakest villain in the series acting wise, he is definitely the most menacing.\n\nThe action is still brilliant despite the fact that the actors are getting older. The story is decent for a fourth film and the overall execution is brilliant. I actually prefer this film to the second and third of the series because I find it to be more entertaining overall. It cuts down on the seriousness (even though its still there) and adds a lot to the comedy and this is a very good choice.\n\nAll in all an excellent film. Highly recommendable for all fans of action movies and the series in particular.\n\n8/10",

However, as the two are getting older, the more obvious it becomes that a stunt double are being used more often. Chris Rock was decent, offering his motormouth style of comedy. Jet Li was excellent as the villain, both as a material artist and as a sinister threat, the real mastermind of the plot. Pesci's character also improves from the annoying being he was in \"Lethal Weapon 3,\" but his character still doesn't add anything to the film. Richard Donner keeps the stunt work of the first three films and there are some excellent sequences, especially involving Jet Li's fighting ability. There are good gun battles and a excellent car chase on the freeway which was done with traditional action techniques. However some elements in the story is just filler like the car chase and the officers question Uncle Benny for information.

The story is really good and is told like it. There are also some exciting action scenes especially the last fight scene. The movie also keeps up with the humor from the first 3 movies. I wasn't, though, a big fan of the Chinese family they included in this one and while he does an admirable job, there's a part of me that wishes they could have found someone other than Chris Rock to be Rianne's husband.

Chris  Rock  for  some  God  for  saking  reason  is  in  the  movie  and  is  most  of  the  time  annoying.  He  is  just  too  loud. You  don't  have  to  scream  everytime  you  talk. If  you  think  it  is  funny  guess  again  Rock. He  is  the  father  of  Murtough's  grandchild.  He  seceretly  is  with  Murtough's  daughter. And  Jet  Li  is  the  bad  guy.

The storyline has just been used so much that its exhausted...the whole \"I'm getting too old for this\" thing is just so boring at this point.  The storyline is the main problem I have with this film.  Not only is it tired, but it's just dumb.  Beyond that, I can't really say much.  Gibson and Glover are good as usual, but the supporting cast choices are pretty bizarre.  The returning players from Lethal Weapon 3, like Joe Pesci and Rene Russo, aren't used effectively.  I wasn't a fan of Pesci in the last one, and while I like his character, he's just really annoying here.  Maybe he's not as annoying overall, but he's totally unnecessary in this film, while he was necessary to the story in Lethal Weapon 3; that's probably why I find him more annoying.  While I liked Rene Russo in the last one, she isn't in a lot of scenes here; her character is supposed to be pregnant, so she's as embedded in the story as she could be.  When she does get involved in the story, it's usually in fight scenes, which are pretty obsurd to see because she's supposed to be several months pregnant.  \n\nThe rest of the cast, particularly Chris Rock and Jet Li, are just weird choices like I said...why would you put them both together in the same movie, first of all? Chris Rock can be funny at times, I'll admit, but his sole purpose is to be a running joke that Riggs starts.  I won't go into detail, but while it's pretty funny at first, it drags later on because they bring it up every time Rock shows up.  Moving on, Jet Li kicks a lot of ass here, but as this is far from a straight-up kung fu movie, he's pretty damn out of place here.  I'd also like some sort of a backstory of any kind for his character, but apparently the writers thought this was too much to ask for.\n  \nWatch this if you're a fan of the Lethal Weapon movies, but don't expect to watch it more than once.",

But the addition of Lee Butters played by Chris Rock was simply not needed, if they wanted to make him Murtaugh's son in law that is fine but do NOT make him this big a character, mainly because no mater what his character is he will be playing himself and I do not when you put a comedian into an action film.  As for the cast, Mel Gibson is still able to play Riggs with ease, Danny Glover will always be remembered as Murtaugh in my eyes, Joe Pesci is still the lovable and at times annoying Leo Getz, and Chris Rock had the unneeded role of Lee Butters.  jet li was a good villain and I enjoyed his character even if he did not say much, his fighting made up for that (in other words, martial arts fans will be pleased).  I have come to love the Lethal Weapon series, and although this film may not have been perfect, they shot for a good ending to a great series and I think they suceeded.",

Solid action set-pieces including all the car-chases and fisticuffs you could want, economical inclusion of all of the characters we've learned to love (some perhaps not so much), plus a few new faces enter the fray. Okay, so when things aren't exploding the film feels a little slow and the pacing in general is a little mixed, with action sequences popping up all over the place, and Leo (played by Joe Pesci) was annoying enough without needing Chris Rock screeching beside him. But, Jet Li makes an awesome bad guy, Mel Gibson is still on form even without his trademark mullet, and Danny Glover rocks into old age guns blazing.

Unfortunately, the rest of it has the same problem. \nThe franchise ends on a high note when it comes to set pieces (though it still appears that every car-chase this team has ends with road construction), but realism has long since been abandoned and replaced with marvel and sheer nerd creativity by the drawing board. \nAs for the characters, Gibson and Glover still has chemistry although Donner has made them a little bit closer to cartoon characters for each instalment. Chris Rock is for the most part about as funny as cancer in a puppy, and when paired up with Pesci, it's embarrassingly stressful and unfunny (Pesci's character is more than annoying enough on his own). It would also appear that Donner thinks it's fun to have 3-4 actors screaming incoherently at each other every 16 minutes for comedic effect. Needless to say this stopped being funny many Lethal Weapons ago. \nThe banter of Russo and Gibson came off sexy and light-hearted with a comic edge in the third instalment, but is short in all those departments this time around, with a few fun exceptions. \nThe gags are steam-rolled all over and though there are some great hits, one would expect that by the fourth instalment they would know how to hit a bullseye 8 times in 10 instead of 8 in 100. \nThis goes for sidetracks as well. This film takes many sidetracks in story or to include (new) characters. Again quantity gets the better of quality. All-in-all the pace of this movie is cranked up way beyond what is healthy and as a result, though you are rarely bored, you are annoyed and weary throughout much of it.

Lethal Weapon might've drifted from the quality of the first two films into something more comedic and that's not a bad thing. The franchise grew from the central plot element of the first two films, Riggs was unstable and was looking for an easy way out. This fourth film closes this long standing storyline with the ending and I feel this is as close to an ending as you can get. There is talk of a fifth, but if they were to do it, it needs to be a passing of the torch for the next generation. The film lacked a worthwhile villain, much like the last film. The last two films are more set piece created and the quality of the film drifts away. I enjoyed this film and the third, but they are no way near the quality of the first two films. The characters evolved and that's the most interesting side of this film. Great action and fun. 15/12/2019",

This is immediately evident when after an unexplained and pointless - though admittedly action packed - intro that has nothing to do with the film (remember the starts of 1, 2 & 3 were all related to the plotline that followed) featuring a Ned Kelly styled psycho with a flamethrower, the imminent arrival of not one, but two babies is announced.\r\n\r\nAhhh babies, the sure-fire signal that a franchise is bereft of new ideas.\r\n\r\nBut for the most part in LW4 that doesn't even matter, why invent new ideas when the old ones still work just fine?\r\n\r\nThe usual suspects are still around, Leo (Joe Pesci) is now a private eye, still irritable, yappy and profance. Riggs kept a woman alive for two films in a row, and now Lorna (Rene Russo) is one of the preggers chickies along with Roger's eldest daughter Rianne who ignored her own condom ad and got knocked up by a young loud mouthed cop named Butters (Chris Rock), who seems to be there to be a similarly abrasive counterpoint to Leo and to create a dumb running joke where Roger thinks he is gay for him.\r\n\r\nAs always the case comes to them, this time it is a people smuggling operation lead by villainous Chinese criminals, after it is busted open the 400+ are sent back; but not a dozen or so that Roger decides to keep for himself in some kind of 'free the slaves' arrangement. This ludicrous turn of events only gets worse when he decides to keep them all in his home. What exactly did he plan to do with them??\r\n\r\nDoesn't matter, because in a stroke of luck this one family is the main one the smugglers actually wanted to get into the country (why the other 400 odd then?), and they head to Roger's house to claim them. (I've said it before, everyone knows where Roger lives).\r\n\r\nAfter this the usual stuff happens, Roger and/or Riggs gets pissed and decide that's enough leading to the deaths of countless bad guys and many explosions.\r\n\r\nAnd really that's why Lethal Weapon 4 gets a pass mark from me, the action sequences are almost as solid as ever enough and the pace hectic enough to demand enjoyment, even if by comparison you know that they are merely going through the motions by now.\r\n\r\nThe humour is there but you have to look a bit harder to sift the good jokes out of the flat and bland ones - the Leo / Butters dynamic was supposed to be hilarious... at least I think it was - there is one good freeway chase, one good hand to hand combat scene where Jet Li finally gets to show how much better he is than any of the good guys and the final shootout and fight is OK.\r\n\r\nI would've been happy if it had of ended when the bad guy died - but noooooo - they had to force in an indulgent 'everyone loves each other' montage that spilled over into the cast and crew. Maybe as a DVD extra guys, but a sappy way to close out a 4 film series where most of the fun was found in potty talk and head counts.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 7 / 10. Lethal Weapon had a strong enough formula that even the duds were ok, this pales in comparison to 1 and 2, but if it's on late night TV I'd probably find myself hanging around till the end, at least the logical end before the mutual back-slapping parade.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 500 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

Joe Pesci and Chris Rock are bad in this, and it's surprising to have Pesci be annoying as hell here because he was terrific in Goodfellas and Raging Bull. Lethal Weapon 4 is one of the worst action films that I've seen.  Lethal Weapon 4 is a blunder and doesn't work half the time. The fm is entertaining, but it feels so tonguie in cheek like I said it losses the fire to make it a truly memorable action film. The acting I thought  was mediocre and it's not one of the best films with Mel Gibson. For me The Mad Max films and the first Lethal Weapon and Braveheart are his best performances, but in this film he falls flat. The best way to summarize Lethal Weapon 4 is that it's a mediocre fourth film that scraps the bottom of the barrel. The film could have been good, and there was some entertaining parts, but it wasn't enough to redeem the poor final product that is this film.",

The Story this Time evolves around a group of Chinese Mafia Guys who wants to illegal Immigrate Chinese Guys into America to get cheap Workers. The Story isn't that original but she gives a good setting for a Action Filled Movie with Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Chris Rock and Jet Li. This 4 are the Main Characters (for me) and the best Characters in the movie. All in all the characters are all really good and the Actors are fitting their role. The Action is really cool and mostly the Hand to Hand Fights are good to look at. Best Fight were the Endfight between Jet Li and Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and the Fight in the House of Roger. The Effects are good but the Explosions are a bit too much. I really love the Score of the hole Series it's really calm and good to listen. The Gags are really good this Time. I love it when they do their Running Gags like the Count to 3 rule or something like that. But with Chris Rock they have a real Comedy Expert on hand and he does some good Jokes. All in all I must say that Lethal Weapon 4 is the best of the Franchise. If it's the easy to understand but well told story or the really good fitting Characters or the cool action and the good Gags. Everything fits and thats awesome. For Fans of the Series or Action Movies or mainly Movies it's a must see.",

Here, every character plays a vital role in the plot's development.\n\nThe makers here also can't be accused of running out of ideas; we get it, there's bad guys doing bad things and you can't play with that formula too much or else you lose vital cannon fodder. Aside from that, giving the characters more at stake with juggling the demands of their subplots and the inherent themes of aging and fatherhood is handled properly with each character reacting to their situations as you'd expect with cheapening their well crafted characterizations.  In fact, by the end, it's easy to feel that the movie could have gone on longer, but fortunately the keen eye of the editor sees the proceedings moving along at a brisk pace without too much fluff.\n\nFans of the series should come away pleased, and as someone who saw this first without seeing the others, neophytes are likely to backtrack and gain interest in the previous installments.

The story was interesting(All though a little ho-hum)the action was what got me(Nothing against Mel Gibbson LOVE his Acting)But the actors where just TOO OLD for the fight scenes. it looked weird and some what sad seeing Mel Gibson getting his ass kicked by Jet Li.\r\nI am glad though they ended ended the series with this and am glad that they didn't make the story TOO outlandish.\r\n\r\nHaving said this though this is,IMO, one of the funnier Lethal weapons. The addition of Chris Rock AND Joe Pesci make this a hilarious film,I always loved their scene where they argue about the cellphones, And also the other actors have some funny parts too.

Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), they stopped U.S. Army drug smugglers in 1987, corrupt South African Diplomats in 1989, and a ruthless L.A.P.D. officer in 1992. In 1998, they go after Chinese triads, led by a deadly high ranking negotiator name Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li), while dealing with personal problems in the fourth and final installment to the Lethal Weapon trilogy. With them again is the always irritating Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), who is now a private investigator. Sgt. Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), who is pregnant with Riggsâ first child. And a newcomer: the serious but loudmouth L.A.P.D. Sgt. Lee Butters (Chris Rock). This was the 1st Lethal movie I ever heard. I was nine years old when it came out that summer; my parents went to see it while my brother and I went to see SMALL SOLDIERS. There were some great moments like when Riggs chasing one of the thugs through Chinatown, the freeway chase, and the infamous dentist scene. The most intense sequence would have to be the climax between the boys and Li. Speaking of Jet Li, whoâs one of Hong Kongâs biggest stars at that time; this was his first American movie was kind of creepy in his performance. In an interview he did while filming, he said Heâs big fan of the Lethal Weapon films and was happy to be a part of it. I would have to say that LETHAL WEAPON 4 is the most intense and most entertaining one Iâve ever seen. THE LETHAL WEAPON movies ARE ACTION MOVIE CLASSICS AND YOU WILL LOVE THEM!",

The biggest thing is that 3 was enough for me, and I think this one is good enough to give a passing rating, but I tend to only watch the first three.",

There is definitely more comedy here than there was in the first two films, but this suits the tone of the film and doesn't detract from the brutal fight scenes.  Jet Li is an interesting choice for the villain, mostly because he's completely out of Riggs and Murthaugh's league in terms of hand-to-hand combat, and thus remains very threatening when he appears on-screen.

I don't see why anybody wouldn't like \"Lethal Weapon 4\" because it's everything most people would expect it to be. It has a lot of fast paced action, good special effects, and a lot of laughs. What made \"Lethal Weapon 4\" one of the best two of the series in my opinion is the comedy that's in the movie. Without a doubt, it has more comedy in it than the other three movies in the series by far. Some of the funniest parts are when Joe Pesci makes friends with a shark, and the laughing gas scene at the dentist's office. Like always, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover put on great performances, and Joe Pesci is hilarious. I'm not crazy about Chris Rock's stand up comedy show, but he was actually pretty good in this movie. Jet-Li also shows off some of his awesome fighting moves at times in the movie.\r\nIf you like movies with a lot of action and a lot of comedy, I recommend getting \"Lethal Weapon 4.\" NOTE: That was my Amazon review from the year 2000. This or 2 is the best LW. My rankings: LW4, 2, 1, 3",

That said, the action does get stirred up with the addition of Jet Li, and there's considerably more peril involved for the two families (three, if you count the Chinese family), and some surprising deaths towards the satisfying main-story climax.  \r\n\r\nLethal Weapon 4 could have been much worse, and a lot of people probably didn't know what to think of a fourth installment (this at a time when fourth movies weren't common outside of the horror genre), but a lot of its success could have contributed mightily to the explosion of fourth films that started to spring up out of old franchises (still waiting for Back to the Future 4).

Yeah yeah I know, probably should take a lot of heat for liking a sequel more than the original, but I don't really care. \nLethal Weapon was serious, Lethal Weapon 2 was serious with a comedic relief, Lethal Weapon 3 was a comedy, and Lethal Weapon 4 managed to find a balance of comedy and action that pretty much destroyed 3. \nLethal Weapon 4 manages to contain over the top action sequences, but still manage to bring a certain realism to its choreography. One of the biggest problems I have with modern action/comedy mixes is the fact that our heroes are always blundering idiots that win by accident. Take Rush Hour 2, when Chris Tucker fights Ziyi Zhang, he falls over, knocking a blade accidentally into his attackers shoulder. I could go on and on, but I won't.\nWith this movie though, Riggs is still a bad ass, trained soldier who just manages to get bested by a superior combatant (Jet Li), making for fights that convey a sense of struggle and realism. \nAlso, Lethal Weapon 4 hits a vibe with characters that just makes it insanely fun to watch. The opening action sequence, which has Riggs and Murtough fighting a heavily armored man wielding a flamethrowing and an assault rifle, is full of hilarious dialog and a sense of danger that just makes it unique in its own way.\nPlus, ya know, it gains a bit of bonus points because Mel Gibson doesn't have a mullet in this one. \nEither way, if you're looking for a really enjoyable film with some pretty good action, check out Lethal Weapon 4. If you want something darker and more serious, watch 1 or 2. Ignore 3.",

            "content": "Who said all movie series become worse with every installment? Lethal Weapon 4 is probably the best fourth movie in a series ever. I find it incredible that the magic is still there. The main characters still feed of each other and their friendship (both on set and off set) is clearly felt in every scene they have together. Mel Gibson has finally laid the ghost of his wife to rest and is as chipper as ever. He does this without seeming truly obnoxious (even though that is a part of his character). In fact he seems more likable in this film than he did in all the previous films. Danny Glover reprises his role from the previous movies and that is not a bad thing because the Murtaugh role is the best of his career. Rene Ruso returns in her part and although it has been cut down considerably its still a decent role. Joe Pesci is also back and this time around he gets to add some depth to the character (something that was missing in the previous film). Chris Rock is decent. He isn't much of an actor but he is pretty funny and fresh. His part also adds a little something to the all-round comedy of the film, but if you want to know what it is you will have to watch the movie yourself. Jet Li is the villain in this movie and while he is the weakest villain in the series acting wise, he is definitely the most menacing.\n\nThe action is still brilliant despite the fact that the actors are getting older. The story is decent for a fourth film and the overall execution is brilliant. I actually prefer this film to the second and third of the series because I find it to be more entertaining overall. It cuts down on the seriousness (even though its still there) and adds a lot to the comedy and this is a very good choice.\n\nAll in all an excellent film. Highly recommendable for all fans of action movies and the series in particular.",

Gone is the mullet and youthful vigor from ol' Mel but that doesn't make him any less enthusiastic or effective as Riggs, who's age is cleverly integrated into the story as is his imminent fatherhood and will-he-won't-he marriage to Rene Russo's Lorna. It completes a fascinating character arc from the quite different Riggs we met in the first film. The villains - including Jet Li making his western debut - are a step up from the bland LW3 lot but we do have to suffer Chris Rock who's basically playing himself. The action is still impressive including the awesome freeway chase and all in all it's safe to say the series signed off in style, since it appears the chances of a part 5 are sadly slim to none.",

After a wild gunfight against a group of Chinese men who were on the freighter, it is discovered that the freighter is full of illegal Chinese immigrants. As Murtaugh sulks over what is left of his now sunken yacht, he discovers a hidden Chinese immigrant family and their patriarch, Mr. Hong, and decides to take them in. At the police station, Detective Ng expresses his belief that Chinatown crime boss Benny \"Uncle Benny\" Chan is behind the smuggling. Sergeant Lorna Cole of the Internal Affairs Division is unable to help out on the case because she is pregnant with Riggs's baby, and Murtaugh's daughter Rianne is also pregnant. Helping Riggs, Murtaugh, and Leo on the case is Sergeant Lee Butters, the father of Rianne's baby. Wah Sing Ku, a leader in the Chinese Triads, is angry about the disappearance of the Hong family, the family Murtaugh took in, and Wah Sing Ku and the triads are the most dangerous enemies that Riggs and Murtaugh will ever face together. Wah Sing Ku and his men show up at the Murtaugh house, take the Hongs, and set the house on fire with Riggs, Lorna, Murtaugh, Rianne, Murtaugh's wife Trish, Murtaugh's other daughter Carrie, and his son Nick inside. Unknown to Wah Sing Ku, little Ping, the youngest member of the Hong family, was left behind in the house. Ping frees Riggs, who frees the others. Later, when Riggs, Murtaugh, Butters, and Lorna discover that Wah Sing Ku has killed Mr. Hong, Mr. Hong's uncle, and Uncle Benny Chan, Roger takes it very personally because Hong and Hong's uncle were killed.",

I think a large part of that is because I saw the movies one after the other so it was easier to see the progression. I saw the four movies as more of a whole as opposed to seeing them as individual films. So, in a way, this felt like a series finale to a great TV show. And my God, does it deliver. The opening scene was great, the villains were fucking awesome (Jet Li like a MUH-fucka!), the dialogue was laugh-out-loud hilarious and the numerous homages and callbacks to the previous films were an excellent touch. Plus Rianne got her long hair back and looked gorgeous, Riggs had a new haircut but still looked badass and they stopped trying to make Leo hip and just let him be Leo. Joe Pesci is fucking awesome simply because this character is so different from his other characters. I've always known him as a badass who'd fuck up guys twice his size but here, he lets Gibson and Glover be the badasses. Also, knowing that this was Pesci's last movie (fuck 'The Good Shepherd'), that fucking froggy speech was a helluva way to go out. I almost teared up since it was not only well-written and well-acted, it reminded me of the scene in LW3 and just brought a tremendous close to the series. The scenes at the hospital can be the epilogue for all I care cause this movie ended at the graveyard for me. I also dug the addition of Chris Rock, who's funny as a motherfucker and actually sold me as a cop. He didn't have to do much action but I dug his presence in the film. I liked that they brought back everyone, too, including Rene Russo, who doesn't get to do much here but still had her moments. Finally, the reason I love this movie more than the first one was because of the final fight between Riggs, Murtaugh and Jet Li. I know everyone loves the fight between Riggs and Joshua in the first one but I fucking loved this fight more. Everything about it was perfect. The way it was shot with the rain pouring down, the conversation Riggs and Murtaugh had when they decided to fight Jet Li, Riggs pushing Murtaugh back before attacking first, the way the two of them caught Jet Li in mid-kick together and pushed him down, the callback to Riggs' dislocated shoulder and my favourite shot in the whole film where Riggs and Murtaugh walk towards Jet Li, cross over and switch sides and then lightning just flashes as the two of them stand in front of Jet Li knowing they're in for a fucking fight. As a huge fan of 'Angel' and it's series finale, it just reminded me of the last scene in 'Not Fade Away' and put the whole 'Lethal Weapon' series in perspective for me. Just an excellent fucking ending to a fun, enjoyable and memorable series of films. I fucking loved it.",

I guess we should've seen that coming, what with the death of Riggs' mullet (we hardly knew ye!)\n\nIt's business as usual, with Riggs and Murtaugh dealing with encroaching old age whilst finding another internationally-based crime syndicate to deal with (the odd-numbered films are domestic threats, and the even films are foreign.  Strange but true.)  All the series regulars who've managed to survive turn up, with the addition of Chris Rock as Murtaugh's secret son-in-law - who of course, is painted by Riggs as a...well, let's say he's looking for the sort of relationship with Murtaugh that you might find in 5th-century BC Athens.  There.  That's as clearly as I'm going to say it, so you might as well get out there and do the research yourself.\n\nWatch for:  the battle with the robo-crook at the beginning, for the sheer destruction and the fact that Murtaugh subdues him by chicken-dancing in his underwear (Riggs is such a jerk).  Riggs' continual prankstering finally bites him on the rump as the long-suffering LAPD shrink, Dr. Woods lets him have it with all the rage of three-and-a-half movies' worth of being picked on - just when Riggs finally has a legitimate psychological issue to present her (he reverts to being a jerk).  Jet Li pounding the crap out of Riggs, whose martial arts expertise seems to have gone the way of the dodo (little ring-rust, mayhap?  Or forgetful writers?)  Even more explosions than the last one.  Joe Pesci's Leo character finally gets an apology from Riggs.  Riggs finally gets over his first dead wife.  Murtaugh's house gets destroyed AGAIN!  (Four-peat - aww yeah...)\n\nIt's fun and not too difficult to follow.  A good end to a franchise, conducted whilst its principals were still capable of doing so.

The highway chase is great fun to watch.  Ditto the scene in the dentist office.\n\nJet Li plays the villain well as a cold, incredibly uncaring individual.  Seeing how Riggs & Murtaugh figure out how to dispatch him, considering he's probably the most dangerous villain they've faced, is interesting.

Everything seen here was seen in the previous installments, and Warner Bros. just wanted to make a ton of money. Nevertheless, the fourth installment is highly entertaining, and the chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson is still there, but this film has no substance in comparison to the others, and is just a residual reminder of how good this franchise once was.\n\nThis film, however, does get something that the third installment was missing, and that is the presence of an interesting villain. Like the first two films, this one has two villains that hold interest. Jet Li made his American film debut here as a Chinese mercenary named Wah Sing Ku, and I am very grateful that Jackie Chan turned down the offer to play the role. Chan probably wouldn't be near as threatening as Li, who has the moves to take down Glover and Gibson within a few seconds. Kim Chan also gives an enjoyable performance as a Chinatown drug dealer, nicknamed \"Uncle Benny,\" who is working with Ku and the Chinese Triad. Chan is very comical in some of his scenes, particularly one scene in a dentist's office, and he and Li are for more interesting than all of the villains in[i] Lethal Weapon 3[/i].\n\nChanning Gibson's script isn't very high on imperative or intriguing material, but there are some interesing themes that are explored with the Mel Gibson character. In the past films, Gibson's Martin Riggs was seen as suicidal, crazy, on the edge, and reckless. He was nearly unstoppable to all of his adversaries, and he was rarely challenged. He didn't care much about whether he lived or die, but here it is different. He wants to marry girlfriend Lorna (Rene Russo), but he doesn't know how that would affect his love for his deceased wife. Lorna is pregnant with a child, and now Riggs has a lot more to loose. We are also seeing that Riggs is getting older, and like soon to be grand-daddy Murtaugh (Danny Glover), Riggs may simply be \"too old for this shit.\" \n\nOne of the problems with this film is that a lot of the comedy feels forced, though some of it is amusing. Chris Rock joins the cast as Detective Lee Butters, who may have a comedy degree in corronation with his psychology and criminal justice credentials. Joe Pesci is also back as Leo Getz, who doesn't have much of a role in the story until the final moments of the film. He easily becomes an antagonist to Rock's Butters, and Leo figures that he will eventually win over Butters when they have an exchange about shitty cell phone service. While some of the exchanges between Pesci and Rock, as well as Glover and Gibson, are amusing, they often fall flat and feel forced. You know it is a bad sign when Leo Getz starts to become an irritation, and Chris Rock probably has the honor of playing the most annoying character in this series. \n\nThe action scenes in the film are top-notch, and Richard Donner starts the film with plenty of movement. The film begins with Riggs and Murtaugh finding out about Lorna and Rianne's (Traci Wolfe) pregnancy, and that is followed by an explosion with a gas tank. The film then has a gunfire on a ship, and the more interesting action sequences come later in the film. Probably the most volatile scene in the film is when Murtaugh and Riggs are in pursuit of a vehicle, and Riggs finds himself hanging onto plastic from the back of a truck on the freeway. The final confrontation between Ku and Riggs and Murtaugh is top notch, with Ku having the upper-hand despite being out numbered. \n\nIn comparison to the other films, [i]Lethal Weapon 4[/i] doesn't have much of a plot, and the film practically stops three quarters of the way to explain what is going on. Wah Sing Ku is working with Uncle Benny in order to counterfeit Chinese currency, as he has plans to buy back \"The Four Fathers\" from a Chinese general. The Four Fathers were a group affiliated with the Chinese Triad, and one of the members is the brother of Ku. \n\n[i]Lethal Weapon 4 [/i]could of been passed, but it does have some enjoyable moments, and Gibson and Glover still have the chemsitry that made them so great in the first film. Though everything here has been seen before, and has been done better, it's still worth it to check this out, and this film offered an alternative in 1998, as the only other highly marketed action film was Michael Bay's ridiculous [i]Armageddon[/i]. \n  [/color][/size][/font]",
