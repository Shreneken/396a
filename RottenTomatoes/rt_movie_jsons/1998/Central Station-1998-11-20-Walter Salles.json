    "summary": "Bitter former schoolteacher Dora (Fernanda Montenegro) supports herself by taking dictation from illiterate people in Rio de Janeiro who want to write letters to their families and then pocketing their money without ever mailing the envelopes. One day, Josue (Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira), the 9-year-old son of one of her clients, is left alone when his mother is killed in a bus accident. Reluctantly taking him in, Dora joins the boy on a road trip to find his long-missing father.",

However, unbeknownst to her customers, Dora has taken it upon herself to decide which letters are worthy of postage.  When one of her customers dies suddenly, she embarks on a journey with the woman's son to reunite him with his estranged father.  While Walter Salles' film has all the ear markings of sentimental slop, it thankfully never veers into that territory thanks to Fernanda Montenegro's compassionate performance as Dora, some smart writing, and plenty of beautiful cinematography.  The score is a little overwrought at times but that's a small price to pay for such a rewarding journey.",

The spinster is embittered due to her past, the boy is very mouthy due to never having had a father figure in life: neither of both characters loses their quirks throughout the film, although gradually gaining sympathy for each other over time.\n\nThe movie gives off a rather artistic vibe, a style to which the story lends itself more than to any other. Mind my words though: \"artistic\" and \"phenomenal\" aren't synonymous, as this movie contains a handful of flaws, most noticeably in its frame composition. Individually, the cinematography in each shot is appreciable (apart from the scene where the protagonist's mother is killed, which I found to be portrayed VERY amateurishly); sadly, there oftentimes is little cinematographic coherence between different camera angles or scenes, which really takes away from the overall experience. What's more, is that the final quarter of the film seems like it was directed by a wholly different person than the previous three were.\n\nI'd recommend watching this movie because of its story and the uniqueness thereof, albeit pretty appalling concerning cinematography at times.",

Dora is a tough, no nonsense woman and consequently shows Josu\u00e9 no sympathy for his situation, being more concerned distancing herself from anything that tries to penetrate her world. He tries to get her to write a letter to his father, however Dora refuses unless he pays her. The two do end up forming a strained and, at times, volatile relationship, eventually, when Dora feels almost forced into helping Josu\u00e9 after she constantly finds him sleeping rough around the station, where she works. \r\n\r\nIf a road-movie could ever be labelled as \"Epic\", then surely Central Station deserves that very accolade. It's structured almost to perfection, drawing you in through an ever evolving and dramatic storyline. Director Walter Salles, moves the film along a natural and heartwarming path, avoiding the obvious syrupy and sentimental plot traps, which makes the film pleasantly unpredictable and engaging.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest films of the last 20 years.",

            "content": "Ah the Academy. They've made lots of mistakes, everybody knows it. One mistake that gets particular scorn was in 1999, when \"Shakespeare In Love\" beat \"Saving Private Ryan\" for Best Picture. As time as passed, I've realised that \"The Thin Red Line\" is superior to both (Not everyone would agree with that, but at least nearly everyone believes Shakespeare In Love was an undeserving winner). And yet, nobody mentions the other glaring mistakes that year: Ed Norton losing Best Actor, Spielberg receiving yet another Oscar for a rather overrated war film, \"Armageddon\" getting a nomination in any category. Allow me to add another mistake that year: The morally dodgy \"La Vite e Bella\" winning \"Best Foreign Language Film\" among other Oscars (Including Best Actor). I admit that it is a charming film for the first half, but attempting to recreate that charm in the second half inside a Concentration Camp, seemingly betrays the memory of all the people who lost their lives at a time that really should not be used as a backdrop for a comedy routine. So what should have won? Well I haven't seen the other nominees, but they'll have to be pretty damn amazing to top \"Central Station\".\n\nIt seems like a pretty normal road movie: A young boy's mother dies, and he's never met his father. An elderly and lonely woman takes pity on the boy and the two go looking for his father. It could easily turn into sentimental dross with the two slowly developing a love for each other that shines through with everyone shitting rainbows. Fernanda Montenegro (In an Oscar Nominated performance) doesn't let an ounce of sentimentality take over her character, Dora is quite a selfish, morally bankrupt bitch in all honesty: She writes letters and sends them off for people who can't write, yet in her spare time she opens and reads them, judging the people who poured their hearts out to her. There is a battle raging throughout the film: Faith and money, and this battle also takes place inside the soul of Dora. As far as I know, Religion plays an important part in Brazilian culture, but as the country develops, money is becoming more and more important to survive, and the country is becoming a dog-eat-dog world (A really great example of this is early on, when a number of people climb through the windows of a train to grab early seats before the doors open).\n\nSo what of the boy Josue? The young actor portraying him does a pretty good job for the most part, he puts on a tough front but yearns for the love of his father, even if he doesn't always show it. His faith is tested all the time as his journey for his estranged father is always his priority, even though his relationship with Dora is what we focus on for the majority of the film. As is often said, life is about the journey, not the destination, and this is a moving and touching journey where the two don't always get along, cliched set ups are practically non-existant, so the human relationships feel even more real. It's wonderfully shot, and the direction is impressive without being obtrusive, ditto for the soundtrack. Overall, this is a wonderfully moving film, and proof that flavours-of-the-month can take all the Oscars they want, but true film art will live forever.",

Alright it's the only foreign road movie I've ever seen but pretty good nonetheless. \r\n\r\nCentro De Brazil starts out as a complex character study and then after a whole bunch of plot type shit that I don't feel like writing about here (hence the keyword \"review\", not \"summary\") a budding relationship ensues between an old lonely hag from Rio and an orphaned kid as they bounce around from one Brazilian shithole to the next encountering friendly and mysterious strangers. \r\n\r\nSound formulaic? Well it's formulaic as hell which is why I feel generous that it reaps in a whopping seventy percent on my tomatometer. The acting and directing were superb, and at the expense of sounding like a pretentious twat, the movie exuded a kind of warm inspirational glow in the face of all of the misfortunes that the two main protagonists experienced. I felt kind of content seeing vivid camera takes of all of the stray dogs running around rural Brazil all to the beat of some Samba inspired Brazillian pop. \r\n\r\nRemind me to upload the soundtrack to my portable MP3 player.",

The boy dreams of meeting his long lost father, while Dora, with reluctance, helps him to find his father, an thus, embarks on a so-called road trip together. \n\nIt's rare to find a good-written and well-acted Brazilian movie. And here is another gem (if you haven't watched \"City of God\" or \"The Man Who Copied\", you don't know what you are missing). As with what I will say about those movies, I will be repeating the same things about this movie too. Brazilian movies are a different breed. They portray societies' woes vividly. And they portray too, the roses within those thorns. I'm going on and on again....",

While it may have taken flashier, scruffier and more violent efforts to grab the world's attention the birth of a recent generation of talented Latino film makers started here in the 1990s, and this film was what gave the last little push to really start the movement off.\r\nBrazil is perhaps the Southern American equivalent of Bollywood in terms of the amount of films made, with more edgy and darker material than most film industries dared to make, and most movie-going publics found hard to stomach. By the time of the post-modern era, when films were satiring not only their own audiences but their own audience's habits and rituals, there was finally enough freedom to show up real issues without fear of a box-office backlash.\r\n'Central Station' presents the most realistic representation of the Brazillian culture within an ordinary cinematic setting. A world away from the sweltering, swaggering 'Goodfellas'-in-tank-tops of 'City of God', this is a more human and intimate study of a unique culture, one that appears to be even more religiously overt and morally cruel than even the Americans. But to assume that Brazil is full of people who don't care about each other is to be ignorant of both a country and the film's message. The central theme is a need to connect and to communicate, and over the course of the story the main figure of 'Dora' learns to rediscover the necessity of speaking from the heart again.\r\nComing full circle with a little montage of dictation for letters, Dora realises that people do have feelings for each other and do want to be with each other, but it's hard in a country so neglected by its government it barely lifts its head above Third World status. In a society where even writing letters is a laborious chore it's understandable so many lives and hearts are broken because people cannot communicate. The film in itself shows how easily issues can be resolved and mended once the right people meet each other, which perhaps serves as less of a criticism of a mean-spirited people and more an indictment against a totally out-of-touch government.\r\nWe do see a darker side of Brazillian life, namely within the city (Rio being the obvious example.) With a 'police force' shamefully masquerading as a mercenary Gestapo and a seedy underworld of organ trafficking aimed at homeless children, this is a society eating itself alive, giving itself cancer from within; yet another reason to understand why Brazillians can afford themselves little consideration for strangers, such is the danger that is hidden beneath the sundrenched streets.\r\nBut mostly the film is about the triumph of good in a desperate situation, wholly inhabited by two fantastic performances. Vincius de Oliveira's 'Josue' is a heart-breaking role, one of cocky boasts and little innocence, yet with an unimistakble naivety and rawness of emotion. Fernanda Montenegro's 'Dora' is a bitter old crone whose own heart has aged even more than her body, but still retains a pain that somehow connects with Josue's. You'll rarely find an odder couple, but together they have their moments of bonding and love, albiet grudgingly, and with never the pride to admit it. \r\nWith some sumptuous cinematography creating a sleepy, musky atmosphere and a haunting, mellow score, it's a wonderful piece of cinema, a beautiful, extraordinary tale of desire and the need to belong, and the true nature of friendship. It's a shame it never won the big awards it was nominated for, going instead to the more controversial and sentimental 'Life is Beautiful'; 'Central Station' however has enough Latino sarcasm and earthy wit not to wear its heart on its sleeve, but conceal it through dozens of layers of pain, frustration and disappointment. And in that way the film is more than a little frighteningly human.",

It also was kind of a Brazilian travel movie.(Be sure and watch it also!@! ) Central Station is a touching story well done. See part of authentic Brazilian life. Its the story of two people connecting through tragic circumstances. Both their lives are changed. The story spirals downward with bad and worse things happening to the two. How in the end all is saved. A classic case of redemption. The films neo-realism makes interesting fare on their long journey from Rio to the north hinter lands of Brazil. All shot on location a very realistic look at Brazil though the story line is slightly to melodramatic for my taste. The film won me over I am a sucker for Brazilian films. I lived in Bahia Brazil for 8 months in 1975! Como Vai Voce? highest rating Dont miss this one. Five Stars!",

The setting of the plot stimulates the curiosity. The story does not end at they happily living together, but let them seperated. After all, no matter how one longs for the accompany of the other, the virtue of this friendship lies exactly in shining of two hearts in a temporary journey. We are sad but not sentimental; indeed there's more hopeful. And that's the power making this movie so great. The music score is simply beatiful.",

            "content": "CENTRAL DO BRASIL \r\n\r\nCentral Do Brasil(Details here), is a great example of low budget simplistic film making, with some fantastic results. Nominated for awards including two Oscars and a golden globe, this film clearly deserves some recognition and attention.\r\n\r\nDora(Fernanda Montenegro) is a cynical letter writer, who charges for her services to the illiterate in Rio's central train station. When a kid's mother is knocked down and killed, moments after she hired Dora to write a letter, a bond between Dora and the Orphan Josue(Vinicius De Oliveira) forms which leads them to look for his father.\r\n\r\nPerformances here are highly solid all round, with most of the film featuring only the two central characters, their acting can easily hold attention and screen time with a great quality. The characters themselves are highly three dimensional and well conceived, and go through some impressive development which is all justified within the movie.\r\n\r\nThe direction shows how a camera can be used simply to achieve something great. Simplistic tracking shots or stationary camera shots are used mostly, taking careful note of framing and the elements within the shot, rather than the motion of it. The shooting on location makes for realistic viewing which enhances the overall story.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the film, there is a definitive emptiness in relation to the whole film. Some moments of the movie are too slow and fail to reach the quality they could, however there is a strong opening and an amazingly moving and touching ending, which is well worth watching.\r\n\r\nCentral Do Brasil is a well written, superbly performed and masterfully shot piece of cinema. Whilst there are a few scenes that fail to impress, the film on the whole is beautiful and exceptionally powerful, deeply moving the audience. Wonderful stuff!",
