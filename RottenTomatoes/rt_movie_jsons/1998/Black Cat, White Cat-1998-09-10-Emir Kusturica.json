    "summary": "When gypsy grifter Matko (Bajram Severdzan) is abruptly swindled by his own partner, he is unable to pay the large debt he suddenly owes. As an alternative form of payment, Matko forces his adolescent son Zare (Florijan Ajdini) into an arranged marriage with his partner's midget sister, Afrodita (Salija Ibraimova). However, both Zare and Afrodita find the marriage objectionable, and their attempts to escape the situation lead to a series of unpredictable comic escapades.",

As the small time hustlers, their families and connections get's into trouble with more successful gangsters things get into a real farce. Poverty and the constant search for cash is important here. So is the value of family and love.\n\nThere is comedy involved everywhere, among the characters and their choices especially. The gypsy setting makes it even more interesting - all that music everywhere, it felt like \"Gogol Bordello\" was in my living room.\n\nIt's lovely shot and it got a very original and fresh look. Very inventing and full of fresh ideas. Still, this was not as good as I was hoping for. Firstly it was way too long. It felt dragged out, since it's plotwise pretty slowly moving. Secondly it was rearly really funny and for the third matter it was a bit safe - it was never dearing enough like a movie like this shold be. A good film, a very memorable one and I'm glad I saw it. I wanted a whole lot more though.\n\n6.5 out of 10 sun flower fields.",

            "content": "Black Cat White Cat - Divine Comedy\nA gangster wiping excrement of his body using a goose..... The same gangster juggling hand grenades and gyrating to a thumping Techno number while being snow blinded silly....\nA pig chewing through an abandoned car, a wraith like Godfather eternally fixated on Casablanca and his custom made wheel chair.... Gypsies, mesmerism, contraband trade, tourines, limos and 'stoned wall' moles...\nConspiracies, serendipity, cultural erosion, brotherhood, true love and forgiveness color this laugh menagerie by Emir Kusturica. \nBlack Cat White Cat bears the same Molieresque drama and the same Shakespearan elements that doff a hat to Kustrica's earlier works like Underground and Time of the Gypsies, but takes its own riotous, rabble rousing  course. \nFor me, the exact gap between familiarity and intrigue was one scene. And it is pretty much Kusturica's genius that wrongfoots the viewer into complacency before a stray element comes along - segueing in, surprising us and walking away in sarcastic victory. \nThe black cat white cat motif is not just a stoic symbol relating to a few characters in the film. Kusturica develops this symbol with the ever changing tone of the film. If at one point the cats are being cursed, at another they become the vehicles of rebirth. If at one point they indulge in sprite like mischief, at another they become important witnesses in an impromptu wedding aboard a rebel sail boat. \nBlack Cat White Cat is a director's movie: to the hilt. Whether it is the amazing range of performances, the technical fluidity or the writing chops on display, Kusturica exercises amazing control over the varying tone throughout. A myriad issues are dealt with but an overwhelming Joie de Vivre permeates every scene in the film, performed with a wild, kinetic energy. Indeed the spirit is infectious, transporting the viewer effortlessly from pure Surrealism to self mocking humaneness an  finally an awe inspiring charm. \nAt the centre of all this heart-warming bedlam is a cleverly constructed core that gives the film much of its quirkiness. Like the carousel in the film, the plot is structured on seven to eight major scenes varying in tone from insane slapstick to edifying sensuality. Each of the scenarios in turn branches off into various threads, packing in diverse themes and conflicts. Kusturica mixes and matches, stirs and shakes ingredients in such a fashion that leaves one in a razzled state of blood rushed state of sugary indulgence. \n\n\n\nLike many of its contemporaries. Black Cat White Cat is a polemic with a sprawling scope, designed as a Divine Comedy embracing hallowed cinematic idioms. \nThe narrative begins with an illegal barter between a middle aged slacker, Matko and inmates aboard a Russian fuel tanker. On being swindled, Matko hatches a plot to strike diesel supplies on board a Russian train. He seeks the help of a local don, Grga, who we discover owes a moral debt to Matko's father. Matko's indiscretion results in him revealing the plan and in turn being double crossed by Dady (Dayan) a war profiteer and man of means. The scoundrel Dadi also ensnares Matko to pledge his son's (Zare) hand in marriage to Dadi's plain sister, Lady Bug Aphrodita. Zare is in turn in love with Ida, the free spirited granddaughter of a gypsy woman. \nKusturica enriches this simple tableau with idioms that we have come to love, accept and expect from complete movie experiences. Much of what the movie accomplishes is because it achieves what it sets out to do; get us to laugh at a torn nation learning to laugh at its mistakes and past experiences. \nGrga and Matko's dad represent the Old World Order, of say Tito's perhaps. Dadi and Matko represent the noise and confusion of the post Genocide years. Zare and Ida represent the Future - 'in a land with no sun,' as one character puts it. \nEach of these characters undergo a rite of passage - the moribund patriarchs have to literally defy Death, liberate themselves and again court Death in that order - Dadi discovers his in a shit pit and Matko experience his finally after being swindled a third time. \nThe music is worthy of standing on its own merit: Beethoven jostles with river side violinists who contend with drunken wedding bands plastered on clover trees. \nKusturica kicks up a storm with his ensemble of animal performers: the chewing pig. trains of cackling geese, expressive goats and horses to the all pervading harbingers - the black and white cats, and not to forget, a mouse in a rotating wheel. \nI can't think of enough reasons for one to give this film a try....\n-\tPossibly the greatest love making/ seduction scene with not even a hint of physicality involved\n-\tPossibly the finest convergence of Caricature and Psychological sketch, especially in the characters of the frail Patriarchs\n-\tA serendipitious energy that guides almost every character in the film and even the more the audience. Sample this....a midget finds true love in a seven foot giant who with a double set of teeth is \"as elegant as a vampire and has shovels for hands.\"\n\n\n\n-\tThe Black and White cats that appear as Detiny's instruments throughout - right from when they are sneaky intruders to when they are involved in an act of resurrection.\n-\tA pastiche of unforgettable set pieces.....the walking tree stump, the moving gift box, the entire train robbery sequence and every time old boss Grga appears on screen.\nAbout two years ago, I recall an Indian director citing Kusturica as a favorite influence. The occasion was his film being selected for a Cannes screening. I am glad that Kusturica's vision is rubbing off on a generation of progressive Indian film makers. \nOn a wishful detour, I hope that more of my countrymen can experience Black Cat White Cat. It is the perfect film for the average Indian film goer's psyche....\n-\tIt is loud, colorful escapism but it also gives you Intellectual tokens, if you ask.\nBlack Cat White Cat is a sparkling achievement to Kusturica's luminous filmography and a milestone in the rich East European film legacy.",

For example, the gypsy band being tied to the tree and still playing their instruments, the  non-stop presence of geese herds filing in and out of the action, the weird mutation of western progress and especially film influencing the traditional desires of the main characters.
