    "summary": "This dark ensemble-comedy is centered on the three Jordan sisters. Joy (Jane Adams) moves through lackluster jobs with no sense of purpose. Now employed teaching adults, she is dating a student, Russian taxi-driver Vlad (Jared Harris). Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) is an esteemed poet who becomes amused by her perverted neighbor, Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And eldest sister Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) is married to Bill (Dylan Baker), a psychiatrist with a very disturbing secret life.",

            "content": "Ok, so this is probably the darkest comedy I've ever seen. At least in terms of one that was produced with big name players. It's not for the faint of heart, or anyone easily triggered by sexual assault. I didn't love it. It was ok for the most part, but it feels very long, which at just over 2 hours it definitely is. The cast was the best part. Some of the best character actors you'll see, giving great performances. It feels weird, and it is weird, and it was made to be weird. If that sounds appealing to you, maybe you'll like it. I just found it passable personally. 6.75/10",

It's centered around three sisters living in New Jersey \u2013 a social outcast, a successful writer, and a housewife living a seemingly idyllic life. However, nothing seems to be what it appears to be as their lives, to varying degrees, spiral out of control. The cast, which includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Ben Gazzara, among others, dish out their lines with a droll dryness that can be found only in a Solondz film. The script is cringe-inducingly funny, the individual stories are interesting without exception, and the languid pacing allows the viewer to absorb all of the horrors presented.  It is clearly not for all tastes (or most tastes, for that matter), but will be liked by anyone who has an appreciation for the unique stylings of Solondz.",

            "content": "I'm not sure what I'm feeling after watching this film, but it certainly isn't 'happiness'. \n\nA uniquely cynical take on personal satisfaction - personal flaws are presented as essentially universal and a key part of the human identity, but these flaws inevitably prevent each individual from reach their state of 'happiness'. Life becomes a a cycle of aimless wandering, searching for meaning when the characters themselves are actually preventing their own personal development. Everyone is doomed and desperate, struggling for desires that often come from rather immoral or selfish motivations, but each 'sympathetically pathetic' in their total inability to fight back against this natural order that Solondz presents. It's a desolate film, but also totally aware of its capability for dark comedy, relishing in tragic irony as the sole relief in what is otherwise a hell of repression and self-deceit. In short, you'll laugh, but you won't have a fun time.\n\nI like to think that Baker's Bill Maplewood is actually a darkly comic take on Peter Graves' Captain Clarence Oveur from Airplane!; \"have you ever seen a grown man naked?\" (3.5/5)",

            "content": "If we didn't spend our entire lives searching for bliss, we wouldn't have a reason to live.  Happiness is a driving force in humanity - it's the emotion we most eagerly turn to time and time again, after times of anger, sadness, and yes, even happiness.  Once we experience elation, there's never a moment in which we don't want to feel it again.  It's much too addictive to pass up, like an ice cold Diet Coke on an afternoon in mid-July or a cup of hot cocoa following a long winter walk.\n\tBut alas, not everyone is equipped with an endless supply of dopamine - some, unfortunately, are more fruitful in their ecstasy than others.  1998's \"Happiness,\" written and directed by black comedy master Todd Solondz, is about that small percentage of individuals, who either spend their days putting on a happy face in order to be culturally accepted or succumb to their misery.  \n\tA film so downbeat in its storytelling strategies should be unattractive - I'm sure most would prefer to sit through something delightful like \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" - but Solondz isn't the type to drown in his own death wishes a la Michelangelo Antonioni.  He, instead, sees the twisted humor in the widespread suffering of his characters, looking at mini-tragedies such as disappointingly uninterested one-night-stands, unfulfilling work experiences, and joyless sex lives as if they were sitcom tropes.  Imagine one of those funny scenes in a \"Friends\" or a \"Seinfeld\" where someone says the wrong thing, where the wrong character shows up at the wrong time, where the wrong outcome is produced.  This time, though, the comedy isn't bright - it's bruising.\n\tWhat Solondz's goal is is hard to say.  Is he interested in creating a social satire specifically pointing a finger at the white upper-middle class? A character study that focuses on unlucky - some terrible - people who crave contentment but will possibly never find it? Here, we aren't so pressed to find out.  We can only watch in inexplicable hypnotization as we decide whether to laugh, to cry, or to wince.  If we're lucky, maybe we'll experience all three.\n\t\"Happiness\" circles around three sisters, Joy (Jane Adams), Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), and Trish (Cynthia Stevenson).  When we first meet Joy, meek and kind-hearted, she is in the process of dumping a self-pitying loser (Jon Lovitz) who verbally abuses her for not reciprocating his premature love.  Nearing thirty and completely aimless, Joy causes alarm in Trish, a cheerful housewife married to Bill (Dylan Baker), a therapist by day and a child molester by night.  Trish is the kind of woman who believes you won't amount to much if you aren't married and are without kids; Bill is the kind of man smart enough to know what a horrible person he is while still being too stupid to control himself.  Helen, the most successful of the sisters, is a well-off poet tired of the endless praise from love interests, literary critics, and the public.  She craves disappointment, to feel like she isn't good enough for once.\n\tAlso connected to this cast of thoroughly messed up characters are Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a mouth-breathing pervert who tells his therapist (who just so happens to be Bill) of his wildest sexual fantasies but is only confident enough to briefly shout them out to anonymous women on the telephone (two callers just so happen to be Joy and Helen; Helen is also his neighbor); Mona (Louise Lasser) and Lenny (Ben Gazzara), the long-married parents of the sisters whose relationship is shattered after Lenny calls for separation in order to achieve much desired \"alone time\"; and Billy (Rufus Read), Bill and Trish's awkward preteen son more concerned with climaxing for the first time than with any other sort of middle-school based emotional issues.\n\t\"Happiness\" is a challenging film.  Apart from the sympathetic Adams, who has a presence timid enough to make you want to give her a bear hug, the ensemble is comprised of characters not conventionally likable or unlikable; they exist in a middle-ground of average, monstrously selfish one moment and sympathetic the next.  These are people we'd meet on the street, appearing convincingly mild-mannered in the scope of a glimpse.  But once doors close and fears are amplified, they turn into relatable, if not pathetic, connoisseurs of depression, searching for happiness but unsure of where exactly to find it.  \n\tCovering their self-hatred is a visible irony represented by pastel colors and interludes of sitcom-ready orchestral music; when one traumatic scene ends, we can expect Solondz to transition to the next as if a jaw-drop is normal, as if a disturbing confessional is a witty one-liner in disguise.  He is the finest director of black comedy I've ever seen - everything about \"Happiness\" should be dead serious.  And yet, we find ourselves laughing in-between grimaces, a description more literal than any other time I've used it.  \n\tIt's not an easy film, but there's something consuming about the way it explores the underbellies of what's considered \"normal\" in American society; what happens when the all-American dad is actually a serial rapist, when the successful author yearns for unanimous panning that will never arrive, when the 60-something married couple destroys the idea that marriage can last a lifetime by proclaiming boredom? The sly subversion of \"Happiness\" is what makes it such an excellent film - but I can only recommend it to the most cynical of viewers.  Most will be unsure what they should be thinking.  Even I don't know.",

            "content": "Happiness is what I would call a pretty disturbing film, but I mean it in the very best of ways. It examines its subject matter not with violence and hysteria, but with words and behaviour. It was heavily criticised on release due to its controversial themes, but when you attempt to depict a subject matter such as paedophilia, there's no way you're going to do it without upsetting someone. Todd Solondz bravely tackles issues such as loneliness, dissatisfaction, maturity and child molestation head-on, highlighting how they affect both the sufferer and those around them. The acting is fantastic, especially from Dylan Baker. With a sexual attraction to children getting the better of him, Baker portrays his character as restrained and in control, but always on the edge. What's so admirable about the films approach is it doesn't deny that what he's doing is morally reprehensible and has no place in modern society, always showing the damage that he is doing, but it doesn't make it seem like he does it out of a will to cause pain. He's just a man with a sickening compulsion that threatens to destroy him. This storyline is the emotional highlight of the film, but all the others work too, especially when you have master character actor Philip Seymour Hoffman on the cast list. All these characters want is to find their own happiness in an unforgiving world, and the film shows how that can often be a journey paved with misery and ridicule.",

It is equal parts humane drama and cringe comedy, often blurring the two within the same scene. The acting is universally amazing to behold across the board, but the two standouts are Philip Seymour Hoffman and Dylan Baker. Every character has something about them that makes them an engaging, interesting character to follow which means no matter which vignette you're in there will always be something of interest going on. The use of pastel colors and softer music adds an ironic element to the film, with how it's overly sappy trappings belie an inner depression lying just below the surface. One of the most touching movies I've seen in a while, Happiness gets a very strong recommendation.",

Their lives intersect with pedophiles and masturbating prank phone-callers.  \n\nFunny in a pitch-black way and surprisingly moving, the film undercuts our images of happiness and explores the ways in which we perhaps deny ourselves true happiness by denying some basic aspect of our identity or by not accepting other people for who they are. \n\nNot for the squeamish or easily offended, Happiness is independent cinema at its finest: unapologetic, in-your-face, and totally original.",

            "content": "Ahahahaha. Man. This movie is hilarious and bleak. This is one of the darkest dark comedies ever made. There aren't many movies that so forthrightly deal with such disturbing subject matter; and yet, somehow, the movie is very funny. It's hard to say exactly how, as the movie never goes for gags or punchlines and never seems to overtly mock its absolutely wretched characters. And yet it made me laugh, somehow. Perhaps just its willingness to go straight ahead into scenes totally unlike anything ever made before is what made me laugh.\n\nIt's one of those movies with a large ensemble cast and several intersecting plotlines, like Robert Altman's Short Cuts or Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia. At the core of the movie is a group of three sisters. One of the sisters (Jane Adams) puts on a brave face but just cannot seem to find any sort of success, professionally or personally. Another (Lara Flynn Boyle) is a writer who feels like she's a fraud, and is being stalked by her perverted neighbor (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who likes to call random women from the phonebook and masturbate. The third sister (Cynthia Stevenson) thinks she has the perfect little suburban life, but little does she know her husband (Dylan Baker) likes to molest little boys. A few other characters weave into and out of the story.\n\nThis might be the only comedy I can think of that features child molestation, multiple rapes, murder, suicide, masturbation, and very explicit discussions of all of the above. Every time you think, \"No, the movie can't possibly go there,\" it goes there, and then just keeps going and going. It seems impossible to believe this movie was actually funded by anyone, and yet there it is. The acting is all excellent, especially by Hoffman and Baker as two sad, but different, perverts. This is one of the earliest major roles for Hoffman, and shows what an incredible actor he already was before we really knew about him. Baker is incredibly good in this movie, though the nature of his part might make it easier to see why he hasn't been cast in too many starring roles since. Jane Adams is also brilliant here. \nThis is the second film I've seen by Todd Solondz, after the similarly dark and satirical (though less extreme) Welcome to the Dollhouse. It definitely makes me curious to see where he could have possibly gone from here, though I know he does have several other films. On the basis of the two films, Solondz is a solid director and an unbelievably nervy writer, one who genuinely isn't afraid to do anything. This is not a movie I would recommend watching with your family, or anyone else really. But you should still watch it all the same. Also, it has a nice little closing credits song sung by Michael Stipe, so that's a fun bonus.",

The two characters that are by far the most interesting (and the creepiest) are the pedophile, played by Dylan Baker, and the pervert, played perfectly by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Somehow, both characters are given enough humanity that you actually sympathize with them to a certain degree. The entire movie is filled with disgusting people involved in depressing situations in the pursuit of happiness, and needless to say there isn't a single happy thing that happens in the movie. It's definitely too dark and too heavy for a casual viewer, but if you can handle the controversial topics that Happiness explores, then you might find yourself enjoying it.

Unfortunately, her husband develops an unnatural fascination for his 11 year old son's male classmate, fantasizes about mass killing in a park, and masturbates to teen magazines. One of his patients, Allen (Seymour Hoffman) has a fascination for the third sister who desperately wants to be raped. Meanwhile, the apparently stable 40 year marriage of the sister's parents suddenly unravels when he decides he has had enough and wants to be alone. The lives of these people are all connected by the desire for happiness, often from immoral, dark sources. The only situation that seems out of place is the conversation in a diner where a lady admits to Allen about murdering someone. Clearly this is a film not for everyone due to the disturbing subject matters, it's the zenith of the darkest of dark humor.

He makes punchlines out of misery and pedophilia while eventually arriving at a touching and tragic vision of humanity. It is distressing and utterly hilarious at the same time, and the performances across the board are simply fantastic. \n\n\"Happiness\" is an ensemble piece of five different stories, all of which intersect from time to time. The film concerns the lives of several related New Jersey residents--a sexually frustrated professional (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a pedophile psychologist (Dylan Baker), his blissfully delusional wife (Cynthia Stevenson), their 11-year-old son (Rufus Read) who's concerned with his inability to ejaculate, an unhappy older couple (Ben Gazzara, Louise Lasser), and others. Self-centeredness is the chief characteristic of nearly everyone in this film.\n\nAt two hours and 20 minutes,\"Happiness\" rambles a bit, but the strength of these characters is undeniable. The film strongly benefits for thoroughly realized characters and relationships along with Solondz's masterful ability to switch the tone from comic to tragic at the drop of a dime. We experience empathy for the kind of people we would ordinarily feel uncomfortable around. Solondz does not judge his characters, he doesn't excuse them, and he doesn't reduce them to wicked villains or victims. He simply sees them, and he invites us to do the same.",

            "content": "Some people say that controversial films are necessary if it's a story that must be told. This isn't one of those films. Lacking anything redeemable, this film is an exercise in futility.\n\nSeemingly going through the motions only, the story builds zero empathy. Having antagonistic characters in the role of protagonists doesn't make them more relatable, it makes them seem disconnected. The point that writer/director Todd Solondz is trying to make is apparent, it just doesn't work.\n\nSolondz is trying to push our buttons. He's trying to make us realize there are bad people out there, not in the shadows, but living among us. Of course we all know this, but the degree this film goes to make that point comes across as painfully labored.\n\nBill Maplewood, played by Dylan Baker, is an uptight shrink and part time pedophile. He has a seemingly idyllic life: Successful career, loving wife, great kids. All the trappings of milquetoast suburban bliss have been achieved. If not for the image of him in his car jerking off to a teen magazine, we'd think he was Dick Van Dyke. \n\nWhat's going on is comically obvious, but the script relentlessly tries to raise the stakes with a character that we've taken no emotional investment in. It doesn't work. The deliberately awkward (and numerous) conversations with his preteen son about the birds and the bees are hackneyed at best, depraved at worst. \n\nThe fact that these conversations keeps popping up serves no purpose. By the time he has a tearful confessional with his son, we're over it. Yet another awkward conversation with his son, about the penis, has lost all meaning by this point. A tearful confessional with his wife would have been much more rewarding, but this film seems to deliberately avoid rewarding the viewer.\n\nBill is just one of the emotionally bankrupt characters in this piece. Allen, (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a prank-calling masturbator who's apparently incapable if communicating with any other human beings. Eye contact and conversation are foreign concepts to this introverted shut-in who stalks his neighbor. \n\nAt one point, the neighbor (Lara Flynn Boyle) seems to enjoy his filthy, anonymous phone calls. Then, using the tired cliche of the horny and lonely middle-aged woman, she turns the tables and begins to stalk him. A meeting finally takes place and once again, nothing happens. Just more awkwardness. This film thrives in it.\n\nOf course there are many other characters that this film inelegantly tries to tie together in a bizarre love trapezoid. That's right, all the story-lines are linked... needlessly. \n\nThe shrink's wife is the sister of the horny neighbor, whose other sister is a peckish and shy wallflower, whose parents are splitting up. Any kind of backstory or explanation isn't even attempted. Apparently, they live miserable lives just because that's life. Hence the ironic title, \"Happiness.\" Get it?\n\nI'm curious as to how this film garnered so much acclaim. This seems to be one of those films that critics claim to like only to not be labeled as uptight. The thought process being that a good review means you are one hip and groovy film critic. \n\nNormally, I myself would be tempted to look at a film such as this and applaud it for making us face the ugliness that's all around us. There's something noble about addressing our fears and pushing boundaries. However, there has to be something even slightly compelling or endearing in order to make that possible. Unfortunately, this film lacks either of those qualities.",
