This is a funny but also depressing story about the holocaust and I 100% think you should watch it. It takes a while for the story to get going but it is such a classic movie about the holocaust. It's in my top 10. If I could I would give it 1,000 stars but I can only give it 5.",

            "content": "Benigni operates at (a minimum) 2x speed than everyone else in the film. After Guido's (Benigni) first gaff — rushing his uncontrollable car through a welcome party for the Italian dictator while fashioning a \"Roman Salute\" while telling them to move out of the way — I was concerned that my fond memories of this movie from high school Italian class were more nostalgic than substantive. Luckily, my concerns were quickly assuaged and the more time I spent with Guido, the more I adored Life is Beautiful. Set in a small Tuscan city, there is nothing that would identify the Jewish minority from everyone else. Guido and his uncle (Giustino Durano) do not attend Synagogue (there is no Synagogue in the movie), or wear yarmulkes or seem to adhere to any dietary restrictions. However, as I write this, it strikes me that the scene where Guido, during his first shift as a waiter in a posh restaurant, hints at his religion when he doesn't know how the lobster is supposed to be prepared. That being said, it is Uncle Eliseo, who is also Jewish and the main target of anti-Semitic harassment and crime from gentile youth, who corrects him. Guido makes innocent, slap-stick gaffes during his stay in town, but beneath the surface, something is bubbling, which he recognizes, but approaches with humor. Even when Guido first arrives in Arezzo, his uncle's home is being ransacked by anti-Semitic young men, which Eliseo shrugs off as \"it could happen to anyone\". But the descent becomes harder to ignore as his horse is painted in anti-Semitic graffiti, Guido's store being labeled \"A Jewish store,\" the new school lessons concerning the \"superior races,\" and the random \"questionings\" from local government officials — first Italian lackeys, then Nazis themselves. Any hope that Guido, his son, Giosuè (Giorgio Cantarini), and non-Jewish wife, Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), are going to escape the impending doom is nixed when the trains roll in. You can't help but tell them to JUST LEAVE. Go to America, Canada, Australia, as far as you possibly can, but you know it's not that easy. Critiques of the film claim it trivializes the darkness of the Holocaust. I couldn't disagree more. The film portrays fatherhood and the triumphant human spirit in the presence of certain death. Giosuè, a young child, tells his father that he doesn't want to take a shower with the other children and fled, even against his father's commands. As the viewer, you know that \"showers\" are gas chambers, and innocent, adorable Giosuè narrowly avoided death. While Dora and Guido never see each other while in the concentration camp, he pulls stunts that could easily lead to his execution if caught, like playing their shared opera song over the loudspeakers a la The Shawshank Redemption — if this scene didn't make you feel something, seek a therapist. Even when you think they are going to reunite during the chaos of the approaching Allied forces, your hopes are dashed. I had completely forgotten — and likely didn't appreciate — the Dr. Lessing (Horst Buchholz) character and his role in the plot? What more do you need to lose your faith in humanity? I mean, you got Schindler's List four years earlier. You've already recovered from that? It was, however, the final scene with Guido and Giosuè all these years. It's brilliant and heartbreaking. Even with Edward Norton (for American History X) and Tom Hanks (for Saving Private Ryan) being nominated in the same year, I'm more than happy that Roberto Benigni won the Oscar. Everyone should see this movie (and should again if the last time was during High School Italian).",

I kind of respected the father for trying to make light of such a serious situation and I did find myself giggling at times, although it did feel somewhat wrong to do so. This is very much a thought provoking watch - a film I'd definitely recommend, though the only thing that spoilt it a bit was that some of the things that happened, people bumping into other people and people managing to get to certain places, seemed a little unlikely frankly but for the most part its a pretty decent film.",

At the time people were won over by its charm and humour, and its willingness to tackle such heavy subject matter. But people have taken issue with its dealing with the holocaust in such a seemingly flippant and comedic manner. I can understand those complaints, but I was just interested to see a movie about this horrific event that was taken from a different angle. Children are often peripheral characters in this kind of story, but because a child is centre stage this time, it makes sense for the film to have a different spin. The idea of using comedy and fanciful storytelling to guide a youngster through a tragedy was really fascinating, and I think the film did it in a sensitive way, never going too silly or ridiculous. Your enjoyment of the film will largely rest on how much of Roberto Benigni's hyperactive motormouth schtick you can handle, because he talks, gurns and bounces around a whole lot. There's moments where you might actively want to slap him, or you'll wonder aloud why none of the other characters have done so. At any rate, I think there's lot to enjoy and admire in what Benigni has done, crafting a film that's indebted to real survival stories, as well as the life of his own father, and serves as a testament to the ability of the human soul to triumph in times of tragedy.",

            "content": "Several critics attempted to shoot down Life is Beautiful upon release for what they considered to be an unrealistic and disrespectfully lighthearted take on subject matter that should only be spoken of in hushed tones of muted horror. However, this classic starring, directed, and co-written by Roberto Benigni is not intended to be a reaffirmation of the many other solemn Holocaust films that predated it but to play off them, using the massive human tragedy as a contrast against the strength of familial love and the use of levity as a means of coping with otherwise unfathomably dark circumstances. It's not sentimental fantasy as much as it is a poignant display of the resiliency of the human spirit and parental affection, the casual displays of humor and sarcasm used on a daily basis refocused and magnified in response to an external threat. Benigni does an excellent job channeling the slapstick humor of the early sound film era, demonstrating the superficial charm of his silliness and then compounding it with more dramatic turns. \n\nFar from the 'disprespectful' film that some have decried it as, Life is Beautiful is still a sweet (and bittersweet) tale of romance and affection told in one of humanity's darkest hours.

            "content": "This movie was written and directed by its star, Robert Benigni. The movie is almost two different stories, one a fanciful falling-in-love story as Guido (Benigni) meets and woos the previously engaged Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). Set in 1930's Italy, their relationship is whimsical, charming and extremely lighthearted. Once they acknowledge their love for each other, the film jumps ahead several years after they are married and have a young son. They are soon rounded up by the invading Nazi forces and sent to a concentration camp. The film's second act is the story of Guido as he does all he can to protect the innocence of his son, Giosue, through lies and tall tales about what is actually transpiring.\nI absolutely loved this film, though there were a couple times that Guido's comical actions against the backdrop of the camps felt somewhat uncomfortable. But for me, the story transcended this discomfort. While Benigni was delightful, I found Nicoletta Braschi spellbinding. Her ability on several occasions to say so much, without uttering a single word, was magnificent.",

            "content": "I was all too aware of Roberto Benigni's infamous Academy Awards acceptance speech before watching this strongly divisive comedy concerning the holocaust. One of the few foreign films to crack the Best Picture lineup I had looked forward to seeing this film as the other nominees were rather staid American films such as Saving Private Ryan (1998) or British costume dramas such as Elizabeth (1998) that lack any depth beyond lavish costumes and sumptuous visuals. Sadly I must say that I was rather disappointed as the humor became rather irksome far too quickly and the film does fail to grapple with the very serious issues it chooses to touch upon. A film like Schindler's List (1993) could be faulted for feeling too self important but at least that movie dares to actually engage with the real impact that this horrific event had on Jewish people.\n\nGenial aspiring restaurateur Guido Orefice, Roberto Benigni, happens to be Jewish and faces severe consequences as World War II breaks out and anti-Semitism is rife. Before he is forced into a concentration camp against his will he romances schoolteacher Dora, Nicoletta Braschi, who eventually submits to his romantic wooing despite his uncouth appearance. They quickly have an adorable young son Giosue, Giorgio Cantarini, whom Orefice lies to while in the camp as he claims that everybody is involved in a game that he will be able to win if he earns enough points. It becomes clear as time goes on that Orefice is unlikely to survive as he attracts the ire of Nazi soldiers and an increasing number of Jews are killed as the conflict grows worse. Orefice's final act is saving his son as he is tragically murdered while Giosue survives and is saved by Americans who arrive to liberate the Jews who have been captured.\n\nWhere the film should grab you is by the heart as we are clearly meant to be charmed by the love story between the bumbling but sweet Orefice and the quite lovely object of his affection. Sure, Benigni and Braschi have a pleasant chemistry but the various lengths that our protagonist goes to in order to capture her attention does not seem believable considering how tepid the chemistry is between them in early scenes. Part of the problem is that the film is so heavy on Benigni while Braschi is somewhat of a manic pixie dream girl as our understanding of her attraction to Benigni never goes further than her befuddled facial expressions or sudden escape from her group of upper class friends. It would help if we knew something about her beyond the fact that she is physically attractive, has a nice disposition and loves the man that directed the film. The film also fails to engage because the jokes, especially during this section of the film, just aren't particularly funny. The slapstick and Benigni's humorous asides while courting his love interest don't inspire laughter in the audience and come across as trying far too hard. All in all this is probably the part of the film that works best despite all it's flaws because Benigni and Braschi are likable presences despite the subpar material they work with.\n\nDuring the second half the film really starts to sag as we can no longer overlook the ample flaws of the film with the jerky humor now applied to a major issue. Morally, I think it should be acceptable to make light of serious issues as Charlie Chaplin did so brilliantly with The Great Dictator (1940) but it takes a great artist to do so and Benigni may not be that. We are meant to see how great this man is for ingeniously using humor to distract his son from the horrors occurring around him and this bittersweet combination is surely meant to elicit tears from the audience but I was left unmoved. Perhaps it was because from the outset I never quite believed in these characters, the film is the Benigni show and everybody else falls away. His wife and child are ideas and not people so their loss does not devastate us and even when the only fully formed character in the film dies we do not care about the grief of those left behind. A better film would have allowed us to emotionally invest in these characters before having one of them killed off.\n\nNot nearly as brilliant as it was heralded as being in 1998 this film has lost much of it's shine over time and didn't draw me in with it's syrupy sentimentality.",

A true clown at heart, Benigniâ\"who deserved his Oscars, and probably another for Best Picture, to bootâ\"strikes the perfect delicate balance between heavenly love and hellish brutality, like Chaplin before him employing buffoonish slapstick to ridicule the even more idiotic posturing of fascism. Why only treat evil seriously, when often the power of evil lies in precisely a complete lack of humor, an inability to take a joke (see: Obama mocking Trump), and a oh-so-serious-and-rational egoism? Rather than inadvertently ceding terms to the solemnity of the Blackshirts and angry young men, bowing to the power of hate as the film drops to its proverbial knees to rend its shirt in mourning, what Benigni does is far more radical, standing up to their violence by standing apart from it, refusing to acknowledge its terrible strengthâ\"a fantasy, no doubt, as Zizek has pointed out (http://www.lacan.com/zizekholocaust.htm), but better than the fantasy that we might ever properly mourn the slaughtered victims. Rather than simply making this the tragic tale of survivors who barely escape the nightmare machinery of genocide, Benigni locates survival in the heart of death itself, signifying that one can be a survivor despite (by rejecting) the horrors, not only because of them. In doing this, the film ultimately exists a repudiation of Adornoâ(TM)s famed lament that there could be âno poetry after Auschwitzâ?â\"for what Benigni does is precisely to find poetry *within* Auschwitz, dealing a blow to fascism like few other films before it.",

Even the dialogue became more smart and touching. And let's not forget the beautiful cinematography, and Nicola Piovani Oscar-winning score.\n\n(8.5/10)",

            "content": "In his Italian Comedy/Drama film, Life is Beautiful (Italian: La vita è bella), Robert Benigni tells the story of a Jewish father, Guido, who protects his little child, Giosué, from the horrors of the Nazis with all that he has left: his wild yet colorful imagination. To protect his son from the harsh reality, Guido instead creates for him a false reality, in which the concentration camp they are in is instead a game. In the game Guido makes up, the rules are simple: Giosué has to do everything that helps him survive the camp. It is the combination of Guido's sense of humor, Giosué's fondness of tanks -the winner's alleged prize-, and most importantly, Giosué's innocence, that makes this \"game\" work, saving Giosué's life. Life is Beautiful is a film that uses comedy to symbolize parental love and devotion. Not only that, but it is also a film that works at both formal and contentual levels, transgressing boundaries of all sorts: temporal, mental, and ideological.\nThe brave but inevitably mortal Guido dies protecting his family, however, his sacrifice never dies, both in his son's memory of him -as long as he lives- and eternally in the film, which is a tool that transcends mortality. The film employs voice-over of the adult Giosué in the beginning and in the end of the film recalling his father's \"gift\" to him. This indeed shows that Guido's investment in his son made a lasting impact in his son's life that transcended his own existence. That is to say, the boundary of mortality, or more appropriately the architecture of death, is indeed transcended through the film, which is not something that could be done outside the frames of cinema. Another boundary that the film crosses is the architecture of confinement. Half of the film was shot in a concentration camp where elderly Jewish citizens and Jewish children get executed while allegedly taken to \"shower\" while men and women are separated, imprisoned and coerced to work for their enemies. Likewise, the film also operates at a formal level to further accentuate the oppression of the concentration camp. The form does this majorly with the aid of color transition. Scenes with dull and dark colors are seen in the camp, which is contrasting the bright and lively colors seen earlier in the film before the Jews' imprisonment, depicting the changing political climate in Italy. The use of color effectively highlights the film's message, showing life's beauty at the first half of the film and darkening as manipulation of power and discrimination increases in the second half. Indeed, this illustrates the negative impact of such actions and the poor quality of life when Georg Hegel's Master-slave dialectic comes into play, in which the Nazis become the masters of Jewish people. Also, the uniform pajamas worn by the Jews in the latter part of the film is contrasted with the military uniform of the Nazi soldiers, which accentuates an architecture of difference between the Nazis and the Jews, or perhaps more accurately, the masters and the slaves.\nThe Master-slave dialectic is reversed when Guido chooses to generate another reality for his son in which they are no slaves. Guido's game shatters the false unconsciousness Jews live in, in which it is one of the many rights of the hegemonic minority, the Nazis, to claim power over the subordinate class, the Jews. Having done so, Guido breaks free from the confinement they are in, even though not quite physically, at least mentally. Not only is false consciousness an obstacle in the film, it is likewise so in real life. Indeed, had the subordinate classes, always a majority, not been living in this false consciousness that obscures their sense of reality, they most probably would not allow of such manipulation of power to take place. False consciousness and ideologies are powerful tools that the authorities realize the value of and use to stay in control. However, Life is Beautiful subtly yet effectively challenges such ideologies as a means of transgressing boundaries to wake people up from their deep apathy.\nBeing of a comedian nature, Benigni uses comedy to subtly ridicule the Italian fascism and challenge Nazism ideology. In one of Guido's attempts to win Dora's heart over, he visits the school where she works when he knows they are expecting a visitor, an inspector from Rome. However, unlike the inspector, Guido does not believe in the superiority of the Italian race, or any other race for that matter, over the other races. When asked to lecture on that, Guido mocks the racial superiority argument by describing how perfect his ears and bellybutton are. Of course, it is ridiculous to base superiority on something as trivial as a bellybutton or an ear. Indeed, Guido left everyone in the room either laughing or angry at his \"lecture\". And yet, no one laughs or get mad when people assert that superiority is based on just another external and fixed trait, such as one's skin color. The form in this scene supports this arguments by the employment of irony, in which Guido is captured from low-angles while posing as one the \"superior\" people. Being a comedian by nature, Benigni never states his argument explicitly and neither did he attempt to. He just takes advantage of Guido's brilliant sense of humor to satirize Italian fascism and challenge views on false ideology. And just like that, the argument that Aryans are superior is ruptured and hence the film succeeds in profaning such common yet false ideology.\nAll in all, while Life is Beautiful might first be thought of as a film that is merely about a father and his son, it is much more than that. It is a film that gives meaning to life, even in the midst of life's harshest realities. Yes, Benigni knows how to make his viewers laugh, tear, and even smile through tears. But perhaps more importantly, Benigni knows how to brilliantly illustrate the power of films in transcending architectures of containment. In one film, the architecture of death, of confinement, and of false ideology were all transgressed.",

For every laugh there's a tragic undertone to follow which makes you only worry more about the characters.

            "content": "Combinar uma história de amor e comédia com o Holocausto não soa tarefa fácil, mesmo para os melhores cineastas. É necessária uma certa dose de bravura e originalidade para que o projeto não caia em desgraça, ou pior ainda, desonre aqueles que sofreram crueldades inimagináveis. Roberto Benigni, realizador, coargumentista e protagonista de La vita è bella, parece ter nascido para produzir esta obra, uma fábula sobre a determinação do espírito humano nas mais precárias circunstâncias.\n\nTudo começa em Itália, no final dos anos 30', e a história segue Guido (Roberto Benigni), um empregado de mesa num hotel com uma personalidade altamente carismática. Amigo de um médico alemão (Horst Buchholz) que vai regularmente ao hotel onde trabalha, ambos partilham o gosto por adivinhas, mas é Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, sua esposa na vida real), a mulher com quem se encontra quando menos espera, que lhe conquista o coração.\n\nGuido e Dora estão casados e com um pequeno de 5 anos (Giorgio Cantarini), mas depois de um período de felicidade, em 1945, perto do fim da guerra, Guido e o seu filho são levados para um campo de concentração. Guiado por uma imensa determinação, Guido inventa um jogo para desviar a atenção do seu filho perante o cenário brutal, para que não perdesse a pureza característica da juventude.\n\nComo disse o poeta italiano Dante Alighieri: \"Não há maior tristeza do que recordar na miséria os tempos em que fomos felizes\". É segundo esta máxima que Benigni assenta o seu filme em duas partes, uma pura comédia e outra agridoce. A narrativa começa por expor Guido como um autêntico humorista com influências de Chaplin, mas nas entrelinhas das cenas a ameaça do fascismo é palpável. O seu comportamento antiautoritário, aliado à imaginação, fazem com que seja uma personagem magnética. Torcemos para que tudo lhe corra bem antes de a tempestade começar.\n\nEnquanto pedaço de ficção, Benigni retrata o campo de concentração com leveza para servir os propósitos do argumento (há apenas uma imagem assombrosa de esqueletos empilhados). A história de amor continua, mesmo separado da sua mulher, à medida que Guido utiliza as suas perspicazes capacidades humorísticas para defender o seu filho da brutalidade que se vive nos arredores. É essa perseverança nos tempos mais negros a grande mensagem da narrativa de La vita è bella.\n\nVencedor dos Óscares de melhor filme estrangeiro, melhor ator e melhor banda sonora em 1999, entre outras distinções, Benigni deixou a sua marca no cinema. É uma produção italiana que comove sem o apoio do sentimentalismo e testemunha a convicção do ser humano quando a esperança é tão frágil como a inocência de uma criança. Um equilíbrio notável.\n\n9/10",

The first half of the movie is a funny romantic comedy as Roberto Benigni charms Nicoletta Braschi and the audience at the same time. It’s all this time spent establishing the character of Guido that make the second act work. It could be considered tone deaf and inappropriate to some people, but I think it fits with the precedent set in the first half of the film and makes what is actually happening more severe by contrast. I feel the drama and tension despite Benigni’s attempt to play the clown amidst the madness. There are a few missteps in the execution of the film, and it can get a bit repetitive in parts. Also the first half might seem overly long if you know where the story is headed, because you’ll find yourself wanting to urge the movie along.

It’s humorous yet tragic and subtle yet powerful: a truly remarkable work of art. The story, set in Italy, 1939, revolves around Guido, a comical, young, Jewish waiter. After running into a young woman named Dora on several occasions, a romance between them begins to spark. They eventually marry and share a child, Giosuè.

Matters quickly intensify though when Guido and his son are forced into a concentration camp, his wife demanding to go with them shortly after. Describing the films’ plot is a little tricky because the first 40 minutes of the film almost make you forget you’re watching a Holocaust movie. Every now and then there’s a situation or conversation hinting at (and even mocking) anti-semitism and the spreading ideas of a “supreme race” but the focus is significantly on Guido and his life. When we’re invested in him, we become as innocent as Giosué, forgetting what we know is going to happen. And when it does, it happens within the blink of an eye. In all honesty, I didn’t love the film from the start. Guido’s character initially threw me off. I was more annoyed with his humor than charmed. However, once Guido and his son were taken to the concentration camp, his humor was no longer a nuisance, but an inspiring way of protecting his son. His humor exposed the extent of his braveness and the sacrifices he was willing to make. This is when I started to love his character, and the film as a whole. Even when Guido takes his final steps he takes them with his head held up high, convincing his son that they’re in a competitive game. The film is also well acted and directed. The strong performances from both Benigni (Guido) and Nicoletta Braschi (Dora) definitely help set the story’s tone. While the story has occasional playful and even magical elements, its execution is definitely more realist than formalist.

I understand that there are loads of people who were offended by the movie, calling its use of humor in the Holocaust setting insensitive (and I don't blame them for feeling that way), but the film is not about making fun of its serious subject matter. It is about the human spirit and the power of laughter and optimism. But it also doesn't forget to show the horror of Holocaust and how that changed the lives of many Jewish people forever. I admit that there are too many convenient scenes and I did find some of the humor a little too much, but its heart is in the right place and it often had me laughing like an idiot.

            "content": "Life is beautiful (La vita è bella)\n\nLife Is Beautiful is a wonderful, yet heartbreaking story. The combination of love, humor, and unimaginable grief is what makes this film what it is. The story is about love for your closest ones, and sticking together no matter what. As an audience we get a brief hint of how absurdly horrible the Holocaust must have been for the affected families. \n\nThis story is directed by Roberto Benigni, written by Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami, starring Benigni himself as the protagonist named Guido. One might expect a less of a performance from the man whom already wrote and directed this incredible film, but that is as far away from the truth as it gets. Benigni's character was played exceptionally well, so well that Benigni won an Oscar for the \"Best Actor in a Leading Role\". I have seen a ton of touching war-movies, but this one left me the most vulnerable.\n\nThe first half of the film is a love story full of pure happiness and joy. As a result of more than a few coincidences, Guido manages to get together with the beautiful girl he keeps meeting in various places (in various different ways). It is clear that they love each other, Dora (Benigni's love, played by Nicoletta Braschi) goes as far as to break her current engagement for Guido. Guido himself is an incredibly charming man, not afraid of anyone's judgement. The happiness and success Guido's experiencing gets slightly unbalanced when he and his uncle gets mocked for being of Jewish heritage. Though, we quickly forget about this as Guido doesn't seem to mind it, and the story keeps going on as happy as earlier. Through a beautifully made ellipsis, we cut forward a few years, Guido and Dora now has a child. Their child is a wonderful boy, as charming as his father, named Joshua, played by Giorgio Cantarini. Not soon after we first get to meet Joshua, he and Guido gets taken away by the Nazis. Dora quickly finds out about this and decides to follow them on the train to the concentration camp. This once again proves how strong their love is, and it definitely adds to the sadness of the second part of the film. From this moment on it's all about the family's survival, and how Guido manages to save his son countless times by tricking him into believing that it's all a game, and as a winner of the game you win a tank you get to take home. Guido takes risk after risk for the sake of his family. From what earlier could have been any feel good film, everything drastically turned into a nightmare. Guido's earlier loving charm now turned into something very tragicomic. \n\nBenigno really did hit the spot with this film. The execution of the first half of the film was perfect, and more than necessary for the second part to be as moving as it was. The chemistry between the actors/actresses and their performances was admirable, and it made us care even more for them. The scenery in the second half was excellent, it was just as dark and colorless as you would have imagined a concentration camp to be. I have to say that this is movie really touched me, and I would recommend it to anyone of any age!\n\n/Leonard",

Guido makes the mood of the concentration camp playful and lighthearted by acting as if the camp is a game. The music and bright lighting adds to this effect. In the movie, Guido frequently uses Dramatic Irony, as he says that the camp is a game to protect his son. At the end of the movie, Joshua is surprised that there is a tank that Guido was explaining, and there is an American soldier, liberating the camp, finally reaching his mom, and saying that they won!

            "content": "While the term \"superheroes\" often brings about images of the expanding Marvel and DC Universe, Robert Benigni in Life is Beautiful presents an interesting twist to the common definition by introducing an everyman that holds superhero characteristics in the eyes of his son while in a 1940's concentration camp in Italy. Through Guido's, the protagonist, creative interpretation of the Nazi reign, the film is given a colorfully complex view that mixes lighthearted comedy with dark satire in order to convey the idea that despite life's extraordinary coincidences, humans can control the outcomes; as a result, individuals can experience the vast possibilities life has to offer and realize regardless of the situation, life is beautiful. \n \tIn the opening scene, the audience is presented with moody scenery that consists of dense fog and a shadowy figure walking almost hesitantly through it. This sharply contrasts the next scene in which Guido is trapped in a car without brakes and is frantically telling pedestrians to move out of the way. The difference in between these scenes foreshadows the split between the lighthearted first half and the heartbreaking horror of the second. As Guido continues to gesture the crowd of the way, his motions form a Hitler salute, which people interpret as a sign of pro-fascism and respond with eagerness; this shows the overwhelming presence of fascism in Italy in the later 1930's. However, his awkward flailing of arms and exasperation are cause for laughter and his poking at the prevalence of Hitler's reign is subtle. Guido, however, is not politically vocal, which is most likely a result of him being Jewish. How he leans is demonstrated through little encounters such as when he asks his friend about his political views as his friend reprimands his kids, Benito and Adolfo, and Guido makes an \"eek\" face. Similar to how he is politically silent in the first half, he retains the same sentiments in the second half, choosing to rely on laughter and the joy of being alive by making the concentration camp a game for his son, in which the winner gets a tank. Though some may argue Guido is manipulative and skillfully cunning due to his mass amounts of storytelling and tales, it's what makes him such an odd character and ultimately what drives him into the arms of Dora, his love interest, when he convinces her he's a prince that's going to bring camels to all the land. This serves as a running joke in the film where he constantly refers to her as \"principessa.\" His remarkable luck and unwavering optimism is prominently demonstrated in the first half through romance and insinuates how he'd deal with tragedy in the second half. \n\tDespite Guido's appearance of always saving Dora or being the most remarkable in the room, the everyman pops out when he feels uncomfortable in the fancy hotel in which he serves or he pretends to be a delegate from the Ministry set to teach the younger generation about the superiority of their race. Regardless, he shines through as a hero to those around him. Specifically, in the scene in which he leads children in a laughable lesson on Italian superiority, he demonstrates how he attacks severe political issues and provides a reprieve for the seriousness of others' lives: humor. While he acknowledges exposing the incredible construction of the bellybutton or face will probably not affect these children in the long run, he's happy to have provided an experience not drowning in the lies and absurdity of fascism. His cunningness is later interpreted as his desire to make others around him view the world as magical. His lucky coincidences such as finding a dry hat just as Dora claims she wants a dry hat or finding a luxurious red carpet for Dora to walk on for their date so she doesn't get her feet wet, all provide a fairytale-like aura. His optimism prevails even as the first indications to Nazis taking over Italy, such as the painted horse that insulted Jewish people, and he swirls them all into positive experiences, which gives Dora, a Catholically raised woman, the idea that Guido is something more than human. As a result, she finds herself breaking from her wealthy upbringing to be an everywoman along with Guido since he provides her a sense of security and hope, similar to how many feel towards superheroes in the comics. However, just as Dora and Guido find their magical happiness, it's stripped away. A place that was once filled with light and humor is now devoid of beauty and instead filled with darkness. This is indicated through Benigni's use of color. Color often highlights the thoughts or feelings of the main characters as they venture through their experiences. In the first half, when we encounter a romantic love story, loud colors, such as pink, green, white and yellow, light the screen. Then in the second half, black and grey turns the scene monotonous, introducing the horror and despair felt by Guido.\n\tIn the beginning of the second half, we are introduced to Giosue, Dora and Guido's son, who vibrantly admires his father and shows it constantly through his mimicking of him. Soon, the perfect family is torn apart when fascists take Guido and Giosue to a concentration camp, where for the first time, a positive outcome does not seem plausible. Despite this, Guido's optimism remains stronger than ever, to the point where the viewer questions whether or not he fully understands the gravity of the situation. Camera angles play a prominent character as the audience eases into the tragedy of the camp. A high angle is used to either draw importance to a character's surroundings or provide a visual for how powerless a character may seem. This type of angle is used whenever Giosue is alone in the camp or looking to his father for guidance. For Giosue's sake, he creates a game within the concentration camp, where if rules are followed, the winner receives endless prizes, which include a tank. While Dora, too, is politically silent throughout the movie, she rebels by following Guido and Giosue to the concentration camp, even though she is not Jewish. This serves as a brave attempt to defy Fascist wishes to separate families and create unnecessary misery by controlling the lives of others. This action reiterates Guido's belief that humans have the power to control the outcome, regardless of how bleak it may initially seem.\n\tAs the film nears its end, it becomes apparent the creation of the game serves as not only a way to remain in high spirits, but as a way to protect his son from the harms of the real world. His determination to have his son \"win\" the game and believe Guido is having fun, while he's actually been struggling with cruel labor, is steadfast, impressive, and beautiful. The comedy, although increasingly dark, does not stop as the surroundings grow to be more tragic. Giosue running away from taking a shower, which was actually a gas chamber, provides dramatic irony that borders humor. Guido's persistence to play him and Dora's song over the loudspeaker and calling her princepessa across the entire camp pulls heavily at the heart strings but also allows for lighthearted comedy as we see him fumbling to make his plan work. Later, Guido is told the war is over and the Nazi's are \"getting rid of everything,\" which leads him to figure out a way to protect both his son and his wife. As he tells Giosue they're rounding the final part of the game and he now must hide, Guido is caught by a Nazi soldier, brought to an allyway, and presumably shot. Camera angles once again play a role as the audience is given a low camera angle, indicating the Nazi soldier's power and authority over Guido, who is lower. Giosue, of course, has no idea since as the soldier was guiding Guido to the alleyway, Guido pretended to be a woman and dancing goofily, allowing Giosue to giggle. Moments later, American tanks infiltrate the camp, leading Giosue to jump with excitement and sprint to the tanks believing he won. A close-up is used to focus on detail and his reaction to his surroundings. Once again, a coincidence Guido could not have planned, falls perfectly in line with an outcome that could have easily been just as bad as it had been good. With an American hat on his head, sitting atop a tank, Giosue encounters his mother on the side of the road, exclaiming, \"We won! We won!\" Although it was a victory for Giosue and Dora, Guido's death and Giosue's ignorance represents one's inability to ensure happy endings in this kind of world but also overwhelming ability to be optimistic in the most horrible of situations. \nThough Life is Beautiful originally garnered controversy over the idea of converting a movie about the Holocaust into a comedy, it has since then won four Academy Awards as well as recognition amongst various Jewish film societies and organizations. While critical acclaim does not always translate to what makes a good movie, Roberto Benigni's attempt to show the cruelty of life and the insight and hope within that cruelty goes unparalleled and without fail. By comically attacking fascism and providing us with tearful laughs in the first half of the movie, Benigni successfully manages to inspire and bring about waves of the strength within human spirit in the second half. He presents the sacrificial relationship between a father and a son, leaving us with the impression that parents are the ultimate superheroes, even if they're only saving our own personal worlds. But, above all else, he almost implores the audience to look past the reality of life in its bleakest moments and admire the beauty with which life is pungently filled.",

            "content": "\"This is my story. This is the sacrifice my father made. This was his gift to me.\"\n\nThe film that introduced the world to the charming Italian actor, Roberto Benigni (perhaps not because they saw his actual movie, but for the way he accepted his Oscar for his performance in this film as he leaped through the seats of the actors that were attending the ceremony). This is my favorite foreign film because it manages to balance a wonderful story that begins as a romantic comedy and ends up being about the tragic events that took place during the holocaust. How could Benigni possibly pull something like this off? He's telling a hopeful light hearted story in the midst of a horrific historical event. Using the premise of the love a father has for his child, he manages to turn the terrible ordeal into a childish game in order to protect the innocence of his son. We've never seen a holocaust film quite like this, but it works because of the amazing performance from Benigni and the passion he put into this film. The chemistry between him and his wife, Nicoletta Braschi, and the performance from Giorgio Cantarini playing the cute son end up completely elevating the film and turning a well known horrific story into one of love and hope. \n\nThere are several scenes that stood out for me in this film. At the beginning one can find several similarities with Chaplin's work in The Great Dictator, especially in the scene where Benigni impersonates a fascist professor explaining to the students why they are the superior race. It is a hilarious scene where Benigni proves his comedic physical talent. The love story is so well developed that it could've worked on its own as a simple romantic comedy, but the film takes a surprising turn during the second half where the main focus becomes the relationship between a father and the sacrifice he makes to protect the innocence of his son. It is a beautiful love letter about hope and in my opinion it handles the material with a lot of sensibility. Another brilliant scene where we see how far the father is willing to go to shield his son is when he offers to translate for a German officer the rules of the concentration camp and he completely makes everything up so his son would believe it is only a competition. It is a hilarious movie that at the same time is extremely touching due to the dark events surrounding the film. Benigni took a huge risk with this story, but he managed to find the perfect balance and turned the film into a masterpiece. The music from Nicola Piovani is one of the best scores I've heard in a film and it definitely sets the tone of the movie. \n \nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

But I watched the whole thing on Netflix because I really wanted to know what's going to happen. So for the original dub, Life Is Beautiful is an amazing movie that was a risky thing to do that involves the Holocaust. Putting humor in it could've easily be taken the wrong way and just come up as a bit disgraceful, especially if it takes place during the Holocaust. But it uses it in the right moments which are very weird, but funny at the same time. Roberto Benigini is really good in it and always tried to keep it in spirit and hope which is something that other Holocaust films didn't use, hope. I do like that Guido would say anything to not get his son's mind screwed up which is the right thing to do. The characters are memorable, and the plot is really good.

Despite those great films, if someone asks me which my favorite film from 1998 is, I will easily respond: \"La vita è bella\".\nGuido Orefice is a young Jewish man who lives in Italy in 1939. He falls in love with a young woman named Dora and eventually, after some hard work to get her attention, they get married and have a kid named Joshua. Some few years later, fascism has taken over of Italy and the whole family is sent to a concentration camp. Once inside the camp, Guido uses his imagination and over the top personality to hide the situation from his young son and to keep them both alive and reunite them with her beloved wife Dora.\nFew non English spoken films had managed to be memorable and \"La vita è bella\" is one of them. The first thing that needs to praised is Benigni´s courage for telling a comedy in the depressing setup of the Holocaust, that's a gigantic risk that hadn't been done again since 1940 in Chaplin´s \"The Great Dictator\", but it paid off perfectly thanks to Benigni´s writing, acting and directing. The story presented here is so beautiful and heartbreaking that it remains as the only film that has managed to make me cry, the acting is excellent with the standout being, obviously, Benigni in his portray as a man willing to do everything he can in order to keep his son unaware of the brutal reality they now live in, is heartbreaking but when he is distracting his son is hilarious, it reminds me of the slapstick comedy from the Charles Chaplin films; the comedic timing is done with absolute perfection which makes this film work instead of being an insulting/annoying fantastic tale set up in one of the greatest tragedies in history, the score captures the essence of the story and enhances the experience, and the pacing of this film is excellent, it is goes from being depressing to hopeful and hilarious.\n\"La vita è bella\" is a phenomenal film that will make you feel different emotions, from sad to cheerful. One of the most memorable non English spoken films I´ve ever seen and one of the three films that made me a lover of the seventh art in my preteen years.",

It concerns it'self with a man's pursuit of the woman he loves, and eventually sheltering of his family from the holocaust. The writing is superb, and is by far the main strength of the film. The first half plays out like funny story to tell around the campfire- whimsical and fun- my problems lie in the second half. The second half at the concentration camp should be decidedly more grim, and it is- just not quite enough. Both the score and the pacing failed to adapt to suit the dramatic portion. During possibly the darkest scene the score still plays the main theme, an upbeat contrasting tone. It really distracts from the weight of the scenes. Additionally the second half could have been improved incredible by just slowing down. Slow pacing and less cuts in dramatic scenes could have made everything feel more dire and concrete. The ending felt too fast and unresolved dramatically. Despite this the film still is one that is completely memorable, and well worth seeing. Life Is Beautiful's strengths greatly outweigh it's weaknesses, and overall is one of the best foreign films I've seen in a long time. 4.5/5",

The film gave us a reason to care about the characters because it shows us their daily lives before the holocaust not to say I wouldn't care about them if we didn't know about their stories because anybody subjected to that treatment is unspeakable but its nice to show that effort was made and this film is nothing but effort. Roberto Benigni is the definition of funny, I don't know how anyone can say that they don't like him, seeing him in any film just makes me want to smile, he's just so lovable and he gave a captivating performance that he won an Oscar for, he truly deserved it. It would have been doubly awesome if he won Best Director or even Best Picture! But alas it wasn't meant to be. Saving Private Ryan and Shakespeare in Love won those accolades, the first making sense and the second being highly debatable but nonetheless... Benigni's actions are funny when they're meant to be and just heartwarming when he's meant to be romantic. I really liked the relationship in this movie which was with his real wife, which might have helped. The scenes in the camp where he is trying to connect with his wife again with the aid of music are some of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a film. The movie has a beautiful innocence to it, which might sound insulting but the film is in fact told from a child's point of view so it makes sense and why does every film have to live to a convention? Its impressive that a film like this could be made, let alone be as good as it is, a comedy about the holocaust? It just sounds like suicide but it works. The only scene that I could find that could be potentially offensive is when Benigni is translating a speech to his Italian prisoners. He is translating something very shocking and deadly and making it into a speech about points, but again, its all done for his child, although I will admit I  was biting my nails throughout that whole scene. The only thing I can really take fault with is the fact we don't really see any of the effects it has on Guido, sure he makes everything all fun and games for his child but when he's alone, sure he complains but sometimes it just seems like he's unaware of what is going on but the his pure of heart made the movie, his last scene was exceptionally heart breaking but well done. And maybe some of the movie was unbelievable, like when he speaks into the microphone, it was a beautiful scene but maybe stretching the truth a little, but he never makes the concentration camps seem like a fun time or anything. Amazing movie, highly recommended.",

In fact, I'd say the fact that Guido's attempts to make his and his son's situation lighter only makes us realize just how horrific the Holocaust is. We already know the horrors of the Holocaust and Guido's attempts only create a hopless feeling within us. Benigni's writing and approach to this movie is incredibly affective.",

In the first part of the film Guido is trying to open a bookstore in Italy and at the same time he's trying to win the heart of a local schoolteacher named Dora, this all takes place during the expansion of fascism in Italy. The latter half of the film is about Guido using his young sons vivid imagination to shield him from the horrors of the holocaust, something he accomplishes by telling him some of the most absurd lies you could possibly imagine.\r\n\r\nRoberto Benigni is the co-writer, director and lead actor of this film and the part of the charismatic Guido, with one of the biggest personalities I can remember seeing on a film, is so perfect for Benigni that I don't think any other actor could have played the role well. This is a very subtle offbeat comedy, but it still has its share of hysterically fun moments. It did get some criticism for trivializing the holocaust by not directly showing any of the atrocities committed by the Nazi's, but I think that those critics has quite obviously missed Benignis point and reason for not showing such events. Since most people watching this will already have a pretty clear picture of what went on in the concentration camps Benigni is able to give the audience two perspectives, the adult perspective that knows exactly what's going on and the child's perspective, which is Guido's sons point of view. This is by far the most unconventional, poetic and inspiring holocaust film and definitely two hours well-spent.",

From his I'm going to talk so fast you won't even be able to read the subtitles, to him being a liar about everything in the film.\n\nAnd the second have kicked in when he and his family are taken to a Concentration Camp, and while I get why he would lie to his kid to keep him from freaking out, things he does should have gotten him shot a hundred times over. These must have been the compassionate Nazi's???\n\nThe little kid is a pretty bad actor too, showing almost no emotion in his lines.\n\nThe story isn't bad at all, but why didn't they take anything seriously? After watching this film, you'd swear the Holocaust was a great thing the way they turn everything into a joke.\n\nHad they shown Benigni throwing down some crack, or have him labeled insane in a scene, MAYBE I could have let it pass, but since I don't know anyone that acts like that in real life, sorry I just couldn't buy it.",

It was one of the only foreign films to be nominated for numerous awards. Benigni falls in love with his co-star Nicoletta Braschi who is his actual wife in real life. This movie tells the story of an awful time in our history through the heart wrenching story of the Benigni family. \n\nReview:\n\nRoberto Benigni brings an award-winning film to the entire world. Throughout the film we see many relatable characters that allow us to put ourselves into the movie. We are even introduced to a character that Benigni plays himself. \n\nWhen the movie first starts out is seems like a typical love story. A man (Roberto Benigni) falls head over heels in love with a woman (Nicoletta Braschi). He does everything he can to win her over and it eventually works. They eventually have a son (Giorgio Cantarini). As time goes by the movie takes an adventurous turn that will keep viewers on their toes wanting to find out what happens next. \n\nThe film was overall, very compelling. With all of the great actors, interesting cinematography, and the general plot of the movie viewers could not wait to find out what would happen next. This \"on your toes\" type of film keeps the viewer compelled much like the novel Maus by Art Spiegelman does. They are both stories of intense ups and downs which keep the viewer/reader interested. One of the best techniques of the movie was when Doctor Lessing (Horst Buchholz), reappears later in the movie in an unexpected spot. Roberto's bubbly personality showed through adding humor and a sense of light to the dark topics in this film. The endearing character of Giorgio Cantarini brings in the element of an innocent child to the depressing topic of the movie. \n\nThe one actor that prevented this movie from an excellent review was Nicoletta Braschi. Her performance as Dora, the wife of Benigni, was far from excellent. She was a character with little emotion and often left the movie a bit boring at times. She also looked like quite a boring character in comparison to her husband Guido (Roberto Benigni). She lacked the natural, bubbly personality that Benigni had. \n\nMuch like many of the other films that Benigni has starred in, Life is Beautiful is in Italian. Viewers who do not speak the language must read the subtitles which can get boring at times. While reading the subtitle did get boring, there was great cinematography which kept viewers interested in the story. There were many techniques such as close ups, lighting, and costumes that helped the viewer \"read between the lines\" of the film. Other great elements included the many long shots showing that the characters were distancing themselves from events taking place throughout the movie. \n\nDespite a few not so great parts of the movie Life is Beautiful is both a heartwarming film as well as a heart wrenching one due to the many ups and downs that occur throughout the film. Viewers will enjoy all the great acting and elements of cinematography.",

The way the characters are portrayed are so different compared to other stories told about the Holocaust such as Maus by Art Speigelman. Maus tells of characters living in fear while \"Life is Beautiful\" takes an alternate route and Roberto Benigni uses \"Guido\" to change the aspect of the story and complete what to me is a masterpiece of a movie.",

As things are going well for the new family then story takes a turn for the worst but \nRoberto Benigni, the main character, does an amazing job of turning fear and struggle into a game of love, lies and sacrifice to save the two people that mean the world to him. \n\nRoberto Benigni couldn't have done a better job of playing this part. His use of humor made the darkness of the time more bearable.  Benigni absolutely made the movie for what it is today and no one could have done a better job. His character made it one of a kind movie and it was amazing.\n\nEven though the holocaust was a terrible time all the people had one thing in common and that was never to give up, because once you are at the bottom there is only one direction to go and that is up. \n\nBetween the movie \"Life is Beautiful\" and the book Maus,  the biggest connection between the two is the struggle of survival, of how they both wanted to give up but family is what kept them alive and it's because the love of family that everyone had hope and they made the best of the situation. \n\nEspecially in the movie, although it was a sad time I don't think Guido ever didn't have a smile on his face. In the book, Vladek was not shown as a cheerful character. Vladek was very similar to Guido as they were both very manipulative in order to survive. Vladek would make business deals with anyone to trade for food and shelter. Guido was manipulative in the ways that he would use humor to create a different world for his son to live in instead of a world filled with fear. Overall Vladek was more serious and pessimistic unlike Guido who was always looking on the bright side of things being more optimistic. In conclusion, despite the bad times, it was the love for family that kept hope alive in both \"Life is Beautiful and Maus.",

The star of the movie Guido (Roberto Benigni), who is very comedic and brings light and comedic relief throughout the movie, falls in love with a woman named Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) who already had a fiancé. Dora doesn't immediately fall in love with Guido, however, she soon finds herself falling for they, abandons her fiancé and the two of them marry having a child together named Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini). While they're lives seem perfect the family taken to a concentration camp five years later and Guido tries to stay positive and comedic throughout the movie to show his son Joshua that life is beautiful.\nLife is Beautiful is a unique view of a typically tragic event. The main character Guido brings comedic through the entire movie and although the setting of the concentration camp should be depressing the movie is very uplifting. The sense of love in Guido and his family, especially with Guido and his son Joshua, is very strong. However, the movie still manages to show the hardships of the Holocaust and isn't diluted by the comedy in the movie. The movie shares the similar family values as the graphic novel Maus by Art Spiegelman. Both Life is Beautiful and Maus show strong ties to family during the tragic events. Just like Guido is protective and loving towards his son the main character in Maus, Vladek, also puts his family above everything. While both take place during the Holocaust a key component in both Life is beautiful and Maus is the ties to family. Though Life is Beautiful is a very up lifting movie it is not without its sad moments and the sadest and most shocking moment occurs when Guido sacrifices his life to save his son. Overall movie is very touching and emotional evening out the sad moments with a good deal of comedic relief. Guido shows his son that life is beautiful.",

Writer/director Roberto Benigni stars as a character who tries to charm a beautiful teacher by always bumping in to her and making her feel special. But then Benigni, his wife and child are sent to a concentration camp. To protect his son's life he teaches him to hide from the guards during the day while Benigni goes out and builds a \"Tank\". To protect his from not getting scared, Benigni constructs an elaborate fantasy game that they are playing with all the other Jews in the camp to win the ultimate prize, a real tank. When times get hard and everyone is struggling Benigni never breaks character for the safety of his child. I recently read the book Maus and this movie made me think about the book. Maus and Life is Beautiful are similar because they both take part in the Holocaust and do what they can to get out safely getting back with their family. Both Maus and Life is Beautiful try to do what's best for their child putting their life on the line. If you want to see a movie that is a romantic comedy Life is Beautiful is a must see!",

            "content": "Looking at the bright side of things is exactly what Roberto Benigni does in the Italian film, Life is Beautiful. As the director and lead actor, Benigni will have you crying with laughter throughout the movie with his comical actions and remarks. Produced in 1997, Life is Beautiful had the power to make a high school student enjoy an older film while feeling the wrath of how horrific the Holocaust was. \n\nThis film has a series of important events that leads up to the end. In the beginning of the film, Benigni plays Guido, an Italian waiter who seems to know everyone. Guido is a light minded man who is always in the right place at the right time. All throughout the beginning, Guido runs into a young woman named Dora, who is played by Nicoletta Braschi. Guido has lots of interest in this young woman who he calls Principessa and is always sweeping her off her feet. Eventually they end up falling in love and having a son that will have you saying, \"aw,\" every time he is on the screen. \n\nWhen all seems to be going perfect, Guido and his son are taken away by the Nazi forces to a camp. His wife rushes to get to them and is also taken to the camp. This is where Benigni's comedic talents really shine. While in the camps, Guido and his son are separated from Dora and Guido decides to turn the sore reality of being at the camp into a game to keep his son safe and happy at the same time. He explains how the grand prize of the game is a real tank, which keeps his son wanting to stay in the game. While in the camp, Guido always finds a way to make his son be happy and believe that everything is going to be okay. To find out if Giosue wins grand prize and if Guido ever reunites with his wife again, you are just going to have to watch this magnificent film that may leave you with tears of joy and sadness. \n\nThis movie truly is an inspiring story about someone who is put in a bad situation and does everything he can to make it seem like a normal situation, all for his cute little son. In a lot of ways the movie life is Beautiful is like the Holocaust comic, Maus, written by Art Spiegelman. The comic Maus, is a story about a father who had to go beyond measures to keep him and his wife safe during the Holocaust and how it affected him many years after. Both show the drastic levels that people had to go through in order to stay alive during the Holocaust. They also both use great viewing techniques such as the angle of the shot, up close shots to show certain emotions, and shading/darkness to enhance the importance within the stories.  Both were well written stories, but the big difference between the two that makes Life is Beautiful more appealing is the comic relief that it provides to someone who is watching it. \n\nAlthough this film has some heartbreaking and jaw dropping scenes, it is a movie that will inspire you. It will having you crying with laughter, joy, and sadness throughout, which makes it one of my favorite movies from the 1990's. \n\nJason",

This is evident in Jerry Lewis's failed attempt, The Day the Clown Cried. Not only did the film lack humor, Lewis's dilapidated jokes presented themselves as an onslaught of insults, cold and without heart.  It was the bold, courageous, original Benigni that delicately balanced a story of humor within the atrocities of Mussolini's Italy.  Benigni's masterpiece did not turn the holocaust itself into a trivial satire; rather, he revealed to the audience that within a man's darkest hour one may turn to humor as a defense mechanism.  What made this more than just a movie, what made this a piece of cinematic art was that the protagonist was not using his defense mechanism to protect himself.  He held onto his ability to laugh and smile to protect the people he loved.  He did it to remind them that Life is Beautiful.",

Life is Beautiful is a difficult film to categorize, and an even more difficult to fall for in the beginning, as it's almost too eager to please in the first half. Hang in there, though, and it'll floor you in a way you never thought possible, as the story of an eccentric Jewish man using humor to shield his son from the horrors of a concentration camp is told with warmth and a stark sternness. Writer/director/star Roberto Benigni's comedy-cum-drama is not about Nazis, fascism, death camps, or WWII; it's about the persistence of the human spirit, undying optimism and a parent's unshakable love for their child.

            "content": "La vita e bella, better known in English speaking countries as Life is Beautiful, begins as an exquisite sophisticated comedy with elements reminiscent of an Italian Charlie Chaplin, as well as and excellent drama that handles its themes so well that it's inspiring and sweet and sad and funny and so many other things. To put it bluntly, Life is Beautiful is the Citizen Kane of Italian films, not just due to its excellence but due to the efforts of writer, director and actor Roberto Benigni.\n\nLife is Beautiful succeeds in conveying the message that comes from its title, as the first half of the film is a comedy so sweet and uplifting that its practically magical and evolves into somewhat of a realistic fantasy until transitioning into a tough drama. \nAnd from a technical standpoint, it's excellently crafted due to the stunning cinematography, excellent film editing and most perfectly, the impeccable musical score which is so perfect that it sets the emotional feel of the story just right.\nBut what's most incredible is the script, as the way it handles so many complicated plot dynamics so cleverly before it even hits the screen ensures that the actors all have so much to work with before it hits the screen and it is one of the finest comedic screenplays I've even known to have existed, and to have such a fine comedic screenplay handle such sensitive drama is truly a miraculous thing. Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami are true insightful geniuses.\nThe plot of the story is handled perfectly, and so it's just a solidly incredible thing to watch. \nAnd I cried at the end of the story for a combination of things, for the sadness and the happiness was just in such perfect balance that my eyes became host to streaks of tears that have so much meaning to them, with one of them sad and one of them happy. Each eye was a host to two emotions in Life is Beautiful, and so the experience was exhilarating.\n\nThe performance of Roberto Benigni is so absolutely perfect that he is just impossible to dislike and even though the audience knows he'll end up in a concentration camp, they forget it and get immersed in his absolute charm and skill as a hilarious Italian actor that deals with drama well too, and so the fact that a man so sweet and funny would end up in such a fearful place is horrible and heart wrenching, and it drives it above other war dramas due to the emotional attachment locked in with Guido Orefice long before the themes of war drama kick in. We continue with him, loving him every step of the way through his stepping out onto a trains as he tells his son that they reserved tickets to go to play a game, and up and until the events of the story's end. Whats amazing is the way that the audience connects with him so amazingly that viewers understand what it's like to witness a loves one go through the horrors of the holocaust, and so things become all the more intense and amazing. At the beginning, I predicted that having to read a large amount of subtitles would remove the comedic tone of the acting, but Roberto Benigni restored complete faith into that as the story took off, because it became an excellent hybrid of clever dialogue, fine Italian line delivery and hilarious physical actions that give comedic appeal to the entire world. Of course, much of this is present in much of the cast, but not as much as in Roberto Benigni. There is too much for me to say about Roberto Benigni's performance in Life is Beautiful, but not enough words in the world for me to describe it, so i'll simplify it: Roberto Benigni's performance was enlightening, hilarious, wonderful, sweet, charming, silly, perfect, dramatic, skilfully crafted and worthy of an Academy Award and many other awards, and that he gave one of the finest performances in the history of cinema. In my personal opinion he gave the single greatest acting performance in the history of film.\nNicoletta Braschi also gave a sweet and great performance, playing a good part in the drama of the story and having impeccable chemistry with Roberto Benigni, primarily because they are in fact in love in real life, so their chemistry is charming. Her role as a mother was played well and her emotional loneliness was really well portrayed in a simple sense in the second half of the story. Every time she was greeted with \"Good Morning Princess!\" the audience smiles like she does, so she's great as a character in her own and to add to the determination of Guido Orefice.\nGiorgio Cantarini gave one hell of a fine juvenile performance, amazing because the way his characters innocence is preserved through the whole story can be reflected merely through the sweet and charming look in his eyes and the sweet tone of his voice. It's difficult to find you actors to portray such drama so well and still maintain the charm of a young child, but Italy has clearly had no issues because Giorgio Cantarini succeeds playing his role perfectly and has clearly learned a few tricks from Roberto Benigni in the physical acting sense, and so his performance is all to sweet and simply great in Life is Beautiful and is too realistically the son of both Roberto Benigni and Nicoletta Braschi.\n\nI can see where some of the criticisms come from, namely because limited by his small budget, Roberto Benigni hasn't been given enough to create a film that accurately depicts every inch of the suffering in a concentration camp, and it makes the entire idea seem like its not half bad which isn't likely to please people.\nAlso, the comedic approach to themes involved with the holocaust would have stirred up a lot of criticism, especially for the people who suffered in it. Although the small budget limits it and the horrors are clearly apparent, they aren't expressed as truly as in a film like Schindler's List, but it doesn't reach for as many heartstrings either, so it's lighter to watch, which is good for a comedy-drama.\n\nSo Life is Beautiful succeeds at getting across the titular message and is an absolutely magnificent comedy-drama which succeeds in both areas, and is just so unforgettable that watching it twice in 3 days still isn't enough for me. I loved this movie, and I reiterate that it is in fact the Citizen Kane of Italian films.",

            "content": "Life is Beautiful (Italian 1997)\n\n\"When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry, show life that you have a thousand reasons to smile\" - Unknown\n\n\"Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself\" â\" George Bernard Shaw\n\nThey say life is nothing but the short period of time between initial and final breaths and with in this interval comes everything called a \"moment\". In an abstract sense life is nothing but a collage of moments just like photos in a camera. Not all photos come out good and the same is applicable to various moments in one's life.\n\nThe whole idea of leading life is to cherish every moment of it and beautify them as much as possible as it's a mix of all emotions happy and sad. Oh, but this is just prose and anybody can scribble anything when they get a chance. But is this practically applicable? Do I follow everything I write? No - but when it comes to cinema anything is possible more so that the silver-lining between real vs. reel disappears and expounds itself. \n\nThe 1997 Italian movie - Life is Beautiful - is a classic example of reel life illustriously shown and depicted in perfect consonance with real life.\n\nStory:\n\nIt's Italy in 1930 and we are peeking in to the life of a happy go-lucky guy Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni). One fine day he meets the women of his life Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), love is in the air and pretty soon they are married and blessed with a lovable son Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini).\n\nAll hell breaks down when Guido and Giosue are exterminated to a Nazi concentration camp and wife Dora follows them just in the name of love. Rest of the story is about family spending their time in the facility, father-son relationship, aspirations of hope and restraint against authority.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe film is all about love, relationship, hope and beauty of livelihood. Initial part of the film is a poetic dance of love between the lead couple. The scenes involving hero trying to lure the heroine in to a relationship are extremely hilarious and sensible at the same time.\n\nThe movie takes a sorrowful turn when the scene shifts to a correctional facility in later portions of the film. Irrespective of the sad events the film tries to maintain it's entertainment quotient in the form of extremely entertaining scenes between father and son. Father trying to convince his son about the whole camp being a points game and trying to cheer him up in spite of his intrinsic pathos stands as a testimony for leading life.\n\nPerformances:\n\nRoberto is to realistic performance as Picasso is to painting. As an actor he oozes in to the role with extreme enthusiasm, subtle performance and larger than life compassion towards familial aspects. His super clear antics through out the film are thoroughly enjoyable especially in the scenes with his son. In a way he is the best thing to happen to drama and melancholy if ever they get laced with an entertaining facade. \n\nNicoletta as the wife is more than perfect. You can't help but notice their superfine chemistry on screen in lieu of their real life marital relationship. She dramatizes well as a women torn between hope and love with no respite in sight. \n\nThe little boy Giorgio is a surprise package of sorts. The childish nature of infants even when the whole world around is going down is captured in a crystalline format. The way he responds to his father's game ploys with in the camp is sensitively rational and the kid deserves special kudos for the same. Background score by Nicola Piovani needs a special honorable mention and the renditions are simply superb.\n\nTail piece: \n\nFilms like this are a rarity when it comes to learning aspects. There is nothing to be taken seriously but there is definitely sensible about it as you watch and feel for it's characters. Emotional aspects in the film are so high that the same transcends down to every viewer watching it through his own tube.\n\nThough the title says - Life is Beautiful - not every moment in the film is \"happy\". But what makes it beautiful is living your own life and clinging on to your family through thick & thin and not departing from your duties lest there is a sacrifice. It's the purest lesson on fatherhood and livelihood.",
