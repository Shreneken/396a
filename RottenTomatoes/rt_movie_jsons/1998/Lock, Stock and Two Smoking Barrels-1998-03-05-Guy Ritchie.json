    "summary": "Eddy (Nick Moran) convinces three friends to pool funds for a high-stakes poker game against local crime boss Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty). Harry cheats and Eddy loses, giving him a week to pay back 500,000 pounds or hand over his father's pub. Desperate, Eddy and his friends wait for their neighbors to rob some drug dealers, then rob the robbers in turn. After both thefts, the number of interested criminal parties increases, with the four friends in dangerously over their heads.",

            "content": "Brilliant comedy of errors with numerous hilarious robberies!\n\nDirector Guy Ritchie storms out of the gate with his fiercely gritty directorial debut Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). It remains a brutal, clever, and hysterical crime comedy for the ages. It's as funny as Ritchie's Snatch or The Gentleman. Ritchie's sterling direction takes the chaos of several botched robberies all happening sequentially and finds the humor in the bloody aftermath of a bunch of fatal shootouts and holdups. This movie just gets funnier and funnier as it goes along with gripping characters acting all the way through. Producer Matthew Vaughn was right to give Guy Ritchie a chance as a director because his visceral style and vivid imagination crafts a crime caper with a flair and irreverent humor that had me roaring with laughter!\n\nWriter Guy Ritchie finds the humor in a ton of idiotic criminals all looking to rob the same place one after another in a genius comedy of errors scenario. How you can watch Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and not laugh would be beyond me. The dialogue is full of fun British slang as actors with heavy accents and tough guy bad attitudes all take on the same score. It's such a riot. It's like the old classic comedy The Ladykillers mixed The Usual Suspects and Trainspotting. Casting directors Guy Ritchie and Celestia Fox found a bunch of interesting English actors alongside swarthy newcomers for a fearsome ensemble of tough guy actors.\n\nNick Moran's card shark Eddie is just so dumb that he's endearing. Jason Flemyng's foolish smuggler Tom is a scream with his love of the two muskets that are at the center of the story. Dexter Fletcher is fun as the paranoid cook and smuggler Soap, who wants everything done as cleanly and legally as possible. Jason Statham is hilarious as the tough guy con artist Bacon with his love of roughing up guys and making an easy dollar.\n\nSteven Mackintosh's shrewd and careless weed grower Winston is great. Vinnie Jones is masculine and intimidating as the cash collector Big Chris. Lenny McLean is hilarious and terrifying as the massive enforcer Barry the Baptist. P. H. Moriarty is excellent as the sleazy sex shop owner, porn king Hatchet Harry Lonsdale. Frank Harper's crook Dog is so funny as he keeps getting robbed. Sting is cool as the scary bartender JD. Stephen Marcus' scared Nick the Greek is a blast just like Vas Blackwood's oddball drug lord Rory Breaker. Vera Day is great as the card caller Tanya.\n\nEditor Niven Howie's fast cuts and split screens are neat. I like that 105 minutes feels like 30 by the end of this farce. Cinematographer Tim Maurice-Jones has a gritty and grainy filming style that makes everything a bit more punk and edgy. I love all the funny close-ups on guns and guys looking at the robberies from different perspectives. Composers John Murphy and David A. Hughes creates wonderful lively music. The soundtrack is unreal with anyone from Iggy Pop and The Stooges to James Brown on here. Stephanie Collie's costume design gives each guy various disguises and looks for heists and casual wear.\n\nIn short, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is just sublime stupidity for the quirky crook characters with a clever script and blistering direction from Guy Ritchie.",

Like, don't get me wrong, it is a good film from the get-go but I wasn't personally convinced by it to be more than that until the credits rolled - at which point, I found myself to have been thoroughly entertained.\n\nWith Guy Ritchie in his directing debut and a whole host of familiar British faces, it isn't a difficult film to get into. I did feel at some points that there were too many characters and that they weren't distinctive enough; there were momentary bits where I had to think a tad harder at which characters were linked with each other. However, that actually turns into the film's best thing at the end as it does come together brilliantly.\n\nAll in all, this 1998 gangster flick is something I'd consider as very good and worthy of watching.",

            "content": "It's not as though Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels isn't entertaining.  It's actually quite a bit of fun.  Sadly, the plot is confoundingly confusing at times, in part due to the fact that virtually all of the characters look alike, sound alike and behave the same way.  It's the story of four friends, one of whom is a poker prodigy but manages to lose a significant pot to a local crime boss who goes by the name Hatchet Harry.  The balance of the film follows the four as they try to rip off drug dealers for the money to pay off Harry, competing for the cash against several other involved parties.  Visually, it's a dark, grainy and gritty film that often needlessly resorts to silly visual effects, which only serve to spoil the atmosphere.  There are interesting characters.  There are some laughs.  There is a lot of clever dialogue.  It can be enjoyable if you avoid the temptation of trying to figure out what the hell is going on.",

Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels adds in a little bit of humor here and there, it gave me a few chuckles. The main characters are memorable enough. I'd actually say that the most impressive aspect of this comedy/crime film is the cinematography. It's very realistic, cheap looking, dim and grim, there's a certain artistic appeal to it, and it gives the flick a certain stylish look. I must say that the musical soundtrack is also really kick-ass. Overall, don't get me wrong, this was a good, decent movie. But it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

I got this movie recommended to me by a friend of mine who is a Guy Richie fan, but I don't find this director's movies as amusing as he does and \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\", in my opinion, is just a clever dialogue and plot work. The plot is structured brilliantly starting from the establishment of the characters and ending in a very unique unexpected way. The tones always play around, but mostly has a comedic tone. The jokes are clever and funny and British accent just makes all of them sound better. Jason Statham is the only actor I have recognized in this movie and, in my opinion, the actor that works the best, as you can see him as a very cool guy in the beginning, but as he is opened throughout the film, he does not seem that of an immortal anymore. This film is fun and entertaining enough to keep you up for one night, so I would recommend watching this for a mood boost, as this mostly leaves positive feelings, otherwise, the movie is alright and it wouldn't be a tragedy if somebody skips it. 7/10.",

Luckily, I got enough enjoyment out of it that I’ll be willing to watch it again. After this initial time through, I have to admit I was flummoxed. I think in the last few scenes the story finally came together for me, but until that time it was tough to follow. There are so many characters, and so many stories going on at the same time. They try to keep you up to speed with some voice-over on occasion, but that didn’t do much for me. Each time we’d go to a new location and see another group of thugs I was confused. Perhaps the most disorienting was when we were suddenly in the house where they grew pot, because I kept trying to figure out what these guys had to do with anything else I had watched up to that point. It’s almost like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels would have made more sense if played in reverse. That way you’d start with the convergence of all the stories, and end with them isolated. That’s why I think the second time I watch the movie all the pieces will fall into place for me, because now I know how everything will connect. I’m still debating if this is a flaw in the story-telling, or if it’s a smart script and I just didn’t have the mental wherewithal to take it in the first time. I’m a bit undecided on how I feel about the washed out gritty visuals of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. I can see that Guy Ritchie was going for a particular style, but it didn’t add much to the movie for me, and made all the locations look similar. I loved the cast, though, and their banter was good for a few laughs. It’s not a movie that I fell in love with, but when I watch it again it could grow on me much more.",

His style was imitated to death for the rest of the 90s with many failures, but a notable success of said imitation is what can be the equivalent to the British \"Reservoir Dogs\": Guy Ritchie´s debut \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". \nEddy, Tom, Soap (not kidding) and Bacon (seriously) are four small time criminals that get themselves into trouble as they end up indebted to a notoriously violent mobster who gives them a week to pay. As the amount of money is almost impossible to earn in seven days, the foursome decide to make a heist but they aren't aware of the consequences their actions will bring upon them.\nWith such an atrocious name and a counting with unexperienced producers and director, it would be safe to assume that this film would be a failure, but surprisingly Guy Ritchie´s directorial debut is the exact opposite. \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" counts with solid performances, the comedy is downright hilarious, a shockingly functional use of numerous rock songs, a script that's a combination of Tarantino´s style with \"Magnolia\" type of intertwine writing, dialog that's basically a Tarantino wannabe but focus on sarcastic characters, and it's extremely fun to watch. But this fun and memorable debut film has two major issues: The pacing is so fast that for the first 30 minutes you will most likely struggle to process every character or even the dialog itself, but once you get used to it you will enjoy the ride; and overall Ritchie himself. Guy Ritchie has made name for himself due to his energetic and over produced style that at times works (especially when he focuses on comedy) but at others it just comes off as he is trying too hard to appear as smart as Tarantino by mimicking moments of Quentin´s debut, but let's give credit where credit is due: His almost music video style works perfectly in this crime comedy as it is overall what makes this film fun and hilarious. \n\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" is hilarious, entertaining and overall well-crafted film, despite the fact its pacing is extremely fast and Ritchie´s over produced directing style is at time disorienting. Highly recommendable if you want a good laugh or just want to watch a memorable film that has attitude. Undeniably Ritchie's best film to date and possibly the best Tarantino film not made by Quentin himself.",

            "content": "Oh, what an ear Guy Ritchie has.  Though not a fan of the walls that confine a comprehensible plot, Ritchie may as well be the Brit Tarantino when it comes to dialogue.  Gifted in his ability to craft conversations characterized by a daunting mixture of street guy toughness, blackened humor, and ironic prudence, listening to his characters speak is something like hearing a virtuoso violinist perfervidly perform Johan Sebastian Bach's Chaconne from Partita in D Minor, hardly breaking a sweat.  What a joy it is to watch a film where colloquy is everything, where characters are vehicles for bravura dialogue to travel in.\n\tThe film, 1999's \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,\" was the first for the now cultishly beloved Ritchie, who kept his cheeky stride with 2001's similar \"Snatch\" but lost it all after marrying Madonna and throwing his career away in 2003 with \"Swept Away,\" a misguided attempt to combine work and play.  After \"Snatch's\" release, he's come close to matching the initial triumphs of his first two releases (\"Sherlock Holmes\" brought him much needed commercial success, \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" showcasing him as an immensely capable talent-for-hire), but nothing takes the place of \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,\" whose vitality and crotchety humor makes it as  punchy of a crackpot crime comedy as it was back in '99.\n\tIts hard-to-follow plot, a familiar case of too many characters and too many stories, is its weak link, preventing us from feeling that internal cackle that follows suit after undergoing something like \"Jackie Brown,\" which was similarly complicated but nevertheless straightforward and rewarding to keep up with.  There comes a point during \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" in which the hurricane of thick British accents and bafflements of the intersecting stories becomes too much, us having to throw our hands up in surrender to its byzantine ways.  But its delightful performances and saucy dialogue never lose their introductory charisma - getting lost in its setup is very much a possibility, but tiring of its personality is certainly not.\n\tThe film concerns the misadventures of a pocket of East End thugs, who match in their tendencies to blunder but who vary in their callousness.  Most conspicuously featured are Eddy (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemyng), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher), low-lifes who unwisely devise a plan to earn enough money to land Eddy a spot on the poker table of porn producer Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty).  So intrigued by the prospect of winning big that they forget that Eddy could, you know, lose, we get the feeling that the twenty somethings are way in over their heads.\n\tAnd we'd be right - Eddy doesn't end a victor and instead becomes a victim of the payback.  By the end of the week, he is expected to give Harry an obnoxious amount of cash; Harry, aware that the young man foolish enough to go against him likely won't be able to put his money where his mouth is, eyes his father's bar for purchase.  But Eddy and his pals are virilely forlorn, eventually landing on the idea of stealing from a local gangster's (Steven Mackintosh) marijuana business. Connoisseurs of the heist they aren't, though, and the hot water around them gets even hotter the more they try to get Eddy out of his debt.\n\tA bevy of characters are further introduced, but to list them all off, describing their individual roles in driving the labyrinthine plot, would be tiresome and maybe even worthless; most likely, you won't be able to keep up with \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" any better than me.  You will, however, remain enthralled by its exchanges and its characters - I love the way Ritchie is able to make even the most wearisome of a conversational detail pop with knowing panache, and I love the chutzpah of the performers, especially Statham, then a newcomer, Vinnie Jones, a brawny toughie, and Vas Blackwood, who, with delicious camp, plays a crime boss of unusual merit.  So while \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" is not the direct escapism most hunt for to spend a couple of hours with, its exhibition is unmissable; had Ritchie continued on the path set by it, then he might have been a living legend.  But there are worse ways to be remembered.",

It reminded me that particular Tarantino's movie for the style in filmaking and the tragicomic plot development.

A few of the action sequences are top-notch, and very exciting. But the characters are cookie cutter, and the plot is generic. The fact that people compare this to Tarantino is not right. He would do more with this material than what is done here. Not saying it's a bad movie, but I'm just not crazy about it. By the way, the movie can be really hard to understand at times due to the use of Cockney, or to make it quite simple, the British version of Jive.

Moriarty) after a card game goes sour.\n\nThis movie is hilarious (I mean the script is amazing) the Cockney slang (there is a scene in subtitles for the less Cockney fluent) and the typical British banter throughout the movie makes these characters relatable (yes I can quote majority of the movie). I feel as though I need to mention one of my favourite characters of the movie Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood) \"The mad man with an afro\" and his scenes with Nick the Greek (Stephen Marcus) are hysterical.\n\nBack to the foursome who are desperate to find a solution for their seemingly impossible situation the lads are forced to deal with some unsavoury types (more gangsters and crooks) as they come with an idea that could save them from losing their fingers. This then acts as a platform for movie to merge each subplot together to form a delicious cocktail of guns, gore, gangsters and a lot of weed.\n\nFor anybody watching this that isn't familiar with England, yes it really is that gloomy and wet (not an editing mistake).This movie does have an epic soundtrack (at the start when Ocean Colour Scene comes in really sets the tone of the movie) the tracks are carefully placed throughout the movie (just wait for the Zorba the Greek scene, it's a brutal ballet).\n\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is one of my favourite movies of all time and has everything you'd want from a British gangster movie. With running time of 107 minutes this movie somehow manages to tie everything up nicely within this time, nothing is rushed or longed out. If you haven't realised by now but this movie is for 18's and over (as you'd expect from any decent gangster movie).\n\nBrit Classic",

But all of these factors were only minor nuisances compared to the true artistry that is the cleverness and intricacy of the plot. Many different stories occur at the same time but around the same sort of events such that they all seem related to the story, but in the end, everything all of a sudden independently splits and then comes together into a very well-thought-out climax. The complexity of the story at the end is not exceedingly complicated such that it is difficult to follow, but it is complicated enough to be worthy of praise for its mastery of construction. \nIt did have sort of a hokey Reservoir Dogs feel to it, and the similarities to Taratino--with the dark humor, gory fights, and strange characters--were palpable. And while it did have its problems with overall coherence of character development, humor, and plot, the cleverness of the story leaves me with an overall feeling of admiration toward this quirky crime drama.",

            "content": "A crooked high-stakes card game leads to a series of very entertaining plot twists in Guy Ritchie's superb debut full length major motion picture. In Lock Stock, we're introduced to a dizzying array of characters, who all have a stake in the story as it unfolds. Gangsters, thieves, enforcers, drug dealers. All colliding and fumbling along. Frequently crossing each others paths with hilarious and often deadly results.\n\nThe fact that this film never once lost me is a testament to Guy Ritchie's excellent script, and thoughtful direction. Each scenario develops and evolves in a believable way, and never once felt contrived. It's also loaded with some great performances, and an especially fun debut for Vinnie Jones as Big Chris. This is also Jason Statham's debut movie! Lock Stock moves along at a great, yet controlled pace, and thumps along to a great soundtrack. Very much recommended.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you're from the UK, you're probably going to be okay with the London lingo. Outside the UK, the dialog might be a problem. There's a lot of rhyming slang used in the script. In one scene, and entire conversation is done this way - thankfully, subtitles are provided for this! I would say don't worry about it too much. You won't fully understand ever single line of dialog right away, but you will still be able to follow the story.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe film has a rough wet rusty look to it. It's nicely shot, but you could watch this on any format that suits you and still enjoy it. This film's strengths come from the script, and performances.\n\nBest element for me:\n\nGuy Ritchie's story and script are superb. Check out the IMDB quote page for the movie. There's some great dialog there!\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "I like the work of Guy Ritchie as a director, and because I missed previously his Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, I decided to watch this British crime comedy thriller (written by him as well) and enjoy his recognizable style. The story of a heist film involving a self-confident young card sharp who loses £500,000 to a powerful crime lord in a rigged game of three card brag wasn't too exciting at the start and when he and his friends decided to rob a small-time gang who happen to be operating  of the flat next door in order to pay off his debts, the things started picking up. Witnessing an avalanche of unexpected events was fun with a team of uniquely likable characters and it was expectable that this film brought Guy Ritchie international acclaim and introduced actors Vinnie Jones, a former Wales international footballer, and Jason Statham, a former street merchant, to worldwide audiences. I still think that RocknRolla was much better and not as cartoonish as this one, but many people will disagree with such an opinion.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Sting?s performance as JD, Eddy?s father, even if he was there thanks only to his wife Trudie Styler who was an executive producer on the film. I should mention excellently played role of Barry \"the Baptist\" - played by Lenny McLean also known as \"The Guv'nor\" after becoming the country's top bare-knuckle fighter. McLean became ill during filming, but believed he was only suffering from a lingering case of the flu. McLean died of brain and lung cancer on 28 July 1998, just before the film was released. Producers quickly changed billboards and posters to feature Lenny McLean as a tribute, even though Barry was only a supporting character.\r\n\r\nI will suggest this as a good viewing for everyone who likes fast-paced romp with violence (any sort), gangsters, big money, drugs... as well as short moments of complexity and smartness.",

Si bien Guy Ritchie se digna de tener excelentes talentos en sus diferentes obras, en esta ocasión desaprovecha a su Boby DeNiro como lo es Statham. Tiene un buen argumento, aunque no excelente. Tiene buena trama, algo lenta, pero rescatable. Y tiene cierto grado de acción, aunque se desea más. Las tomas son buenas, pero hay algo que me sigue dejando un sin sabor incluso en esta segunda vez que la vi, porque me dí cuenta que ya la había visto pero no tenía buenos recuerdos de la misma. Las historias de Ritchie son pasajeras y poco memorables, en su mayoría para pasar el rato, aunque eso sí, es un buen rato. Contienen algo de comedia, drama y acción, pero no van más allá. Sin duda tiene un final cardiaco y que lo dejan al criterio del público, probablemente sin este no sería el éxito que fue y tampoco podríamos considerarlo como un buen final o mal final. Aunque ya es un recurso muy mal gastado por toda la industria hollywoodense cuando un escritor no se compromete con el público. A lo mejor ese es el target de Ritchie: exponer obras sin averiguar si son buenos o malos sus finales.",

Ritchie does a good job of gradually introducing the film's characters as the layers of the story develop through narration and hearsay and the characters, from drug kingpin Rory Breaker to Rob Brydon's traffic warden, score the film major plus points.\n \nLock Stock also boasts a brilliant soundtrack of contemporary British music, Ocean Colour Scene, The Stone Roses and some classic songs, Zorba the Greek, that are well used in the film.",
