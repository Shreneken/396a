            "content": "This movie surprised me because how much I liked it. You may be able to tell that I am more attracted to the films with darker tones and harder hitting messages, but there is so much personality with this story that kept my attention. Kiki is a very lovable character and throughout the film you are really rooting for her to succeed especially when she loses her confidence. She isn't out to fight some big evil villain, but just fighting to find her purpose life. It may sound like a simple story, but there are many parts of this that make it more complex and engaging than what you may expect. You have Jiji, her cat that is voiced by the always wonderful Phil Hartman. He is one of those people you love seeing on screen whether he is good, bad, or in between. Tombo is reflective of Miazaki's child-like wonder of aviation you feel encouraged seeing him pursuing his dream alongside Kiki. Osono is a very sweet and motherly parental figure for Kiki on her life away from home. Ursula serves as a great role model for Kiki and is there to support her in her time of need. All the supporting cast carries a great heart and charm about them, and it makes it into a very pleasant feeling film. The message about the power of self-confidence really carries itself through the entire story without forcing a heavy-handed choice at the end. It really shows how much you can have done when you believe in yourself and have really supportive friends around you.",

The highlight is Kiki (a 13-year-old girl who just happens to be a witch with a broom), and her experience getting a job in a strange new place while on the path to becoming an independent witch. Not only are the characters written well and play significant roles in helping to build Kiki as a person, the world around them is expertly constructed to support the narrative. Another Ghibli masterpiece that serves to remind audiences that Anime isn't just about fan service. 9.5/10",

            "content": "Kiki's Delivery Service is the best Ghibli film, meet me out behind the dumpsters if you want to fight.\n\nPart of what makes Kiki's Delivery Service so great is its sense of restraint. Yes, Kiki is a witch and her ability to fly (a common motif in Ghibli films, particularly those in which Miyazaki had a hand in creating) grants us some incredible sweeping visuals, but witches are shown to be relatively familiar in this world; a curiosity, but not unheard of. So while you get to be whisked away by the charm and whimsy of the premise and animation quality, you have this amazingly down to earth protagonist whose struggles are eminently relatable - growing up, maturing, finding a sense of self and exploring while remaining vulnerable. While there are certainly bumps along the way, her journey introduces her to a number of interesting characters, many of which become close friends. Though there is a sense of safety inherent to a world this good-natured, Miyazaki doesn't forget about the bit of loss involved with groing up; when Kiki regains her powers, it's a triumphant and grand moment, but tinged with sadness as she realizes that she still can't communicate with her cat, Jiji. It's a necessary evolution, but there is still some bit of melancholy in it (but then you see that fantastic end credits sequence with Jiji's adorable kittens, and even a younger girl wearing Kiki's outfit, just to make sure you don't walk away legitimately sad).\n\nA brief note, one thing that Ghibli has always done incredibly well is character design, from physical attributes to mannerisms. And it's not limited to major characters, here some of the most endearing and charming individuals are the supporting roles, who convey so much nonverbally or through their reactions, such as the dog Jeff and particularly the daydreaming and excitable maid. Gosh, the details are good.\n\nRewatched at Ghiblifest 2022. (5/5)",

There was some boomer-esque criticism of the younger generation sprinkled in and I didn't like how insincere she was with her apologies (her dad had prolly been planning that camping trip for weeks) but those were relatively unobtrusive problems in what was otherwise a very enjoyable viewing experience.

No, you can instead turn it into calm, warm, enchanting slice of life coming of age story with lots of small, inconsequential events. You can then tell a story that is all about characters and the bonds between them, not really though about the adventures they have themselves.

In a sense, it is an anti-\"young adult media\" piece that rejected the many downfalls of \"Harry Potter\" copies and anime for teenagers even before they grew in popularity as a genre.

Overall, the premise of creating a Low Fantasy about a witch that struggles to find her way in a world of non-magic folk was a very well-executed idea, even with the film's flaws on lack of spunking the same level of intrigue as other Studio Ghibli or Hayao Miyazaki films. \n\nFinal Rating: Solid to Great 8",

The movie has little in the way of external conflict, but Kiki deals with internal struggles such as self doubt, loneliness, and vulnerability. The movie handles these themes, and others including the transition from childhood to adulthood and ideas of traditionalism Vs modernism, in a mature and well-written way. The movie\u2019s animation has aged a little, but in a charming way that adds to the tone and look of the movie. I highly recommend the movie if you\u2019re looking for a cute, wholesome movie that has some depth and substance to it. ",

            "content": "Hayao Miyazaki's love of flying is taken to new heights with a witch's broom!\n\nHayao Miyazaki's coming of age drama fantasy anime Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) is an adorably breezy film and one of his finest features. Eiko Kadono's story about a teenage witch going out on her own is very quaint and relatable. It's easily one of my absolute favorite Miyazaki features from Studio Ghibli. You just have to see Kiki's Delivery Service!\n\nMiyazaki's writing lets you empathize with Kiki naturally. Miyazaki dives inside the mind, heart, and feminine perspective of a young girl growing up with dreams of being a witch. She's so relatable and sweet. I think Kiki is one of Miyazaki's best characters and a gentle heroine in her own right. Her bravery comes from the simple courage to go out on her own and forge her own career staying true to her witch self. I'm sure all girls and boys will relate to her melancholy and uncertainty as Kiki learns to believe in herself and find her own inspiration. I also adore how Kiki remains kind despite her depression and unconfidence for a touching lesson in morality.\n\nMiyazaki's direction is fantastic as he gives Kiki's Delivery Service this chill pace and cheerful atmosphere. Kiki's Delivery Service displays Miyazaki's love of flying with brilliant blue skies, a flying witch's broom, a dirigible, and even a propeller bicycle. You feel like soaring with Kiki on her broom as she delivers packages for townsfolk. His direction is always bright and focused as you go on an emotional odyssey with Kiki going on dates, training to be a witch, and making friends like any girl wishes for in her youth. Kiki's Delivery Service is perhaps the most adorable and endearing anime film of Miyazaki's with low stakes conflicts for an ever loving anime picture.\n\nKirsten Dunst is the perfect voice actress for Kiki in The English Dub of Kiki's Delivery Service. Her sincere caring vocal performance is radiant. Dunst ensures that Kiki is endearing and relatable. Her soft, cute voice finds a playful whimsy, yet heartfelt blend that just works for Kiki. Kirsten Dunst is my favorite actress of all time, so it was wonderful for me to hear here as Kiki's spirited voice.\n\nJaneane Garofalo is phenomenally down to Earth as the sweet lady friend of Kiki's named Ursula. Her natural exuberance is infinitely charming and pairs nicely with Dunst's quirky Kiki. Debbie Reynolds' voice for Madame sounds so gentle with an earnest kindness to it that fits Madame's nice treatment of Kiki. Tress MacNeille voices the bubbly Osono who takes Kiki in at her bakery as a delivery girl. Lastly, may Phil Hartman rest in peace, who delightfully voices Kiki's snarky cat Jiji. He captures Jiji's restless nature and hesitancy at anything new or uncomfortable that Kiki wants to try spontaneously. \n\nTakeshi Seyama's editing is very relaxed as he allows shots to linger on the cute encounters and beautiful imagery of Studio Ghibli's lovingly hand drawn animation. Seyama's cuts and Miyazaki's direction keep Kiki flying by like a Summer breeze for a cool 103 minutes. Kiki's animation is breathtakingly stunning, vibrantly colorful, and vividly realized with realistic fluidity in their motions. Shigeo Sugimura's striking cinematography is stuffed with pretty far wide shots during Kiki's broom flights and engaging close-ups of Kiki's expressive face. Kiki's enchanting design is adorable and her winning personality is ever endearing. Kiki really is a darling witch from the mind of Miyazaki.\n\nHinoshi Ono's production design makes the town appear quaint and detailed with a charming warmth, while his art direction looks resplendent in all the open skies of blue and large cobblestone streets. Yoshifumi Kondou's visual effects are particularly lovely whenever Kiki takes off. I found Kiki using a street sweeper's broom to take off with a swirling gust of wind especially dear. Joe Hisaishi's score is as charmingly delightful with playful melodies and serene passages throughout Kiki's Delivery Service. His music provides an air of romance, sense of adventure, feeling of discovery, and endless dreamy atmosphere to Kiki's Delivery Service. His steadfast compositions are always a highlight within Hayao Miyazaki's iconic anime films.\n\nIn all, Hayao Miyazaki's anime movie Kiki's Delivery Service is a pure joy to watch. It's peaceful tone is always pleasant. Kiki's Delivery Service is an easy recommendation to all viewers.",

Kiki's Delivery Service is a delightful escape into a mesmerising and beautifully illustrated world, and its manifestation in the eyes of a little girl with big dreams. But what is profound about this feature is its devout emphasis on kindness, with Miyazaki subtly elucidating the too-often-forgotten positive influence that each of us can have on one another \u2014- a fable that is evermore resonant in times such as these.\nIroh's grade: B+",
