    "summary": "In 1942, Private Witt (Jim Caviezel) is a U.S. Army absconder living peacefully with the locals of a small South Pacific island. Discovered by his commanding officer, Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn), Witt is forced to resume his active duty training for the Battle of Guadalcanal. As Witt and his unit land on the island, and the American troops mount an assault on entrenched Japanese positions, the story explores their various fates and attitudes towards life-or-death situations.",

            "content": "A philosophical (anti-)war film that does not spare bloody brutality and at the same time tells the harsh reality of war from the point of view of the soldiers' thoughts in several individual storylines. Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, his first film in 25 years at the time, represents the director's unique form of filmmaking in a poetic and naturalistic way. On the beautiful island of the Solomon Islands, where US soldiers are fighting the Japanese, it is a matter of life and death for the warriors.\n\nWar films often focus on a single protagonist, from whose perspective the events are portrayed up close and who stands as the glorious hero at the end. Malick would not be Malick, however, if he copied this chronology one-to-one. Therefore, the focus in this film is on an entire ensemble in which all the soldiers fight for their survival and try to distract themselves with private thoughts as they make their way through the tall grass towards the Japanese retaining wall. The protagonist is a different one every half hour. At first Sean Penn, then the two brawlers Nick Nolte and John Cusack, then James Caviezel, until towards the end it is Penn again. They are accompanied by their no less representative comrades, including the likes of Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody or John Travolta. Even George Clooney can be seen for three minutes before he disappears from the screen again. One could almost think that Malick has ordered Hollywood's créme de la créme and packed them all into cameo appearances. However, each one has a specific place in the film and is deliberately used in these brief moments. You buy the sheer horror of war from all of them, especially Nolte, who shouts a lot but executes the role of an authoritarian leader to perfection. Malick's unconventional casting is matched to numerous scenes - and it works. Even when it's hard to connect emotionally with a character, every single plot line is engaging. Everyone goes through different emotional states, which makes for a lot of variety in this regard and creates a multidimensional picture of a war soldier's mental situation. This is not only due to the authentic acting of the actors, but also to the respective voice-overs, who tell their numerous trains of thought and sometimes personal stories.\n\nMalick has taken a very unique approach to the war film genre - naturally, after all, he is probably the most nature-loving director ever. This can seem tough and pretentious to many, and indeed The Thin Red Line does have its long-winded moments. But Malick does not forget the actual theme. He does not spare explosions, brutal bloodshed and macabre explicit images. Thus, he illuminates the scenarios and realities of a merciless war no less than other films of this genre. Through the impressions of the beautiful landscape, which seems almost too good to be true, and philosophical digressions, it then fundamentally differentiates itself. Moreover, it is carried by Hans Zimmer's heavenly score, which enviously adapts to the action. A true stroke of genius by a very special filmmaker.",

            "content": "There are many who feel that Terrence Malick is one of the top 5 directors to ever grace the screen with his vision of what cinema should be.  Reading audience reviews, it is clear that many moviegoers are enamored with him.  I am now a mere two films into his catalogue, and I have firmly decided I'm not one of them.  I thought after first seeing 2019's A Hidden Life recently, \"Maybe he's just one of those artists who killed it early on, and then the studios decided to give him way too much rope without anyone to reel him in.\"  After finally getting around to The Thin Red Line, I realized that nope - he's been like that since 1998.  I'll admit, I'm a long time ardent fan of Saving Private Ryan for it's realism, storyline, acting, character development, cinematography, etc, etc, etc, so I tried mightily not to compare the two as I watched, but it became harder and harder the more strikingly un-similar they got.  While Malick nailed the realism, giving you a true sense of what young men must have felt as their daily existence descended from utter fear into complete madness during WWII, and he no doubt is one of the best cinematographers to ever put images to digital film, I couldn't help wonder why someone...anyone...never stepped in to chop about 45 minutes of runtime off this behemoth and remind him that storytelling is essential to the moviegoing experience.  I get what he's trying to do, and in certain ways, his techniques can be effective to helping you understand the psyche of each soldier as they experience hell, but frankly, I found myself experiencing my own hell of boredom.  I wasn't engrossed in the characters at all, and the cutaways and voiceovers during important moments distracted rather than expounded.  After two of his films, I'm convinced that Malick is simply a pretentious arthouse director who is more intent on creating his vision of what a movie should be rather than a creating a movie that people might actually want to see more than once.  Saving Private Ryan left me in stunned silence, truly admiring the men who fought so hard to free Europe.  The Thin Red Line left me wondering why I wasted the last three hours.",

The film, like most of his work over the last twenty years, swings wildly from indisputably brilliant to maddingly pretentious.  On the positive side, the cinematography is stunning, the dialogue rings true, the editing is spot on (especially during the battle scenes, with many long takes that increase the impact), and the score is subtle but effective.  On the negative side, scenes are often interrupted by cloying philosophical musings in the form of voiceovers and distracting flashbacks that disrupt any tension that has been built up. Strange shots are also included of things like a baby bird struggling on the ground or a dying leaf with sunshine filtering through it.  These presumably symbolize the fragility of life or foreshadow death, which may be a bit redundant since we already know we are watching a war film.  If you can overlook the excesses, it is a powerful and well-executed film.  If you can't ignore the excesses, don't bother with the film.",

            "content": "The most brutal war film ever made.\n\nTerrence Malick's war epic The Thin Red Line (1998) utilizes its behemoth cast of stars and Malick's own words with his directorial vision culminating in a harrowing ordeal. The Thin Red Line makes a convincing case for the death of all war as men lose their lives, minds, rationale, kindness, empathy, decency, and humanity during the conflicts brought about by war. \n\nI should warn viewers The Thin Red Line is nearly 3 hours of horrific murder and defeated attitudes. I have to hand it to editors Billy Weber, Leslie Jones, and Saar Klein for editing down Malick's intimidating war masterpiece to a highly coherent 2 hours and 50 minutes. It may turn off some audiences with its slow burn pace and grisly violence, but I found The Thin Red Line riveting in its thoughtful messaging and gripping in its suspense driven warfare wherein an enemy can pop out of the tall grass of the Pacific Islands at any moment.\n\nTerrence Malick's direction is pensive and focused. He relies on heavy narration from the perspective of various leading characters that deliver enthralling voice work conveying their sorrow, misery, and dejection during World War II. Malick's writing is poetic in form and complexity. His dialogue is written in eloquent phrases that essentially mean war is a self defeating institution wherein both sides inevitably die gruesome pointless deaths. The Thin Red Line elevates action into a display of pain and shocking intensity that is sure to bother many viewers. Malick explains all the suffering with beautiful words full of reflective sentiment that deliver upon the film's promise to give a new perspective on war's traumatizing effect on soldiers.\n\nHans Zimmer's score for The Thin Red Line is a blaring loud, constantly pounding, sonic throb. Zimmer composed some of his most minimalist sounds, yet the atmospheric pressure that his score brings to The Thin Red Line is undeniable. You know that an ambush can come at any time during the quiet moments, then Zimmer's music soars into hearing and assaults you with massive blasts of adrenaline that are as deafening and explosive as the air strikes in The Thin Red Line.\n\nJohn Toll's cinematography for The Thin Red Line is timeless. He captures the natural beauty of the rain-forest as well as its quiet threat wherein any foe can appear out of nowhere at any time. Toll films cute animals in the surrounding area to offset the numbing violence sequences that are sure to follow and shock. Malick's film-making technique is also on point for The Thin Red Line as a majority of the film utilizes long tracking shots that sweep a location with a magnificent panning technique. The incessant gunfire, mortar fire, grenade explosions, and soldiers screaming scar the cinematic safety net of the screen. All the violence, combat, and trauma flies out of the screen like shrapnel. Toll's steady camera work is what forces you into the perspective of a soldier crawling around a rain-forest or a grassy hill, paranoid the enemy's forces are about to descend upon you.\n\nThe Thin Red Line's impressive ensemble cast is nothing to scoff at as every character is portrayed by a superstar. In particular, Jim Caviezel is engaging as the conscious stricken soldier of mercy. Sean Penn is remarkable as the jaded and realistic soldier with experience. Caviezel and Penn's chemistry as friendly soldiers with opposing opinions is absolutely fascinating. Elias Koteas is amazing as the highly moral and ethic captain that refuses an unthinkable order. Nick Nolte is fierce and fearsome as the commanding officer that gave such a heinous order. Jared Leto is brave and cautious as the soldier that sends his men out of the grass, getting them riddled by bullets. Lastly for the main cast, Adrien Brody is paranoid and afraid of the danger engulfing his every step.\n\nFurthermore, Miranda Otto is dreamy as the loving wife of one of the soldiers, who writes her husband a \"Dear John\" letter in one of The Thin Red Line's most devastating moments. Ben Chaplin is inspiring as the positive thinking soldier dreaming only of returning home to his wife with a sullen revelation. John Cusack is sad as the soldier that realizes his leader is crazed beyond what he can cope with and his men are doomed. Woody Harrelsen is commanding as the tough sergeant, who meets an embarrassing and upsetting end. John Travolta makes an appearance as a confident brigadier general. John C. Reilly is a neat foil of apathy at the end for Sean Penn's resolute soldier. Dash Mihok is fantastic as the deepening insanity descends upon his soldier. Tim Blake Nelson gets a few funny lines, whereas Thomas Jane gets a content soldier of inevitable apathy towards war makes him quit in a great sequence alongside Sean Penn. Even George Clooney makes a cameo at the end as the newly appointed captain to lead this regiment.\n\nTo conclude, Jim Caviezel, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte, Adrien Brody, and Jared Leto all deliver outstanding acting performances. However, Sean Penn is my favorite character in The Thin Red Line because you know where his character stands from the beginning. Penn finds a contemplative persona for his deeply reflective and bluntly honest character that I found riveting to the last. His face alone reveals a worn acceptance for the trauma and loss that comes with war. I think The Thin Red Line may contain Sean Penn's finest acting.\n\nIn short, I urge you to trudge through the muck and misery for a transcendent experience unlike any other war film. The Thin Red Line will wear you down until you are emotionally spent of all joy.",

The battle sequences are shot with jaw dropping camera work and nail biting choreography that aptly portrays the battlefield of war. \n\nThe cinematography is metaphorical with neat and clean visuals, live locations and bright colors that lights up the screen like never before. Zimmer's sensational background score and sharp sound effects of all the bullets, explosions, soldiers panting, rivers flowing and birds chirping, every bit of it factors in effectively to the bigger picture. \n\nThe script might be divided into various sequences whose structure is transparent for the audience, something that may not be feasible for the makers. The performances are mostly scattered in bits and pieces but the show stealers would definitely be Penn, Nolte, Brody and Caviezel. \n\nMalick's adaptation is mature since he blends it in with his own ingredients that may not be crispy but is tender and husky to respect the genre and premise. His eerie execution always goes through the roof, since each anticipated emotions does carry out of the screen and rains all over the audience. \n\nCut throating politics, morality conflicts and exceptional one liners that digs in deep are the high points of the feature. Malick's world is not bold and waiting to show off, it is sensible and calculative and as a character quotes in the beginning, \"not everyone is smart enough\". \n\nThe Thin Red Line might have a weak line but it undeniably is three dimensional and it is inexplicably glorifying to see it come alive.",

It could be something truly special and might have even competed with Saving Private Ryan for best WWII film of 1998. The problem is Terrence Malick is not content to just make a movie, he has to make a work of art. His idea of what makes a film great is so far removed from my own that I end up shaking my head in frustration. There is an abundance of breathy voice-over that overindulges in metaphors. Every character in voice-over and in heart-to-heart conversations talks like a Greek philosopher. There is symbolism oozing out of nearly every frame, and it is shoved in willy-nilly as opposed to keeping it in the logical structure of the film. It's cut so that you jump from the middle of a bloody battle where men are getting slaughtered and then all the sudden we see a baby bird that has fallen from its nest. The bird is not on the battlefield, it's not something that one of the soldiers encountered, because that would be a sensible way of injecting symbolism into your film. No, we just cut to that shot randomly and then cut back to death and destruction.\n\nThe pacing of The Thin Red Line I think could be best described as herky-jerky. It goes long stretches where nothing of relevance is happening other than soliloquies intermingled with images of trees, past love affairs, and more artsy-fartsy film school nonsense. Then, just when I'm about to fall asleep, we are thrust into battle and we get to see the soldiers act like real people, and start fighting a vicious battle trying to overtake a bunker or something like that. The big problem with the structure of Malick's films is that ethereal voices and a handful of random short flashbacks do not create character. So it's not long before I realized that I didn't care about any of the people who are getting gunned down because I don't KNOW any of them. There are loads of familiar faces in the cast, some really spectacular actors, but that's not enough to make me see any of their characters as real people. The closest I came was with Jim Caviezel because his character was set up early and almost had an arc, but even his death didn't quite resonate for me (perhaps the boredom had overwhelmed me at that point.) It's such a shame because there are snippets of time when The Thin Red Line is stunning and could be remarkably powerful, but Malick can't tell a consistent story because he has to attempt to make every moment deep and profound. If you tolerate Malick's particular brand of film-making then this movie is right up your alley, but for most movie fans I'd say avoid at all costs.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Fast scheint es so, als ob die Darsteller, bemüht um Realismus, einen ganz anderen Film machen wollten als ihr Regisseur, der die Fragen des Lebens stellt während des Geschehens. Diese Schizophrenie macht den Film faszinierend. Er weiss selbst nicht genau, wovon er eigentlich handelt. The Thin Red Line scheint im Werden begriffen zu sein: Ein veträumter Poet meditiert über die harte Realität. Über dem Soundtrack hören wir die Gedanken der Charaktere monologisierend (obwohl es manchmal nicht überzeugend scheint, dass diese Figuren überhaupt derartige Gedanken haben könnten). Sie klingen so, als ob sie alle mit derselben Stimme sprechen würden. Einer die weiser und älter ist als die Soldaten, die wir sehen: Es ist die Stimme des Regisseurs Terrence Malick. Malick hat zwei der besten Filme aller Zeiten gedreht (bis dahin hatte er überhaupt nur zwei inszeniert und der zweite kam 1978 ins Kino). Sein dritter Film wirkt nun 20 Jahre später wie eine Erweiterung, denn wieder grübelt eine Stimme, abgehoben vom Geschehen. Malicks Filme teilen den transzendenten Glauben, alle Dinge der Natur obliegen einer Realität Gottes. \"Why does nature contend with itself?\" Wir sehen ein Krokodil, einen Killer, dann die Wirren des Krieges. Warum streitet Gott mit sich selbst? The Thin Red Line eröffnet mit einer Idylle auf einer pazifischen Insel. Zwei Soldaten haben sich von der Truppe entfernt. Sie sind umgeben von Eingeborenen, die die Früchte der Bäume essen. Wir sehen das Beste im Menschen, doch die Harmonie wird unterbrochen: Beide Soldaten müssen zurück zu ihrer Einheit. Während der Kriegs-Szenen erleben wir Flashbacks zum paradiesischen Zustand auf der Insel. Daneben erleben wir die Erinnerung eines Soldaten an die Umarmungen seiner Frau. Die Ideologie des Krieges dagegen wird verkörpert durch den Colonel (Nick Nolte). Er liest Homer auf griechisch und ist wild auf seinen ersten richtigen Krieg (nachdem er so lange nur Krieg studieren durfte). Der zweite Akt eröffnet mit der Schlacht um einen Hügel. Der Colonel will durch die Mitte stürmen, sein Captain (Elias Koteas) aber verweigert den Befehl, um über die Flanken anzugreifen. Er hat nur insofern Recht, als dass er den Plan des Colonels als Selbstmord bezeichnet - nicht aber angesichts der Blutlust des Colonels. Die Charaktere der kämpfenden Soldaten sind nicht sauber heraus gearbeitet, so dass wir uns manchmal gar nicht sicher sind, wen wir gerade vor uns haben. In Malicks Film ist es auch möglich, dass eine Figur ihr Wesen während der Handlung verändert (der Captain wechselt seinen Charakter offenbar einfach aus). The Thin Red Line ist kein konventioneller Kriegsfilm. Die Schlachtszenen an sich sind meisterhaft, wenn die Kamera mit den Soldaten durch das hohe Gras kriecht. Malick geht es aber nicht darum, einen klassischen Kriegsfilm zu machen. Der Feind, die Japaner, sind vollkommen ohne Persönlichkeit. Ihre Dialoge werden nicht einmal untertitelt. Im Grunde sehen wir sie gar nicht als Feinde, sondern Widersacher der Natur im Kampf mit sich selbst. Aber träumen sie auch von der Natur, der Liebe und Menschlichkeit (denn die Japaner bekommen kein Voice-Over)? Malick hat grosse Schauspieler wie Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson oder John Cusack besetzt, die auch den richtigen Ton treffen für ihre Rollen. Bevor sie aber im Film etabliert werden, lässt Malicks Regie sie schon wieder fallen. John Travolta und George Clooney sind nur so kurz zu sehen, dass man den Eindruck bekommt, sie wären nur als Star-Gäste gebucht worden. Wir müssen akzeptieren, dass er einfach keine Lust hat auf eine herkömmliche Dramaturgie. Weder die einzelnen Figuren, noch das Voice-Over machen aber die Qualität von The Thin Red Line aus. Es ist Malick selbst! Seine Ideen sind aufrichtig und herzlich - aber nie tiefgründig. Seine Fragen sind zwangsläufig, nur bezweifele ich, dass ein Soldat im Krieg sie stellen würde? Ein Film aber, der Gedanken wie die von Malick ermöglicht, ist es Wert, gesehen zu werden! Im Grunde müssen wir, das Publikum, sein Werk vollenden. Malick selbst scheint nicht sicher zu sein, wohin er gehen will. Jedoch: Es ist richtig, eine Frage nicht zu beantworten, wenn es nun einmal nicht möglich scheint! Die meisten \"Anti-Kriegsfilme\" sind \"anti\" aus der Perspektive der Gewinner-Seite. The Thin Red Line ist ein Anti-Kriegsfilm, der aus der Perspektive der Verlierer erzählt wird: Der Natur im Kampf gegen sich selbst. Wir im Kampf gegen uns.",

Essentially a meditation on the effects of war upon humanity, focusing primarily on the individual, the film offers up some impressive set pieces, notably the storming of a hilltop bunker and the siege of a jungle village. Much of the acting is also impressive, the various psychological aspects of combat examined largely without dialogue. The cinematography is also excellent. Unfortunately, at 3 hours the movie more than overstays its welcome. Things could have wrapped up around the 120 minute mark, because after that the film appears to almost give up on narrative drive and instead wallow in... well, pretty much nothing actually. The movie fills itself characters, many of them played by recognisable actors, and proceeds to either kill or largely ignore them, and as such we get to know virtually none of them. Big names like Travolta & Clooney show up for a handful of minutes and contribute precisely nothing, making their involvement seem like a desperate attempt to jam some high profile stars onto the poster and advertising. The preachy and intrusive narrations are irritating, as is the trite, repetitive score and heavy-handed symbolism. Classic war films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon outdo this pretentious mess in nearly every aspect, and certainly leave a much more lasting impression.",

Big questions are asked, even seemingly banal ones, but somehow they manage to reach the audience for real, just as well as the horror of the battlefields that we all know about, but here we are lured into feeeling it for real with terrifying intensity for 3 hours straight. At the same time, there is also the possibility of reconciliation and light, through breahtaking images and music. For me, this quote sums it up very well: \"One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain, that death's got the final word, it's laughing at him. Another man sees that same bird, feels the glory, feels something smiling through it.\" I don't usually like war movies and pathos, but this movie has definately moved me, and the slow pace and length of the film made it all the more powerful.",

Saving Private Ryan, which was released the same year as TRL, its a great movie itself but the two cannot be compared. Saving Private Ryan was more of a technical achievement showing the gruesomeness and violence of war, with the Thin Red Line showing the emotional impact of war on the human spirit. The Thin Red Line is beautifully shot, with incredible vivid scenes of this Japanese Island. The action is masterfully done, drawing suspense and keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat. The dialogue is poetic and really captivates human emotion through such turbulent times.\n\nThere is one scene toward the middle of the film, in which Americans raid the Japanese  patrol camp, really shows well what the Japanese go through, losing their pride and understanding that they have failed their country. The scene comes to a climax as a Japanese POW tries to antagonize the Americans just so they can kill  him, putting him out of his shame and dishonor. During this scene Hans Zimmer's amazing incredible score reaches a crescendo, truly captivating me during this scene. One thing that worried me going into this film, was the use of such a large ensemble cast, as too many stars in one film may seem overdone. This is not the case though, as each actor pulls off incredible performances and all their talent comes together as one. There is great chemistry with each of the actors, and the characters exemplify this on screen with their relationships with each other. Terrance Malick shows great direction and vision, as I have never seen such a beautiful film which deals with such dark and real topics. \n\nThough the film is a bit lengthy, not for moment does the story drag, its poetic realism and visual beauty and just incredible acting make this film that you must see if you have not already.",

The Thin Red Line is a beautiful looking movie that is so muddled in the artsy whims of Terrence Malick that it seems to have no real narrative or much semblance of a plot. The cast is huge and talented, but no amount of talent can fix a broken narrative. In fact the original script centered the movie around Adrien Brody's character, only to have Malick decide to change the main character to Jim Caviezel's character instead during editing, and then he didn't tell anyone, including Adrien Brody, who showed up to the premier to find he was hardly in the film. I really wish Terrence Malick would either allow a real writer to shape the narrative or just become a cinematographer, because he is very talented at putting stunning images on the screen, but can not tell a good story to save his life.\n3.5 Beards Out Of 5",

The film met the extremely high expectations it had but it was overshadow by Spielberg´s \"Saving Private Ryan\". Was the long gap between films worth it? Is \"The Thin Red Line\" Malick´s ultimate masterpiece? \nThe film tells a fictionalized version of the Battle Guadalcanal during World War II \nTerrence Malick is one of those directors that are not for everybody thanks to his unique and peculiar style so I approached this film not knowing what to expect from a war film with said style and after three hours I have to say that the result was mixed.  \"The Thin Red Line\" counts with a gigantic cast filled with quality actors and most of them deliver a solid performance with the little screen time given, with the best being Nick Nolte and Ben Chaplin; the locations are gorgeous, beautiful cinematography, Malick´s trademark themes are handle so well that they overshadow the story, intense battle sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat, a perfect use of dialog, an amazing score by Hans Zimmer, impressive and memorable visuals, the story is simple but works completely, Malick´s directing is mostly great by delivering his trademark complex surreal style, and it offers a thought provoking experience. But even with all those phenomenal elements, \"The Thin Red Line\" has numerous problems. The cast is so big and filled with recognizable and talented actors that when a one of them appears on screen for the first time it distracts you from the experience; the film´s pacing is uneven, Malick´s ambition and trademarks don't completely work in a World War II setting, despite the film´s long running time it feels that you just watched an incomplete film, and Malick directing is so unfocused on the story and characters that at times makes it hard to follow. \n\"The Thin Red Line\" is a memorable film that is masterfully made but sadly it doesn't know where to focus on and it suffers from serious pacing issues. This is one of the most beautiful, realistic and memorable World War II films I ever seen. It is by no means Malick´s masterpiece but instead a beautiful and flawed film but in this case the strengths completely outweigh the weakness.",

The cast is friggin outstanding with many A-listers in bit-parts and up-and-comers in more central roles, Elias Koteas and Nick Nolte being the highlights. The battle sequences are straight-up amazing, the camera weaving in between the carnage like a dance that impressed me beyond measure. The award-winning music is used to great effect and the main song \"Journey to the Line\" has been used in pop culture for dramatic heft ever since. Malick presented an engaging war drama that even though had production issues and Malick himself re-wrote the script so many times that prominent actors' parts were reduced or completely cut out; it's stood the test of time and excels in its realistic battle sequences.",

The Thin Red Line is a poorly edited, confusingly shot mess with one of the great Hans Zimmer's most forgettable soundtracks (although you have to wonder if Malick didn't just edit that out along the way). As has been stated by many, Malick has no editing or writing skills and the simplistic dialogue, poor character development and uneven tone reflect this. Several of his big name stars barely make it into the film, cut out or cut down by the editing of a drugged out wannabe artist. The film spends copious amounts of time on tonally awkward reflection shots and unnecessary voiceover, which Malick uses predictably whenever he has any character say anything he considers to be profound (essentially any piece of low level high school poetry). It takes nearly the entire film to even get to a coherent scene and even then, Malick's accuracy is dubious at best (Google works really well, I promise) and his inability to show blood and gore cuts the stakes right out of the scene. Unlike his betters in Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan, Malick simply cannot portray realistic violence. The film only approaches realism briefly near the end, after one has completely lost interest. Even his best faces are crippled by the awful dialogue and what one can only assume is a complete lack of involved directing from Malick. The film is so forgettable that checking out for 15 or even 30 minutes won't lead to any significant confusion. Worst of all, the real struggles of the Guadacanal, the disease, the air battles, the Japanese counterattacks and supply issues, are mostly glossed over in favor of Malick's only singular focus throughout the film.

The Thin Red Line has an impressive lineup of stars including Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, John Cusack, Adrien Brody, John C. Reilly, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, George Clooney, just to name a few. Although the film doesn't exactly specify who the main protaganist, Jim Caviezel and Sean Penn share the most screen time, and ultimately steal the show. \n\nThe one thing that sets The Thin Red Line apart from other contemporary war films is its philosophical viewpoint. All throughout the film there are voice-overs (from Caviezel's and Nick Nolte's characters in particular), that talk about the meaning of life and death, the origin of love, and the capricious violence of nature. These voice-overs soften the blow of the on-screen violence, and accompanied by the gorgeous cinematography of the rainforests of Queensland, Australia, plus Hans Zimmers uniquely beautiful score, the film focuses on the consequences, aftermath and the emotion of the violence we see, rather than the barbarity itself. \n\nSome of the philosophical passages may become tiresome, and at times it seems that they're just trying to confuse you with eloquent language and abstract ideas. This is justified by the strong, authentic performances from its stars (Caviezel in particular), and the engaging dialect between the soldiers. This is a visually stunning, decidadly human epic that stops just before it becomes too much.",

            "content": "It takes years and sometimes a decade to appreciate some war dramas. Such a movie is The Thin Red Line. A triumph of content over action, style over special effects and philosophy over heroic war propaganda, this Terrence Malick surrealistic classic is a fascinating depiction of the contradictions in life, human violence and human ethics. \n\nFor about three hours, The Thin Red Line shows two hallucinogenic days of fighting, death, human ambitions, compassion, duty and it works as a sort of lyrical essay on war and the meaning of life. This is what actually makes The Thin Red Line stand out among the countless numbers of World War II movies. Dressed as a war drama, it is a typical Terrence Malick philosophical essay which blends different characters, ambitions and believes, while depicting the beauty and simplicity of nature and Polynesian life. Every single character is a complex human being, with his own vision on personal existence and life, with his own understandings of moral and ethics. And all of them are combined into this powerful, intimate and hallucinating depiction of war.\n\nWith such an impressive cast, the expectations for The Thin Red Line could be very different if one is not familiar with Terrence Malick's style. The presence of Travolta, Clooney, Harrelson, Penn, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack, Jared Leto, Nick Nolte might seem as a prerequisite for a great action, but they are performing in line with Malick's concept.  Not only content-wise, but also technically, The Thin Red Line is a challenging cinematographic experience. With the endless grass fields and the camera \"surfing\" just above this green grass ocean, with no enemy visible and so little needed for someone to die, one could not escape the claustrophobic and depressing feeling of being actually part of the war.\n\nLooking back in time, it took me 15 years to completely appreciate the greatness of this movie. One of the best  all time WW II movies, The Thin Red Line offers an exquisite cinematographic and provoking philosophical experience  which might not match the taste of the mainstream audiences, but it has already won its place among the greatest war movies ever.",

A very loose adaptation of James Jones' novel (in fact the film adaptation may actually bear more of a resemblance to Norman Mailer's World War II novel the Naked and the Dead), Malick has his camera men pay more attention to the beautiful surroundings of the Pacific, rather than so much the atrocities of war. It's a daring tactic for a mainstream Hollywood war film, but it gives the film a great sense of meditation, even during its battle scenes. Still, the film skimps on character development due to it having such a large cast and an unwieldily running time, and it's clear that initially Malick planned to flesh the story out a bit more. As with almost all of Malick's projects, hours of footage was cut in the editing room, and the lost material certainly shows in the story-gaps that The Thin Red Line has. That said, The Thin Red Line is a war film unlike most, and might be the strongest of Malick's post-1970s films.",

            "content": "With an ensemble cast lined up, The Thin Red Line sounded like it would be a well-acted war movie.\n\nWith The Thin Red Line, I did not know what to expect in terms of storytelling. I figured that it would be a rather large scale war film due to its large budget, the big ensemble cast and the fact that it runs for a total of 171 minutes. Of course as I expected, this also meant that it succumbed to a slow pace. Although the pace of the film is rather organic and it does not feel as if it is rushing anywhere, The Thin Red Line moves along very slowly at a pace which may end up fazing some viewers. \nOccasionally, it feels as if The Thin Red Line jumps back and forth between the bigger picture and the smaller picture. The Thin Red Line is an ambitious challenge for Terrence Malick because it intends to be bother a big scale focus on World War II and one that focuses deeply on a large group of characters. This is a challenge that filmmakers can rarely get right, but Terrence Malick adopts his own way of doing it. In The Thin Red Line, the focus is on the characters during battle which it manages to get right. It shows how they deal with the harsh reality of the situation both physically and mentally, and it ranges from depicting the fighting soldiers to the people giving the orders and how all of them reluctantly contribute to the battle. But it can be a little overwhelming because there are a lot of characters to remember which can get somewhat confusing as well as the fact that the bigger picture of the war is not explained all that much. The Thin Red Line is one of those movies that assumes you have an understanding of everything that is happening before seeing the movie, but as I was not specifically familiar with what part of the war the film was depicting, I walked away from it rather confused. The story itself is not confusing, but the large quantity of characters combined with the lack of sufficient historical context in the story ends up rendering it a rather confusing film in certain retrospects. I don't know what the characters in The Thin Red Line were fighting for, but when you look into it neither did half the characters so the film is able to play that off well. But it boils down to if the viewer finds the film to be organically paced or just plain slow. I felt a bit of both, and I found that the film had certain poetic messages in it yet the pace of the film unfolded quite a lot of repetition amongst the plotting. The Thin Red Line was an ok film in the end for me, but I found that it was too focused on attempting to characterise a lot of figures that it ended up only lightly touching upon all of them. This was not too bad as it reminded us just how many people were shattered by the horrors of WWII, but it didn't end up being as deep as it wanted to be and so the focus for the film was a little scattered all over the place in the end. The characters in the film were good, but the narrative ended up being poor as a whole. All in all, The Thin Red Line didn't have too much of a great story to tell, but a lot of characters to tell it with and so it is an imperfect, slow and long film.\nThe scenery of the film is brilliant. Even though The Thin Red Line was shot in Queensland, Australia, it is completely convincing as having a South Pacific setting. It has a certain level of colour, but the war atmosphere of the film makes it all feel grim and dirty. But more importantly, it is captured with genuinely amazing cinematography. The cinematography in The Thin Red Line is excellent because of how it captures the facial expressions of the characters, the landscape of the setting and the feel of the battle all at once. The Thin Red Line is full of strong visual elements which establish the setting of the film and the timeframe, and it constantly ensures that things in the story feel rather genuine while rendering the film a good visual experience.\nThe talents of the ensemble cast do manage to contribute some success to the film.\nJim Caviezel is the standout in The Thin Red Line. Capturing the troubled nature of a soldier lost in the insane mentality of war, Jim Caviezel turns in a performance which is easy to sympathise for. He delivers his lines as if he has serious internal pain and emotional trauma, and he goes into a state of stoicism which is great. Jim Caviezel gives a performance which essentially reflects a turning point for his career in The Thin Red Line. Jim Caviezel is intense and powerful in his performance which is restrained and yet strong, and delivers his lines with strength and physical emotions well.\nNick Nolte also turns in a screen stealing performance. In the role of Lt. Col. Gordon Tail, Nick Nolte injects in a lot of powerful and intense line delivery into his role which has him gripping the character with powerful tenacity, and so his presence in The Thin Red Line shows off some of his most powerful acting skills. The Thin Red Line is a powerful depiction of Nick Nolte's acting skills, and so his casting is one of the best assets of the film.\nWoody Harrelson's supporting performance is a grim and intense one. Although it is small and brief, he manages to make an impact with his short presence in The Thin Red Line. John Travolta, George Clooney and John Cusack all turn in small roles very nicely as well.\n\nSo while The Thin Red Line suffers from an abundance of ambition, a lack of context and some convoluted storytelling, it remains a realistically violent and well acted depiction of war which has certain importance in the underlying messages.",

            "content": "The general public's view of Malick is polarizing; some praise his work and consider him as a auteur, while others accuse him of being indulgent, pretentious and high minded. I don't really have a general opinion of him as only this film and The Tree of Life are the only films I have seen from him. My first viewing of this film was not pleasant, I felt that it was just too introspective and did not have a driving plot, or at least an interesting or dramatic one, that gripped me. A few months later I decided to give this another try and see if it's able to change mind. In a way it did but at the same time, it's previous flaws are still prevalent but at least much more tolerable and clearer with the second viewing.\n\nThe film was based on the book by James Jones, who also wrote From Here To Eternity, and the screenplay was written by Terrence Malick. I have not read the novel so I cannot say whether or not this film is accurate or that it approaches the same way that the film does. Malick's screenplay on the other hand is a hit or miss for me. There are moments that are brilliant and definitely makes it stand out against the other WWII films, but there are also aspects of the screenplay that didn't just work with me. The main issue that I have with this film is that it is too introspective, which I don't mind as long as there is an interesting plot to drive when the voice overs are not present. A little over half of the film is driven by a main plot but then the last hour and 20 minutes is more of self-reflection and each main character's perspective of the situation. The screenplay contains themes of faith, life, death, war, peace, love, sacrifice and family. It may seem too much but each theme is very much interrelated and one dialogue from a character could sometimes be ambiguous that it could mean this or that. I wish that the last half of the film can hold up the intensity and depth that the first half did.\n\nTerrence Malick's direction in this film feel so incoherent and erratic. At one moment intensity occurs but then it just slows down all of a sudden. It isn't as bad as it was in my first viewing but it did still bother me a little during my revisit. This disjointed feeling does throw me off at times but at the same time it makes the film different and unique from the other war films that this film is generally compared to. True, sometimes I do wish that it does have that excitement and physical intensity of a film like Saving Private Ryan but at the same time I wish other war films had this deep and self-critical view of the war and it's soldiers. His work here may not be perfect and far from his magnum opus, The Tree of Life, but it has grown and improved on me that I am now confident in coming back to this film knowing that it has this great quality that other films don't.\n\nThe film's photography was handled by John Toll, worked on films like Braveheart, Tropic Thunder, The Last Samurai and The Adjustment Bureau. Malick is a director who loves natural photography exposing the beauty in nature and the use of natural light to fill the scene. I am one of those who come into a Malick film expecting beautiful photography but this film just doesn't get up there, this is due to the fact that I have seen Malick's work with Emmanuel Lubezki and the films they do together are breathtakingly gorgeous. Toll's work here may not rank up with Lubezki's but it does get the job done. There is still beauty in his photography, the scenes in the hill in particular, and it does still get the job done when it comes to putting Malick's script in picture. Toll's photography is much deeper in my opinion than Lubezki's, and it makes sense given that this film is more about experience and feelings rather than plot and visceral focused. I do wish that it was more surrealistic but I guess that it's just asking too much as the film's setting and plot is quite grounded to reality.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Hans Zimmer. Before when I just started to really care about films, I used to think Hans Zimmer is the greatest film composer of all time but as time went on I have been exposed to the works of other composers who can rival his work. Not to say that Zimmer is now crap to me but I just started to see the areas in his work that I consider as faults. Zimmer's score for The Thin Red Line is great, it does what it does and it is able to get an emotional response from the audience. However there are moments that I felt needed a little more emotional kick from his score as the situation felt grand and important. Also I picked up that his works on multiple films have a similar sound, or at least a trademark of sorts. This kind of disappointed me as he could have given his later films a much more original style rather than coming back to what he has already used. His later works still are effective though for those films. Do I think The Thing Red Line is his best work? I think not but it is definitely nowhere near his worst.\n\nThe film's cast is extensive and bloated, in a good way. I don't mind that characters just all of a sudden come in and play a small role but there are multiple moments in the film that felt like the scene needed a little more time and a much more subtle way in introducing it's characters. Maybe it's due to the fact that Malick cut around 2 and a half of it's original running time. I did wish that the film did have a central character that we would follow for the most part and have little side moments with the others but what he has done with the final cut is good enough. The entire cast in this film were great, they took their roles to heart and gave it their all. This made the film much more believable and also made the introspection aspect of it much more interesting than what it already is. Stand out performances include Caviezel, Nolte, Harrelson, Koteas, Chaplin and Otto.\n\nThis maybe the favorite of the general audience when it comes to Malick's work but for me it just didn't hit that mark. This may grow on me further on subsequent viewings but for now I can only say that this is good war film that deserves to be watched at least once as it has a large cast, great photography, a moving score and interesting direction from Malick.",

The story of a group of Americans fighting in Guadalcanal, Terrence Malick, in his direction, manages not only to delve into the horrors of war but also illuminate the most basic yet profound questions of human existence. Is God real, and what is His nature? Is man inherently good, or evil? How does both the beautiful and the ugly coexist in ourselves and our world? \"Thin Red Line\" is a marvel of juxtapositions, continually revealing the paradoxical nature of our existence.

In 1998's \"Thin Red Line\" he juggles a herculean amount. Malick's always worked in huge arcs, so he doesn't struggle much with the minutiae. Each different narration in \"The Thin Red Line\" is concerned with the trust and power that allows war to happen, where murder -- the ultimate sin, it tells us -- can be committed scot-free, and is even rewarded. \n\nHow can the powers that be, that MADE being, also allow to exist the powers that destroy it? All the voiceovers clash with this idea in mind, and it's grippingly beautiful. This is the movie that put Malick back on the map, by being totally not rushed and ambitious as fuck. There are certain moments where Malick loses focus in the sweeping 170-minute runtime, but that's nitpicking a thin line that feels oh so bold. (93/100)",

            "content": "The general public's view of Malick is polarizing; some praise his work and consider him as a auteur, while others accuse him of being indulgent, pretentious and high minded. I don't really have a general opinion of him as only this film and The Tree of Life are the only films I have seen from him. My first viewing of this film was not pleasant, I felt that it was just too introspective and did not have a driving plot, or at least an interesting or dramatic one, that gripped me. A few months later I decided to give this another try and see if it's able to change mind. In a way it did but at the same time, it's previous flaws are still prevalent but at least much more tolerable and clearer with the second viewing.\n\nThe film was based on the book by James Jones, who also wrote From Here To Eternity, and the screenplay was written by Terrence Malick. I have not read the novel so I cannot say whether or not this film is accurate or that it approaches the same way that the film does. Malick's screenplay on the other hand is a hit or miss for me. There are moments that are brilliant and definitely makes it stand out against the other WWII films, but there are also aspects of the screenplay that didn't just work with me. The main issue that I have with this film is that it is too introspective, which I don't mind as long as there is an interesting plot to drive when the voice overs are not present. A little over half of the film is driven by a main plot but then the last hour and 20 minutes is more of self-reflection and each main character's perspective of the situation. The screenplay contains themes of faith, life, death, war, peace, love, sacrifice and family. It may seem too much but each theme is very much interrelated and one dialogue from a character could sometimes be ambiguous that it could mean this or that. I wish that the last half of the film can hold up the intensity and depth that the first half did.\n\nTerrence Malick's direction in this film feel so incoherent and erratic. At one moment intensity occurs but then it just slows down all of a sudden. It isn't as bad as it was in my first viewing but it did still bother me a little during my revisit. This disjointed feeling does throw me off at times but at the same time it makes the film different and unique from the other war films that this film is generally compared to. True, sometimes I do wish that it does have that excitement and physical intensity of a film like Saving Private Ryan but at the same time I wish other war films had this deep and self-critical view of the war and it's soldiers. His work here may not be perfect and far from his magnum opus, The Tree of Life, but it has grown and improved on me that I am now confident in coming back to this film knowing that it has this great quality that other films don't.\n\nThe film's photography was handled by John Toll, worked on films like Braveheart, Tropic Thunder, The Last Samurai and The Adjustment Bureau. Malick is a director who loves natural photography exposing the beauty in nature and the use of natural light to fill the scene. I am one of those who come into a Malick film expecting beautiful photography but this film just doesn't get up there, this is due to the fact that I have seen Malick's work with Emmanuel Lubezki and the films they do together are breathtakingly gorgeous. Toll's work here may not rank up with Lubezki's but it does get the job done. There is still beauty in his photography, the scenes in the hill in particular, and it does still get the job done when it comes to putting Malick's script in picture. Toll's photography is much deeper in my opinion than Lubezki's, and it makes sense given that this film is more about experience and feelings rather than plot and visceral focused. I do wish that it was more surrealistic but I guess that it's just asking too much as the film's setting and plot is quite grounded to reality.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Hans Zimmer. Before when I just started to really care about films, I used to think Hans Zimmer is the greatest film composer of all time but as time went on I have been exposed to the works of other composers who can rival his work. Not to say that Zimmer is now crap to me but I just started to see the areas in his work that I consider as faults. Zimmer's score for The Thin Red Line is great, it does what it does and it is able to get an emotional response from the audience. However there are moments that I felt needed a little more emotional kick from his score as the situation felt grand and important. Also I picked up that his works on multiple films have a similar sound, or at least a trademark of sorts. This kind of disappointed me as he could have given his later films a much more original style rather than coming back to what he has already used. His later works still are effective though for those films. Do I think The Thing Red Line is his best work? I think not but it is definitely nowhere near his worst.\n\nThe film's cast is extensive and bloated, in a good way. I don't mind that characters just all of a sudden come in and play a small role but there are multiple moments in the film that felt like the scene needed a little more time and a much more subtle way in introducing it's characters. Maybe it's due to the fact that Malick cut around 2 and a half of it's original running time. I did wish that the film did have a central character that we would follow for the most part and have little side moments with the others but what he has done with the final cut is good enough. The entire cast in this film were great, they took their roles to heart and gave it their all. This made the film much more believable and also made the introspection aspect of it much more interesting than what it already is. Stand out performances include Caviezel, Nolte, Harrelson, Koteas, Chaplin and Otto.\n\nThis maybe the favorite of the general audience when it comes to Malick's work but for me it just didn't hit that mark. This may grow on me further on subsequent viewings but for now I can only say that this is good war film that deserves to be watched at least once as it has a large cast, great photography, a moving score and interesting direction from Malick.",

            "content": "It takes years and sometimes a decade to appreciate some war dramas. Such a movie is The Thin Red Line. A triumph of content over action, style over special effects and philosophy over heroic war propaganda, this Terrence Malick surrealistic classic is a fascinating depiction of the contradictions in life, human violence and human ethics. \nFor about three hours, The Thin Red Line shows two hallucinogenic days of fighting, death, human ambitions, compassion, duty and it works as a sort of lyrical essay on war and the meaning of life. This is what actually makes The Thin Red Line stand out among the countless numbers of World War II movies. Dressed as a war drama, it is a typical Terrence Malick philosophical essay which blends different characters, ambitions and believes, while depicting the beauty and simplicity of nature and Polynesian life. Every single character is a complex human being, with his own vision on personal existence and life, with his own understandings of moral and ethics. And all of them are combined into this powerful, intimate and hallucinating depiction of war.\nWith such an impressive cast, the expectations for The Thin Red Line could be very different if one is not familiar with Terrence Malick's style. The presence of Travolta, Clooney, Harrelson, Penn, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, John Cusack, Jared Leto, Nick Nolte might seem as a prerequisite for a great action, but they are performing in line with Malick's concept.  Not only content-wise, but also technically, The Thin Red Line is a challenging cinematographic experience. With the endless grass fields and the camera \"surfing\" just above this green grass ocean, with no enemy visible and so little needed for someone to die, one could not escape the claustrophobic and depressing feeling of being actually part of the war.\nLooking back in time, it took me 15 years to completely appreciate the greatness of this movie. One of the best  all time WW II movies, The Thin Red Line offers an exquisite cinematographic and provoking philosophical experience  which might not match the taste of the mainstream audiences, but it has already won its place among the greatest war movies ever.",

You feel the weight of the loss of every life, regardless of what side they're on. I personally don't agree with the notion that most of the main characters are too similar. Or rather, I don't think it is unintentional or erroneous. Like Full Metal Jacket, this movie shows the way that the military (quite deliberately) promotes collectivism by making soldiers shave and cut their hair the same way, dress the same way, speak in unison, etc. But even so, I still say there are plenty of standouts among the cast.",

There's a blissful lack of cohesiveness in his work; they move like poems rather than typical narrative stories.\n\nTHE THIN RED LINE is his best film, in my opinion. He does something in this film that no other war story has been brave enough to do: he values feeling above history. This isn't a war film, because a war film is about the war itself; this is a film about what the human condition looks like in the midst of war.\n\nThere isn't any moral high ground in this film, because, I believe, that Malick has taken the stance that there is no moral high ground in war, there is only the taking of life; there is only destruction and death, not life and love. Malick's interpretation of THE THIN RED LINE is as morally ambiguous a World War II film as you are likely to ever see.\n\nBeing a believer, I feel that our war mongering society has destroyed itself and attempted to destroy the godly principals that this nation was founded on. War used to be a last resort to protect people from harm or a greater evil, not a means of displaying power. It's nice to see that Mr. Malick feels the same way.\n\nSimply put, this is a masterpiece that rivals war films the world over.",

            "content": "When my Mother passed away, it was a shock, and I was very confused and frightened. I had no idea how to handle it or how I was even supposed to feel. I had a lot of sadness, and I didn't know what to do with any of it. The first time I ever saw The Thin Red Line was one week after I lost my Mother. The Thin Red Line is a war film, but it is an art film above all else. The Thin Red Line is 'a thought-provoking mediation on man, nature, and violence'. I had no idea what I was in for.\n\nOne of the very first pieces of dialogue is spoken by a character named Pvt. Witt.\n\nHe says, \"I remember my mother when she was dying, she was all shrunk up and grey. I asked her if she was afraid, she shook her head no. I was afraid to touch the death I seen in her. I couldn't find nothing beautiful or uplifting about her going back to God. I wondered what it'd be like when I died, to know that this was the last breath you was ever going to draw. I just hoped I could meet it with the same calm she did. Cause that's where it's hidden. The immortality I hadn't seen.\"\n\nThe emotional toll this film would put me through would be immense, something I have never felt before or will ever feel again. The Thin Red Line spoke to me in a way a piece of art has never spoken to me before. Jim Caviezel, the actor who played Pvt. Witt, delivered a performance and created a character that changed my life. I have never identified closer with a film character before. 'Identified' isn't even the right word for it, an out-of-body experience is more accurate. It was unreal. The film had an almost therapeutic effect on me, without me even knowing it, I was sorting myself out. I was getting better.\n\nThe film itself is pure poetry, the film is brilliant. Terrence Malick's best. The ensemble cast the films boasts redefines the term 'star studded'. Jim Caviezel, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte, John Travolta, George Clooney, John Cusack, Jared Leto, Nick Stahl, Adrien Brody, John C. Rielly, Woody Harrelson, and Sean Penn are only but a handful of the wonderful actors you will find in this film. The film displays the best use of voice-overs that I have ever seen. The Thin Red Line is a one-of-a-kind picture, and one that you must open yourself up to completely. Malick is a master of film, and The Thin Red Line is the strongest evidence to support that claim. The Thin Red Line will change the way you think about and view films. It will open your eyes to a whole new world of possibilities. That world is Malick's vision.\n\nI am still in awe. What The Thin Red Line did for me is almost hard to completely grasp. It didn't make everything better, it is my girlfriend and my family who helped me finally heal. The Thin Red Line put me on the road to recovery, and that in and of itself is a wholly remarkable thing for a film to do for a person. The Thin Red Line changed me forever.\n\nThis is a film that wants to speak to to you. Listen.",

            "content": "The circumstances around Terence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE are sometimes more talked about than the film itself. The reclusive director had made a big splash in the Seventies, but there followed two decades of silence. When he finally reappeared in 1998 to direct this adaptation of James Jones's novel about the Battle of Guadalcanal in World War II, many actors were desperate to work with him and he was able to gather a large ensemble cast. He shot over five hours of footage but had to cut it down to three, leaving out many actors entirely from the finished version.\n\nTHE THIN RED LINE tells of the American battle against Japanese forces on the island from the landing on its beach to the time the initial troops are relieved and sail off for some new, unknown deployment. But it actually begins shortly before this when Private Witt (Jim Caviezel), who has been AWOL and living with the local Melanesian people on a nearby island, is discovered by a patrol and brought in before his sargeant. The battle itself involves the men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division: besides Caviezel as Witt, major roles are played by Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody and Ben Chaplin. Elias Koteas is Capt. Staros, who tries to look out for his men, while a hyperbolic Nick Nolte plays their commander who seems the troops as nothing but cannon fodder to wrecklessly throw at the Japanese. \n\nFor most of its 3-hour length, the men are torn apart by Japanese machine gun fire as they try to take a hill, but the enemy is never directly seen. Between scenes of great violence, there are portentous voiceovers by various characters as they meditate on what war says about the larger human drama. Eventually US forces are able to overcome Japanese positions, and the Japanese side of the offensive is depicted with more fairness and equanimity than in most American films on the Pacific Theatre of the war.\n\nWhile the realistic depiction of battle might touch viewers -- and its hard to knock any World War II film since they spur one to read more about this crucial event in history, this is not a great film. It has obviously been cut heavily from its original length. John C. Reilly appears several times at the centre of shots, clearly meant to be a major character, but most of his scenes and all of his back story were cut. The philosophic voiceovers come across as pretentious instead of insightful. Furthermore, I find this a very \"Hollywood\" film, with the acting often exaggerated. Woody Harrelson doesn't play a WWII grunt, he plays Woody Harrelson. George Clooney appears as an officer at the end and all realism goes out the window: there's no way this suave, handsome leading man has been fighting a war for some time now. Hans Zimmer's musical score too obviously pulls the audience towards prescribed emotions.",

The film has nice visuals and the capture of hill 201 is good, but overall \"The Thin Red Line\" is an insult to veterans, to anyone who has known war. It is a cheat to serious movie goers. It is hiding the truth. If you wish to watch war films with greater genuine depth, aside from \"Come and see\", prefer Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon or Paths of Glory.",

Unfortunately most of the rest of the (rather large) cast doesn't seem to find that same tone. Some actors were more jarring than others.

This existential piece of art follows man in WWII as he crumbles in his own abyss of personal grief and pain that also mixes with the various horrors of war itself. The cinematography and fluid camerawork had me at 'Hello' taking me on a harrowing journey through soldiers souls and the trust they have to share with each other during the Battle of Guadalcanal. You see each of the soldiers unravel, whether it's the most calm man or the most frightened man, and you understand why. They've either left their jobs or who they love at home to fight for their country, but that pride that they first had has been replaced by fear and that's what the main theme is during the duration of the film. I felt for these men so much, and the film succeeded very well in the emotional department. All the actors did a great job in this film, and it was fun to find out who was in the film also, because some only get small cameos and you're kinda confused about why they were in the movie. The way they exude fear during the hill scene is amazing and that's also a credit to Terrence Malick, because he used nature in its most beautiful scenery to place fear in these men. Nature was also a big part of this film, and how it all related to the soldier's will to survive. Some knew they were going to die, and they took in the most beautiful looks at nature before they left the world, and I thought John  Toll did an awesome job showcasing nature at its finest.

Culminated with an extended 20 year hiatus, Malick garnered something of a phantom mystique, and for many this was wrapped in the esteem of Hollywood's greatest filmmaking auteurs. His return to the directors chair was met with an insatiable eagerness by studio executives out to make a mark on the 1998 award season, and fortunately this allowed Malick a blank cheque for budget, cast and creative control. Anything, anywhere or anyone he wanted for his vision, he got. \n\nThe result is a profound modern allegory on war, and one of the most important pieces of American cinema ever made.\n\nThe challenge it presents to the viewer is obvious from the opening frame. Scenes are often scattered and disconnected, characters are disposable and narratively removed, and there's no definable story ark. Long philosophical voiceovers that may provide needed insight are often mumbled and overtly abstract, and flashbacks often confound more than they provide exposition. \n\nIt's a bold, daring piece of cinema that unapologetically ignores convention. And it's infinitely better for it.\n\nSet in the World War II conflict between incumbent Japanese forces and an advancing US battalion, Malick serves as a tour guide to the internal and external tribulations of war. He draws parallels to nature and wants us to consider the significance war has for our species. What's the point of it? What does it say about us, about men? \n\nMost war films are primarily concerned with destruction, and though The Thin Red Line has a wide spread of virtues, the battle scenes are at least as compelling as any I've seen. Long panning shots take us deep into the thick of violence, gliding in and out of explosions and gunfire alongside frantic soldiers more desperate to survive than to kill. In one scene, two of them advance up a hill to scout an area and are suddenly shot by an unseen enemy. Once they fall, all becomes quiet, and the remaining troops look on with a fearful apprehension. Cloud cover clears and sunlight slowly sweeps across the hillside where they were once standing. All is quiet, and the contrasting beauty makes the statement that much more profound. \n\nMalick isn't just a filmmaker, he's a philosophical poet. We may find difficulty in accessing his message at the literal level, particularly on a first viewing, but it's hard to deny the emotional power and beauty of his presentation. Removed from plot, the combination of narrative lyricism, visual poetry and Hans Zimmer's unbelievably powerful score makes the work feel more like a meditation than a movie. \n\n\"What difference do you think you can make, one single man in all this madness? If you die, it's gonna be for nothing. There's not some other world out there where everything's gonna be okay. \n\nThere's just this world. Just this rock\"\n\nSergeant Welsh's short but classic speech to Private Witt amidst a desecrated battlefield is perhaps the most telling of all. \n\nThe eloquent and thoughtful monologues of the cast have been subject to criticism, with many feeling them to be unrealistically deep-thinking for young soldiers, so I want you to consider the alternative: If you were really sent to war, to kill other people you've never met, and find yourself under the imminent threat of death, what would be going through your head? Really think about it. What psychological impact would war have on you? \n\nIt's important to remember the film is set in 1942 - long before our use of the English language was degradated by SMS and online social media, when being articulate was a basic skill rather than a sign of intelligence. The film was first introduced to me by a veteran of the Vietnam war, and like many real soldiers of earlier eras, he said it was more representative of the turmoils they faced than anything else he'd seen.\n\nConscripted warfare isn't full of cigar-smoking patriots with their chests puffed out, it's full of fearful and conflicted men being forced to directly face their own mortality. \n\nThe Thin Red Line is a meditative commentary on our darkest behaviour painted over a canvas of nature and human existentialism. Aesthetically beautiful, emotionally charged and thematically profound, it's more than a masterpiece of cinema, it's a masterpiece of our culture.",

While his style has since become more and more ethereal and abstract, this is one of Malick's more approachable and eventful films. Its philosophical contemplations aren't as arduous and mind-numbing, there are actors who actually have something to do, and Malick focuses on the themes of the nature of war and inner conflicts instead of just prancing around with his camera. That isn't to say that the film doesn't look stunning (like all of Malick's films); John Toll's cinematography perfectly captures the horrors on the battlefield, but also the beauty of the environment the war ravages, and Hans Zimmer's somewhat uncharacteristic (but magnificent) score highlights the atmosphere. The cast is once again enormous, with actors like John Travolta, George Clooney and Adrien Brody (whose character was supposed to be one of the most prominent ones) getting only a few lines of dialogue, while the likes of Mickey Rourke and Martin Sheen were completely cut out. Only Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas and Sean Penn get to do something with their roles. But as usual, the actors are more just bystanders who surround the films ambitious themes. But as thoughtful and beautiful as The Thin Red Line is, in the end its message is the old same one: war is hell. That seems to be the only thing that war films can ever say, but in cases like this it's more about how you tell it. The Thin Red Line is the film to do it in the most enchanting way since Apocalypse Now.",

As a young kid I didn't know or understand much about movies back then. Let alone heard about Terrence Malick. But I remember I was mezmerized by the poetic narrative, the serene pictures of nature and the warmth with which some of the characters, mainly Witt and his relationship with the native Melanesians, were displayed. \n\nWhen the closing credits were rolling I remember someone behind me cursing, seemingly bored and infuriated by the three hour session he had just gone through, that this should have been three different movies: a nature documentary, a romantic chick flick and a war film. Obviously he had come to see only one: the war flick. And I, I had come to see a good film by this enigmatic director who had been lost for 20 years. Sitting there, reflecting the film and listening this guy behind me, I realised I had seen one of the best war films ever made.\n\nNow, seeing it the second time not much has changed. I had forgotten a lot from the movie but was still mezmerized by Malick's poetic images and his naturalistic / romantic / humanistic take on mankinds darkest hours. It remains one of the best war films ever made.",

We don't follow one specific character, rather delve into the thoughts and minds of many, as we follow different forms of thought and crisis each soldier probably faces during war time. Malick's least concern is to have a traditional narrative; for him, it's far more involving and effective to follow the disjointedness and messiness that war brings about in human nature, and the rather beautiful poetry that permeates the air that only an artist like Malick would dare delve into. John Toll's cinematography is both destructive and alluring-- with each step bringing us closer to a certain doom or fate each character will have, and just the epic-scale Toll sets with his camera is remarkable and attention-grabbing. It may appear to be directionless and meandering, but in a sense, so is war. There is no definitive point to where war can go, and in Malick's eyes, war is more thought-provoking and complex than to mold into a straight narrative.",

While Malick is limited to the ocean and an island, the cinematography is constantly refreshing, and by the end of the film, I felt like I knew the island itself just as well as I knew the soldiers. I'd also like to note that the large cast of recognizable actors works in this movie's favor. Yes, there are characters that are focused on, but the rest of the supporting cast is seen just enough so that you feel for each of them. I think the long running time is certainly warranted, but The Thin Red Line just isn't consistently engaging enough for me to call it one of the best war dramas I've ever seen - it's still well worth your time, though.",

His film considers the war that exists between earthly and metaphysical ideals, between existence and transcendence, between acceptance and searching. With only Badlands in 1973 and Days of Heaven in 1978 behind him, Malick returned after a twenty year hiatus from filmmaking in 1998 with one of the most daring and artful productions ever achieved by a major studio. Malick, an enigmatic and legendary presence in cinema, embraces transcendentalist themes to question the ways in which Nature and war are inescapable truths of existence, but in turn refuses to answer such questions within the film, demanding viewers search themselves for answers...\r\n\r\nRead the full article here: \r\nhttp://www.deepfocusreview.com/reviews/thinredline.asp",

All of the grass level filming, where you can't really see the enemy... claustrophic and metaphoric at the same time.  This is the zen of war - the film really puts you right there, letting you see all the casualties and conflicts and letting you decide which path you would take if you were \"enlisted\".\r\n\r\nFine performances abound, and I found Nick Nolte's Colonel Tall to be an awesome portrayal.  \r\n\r\n14 years have passed with this film, and I found it fun to see all the actors who just \"show up\" in cameo roles, like John Travolta and George Clooney.\r\n\r\nMy only real complaints about this film have to do with pacing and length.  At 3 hours, there certainly was ample opportunity for some judicious editing (many a scene, especially the flashbacks and more surreal material, could have been shortened) - which would have given a tighter narrative; but even that wouldn't have covered the big \"breather\" that the film takes about 3/4 of the way through.  After the hill is taken and Charly Co returns to base camp, the film loses all momentum dealing with the aftermath of the campaign, which makes the then repositioning of the company up river under new and incompetent command, seem a superflous tag - a feeling compounded by the sacrifice made by the film's narrator and \"soul\".  Better if the film would have left out this portion of the film entirely and cut to the company leaving Guadacanal on the LCV.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of these obvious missteps, the film is compelling, and its ruminations on the origin of evil and mankind's loss of harmony make this film a must see.",

The film manages the impressive feat of being sympathetic to both sides of the conflict despite focusing almost entirely on the Americas, with the scenes in the Japanese camp counting among the film's best. A subplot involving one of the soldier's wives who wants a divorce is disruptive and would have been better left on the cutting room floor. Malick's signature use of voiceovers is also at its most frustrating here, relying on so many that it is often to differentiate between them. Still, whatever its faults, the film is a dazzling feat of direction and is visually wondrous to behold.",

This is a film about nature, life, death and human crisis. \"The Thin Red Line\" is also one of the more effective anti-war films around. Not as decided as say, \"Grand Illusion,\" but certainly resonant in it's own right. This is not a film for everyone. If you want a flag waving, bravo war picture, \"Saving Private Ryan\" will do the trick (obviously, since that film overshadowed almost every aspect of \"The Thin Red Line\" when both were released in 1998).

Reilly, Jared Leto, Travolta, Koteas, Tim Blake Nelson, Thomas Jane, Nick Stahl and Terrence Malick at the helm.",

            "content": "\"So you shall come to look at the world with new eyes\" Ralph Waldo Emerson\r\n   The above quote pretty much sums up my reaction to Terrance Malick's The Thin Red Line.  Is this a war movie from the perspective of an Emersonian philosopher or a film exploring the duality of man in a war setting?  Let's just say it's a thinking man's war film that also has some of the most barbaric scenes of battle I have seen in a film.  \r\n    The film opens with Pvt. Witt (Caviezel) AWOL on a tropical Eden.  He is among the native peoples, unconcerned about war while they frolic in the ocean and catch fish or sing songs as they pick up fallen fruit to eat.  More philosopher than warrior Witt longs to escape from the madness of war and become one with his idyllic paradise.  That is not to be as he is soon found out and returned to his ship for the assault on Guadalcanal.\r\n    The assault on Guadalcanal is going to be led by bombastic Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte).  As we hear inside Talls stream of consciousness we learn he is a career soldier passed over for promotion and itching to prove himself in battle.  Nolte is stellar in this role his, manic blood lusting turn as Lt. Col. Tall is amazing in its earnestness.\r\n    The storming of the beach is anti-climactic.  It has the same run up and tension to the landing and assault as another great war film released that year Saving Private Ryan.  However, where the pitched battle in Spielberg's film sets the table for the rest of the film, Malick's assault gives us little clue about the horror that is about to unfold. \r\n    As the troops move inland they come under machine gun fire from entrenched Japanese positions on the hills above.  Capt. Staros (Koteas) is reluctant to lead his men in a frontal assault of the defended position after his troops suffer tremendous losses.  His superior officer Lt. Col. Tall explodes in glorious fury as he orders a direct assault.  \r\n   How this all plays out I will leave for you to find out for yourself.  I will say that the footage of combat is amazing.  The craziness of the combat, the heroism, banality and horror is laid out before the watcher in stunning fashion.  At the same time Malick interjects stream of conciseness thoughts of a few of the men most notably Witt and Tall.  Some may find these thoughts out of place in the picture.  I found that they only enhanced the film in that we get to see the motivations and thoughts behind the actions.\r\n    The Thin Red Line is also a beautiful picture.  The lush tropical jungle with its blades of grass gently blowing in the wind and drops of dew glittering on the leaves is juxtaposed with shots of Woody Harrelson jumping on a live grenade and a man screaming for mercy with his entrails hanging out.  \r\n   \"How did we lose the good that was given to us, let it slip away scattered and careless?\" Pvt Witt\r\n\r\nI can see why some war movie traditionalists might not care for this picture.  We are all used to seeing the war is hell and we had to do our duty type of film that is a Hollywood standard.  Malick does not take that approach with this film.  Instead he presents us with a complex canvas where war is indeed hell, but we are left to confront our motivations for it.",

Some of the battle scenes depicting Guadalcanal are solid, but this isn't really a war movie at it's heart. The Thin Red Line attempts to be very deep and poetic, though I'm not entirely sure what the director is ultimately getting at. In the same vein as Apocalypse Now, the war raging around the characters in this film serves only as a backdrop to greater \"meaning of life\" questions. While the former movie succeeds in pondering some of these with great success, I'm not sure Thin Red Line delivers. It has it's moments, but in the end it sort of just felt like a muddled mess in need of some serious reediting. Hopefully we will see a \"redux\" version in twenty years!",

            "content": "Probably the most gentle and dream-like war film ever made. Terrence Malick's first film in the twenty years since Days Of Heaven (1978) begins with a young American soldier named Witt (Jim Caviezel) pondering numerous philisophical questions about nature, as he spends his time living with a Melanesian tribe, having gone AWOL from his military division. The days are complete bliss as he swims in the ocean and lives happily with the natives, until an American ocean troop carrier finds him and locks him up. Sean Penn plays Sergeant Welsh who frustratedly lectures him about the amount of times he has abandoned his military, and tells him that he's cut a deal so he will not be court-martialed for the incident, and he must merely act as a stretcher bearer on the upcoming battle. It is World War 2. This film has arguably the most impressive ensemble cast ever assembled, including Penn, Caviezel, Adrien Brody, Ben Chaplin, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Elias Koteas, Jared Leto, Tim Blake Nelson, Nick Nolte, John C. Reilly, John Savage, John Travolta, Mark Boone Junior and Nick Stahl, among many others. Some of these actors only appear on screen for about a minute (including A-List stars such as Travolta and Clooney), but I would say the three main stars of the film are Penn, Caviezel, and Nolte, despite the fact that we spend large extended periods of the film without seeing them. Most of the film depicts a chaotic battle taking place, which seems like a \"Paths Of Glory\" style suicide mission. The film is criticised widely for two things. Firstly, people say that the dialogue is atrocious, which I just do not understand. I can't give evidence as to why it's good but it's some of the most poetic and spiritual dialogue to ever grace the screen, just like in a lot of Malick's films. Secondly, people simply say it is boring. Of course you'll get bored if you jump in with popcorn and booze expecting an exciting war flick. It's just not about that, it's a philisophical study of characters, nature, and how war can destroy such beauty in the blink of an eye, in a truly man-made way. The opening scenes show true paradise, and throughout the film, whenever an explosion erupts we wince at how destructive it is for the natural surroundings. The one fault I agree with is that the film would have been perfectly ended around the 120 minute mark, however there is another 40 minutes or so after that which seem to just drag it out. All the same, one of the greatest motion pictures of the 1990s, someone who appreciates artistic filmmaking should be in awe of it.",

            "content": "Quite simply, Terrence Malick's \"The Thin Red Line\" is not a movie. I would not even say that this is a \"film.\" \"The Thin Red Line\" is poetry. It is philosophy. It is art. And it is beautiful. On the outset, \"The Thin Red Line\" is about a division during the battle of Guadalcanal that happened during World War II. However, it is more about the war-like nature of \"civilized man.\" Malick starts by showing two soldiers AWOL on an island in the middle of the Pacific and interacting with the people of the island. Everyone is at peace. No one fights. And then they are caught and pretty much thrown into hell. There are many small, memorable roles in this movie. Don't blink or else you will miss John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney, and John Cusack. Sean Penn is great as the bitter, battle weary sergeant who is but isn't Jim Caviezel's best friend. Speaking of which, Jim Caviezel's Private Witt is brilliant. Adrien Brody maybe says five words in the entire movie, but does so much with facial expression. You know what he is thinking. Elias Koteas is also great as the Captain who wants to keep his platoon together and in one piece. My favourite is Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall. He is bitter, driven and, at times, explosive. The real beauty of this \"film\" is in its shots and dream sequences. Malick has a way of portraying landscape and dreams like no other director I know. And it takes a real talent to make these so vivid as Malick does. I realize this \"film\" may not be everyone. But if you see it, relish it for its visual poetry, its directing, and powerful acting.",

Instead, TTRL looks inside each each soldiers mind in a type of James Joyce or William Faulkner-esque stream-of-conciousness. Much of the speaking parts in the film are simply vocal representations of the soldiers' rambling minds.\r\n\r\nThe film has no firm plot, but that only enhances the feeling of disjunction and alienation felt throughout the length of the story. Instead, each actor, each soldier has his own story to tell and his own view on war. In another very Modern technique, the story comes full circle for the protagonist, Pvt. Witt. In the beginning, he states that immortality is found in calmness when facing death, which is what his dying mother experienced. In one of the final scenes, (Spoiler Alert) Witt finds himself surrounded by Japanese soldiers. In a moment of beautiful cinematography, Witt experiences an epiphany of his own mortality and in an acceptance of his own death, raises his gun provoking the Japanese soldiers to shoot and kill him. \r\n\r\nWhen beginning this film, don't expect anything similar to Saving Private Ryan, a movie released around the same time. TTRL is a war movie by definition, but it is so much more.",

            "content": "The Thin Red Line was the first masterpiece that Terrence Malick had created, and to this day i wish I could discover what was going through this incredible directors head to make such a personal and incredible film.  The movie is mainly a war movie, but it is also a movie that tells many different stories about many different soldiers who's lives have been affected by war.  I found this to be a incredibly intense and realistic war movie, also i discovered it was released in 1997 so I'm guessing that must have been the year for great war films with this and Saving Private Ryan.\n\n  The story is based on the book  by James Jones and follows a large group of soldiers and their experiences with world War II.  But it mainly follows their mission to secure a hill held by the Japanese.  This battle was called the Battle of Mount Austen and this is a depiction of the soldiers experiences during the battle. \n\n  The plot is one of the greatest and most incredible plot lines to a war film I have ever seen.  Saving Private Ryan is my favorite war film of all time, but on terms of story I would say this is much greater in characterization and showing the true nature of a soldier.  Saving private Ryan was better in plot and realism, but that is not to say I did not think this film had a bad plot.  In fact it has a truly incredible storyline and was very realistic, but its true genius is in the characters and their different experiences they have and I just simply loved it.  There is something very special about this story, something deep they are trying to teach us about the nature of the human soldier, and I learned very much about them from this incredible masterpiece.\n\n  The cast is a huge list of incredible performances and their really is no main actor because they all have their equal screen time and each did a incredible job.  Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, James Caviezel, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney, John C. Reilly, John Cusack, Ben Chaplin, john Travolta, Nick Nolte, Tim Blake Nelson, and the rest of them were all incredible in my eyes and highly memorable.  It actually is a pretty special thing that I am able to remember each character with their being such a huge cast, and that shows true greatness. \n\n  The war scenes shown were incredibly realistic and made this one of my favorite war films of all time.  They do not use constant explosions to make this some weird Michael Bay war film that is cheesy and just their for cash.  Terrence Malick works hard to make this a realistic and as close a depiction to the Battle of Mount Austen as possible.  I simply loved the beauty and genius put into each scene.\n\n  The music is honestly one of the greatest scores of all time.  Almost this entire film has just incredible music to lead on this story and its incredible characters.  During the war scenes it felt as if I was watching a moving painting due to the art of the music and everything else, just simply beautiful.  I have said it once and I will said a million times again that Hans Zimmer is the worlds greatest music composer.\n\n  The Thin Red Line is a film that is impossible to describe in a few words if you ask me.  If you asked me what its about I will tell have to go on for like 5 minutes to describe the beauty and how it differs from other war films.  This is not a movie just trying to give us a good time, its a movie trying to get a important point across to us.  I believe that the point is that being a soldier will change you, it will teach you respect, the value of life, and the nature of true war.  It is a magical film in a way, I just cannot explain the pure beauty in each scene, the genius in the characters, and incredible direction from a man who has shown us a war film that has never been done before.",

            "content": "About half way through watching writer/director Terrance Malick's \"The Thin Red Line\", I asked myself quietly, \"Does this movie really qualify as a war movie?\" Well, clearly the answer is \"yes,\" but not necessarily in the way that one might expect.\n\"The Thin Red Line\" is set in the WWII battle of Guadalcanal Island, a pivotal event in the history of the war. Yet the goal of the film is not to reenact the battle to the degree of precision which we saw that same year of 1998 in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and his D-day account. No, this is a very different depiction of war indeed. Yes, there is blood and there is something of a body count by the end, but this is just as much, if not more a film about the soul and nature of man, than the often times over emphasized spectacle of war.One of the many key themes of the film is natures war within itself. Throughout the picture we are bombarded with images of the beauty of the natural world which acts almost as a character within the story itself, waiting like a snare to eat the young soldiers up like a lion devours its prey. \nThis, of course, is a highly existentialist concept which is being portrayed. It is the first war film I've ever seen which takes a good 46 minutes before the first shot is ever fired. This is because it is not one of the many guts-and-glory Rambo films which we are so keenly aware. It is not about the kill, but more of what the kill actually means. \nA ways into the film, a young soldier crouches in the brush, looking down the long barrel of his rifle up to the crest of a hill which is closely guarded by Japanese soldiers. After spotting a group of two or three carrying a piece of equipment across it's grassy face, he opens fire, dispensing with three or four bullets in order to pick off the one. His aim is dodgy but his spirit is relentless. The soldier falls to the ground, presumably dead. At this point we enter into the soldiers mind: \"I killed a man. Worse thing you can do. Worse than rape. I killed a man, nobody can touch me for it.\" \nThis is a constant theme which we are reminded of throughout the picture: what does war do to the soul of a man. At some point this beautiful world around us must have gone wrong, somehow. Is this the directors argument for original sin? Perhaps. All that I am aware of is that there is something disjointed in this world which is presented to us. Are these Japanese really the enemy? Or are they men, just like the American's and Allied Forces who have been placed in the middle of a situation which they would rather not be in -- afraid; alone; clinging onto the last tender bits of the conflicted hope that they have. Where does war come from? Who invented the killing of another human being? Who takes pleasure in it enough that they would game of such dire word consequence?\nThis movie gives us no answers. It is not our war, but a war which we watch as does the disembodied camera which floats here and there, passing like a wind over the brush. It is as if G-d is looking down upon this destruction and asking himself, \"Where did things go wrong with this beautiful creation?\" \nYet by its end, I found the film very life affirming. With constant speech concerning the nature of life, and good, and evil, and life after life, I could not help but feel slightly elevated. This film does not preach, it contemplates. It is not a war film, but a meditation on life and the chaos which is produced therein. This is a film which has the courage to be what it wants to be and does not have the need to please an audience, but take the time to challenge the audience. This is a very, very good movie indeed.",

Unfortunately despite the sweeping visuals, Terrence Malick just can't deliver with this one. I was greatly disappointed with The Thin Red Line. The film, despite the fact that it had stunning visuals, really didn't have anything to offer the viewer. Terrence Malick goes for a visual sense of telling the story with minimal dialogue, and unfortunately, it doesn't work, and The Thin Red Line ends up being a boring film with barely any character development or an effective plot development. The fact that it's a three hour film, and that it has nothing to offer considering the fact that the film is a war film set in the Pacific is a great disappointment. If you're expecting a grand war film with great characters, a stunning plot and a constant sense of dread, like with every other war film as the character try to survive their ordeal; you won't get that here. This film is too long, it takes a long time for anything interesting to happen, and there's barely anything good about this film. The film could have been great, instead it's a disappointment. Terrence Malick is a great director, unfortunately The Thin Red Line isn't really engaging, and you lose interest because the film is stuck in first gear and doesn't go anywhere. If you're looking for a great war film, The Thin Red Line isn't that film. Watch Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket instead. This is simply a boring film trying to be a great war film, and it misses the mark on so many levels.",

With any Malick film, it is visual poetry and asks a lot from the viewer. Each frame truly is worth a thousand words that you can pick apart with every view. The ensemble of cast members is extraordinary and the acting is very good itself. On a technical level, its absolutely beautiful to watch and will haunt viewers with its approach and views towards each situation. The devastation of nature is akin to man himself. Masterpiece.",

While Spielberg's film used state of the art visuals to create a horrific, realistic, and epic European battleground, Malick prefers a subtler and more poetic touch in his exploration of the Pacific theater, going more for characterizations than emotions. The film is full of some beautiful imagery, and cinematographer John Toll gives it a murky and surrealistic picture, far more indistinct the the massive scope of Saving Private Ryan. The battle scenes are also expertly staged, more about suspense and the fear of the men than the actual guns and explosions. Malick returns from a 20-year hiatus in filmmaking, but from his skillful direction, you'd think he hadn't skipped a day. Add to these merits the outstanding performances from its ensemble, and you've got one of the finest contemporary war films.",

Mais il s'agit egalement d'un film de Terrence Malick, ce qui signifie qu'il est impossible de le resumer Ã  ce qu'on en percoit en surface.  Ainsi, le positionnement historique ne sert aucune visee patriotique ou didactique, et meme le cheminement personnels des differents protagonistes, leurs doutes, leurs craintes et leurs actes, ne servent que de paravent a une reflexion globale qui confine parfois au mysticisme.  Durant pres de trois heures, la vision de corps mutiles voisinera avec celle d'indigenes vivant dans un paradis tropical perpetuel, tandis les affrontements bestiaux entre soldats ennemis serviront de contrepoints a de fugaces instantanes de la flore et de la faune soumises au cycle immuable de la vie.  Qu'est ce que Malick essaye de nous dire ? Que la vie est un Tout, que les actions humaines sont futiles d'un point de vue cosmique, que les reponses a ce \"Tout\", jamais directement exprime mais palpable, sont multiples ? Il serait de toute facon impossible de dresser une liste exhaustive des visees du film au terme d'une unique vision.  D'ailleurs, s'agit-il vraiment d'un film tel qu'on le concoit habituellement, quelque chose qui apporterait une explication, une revelation, un sens clair et precis ?  Avec sa voix off proposant au gre du hasard une multitude de points de vue sur une multitude d'interrogations sans lien evident avec l'image, ou avec ces soldats soudain pris de vertige philosophique, \"La ligne rouge\" ressemble plutot a  une ode, a un mantra qui ne servirait que d'instrument pour atteindre un etat meditatif propre a chacun.  Par sa reelle volonte de profondeur et sa transcendance, qui devrait menager de nouvelles pistes de reflexion a chaque seance, \"La ligne rouge\" est peut-etre un film essentiel.  Peut-etre, car sa lenteur contemplative le rend particulierement hermetique et, a moins de se laisser domestiquer par son style unique, il pourrait rapidement s'apparenter a un indigeste salmigondis de considerations metaphysiques.  En tout cas, ne vous avisez pas de le regarder simplement pour passer un agreable moment de cinema, pour reflechir et vous indigner a moindre cout...et encore moins pour vous taper un bon film de guerre !",

            "content": "After a twenty year hiatus from filmmaking, Terrence Malick released this meditative World War II drama about the pursuit by American soldiers to take a hill at Guadalcanal from the Japanese. Malick wrote and directed this adaptation of the James Jones novel. Like previous Malick pictures, this is a poetic reverie that lacks a straightforward narrative, which was off-putting to most audiences. Malick frequently places the camera at ground level and tracks the soldiers along the fields within very high blades of grass that dwarfs the men. The use of interior monologues as narration by various characters provides Malick a device to philosophically explore man's violent effect on nature and war. This contemplative drama is one of the best contemporary war movies. Haunting, heavily replicated score by James Horner. Exquisite cinematography by John Toll and production design by Jack Fisk. The stellar cast includes Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, James Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Elias Koteas, Jared Leto, Nick Nolte, John C. Reilly, Tim Blake Nelson, John Travolta, Miranda Otto.",

That doesn't stop this movie from being quite good. The movie is well directed and some scenes in this movie are some of the best war scenes I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Now, normally in order to feel sympathy for the characters they must be well represented and fleshed out, but since this is a war movie I already feel sympathy. War is a terrible thing and changes the lives of those involved, and I think this film shows that well.\r\n\r\nThe film could have certainly used a better narrative structure, but then I remember this is a Malick film and that's not going to happen. I guess that's part of the beauty, but at times the film felt like a bit of a mess. There were too many times where I was taken out of the film and wanted it to progress already. Everyone involved in this film does a great job and that helps this film a lot. Sean Penn does a terrific job as the 1st Sgt. I realize a lot of people don't like the voice over narration parts of the film, but they don't really bother me. I mean I'm not going to say I'm really moved by them, but some of them are quite interesting to hear.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be a Malick film without the breathtaking cinematography now would it? It's a great part of the film and makes it worth watching. There are so many beautiful shots that some were quite captivating. Also, the original score is great as well. It certainly adds to the film and Hans Zimmer has truly outdone himself yet again. He has the power to add tension to important scenes that might now work without the score in the background. Anyway, this film is certainly worth watching and up there with anything else Malick has done, but has I said there are too many parts where I felt I was taken out the film and it kind of spoiled it for me.",

Most war films focus on the battle or the effects of war on a soldier after he has returned home but \"Thin Red Line\" focuses on the effects on the soldier while he is still deployed.  As far as war films are concerned, I always rate fictional accounts below true stories but this film's prerogative is not to tell a specific war story; rather, it is more of a dramatic look at humanity.  One of the most impressive aspects of the film is the sound effects, which are constant and provide this film with its realism.  It also doesn't hurt that the well-establish group of actors (many of whom only appear onscreen for less than ten minutes) each interprets his character with a unique set of emotions.  Amidst the many stars, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin shine the brightest.  The most poignant scene of the film occurs about 2/3 of the way through, when the Americans invade the Japanese camp.  Hans Zimmer's slow, quiet string score begins almost silently as the soldiers creep through the fog, progressively growing in volume and tension (but not in tempo) as the fighting escalates.  It creates a duality of agression (through the imagery) and peacefulness (through the music).  The film does tend to drag at times, making making me question whether the 3-hour runtime is worth it, but I would watch it again just for the aforementioned scene.",

            "content": "The Thin Red Line was the first masterpiece that Terrence Malick had created, and to this day i wish I could discover what was going through this incredible directors head to make such a personal and incredible film.  The movie is mainly a war movie, but it is also a movie that tells many different stories about many different soldiers who's lives have been affected by war.  I found this to be a incredibly intense and realistic war movie, also i discovered it was released in 1997 so I'm guessing that must have been the year for great war films with this and Saving Private Ryan.\n\n  The story is based on the book  by James Jones and follows a large group of soldiers and their experiences with world War II.  But it mainly follows their mission to secure a hill held by the Japanese.  This battle was called the Battle of Mount Austen and this is a depiction of the soldiers experiences during the battle. \n\n  The plot is one of the greatest and most incredible plot lines to a war film I have ever seen.  Saving Private Ryan is my favorite war film of all time, but on terms of story I would say this is much greater in characterization and showing the true nature of a soldier.  Saving private Ryan was better in plot and realism, but that is not to say I did not think this film had a bad plot.  In fact it has a truly incredible storyline and was very realistic, but its true genius is in the characters and their different experiences they have and I just simply loved it.  There is something very special about this story, something deep they are trying to teach us about the nature of the human soldier, and I learned very much about them from this incredible masterpiece.\n\n  The cast is a huge list of incredible performances and their really is no main actor because they all have their equal screen time and each did a incredible job.  Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, James Caviezel, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney, John C. Reilly, John Cusack, Ben Chaplin, john Travolta, Nick Nolte, Tim Blake Nelson, and the rest of them were all incredible in my eyes and highly memorable.  It actually is a pretty special thing that I am able to remember each character with their being such a huge cast, and that shows true greatness. \n\n  The war scenes shown were incredibly realistic and made this one of my favorite war films of all time.  They do not use constant explosions to make this some weird Michael Bay war film that is cheesy and just their for cash.  Terrence Malick works hard to make this a realistic and as close a depiction to the Battle of Mount Austen as possible.  I simply loved the beauty and genius put into each scene.\n\n  The music is honestly one of the greatest scores of all time.  Almost this entire film has just incredible music to lead on this story and its incredible characters.  During the war scenes it felt as if I was watching a moving painting due to the art of the music and everything else, just simply beautiful.\n\n  The Thin Red Line is a film that is impossible to describe in a few words if you ask me.  If you asked me what its about I will tell have to go on for like 5 minutes to describe the beauty and how it differs from other war films.  This is not a movie just trying to give us a good time, its a movie trying to get a important point across to us.  I believe that the point is that being a soldier will change you, it will teach you respect, the value of life, and the nature of true war.  It is a magical film in a way, I just cannot explain the pure beauty in each scene, the genius in the characters, and incredible direction from a man who has shown us a war film that has never been done before.",

The thing about Malick that I noticed the most was his cinematography, and I'll note 2 things: 1, during a battle, if a soldier was running, many times the camera runs with them, usually right in front or behind them. Great choice, keeps the audience in the fray, and reminded me of Cuaron, cept Cuaron uses MUCH longer takes, which is more bad ass. 2, he shows us these breathtaking landscapes, scenery, and animals, and many of these things can be metaphors and imagery for what is taking place right before or after these shots. Cinematography that can really make you feel something, now that's powerful. Yet another cool thing bout this movie were the backstories, which were usually told through that character's voice-over narration ('nother little tidbit that I love!) Anyways, I've ranted enough on here. Go see this for 3 reasons: WWII story bout a battle that you prolly don't know; Malick's gift with a camera; and the stunning performance from Elias Koteas (yes, that guy who was Casey in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Thin Red Line is a rather more philosophical and poetic War film. The War to that extent that you'll start questioning about the cause of happenings of Wars? the film is represented as if there is no enemy on either side, but there are just soldiers and human beings. And there is one aspiring human being, who is thought of as extra=emotional and sentimental, and who has to pay the price for bringing a delicate heart in War. This is how Maliick presented Thin Red Line. The film raises many questions about the cause and happenings of War through it's poetic progressing narrative, and which will make you give a feeling that how would the world be if there were peace. But watching Mallick's films needs patience. And for most of the watchers, his films can be watched only one time, but his films believe in saying and giving something more  spiritual then sticking it to a dramatic entertainment.",

While it's true we are individuals, at the same time we are all one, so intricately connected in our experiences and sufferings. The Thin Red Line reminded me of that concept, and it made the film much more powerful. I didn't feel as much the first time I saw it. I missed it. It hit me this time. Malick's the bomb. \r\n\r\n\"One man looks at a dying bird and thinks there's nothing but unanswered pain. That death's got the final word, it's laughing at him. Another man sees that same bird, feels the glory, feels something smiling through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you righteous? Kind? Does your confidence lie in this? Are you loved by all? Know that I was, too. Do you imagine your sufferings will be less because you loved goodness? Truth?\" (Dead Japanese Soldier)\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to sleep at 9:30 last night, so I woke up around 5 AM this morning. At about 7 AM I decided to watch The Thin Red Line after seeing a trailer got me in the mood for it.",

            "content": "I saw this film some years ago and didn't like it too much back then. Now I decided to revisit it to see whether I was wrong and just didn't understand it or because it's a crappy movie.\r\n\r\nWhat struck me first was the mindblowing cinematography I somehow didn't notice the last time. It comes with one of the most realistic depictions of military life and strategy and a fantastic score by Hans Zimmer (and I don't place much value on classic piano/orchestra score usually, most of them are good if they're working in the subconscious but Zimmer somehow achieved to elevate all the incredible visuals to a new level with his music - I guess that's how film scores should be).\r\nAlthough I preferred the pictures of the untouched jungle and men crouching through grass Malick shows much of the cruelty of combat and he does it in a very honest way (but that's nothing new, others did that before and after - even better).\r\nMalick also gathered an intriguing cast that did a good job (especially Nolte and Koteas) despite the lack of dialogue in the film. The whole story is carried by various voice-over monologues by the different characters (which may not be everyone's taste).\r\nSpeaking of characters - the film simply has too many of them and it's quite confusing if they're looking so similar like some of the main actors do (I actually didn't notice that Cusack and Chaplin were two different people until over an hour). You can't genuinely care about or even remember all of them which is a pity if a film focuses on personal drama like The Thin Red Line does.\r\n\r\nWhat's more to say - it's preposterous like all of Malick's films - he always tries to put some philosophy and questions of meaning into his films when he better just should have done a great war epic. The cruelty of war and the whole psychology that goes with it is a big enough theme for a film - you don't need to project all these questions about life where they just not belong.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it's another point in favor of Tree of Life and it's getting more and more likely that I'll see it some time in the near future. The Thin Red Line is certainly not one of my favourite films, but it's better than Saving Private Ryan (to whom it's often compared) and has one of the greatest if not the very greatest cinematography in any war film (the 2001 of war films so to say).",

            "content": "I'll put it to you straight-- it's hard to like \"The Thin Red Line.\"  You have to be in the right state of mind, let your guard down, and quiet that little voice in your head that starts groaning at the first hint of pretentiousness.  \r\n\r\nTerrence Malick, the director, is a curious filmmaker.  He's been around for several decades and has a serious cult following, yet he has only made a small handful of films.  Here is the short list: Badlands, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line, The New World, and The Tree of Life.  \"Badlands,\" made in 1973, is understated and beautifully shot.  \"Days of Heaven\" has high critical marks, but I haven't yet seen it.  \"The New World\" is on my list of top fifty greatest films of all time.  And \"The Tree of Life,\" his latest, is getting rave reviews across the country; I'll be racing to theaters as soon as it comes within 30 miles of me.  \r\n\r\nSome say his problem is lack of clear plot.  Some say it's his slow pace.  Some say he's too focused on idle cinematography, that he overuses voiceover, that he wanders too much in the character's minds and leaves too much of the action out of the story.  Well \"The Thin Red Line\" probably falls victim to all of those accusations.  No reasonable person could refute that.  My beef I have with his critics, though, stems from the fact that character-based filmmaking seems to be losing its place in the mainstream.  It might have already, I'm not sure.  So I have to celebrate a man who ignores the pressure from big studios, or even from the paying public, to make a brain-dead, action-driven film like \"Thor,\" \"Avatar,\" or \"Iron Man 2.\"  \r\n\r\nSo Malick, in my opinion, is an artist.  A flawed artist, yes, but an artist, and there are so few of them left in Hollywood who can garner the star power of John Travolta, George Clooney, Adrien Brody, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack, John C. Reilly, and Woody Harrelson.  Yes, all of those men are in \"The Thin Red Line.\"  A bit much, you say?  Check out \"The Thin Red Line\" on Wikipedia.  Believe it or not, in the original 5 hour cut (the final version is almost 3 hours), actors like Mickey Rourke, Martin Sheen, and Billy Bob Thorton were also heavily involved.  \r\n\r\nThe film, as it stands, is indeed a bit too painfully over-narrated and slow-paced to be enjoyed by most.  There are tense, involving war scenes that are smartly filmed.  But the character voiceover is vague, redundant, uncompelling, and yes, slightly pretentious.  The idleness is, well, a drag.  I believe even the most patient and sophisticated viewers would tire during \"The Thin Red Line\" because we're all human; at the end of it, we all want to get down to some of the juicy bits.  There just aren't many juicy bits in this film.  The opportunity to characterize deeply is there, but as Roger Ebert has said about this movie, nobody gets enough screen time to really tell his story.  \r\n\r\nSee the film because of the excellent cinematography (John Toll), complementary horrifying music (Hans Zimmer), and some great acting from Sean Penn, John Cusack, John Travolta and others.  It's an experience.  Watch it on a big TV, loud, and get ready to settle in for awhile.  It feels every minute as long as it is.",

I watch this, and see how human beings, from different views of life, deal with the insanity that is war. Each and every one has a clear purpose or reason for being where they are. It's difficult to express, in truth, the feeling conveyed during and after this movie. The idea of connection and relation one can have between all people is stunning. Very moving are the moments Witt's narrations take over; as one seems to view enlightenment and \"beauty\" or \"understanding\" even so savage and pointless a thing as war. \n     Just as powerful is the scene where Cusack stands up to Nolte, refusing to commit his men to obvious slaughter. And though Nolte is easy to look upon as a certain antagonist, I still find cause to view his perspective and goals as another human being that could have those very same thoughts. Again, the enemy here is war itself, basic human nature seeming at odds with it in the form of the native tribespeople, whom appear from time to time. \n   The only weak point of the film is the 10-20 minutes before the final scene in the river. We see the counterattack (attack?) on Henderson airfield as a sort of pseudo-dream. While this fits in with the film, and keeps the dosage of philosophy to a more controllable bit, I do think a little bit more attention COULD have been brought to this. This is definitive nit-picking, and I see no reason to go through with it on the rest of the film.\n    A thinking movie, to be experienced, not merely \"watched.\"\n    Those who walk in and out not taking something more away have missed the point, and should consider movies of a lesser grade for regular viewing.

He blatently explores beneath the surface and delves into the minds of the soldiers, highlighting the horror, the terror and the ultimate fear of death that lies within. Like any war film, it's uneasy viewing but with Malick's rich vision, it's never too jarring to watch and in my opinion, it's more effective than the same year's glorified feast of war Saving Private Ryan.",

However, it is more about the war-like nature of \"civilized man.\" Malick starts by showing two soldiers AWOL on an island in the middle of the Pacific and interacting with the people of the island. Everyone is at peace. No one fights. \n\nAnd then they are caught and pretty much thrown into hell.\n\nThere are many small, memorable roles in this movie. Don't blink or else you will miss John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney, and John Cusack. Sean Penn is great as the bitter, battle weary sergeant who is but isn't Jim Caviezel's best friend. Speaking of which, Jim Caviezel's Private Witt is brilliant. Adrien Brody maybe says five words in the entire movie, but does so much with facial expression. You know what he is thinking. Elias Koteas is also great as the Captain who wants to keep his platoon together and in one piece. My favourite is Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall. He is bitter, driven and, at times, explosive.\n\nThe real beauty of this \"film\" is in its shots and dream sequences. Malick has a way of portraying landscape and dreams like no other director I know. And it takes a real talent to make these so vivid as Malick does.\n\nI realize this \"film\" may not be everyone.

            "content": "This is a weirdly difficult movie to talk about. On the one hand, it's clearly the work of a genuine artist. It's the first movie I've seen from Terrence Malick, and he's a true original. Many filmmakers, even great ones, usually have discernible influences from other filmmakers and genres, but not Malick. He seems to exist on a plane all his own. On the other hand, I don't think this movie entirely succeeds in what it's trying to do.\n\nIt's ostensibly the story of the battle of Guadalcanal in World War II, but it's not terribly concerned with the actual historical specifics of the battle. Instead, the movie seems more like an occasion for Terrence Malick to use the war for his mediation on the meaning of life. There's a very large cast of actors, most of whom are very famous, but only about four of them get to appear in more than a couple of scenes. Nick Nolte gets the best part as an aggressive colonel; Jim Caviezel seems detached and almost angelic as a private; Sean Penn is pretty good as a cynical sergeant; and Elias Koteas is good as a more sensitive sergeant who doesn't like risking his men's lives. Other famous actors - Adrien Brody, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, John C. Reilly - fade in and out of the movie without the chance to make much impression. \n\nThe film doesn't rigorously follow any strong storyline, but kind of drifts along in a dreamlike fashion. Its perspective seems detached from that of any particular character. We sometimes get voiceovers from the characters that supposedly reveal their inner thoughts, but they are abstract philosophical musings that don't actually make much sense in context. These soldiers can't really be wondering things like, \"Where does love come from? What is this evil inside of us?\" And the movie doesn't really explore these philosophical questions either, I don't think - it just poses them, and then moves on. I don't think the voiceover parts are adequately well-integrated into the fabric of the film.\n\nThat being said, Malick certainly is a strong director visually. John Toll's excellent cinematography helps. The film contains some of the most evocative shots of tall grass that I've ever seen, and there are some really impressively directed shots that move along hillsides and through the chaotic battles. There are beautiful nature shots too, of animals and trees and sunlight. The musical score by Hans Zimmer is absolutely indispensable to the film's effect, as well. Unlike Zimmer's more typical action-y movie scores, this one seems ethereal and spiritual, almost like devotional church music. It's one of the best scores he's written, and helps make the movie feel like it's taking place on some more elevated plane of existence. This movie is usually compared to Saving Private Ryan, which came out in the same year. Overall, the films are trying different things, but I do think Saving Private Ryan is the more ultimately successful and powerful movie. Still, although this film doesn't 100% work, it's a worthwhile and unique experience.",

It's a poetic, morose, honest, soul shattering work that shows in great gorgeous visual scenes of the nature, humans, culture, and the world America has no problem obliterating. The way Malick depicts what war does to man is untouched and done in such a way that we feel trapped in their inner crisis. The all-star cast delivers lines with such powerful intensity it intoxicates you in ways you didn't know existed. \nAt three-hours-long 'The Thin Red Line' accomplishes an entire world and its emotions and struggles into a perfectly photographed work of maudlin juxtapositions and pure honesty. This is a film that is better than anything Kubrick, DePalma, Spielberg, et al could even imagine making.

For me, the reason it was so great (besides the perfect craftsmanship of shooting and editing) was the perspective of the story. The film didn't show the glory of war, and didn't outright condemn war, it showed you exactly what the soldiers felt and lets you decide for yourself. The film seems to be objective and subjective at the same time, thereby making what Bill Hader said about it having \"the perspective of God\" sound quite accurate.

            "content": "After a 20 year absence, writer director Terrence Malick made a triumphant return with a film that is an evolution of the style we saw in his first two films, Badlands and Days of Heaven. Where these two films were specific stories told in a surreal and subjective way, this movie is a much more of a meditation of war, with no real climax, just a series of interconnecting events.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the story shifts across a series of characters, but starts and finishes with Private Witt, played in an understated, subtle and totally captivating way by James Caviezel. There are also good performances from various characters that move in and out of the story, the most notable being yet more impressively understated performances by Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas. Other characters come and go, with a Nick Nolte offering a more visceral, aggressive but still absorbing performance as Major Tall. Other characters have nothing more than extended cameos, coming and going briefly, the most obvious ones being John Cusack, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, Adrian Brody(who doesn't utter a word of dialogue in the movie!) and George Clooney. It is impressive to see Malick working with these actors to keep their performances very grounded and subtle, but totally absorbing. This is mainly due to Malick's supreme skills as a visual storyteller, and it is clear that he has lost none of his skill despite this 20 year break. He composes scenes with long duration shots that involve a lot of improvisation, and he requires his actors to tell a lot of the story with expressions, using significant amounts of voice-over that is clearly added later and also improvised. The telling of this very emotionally and psychologically involving story is hugely assisted by some tremendous technical contributions. John Toll's photography, Jack Fisk's production design and Hans Zimmer's score (which seems to have been composed as a series of suites rather that to specific cues in the action) all have huge positive impacts on the film, and take the experience of watching it to another level. While the film deals with war, Malick's approach to the violence is tactful and diplomatic, but still visceral. While the film has long stretches of characters mediating, philosophising and reflecting on their experiences these sequences never drag and the action sequences, when they come, are brilliantly directed, technically amazing, and hugely involving emotionally, making you feel what the characters are going through, rather than a more detached view of 'that was a big explosion!'. There is some tremendous crane and Steadicam work ( the latter by Brad Shield), and it shows that Malick is one of those few directors who understand how to use these camera processes in a way that integrates it into the storytelling, rather than as a problem solving tool to shoot certain sequences, or to show off to the audience. The only other director who uses these approaches this effectively was the late Stanley Kubrick.\r\n\r\nThere are some interesting inferences made in the film. There seems to be this subtext of the spirituality of life, as shown by the capacity of the wonderfully created natural environment to create harmony and peace, the more caring characters' appreciation of the natural environment, and the care of that some of the characters have for each other, including Captain Staros(played by Elias Koteas), and most notably the Private Witt character, who undergoes a transcendental experience through the story - there seems to a spiritual parallel here; and the questioning of the reason for this nonsensical violence by the some of the characters. Fascinatingly this is contrasted with the more brutal aspects of nature such as the fact that humankind is instigating violence on its own species. The selfish, personal motivations of Lt Colonel Tall's determination to achieve (who is driving the instigation of the violence, and points out his prospective brutal interpretation of nature during the film), the selfish barbarism of some of the US soldiers on their Japanese prisoners, and the individualistic motivation of the Mirando Otto's character towards her husband, played by Ben Chaplin, while he is bravely battling at the front. These 'Ying' and 'Yang' elements in the story seem to balance out very well, but even the characters who survive this story, all have scars to bear at the end. The only character who reaches inner peace and enlightenment is Witt, who of course despite his bravery and calm in the face of battle is essentially a compassionate pacifist. \r\n\r\nThese subtexts, as well as the tremendous polished nature of the filmmaking, means that providing you are patient, you will have a terrific experience watching this film. Furthermore you will still be thinking about the themes raised in this film long after you have finished watching it.\r\n\r\nOverall, a wonderful experience from a genius of a filmmaker.",

            "content": "8.9/10\r\n\r\n                  The last time I saw a Terrence Malick film was when I watched \"Days of Heaven\". I swore I would see more of his work, and as you can see, I haven't been so faithful to that promise. So here I am reviewing Malick's third film, \"The Thin Red Line\", which sees the legendary artistic mastermind tackling a genre I always imagined he would tackle; the war genre. Malick is good at flawlessly directing his films, adding beautiful cinematography to intensify mood and emotions. He's a story-teller, a philosopher, and a true artist. He's made yet another great movie with his third outing.\r\n\r\n     What I love about films is their ability to depict something that video games, novels, or anything else, for the matter, can possibly show. The intense, brutal, and emotional side of war has lost meaning to most of America due to those silly \"Call of Duty\" games, but you can do so much more with the concept of war when you're making a film. You can either make it look fun, or you can punch the audience in the face with emotions. Your call. But a film has the right to be entertaining and painful, doesn't it? Just like \"Platoon\" and several other great films before it, \"The Thin Red Line\" does not embrace or promote war; it makes it look like shit. And it's as sad as ever to witness unfold.\r\n\r\n        The film takes place during the battle of Guadalcanal, which took place during World War II. A lot of the film focuses on the soldiers in \"C Company\", although it focuses on just about everyone else as well. As with all war films, the actual combat scenes take up most of the film, which isn't a problem given how fascinating they are. Malick tells his story with both complexity and affection for the emotions of his soldier characters. I liked the characters because they each had personalities, histories, and reasons why they were fighting. You just can't have a good war film without those ingredients.\r\n\r\n     The film's central themes are typical-war-film-fare themes; bloodlust, violence, and loss of humanity. The film's message is this: After a war, there's no returning to your life. This theme has been re-used, but there's a certain beauty to \"The Thin Red Line\" that makes all the horrors and sorrow of these days in war both fascinating, cruel, and powerful.\r\n\r\n         Terrence Malick knows how to make a movie. He's a born filmmaker who prefers cinematography over anything else; yet his films tell powerful and emotionally resonant tales. He really is just a great filmmaker, and \"The Thin Red Line\" is another absorbing work. It's a war epic, thus it is long, but never overlong. Two hours of footage was cut, which cuts out many actors, as it would appear, but I can't complain. After all, war is longer than three hours. Malick is merely treating us with essential decency.\r\n       \r\n          The war images shown in the film are haunting and unforgettable; sometimes even frightening. But after all, they should be; it is war. War is violent, messy, sad, and full of loss. This film shows it all; without graphic amounts of violence, but with some genuinely emotional understanding none the less. I also admired how Malick showed the environment around these soliders; imagery that ranges from the animals to the vegetation, all the way to the little noises that inhabit the air. I liked \"The Thin Red Line\" for the skill and power that went into it. I loved it for different reasons, some I shall not say, for they may just spoil the film for you. And given how good it is, I wouldn't want to do that.\r\n\r\n        The reason I have not mentioned such things as \"performance\" and \"music\" is because (1.) there are so many actors to the point where singling a few out would be unfair, and (2.) the music is great, I just forgot to mention it. What takes center stage here is, as I said, the direction of Malick. This was the first film in twenty years from Terrence Malick, when it initially released, and if one can make a come-back as good as this, one must be a cinematic god. Perhaps Malick will someday be known as a historical man. To me, he already is influential. Nobody can be quite like him, nobody can imitate him, and nobody can make films like he does. \"The Thin Red Line\" is a great cinematic experience; beautifully shot, powerful, and well-made all around. For those reasons, I am recommending it ever-so-highly.",

Yet the goal of the film is not to reenact the battle to the degree of precision which we saw that same year of 1998 in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and his D-day account. No, this is a very different depiction of war indeed. Yes, there is blood and there is something of a body count by the end, but this is just as much, if not more a film about the soul and nature of man, than the often times over emphasized spectacle of war.One of the many key themes of the film is natures war within itself. Throughout the picture we are bombarded with images of the beauty of the natural world which acts almost as a character within the story itself, waiting like a snare to eat the young soldiers up like a lion devours its prey. \nThis, of course, is a highly existentialist concept which is being portrayed. It is the first war film I've ever seen which takes a good 46 minutes before the first shot is ever fired. This is because it is not one of the many guts-and-glory Rambo films which we are so keenly aware. It is not about the kill, but more of what the kill actually means. \nA ways into the film, a young soldier crouches in the brush, looking down the long barrel of his rifle up to the crest of a hill which is closely guarded by Japanese soldiers. After spotting a group of two or three carrying a piece of equipment across it's grassy face, he opens fire, dispensing with three or four bullets in order to pick off the one. His aim is dodgy but his spirit is relentless. The soldier falls to the ground, presumably dead. At this point we enter into the soldiers mind: \"I killed a man. Worse thing you can do. Worse than rape. I killed a man, nobody can touch me for it.\" \nThis is a constant theme which we are reminded of throughout the picture: what does war do to the soul of a man. At some point this beautiful world around us must have gone wrong, somehow. Is this the directors argument for original sin? Perhaps. All that I am aware of is that there is something disjointed in this world which is presented to us. Are these Japanese really the enemy? Or are they men, just like the American's and Allied Forces who have been placed in the middle of a situation which they would rather not be in -- afraid; alone; clinging onto the last tender bits of the conflicted hope that they have. Where does war come from? Who invented the killing of another human being? Who takes pleasure in it enough that they would game of such dire word consequence?\nThis movie gives us no answers. It is not our war, but a war which we watch as does the disembodied camera which floats here and there, passing like a wind over the brush. It is as if G-d is looking down upon this destruction and asking himself, \"Where did things go wrong with this beautiful creation?\" \nYet by its end, I found the film very life affirming. With constant speech concerning the nature of life, and good, and evil, and life after life, I could not help but feel slightly elevated. This film does not preach, it contemplates. It is not a war film, but a meditation on life and the chaos which is produced therein. This is a film which has the courage to be what it wants to be and does not have the need to please an audience, but take the time to challenge the audience. This is a very, very good movie indeed.",

            "content": "The film was probably 50 minutes too long. It should have ended after taking that first bunker. This may be my only criticism of the film. First of all, the cast is brilliant. But more than that, Terrence Malick's treatment of the cast makes it even more brilliant. Adrian Brody has maybe 5 lines in the film. Jared Leto is shot down with no remorse. George Clooney shows up in the last 15 minutes. Who cares who these stars are? This is war. People die in war. You lose friends in war but you have to move on. There are no 5 minute periods of someone bleeding out as we look down upon him with sympathy. The goal is to defeat the Japanese, to take a bunker, and win the battle. While doing this, it is okay to take a look around at the beauty that war is destroying. This is what makes Malick's style perfect for this film. Malick always uses nature metaphorically. In this film nature's beauty is a juxtaposition with the monstrosity of war. When you watch a Malick film, you know every shot will be meticulously composed, beautifully shot, and wonderfully framed. The cinematography in this film is nothing short of spectacular. Malick is able to find the most aesthetically stunning shots of nature and, in this film, stunning shots of carnage. The camera acts a soldier itself, crawling through the high flowing grass, as explosions and gun fire never cease. There are long take tracking shots from behind soldiers as they begin to take the bunker at the top of the hill while seeing Japanese men with painful expressions on their faces. Adding to that, the score of the film is incredibly epic and completely fitting for the epicness of the camera work. We may not get to know each and every soldier, but that doesn't detract from the emotions that each shot invokes. This is a war film not to be reckoned with. The shutter speed is not increased and the camera is not flailing around. We can take in the carnage of war and see the surrounding beauty just as Malick intends and acts as a wonderful variation on the typical blockbuster war film.",

Pay attention to Nolte's subtle acting in the outpost scene).  Probably one of the best parts of the movie is how it takes stereotypical characters and injects so much humanity in each of them.  Each character's dialogue can be elaborated to the point of thesis papers.  That is how strong the script's writing is.

Maybe it all comes back to that critic nostalgia thing, because by the time you finish the film, you'll feel as though fifty years have passed, which is just long enough for this film to be considered a masterpiece, and I suppose it is, though only as a masterpiece of insomnia cures. I suppose that makes this film one of those medications with potentially fatal side effects, because if being bored to death is possible, then you might want to proceed with caution when watching this film, because if you pass out, when you come to, I can't gurantee that it will be red, but the last thing that you'll ever see might very well be a thin line on a monitor. No, but seriously though, this film is still actually pretty good, which is more than I can say about Terrence Malick's preceding effort (He did this film twenty years later; maybe \"Days of Heaven\" put even him in a coma), and I think that a huge reason why is because this film has a lot more celebrities, and more stars make everything better. Eh, maybe not, because the final cut of this film lost Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Sheen, Gary Oldman, Bill Pullman, Lukas Haas, Jason Patric, Viggo Mortensen and Mickey Rourke, because even Malick must have felt that the film was getting to be too long and slow to be saved by as many celebrities as he had. Well, in all fairness, the original cut reportedly ran for about five hours, and no amount of talented celebrities would have saved five hours of a film like this. Well, maybe it still would have been good, largely because I'm of the opinion that five hours of a film like this better be good, but also because the star-studded cast isn't this film's only high point, yet no matter how high this film hits at points, potential still goes squnadered by the simple fact that this film is just blased boring, which isn't to say that slowness is this film's only flaw, because if you thought that war dramas were preachy enough, then brother, just wait until you see Terrence Malick hop on board.\r\n\r\nTerrence Malick has always been an overbearingly meditative filmmaker who draws much too much lyricism from the subject matter that he works with, to the point of really overwhelming things, and with this film taking on a message as heavy-handed and, of course, done-to-death as \"War is Horrible\", it should practically go without saying that Malick gets really carried away with this film's themes, while what is worth mentioning - being that it's not that common of an occurrence - is the fact that Malick breaks his rule of having not much more than one central theme, which is an action that's partially worth mentioning because Malick doesn't break that rule with a lot of ease. The film is particularly emphatic in its focus on such themes as spirituality, environment, humanity and fellowship, and when you toss all of that on top of the aforementioned central theme of \"War is Horrible\", you're left with a lot of thematic material that really could have worked, yet where Malick first slips up is in his tackling of too many themes, and messily so, to where, after a while, things become thematically uneven, with one of the only consistencies between almost all of the themes being overbearingness, as Malick really lays things on thick with his coating the film in relentless thematic meditativeness, to the point of not only creating some pretty severe cheesiness - made all the worse by a couple of moments of pretty improvable dialogue - and unsubtlety out of too much subtlety, but also to the point of drowning out the story - such as it is - behind the themes, thus leaving some of the film's messages to ring false here and there. Sure, you can say that about any Terrence Malick film, yet it's especially problematic here, as the story concept doesn't entirely warrant extremely meditative lyricism, something further made clear by the long periods in which Malick really does decide to shut up with his blasted preaching and actually tell a story, though not particularly well, as his tonal jumps between meditative and traditional storytelling are almost as messy as his jumps between character focus, and I'm a little bit surprised to say that, becase as much as all of the many \"story\" arcs fall into many of the same tropes, you'd think that there would be some evening consistency in the sub\"plots\", and yet, there's not, just a lot of \"story\" repetition. Whether it be because he was out of commission for two decades by the time this film came out or simply because he just doesn't know how to tell a story, Malick makes quite a few glaring mistakes in his overbearing meditativeness, yet that doesn't stop him from tainting this film with his usual pretentious arrogance that may not be terribly overbearing, yet still gets on your never after a while. Still, with all of this messy \"story\"telling and overbearing meditativeness, it all leads back to the main issue, which is the simple fact that film is [b][u]\"just so doggone slow\"[/u][/b], which is another thing that you can say about every Terrence Malick film, yet what makes it especially problematic here isn't so much because Malick is unraveling this film particularly steadily or because such slowness doesn't gel well with this \"story\" concept, but because, well, the film is almost [b][u]\"three hours long\"[/u][/b], and forcibly so, going padded out to no end by redundant, repetitious material that slows everything to a crawl, while the intense dryness of everything finally brings this film down to an overwhelmingly boring - nay - just plain tedious state, and if I'm not selling you on that enough, then pull a chair up kids, because it's story time. I've seen this film before, as my introduction to Terrence Malick, so I first went in not knowing what to expect and was admittedly pretty tired (Uh oh), and sure, I powered through to the end of this film, yet may I be struck down if I wasn't actually vividly hallucinating from exhaustion by the end, as the film really does get that excessively dry and boring, and while I have revisited this film fully awake and fully aware of what to expect from Malick, I still always find myself disappointed with how this film squanders such high potential for the sake of a, well, tedious unconventional style that just doesn't work. However, with all of my complaints - of which, there are countless -, this film's potential would not be as illuminated as it is were it not for the fact that it still boasts many strengths that may certainly belong in a better film, yet still give Malick's vision so much juice, to the point of drowning out the film's faultiness just enough for the final product to somewhat engage, if not somewhat reward by its own right, and certainly deliver more than any preceding Malick film, even as far as style is concerned.\r\n\r\nI could never really dislike Terrence Malick, because although the man just can't keep potential or, well, anything together when it comes to telling a worthy story, he is quite undeniably a master artist (Lord knows that fact kept \"Days of Heaven\" from being total garbage), and while many of the obnoxiously overly nostalgiac critis hate to admit it, stylistic sensibilities have advanced considerably since Malick's disappearance in the '70s, and what we were left with by the late '90s, alone, was a filmmaking world with stylistic sensibilities more befitting to Malick's taste, so sure enough, with the help of cinematographer John Toll, Malick makes this film, if nothing else, visually stunning, with lighting and color being constantly played with over incredible imagery to create a relentless barrage of breathtaking visual artistry, which isn't to say that Malick doesn't also make this film audibly beautiful, as strange as that sounds. Malick knows how to paint a pretty motion picture, and there's no denying that this film's cinematography and art direction really do take your breath away, yet what almost calls your attention away from the visual artistry of the film is its musical artistry, for Malick has a great taste in music and really does get some great orchestral pieces for this film's soundtrack, while going as far as to bring the best music man in the movie business in to compose the original tunes this time around. Hans Zimmer might very well be my standalone favorite film score composer, so it should go without saying that this film really does deliver on the musical good will extremely high quality, for although the score is often very soberingly meditative and used to heavily exacerbated the film's slowness, it's still such a hauntingly poignant composition, with awe-inspiringly inspired grandness and emotional resonance that, when played, often keeps the film reasonably engaging and sometimes leaves the film to cut core-deep. The film is not at all the general masterpiece that the obnoxiously snooty praise it to be, yet it is, like all modern Terrence Malick films, a masterpiece of style, so much so that the style will sometimes bleed over into being viscerally gripping, as well as aesthetically, with another aspects that earns enough of your investment being, of course, the acting. The cast is bloated to the ends of the earth with stars, perhaps to an exhausting degree and certainly to an uneveningly messy degree, yet it's hard to mind this film's cast bloating too much, as most every star hits the scene reminding of us of how he got the notoriety, as most everyone is charismatic and inspired, with a distinctive presence and strong emotional range - which goes from broad, intense emoting or a subtle, thoughtful atmosphere - that keeps you locked into the film when material arises and summons some powerful shining moments of standout acting from such talents as Jim Caviezel, Adrien Brody, (There are a lot of stars, so get comfy), Nick Nolte, John Cusack, Elias Koteas, John Travolta (He's on for, like, one scene, and doesn't have anything to do, but come on, it's Travolta, so of course he's charming), Kirk Acevedo, the great Sean Penn, the great Woody Harrelson, the great Jared Leto and, of course, the underappreciated John C. Reilly (Wow, there are a lot of Johns attached to this film). Hold on, let me catch my breath, because there are so many mentionable names that I'm winded just from \"typing\" them out, so one can imagine what the five-hour-long extended cut's cast list would do to me (I'd rather not find out, because as much as I like watching cool long stuff, they can keep that cut). There's plenty about this film that raises standards for Terrence Malick, yet the man who really does do the most in leaving this film to stand as, not just enjoyable, but genuinely good - even with its flaws and overall potential squandering - is, well, Terrence Malick himself, believe it or not.\r\n\r\nCertainly, direction and storytelling go hand-in-hand, yet directing and storytelling can almost easily rest on two entirely different levels, as made clear by good Terrence Malick films such as these, because where Malick is an overambitious and immensely faulty storyteller, he is a good director who may have - woah boy - a lot of flaws, yet will hit potent points in his direction where he really does leave the film to ring true. Both the aestheic value of the film is often used to further exacerbate the limpness in Malick's extremely dry storytelling, yet there are still quite a few points where Malick does manipulate the level of quality in the artistry to actually breathe life and effectiveness into this film, which isn't to say that the technical value isn't surprisingly manipulated in the same way for the same remarkable, when not, well, detrimental results. The sound design, in particular, is very broad, being used by Malick to absorb the environment and atmosphere in order to really pronounce white noise that further lulls you out amidst all of this dry tedium, yet the fact of the matter is that the sound design really does capture the depths of this world, and while you'll be left hearing more than you want to, the detail in the film's sound design really does leave this world to spring to life and pull you in at points, particularly when we get to the action. The war sequences are truly impressive, not only in their being well-concieved, well-edited and well-shot, but also in their being well-manipulated by Malick, who marries with the aesthetic and technical sides of the film together through a visceral center that plants you in this world and creates actually pretty intense moments of action, with a sharp touch of style and substance that really does keep you engaged for a golden moment. However, the golden moments in which Malick finally wakes up and delivers on undeniably genuine resonance doesn't simply end with the moments of tension, for although this film gets to be an emotional mess, with heavy-handedness, occasional unsubtlety and even some overbearing arrogance, when Malick does strike an emotional note, it rings pretty deeply, especially when it comes to the final act. The film is an absolute mess with some high points, some low points and a whole lot of points where it's respectable enough to get by as a good watch, but the final act truly is a thing of brilliance, for although this film's final moments remain plagued by the flaws that haunted the rest of the film, they're still backed with immense inspiration by Malick, so much so that everything begins to fall into place with relative comfort and thoughtful subtlety with no real arrogance or forcefulness, but instead real genuineness that wraps this film up smoothly and creates a buzzing emotional surge that pierces deep, and by the time the film cues up Zimmer's \"God U Tekem Laef Blong Mi\", one of his greatest compositions ever, just in time for the credits, I truly did find myself almost in tears, yet part of the reason why was because I couldn't help but think about how moments such as those deserved to be in a much better film. It was Janet Maslin of the \"New York Times\" who really summed things up when she said that the \"heart-piercing moments that punctuate [the film's] rambling are glimpses of what a tighter film might have been\", because as good as this film is, it stands to be great, and were it not so wrapped up in its tediously overbearing and pretentious artistry and overambition, make no mistake, it really would have been a general masterpiece that could very well have topped a certain other WWII dramatic epic from 1998, yet as things stand, the poignant moments are just a few of the fair deal of undeniable glowing bright spots in this film that can keep you going through thick and thin if you're willing to go with the flow, and no matter how much the film wastes potential, it ultimately rewards as a generally worthwhile experience, vastly improvable though, it may be.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the line, the film gets to be messily overbearing and even rather uneven in its themes, with a story - such as it is - that is just as messy in focus, yet that doesn't stop Terrence Malick from drenching this film in a kind of shameless arrogance, though not as much as he drenches the film in dreadfully intense dryness that, when married with the excessive padding, nothingness and overall overbearing lyricism, creates an experience that is all too often incredibly dull, overlong and altogether, well, just plain tedious, thus leaving the final product to emerge having wasted high potential, yet still not to where it collapses as a total disaster of an overambitious misfire, as the film still strikes with stunning art direction and John Toll's phenomenal photography direction, as well as with mostly cleverly manipulated technical value and a riveting score by Hans Zimmer, thus giving the film a level of aesthetic quality so intense that it becomes emotionally impacting, with the help of a slew of charismatic and emotionally inspired performances within our immensely star-studded cast, and with the guidance of an incredibly flawed, yet sometimes effectively inspired Terrence Malick, whose artistic vision, complimented by the occasional piece of incontrovertibly penetrating emotional resonance, helps in making \"The Thin Red Line\" an aesthetic marvel, strong acting piece and ultimately rather viscerally rewarding effort, even if it does make for a difficult sit that stands - nay - deserves to reach much higher than it does.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Not much happens at all for the first hour, then there is a prolonged 'battle' sequence that was really only interesting for the lack of action that preceded it. The final hour then just meanders around randomly with no real direction or purpose. You know you are disengaged from a film when you start playing 'spot the actor' and this is really the ideal film to get you playing that game because literally, right up until the last minute, big name actors are appearing on screen for as little as 20 seconds. Nick nolte's performance is the stand out, as he was the only character in the film that provoked an emotional reaction from me. Also, it was pretty epic seeing a hundred guys on a massive ship in the sea for real- as nowadays that sort of scene im sure would gave been shot on greenscreen.It was very heavy handed for the most part, for example, during the battle scene there is an extended shot of a newborn bird struggling out of it's shell. Here pass me a hammer and I'll beat myself over the head with that metaphor.It's 3 hours long and all I could think was I'd rather have watched three episodes of 'the pacific' instead, particularly the arc set in gaudelcanal where this film takes place, as it was much more interesting, exciting and emotional.",

Theres a great cast of actors in this film which pop in now and then.

Demasiados personajes, tantos como perfÃ­les tiene un hecho tan trascendental como es la guerra. A veces pueden confundirnos tantos personajes pero son necesarios. MagnÃ­ficos Caviezel y Penn. El primero como el soldado idealista, pacifista y precursor del medio ambiente frente al segundo, un veterano soldado antiheroe con ciertas dosis de escepticismo que quiere terminar su trabajo. Es una pelÃ­cula lenta, llena de matices. Esa lentitud necesaria para un desarrollo intimista, que es su mayor valor, es a su vez su mayor enemigo. No pudo con el ritmo comercial de la cinta de Spielberg. Maravillosa fotografÃ­a de John Toll y no menos maravillosa banda sonora de Hans Zimmer. Portentosa..........Impressive fresh coral the one that offers us the third movie of the singular director Terrence Malik (\" The thin red line \"). Released months before that \" Save private Ryan \" from Spielberg, the two report warlike facts happened in 2 Âª world war but while the tape of Spielberg ensalza the heroism of giving the life to save others, in the Malik one makes notice the uselessness of the fact and the absurd of the war. Too many prominent figures, so many people since perfÃ­les has a fact as transcendental as it is the war. Sometimes so many prominent figures can confuse us but they are necessary. Magnificent Caviezel and Penn. The first one like the idealistic soldier, pacifist and predecessor of the environment opposite to the second one, a veteran soldier antihero with certain doses of skepticism that wants to end his work. It is a slow movie, full of shades. This slowness necessary for a development intimist one, who is his major value, is in turn his major enemy. It could not with the commercial pace of Spielberg's tape. John Toll's wonderful photography and not less wonderful sonorous band of Hans Zimmer. Marvellous.",

Strangely, it also succeeds at being extremely poetic, more so than being philosophical, as the camera moves through the material and listens to these characters.

Nick Notle does an amazing job mostly because he is the only one that got to really have a moment to act.

This isn't an anti-war film in the vein of Stone's Platoon, or a Spielbergesque celebration of the men who epitomized Brokaw's \"The Greatest Generation.\"\nIt is a reflection on the role of violence in a world replete with beauty. Malick's film doesn't assign blame. For him evil is perception, evil is amorphous, evil just is. He does not exploit the glory some men find in war. He shows that war is not a place where men are made. But rather war is a place where valor wears thin and medals are merely consolation prizes. \nI apologize if I am being too verbose, but this film defies a brief explanation and I am only scratching the surface of all that this film has to offer.\nMalick brilliantly wavers between the macabre and the serene. His camera sweeps in and out of battle scenes which really captures the intensity of the war. It also stops to take a look around. Drinking in the breathtaking landscapes that the war will soon ravage. It also uses Malick's signature voice over narration to great effect especially in the scene when the Americans invade a Japanese village. \nThe film is accompanied by an amazing score by Hans Zimmer. Zimmer's score isn't overly ornate.  It serves to build the already growing tension and is eerily absorbing. While I could sit here and extol all of the virtues of this film, it is something that needs to be experienced because it will leave an indelible mark on the viewer's mind.",

Now this was my first exposure to Terrence Malick, so it was hard to see past the endless voice-overs and overload of ensemble characters. Now I still say that I have problems with those two elements, but even with that, this is one of the most unique war films out there. It focuses more on the futility of the war, rather than tagging along with one central character and fitting in a giant arch of character development. We see characters enter and leave this movie at almost an alarming speed. This reinforces the concept of how many people, not just nameless men, lost their lives. It also manages to be more of what we would traditionally see as a Vietnam war movie rather than a WWII movie. It couldn't be more different from its contemporaries in both style and format. As with all of Malick's projects, this is beautiful beyond belief. After a while the grass became a character rather than just a backdrop. What really makes this movie great for me in terms of acting is Sean Penn. He maybe has around forty minutes of screen time maximum, but manages to be one of the most complex and captivating characters that the genre has to offer. Now I'm probably one of the select few who doesn't ogle over Jim Caviezel's performance as Witt, but the character was just too one dimensional for me. In many ways it is the most accurately structured war movie ever done because there is no real beginning or ending, we just get a selection of this period of fighting. Now The Thin Red Line is still not my favorite war movie, but it happens to be a whole lot closer now.",

            "content": "Welcome to the Thin Red Line. A war film that's love-it-or-leave-it, that's all it is. But which side do I take?\nIn this second paragraph, I usually write about the film's storyline. But, oddly, there isn't any story. Just basically a series of images and events, but isn't that what motion pictures are? You do see Army soldiers fighting in the Pacific on Guadalcanal Island during WWII though, and look into the lives of some of those soldiers.\nThere are many great qualities in this film that would assure its prestige. This has the tendency to ooze out \"visual poetry\", creating rich, vibrant, and even haunting images of the Pacific. The ensemble cast, with the majority being good actors, is an ideal one with unknowns and mainstream stars, newcomers and veterans alike. Many of the actors (Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte) did such a great job. None of its battle scenes can pack as much of a punch as the opening Normandy battle in \"Saving Private Ryan\", but all of them are gut-wrenching and terrific. Not only is this emotional, but also thought-provoking (this is an anti-war film, after all). Terence Malick must've had a brilliant vision to even come up with this film in the first place, and if it took him 20 years to do so, then that just goes to show the hard work put into it.\nBut for all the reasons that I could enjoy it, there are just as many reasons for me to hate it. The film feels rushed, disjointed, incomplete; and the production is unorganized, because some of the actors look lost and aloof. Well, that's because some of the actors in this \"all-star\" cast have their roles minimized (George Clooney, Woody Harrelson) or are miscast (John Travolta, with HIS GAY MUSTACHE not fitting his face or voice at all). Many scenes either go by too quickly, or just drag. A few scenes are hammy (Woody's death, for example: death by grenade prank) and don't mesh with the seriousness of it all. Also, I am baffled by its lack of a plot. That goes hand-in-hand with the issue of the actors and the filmmakers having no clear idea of what to do. And this movie fails to tell me what is going on, and the events that happen seem random. Given more time, this movie would've been able to have a more consistent tone, pace, and balance, which would've shot my rating up a bit. Also, even at nearly 3 hours, the film is too long, despite it being cut from an early draft, which is twice as lengthy.\nSo love it or hate it? This is a movie where you can't quite run down the middle so easily. It has divided even serious moviegoers and critics, and that's one reason you should see it for yourself so you could determine if it's any good. My opinion is that, yes, I like it. It is a good, maybe great, movie, but it's nowhere near as good as Saving Private Ryan. But The Thin Red Line is a transcendent and more advanced one. Round 2, which will stand the test of time???",

I was hypnotized by the beautiful images and innovative cinematography for nearly an hour of the three-hour running time, but then started wanting more substance than pretty pictures. And it took far less than an hour before I tired of the \"poetic\", often downright corny narration. Malick approaches ambitious questions about the violence in nature and humanity, but ends up saying almost nothing new or interesting.  The biggest sin this movie commits is casting so many great actors, and then doing nearly nothing with them. There are a few moments where the enormous talent of the cast shines through, but Malick seems uninterested in their characters. I appreciate the effort to do something radically different for the war genre, but The Thin Red Line was a depressingly empty experience for me - not to mention an excruciatingly long sit.",

Due to its release the same year as Saving Private Ryan back in 1998, it will forever be linked to Spielberg's anti-war opus. Yet, this movie deserves to be compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, due to it's style and distance from the audience. The film's only character is the Charlie Company and the conflict is between humankind itself. Director Terrance Malick asks profound questions and unlike \"Ryan,\" doesn't expect them to be answered because they simply can't be answered. Like 2001, the viewer is left with more questions than answers at the end of the film and is told in stunning visual fashion. Some critics have pointed out various flaws in the film; however, these traits are what sets the movie apart from it's peers. The stars like John Travolta and George Clooney have little screen time. They are the officers who command attention and are larger than life to the simple GI's who do the real work. The characters are mostly unrecognizable and you know little about them save the main characters like Pvt. Bell. But, the faces are meant to be unrecognizable; to paraphrase the film they are simply flesh and meat made from the earth simply to return back to it. Those who criticize the lack of violence in some scenes while labeling the other scenes intense don't realize the intensity the fight scenes generalize are due to the fact that the soldiers don't know when their next battle will be and when their last breath will take place. The main character, Charlie Company, is fighting to stay alive, the only real driving force of the plot. All of the characters have different views of the war, shown through the use of random spoken narrative. There is no easy conclusion to the war and the film starts off where it began, among the animals of the pacific. Life is one huge circle and one could guess the battle for the bunker on top of the hill could be fought again and there is no possible way to stop it. For me, the most haunting image was the scene when the Americans stare at their Japanese enemy after capturing the hill. Both sides seem to realize that they could be on the other side of the battle and that in war there really is no good vs. bad scenario, just what nation you're from and who you are trying to kill. Yet the question asked is why war occurs and why we must fight each other. On that note, we still have no answers. The acting and sound are superb. The direction, editing, and score are all Oscar caliber. I don't shrink from saying that this film is the best film of 1998 and one of the greatest war films of all time. The Thin Red Line is the only film to ever make my knees tremble and haunt me days after I saw it. If you see it, I'm sure your opinions will be just as strong as mine.",

More over Terrence Malick attempts to depict the mental and emotional inner workings of soldiers, results in a etheral almost dream like atmosphere.

It's emotionally daring and extremely heart-felt. It's a wonderful work of cinema in every way imaginable. \n\nThe movie takes a look at several soldiers stories as they advance on an island to fight Japanese soldiers during World War II. As the movie progresses, we hear several narrations from different people. The movie does a brilliant job at keeping the audience attached with the characters. You really feel for everyone in this movie...and it's quite beautiful that the film was made in this way. It's something thats not really seen that much...and this movies style proves Malick's integrity and uniqueness. \n\nThe acting in this movie is pretty good. There are a few people that really didn't need to be in this movie, but it seems that a lot of actors wanted to be apart of Malick's return. John Travolta  and George Clooney are examples of two actors who didn't have to be in this film, because they have a total of 5 minutes of film time. But it doesn't matter because they don't take anything good away from the movie as a whole The actors in this movie that are worth paying attention to are Sean Penn and Jim Caviezel. These guys were both excellent and the emotions that they convey on the screen really channel to the audience well. \n\nThe movie flows in such a sophisticated way. Malick uses such careful composition when brushing the strokes for each individual sequence. Everything seems to have a purpose and as the movie progresses, you get a perfect understand of his goal and objective with this film...it's truly wonderful. \n\nThe cinematography in this film is excellent. We have beautiful landscape shots, and ocean shots, and at the same time intense battle sequences which stop your heart, in hopes that everyone will make it out okay. It's really a beautiful display to look at. \n\nHans Zimmer as usual gives us a beautiful composition. The amazing soundtrack helps put the pieces together to make this movie compassionate, and aesthetically brilliant. Everything about this movie just works. \n\nLike I said, it really is just a fascinating piece of cinema. Malick did an unbelievable job in this movie, and the wonderful performances by the actors help make the move what it is. It's an interesting look on war, as well as a ingenious study of the soldiers who fought in it, displaying and conveying there thoughts and feelings. This movie is beautiful, and it needs to be seen.",

What seed, what root did it grow from? \r\n\r\nA company of U.S. soldiers vie for control of of the Japanese island Guadalcanal, but encounter heavy resistance both from enemy fire, and themselves.\r\n\r\nBefore one even pops in the film one will notice the star studded cast on the back of the boxes' credits, and by no definition does it disappoint, The Film is absolutely littered with as many great performances as dead bodies. Though the characters infrequently converse with one another at length, that fact does not diminish the actors' achievements.\r\n\r\nGuadalcanal is apparently a beautiful island, and the film concentrates heavily on said beauty, lingering over plants and wildlife, the script even manages to make a dark connection between man, environment, and war. Though i could have wished for the script to delve a little more into the relationship.\r\n\r\nWhich leads me to the biggest complaint of the film, the script. What is present in the script is powerful sure, but too many scenes are staged perfectly for a long insightful conversation between characters but rarely if ever, does the film deliver. The Thin Red line as a whole lacks a true cohesive plot, as the island is all but won halfway through the film. Instead the film moves from gunfight to gunfight with thoughtful little injections of philosophy used to hold the film together. It more times than not leaves you wanting much more.\r\n\r\nThough flawed, The Thin Red Line is more memorable than its score conveys. Its a thrilling piece of philosophical work, an excellent foil and companion piece to Saving Private Ryan.",

As Sean Penn's weary Sgt. says: \"What difference d'you think you can make? One man in all this madness?\", or Jim Caviezal's ethereal Pvt: \"Maybe all men got one big soul everybody's a part of, all faces are the same man.\" Even the likes of Gary Oldman, Viggo Mortensen and Mickey Rourke ended up on the cutting-room-floor and not getting a look-in with the impressive ensemble of actors. However, this is a film without any movie-stars, despite the names involved. John Travolta, John Cusack and George Clooney appear and disappear, reduced to mere cameo appearances and the likes of Adrian Brody and John C. Reilly hardly get a word to say. The cast alone shows the clout and attraction that Malick still has after being absent for decades. All these faces, among many others, coming and going all add to the confusion of war and several long, dialogue-free scenes, paint a dreamlike quality to the film.\n Malick is methodical in his direction but still very capable of handling explosive battle scenes and conveying the torture and terror of the soldiers' suffering amongst the carnage, aided no end by John Toll's gorgeous, visually striking cinematography. \n This modern masterpiece was shamefully overlooked come award season and over-shadowed by \"Saving Private Ryan\" on it's release - which is unfair, as they are very different films and this is just as good, if not better, than Spielbergs take. \n It's a poetic war film, if that were ever possible. A rich, meditative and complete work of verbal and visual artistry. Simply superb.",

It felt more of an attempt to make an artsy movie that just happens to be a war movie as well.  What director Terrence Malick (The New World) doesnt do is form an emotional connection with many of its characters  those played by George Clooney (The Men Who Stare at Goats), John Cusack (Americas Sweethearts), John Travolta (Hairspray), and John C. Reilly (Cirque du Freak: The Vampires Assistant)  and short-changes those who the story appears to focus on  Jim Cavizel (The Rock), Adrian Brody (Predators), Woody Harrelson (The Messenger), and Elias Koteas (Shutter Island).  In fact, really only Nick Noltes (Tropic Thunder) character seems to make sense; when the film isnt trying in vain to focus on Sean Penns (Mystic River).

He has a very spiritual presence in this film and his work here is very affecting. The actor that I always seem to remember in this film though is Nick Nolte. Watching him as he pushes his platoon to the point of death for the sake of advancement, it is simply put, a ferocious experience.\r\n\r\nThe main draw for this film thiough is the visual palate that Malick and co present us with. This is a beautifully shot and framed film, every image has a depth that is quite unlike anything else out there. The juxtapositions between the beauty of nature and the horror of combat are stark and wonderfully effective.  I particularly love the graceful shots as the camera moves through the creeping grass.

The performances in this film are exceptional; Penn, Nolte, and Caviezel all take turns in the spotlight.\r\n\r\nHans Zimmer does a tremendous job with the music in this film, Every dramatic scene was supported by a great great musical number.

Arrancar respostas emocionais superficiais da plateia via exploração de sangrias humanas pode bastar como intento de artistas cujos intelecto e sensibilidade sejam comparativamente inferiores em sofisticação (como Zwick); alheio às armadilhas do convencionalismo, Malick mira a exposição de problemas que ensejam a indagação.

I watched it about a year ago and new it was a masterpiece and then rediscovered it the other day and just had to mention it. \n\nFor those of you already familiar with Mr. Malick this review won't hold many surprises. (Enter gushing sophomoric film student review here.) \n\nWhen you watch a film by a man who obtained his degree in philosophy from Harvard and who dropped out of the doctoral program at Oxford because of a quarrel over the concept of the world in Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein it's a safe bet  to say that the film will have some heavy notions.\n\nSo instead of addressing the consummate amounts of philosophical theory floating around in this script in regards to life death, war, sin, love, peace, existence, symbiosis, existentialism, and so on and so forth I'll focus on the execution. \n\nI was worried that this film would be all bark and no bite in lieu of an experienced action director. I was wrong. The visuals pirouetting in and out of tranquility and turmoil. Malick's aesthetic conductors baton is never out of tempo for even a moment. His gratuitous use of steadicam once again proves to be one of the keys to this success. \nFor an instrument that is more often that not, used in excess and in the wrong situations I find nearly impossible to believe that most of this film was shot atop a steadicam, and I never once regretted it being there.  \n\nTerrence has teamed up with director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki for the first time (though they have now worked together 3 times with The New World and The Tree of Life) to create a world that we have literally never witnessed before.\n\nI would expect no less of a Discovery channel expose' or a piece from National Geographic, but a Hollywood film? This transcends filmmaking in my mind. Bridging the gap between narrative and documentary, his visuals and his dialogue tell a different and yet the same story at once. \n\nI could feel the command seeping out of every frame.",

Malick isn't that interested in telling a compelling story with fleshed out characters. Instead, his characters are puppets through which philosophical ideas and quandaries about life, death, and humanity are posed, often via internal monologue. On one hand, this makes \"The Thin Red Line\" a thought provoking film with a poetic spirit. On the other, it keeps its audience at an emotional distance that makes it difficult to fully invest. With the aid of John Toll's magnificent photography, Malick juxtaposes the unnatural destructiveness of war against the natural splendor of Guadelcanal where it's set, as though to suggest that war is an affront to nature. And with the aid of Hans Zimmer's uncharacteristically toned down score, a well articulated sense of unease is achieved.",

There are some speedy battle scenes, but what truly grabs my heart are those shots of the nature - creatures, trees, skies, water, fire...

An original in every sense of the word.  Director Terrence Malick is back with a vengeance, touching on issues that no other director would dare to go.  It's about religion, emotion and psychology and how they all tie in to the overall experience of war and battle.  It's packed with action and intensity, the battle sequences are very well made.  The story is very well written and executed to the point that it will leave the viewer breathless and emotionally drained.  Some of the most complex issues of war are captured on film in a way that will surely touch you.\n           The Thin Red Line is packed with star power, I mean absolutely packed.  Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, and Sean Penn are show stoppers Tay put forth brilliant performances.  It also features performances by Woody Harrellson, John Cusack, Jared Leto, Adrian Brody, George Clooney, John Travolta, and Elias Kotias.  Hollywood truly came together for this epic war story.  \n            Its one of the best war films ever made, along with the likes of Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, and Flags of Our Fathers.  An academy award winning film that is deserving of every award that it received.  No other film captures the all the aspects of battle with such an intensity as this movie.

I didn't love it, and I can only give it points for the impeccable cinematography and, well, that's pretty much it. Once again, Malick has crafted an absolutely gorgeous film with, unfortunately, some of the most pretentious dialogue and phoned-in performances I've ever seen. When a film takes nine years to gestate, shoots over a million feet of film, has an original cut that clocks in at over six hours, cuts out entire performances of actors such as Mickey Rourke, Viggo Mortensen, and Gary Oldman, and reduces actual performances in the film to a few lines, it's bound to be a misguided, absolute mess of a film; and it is. I have yet to be convinced that Terrence Malick is a 'good' director; good directors make films that are actually watchable, not films that can only be rewarded for 'some' aspects that are fascinating. A film must be wholly satisfying on every level, and Malick's films hit and miss on most levels. I'll give it another chance some point down the line, but for now, I'm not impressed.",
