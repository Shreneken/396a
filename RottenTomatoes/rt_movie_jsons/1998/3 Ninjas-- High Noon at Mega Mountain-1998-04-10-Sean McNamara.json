O'Laskey II), Rocky (Mathew Botuchis) and Tum Tum (Victor Wong) go to an amusement park to get a glimpse of their idol, action star Dave Dragon (Hulk Hogan). But when evil masterminds Medusa (Loni Anderson) and Lothar Zogg (Jim Varney) descend on the park, the boys are thrust into a real-life shoot-'em-up. Now they must use their martial-arts training to defend the park's helpless guests -- getting a little assistance from their longtime hero.",

Anyways, three very white Caucasian kids practising martial arts with their Japanese grandfather, coincidently thwarting a gang of hijackers lead by Medusa(Loni Anderson from WKRP fame) for millions of dollars from the owners of the \"Mega Mountain\" theme park.  It's the youngest brother of the '3 ninjas' birthday, and he wanted to celebrate it at the Mega Mountain them park.  At the same time, Dave \"Dragon\", ridiculously played by Hulk Hogan, is trying to prevent himself from being cancelled from his long running syndicated television show- also filmed on the 'Mega Mountain' theme park.  \r\n\r\nThe perfect movie intended for pre-schoolers, and a complete waste of time for anyone 8 years and up, considering what kids can watch these days from super hero movies and so forth.  It says on the commercial box that 'it's fun for kids' quotation from well known critic from RT by the name of Rex Reed, who may have been paid to endorse this movie.  One of the stupidest things I had ever saw was when, the so-called \"three ninjas\" are supposed to be fighting the bad adult ninjas in the dark, yet viewers can clearly see that it's still bright enough for them to see their fighting opponents.   Movie, clearly made for white suburban white kids. \r\n\r\nBomb, plus another minus 5",

            "content": "The Three Ninjas (now played by Mathew Botuchis, Michael O'Laskey II and JP Roeske II) are back, and are celebrating \"Tum Tum's\" (Roeske) birthday at Mega Mountain Amusement Park (Elitch Gardens in Denver, Colorado) with the new neighborhood girl, \"Amanda\" (Chelsey Earlywine), who is a computer genius and a klutz at times. \r\n\r\n\"Tum Tum\" is anxious to meet his TV hero, \"Dave Dragon\" (\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan), who is making a personal appearance at the amusement park after it is announced that his \"Power Rangers\" type television series was cancelled by the unnamed network airing it. \r\n\r\nWhat the kids and the actor don't expect is that an insane woman known to authorities as \"Medusa\" (Loni Anderson), along with her right-hand man \"Lothar Zogg\" (Jim Varney) and a group of thugs which include her inept nephews are planning to take over the park and hold all the guests and employees hostage for $10-million. \r\n\r\nNow, the \"Three Ninjas\", a computer geek and a soon-to-be out of work actor have to join forces to save the park and the people from \"Medusa's\" evil plan. \r\n\r\nThis movie is almost as good for adults as it is for kids. There is some good martial arts fights, and some comedy that could give the adults watching a pretty good chuckle. However, the adults will realize that there is some bad performances in this movie. \r\n\r\nAnderson is just out of place as the lead villainess, and she really doesn't make her performance believable in my opinion. She delivers her lines with no effort in making people believe that she is insanely evil as she could have. Varney was better as a villain, in a comedic way that he was known for, however he didn't have that much screen time or lines. \r\n\r\nHogan, who was the top villain in the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling at the time of this movie's production and release, was only fair as the martial arts actor who didn't really see much physical action as the lead actors did. The most physical action he did was throwing some punches and some simple moves he uses in professional wrestling that were suppose to be intentionally set up (he was on stage when we meet him, fighting with some stunt performers). It is also hard to believe that an actor would try to take on a group of thugs by himself when he tells the kids, whom he doesn't know has martial arts training from their grandfather (Victor Wong, who is the only actor to appear in every movie in the \"3 Ninjas\" franchise and in his final movie before health issues forced him into retirement around the time of the movie's release). \r\n\r\nAnother thing that is hard to believe is that four kids are able to thwart the efforts of villains. Especially ones who are seriously out-numbered by a group of bad guys with machine guns, which they use but never hit their intended target EVER. \r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this movie is that the new characters we are introduced to in this movie are barely developed. We get the villains' motivation for taking over the amusement park, but that's it. We also get that \"Dragon\" is not really the hero like his television persona portrays him to be, and that he tries to be the hero that the children who watched his show have looked up to (as evident by a child who comes up to him and asks him, as he is laying on the ground, if he is a hero or the fraud his father says he is). \r\n\r\nLike in previous movies in the series, only one of which I have actually seen, there is some good martial arts stunts in this movie. The kids are pretty quick with their moves, and are pretty good in the fight scenes. However, many times when Roeske is featured in the fight scenes, it is pretty obvious that the people he is paired up with are setting themselves up for his next move as they are positioning themselves so that he can hit them in the right spot. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the four lead actors, they work pretty well together. Sometimes, they don't deliver their lines perfectly or have expressions on their face that doesn't look believable. \r\n\r\nThis movie, like the entire series, is pretty much for the kids. Adults won't like everything, but there is some things they might like -- as long as they can get past the poor performances and writing.",

Before we all start hating on Hulk Hogan, let's take a look at Loni Anderson who, by far, takes the 'Most Wooden Performance Award' of the century. She was not convincing at all as Medusa and if this is a kids' movie, why was she wearing that skanky outfit? She was much better on 'WKRP in Cinncinati'. Mr. Varney steals the show and I would've been happy to see him in every scene. He truly oustshines the entire cast, including the three ninjas themselves. I was actually rooting for Lothar to be successful in his mission. Tum Tum's yells started grating on my nerves after a while. Medusa's nephews, where do I start? How did they ever break into the theme park? All, but Lothar, didn't have the intelligence to do such a thing. Ok, Victor Wong was great, too. Maybe if Varney had cast and directed this movie, it wouldn't have flopped. Only Varney seemed to give 100% to his role. The rest? Well, I would've been satisfied if it was a one man show staring Varney. Oh, wait, I have his commercials. Now, that's worth watching repeatedly. If you're really, truly a fan of Varney's then you might want to get this simply for him and in his memory. If not, leave it in the bin.",

Of course semi-retarded karate ninjas invade the park and its up to the 3 Ninjas to save the park as well as their girls. How this movie ended up on my Netflix queue, I have no idea. I know I am really into theme parks and this takes place at a theme park, thats the only reason I can think of. The acting was of course terrible. I've seen better acting in 1960's era horror movies. There were mess-ups all over the place im the film and in the script. It seemed to be a film that was thrown together at the last minute and seemed to mainly focus on promoting the careers of Hulk Hogan and Loni Anderson. The film is suitable for the whole family.

            "content": "The Three Ninjas (now played by Mathew Botuchis, Michael O'Laskey II and JP Roeske II) are back, and are celebrating \"Tum Tum's\" (Roeske) birthday at Mega Mountain Amusement Park (Elitch Gardens in Denver, Colorado) with the new neighborhood girl, \"Amanda\" (Chelsey Earlywine), who is a computer genius and a klutz at times. \r\n\r\n\"Tum Tum\" is anxious to meet his TV hero, \"Dave Dragon\" (\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan), who is making a personal appearance at the amusement park after it is announced that his \"Power Rangers\" type television series was cancelled by the unnamed network airing it. \r\n\r\nWhat the kids and the actor don't expect is that an insane woman known to authorities as \"Medusa\" (Loni Anderson), along with her right-hand man \"Lothar Zogg\" (Jim Varney) and a group of thugs which include her inept nephews are planning to take over the park and hold all the guests and employees hostage for $10-million. \r\n\r\nNow, the \"Three Ninjas\", a computer geek and a soon-to-be out of work actor have to join forces to save the park and the people from \"Medusa's\" evil plan. \r\n\r\nThis movie is almost as good for adults as it is for kids. There is some good martial arts fights, and some comedy that could give the adults watching a pretty good chuckle. However, the adults will realize that there is some bad performances in this movie. \r\n\r\nAnderson is just out of place as the lead villainess, and she really doesn't make her performance believable in my opinion. She delivers her lines with no effort in making people believe that she is insanely evil as she could have. Varney was better as a villain, in a comedic way that he was known for, however he didn't have that much screen time or lines. \r\n\r\nHogan, who was the top villain in the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling at the time of this movie's production and release, was only fair as the martial arts actor who didn't really see much physical action as the lead actors did. The most physical action he did was throwing some punches and some simple moves he uses in professional wrestling that were suppose to be intentionally set up (he was on stage when we meet him, fighting with some stunt performers). It is also hard to believe that an actor would try to take on a group of thugs by himself when he tells the kids, whom he doesn't know has martial arts training from their grandfather (Victor Wong, who is the only actor to appear in every movie in the \"3 Ninjas\" franchise and in his final movie before health issues forced him into retirement around the time of the movie's release). \r\n\r\nAnother thing that is hard to believe is that four kids are able to thwart the efforts of villains. Especially ones who are seriously out-numbered by a group of bad guys with machine guns, which they use but never hit their intended target EVER. \r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this movie is that the new characters we are introduced to in this movie are barely developed. We get the villains' motivation for taking over the amusement park, but that's it. We also get that \"Dragon\" is not really the hero like his television persona portrays him to be, and that he tries to be the hero that the children who watched his show have looked up to (as evident by a child who comes up to him and asks him, as he is laying on the ground, if he is a hero or the fraud his father says he is). \r\n\r\nLike in previous movies in the series, only one of which I have actually seen, there is some good martial arts stunts in this movie. The kids are pretty quick with their moves, and are pretty good in the fight scenes. However, many times when Roeske is featured in the fight scenes, it is pretty obvious that the people he is paired up with are setting themselves up for his next move as they are positioning themselves so that he can hit them in the right spot. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the four lead actors, they work pretty well together. Sometimes, they don't deliver their lines perfectly or have expressions on their face that doesn't look believable. \r\n\r\nThis movie, like the entire series, is pretty much for the kids. Adults won't like everything, but there is some things they might like -- as long as they can get past the poor performances and writing.",

            "content": "The Three Ninjas (now played by Mathew Botuchis, Michael O'Laskey II and JP Roeske II) are back, and are celebrating \"Tum Tum's\" (Roeske) birthday at Mega Mountain Amusement Park (Elitch Gardens in Denver, Colorado) with the new neighborhood girl, \"Amanda\" (Chelsey Earlywine), who is a computer genius and a klutz at times. \n\n\"Tum Tum\" is anxious to meet his TV hero, \"Dave Dragon\" (\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan), who is making a personal appearance at the amusement park after it is announced that his \"Power Rangers\" type television series was cancelled by the unnamed network airing it. \n\nWhat the kids and the actor don't expect is that an insane woman known to authorities as \"Medusa\" (Loni Anderson), along with her right-hand man \"Lothar Zogg\" (Jim Varney) and a group of thugs which include her inept nephews are planning to take over the park and hold all the guests and employees hostage for $10-million. \n\nNow, the \"Three Ninjas\", a computer geek and a soon-to-be out of work actor have to join forces to save the park and the people from \"Medusa's\" evil plan. \n\nThis movie is almost as good for adults as it is for kids. There is some good martial arts fights, and some comedy that could give the adults watching a pretty good chuckle. However, the adults will realize that there is some bad performances in this movie. \n\nAnderson is just out of place as the lead villainess, and she really doesn't make her performance believable in my opinion. She delivers her lines with no effort in making people believe that she is insanely evil as she could have. Varney was better as a villain, in a comedic way that he was known for, however he didn't have that much screen time or lines. \n\nHogan, who was the top villain in the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling at the time of this movie's production and release, was only fair as the martial arts actor who didn't really see much physical action as the lead actors did. The most physical action he did was throwing some punches and some simple moves he uses in professional wrestling that were suppose to be intentionally set up (he was on stage when we meet him, fighting with some stunt performers). It is also hard to believe that an actor would try to take on a group of thugs by himself when he tells the kids, whom he doesn't know has martial arts training from their grandfather (Victor Wong, who is the only actor to appear in every movie in the \"3 Ninjas\" franchise and in his final movie before health issues forced him into retirement around the time of the movie's release). \n\nAnother thing that is hard to believe is that four kids are able to thwart the efforts of villains. Especially ones who are seriously out-numbered by a group of bad guys with machine guns, which they use but never hit their intended target EVER. \n\nThe biggest problem with this movie is that the new characters we are introduced to in this movie are barely developed. We get the villains' motivation for taking over the amusement park, but that's it. We also get that \"Dragon\" is not really the hero like his television persona portrays him to be, and that he tries to be the hero that the children who watched his show have looked up to (as evident by a child who comes up to him and asks him, as he is laying on the ground, if he is a hero or the fraud his father says he is). \n\nLike in previous movies in the series, only one of which I have actually seen, there is some good martial arts stunts in this movie. The kids are pretty quick with their moves, and are pretty good in the fight scenes. However, many times when Roeske is featured in the fight scenes, it is pretty obvious that the people he is paired up with are setting themselves up for his next move as they are positioning themselves so that he can hit them in the right spot. \n\nWhen it comes to the four lead actors, they work pretty well together. Sometimes, they don't deliver their lines perfectly or have expressions on their face that doesn't look believable. \n\nThis movie, like the entire series, is pretty much for the kids. Adults won't like everything, but there is some things they might like -- as long as they can get past the poor performances and writing.",
