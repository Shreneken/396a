The Dude gets a few chuckles from me in the beginning, but quickly spirals into nothingness masked behind what feels like ad-libbed scenes between Bridges and Goodman. Goldman's delivery was strange and his character really frustrated me because all he really did was shout at the top of his lungs in order to be funny (he never was).",

            "content": "Jeff (The Dude) Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy, chronically unemployed stoner who spends his time bowling with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi) and slurping down White Russians and listening to Credence.  He lives in a dump of an apartment and drives an appalling car.  After a case of mistaken identity, thugs break into his apartment, rattle him up and pee on his area rug (which really tied the room together).  This leads The Dude on a mystery case he is hired to solve involving the kidnapping of young trophy wife of the wealthy wheel chair bound grump of a man with the same name supposedly done by German nihilists.  Along the way we're introduced to some wacky characters including the eccentric daughter of \"The Big Lebowski\" Maude (Julianne Moore), Lebowski's personal assistant Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and the three German nihilists hilariously played by Peter Stormare, Torsten Voges and Flea (yea, Flea from The Red Hot Chillipeppers).\nDirected by the Cohen Brothers, this perfectly paced oddball comedy is entertaining from start to finish.  Even if the story of the botched kidnapping seems all too familiar with Cohen Brother's films, the characters are so fresh and amusing you'll be wishing they would've made a follow up to this film.  Jeff Bridges gives a terrific performance as The Dude.  Plays the character with such ease and delivering lines coyly you can't help but love the guy in spite he's a mess.  Best is when he's having his face shoved in a toilet and when asked where the money is, he simply says, \"It's down there somewhere.  Let me take another look\".  John Goodman is equally good as the hilariously loud, vulgar and naive Walter.  Funniest is Buscemi's character Donnie.  In Fargo, Buscemi plays a character who keeps yapping and never shuts up, in this film, the moment he speaks he's told \"shut the f\u2014k up Donnie\" by Walter.  In fact, there's so much quotable dialogue and absurd humor in this film it's hard not to like it.  Not the Cohen's best film but certainly an enjoyable caper comedy to watch over and over.  Simply put, \"The Dude abides\".",

There is an ongoing issue about a soiled rug and a kidnapping plot that \"The Dude\" is ill-equipped to handle.\n\nBut the movie contains many funny sequences, memorable characters and sometimes laugh-out-loud dialogue.

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nThis movie is very personal to me. The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.\n\nThat said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent. I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.\n\nFirst of all, the dialog specifically. Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned. This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible. Was the dialog even written down? Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character. It's amazing to behold.\n\nSecondly, the storyline's general arch. Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back. In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly. The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations. Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully. This movie could not have ended any other way.\n\nFinally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack. Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly. Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude. Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.\n\n--PolarisDiB",

Just not the Eagles; he had a hard day and he hates the f*ckin' Eagles. Amidst a backdrop of bowling, nihilists, peculiar dance cycles and the War in Iraq, the Dude charms us with his calm insistence that the aggression will not stand, man.

Both things mostly held true: the wife rated this lower for 1998 than mediocre movies like Urban Legend and, while I still thought it was great overall, the back half really did go off the rails at roughly the point where they introduced Maude. The plot is fine in that half but they bury it in favor of giving more screentime to tangents, like visiting that high schooler and the dream sequences, to the point where I zoned out a bit on the actual plot progression. Still, all of the bowling alley scenes and nearly every part Walter is in are pure gold and they far outweigh the shakier bits.

            "content": "The Coen Brothers' cult classic comedy remains a personal favorite of mine.\n\nJoel Coen's direction for his absurdist crime comedy The Big Lebowski (1998) is astounding with surreal dream sequences, creative visuals, and a relaxed tone that allows the audience to just vibe with these iconic strange characters. The Big Lebowski is beloved by stoners, chill dudes, and film fans for a reason. I can revisit this deliriously fun comedy and always find new details, cameos, references, and layers. The Big Lebowski is not laugh out loud funny for simple gags or slapstick, but rather the delightful memorable performances from the outstanding cast.\n\nJeff Bridges feels at home as the unemployed stoner bowler Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski. He's so relaxed and just living his life as chaos swarms him that you have to see his lead performance to see how endearing he is as Dudester. John Goodman's raving Vietnam veteran and bowling enthusiast Walter Sobchak. He should have won an Oscar for his mad insistence about every rule and occurrence in The Dude's life. Steve Buscemi is out of his element as idiotic surfer and bowler Theodore Donald \"Donny\" Kerabatsos. Every time Goodman screams at Donny, I just die. Buscemi plays Donny with a childlike innocence and blissful naivety. Julianne Moore is drop dead gorgeous and downright hilarious as a fast talking, vapid LA artist named Maude Lebowski.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman is a riot as the silly sycophant butler Brandt. His awkward, nervous laughter and gentle voice are just too funny. David Huddleston's role as Jeffrey \"The Big\" Lebowski is fantastic as he bemoans grifters and hippies with equal disdain, while living off his daughter's funds and giving away his allowance to his deadbeat porno actress wife Bunny Lebowski, played by a cute and playful Tara Reid. \n\nFurthermore, Ben Gazzara appears as porn producer Jackie Treehorn in a fun encounter with The Dude. David Thewlis' cameo as Knox Harrington is so funny with his obnoxious giggling. Peter Stormare's nihilist Uli Kunkel, Torsten Voges' nihilist Franz, Flea's nihilist Kieffer, and Aimee Mann's nihilist woman that's Franz' girlfriend are all hilarious. Their whiny and empty threats are no joke and some of the funniest gags in The Big Lebowski. Finally, it's sweet that The Coen Bros. has Jon Polito to be the worthless private detective Da Fino in a great cameo after his phenomenal role in Miller's Crossing. Every acting role in The Big Lebowski has a funny, memorable moment.\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's writing is so sharp that they create this vast LA world full of stoner bowlers, German nihilists, Vietnam veterans, crippled millionaires, and in debt porn stars for us to laugh hysterically at their endless wit, antics, and stories. The Big Lebowski has a complex plot resembling a Hunter S. Thompson or Thomas Pynchon novel, but it's delivered deftly by Joel Coen's silly direction in a framed narrative by Sam Elliott's walking Western homage narrator The Stranger because The Coen Brothers love their Westerns for sure. \n\nThe Big Lebowski feels like a neo-noir in daylight with outrageous characters satirizing the wealthy elites in Hollywood and the impoverished bowling class of LA. The Coen Bros. make all people seem absurd as they go about their weird lives. I like the emasculation undertones as every single man in the movie is doing something for their woman, whether it's nihilists demanding ransom for their girlfriend, Walter watching his ex-wife's dog, Maude giving allowance to her own father, or literally every character forcing the passive Dude character to do something he just doesn't feel like. Let alone, the numerous threats of castration, The Big Lebowski is all about men that are not masculine anymore unlike Sam Elliott's classically tough and cool narrator type.\n\nJoel Coen, Ethan Coen, and Tricia Cooke's editing swiftly cuts around random encounters, brief violence, comfort bowling, and playful flirting for a breezy 117 minutes that feels half that length. Roger Deakins' gorgeous cinematography beautifully captures bowling balls smashing pins down long alleys to characters shuffling around in striking wide shots. The Big Lebowski has as many visual jokes in frame as there on on the script's hilariously written page.\n\nCarter Burwell's score is so whimsical and adorable, adding another level of charm to The Big Lebowski. The soundtrack is calming late 60's songs like Creedence Clearwater Revival jams and unfortunately The Eagles. I love the gag that John Turturro's pederast professional bowler Jesus \"Tha Jesus\" Quintana is introduced while a Spanish language version of The Eagles' \"Hotel California\" plays in the background just so you know he's a bad guy.\n\nRick Heinrichs' production design has The Dude's home a dirty leftover hippie abode, while The Big Lebowski's mansion is all opulence for show. Chris L. Spellman and Mariko Braswell's set decoration has very charming choices. You can tell The Dude is a poor stoner by his apartment in shambles, the other Lebowski has money because of his quality rug, and Maude is a pretentious artist with her Jackson Pollock like painting everywhere. The bowling alley is quite charming and everything looks natural. John Dexter's art direction has lovely choices of smashed cars in fountains to bowling alley dream sequences. Janek Sirrs and Janet Yale's visual effects conjure up CGI bowling pins and space scenery for the adorable and playful dream sequences.\n\nLastly, I have to mention the iconic costumes from costume designers Mary Zophres, Pamela Withers, and Virginia Burton. The Dude's sweaters and robes, Walter's Vietnam fits, Jesus' purple jumpsuit, to Bunny's bikini are all fashion masterpieces. You can immediately recognize any character from The Big Lebowski by their outfits. Seline Jayne, Edouard F. Henriques, and Jean Ann Black's make-up work is excellent with natural looks fitting each person's style. Bridges looks like a messy stoner, while Moore appears all done up like the rich artist she portrays.\n\nIn conclusion, The Big Lebowski is just one fun romp with a chill vibe that never ages.",

This is easily one of the most quotable movies of all time. Every line of dialogue is so sharp and perfectly timed. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are absolutely hilarious and have amazing delivery of even the most mundane conversations. The Dude and Walter are some of the funniest characters I've ever watched onscreen. The rest of the cast are also hilarious, whether it's the magnificent bowler Jesus, the laughably incoherent German nihilists, or even the gleefully unengaged Donnie played by Steve Buscemi.  I love the movie's groovy soundtrack and soothing narration by Sam Ellliot. The movie's outlandish imagery and quick-shot gags are iconic and the film's philosophy of \"dudeism\" is oddly profound.

Its eccentric characters portrayed by a brilliant cast, its comedic dream sequences and its idiosyncratic dialogues make this entertaining movie a hell of a ride and a masterpiece that is extremely quotable.",

Jeff Bridges as \"The Dude\" has to be one of the most iconic and hilarious performances in the genre to date. The Coen Brothers are geniuses as far as I'm concerned when it comes to directing and crafting films like these; everything that transpires ranging from absurd and hysterical plot-progressions and twists while throwing the characters down rabbit-holes of crime, never predicting what will happen next. It's sort of a high-adrenaline trip of a movie this is, while still maintaining a casual-enough pace to keep the viewer on its leash. They just don't make comedies like these anymore. This will probably be a fairly short review, because there really isn't much else I can say. It's certainly a film you just have to watch for yourself, and if you've already seen it (as most of the population pretty much has by now), then you already know what I'm talking about. There's never been a more influential comedy in my opinion.\n\nMy rating - 9/10",

So goes The Dude as he appears in \"The Big Lebowski.\"\n\nMixing the once-disparate ingredients of stoner flick, L.A. noir, and dark comedy with telltale signs of the classic buddy movie, it's likely the genius casting of Jeff Bridges as the leisure-adamant Jeffery \"The Dude\" Lebowski that most acutely prescribed greatness for this one-of-a-kind film. The opportunity for an iconic performance was sure to have gone unrealized if placed in lesser hands, and Bridges' nearly middle-aged, fully self-realized Dude is ignited by terrific fellow slackers of their own unique brands: Endearingly hostile Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and the charmingly carefree Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi) conspire with The Dude to squelch the machismo-driven bowling game of convicted pedophile Jesus Quintana (a remarkable John Turturro). Yet when a pair of arm breakers mistake him for an L.A. fat cat who shares his Lebowski surname, The Dude seeks out this supposed \"Big Lebowski,\" and demands recompense. \"The Big Lebowski\" then begins its next-level ascent to wildly creative zeniths, mixing surrealist fantasy, bowling, and suspect private eye work into a joyously burlesque stew. We dial straight in to The Dude's laissez fare mindset as he wanders into an ensemble of wonderfully sketched characters placed throughout truly fascinating scenes.\n\nIn interviews, the Coen brothers underplay what they must know they achieved with \"The Big Lebowski.\" In Bridges' manifestation, we certainly see the idler -- but we also see the possibilities of a truly carefree existence realized by living comfortably in one's own skin. And that, perhaps, is this comedy's most aspirational of its many achievements. \"The Big Lebowski\" has a seat on the rug in the highest tier of uniquely great films. - (OTHERS TO WATCH: \"Being John Malkovich,\" \"Snatch,\" \"Stadium Anthems,\" \"Adaptation\")",

            "content": "At first glance, The Big Lebowski appears to be a film about a man seeking compensation for a soiled rug. For that reason, I delayed watching it for years, anticipating that it would be difficult viewing.\n\nIn actuality, The Big Lebowski is a pleasure to watch. This is largely because it allows the audience to inhabit the headspace of the Dude, who moves through life unperturbed by external events and material losses. In seeing the world from the Dude's perspective, the viewer is encouraged to avoid getting caught up in the frustrations of daily life and instead cultivate inner contentment, or at least a more laid back attitude. In some ways, the film is disorienting because of the many repetitions in dialogue and setting. I believe this is a conscious choice by the Coens, intended to bring the audience further into alignment with the Dude by emulating the echoes and flashbacks that would be rife in the mind of a 48 year old stoner.\n\nSome critics suggest that in seeking compensation for his rug, the Dude is expressing a latent desire for order and meaning. I disagree with this interpretation. The Dude's uncharacteristic attachment to the rug is what embroils him in a string of calamitous events that test his equanimity. In my view, this is intended to convey that suffering is caused by attachment to material objects. The Coen brothers have rejected the notion that the film is conveying any particular message, so there is no definitive answer here.\n\nThis film inspired me to try my first White Russian (or as it is jokingly called in the film, a Caucasian) the following day. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction to the beverage and fainted in my driveway before being taken to hospital. I will therefore always have a strong sense memory associated with The Big Lebowski.\n\nMVP: Jeff Bridges as pyjamaed hero.\n\nMVQ: \"Smokey this is not \u2018Nam, this is bowling.

I generally enjoy screwball classics, but this was just painful to watch.  The Coen brothers clearly have talent - it has something to do with visual style, offbeat characters and engaging smalltalk, but there is just nothing here.  It falls way short of something like Pulp Fiction - this movie is almost literally about nothing, and not in a good and funny Seinfeld way.  The jokes are so dry, they are dusty.  I smirked a couple of times, especially closer to the end, but I spend the majority of the movie waiting for the good parts, and nothing happened.\nI felt no empathy for any of the characters.  Bridges was a loser (obviously by design) who uses his uh... stoner powers... to solve a kidnapping, and I couldn't have cared less if anything happened to him, just so long as he would stop flashing his underwear.  Goodman had his funny moments, but again, not an empathetic character.  There are lots of other strange characters in this movie, but they would enter and exit the scene and who cares?",

The Coen Brothers littered this tale with memorable characters, quotes, and moments. Jeff Bridges (Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski) is a great actor and this might be the most notable role in his career. He IS the Dude. John Goodman (Walter Sobchak) is hilarious as a crazy Vietnam veteran and John Turturro (Jesus Quintana) nearly steals the show in a small role. The uncaring and laid back demeanor of the Dude makes this one of the more relatable films ever, as we've all had moments where we just didn't care, even when something potentially important happened. The script is fantastic, filled with witty dialogue and several twists and turns to keep you engaged until the very end. \n\nWeaknesses: Visually, this is nothing to write home about. There aren't any shots that would wow you and it's straightforward. The Coen Brothers aren't my favorite filmmakers, so some of their tropes don't click with me. Though Steve Buscemi (Theodore \"Donny\" Kerabatsos) and Julianne Moore (Maude Lebowski) are both usually great, I didn't care much for either performance here. Buscemi felt like he was kind of just there and Moore has been much better in almost everything else. Lastly, in movies, you usually want your characters to somewhat grow. I understand that part of the charm is how little the characters care, but none of them really grow or learn anything.\n\nOverall: I understand the appeal of this film and can see why many people love it. I thought it was funny and witty, with some strong performances, just nowhere near a classic or anything special.",

And on terms of execution there is no doubt on that part as they score majestically on projecting the anticipated vision on screen. On performance level Jeff Bridges is hilarious along with a great supporting cast like John Goodman and Julianne Moore (she is surprisingly funnier than any other cast member). The Big Lebowski had a great potential concept that is piled upon setting the plot and characters way too much that the joke grows shallow and numb when it hits on screen no matter how much they have worked on building it up.",

Sure, there are some nice shots here and there, but apart from a few nice locations and the occasional trippy special effect montage, scenes are ... generic.\n\nThe story in \"The Big Lebowski\" is fairly unique, albeit for its significant unimportance (as said by the writers themselves). Summarised: A mundane, hippyish stoner dude, Jeff Lebowski (more often going by the nickname of \"The Dude\") is mistaken by a bunch of German mobsters for a rich and famous Korean-war veteran with the same exact name. They break into The Dude's home, assault him, and pee on his rug. Thus, The Dude's quest becomes to find a similar rug, because \"that rug really tied to room together\", as he frequently states. In the process, he gets involved in a (plausibly staged) kidnapping - which is never actually resolved during the movie - and comes into contact with various weird characters, all whilst being accompanied by his evenly weird friend Walter: a numbskull, bowling Vietnam-war veteran.\nAs a viewer, I had no idea what anything in the movie would lead up to. One could say a bit of obscurity is a good thing, but having NO direction takes away from overall experience. As such, all characters stay frustratingly flat the entire time.\n\nWeirdly enough, the unimportance of \"The Big Lebowski\"'s story is what makes it relatively enjoyable; clearly, the only focal point is that The Dude doesn't care, which is most probably why the film is so popular. The only realisation a new audience has to make, is that it doesn't have to expect the movie to go anywhere, just like \"The Big Lebowski\" doesn't pretend to be a film to expect anything from.",

Jeff Bridges shines bright as 'The Dude' with an excellent cast, including John Goodman and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, also providing great performances and being the potatoes to this meat and potato pie. The comedy is pretty good and I'll definitely say that more jokes hit than they do fail. That said, I won't say that many jokes in this movie are hysterically funny; I chuckled a lot but I only full on laughed out loud maybe 2 or 3 times. That isn't a massive gripe but it's something I though I should mention.\n\nMy main gripe with this movie is that being intoxicated is probably the best way to see it, and that is not a major gripe at all. The story is pretty basic but works well for what it is attempting to do. Despite this, they set up a lot of character and story arcs that go NOWHERE which was really annoying. That is my second major flaw with this movie. It sets up interesting characters like Jesus and even Donnie but then ignores them or even completely forgets them for the majority of the plot. I would rather the characters not be in the movie, than have them in it for only a minuscule amount of time. The ending(which I love by the way) is very open and allows a lot more possibilities for sequels where they could have explored these characters more and gave them more depth instead of cramming them all into this one movie.\n\nEven with these flaws, the movie is very damn enjoyable. Its incredible, colourful, imaginative characters really drive the movie and they are what makes this movie shine. That is why I wanted more time going to some of the supporting roles. A lot of effort was clearly put into these characters and I wish they got more screen time to bloom.\n\nIt's a very technically proficient movie; the cinematography is pretty good. The set and costume design is great. I have no real flaws with this movie as far as sets and camera-work goes. Maybe a few changes to character and set design but I can't say it was anything that really hindered my enjoyment.\n\nAll in all, this movie is very enjoyable sober(and I imagine even more so while on something) therefor I do recommend this movie to anyone, so long as you're prepared to possibly have a breakdown during a few sequences of this movie. It's a very enjoyable movie, and I'll rate it 8 rugs out of 10.",

Due to its popularity that has only increased over the years, it is the subject of over-analyzation. It is not philosophical, but an exaggeration of everyday problems. Everyone remembers the scene when Walter pulls a gun on a man for stepping over the line in a bowling tournament. This is of course, an exaggeration of when someone makes a little mistake. Our protagonist got one of his best friends killed because a hit man urinated on his rug. The whole story is simply a melodramatic allegory for revenge. It \"is about an attitude, not a story,\" which Roger Ebert used to open his 4 star review. I do not remember the film for it's satirical quirks, but its quick-witted humor. To not laugh in this film is to not cry at the end of It's A Wonderful Life.\nOur main character is called \"The Dude,\" who is the ultimate embodiment of laziness. He is a slouch, a stoner, and a no-life (he listens to the sounds of a bowling balls hitting pins while laying on the floor), but he understands the concept of what a decent human being is and, to be honest, he is not a bad man. He knows when to say something and when to keep your mouth shut.\nThe film is by the brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, who have made such great films as \"Blood Simple,\" \"Fargo,\" \"Barton Fink,\" \"Miller's Crossing,\" and \"Fargo.\" They are, like the tough-as-nails Samuel Fuller, dedicated to avant-garde filmmaking. The Big Lebowski is their best film.",

But I think the majority of people who have seen this film know that its a lot more than that but no one really knows why.\n\nThe film is all about Jeffery Labowski (Jeff Bridges) who goes by the name 'The Dude'. Never explained why, just the dude. Which I think adds to the charm of the movie. Nothing is really explained it just is. Three Germans with a pet marmot? Just except it. The personality of 'The dude' is cleverly translated in to the overall tone of the film even to the end where the last line is ' The dude abides' and he walks off with so many plot points still going on, this film doesn't know the sense of closure but oddly. It works very well. I don't know why I decided to write a review to this film as it's already achieved a cult following and anybody with a Blu-ray player knows what it is but I think a film like this where it apologetically does what it wants is what we need in cinema today. For a further example, just look at the front cover, one of the key characters is 'Jesus'. Their pedophile rival in bowling, there were so many vital characters to the plot they could of included instead but they didn't. Also, there are many scenes that they left in that wasn't needed. \n\nIn an interview I watched about the Coen Brothers they stated that they work on a moment of a film first and work the plot around it and I think that becomes most apparent in this film. I feel like maybe its a get out of jail free card to say this movie just works but it's true. It has a certain charm to it and I am not surprised that it's as popular as it is. This movie definitely is a hole in one (Bowling puns).",

Much of the appeal of this film is the cast, particularly Jeff Bridges as the Dude and John Goodman as Walter, who both give the best performances of their careers.  Bridges attacks the role of the Dude with hilarious precision, making him a likable bum you can't help but root for.  While he is out to make a quick buck, or at least get his rug replaced, he never wants to hurt anyone and has such a sweet nature when he just wants to go bowling with his friends.  Goodman is his polar opposite but equally hilarious as Walter, a Jewish veteran more than willing to pull a gun during a bowling match but doesn't like to work during the Sabbath.  Together, the two are one of the funniest pairings in film in recent decades and make it well worth watching by itself.  Behind the camera, the Coen Brothers deliver a fun satire on detective films, the idea being the detective is someone as dumb as the Dude, which does lead to much of it's hilarity.  However, they go too far in some of their eccentricities (Juilanne Moore is fun but a bit out there as the femme fatale while I still have no idea what David Thewlis was doing in this movie).  It isn't quite as polished as their classic comedy \"Raising Arizona\", but still lots of fun, if only for Bridges's & Goodman's brilliant performances.  Not a perfect film but well worth viewing.",

Sure it's good and all, but it doesn't seem like that I was promised from all the positive reviews and pop culture that praise it so much.  Maybe it's because of some deeper meaning that I don't understand, but it just seems so-so to me.  It does have and good cast, Jeff Bridges seems a little crazy and his hallucinations are just weird to watch, and hard to follow.   Sometimes I laughed just wondering what was going on, and I couldn't tell if I was meant to at all.  The acting is good, and the script is impressive, yet the plot is nothing special and extremely unrealistic, I'm not saying that's a big issue however.  It was amusing at least, the story was ok but an interesting watch, although it's nothing overly special. Overall it's a ok movie, it's still in my genre, but maybe just not my style I guess. Don't know why I didn't find it as good as I thought it would be, but glad I can say I've seen it now at least.",

            "content": "The Big Lebowski has to be one of the most absurd movies I've ever seen. It's practically plotless. Its comedy is gleefully absurd. And it doesn't once try to be something it's not. As always, I admire the Coens for going so out there and not caring if they lose a majority of viewers along the way. It features incredibly vivid characters in unbelievable situations. Is it lacking something more? Of course, but it's still a ton of fun.\n\nThe film is a story of mistaken identity on steroids. Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), aka The Dude, is a stoner stuck in the 1960s. He doesn't work, doesn't really change his clothes often, and spends all of his spare time bowling with his friends, the loud and proud Vietman vet Walter (John Goodman) and the mild-mannered bonehead Donny (Steve Buscemi). One evening, The Dude is accosted in his own home by two men looking for a The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston), one of Los Angeles' wealthiest businessmen.\n\nAfter the crooks soil his carpet (which perfectly complements the room), The Dude sets up a meeting with this other Lebowski to settle the debt. Things don't exactly go as planned, but shortly afterward, The Big Lebowski contacts The Dude again with a proposition. His wife, Bunny (Tara Reid), has been kidnapped, and he wants The Dude to deliver the $1 million ransom. The Dude obliges, but his ineptitude, combined with the ineptitude of everyone around him, causes things to veer off the tracks quickly, and no one quite knows exactly how it happened.\n\nWhile the plot takes a lot of time to set up, there really isn't much of it to speak of. Once we know how the characters relate to one another, the film plays out like a series of hilarious vignettes. Everyone has a different agenda, so nothing goes as planned. It's all just a riot to watch. I can only imagine how much fun it would have been in a, um, different state of mind.\n\nAnd as much humor is derived out of the outlandish circumstances of these character, even more is derived from the way they speak to one another. \"This is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass,\" \"Donny, you're out of your element,\" and \"Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos,\" were all-timers for me. Walter is one of the funniest film characters I've seen in years, and while I've found John Goodman's manic tendencies a little much in previous Coen efforts, like Barton Fink and Raising Arizona, I thought he was perfect for the material here.\n\nThe star of the show, however, is Jeff Bridges' Dude. The character is larger-than-life, a real cult figure, yet he somehow doesn't disappoint. Is Bridges' performance amazing or anything? No, not really. But he's perfect. He is The Dude. There is no Dude without Bridges. And as good as he is in serious fare like Crazy Heart and True Grit, this is probably the performance he'll be remembered for-if for no other reason than the character is a legend.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is far from a perfect film, but it's so much fun to watch that any and all flaws are forgiven. The Coens eschew plot and conventions in favor of crafting the most absurd story they can. And they definitely pull it off.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/big-lebowski-review/",

This is what I picture the movie to as a whole be about. Even if the conversations could have been cut, its still very good dialogue between the characters. On top of that, I think theres a lot of strong visuals, whether its surreal and dreamlike or more simple and mundane. It's also toped off by some great performances from Bridges, Goodman, Turturro, Buscemi, and Sam Elliot as the narrator. Check this movie out if you haven't already.",

Somehow the Coen Brothers managed to create a pair of hilarious and vivid characters (laid back but put upon Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski and aggressively wrong-headed Walter Sobchak) and situate them in a sprawling \"mystery\" plot that riffs on The Big Sleep, the early 90's, the art world, bowling, pornography, nihilism, and just about anything and everything else that popped into their brains at the time.  But it all holds together (more or less and not worse than The Big Sleep), courtesy of Jeff Bridges as the Dude and John Goodman as Walter, and contains enough laughs to have become a phenomenon.  Just think of John Turturro as the Jesus in a purple jumpsuit taunting our heroes at the bowling alley.  Or the amazing dream montage set to The First Edition (with Kenny Rogers) song, \"Just Dropped In (to see what condition my condition was in).\"   There are dozens more absurd, knowing, and very funny moments.  All you can think is \"who thinks this shit up?  (\"Cussing\" is common here, despite Sam Elliott's suggestion that they tone it down).

What makes The Big Lebowski so great is that it is so much more than it appears to be. This isn't a stoner comedy or anything else it has been labeled, but a brilliant piece of filmmaking that sums America- post Vietnam.\n\nThe Dude is brought into a strange situation when he is mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski. When the Big Lebowski's young trophy wife is kidnapped; the Dude is hired to make a money drop. Then he is soon brought into a much larger game as he is contacted by strange artists, nihilists, and porn producers.\n\nGreat performances from Jeff Bridges and John Goodman and superb writing and direction make this movie a timeless classic. The Coen's have done a lot of great work, from Miller's Crossing to O Brother Where Art Thou to Fargo to The Big Lebowski. It's very hard to choose favorites when it comes to their films because all of them leave you with the same impression, which is that their films are great pieces of art.

I chose this one since I have seen it most recently and it is a pretty simple film with a seemingly complex plot. This is one of the Coen Brothers' best films - not necessarily in the sense of great cinema, but rather in relation to the factor of entertaining the audience. I showed this film to my good friend Spencer just a few months ago and he wanted to watch it again tonight. It is easy to see why since I was quoting/enjoying a lot of the film for its great comedy, such as the many times Walter says \"shut the f--- up, Donnie,\" how the Dude repeats things he hears from other people in order to get his point across, or how ridiculous the narrator's moustache is. I remember that on first viewing I did not appreciate this film since it is revealed by the Dude towards the conclusion that the MacGuffin of the film - the briefcase filled with a million dollars - was never really filled in the first place. Like Fargo, The Big Lebowski deals with the idea that most will go out of their habits or comfort zone in order to obtain an amount of money - however, it does so in a more ridiculous manner than Fargo. After a few re-watches I have found it important to appreciate this film's comedy rather than make sense of the almost non-existent plot in order to enjoy it. Does it matter that The Dude's journey turns into a dead end? No; his journey is still progressive as he goes from not giving a damn about anything to confronting people of the seemingly upper class about using him, and the journey has a great deal of laughs making this a great cinematic experience to enjoy and reflect on the importance of taking things easy in everyday life.",

I understand that the Coen Brothers are \"The Coen Brothers\" because of their unique style, but the mindless rambling of this script feels like a waste of time when compared with the Oscar-winning script of \"Fargo\" a year earlier.  It is unfortunate to see a quality cast that includes Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and Philip Seymour Hoffman used to create such a mediocre result.  They also introduce great characters like John Turturro's Jesus and Sam Elliot's \"The Stranger,\" only to disappear with less than 5 minutes of screentime.  There isn't anything wrong with the acting; rather, this is a script issue.  There is nothing wrong with a screenwriter using to profanity to create realism in a scene but this is a prime example of swearing for the sake of swearing, to the point that we become desensitized to the meaning of the words.  Several segments in this film have no purpose other than the glorification of crudeness.  If they eliminated all of the unnecessary dialogue, the constant flow of profanity, and the random departures from the plot, this film would be 8 minutes long.  I actually found the story to be pretty interesting, ridiculous as it may be, but its presentation was too bizarre to make any connection to these characters.  It is a shame because the rambling of the script distracted from a genuinely inspired performance by Bridges.  You might enjoy this film if you adore the work of the Cohen brothers; otherwise, \"The Big Lebowski\" will leave you disappointed, confused, and annoyed.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers are synonymous with dejected atmospheres, strange characters and unusual plotlines. They are not a pair of directors that resonate with many because their films often remain on one level and never change tone or break the mould. However, the genius of the Coen brothers is that with The Big Lebowski they completely broke any mould in cinema and created a bizarre, outrageous and memorable yet unfortunately baffling film.\n \nThe film\u00e2??s peculiar plot involves a mix of ransom, a bowling league, echoes of the Vietnam War, a case of mistaken identity and nihilism. The film is undeniably confusing as it is difficult to follow and understand what is happening without becoming lost in the abundance of characters, the unconventional dialogue or the inexplicable dream sequences.\n \nThe Coen\u00e2??s stated that The Big Lebowski is loosely based on author Raymond Chandler\u00e2??s type of storytelling that is defined by its complexity and unimportant plot. One of Chandler\u00e2??s novels The Big Sleep was turned into a noir feature in 1946 starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, but it was more about their star factor and relationship in the film rather than the actual storyline. It is so bloody hard to even know what is happening because there was not an emphasis on plot but more on individual characters. Essentially, The Big Lebowski follows in the same footsteps as The Big Sleep as the film is defined more so by its idiosyncratic characters. They keep you entertained the most out of anything that ensues because they are all so weird and nuts! Particularly the male characters leave an impression on you; not one of them could have been replaced by another actor that is how uniquely exceptional they are.\n \nJeff Bridges portrays the title character Jeffrey \u00e2??The Dude\u00e2?? Lebowski and he suits his role so well because he looks and feels so laid back like his character. In one scene he goes to a supermarket in a night robe, a vest, shorts, shades and slippers. Now how laid back and slacking can you get? His voice is mellow just like his personality and he has a face that says to you \u00e2??I can\u00e2??t be worried about that shit. Life goes on, man.\u00e2?? His type of attire and lax appearance endears his character in cinema history as he often wears pyjamas, jelly shoes and does not care what others think about him. He has so many distinctive features that he makes a hilariously likeable protagonist.\n \nJohn Goodman is Walter Sobchak, the loud-mouthed, temperamental Vietnam veteran whose line \u00e2??shut the fuck up Donny!\u00e2?? has probably defined the film the most. He gets himself vexed and goes to extreme measures to settle disputes (whipping out a gun so his bowling opponent does not cheat), but then suddenly he can be calm the next second and silent. Steve Buscemi portrays the unfortunate Donny who is an innocent, good-natured character who takes all the insults that come his way without minding. He is a noticeable character who leaves a mark on you even though every time he attempts to speak he is silenced or ignored. Off topic, there is an interesting theory developed about Donny that he is merely a figment of Walter\u00e2??s imagination because no one except Walter does actually notice him\u00e2?\u00a6 food for thought. Anyway, the juxtaposition of the three main male characters is outstanding; there are so many distinctive features for each character but none merge together.\n \nUnforgettably, John Turturro\u00e2??s conception of Jesus Quintana is possibly one of the most hysterically memorable supporting characters there has ever been on screen. He is a child offender turned bowler wearing a pink jump-suit, a net cap, has a long little fingernail, shines his bowling ball aggressively and retains a think Cuban-American accent. Now that is bizarre ingenuity!\n \nThe dialogue is unconventional as it often strays into topics that have nothing to do with what is going on. It is led by what the characters want to or end up talking about, not what the plot forces them to converse about. This wandering of conversation does provide moments of laughter but the confusion of the plot prevents you from finding other moments comedic or stimulating because you feel detached form the proceedings. Effectively, films that aren\u00e2??t plot-focused must have something else for the audience to indulge in.\n \nThe Big Lebowski has idiosyncratic characters that remain cinematically memorable but on first viewing, it is difficult for the viewer to accept this notion and therefore many will not enjoy it because it needs a few more viewings to be enjoyed. The reason it turned into a cult classic is because over time people understood it for what it really wanted you focus on; however, most people would not watch it again after watching it once. This flaw in the film functions, I would say, as population control for its fan base.\n \nThe Big Lebowski asserts itself in a repetitive Hollywood as a unique picture that leaves you confused and uninterested in the proceedings, but engrossed in the eccentrically diverse characters that have facilitated its cult classic status.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        5/10",

            "content": "The Big Lebowski, the highly anticipated and initially under-received comedy that followed the massive success of \"Fargo\", is by and large the funniest Coen Brother's film. Every detail, large or small, from cast to soundtrack choice, serves to accentuate the innate hilarity of the plot. Our hero is hardly fit for such a title, a dissident stoner with a penchant for Creedence Clearwater Revival, white Russian's, and his bowling buddies. This permanent burnout, who ten minutes previous to the opening action was just writing a bad check for under a dollar at his local corner store, is thrown headfirst into the dangerous realities of the Los Angeles underworld. Mistakenly made responsible for a massive debt to a porn king, a debt accumulated by a much richer, more successful, man of the same name, our protagonist is forced to participate in a non-linear series of twists, turns, double-crosses and greed simply to return to the insignificant state of being in which he enjoyed living. Thematically, this movie examines the role fate plays in the life of even the most ineffectual individual. A must see for the utterly too comfortable. \nImpeccably cast as \"The Dude\" (our protagonist) Jeff Bridges brings undeniable likability to a willing loser. Perhaps even more important to the comedic merit of the film is the decision to cast Steve Buschemi as Donnie and John Goodman as Walter, The Dude's bowling partners, who serve as a sounding board for The Dude's woes. Donnie, a perpetually submissive, weak-hearted, lemming who receives constant unwarranted verbal abuse from Walter, a boisterous, delusional Vietnam War veteran struggling with a divorce, anger issues, and when the appropriate time is to brandish a firearm. Their dynamic as a trio (or a duo and an abused dog) is the corner stone of hilarity in this feature. While all of the aspects of the plot have some degree of comedic sensibility, these bowling alley scenes are light, largely irreverent, and bring a little levity to what would otherwise be a fairly dark, stressful, film (due to the grave nature of consequences involved in the plot).\nIn the case of The Big Lebowski, the soundtrack is very significant with each song reflecting either the tone of the scene or highlighting character traits. T Bone Burnett, a consummate professional and legendary musical figure, was entrusted with the job of assembling a track list. What is rare is that some of these musical choices enhance the comedy of certain characters, for example, Jesus (played by John Torturro) a dirty purple-jump suit wearing sex offender and cocky avid bowler, is introduced mid-bowl to a mariachi version of The Eagle's \"Hotel California\". This helps to highlight the level of disgust our hero has for this fellow. Lest we not forget, The Dude \"fuckin' hates\" The Eagles.\nIn comparison to the Coen Brother's other comedies, The Big Lebowski is the funniest because all of these criteria mesh together perfectly. 2007's Men Who Stare at Goats was very well cast, with many of the same actors from this film appearing in it, but the script was dull, the characters were unlikable, and there was no special connection between soundtrack and movie. Raising Arizona, while painfully funny in its own right and arguably just as funny as Lebowski, (in addition to being a Nicholas Cage movie that doesn't make you hate the Coppola family) did not have all of the aforementioned factors culminate. No special connection between soundtrack and movie, and a lack of actor chemistry. \nIt may not be that little things make a movie, but these little things make The Big Lebowski funnier. This is the best job the Coen Brothers' have done in making a comedy, and its re-watch factor is through the roof. The Dude Abides, and so do I.",

The Dude's stupidity eventually puts a number of characters in danger, including the \"Big Lebowski\", The Dude's best friend with extreme PTSD and anger issues Walter Sobchak, and The Big Lebowski's slutty playgirl wife, who is kidnapped.\nThe Big Lebowski has an extremely large fanbase, complete with conventions and a full religion - I found it to be entertaining but not hilarious, not near as good as critics or fans say it is - it's something new from the Coens and it's arguable to say whether it really worked out - the film's pros consist of its wide array of dysfunctional characters and its unique and trippy dream sequences dreamt in times of worry by The Dude. Cons are some jokes that fall flat and aren't appealing to all - Big Lebowski is intended for a certain crowd and it didn't appeal directly to me, but it had its moments.",

Julianne Moore's Maude was one of my favorite parts of the movie; I love Julianne Moore to begin with, and something about her delivery of each of her lines was so funny.

Philip Seymour-Hoffman and Steve Buscemi were both great in supporting roles (Donny's death made me sadder than it should've).\n\nAbove all, this movie was just super fun. I laughed a lot, I had fun guessing where the plot would go, and I had fun watching all the strange visuals, like the camera view from inside of the bowling ball as it spun down the lane, or the Dude's hallucination.

There are a lot of great scenes of comedic genius such as the scene when they take back The Dudes rug. The whole rug running gag never got old and neither did the plot. The plot follows The Dude being mistaken for the \"Big\" Jeff Lebowski and gets his rug peed on and this leads to The Dude being ordered by the Big Lebowski to find his missing wife. Like I said, this movie is comedy gold, I'm saying everyone has a funny line and has a comedic element to the film. Any scene when they go bowling is hilarious. The villains in this movie are awful villains but still are really entertaining and funny. The cast was really good together and had really good lines. While I loved a lot about this movie, there were some way too over the top parts that kind of lost me for a second or two. Whenever The Dude was knocked out and had a really absurd dream it was kind of hard to figure out what was going on. While it's good to have a lot of fun with those scenes it's important to have me updated on what's happening. The story, despite those select parts never gets boring and never fails to make me laugh. The whole atmosphere of The Big Lebowski was colorful and really crisp and easy on the eyes. If you are into a really funny, entertaining and slightly odd stoner comedy, The Big Lebowski is your perfect movie. A-",

            "content": "If I had to choose my favourite Coen Brothers' film, it would be Fargo. However, if I had to pick the one which most embodied everything Coen, it would be The Big Lebowski, the story of a guy, \"The Dude\" (played perfectly, as always, by Jeff Bridges) whose world starts going a little haywire, and only gets worse from there, with a collection of equally Coen characters (including a female artist who seems obsessed with vaginas, a wheelchair bound millionaire with a prejudice against bums and a Vietnam vet who seems to think that he can manufacture the war into any argument, from drinking coffee to buying an urn) who seem to try to make The Dude's life difficult.\u00a0\n\nIf you're not a Coen brother's fan then I don't know if you should even attempt watching this. And if you only sort of liked Fargo, don't take that as a recommenation to watch this. The inane plotlines, the awkward pauses, the baffling, out-of-nowhere instances, all of them will leave you dazed and confused, even if you're paying attention, so if you're not up for a second viewing, you might as well not watch it in the first place. However, if all that happens in the mind of the Coens (the Coenverse) makes sense to you (not likely), or you enjoy it, then this is definitely for you.\u00a0\n\nWe pick up the story with the Dude, with one of the best character introductions ever, as he comes home to be beaten up and have his rug peed on. This, along with some encouragement from his good friend Walter (John Goodman having the time of his life), inspires him to find the real Jeffery Lebowski and ask him for compensation. Even though he turns him down, Jeffery decides to ask the Dude for his help in delivering a ransom to his wife's kidnappers. Then the ridiculousness begins in earnest, as Walter cinvinces the Dude to do more and more crazy stuff in order to keep hold of the million dollars. The story then gets a little bit more difficult, which I won't go into because of spoilers. Suffice to say that their are Germans, porn videos and a man named Jackie Treehorn involved.\u00a0\n\nThis movie, however, is about four people, Bridges, Goodman and the Coens. You almost feel as if Joel and Ethan are sitting behind you sniggering as you get more and more confused with each scene. They put a camera in a bowling ball and roll it for goodness sake! Their script, too is confusing, with the most hilarious moments often being the most serious (e.g. Walter and the ear or the scattering of the ashes).\u00a0\n\nIf you can sit through it the first time without breaking something, give it a month, then watch it again. That's the standard opperating procedure with most Coen films, and this, as I said before, is the best one of all.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nMARK IT ZERO! The perfect blend of shock, frustration and hilarity in one scene.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell: My previous viewing of The Big Lebowski let my feelings on the middle of the fence, unsure of whether or not my experience was an enjoyable one. The second time around did help me understand the elements that I did and did not like about this film, but it did not put me in a state of gratification that many seem to find from this film. The Big Lebowski is definitely a fun film, and arguably it is the brothers in their most playful (though I have yet to see Raising Arizona or Burn After Reading), and sadly it just wasn't enough for me. I am a fun guy, and I can watch films without getting too high-brow in its content; I love aimless films like Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds, as they are filled with quirky and hilarious characters that only few people have the imagination or courage to paint on screen. The Big Lebowski does have its generous share of hilariously quirky characters, with Brandt being my unquestionable favourite, and the film does a great job in having each of them have their moment to shine and be related to the film's narrative; aside from probably Jesus, whom which I cannot seem to fathom on the character's sole purpose. Playful scenes and funny dialogue are found in every turn, with a layer of surprise in each one. Even with all of these strong elements that I have just stated, why can't I still adore this film? It has something to do with the film's story being too convoluted by the time it reaches to its final act. The film aimed to start itself off telling a North By Northwest style of story, with a man who unexpectedly out of his control has been placed in an awful situation, thugs assaulting him, pissing on his rug, thinking he was the Big Lebowski; this would be the film's protagonist, Jeffrey Lebowski, better named The Dude. The Dude then attempts to gain social justice by asking the actual Big Lebowski to replace what was damaged. Then as more of the story unfolds, the film eventually starts to build and eventually The Dude finds himself in a situation that he never wanted to be in. The Big Lebowski tells a story that is too large and erratic for its own good, if it kept its plot straight-forward and featured less characters, or better yet antagonists, then I probably wouldn't have too much of a problem with this film. Though underneath the film's playful plot, I was able to find some interesting aspects that the Coen brothers were exploring. It was interesting to see the film tackling once again the idea of greed and its relationship with corruption. In Fargo, we could see greed cause corruption in the souls of the characters, but The Big Lebowski shows corruption taking place outside of their own; each individual that Lebowski meets seem to have their own agenda in order to feed their personal desires, thinking that he is just a simple low-life that it does not really matter; and because the protagonist of the film written with such sympathy and not too self-centred, it was easy for me to identify with his struggles, and his aim to balance out the world around him. As I have said, The Big Lebowski is a playful film, and this statement transcends the most in regards to the film's acting performances. It is crystal clear that Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are having a blast with their roles, showing a natural vibe in their laid back attitudes. However, the cast members that brought the most comedic chops is actually Philip Seymour Hoffman and Steve Buscemi, playing roles that are low-key but when one pays attention to them, one would be left laughing until the scene is over. Julianne Moore, one of the greatest actresses of all time, felt out of place in this film; lacking a sense of presence or impact in her performance and trying way too hard to achieve that sense of sophistication that her character requires. I felt similarly with John Turturro and Peter Stormare's roles. The Big Lebowski may be a crowd favourite, and I can see why. I think if I saw this film during the time where I was at the initial stages of being a film enthusiast, or even before that, I might have adored this film to bits with its unorthodox characters and exuberant scenes.",

Clearly I'm late to the party on The Big Lebowski, but I did find it to be extremely funny and highly entertaining. I like how the story starts out small and slowly escalates. A big part of this is prompted by the Dude's best friend, Walter, played by John Goodman. He is easily the funniest part of this film. The way he talks to other characters, overreacts to things going on in the Dude's life, and continuously makes the dumbest decisions imaginable is what keeps this story rolling. Jeff Bridges is also great in the lead role, because he has that very laid-back vibe and I can totally believe he is the type of guy who literally does nothing with his life other than bowling. \n\nThe only thing that doesn't work for me in The Big Lebowski is the fact that so many of the characters are completely insane. It starts to feel like I'm watching a live-action version of a cartoon when we have so many fantastical characters. Even the narrator makes a live appearance in the story, and offers nothing but strange cryptic dialogue. I think the story might play for even more comedy if it was a bit more grounded. If it felt like Walter was the only crazy in a normal world, it makes his antics that much goofier. Instead we get the crazy Maude Lebowski who, for no particular reason, decides she wants to have a child by the Dude. Or there is Jesus Quintana, who almost seems to flaunt the fact that he is a registered sex offender. Still, I can accept the strange world The Big Lebowski takes place in because I had so much fun watching. This is one film I would like to see again sometime, and I'd recommend it to those who are curious but have never watched it before.",

I finally bought this on Blu and it looks and sounds glorious. On the special features, Julianne Moore explains how funny she thought it was and that she had just been a part of something special but that most of the people she talked to didn't quite get it. John Turturro had a different story, he was one of the ones that didn't really get it. He thought it was funny but, him, like critics at that time, thought that movie lacked something their previous efforts like Fargo, had. He said it wasn't until he sat down and watched it with his son that really got it. And now he sees why it's such a comedic classic. So there you go, two different types of Lebowski watchers, the one's that recognize its brilliance right away and those that just don't get it. Though maybe those who don't get it, should take another look. I saw it with 10 people on it's opening weekend. 9 out of 10 didn't get it. I did. I laughed the entire time and loved it immediately. The 9 people with me thought I was nuts. The script is the most quotable and quoted since Casablanca and 16 years later, the soundtrack is still amazing, Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman are still robbed of Oscar Noms and the Dude still abides.

            "content": "The Big Lebowski is a movie that's complex in it's simplicity. At it's most basic it's the story of a guy who gets mixed in with a kidnapping scheme all due to a rug, and at it's most complex there's a noir story any golden age director would be proud of. Of course, a good part of the movie takes place at the bowling lanes. As you can probably tell, this isn't the easiest movie to discuss, but that's all part what makes it so enjoyable. The best thing about the film is definitely our three bowlers, The Dude, Walter, and Donnie. These characters are so memorable and hilarious you could spend a day quoting their shenanigans. There's also kind of a problem with that though, sometimes it seems they're so good that they overshadow the rest of the cast. Sadly, The Big Lebowski sometimes suffers the same issue Trafic had, it's leads are so great the other characters can't keep up with them. They're not bad by any stretch of the word, but when you have to compete with the likes of a crazy war veteran and a hippie with words of wisdom you're gonna have some problems. Back on the good, the story told here is done great. It feels like you're seeing a crime story from someone who is confused about what's going on, and many times you'll feel just as confused as our protagonist. Also you actually start to become invested in everyone, and trust me, you'll tear up a bit at the end. There's also, of course, the insanely quotable lines and scenarios. If you forget about the diner scene or the car destruction then you're out of your element. Even characters the show up for a few minutes are classic, like the unforgettable Jesus and our narrator, the stranger. Overall, despite some flaws The Big Lebowski is a journey that's worth a few walks down, and you won't be forgetting it anytime soon.",

            "content": "The Big Lebowski is a witty contemporary adult comedy movie that had me laughing almost non-stop from beginning to end.  The film follows the life of Jeffery 'The Dude\" Lebowski; an under-achieving, unemployed man with an interest in bowling and a knack for getting into trouble.  The film falls into the typical adult-comedy film genre with its cynical dialogues and adult themes revolving around sex, drugs, and murder.  The main plot of The Big Lebowski begins when two moronic thugs break into the home of Jeffery \"The Dude\" Lebowski, mistaking his identity with that of a millionaire with the same name.  The thugs pee on The Dude's rug before leaving his apartment to bully him into paying a debt that he knows nothing about.  The Dude takes the issue to Jeffery Lebowski; the wealthy man who the thugs originally intended to attack; in order to gain compensation for the ruined rug.  Mr. Lebowski offers The Dude a handsomely compensated job which involved the safe delivery of a ransom payment for the return of his allegedly kidnapped wife, Bunny.   The Dude accepts Mr. Lebowski's offer and quickly recruits the assistance of his friend and bowling mate, Walter Sobchak; a gun toting, Vietnam War veteran with severe anger issues and strong tendency to be violent and mischievous just to prove a point.  Walter and The Dude's antics and deception soon lands them into more trouble than either of them imagined. This was realized when their friend Donny Kerabatsos dies outside of the bowling alley during an attack by nihilist thugs.  Deceit leads to more conflict and before he knows it, The Dude seems to have everyone from Nihilist gang members to the Malibu Police Department to porn industry tycoons wanting a piece of him.\nI believe that editing in The Big Lebowski was appropriate considering the fact that it was a film that involved a considerable amount of heavy drinking and drug usage.  There were multiple cut scenes that transitioned from The Dude's sober, conscious state to a hallucinogenic mind trip/dream sequence.  I deem editing like this appropriate because it helps the view of the film better understand how out of touch with reality The Dude really is, while at the same time adding a touch of silliness to the film.  Sound usage was also considerably effective in the film.  All background sounds effects were appropriate for the atmosphere of the scene and music selection typically consisted of \"trippy\" 1970's rock with a lot of twangy guitar usage to help the viewer feel the disorientation of The Dude's drug and alcohol induced hallucinations.  The scene where Donny died included fast German techno music with a lot of bass in the background.  This was done to help the viewer feel the increased drama of the action scene while the German Nihilist's were attacking.  Cinematography techniques in The Big Leboswski involved mostly realistic settings with a few hallucinogenic trip scenes that definitely fell into the non-realistic setting category.  All of the action and fight scenes involved shots where loose framing techniques were used to help express the energy of the scene.  The scene where Jesus was introduced involved several shallow shots where the background was blurred to show more focus on the character and his actions than the bowling alley and extras in the background.  \nThe social context of this film was set to show that being a deadbeat can be hazardous but entertaining to watch from a third party perspective.  There wasn't any deep, between the lines meaning or morals to been seen in The Big Lebowski, however it was still incredibly enjoyable to me.  I liked it because I find the drug based humor and crude white-trash comedy that this movie is primarily comprised of to be extremely funny. I would absolutely recommend this film to someone who has never seen it, simply because it is funny in an indecent sort of way.   I would rate The Big Lebowski 8 of 10 because it was funny and included a great cast of Hollywood stars.  I didn't give it a 10 because there weren't any truly incredible special effects or plot twists, however I feel that it was a great movie none-the-less.",

And thats kind of all that its got going for it, its all scattershot with no core of any kind.  Fortunately, some of the jokes do really land well, so its not a total failure.  How much one likes it may depend on one's level of esteem for the style of the Coen Brothers, as this movie is an example of some of their more famous traits without the leavening quality of substance and typical narrative.  I tend to like their movies, sometimes alot, but I don't love them.  When it comes down to it, all their movies are confections, very hard not to like but impossible for me to love.  This kind of film more appeals to critics, perpetually desperate for novelty, and to fans whose greatest esteem is for cleverness or perceived originality.  Like other Coen Bros movies, this one indeed has some cleverness and originality, but is even more of a sparkler on a cake than some of the other ones, with less lasting merit to it than, say, O Brother or Raising Arizona.  Definitely one to watch at least once, but whether its one to watch more than once, I'm not sure.",

            "content": "One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  'The Big Lebowski' benefits from having excellent and memorable characters, especially The Dude played by Jeff Bridges and Walter played by John Goodman.  It also has a quirkiness that the Coen Brothers don't always venture into.  The story is basically about The Dude who is actually named Lebowski but also shares a name with a seemingly wealthy Lebowski.  The wealthy Lebowski charges The Dude to exchange a ransom for the life of his young wife Bunny (Tara Reid).  The Dude first meets Lebowski because two nihilists peed on his rug and had mistaken The Dude for a wealthier Lebowski.  Along the way, The Dude meets the enigmatic Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) who is not what I'd describe as prudish and who knows certain secrets about Lebowski.  Then of course, there is a lot of bowling.  The bowling brings up many hilarious situations that may not be related to The Dude's predicament, but it almost gives viewers a more human side to The Dude.  This cast is loaded with stars such as Philip Seymour Hoffman and Steve Buscemi.  Buscemi plays Donny, a friend and bowling teammate to both The Dude and Walter.  To the utter chagrin of Walter, Donny is often lost in conversation but he makes it up by being a great bowler.  Jeff Bridges is phenomenal as The Dude.  He is so easy-going, lazy, clueless, and hilarious, that you may believe he is like this in real-life.  The Dude is obviously the one who wants no part in a hostage situation.  Even eclipsing The Dude is John Goodman as Walter.  Vein, crass, and always eager to talk about 'Nam, Walter is hilarious and excruciating at the same time.  He never seems to help the situation but instead aggravates things.  Both of these men are great.  As one of the Coen Brothers' best, 'The Big Lebowski' will have you rolling on the floor.  Also, don't miss John Turturro as Jesus.  Ha.",

            "content": "\"I'm the Dude.\"  A hilarious Coen brothers classic, and their funniest film ever.  Loosely inspired by Raymond Chandler's work, The Big Lebowski follows the bowling obsessed slacker Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski being hired by millionaire Jeffery Lebowski to deliver a ransom in order to save Jeffrey's wife after a case of mistaken identity leads to an attack at Jeff's home.  Unfortunately, Jeff's friend Walter prevents the exchange from happening as he schemes to keep the money, and the two run into trouble.  This comedy does it best at straying away from clich\u00c3\u00a9s to offer a fresh story of crime, greed, and morality to a desperate audience.  Lebowski uses Joel and Ethan's style of wry humor, eccentricity, and brutal violence, despite being less brutally violent than their classics Blood Simple, Fargo, and Miller's Crossing.  Luckily, there's enough graphic violence and language to keep audiences at the edge of their seats cheering and laughing their ass off.  There are nonstop laughs throughout, and there are moments that remain in forgotten today, and are made better with the sharp dialogue that make this a fresh crime-comedy (I guess it's fresh.  I don't really know.). The laughs are always deserved thanks to smart writing and direction from the brothers, and smart execution alongside the actors.  Joel and Ethan are able to keep the ransom the main focus throughout, as well as keep the storytelling top-notch and coherent.  They are also able to time each laugh with finesse, use Dude as many times as they would use graphic language, and craft unique characters.  They are also able to capture the look and feel of each scene, and execute each scene and comedic moment to a fault, showcasing some of their best work to date.  Under the alias \"Roderick Jaynes\", the brothers and Tricia Cooke add tons of visual appeal to the dream sequences that are both funny and help with the characterization of \"the Dude\", as well as remain convincing under a $15 million budget.  The soundtrack also helps with the scenes, and keep up with the rhythm of the film, and the acting makes it oh-so worth watching over and over.  All the actors live their roles as they were obviously written for them, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman being the best separately and together onscreen.  Bridges captures the laziness and attitude of \"The Dude\", showcasing his most recognizable role to date.  Goodman captures the outrageous temper and rage of Walter, and nails his use of quotes and violence to a fault, and both Bridges and Goodman are able to work together without any hesitation.  One of the funniest films of all time, and one of the best comedies of all time.",

            "content": "I hadn\u0092t seen The Big Lebowski in many years since the time I most recently watched it, but I remembered it being hilarious and predicted that to this day it still would be.\n\nThe Big Lebowski is genius because it takes the concept of a western story and turns it into one of the most original stoner comedies of all time. Through combining a case of mistaken identity, a complicated tale of kidnapping and a lot of characters with rich comedic potential, The Coen Brothers put out quite possibly their funniest film to date.\nThe story is a combination of complicated genres all merged into one hilarious comedic venture which is packed to the brim with clever twists and turns. It\u0092s a kind of comedy that only they could get so perfectly executed, and while it has a few bumps along the way it is consistently hilarious, unpredictable and very original.\nThe stylistic way that Joel and Ethan Coen form a comedy out of the story is iconic of them since it is full of eccentric characters in a weird universe of complicated crime. And their collaboration crafts a strong screenplay out of it. And as a team they direct the story to victory through a lot of hilarious territory and clever plot dynamics. Rarely do they miss the mark, because with such tenacious direction and writing The Coen Brothers manage to give it their all and make it all hilarious.\nAnd they add their own touch of iconic visual style to the film as well, because The Big Lebowski also benefits from a lot of memorably imagery captured by fine cinematography which is one of the iconic elements of Coen cinema, as well as a wide colour palette which is most notable in the iconic dream sequence of the film. \nOf all the films by The Coen Brothers, The Big Lebowski is clearly one of their films more likely to appeal to a wide audience because it a laid back and relaxed comedy like if Clerks crossed over with Date Night, therefore it is less likely to alienate audiences like some of their significantly more melancholic pieces like The Man Who Wasn\u0092t There or A Serious Man. It\u0092s a lot more of a down to earth piece than some of their other features, but that doesn\u0092t mean that it lacks the intelligence or charm of their usual films because it is all still there in The Big Lebowski. Honestly, for anybody attempting to break into watching films by The Coen Brothers, I would recommend you watch The Big Lebowski first and I think you will be pleasantly surprised, because I sure was. \nAnd as common with a really good comedy film, The Big Lebowski is quotable for a lot of memorable comedic lines in the script which easily stick with the viewer and are the source of a lot of comedy.\nBut the most powerful talent at hand in The Big Lebowski under direction from The Coen Brothers is the deducated efforts of a hilarious cast all pulling their own weight.\nJeff Bridges delivers quite possibly his greatest performance to have not been nominated for an Academy Award. In the role of Jeff \u0093the Dude\u0094 Lebowski he is so laid back and chill that it\u0092s utterly hilarious. You\u0092d never expect an actor who gets so dedicated to the involvement of his work like Jeff Bridges to be put into the relaxed role of the Dude, but he does it so flawlessly that its hilarious. The performance is hilarious enough, but to think that it is actually Jeff Bridges making such a chill comedic turn in the movie is just too funny. His performance is unforgettable and one of the highlights of his career, and is undeniably the funniest performance he has ever given.\nJohn Goodman\u0092s performance is most likely the greatest of his career because his over-the-top nature is excavated and harnessed to maximum success by Joel and Ethan Coen, and not at one point does he ever come up short. His portrayal of Walter Sobchak is perfectly hilarious because he uses his ability for intimidation and aggression to characterise the man and he absolutely nails it with perfect comedic time delivery and an undeniably fierce dedication to character. John Goodman\u0092s energy is put on full display in The Big Lebowski and he is perfectly hilarious at interacting with other cast members and nailing the hilarious aspects of his character.\nJulianne Moore\u0092s supporting performance is one that is challenging to look away from. The instant she flies into the screen she projects a dominant sexual appeal overshadowed only by the sharp edge of her quick witted and intelligent line delivery. She makes an effort to dominate the screen whenever she is on it and it proves successful essentially every time because she exerts the talent that made her later go on to be deemed one of the finest actresses of her generation in The Big Lebowski. The Big Lebowski boasts one of her much younger and superior comedic performances, and her talent is no less than it later grew to be. Her role in The Big Lebowski is jut terrific.\nSteve Buscemi\u0092s small role of Donny was pretty good as well. His natural charm as an actor was good but the funniest thing about him is the fact that since John Goodman keeps on proclaiming to him \u0093Shut the f*ck up, Donny!\u0094 which is a reference to the previous film by The Coen Brothers, Fargo. In Fargo, Steve Buscemi\u0092s character could never shut up whereas in The Big Lebowski he rarely speaks, and this proves fairly funny.\nThe performances of David Huddleston, Tara Reid and particularly the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman all made key contributions to the film as well.\nLastly, the cameo by John Tuturro was the icing on top of the cake and had some real comedic virtues to it.\n\nSo The Big Lebowski is a hilarious stoner comedy classic with a lot of intelligence and some of the greatest performances ever given by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman in a comedy film.",

He makes for some hilarious and memorable scenes. The plot to this movie is kind of all over the place. It's never hard to follow or anything, but it is everywhere. I can see people making the argument that is was a really lazy to put such little effort into the plot. If that's your opinion, I won't argue with you. However, I will disagree with you. I'd say lots of effort was put into this plot. It seems that a lot of time was put into making it so it could be complex if it wanted to, but simple if looked at from a certain point of view. That lines up perfectly with the character of The Dude. He makes the plot seem that way. He only focuses on what he cares about and ignores everything else. That is actually quite brilliant and I give major points to the Coen brothers on that one. In the end, The Big Lebowski is a hilarious film, and should be seen by everyone.",

            "content": "This is just my opinion, but The Big Lebowski is an ace comedy. The Coen Brothers don't go for anything more than that, and for that reach, they win. Note the film noir-ish kidnapping scheme of the main story, yet the presentation never feels like an homage to, or parody of, the genre. It's presented as a farce, albeit with some blacker-than-usual jokes. I don't often quote films, so the fact that I quote The Big Lebowski is a testament to my strong liking for it. \"This is what happens when you fuck with a stranger,\" is a quote I frequently use. Its context is much funnier than the line itself though, when Walter, played by John Goodman, so swiftly changes tactics from formal business meeting to wrecking a car. There are no cuts, meaning we can see this change in Goodman. And I adore it. Meanwhile, the freewheeling The Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, responds so entertainingly to his environment. A car following him? Drop the joint, oh shit I dropped it on myself, pour the alcohol, oh shit I'm driving, turn into that tree. These are human mistakes that we can only see someone like The Dude make, and for that, I was able to connect to the film by laughing at the expense of our two main heroes.\n\nNote the classic contrast of Jeff Bridges and John Goodman -- The Dude is chill and genuine, while Walter is self-entitled and opportunistic. Where most comedies would define the friendship as healthy against the obvious odds, the friendship between Bridges and Goodman seems more convenient than anything else. They both like bowling, as well as fucking Donny (Steve Buscemi). That's it, really. At the end of the day, they are their own people and they aren't going to miss each other much, even if death suddenly were to strike one of them. The uniqueness in this relationship doesn't matter much though. Really, what counts the most is how strongly the actors accentuate their defining characteristics, thus making themselves so memorable.\n\nTo take us into the world of the Dude, there is a psychedelic feel to what surrounds the story and characters. We have a cowboy narrator, an acidic 1960s/1970s rock soundtrack, and even more trippy dream sequences. While certainly unusual and sometimes run for longer than needed, they do establish a legendary status for The Dude. Nearly 20 years after the film's release, I hear references, see shirts, and think to myself, \"The Dude really is a legend now.\"",

As for the acting, Jeff Bridges is absolutely perfect as the Dude, the laziest man you'll ever come across, and John Goodman is fantastic as always. The directing even further enhances the comedic aspects of the film, as whole dream sequences adds new layers to the dude in the most awkwardly funny way possible. The pacing is fantastic, and the laughs are by no means few and far between. How Jeff Bridges was not nominated for an oscar is still impossible for me to understand. \n\nThe Big Lebowski is a masterpiece in its own unique way.

Told to rescue Lebowski's wife from Nihilists, Dude has his buddies Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi) to help him out.\r\n\r\nThe first striking image is of Jeff Bridges' legendary character of The Dude, bowler and White Russian drinker concerned about his soiled rug. It's a role in which he fits right into and Jeff Bridges excels his comedic talents in a great role. However, the show-stealer is John Goodman's Vietnam veteran, Jewish bowling partner Walter Sobchak, definitely one of the greatest comedy characters ever! Every quote is memorable and every scene involving him is an instant side-splitter. It is the role John Goodman will forever be remembered for. Steve Buscemi plays Donny, another bowling partner who is constantly told to shut up and John Turturro plays Quintana Jesus in a short but memorable role. The other cast members a pretty good too.\r\n\r\nAs is usual with anything the Coen Brothers do, the story is written very well and delivers a lot of unexpected developments. There are several dream sequences that are done really well. The visuals are great and each dream is different and memorable and funny. The dialogue is memorable a hilarious and definitely makes this one of the most quotable films ever.\r\n\r\nDefinitely one of my favourite films with incredibly funny and featuring awesome characters, The Big Lebowski deliver hilarious lines, awesome visuals and a great story.",

            "content": "\"Smokey, this is not 'Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.\" \n\nWhen this film was first released, I could compare it to the then-unknown Tim Burton project Pee-wee's Big Adventure starring Paul Reubens in his famous persona, Pee-wee Herman. Both films received mixed critical reception. Both eventually became cult films. Both accumulated more positive reception over the years. But in a way I don't understand, Pee-wee's Big Adventure was more successful than The Big Lebowski during its release. As much as I respect Tim Burton (Sweeney Todd, The Nightmare Before Christmas, other things), I find it very strange that this film was a big disappointment at the US box office, while conversely, Big Adventure profited over 40 million dollars. I find it weird, considering this film was directed by the brothers whose filmography at the time consisted of Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, and Fargo. Sure Big Adventure starred the famous Pee-wee Herman, but in the eyes of the people of 1985 (I should also point out the 13-year difference between the two films), the name printed next to the phrase \"Directed By\" didn't mean anything. But most of all, I'm baffled by the score this film receives. 80%?. You have overrated films like Pitch Perfect or Perks of Being a Wallflower receiving scores higher than The Big Lebowski, which of course is both an injustice and a travesty. The Big Lebowski is probably the most quotable movie of all time. \n\nThe thing I liked about this movie the most was the script didn't follow the formulaic and safe way writers try to let their screenplay go through. Writers who do that are normally in the fear of their movie getting bad reviews for being too audacious or too raunchy. They're afraid of being criticized by the most esteemed film critics, which of course would lead to negative publicity and disappointing box office. The Coen brothers were no ordinary writers. The last thing did apply to this movie but if I was Joel Coen or Ethan Coen it wouldn't really bother me. Another thing I loved about this film was the darkly comedic performances of the two main stars, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. Both were very entertaining in their respective and peculiar roles as bowling buddies Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski and Walter Sobchak. Both characters, in my opinion, are legendary and have left a mark on history. And of course, no one can go through a review of The Big Lebowski without mentioning the unforgettable narration by Sam Elliott. The Big Lebowski isn't the same without the deep and gruffly Southern voice introducing us to our laid-back main hero. \n\nIf I were pressed to pick something I disliked about this movie, it would have to be the ultimately unimportant plot. When I first watched The Big Lebowski, there were the eccentric characters, clever dialogue, and unique dream and fantasy sequences. But besides those, there was the unorthodox yet heavy plot that was building around everything, which I found riveting in a weird way (like with Magnolia). *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* I was kind of disappointed everyone involved with the whole thing excluding The Dude and Walter, who were the titular Big Lebowski, Uli and the Nihilists, and Mrs. Bunny Lebowski, were just scamming each other. Originally, everyone thought that Bunny was captured by the Nihilists and wanted ransom money from Big Lebowski. Big Lebowski wanted The Dude, who he met during a previous conversation about the recent defecation of his rug, to be the courier. The plan was to throw the briefcase over a bridge. But Walter, who The Dude apparently invited to the event, ruins everything with his schemes and throws a bag full of dirty laundry over the bridge instead. But as Maude Lebowski explains to the Dude and as the Dude fully explains to Walter and Donny later on, the nihilists are friends of Bunny and all Bunny actually wants to do is pretend to be kidnapped, ask for ransom money, receive ransom money, and pay her debts all over town, most notably to pornographic tycoon Jackie Treehorn. Treehorn's thugs were also the ones who soiled The Dude's rug while they were looking for the Big Lebowski, who The Dude shares the same name with (Exactly why they got mixed up and went looking for the money at The Dude's house instead of Big Lebowski's, which also led to the soiled rug.) In turn, the Big Lebowski actually wanted Bunny to die because of the difficulty of being married to her. So he put a bunch of useless stuff inside a briefcase, closed it, and called the contents \"the money\", in hopes of his wife's captors killing her. In turn, the nihilists tried to intimidate both Lebowskis by mailing a toe painted with his wife's green nail polish (the toe actually from one of the nihilists themselves) and crashing into The Dude's home, breaking his stuff, dropping a ferret (\"marmot\") into Dude's bathtub while he's taking a relaxing bath, and leaving with the threat to cut off Dude's \"johnson\". Walter actually predicted this kind of stuff to happen, and though these predictions were creative, I didn't want it to happen because it would prove the whole story to be pointless. But I didn't get my wish. I know The Big Lebowski's supposed to be a \"Raymond Chandler-esque (dark) comedy crime caper\", but I guess Mr. Chandler's work isn't really for me. \n\nOh, silly me. I forgot to mention to the effectively creepy yet comedic performance by John Turturro as Jesus Quintana. \"You said it man. Nobody fucks with the Jesus.\" Classic. Anywho, I first watched this movie when I was 20 with my friend. I was the only one who made a sound throughout the whole film. After it, all my friend did was turn to me with a blank face, and expressed his feeling of hate he has whenever there is a dream sequence or surreal scene in movie. He said that he thinks stuff like that are random and stupid, which is probably why he hates David Lynch. He never felt any amazement from surreal films and this one was no different. I called him out, saying that The Big Lebowski is a deeply funny dark comedy, not a Lynchian film just because it had weird dream sequences in it. Then he reminded me of people like Kenneth Turan or Todd McCarthy, people who I will never understand for disliking The Big Lebowski. Overall, great quantities of curse words and ultimately pointless plot aside, The Big Lebowski is filled to the brim with perfectly-timed comedic greatness, unorthodox characters, audacious and sharp dialogue, creative dream sequences, and created one of the most influential, known, and legendary characters of all time, Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski.",

With its wacky, labyrinthine plot, hilarious dream sequences, unmatched quotes that have \"Coen\" written all over them, and two of the greatest characters ever written (The Dude and Walter Sobchak), this is definitely the film to beat as the most beloved Coen Bros. film. The Dude abides. And I can take comfort in that.",

What a fantastic script like this needs, are fantastic actors, did they succeed? Of course they did. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne More, Steve Buscemi and more all deliver great performances and making the comedy funnier because of how THEY deliver it, if one of these actors wasn't in this film...

I've always loved Jeff Bridges and his performance as \"The Dude\" is the best performance of his career, after I saw this movie I never saw Jeff Bridges or John Goodman the same way ever again. I don't think its possible for the Coen Brothers to make a bad film and this film in my opinion is beyond perfect. If you are a Coen Brothers fan there is no way you haven't seen this movie yet, however if you some how are and haven't seen the film you are not a true fan until you see it, this film is just a classic film.

The majority of films don't feel very complete, this is a film that completely satisfies by the end even if you recognize plot holes. Jeff Bridges is fantastic, that's a given though, the other supporting cast is also so well put together and comedic, that it's hard to quite contemplate the sheer amount of contemplation that was invested in this project. The real genius is how casual the characters are throughout their obscure scams, at one point Goodman's character is believed to have inadvertently murdered a young woman and he responds with, \"ah fuck it dude, let's go bowling.\"",

Such a simple plot cood create a comedy masterpiece that I will never forget, for two reasons, because I loved it and I will defenitly watch again some day. A great cast and a great plot and a great directing together would never give a bad movie.\n\nThe Coen brothers defenitly direct and write together the best movie of their career, they are really great directors and I say it again, this is the best movie that they have evr created on their career. Jeff Bridges takes the lead role with 100% talent, he was hilarious right next to the rest of the cast and we can clearly remember his fantastic and hilarious (character) perfomance, one of his best perfomances ever, Jeff is known from Iron Man, Crazy Heart, The Men Who Stare at Goats, True Grit and much other movies. Jonh Goodman is amazing as well, he had a kind of character that I love and he was really hilarious, you have to see this movie to understand how talented and funny he really is, Jonh is known from The Artist, Evan Almighty, Monsters, Inc., Cars, Speed Racer and some other movies. Julianne Moore has a good role, I really like her but she didn't had a fantastic or memorable perfomance in this movie, she was just acceptable, she has been better in other movies, Julianne is known from my 6th favorite movie, wich is Crazy, Stupid, Love, she is also known from one of my favorite TV shows, wich is 30 Rock and she is also known from Chloe, Magnolia, The Kids Are All Right, Shelter and some other movies. Steve Buscemi unfortunatly has a very small role, he is an actor that I appreciate and he usually makes me laugh, he had a good role in this movie, but very small, and he was much funnier in other movies, Steve is known from the TV show Boardwalk Empire, he is also known from Fargo, Monsters Inc., Reservoir Dogs and some other movies. Philip Seymour Hoffman completes the main cast, I didn't like his role that much, I guess nowone would make it enjoyable but he was okay in this movie... at least he was chosen to star in it, Philip is known from Moneyball, Mission: Impossible III, The Invention of Lying, Doubt and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has an outstanding cast, wich was necessary to this movie, this movie wouldn't be the same without all of these amazing actors, specially without Bridges and Goodman, who were hilarious and amazing. Overall, one of the best casts for a movie ever.\n\nJeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), or how he likes to call himself, The Dude, is a man without job and no obrigations who doesn't care about nothing instead of being at home and playong Bowling tournaments with his best friend Walter Sobchak (Jonh Goodman). Some guys enter to The Dude's house and make him give them the money, that The Dude hasn't got, they leave and pee on his rug. The Dude stays frutrated about it so he visits the other Jeffrey Lebowski who they thought The Dude was. The Dude is ended up to be payed to catch the guys that taked Lebowski's wife giving them a milion dollars. He gets the help of Walter, wich will help him a lot during this trouble. Don't get wrong, this was just 0,01% of the bad things that happened to The Dude, because the other 99,99% are yet to come... Sow, as you can see, this is no amazing plot, i thought it was a bit interesting, but I guess that nowone in the world would have guess that would become to be the script of an amazing movie, it surprisingly worked. A really simple plot that turned out to make the 134th best movie on IMDb's Top 250.\n\nSoundtrack, well, the soundtrack was fantastic, I loved it, there was no themes or anything like that, but there were some amazing songs in lots of scenes, I really enjoyed to hear them and when I watch this movie again, I will be also excited to hear the amazing songs in it. Great choise for this movie's soundtrack, I wouldn't change anything about the soundtrack.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, I can't belive how can someone not like it, I honestly can't thing about something wrong about this movie, it's just one of the best movies of the 90's. It wasn't nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe, I think that happened just because this is a comedy, but the Awards shoodn't ignore it, this movie is very worth to watch. I'm glad they maked it rated R, the characters cursed a lot and that made them even funnier. Every actor was amazingly chosed to their character, and every actor had amazing perfomances. This is not one of my ten favorite movies, it might be one of my twenty favorite movies, or thirty, or forty, but I'm sure it's one of the fifty best movies I have ever seen. I really loved it and I recommend it to everybody with any age. Overall, this movie is fantastic, it has a simple plot, an outstanding cast, an amazing soundtrack and it's basicly amazing, this is one of my favorite movies and it's one of the best comedy classics ever made with lots of memorable quotes. Amazing.\n\nAmazing movie. Extremely recommended movie, 100% recommended movie. Grade: A+.",

The story itself really isn't that endearing, but it doesn't have to be.  I would enjoy watching these guys interact during one of their more normal days.  The editing, complete with hypnotic montages and typical Coen style, is as entertaining as it is creative.  The profanity is a little too over the top for my tastes, and like I said, the story itself really kind of sucks, but I can see why this is such a cult classic.",

Every character plays a great part - even characters with small parts in the film are memorable (Jesus Quintana perhaps being the most hilariously non-involved). The Coens create a great film which follows The Dude as he is placed in a series of events starting with a pee'd on rug, and leading into run-ins with German Nihilists (bearing a striking resemblance to Krafwerk...), abusive cops, mute brats, a car that gradually becomes more and more disastrously wrecked and, of course, lots of bowling.
