The movie is quite short, but It still leaves you speechless, questioning your exsistence. Also, the finishing sentence: \"In case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night!\", portrays a moment of clarity and a chance of long-awaited freedom.  As always, Jim Carrey carried the role so effortlessly and powerfully and I would recommend everyone to watch this movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",

The Truman Show allows the viewer to explore the world at the same time as Truman, making it feel like they, too, are discovering the world's true reality. The experience of watching Jim Carrey's normal portrayal as a happy go lucky character grow into an emotionally captivating character with real human feelings of sadness, anxiety, sacredness and confusion, is so powerful. The casting of Truman could not have been better. All in all this movie is an absolute masterpiece of creativity and world building, and will be a worthwhile watch to anyone considering viewing this movie.",

This movie is very impactful to the point where it can allow you to evoke many feelings of sympathy, disturbance, happiness, and laughter.

I believe this is one of Jim Carrey's best performances in the film industry solely because he portrayed Truman very well. Although this film is hopeful, it saddens me that Truman's life was stolen from him for clout. Even the soundtrack does its job to support the movie and conveys Truman's life in a meaningful way.",

            "content": "Truman was presented with the blue pill and the red pill. \nThe blue is to preserve a decent middle-class life in the 90s, rotating around the office, friends, and family within an unpretentious peaceful town. The right pill is a ruthless rebellion, an impulsive subversion to the existing tranquility. It's to doubt the specious smoothness and legitimacy of his life and to investigate every obstruction he encountered when trying to pull away from the monotone and sail off for new places. It's to raise the disrupting question \"is my life set up for something\" and \"if everyone is in on it\", where \"it\" was later revealed to be a live TV show. \nIt took some convolution for Truman to figure out the reality, which is ironically a fiction where all his friends, fams, neighbors, and colleagues are the cast and all relationships are performed according to the script. The society around Truman is constructed and governed by the principle that his personality shall be kept safe as his body so that he stayed that humorous, outspoken, and relatable figure who's been favored by the audience. I wouldn't dispute the creator's assertion that \"there's no more truth out there than the world I created\" since in whatever world there are lies and conceits. But Truman should be free to confront them, to pierce through the disguise instead of hiding from it, and indeed he insisted on his right to discover and embrace the reality, even if it might be less graceful.\nOne peculiar point that's worth more discussions and even speculations (since we are not provided with many clues directly from the movie) is what's on Truman's mind. When he realized himself in a modern utopian world with an ordinary sweet and sour life where he couldn't tell the line between the real and the fake. How much tacit understanding does he share with Maron(his best friend since childhood)? How much does Meryl love him? How many people listened and replied and how many just read out the script? These questions could devastate one's faith since it put emotions and human connections at stake. I guess Truman had episodes of fear and despair, even hesitation to stay in the bubble. But in the end, he put on his common positivity, \na determination rather than simplemindedness, to defeat the storm and\nhead out to the exit, a channel to a wider and wilder world.",

It's as simple as that.\"  Totally original in nature, the film succeeds on the strength of its story, countless thought-provoking insights, and what is probably Carrey's strongest and most memorable performance.

But in fact, everyone is living in a set world, we live in this society, but also subject to all kinds of invisible constraints and restrictions. But can we deny that this world is not real?

Other people have even caught common TV practices being used maliciously, such as the fact that the year on the magazines Truman receives from the stand are always a few years late to the newspapers and magazines the viewers have, a common practice in TV today due to the fact that it is difficult to produce episodes in response to an event on the spot, which means if something serious happened outside the dome, he wouldn't know anything about it for years, just so they could get that \"perfect reaction.\"\n\nAll of this was rolled up into a comedy film. If you're here for the laughs, this will probably not be for you, to be honest.

After watching the film, I have nothing but praise for this film. The Truman Show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. Beautifully scripted by Andrew Niccol and flawlessly directed by Weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. Here Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the star of the world's most popular reality show. The catch is he doesn't know that. Truman believes he lives in Seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. This realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again I find Weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. Aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. Having loved his performances in Liar Liar and The Mask, I was looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in parts(in a subtle way in alternative to hysterical) is very sympathetic and moving. Ed Harris is great as Christoff and Laura Linney is outstanding as Meryl. Overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

While it isn't marginally better than Jaws since I have them both in my top 100 and I rated them both 5/5 stars on here, I still prefer it over the shark adventure.  This film also broke a record for me of not legitimately laughing in a movie in a long while.  During my watch of True Lies I chuckled a little bit, but during The Truman Show (even though it is more of a drama than a comedy) I full on belly laughed a couple of times which added to the overall experience.

After watching the film, I have nothing but praise for this film. The Truman Show is a truly dazzling and sophisticated satirical comedy drama on media omnipotence that benefits from fine direction and performances. Beautifully scripted by Andrew Niccol and flawlessly directed by Weir, the film is utterly captivating from the start right through to the truly poignant finale. Here Carrey plays Truman Burbank, the star of the world's most popular reality show. The catch is he doesn't know that. Truman believes he lives in Seahaven an island community that is somewhat idyllic, but in reality it is just a set housed in a studio with his friends and family as actors. This realisation and how it comes across is ambitious admittedly, then again I find Weir a fairly ambitious director, but it comes across as brilliant. Aside from the directing, concept and script, the acting really does soar here. Having loved his performances in Liar Liar and The Mask, I was looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey in a more dramatic role, and his restrained performance while funny in parts(in a subtle way in alternative to hysterical) is very sympathetic and moving. Ed Harris is great as Christoff and Laura Linney is outstanding as Meryl. Overall, brilliant film, it is funny but poignant too. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I think Carrey is at his best when he doesn't try to fool you into thinking he's not a funny dude. He does some real, pure dramatic roles after this one that are just nowhere near as good; it's like he wanted to prove that he can still act with his hands tied behind his back, and he's right, but it's still not as entertaining as watching him in peak form like this.

Saw on Netflix so thought I'd give it a rewatch.\n\nI was really blown away by how relevant this film continues to be over the years. The explosion of reality TV took hold in the early 2000s with shows such as Big Brother enrapturing people across the globe. The voyeurism of watching real people live their lives and interact with others provides so much more authenticity than what actors can achieve through playing characters. In a way it gives us a sense of escapism. Indeed, throughout the film we see multiple cutaways to various characters who seem to spend their whole lives watching Truman live his rather than face their own.\n\nThe film also provides commentary on the way media has the ability to influence and change the way we view and interact with the world. This is especially pertinent in a world now dominated with 'fake news' and conspiracy theories becoming accepted within a more mainstream setting thanks to the proliferation of disinformation online. I think Ed Harris' character Christof summed it up best with this quote: \"We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented\".\n\nFinally, with the advent and development of social media and how it has come to dominate our lives (Letterboxd being one of them), we all belong and star in our own Truman shows. We share ourselves, often in intimate detail with the whole world free to scrutinise our lives.\n\nTo summarise, I remembered this as just another solid Jim Carrey film from the 90s, but on rewatch discovered an absolute gem of a film.",

The execution of the isolated man is something that is unique to this film. The withholding of information, first informs the viewers, and then gives our root able protagonist something to fight for, as well as a shock he hasn't felt before. Jim Carrey's acting in this film is some of his best work, and the end is befitting of his depiction of one man against the world. The satirical projection of hollywood consumerism and production is better than most, with advertising being both comical and realistic.

            "content": "It was boring when I saw it during release, it's boring now. The movie was basically a big satire of reality TV, hence why the premise is more unrealistic. It requires human behavior and logistics that are akin to something like Running Man and Deathrace 2000. The movie at the time was marketed that way, no one implied any deep meanings or themes, it was sold as \"Look how stupid reality TV is and if we lived that way to an extreme.\" Ok, possibility for amusement.\n\nThen a 99 minute movie felt like 35 minutes to me. People discuss figuring out the premise, but there's nothing to figure out. You get an exposition dump in the beginning of the movie to explain everything neat and tidy. You know where Truman stands, and if you know anything about the film previous to walking into the theater you know the theme to the movie is his inevitable realization of his surroundings. It takes no times at all for average intelligence viewers to conclude where the movie is heading: His escape. Love or hate this film, you likely guessed the ending by no later than the 15 minute mark.\n\nNow I'm not trying to brag but I was a nerd about film even as a teen and had seen enough movies to understand basic writing framework. Not some prodigy, just basic understanding.\n\nSo I watch the character have a call to adventure (his realization of his surroundings), The activist helps him (help), He ends up going through his threshold (Concludes it's time to challenge the status quo), and then makes the journey to escape (Challenges and trials). Finally, he escapes the dome (The Rebirth).\n\nWhere the F*** is the other half of the arc? The movie is HALF a hero's journey. So while there's some hijinks and interactions, ultimately we're watching the first 2 or 3 acts of a 5 act structure. Now some might debate that his wife leaving and his fake dad showing up are the death and rebirth, but I felt as though the new wife, his old wife and the dad were not played to a significant enough extent to portray that. They feel like trials in and of themselves.\n\nThis is a major reason I didn't enjoy the movie. It's half a story. I could come up with so many ideas to the how's and what if's of this world, and after my imagination went wild, I was left with \"He got out. The end.\" The only other movie that felt so pointless to me was Perfect Storm.\n\nI also can't give this movie credit the same way others do for it's \"accurate satire\" and \"deeper meanings\" Look kiddies, these movies pre internet had advertising too. We had interviews back then too. All the same promotional material, you just watched it on E! instead of Youtube. And no, this movie was outright sold as satire of a specific thing. Comparing it to Twitch streamers seems like apples and oranges to me. The concept of \"you're being watched\" had been done to death by 1985.\n\nI get that often in society, liking things seems to be based more on what's trendy, but still, I relate to other viewers in the mind boggle you experience trying to figure out WTF everyone else saw in this POS.",

How would a man unwittingly be in his own reality TV show all his life without realising. Nobody would believe it in todays cinema. That's what makes this film so brilliant. I genuinely as a kid remember watching it and losing my mind trying to work out if my life was a reality TV show. Every mirror and strange occurrence made me wonder for a good while after the film. Not many films can affect you like that but that's what this film did. It really made me wonder as a kid. That's really something that you want from a movie. To make you think about it after  you watch it. Even now it is still a clever movie. \n\nI always think imagine if this was a real thing. Could you actually picture a whole town in a massive dome that is made specifically for one clueless person who doesn't realise anything is real around him. Just imagine watching that show on TV. You would have none of that fake shit you get on every reality show. Yeah the cast would be actors but one man just not having a clue he's the star of a show and he's being watched. We would have a real reality show which would actually be worth watching. Thing is that's majorly unethical and seriously fucked up, so we will never see something like that. Instead we see it in this film and it's quite the experience. \n\nTruman Burbank is a really likeable character. Jim Carrey makes him that way. This for me is his greatest ever role. He really blends bits of comedy with seriousness and we get to see the perfect all around character. Carrey will never star in a role this good again. As an audience we are majorly caught up in his story. We want him to have his happy ending and for him to find out his world isn't as he seems. We're invested. The film is brilliance and Carrey's performance is the draw in that brilliance. One of my favourite parts of the film is how he just starts noticing all the little details in his life and starts to come to this realisation something isn't right. How would you react if all those things started happening in your life?! I would literally have no clue what to do. \n\nYou add a unique and still to this day not replicated premise with a actor at his absolute best in Carrey and a really good cast around him. As an audience we want a film to leave us thinking afterwards and the Truman Show is one of those movies even now 22 years later that leaves us fascinated. It truly is one of the most clever films I've ever seen. Even now after all these years it is a brilliant rewatch and easily a must see film!  \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

(Source: IMDB)\n\nThe Truman show is a movie that you will enjoy from beginning to an end, the movie will break the boredom in a clever way that will seem to be simple and that's a thing that I have seen in very few movies. \n\nJim Carrey as Truman Burbank was perfect, amazing performance and he was able to present that character exactly the way it should be presented, would not call this his best performance tho, in my opinion, Jim Carrey's best performance is \"Joel Barish\" in \"Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind\", that's why I don't agree with those who say \"The Truman Show\" is his best movie. \nEd Harris' performance was Oscar-worthy, and of course, the entire support cast was amazing, very well done. \n\nThe Truman Show's amazing production design, music, and cinematography that looks exactly like a reality TV show, it's like you are thrown in there with Truman Burbank. \n\nThe custom designs that were incredible and a thing that really grabbed my attention, for example, the cool black custom of Christof (played by Ed Harris) with the hat, or Lauren Garland's (played by Natascha McElhone) cool red custom with a shirt that has red flowers on it that she was wearing when her and Truman Burbank talked at the library, or Truman Burbank's suit, they were all so simple but looked amazing. \n\nThe Truman show is a movie that everyone will enjoy and one of the most original movies ever made, it has drama, comedy, great score, character development, great story, superb production design, and many more things, highly recommend this to everyone.",

There's also a big problem with the story since it seems very unlikely that Truman wouldn't realise the reality of the situation earlier, especially when the studio did such a poor job of hiding things. It's not really funny and some of the dialogue could have been better. The acting is decent but certain characters seemed completely fake throughout like Truman's wife and it makes no sense how he never noticed. Overall, the plot is reasonable, and gradually revealing more and more about who Truman really was as well as the switch to the sort of producer/director perspective at the end worked well. However, things are too weird and silly throughout and that negatively affects the believability.",

Acredito que o filme demora um pouco para \"decolar\", mas  a partir da metade se passa muito rápido. Creio que ele tenha acabado no momento correto, e cabe a nós imaginar o que havia por vir. O diretor escolheu uma abordagem mais caricata, visto que algo \"pé no chão\" mudaria muito a atmosfera do filme e como os personagens reagiriam ao longo dele. Visto que a obra não se leva a serio, nossa tolerância aumenta e a realidade ali posposta tende a ser menos depressiva e pessimista.\n\nThe Truman Show é engraçado, traz umas reflexões interessantes sobre o tema e tem um final assertivo com um clímax bem definido.",

Truman Burbank's death is presented through his world shattering realization that he lived in a legitimate bubble his entire life. Not only had he been completely isolated from the outside world to a manufactured society that manipulated his behaviors and upbringing, but the outside world had complete surveillance of ever moment of his life for 30 years. It seems obvious that prescription medication and years of psychological therapy would be essential for Truman to cope with this depressing recognition, however, director Peter Weir spares us of this tragedy by ending the film and fulfilling the archetype with a heroic rebirth of Truman Burbank as he triumphed over the director and antagonist by stepping out of the fabricated reality into the real world he had yet to know. \n\nThe conflict of the film presented itself from the start as a stage life came plummeting from the sky onto the streets of the unsuspecting truman. The plot was thick with backstory on Truman's birth, childhood and loss of his father, however, the only plot point to truly drive the story and capture the viewers attention was a flashback encounter with an old flame who leaked the truth that Truman was on a show and his whole life was a lie manipulated by actors and directors. Truman begins to gain awareness of his captivity through a lull of persistent obstacles, diversions undertaken by actors and a series of special effects created the director to keep him from leaving. While the audience is directed to route for Truman to escape in this story of captivity and injustice, the core of our desire for Truman to make it out of his manipulated bubble is due to an inner desire we have as people to seek the truth. \n\nWe wanted Truman to beat the odds and have an opportunity to live a real life like ours. But moreover we wanted Truman to gain clarity of the misconceptions surrounding the world he had been presented. The overall social commentary of the film is that media outlets and large corporations presents us with misleading information and biased opinions then present these as facts to the world. We are living in our own bubble like Truman, and these influential corporations and media outlets control our own truths we believe in our lives.",

Since his birth, Truman's life in the idealistic town of Seahaven was broadcasted for years 24/7 on televisions across the entire globe. \n\nIn this 1998 film from Paramount Pictures directed by Peter Weir, Jim Carrey plays the happy-go-lucky protagonist, Truman Burbank. The film begins with Truman working as an insurance salesman and facing the trials of everyday life while otherwise living in a seemingly perfect town. As the film progresses, Truman begins to question the authenticity of his own reality and relationships. This film uses foreshadowing effectively to hint at the false nature of Truman's world. Truman's adventuristic spirit and desire to see parts of the world beyond Seahaven forces the show's creator and mastermind, Christof, to take extreme measures in an attempt to keep Truman in Seahaven. \n\nPeter Weir's portrayal of Christof as an omniscient creator who is able to alter and fabricate the entire reality of a human being points toward the film's social commentary on free will. This film creates a dialogue regarding to what degree humans have in controlling their own destiny. In an age plagued by commercialization and media, it seems as if intervention by higher powers are constantly in play. This film effectively uses placed product advertising as a thread to comment on how commercialized our world is today. \n\nChristof's belief that Seahaven is a paradise free from the toxins of normal human life raises an interesting argument about morality. Is lacking free will a price worth paying for a life free from normal human struggles and pain? The wide viewing audience of The Truman Show in the film also provides a social commentary about the role of media and television in modern life. It seems that reality television has only become more popular since this film's release and the comparison to lives portrayed as perfect on cameras has become more dangerous. \n\nThis film also provides a social commentary about what a \"perfect life\" constitutes. Despite having a beautiful wife, stable job, and financial stability, Truman still is left with a sense of longing. In Seahaven, a perfect life is portrayed as a middle-class nuclear family. Truman's unhappiness with his life in Seahaven questions societal norms.  \n\nUltimately, the resolution of the film occurs when Truman is forced to overcome his own internal conflicts to leave the comfort of his entire world known to him in Seahaven, and choose to step into the unknown outside world. Truman's character arch as the protagonist shows immense growth as he learns to overcome his fears and leaves his constructed reality behind. Truman embodies the Death and Rebirth film archetype as he leaves his entire life in Seahaven behind and steps through the door to the unknown.\n\nIn contrast to many other films in the drama/fantasy genre, The Truman Show utilizes an interesting plot, foreshadowing, and character development to effectively convey a greater social commentary. This film gets my endorsement of five stars!",

            "content": "The Truman show causes hearts to stir for Truman, a man who is being taken advantage of by a corporation.  However, it pushes the audience to think of what \"corporation\" is controlling their life.  This film serves as a \"call out\" to modern audiences in order to expose their willingness to be controlled by social media.\nTruman is the main character of a reality show that he doesn't even know exists.  Being controlled by a corporation, Truman is faced with planned tragedies and planted with fears in order to make the perfect, relatable character.  Truman falls in love with an extra who warns him about the reality show and is then removed by the corporation.  Truman starts picking up on signs that his surroundings are planned.  \nThe cinematography consists of continuous usage of a \"fish eye lens\" to allow the audience to foreshadow that Truman is being watched.  Until the storyline reveals Cristoff, the director and head of the Truman show, the audience is left to predict who exactly is watching Truman.  \nThe dialogue between people of the town and Truman serves as a thread to exhibit the awkwardness of the actors and portray a false society.  Not only does Truman's signature \"Good Morning\" phrase persist, but he continues to have scripted conversations that seem rather forced.  \nA biblical influence shadows over the film through the use of imagery and symbolism.  Cristoff serves as a \"God\" as he controls Truman's life in order to follow a greater plan.  Being adopted by the corporation, it only makes sense for Truman to be considered his son; therefore, Truman is the son of \"God\", or a Christ figure.  With the usage of heaven-like cinematography, such as the staircase to the set or \"heaven\", and Truman \"sacrificing\" himself for the happiness of others, such as his viewers, Truman is portrayed as a Jesus who has risen.  Thus, the archetypal \"Death and Rebirth\" story is developed as Truman's oblivious nature to the TV set is eradicated and he is reborn as a man who is taking control over his own life. \nI give this film 5/5 stars for the effectiveness of its social commentary. This film provides a social commentary that exposes the obliviousness of the audience to social corruption, which differs from other films that follow the \"Death and Rebirth\" archetype which aims to inspire the common man.  This film leaves the audience feeling skeptical about their own lives and the influences which control their actions.",

            "content": "The Truman Show.\n\nThis is a classic tale of death and rebirth. The rebirth is the sudden self-actualization that comes with Truman's change of perception. Moreover, death can be construed as walking out of the life that he always knew, and adventuring into the world that is unknown to Truman.\nBeyond the character archetype of death and rebirth, we find that the film hints at another piece of social commentary, the blurring of the public and private sphere. Truman is publicly displayed for the voyeuristic pleasure of an audience while the audience maintains its own autonomy. A strange dynamic that we can all relate to in this age of technological change.\nWe see how Truman is part of a mass surveillance scheme that fetishizes his life and portrays him to the world as an object. To the audience, Truman is not a human, he is an object of consumption. The audience lives through Truman and has a strange affection for him, but disregards his current situation. You can find similarities between Truman and zoo animals. A fake environment, scripted interactions, lighting, sound, and worst of all is the inability to live out life as nature intended. \nAnother archetype that can be drawn from The Truman Show is the True Love Story. In several instances, we see how Truman is determined to find the girl that he was in love with in High School. You could argue that the entire movie is based around the plot of Truman trying to escape this fake world in order to find the girl that he is in love with, but is unable to leave because of his situation. \nOverall, The Truman Show was not a great example of Jim Carrey's acting range. The plot was interesting and kept me focused on the screen, but the ending left a little more to be desired.",

This film shows of how easy it is to manipulate the human mind, tricking and melding ideas into something that is suitable for whoever is in charge. In this case, the director in order to turn a profit and provide entertainment for the public. One of the biggest criticisms that I have for this film is that even though the audience knows what is happening around Truman and the set up of the show, many of the background characters make it painfully obvious that they are setting up a \"show\" within the movie and it kinda made me wonder how Truman never questioned anything in the timeframe before the movie; however, it is tolerable because at the end of the day the film is still a comedic drama. Overall, I absolutely love this movie and I would give it an 8/10.",

            "content": "Conceptually this film is not unique as there are many other films that follow the same storyline including EDtv (1999) which was released just a year later but this is a film that uses that base outline to comment on religion, the negative influence of media and the toll that television takes on it's stars. The steady hands of Peter Weir carry the film along as he brings a touch of humanity to the film that is necessary while never losing sight of the larger points that the film wants to make. I found myself enjoying the film even as I was made uncomfortable by how perceptively the film is able to attack our modern media culture.\n\nAs a baby Truman Burbank, Jim Carrey, was legally adopted by a corporation and has become the star of a reality television show that has documented him from childhood and follows him 24 hours a day without his being aware. He does not love his wife Meryl, Laura Linney, and yearns to run away and reunite with Lauren Garland, Natascha McElhone, who he genuinely fell in love with. He does not know that the actress playing Garland had wanted to reveal the reality television show to Burbank but had been banished by tyrannical producer Christof, Ed Harris, before she could inform him. He eventually discovers his reality and tries to test those around him in an attempt to break free but faces great adversity with resources being thrown at him by the producers. Viewers who have tuned in to watch him their entire lives are shocked as the show begins to break down with Burbank noticing his wife's product placement and moving out of his usual routine. He is able to escape one night but Christof forces him to question whether he really wants to leave the home he has inhabited for so long but he asserts his desire to be an individual.\n\nIt was a surprise to some audiences in 1998 to discover the twist in this film as they probably expected a broad Jim Carrey comedy reliant on slapstick instead of a funny but introspective film about an optimistic but lonely man. Watching the film now, already knowing the twist, you can see how the breadcrumbs are laid out so that you get the sense that something is off. The big reveal to the audience is not cheap as twists often are but occurs relatively early in the film and provides an opportunity to explore how gross and manipulative the normalcy of Burbank's situation is. When we see the people who Burbank cares the most about as actors exploiting him or their own selfish gain who casually describe the ways in which they manipulate him and use him for their own gain. The scariest character in the film is Christof who is reminiscent of one of the characters from Network (1976) and seems to have no life outside of keeping Burbank under control. We fear for him even as we see the comedy in the constructed life he lives and the eerie parallels to the entertainment we consume as it grows more and more depraved.\n\nCarrey's performance was widely acclaimed although it failed to garner him an Academy Award nomination and it is fascinating to see him put his comedic abilities to use while managing to handle the serious elements of the film as well. He is relentlessly cheerful and has clearly studied the work of a Dick van Dyke or an Andy Griffith to get the style of a sitcom from this era. His more toned down, emotionally volatile moments are affecting as they are vanity free with Burbank seeming like an upset child rather than the angered but powerful figure a different actor may have played him as. Linney gives a typically fantastic supporting performance as his slimy wife shifting expertly between the Donna Reed role her character plays on the reality show and the calculating actress she plays off screen. Harris and his intense blue eyes are put to good use as the godlike Christof and he does have a manic intensity that convinces you of the psychopathic nature of the character. \n\nYou buy in completely to the film's concept and are uplifted when we see the man who has been taken advantage of his whole life break away.",

Eventhough I didn't pay much attention at first to this movie I realize that it is worth watching it.  I'm just disappointed on how it ends but it's all worth it. I'll recommend this movie to everyone. It's a nice movie.",
