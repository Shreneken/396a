    "summary": "Having just returned from a mission to Mars, Commander Ross (Justin Lazard) isn't exactly himself. He's slowly becoming a terrifying alien entity with one goal -- to procreate with human women! When countless women suffer gruesome deaths after bearing half-alien offspring, scientist Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) and hired assassin Press Lennox (Michael Madsen) use Eve (Natasha Henstridge), a more tempered alien clone, to find Ross and his brood. Before long Eve escapes to mate with Ross.",

Michael Madsen delivers his usual lacklustre performance, throatily mumbling his way through the expletive filled lines, women explode with rubber monster aliens and my eyes rolled up inside my head so many times they got stuck there. If there were just one redeeming aspect of this film I could be less harsh, but it has nothing going for it - bad actors delivering crummy dialogue, terrible monster effects, an awful musical score, clunky looking technology ... even the hair and make up are terrible!

            "content": "Rating: 1 / 5\nSo Bad it's good rating: 2,5 / 5\n\nThe First \"Species\" was a B-Horror film that was mostly an excuse to have Natasha Henstridge take off her clothes as often as possible, \"Species 2\" is even worse, often makes little sense. The one positive thing you can say is that does stay consistently entertaining. If you can't remember the plot of the first movie, here's what you need to know. Scientists received a transmission from outer space telling them how to splice human and alien DNA together. The resulting creature, a sexy lady with an incredible healing factor and superhuman strength had one goal in mind: breed and have her children replace humanity as the dominant. The creature managed to escape, kill a bunch of people and seduce more than a few lucky guys but her luck ran out when an under-qualified team of scientists managed to track her down and incinerate her. The movie ended with a cliffhanger, a deadly alien-rat hybrid managed to escape! Two years later, that rat died off or decided to take a vacation or something because we never see it again. Instead we tune in to witness man's first steps on Mars. A sample from the red planet contains an unseen threat though, living alien DNA! It merges with the three astronauts on board of the shuttle without their knowledge. The mission safely lands back on Earth but the head astronaut begins acting strangely. Once out of his father's sight (James Cromwell plays Senator Ross), Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard) has sex with two women (sisters who share everything) and they immediately give birth to more rapidly-growing human-alien hybrids. It's like the first movie, but this time it's a guy going around seducing and impregnating women with his alien DNA. It's time to call in the experts who survived the last movie to track down this menace. They are assisted by a clone of the creature from the first movie who shares a psychic link with Patrick. With the rapidly-growing spawns of the creature, a PR nightmare waiting to happen and a growing connection between the two hybrids, there's plenty on our heroes' plate so does humanity stand a chance against this new species?\n\nWhere do I begin with this movie? Obviously the appeal of the first movie was that it was kind of a worst-nightmare scenario for guys horror/thriller. There's a reason that sexy lady is interested in you buster, it's because she wants to give birth to the death of mankind! Use a condom, Earth could depend on it! You get the idea. It was bad, but it had some fun moments. This time, it's a male alien so the stakes are higher up. Not only is he able to go around impregnating woman after woman, but if you give birth to one of these hybrids, you're dead. On the upside, this means that if you thought seeing a naked woman was nice, but you got tired of seeing the same pair of breasts over and over, this time we get a whole parade of different women. The downside is that we get one awkward rape attempt and a plot that really makes no sense at times. So this astronaut that's going around seducing women left and right, but he's a famous astronaut; the first man on Mars. We even see that he's got his face plastered all over children's cereal! Why do people only recognize him when it's convenient to the plot? Why don't they tell the police and the civilian populace to keep an eye out for him? We're told that it's because it would be a public relations nightmare, but come on, wouldn't the fact that he leaves behind a trail of disemboweled women kind of require at least a police investigation or a press conference? When the entire population of the world is at stake, does it really matter what the reputation of one possessed man means?\n\nAs a sequel to the first film, this one isn't really that consistent with the previously established mythology. During the conclusion of \"Species\", Syl gave birth to a son, pretty much the same way a human would.  This time though, whenever somebody gives birth, it's a real horror show! Tentacles start grabbing people's faces, women's stomachs are exploding, there's blood everywhere... no one's safe! It's hard to tell if some of the events are intentionally nonsensical or just errors. Like a scene where some of Ross' blood grows a mind of its own and kills a scientist. It appears to crawl inside the wall and create a tentacle capable of punching through a grown adult's chest in the matter of seconds... and yet no one manages to be able to connect the dead body and the blood sample he was studying as a cause for these events. I'm pretty sure that beaker was labeled and you would be able to read what was marked on it even though it fell to the ground and shattered. Like in the previous film, the ridiculously important mission gets trusted to just a couple of guys. There's a scene where a helicopter is in pursuit of a hybrid. This is complete panic; this could be the one chance to nail the creature! Somehow though, it reaches its hideout and our heroes, who are driving arrive there long before anyone else... including the helicopter!\n\nThere are some cool special effects, particularly when we see the aliens in their natural forms but other times, it's really amateurish. There's a scene where Eve, the new female hybrid is being shot at by soldiers. She falls down, all bloody. Blood starts to leak out of her wounds when suddenly, it starts going back inside her again as she recovers from her injuries. Thanks to her alien powers she gets back up but her clothes are no longer bloody. That's because the footage of her healing is the same footage we saw a second ago, played backwards! What a joke. Next shot, her clothes are bloody again, but no bullet holes. It's embarrassing to watch. Here's another bad scene: Ross has grabbed a woman at the supermarket for the purposes of sex. Apparently his alien brain is really stupid because she was flirting with him right before he forcibly grabbed her and she started screaming. He obviously has a lot of charisma because he's been able to pick up ladies left and right up to now but this time, he's got no time to wait. Unfortunately for the victim, no one in the supermarket or the parking lot is paying attention and tries to intervene. There's hope though because our heroes are right behind them. We see the creature throw the nice lady into the back of a black van (this is the awkward rape attempt I was talking about). Our heroes walk into the parking lot and they see an identical black van rocking and when they open the door, what do they see? A normal human couple trying to get it on. You're telling me there was an identical black van, with another couple attempting to have sex in the exact same parking lot? Give me a break.\n\nThe first movie you can enjoy as a sleazy guilty pleasure but \"Species 2\" is just a bad science fiction horror film. It's not particularly scary or sexy and is often downright ridiculous. It's so bad it made me rethink my affections for the first film. Just skip this one.

            "content": "Within the brief time in Species 2 where the space shuttle appears and has a logo for Pepsi Lite, people gathered to bask in the badness of Species 2. The plot is a lot wider than in the first species, but the screenplay is very weak and full of stereotypical dialogue, as well as racially stereotypical dialogue for Mykelti Williamson's character. \nA lot of the main cast are commonly overacting as well, with the exception being Michael Madsen who doesn't even appear until 28 minutes in. His performance was ok, except as we learned from Species, he cant deliver one-liners. But he gave a good enough performance, as did Mykelti Williamson and Peter Boyle, but none of them drew any strength from the screenplay.\nNatasha Henstridge is given little dialogue or chances to prove herself as an actress or even an alien, and she was ok in some parts and her facial gestures gave her some strength, but since she didn't take her clothes off much then she didn't really provide a character that had much importance in the film. I guess you can't blame her though, because then she doesn't have to be second best to her breasts for the duration of the film like in Species.\nSpecies also has poor editing and bad lighting, so in the climactic alien sex scene it seems that nobody knows what's going on. There's also moments unexplained, like why Madsen had to stab Williamson in the leg with a pitchfork and use his blood to kill the alien.\nThere's also tedious use of slow motion at the more impacting scenes and the climax is over way too quickly, so Species 2 doesn't run for too long but could have used a few more minutes of action\n\nHowever, it is much less repetitive than it's predecessor and does introduce some decent new ideas to the series. It also has good, albeit occasionally weak cinematography and a strong musical score. \nSpecies 2 also utilises a good amount of gore and nudity as it knows that it's what the audience is hoping for. There was also some decent visual effects.\n\nSo in the end, Species 2 exceeds the expectations set by Species and i feel it's an improvement, but it isn't hard to improve over Species, so there's little to get excited about.",

This is an impressive sequel that though is far from perfect, has enough momentum to entertain the viewer. This film has enough gore elements to overshadow the paper thin plot, and works. The film is pure popcorn sci fi horror, and though not memorable by any means, this film, this film is nonetheless a worthy film to watch compared to the final two sequels that would follow this film. The acting here is decent at best, nothing ever great, or remarkable. The plot is so-so, and doesn't do anything to blow you away. However what this sequel does is deliver good gore content, and it does it very well. The film plays out like a mindless sci fi horror action film, and it doesn't possess anything truly remarkable about it. Overall this is a fun film that should appeal to fans of alien, monster films. If you can excuse the paper thin plot, you'll most likely enjoy the film. Fans of the first film will most likely enjoy this one as much as the first.

As the one astronaut rapidly mates with all the hookers he can find, a team, similar to the one assigned to the previous hunt (including Michael Madsen of course), is sent after him before his breeders can further develop into adults.

            "content": "SPECIES 2[1997]: It's a sure fact in Hollywood that 60% of all Sequels are never as good as the original. However only 40% of all sequels are often on par if not better than their predecessors and those films are the likes of THE GODFATHER PART 2, THE DARK KNIGHT, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, TERMINATOR 2 and ALIENS. But those films are a few examples of GOOD sequels, if you want an example a dirt average sequel that was spawned off the back of an otherwise average film then look no tougher than SPECIES 2. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut don't take my bias word for it here is an extract from the 2004 interview for the UK website METRO by the film's star Michael Madsen.\r\n\r\n \r\n\"METRO: On your website you rate your own films, and have some negative things to say about lots of them - including SPECIES 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASDEN: That's because SPECIES 2 was a crock of shit. There are a number I'm not very proud of. The movie studios can't mind that much, as they haven't contacted me to tell me off about it. I'm honest - if I've made a bad movie, I want my fans to know what they're letting themselves in for.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETRO: You're quoted as saying you've only made five good movies in your career. True?\r\n\r\n\r\nMASDEN: Pretty much. It's certainly less than ten. KILL BILL, SPECIES, FREE WILLY, THELMA AND LOUISE, RESERVOIR DOGS and DONNY BRASCO. Six, that's it, that's not a low number. I'm just hard to please. I've made some crap but you've got to pay the bills.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/1020-michael-madsen#ixzz1LtlGI68M\r\n\r\nThat's right Madsen views SPECIES 2 as \"a crock of shit\" wow how many stars would be that honest? Well then again John Wayne regretted his 1956 dud THE CONQUEROR for being well just bad. So after viewing that average fest of the first SPECIES film let's dive right into the film that the critics, RT and Michael Madsen loathe and MGM doesn't care about it (like most of the trash in their vaults from AIP) the wonderful SPECIES 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAY 2 SPECIES 2 [1997]: After the first film in this four day marathon review series of series I now come to the second film and the last theatrical release film in the SPECIES series. And judging by my rating it's quite clear I didn't enjoy this film right dear reader? Yeah kind of, sure a rating of 50% indicates I found the film to be well not that good. Sure the first film isn't anything special but at least there wasn't such a serious undertone to that unlike this film trying to take the whole idea that a 2-demisonal nymphomaniac driven alien-woman IS something serious. The first film seemed a piece of B-grade sleazy Sic-Fi fun but SPECIES 2 takes itself and its material WAY too seriously in a half-assed Melodramatic way. It's no wonder why Madsen hates this movie so much. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut for what it's worth SPECIES 2 recycles the same lurid plotline with more absurd stuff and blended together with double amounts of female nudity, sex, and gore. But is it enjoyable as the first film? God no it's a step down which can describe the pre -mentioned 60% of all Movie Sequels. The reason why I find this film to be well a step down is due to the serious attitude of the film and its slightly annoying nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Astronaut Patrick Ross and his crew mates Dennis and Anna have a successful voyage to Mars take samples of the Martian soil. But on the way home a gooey substance (sadly not THE BLOB) leaks out of the containers and attaches on the crew. Back on Earth Patrick Ross is hailed as a hero and since he is part Alien now mindless sex with women that explode after being impregnated ensures. Now with one of the crew of the Mars mission staring up a new Alien species, the military now called upon the help of a caged female clone of Sil called Eve( played by Natasha Henstridge), her Doctor and again called upon Press Lenox (Madsen) to track down Ross. But when the Doctor awakens the alien cells in Eve she now escapes from the lab and now wants to have freaky Alien sex with Ross. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, SCRIPTING, DIRECTION, AND CINEMA PHOTOGRAPHY \r\n\r\nWhat can I say about the performances in this film? Natasha Henstridge as Eve unlike her previous performance as the 2D Sil is given emotions to try and display in this role. The character of Eve is written to be a tiny bit more 3-demisnonal considering her imprisonment and growing weary of viewing the world through the T.V. But thanks to Henstridge painfully wooden acting and this films over the top seriousness her acting comes across as flat as a flat soft-drink. Madsen who in hindsight dearly regrets being involved in this sequel is one of the saving graces as a repeat performance as Press Lenox but hang on isn't his name Preston? A bit of a continuity laps don't you think? Let's just say Madsen is ok in an otherwise lame film. But one of the more comical minor characters is the insane doctor played by the EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND stars Peter Boyle (who played Ray's father Frank) gives an over the top performance. For me the sign of a good acting is one actor or actress who could throw themselves into their role but here it becomes comical that Boyle when over the top with such a lame role. In fact seeing more of his bizarre character might have been a bit more enjoyable than the odd mix of the soft-core sex scenes with the sudden gore scenes.\r\n\r\n \r\nAs far as the scripting goes it just seems tacky thrown with this film's director obsession to makes a silly film seem WAY too serious. Although the first film was guilty of doing that at least it didn't go overboard with shitty melodrama unlike this film. And more irritating is how stereotypical the black character is, first we see the character of Dennis on the Mars mission  coming across as a serious person but back on earth he becomes the source of the comical relief by wanting to get laid in a typical look-he's-black-funny-and-cool -Wayans Brother manner. The rest like the cinema photography is well uninspired so to cut a LONG story short that's all I can say with the highly forgettable SPECIES 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall Thoughts\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short I hated it, sure it was mildly amusing but with this films serious nature and god awful characterization of this films Black hero is just near irritating.  So why not give a rating lower 50%? Well after seeing utter schlock like THE SEX KILLER, WOODCHIPPER MASSACRE, MONSTER A GO-GO and SANTA AND THE ICE CREAM BUNNY  just to name but a few. My standards for a BAD movie are VERY low. To me this film is a below average Sic-Fi sequel that blends elements of various Sic-Fi films both good and bad in one lame package that even the film's star hates it so. Then again if SPECIES 2 was lame how bad can SPECIES 3 be? Oh well two down and now two to go in this 4 day review marathon, the rating for SPECIES 2 is a weak 50%.",
