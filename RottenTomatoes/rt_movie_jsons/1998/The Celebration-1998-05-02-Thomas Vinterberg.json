It was a blast felt around the world, resonating in the form of accolades, awards, and an Oscar-winning film career for Vinterberg.  And The Celebration -- and by extension, Vinterberg and his excellent crew and bold cast (including Ulrich Thomsen, Henning Moritzen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Paprika Steen, and Gbatokai Dakinah) earns every bit of the massive acclaim it reaped.",

            "content": "\"It is quite a job being toastmaster tonight.\"\nWell that's an understatement.\n\nMost of the Dogme 95 'classics' (i.e., von Trier takes) do relatively little for me, they mostly seem to add a unique stylistic flair without justification, different for the sake of being different. But Festen is different; the shaky-cam and intimate angles play into the domestic instability, and actually impart an energy that helps place the audience at the table, stewing in the atmosphere of uncomfortable tension. And this Thomas Vinterberg film is one that relishes tension, playing off of the tightrope walk between social graces and honesty. The family is taken aback by explicit and unexpected accusations, and their first response is to ostracize the accuser despite the emotional authenticity of his pleas; the air in the room is quickly replaced by a shared, uneasy denial, almost surreal in nature. It takes several additional outbursts, including the testimony of an unquestionable source (from a candid suicide note) to ultimately force the truth onto the family, and even then breakfast returns to a cheery balance the following morning, with the notable exclusion of one now-reviled family member. Equal parts caustic, bleakly comic, and dramatically powerful, Festen is stripped-down but hard-hitting, a testament to the strength of a new aesthetic movement when paired with a narrative that actually complements it. (4.5/5)",

Hanging over the occasion is the recent suicide of Christian's twin sister, Linda.  Then, during the toasts at the dinner, Christian drops a bombshell.\n\nBrilliant drama from Danish director Thomas Vinterberg.  Immediately engrossing, with well-developed characters, each with their own unique peculiarities, and a high level of engagement.  Very interesting plot, with Christian's revelation kicking the intrigue up several notches.  It doesn't let up from then on out.\n\nClever camerawork from Vinterberg.  Many of the shots give a home-movie feel, heightening the candid, family atmosphere, and providing a touch of irony, considering how the plot develops.\n\nThe ending may feel anti-climactic but anything more would have been unnecessary and would just have diluted the brilliance of the movie.\n\nSolid performances all round, with Ulrich Thomsen, as Christian, the pick of the lot.\n\nThomas Vinterberg went on to direct two more masterpieces: Submarino (in 2010) and The Hunt (in 2012).  However, the first indication of his genius was here, Festen.",

            "content": "You haven't been to a dinner party from Hell until you've attended the festivities that surround Thomas Vinterberg's \"Festen\", a visceral drama with occurrences more nightmarish than anything you could ever imagine happening prior to a family event.  Most dread trivial reacquaintances, like getting stuck chatting with your aunt who peaked in high school, revisiting the cousins you never much got along with in the first place, or getting awkwardly kissed by elder relatives you couldn't admit the birthdays of if they asked.  It's not ideal to socialize with people you were born into socializing with - but it's much more enjoyable than the harrowing experience the Hansen family endures over a cold weekend in 1998, where the sixtieth birthday of patriarch Helge (Henning Moritzen) goes awry following a startling confession.\n\tThe get-together, held at the family-run hotel, is already a breeding ground of heavy tension: recently, eldest daughter Linda (Lene Laub Oksen) committed suicide in one of the building's several bathrooms.  Though her death is tragic, the family is past the mourning phase - the circumstances surrounding her demise are unknown to most, the majority of the family looking at it as a fatal bout of depression.\n\tBut Linda's twin brother, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), knows the truth.  Linda didn't kill herself because of ever-mounting stress or a particularly bad case of melancholy - she killed herself because of the sexual abuse she, along with Christian, endured as children at the hands of their father.  Being the eldest two kids, their younger siblings, Helene (Paprika Steen) and Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), know nothing of the abuse.  So when Christian's toast to his sister at dinner turns out to be a startling confrontation, the family, bourgeois and prosperous, is thrust into a long-winded state of denial, eventually transforming into civil turmoil.  \n\tFamously, \"Festen\" was the first film released under the short-lived reign of Dogme 95, a movement conceived by Vinterberg and Lars von Trier that was designed to take the most naturalistic aspects of filmmaking and put them in the place of the more conventional, costly characteristics of modern moviemaking.  Most noticeably, the era utilized handheld, digital cinematography, unnervingly realistic performances, and an unshakable feeling of voyeurism rather than passive entertainment.  In 2015, such practices are hardly revolutionary - by now, mumblecore and grittily minded horror movies have taken Dogme's place - but in the '90s, it was unheard of, save for the John Cassavetes pictures rarely watched by the mainstream.\n\t\"Festen\", along with von Trier's \"The Idiots\", are the best known films of the movement - and though \"The Idiots\" is still unseen by me, I can confidently say (as someone without much of an opinion regarding von Trier) \"Festen\" is the superior of the two, a feat of filmmaking that goes far beyond the gimmicky nature of Dogme itself and stands as an unshakable black comedy that progressively becomes a moving drama.\n\tIt begins with the same attitude we carry when attending family reunions, one of barely-there excitement soon eclipsed by decided anxiety.  Without the knowledge of what's to come, we can only laugh at the appalling behavior of Michael, who, upon his introduction, kicks his entire family out of the car to give the walking Christian a ride to the hotel, despite enough room.  We can smile at the way Helene's workaholic nature deteriorates as the family gathers and she is once again looked at as a child who, what do you know, grew up and became successful.  Even the uneasy relationships presented pass by with an uncomfortable chuckle - we've felt that very same tension, and a sort of relief washes over us as we realize that we don't have to partake in conversation ourselves.\n\tBut once Christian's toast at dinner turns the reunion into a revelatory exhibition of abuse, we, along with the invitees, don't know how to react.  Though we're disgusted by everyone's instantaneous denial (they all go back to eating as if nothing happened once the accused is spotlighted), part of us wonders if we'd do the same - would we ignore a bombshell just to continue on the cumbersome path we dreaded to embark on in the first place?\n\tWith its voyeuristic camerawork, fearless direction, and too-close-for-comfort performances, \"Festen\" asks us to at once emphasize and look at the scenery in horror.  It is painfully confessional and painstakingly well-conceived - the story, involving and often times funny, is well-suited for the rules of the Dogme.  Vinterberg's direction is so effortless it's not hard to come to the conclusion that everything we're seeing onscreen is spontaneous, completely in the moment; but when we leave the theater speechless, stunned, it's clear that the intended effect was not to execute a forgettable exercise in celluloid eccentricities but to take us on a journey far too disturbing, far too poignant, to ever lose sight of.  \n\tSome have questioned the tone - is it farcical or is it unflinchingly realistic? - but Vinterberg doesn't strive for either label.  It's a slice-of-life with too much crust, carrying an abundance of grit and not enough joy.  And yet, you can never take your eyes off the screen, either because the actors so perfectly embody Vinterberg's vision or because the cinematography, appearing in-the-moment at first glance, stunningly reflects the film's events.\n\tAs \"Festen\" closes, we're well aware that we'll never have an experience quite like it, and that Christian will never have a moment during his lifetime that won't be haunted by his past.  The final shot, a close-up of his thoughtful face, is shrouded in silence but says more than anything most films could ever dream of.  Despite the emptying of inner-demons, the unforgivable can never be forgotten; an emotional scar can never be lightened by an over-the-counter topical cream.",

The central idea is the gathering of relatives and friends for a father's sixtieth birthday of a moderate successful hotel resort located far away from the city- sort of like the hotel inn of \"The Shining\".  We had just learned that much of the characters had just come from a funeral of a sister who was living at the resort for we don't quite know in terms of it's circumstances until as the movie progresses. All I can say is that while watching this is like the hand held camera equivalent of Ingmar Bergman's \"Cries And Whispers\" since the revelations are shocking and demands some mature understanding.

Helge (Henning Moritzen) is a respected businessman and family patriarch, who is about to celebrate his 60th birthday. He's invited most of his family to celebrate the big day at a family run hotel in the Danish countryside. They include his wife Else (Birthe Neumann), his depressive eldest son Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), daughter Helene (Paprika Steen) and his volatile younger son Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen) But, Helge faces a major tragedy, his other daughter and Christian's twin Linda (Lene Laub Oksen) drowned herself in a bath at the hotel before the celebrations start, but Helge decides to keep this a secret from everyone at the party, knowing it would ruin everything. It's an unusual drama, dark if that, but it's amateurish nature seems to suit it. At times, making the viewer feel like a fly on the wall, looking in on these uncomfortable situations, but for a Dogme film, it's better than Lar Von Trier's The Idiots (1998)",

Ironically, it's sometimes relatively easy to mistake a deeply dramatic scene for a comedic one. This is a sharp and somehow disturbing tragicomedy that reveals the transformative power of truth, showing how a seemingly ordinary birthday party can change into an acute contest filled with accusations and revelations. After a rough and intense night no one is left unharmed, and the characters subconsciously know that even before they start to delve into the past.\n\nA cultivated and wealthy patriarch Helge (Henning Moritzen) is having a huge, luxurious 60th birthday party, and the whole family is invited. In the group there are three of his children: Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), a chronic and irascible boozer, Helene (Paprika Steen), an anxious and depressed anthropologist, and Christian (Henning Moritzen), a withdrawn and angry restaurateur, whose twin sister recently committed suicide, among other guests. Before the party even starts, the intimacy of the main characters is exposed, as they plunge deeper into the state of irrepressible existential angst with their peculiar pre-party 'preparations'. When the family gathers for a sit-down with the man of the night, a huge feasts begins and toasts are about to be made. As of then, nobody even expects that Christian is about the make a shocking Speech of Truth, one that will change the course of the whole evening, destroy the relations between the relatives, and ultimately cause a hell of a farce. By accusing his father of sexual abuse when he and his loving sister were little (additionally pointing out that his father is the true killer behind the sister's suicide), Christian only encourages others to expose their true feelings. What began as a celebration of one happy man's birthday turned into a violent, alcohol and hate-filled showcase of the most shocking kind. The gradual loss of innocence (though it's all right to assume that such a disturbing even took place before) is properly 'enriched' with a Dutch racist song, a few fights, a few bottles of wine, and a late-night dance that is supposed to smooth the whole repugnant situation. It's only surprising to observe as all the relatives eat breakfast the next morning in the exact same place, looking into each other's eyes without any apparent regret.\n\nIndisputably, The Celebration is Vinterberg's visionary approach to a family-in-shambles. As in every other Dogme 95 picture, the realism of the whole story is enhanced through on-location shooting, natural sounds, hand-held cameras, and no additional effects whatsoever. Even though it's hard no to laugh at times, the devastating power of this film is as harrowing as the main characters are cold-blooded and self-contained.",
