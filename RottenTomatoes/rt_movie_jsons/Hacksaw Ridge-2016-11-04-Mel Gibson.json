            "content": "\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a 2016 war/drama movie directed by Mel Gibson, based on the true story of Desmond Doss, a World War II medic who served during the Battle of Okinawa without ever carrying a weapon.\n\nOne of the strengths of this film is its powerful and emotional story. The movie follows Desmond Doss, a deeply religious man who is committed to serving his country but refuses to compromise his beliefs by carrying a weapon. Andrew Garfield delivers a strong performance as Doss, portraying his conviction and courage with sincerity and authenticity.\n\nThe movie's depiction of the Battle of Okinawa is harrowing and intense, with brutal and realistic depictions of combat that are not for the faint of heart. The cinematography is also impressive, with excellent use of light and shadow to create a sense of atmosphere and tension.\n\nThe film's direction by Mel Gibson is solid, with strong attention to detail and a willingness to depict the brutal reality of war. The musical score by Rupert Gregson-Williams is also a standout feature of the film, adding a sense of emotion and drama to the proceedings.\n\nHowever, one potential weakness of the film is its lack of nuance in its portrayal of the Japanese soldiers. While the movie doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality of war, it presents the Japanese soldiers as faceless and inhuman, without much insight into their motivations or perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a powerful and emotionally charged war/drama movie that is well worth watching. Its impressive performances, intense battle sequences, and strong direction make it a must-see for fans of the genre, although its lack of nuance in its portrayal of the enemy is worth noting.",

Ele, no geral, cont\u00e9m uma boa dire\u00e7\u00e3o e tem uma \"bonita\" fotografia com cenas de viol\u00eancia impressionantes  que mostram uma perspectiva bem real de uma guerra, no entanto, acaba pecando com algumas outras cenas. Essa obra vai faz\u00ea-lo questionar at\u00e9 onde o ser humano iria para defender suas convic\u00e7\u00f5es, onde, as perguntas: voc\u00ea arriscaria perder tudo aquilo que possui por elas? Incluindo sua pr\u00f3pria vida? permanecer\u00e3o na sua cabe\u00e7a durante todo o abra.\n\nA guerra \u00e9 um lugar que transforma homens em animais, corrompe o cora\u00e7\u00e3o de todos os soldados e a \u00fanica forma de sobreviv\u00eancia \u00e9 matando, essa \u00e9 ideia que muitos tem, mas n\u00e3o para Doss que consegue ir \u00e0 guerra apenas coma miss\u00e3o de salvar vidas, assim, o tema central da obra \u00e9 a segunda guerra mundial, tendo como personagem principal esse jovem objetor de consci\u00eancia. Nesse sentido, a obra come\u00e7a com foco na vida cotidiana de Doss, antes dele se alistar no ex\u00e9rcito, no qual \u00e9 apresentado o sonho do protagonista de ser m\u00e9dico e como seus princ\u00edpios s\u00e3o fortemente baseados na sua f\u00e9 crist\u00e3. \n\nDoss \u00e9 sujeito peculiar e muito interessante, ele \u00e9 sens\u00edvel, fisicamente fr\u00e1gil e extremamente fiel aos seus princ\u00edpios religiosos, no qual, chega a ser ir\u00f4nico pens\u00e1-lo como um soldado em uma guerra, principalmente indo por livre espont\u00e2nea vontade. Quando isso acontece a primeira coisa que vem em mente \u00e9 que ele ir\u00e1, ou desistir com muita facilidade ou mudar suas convic\u00e7\u00f5es por causa do ambiente hostil em que se encontrar\u00e1, mas \u00e9 um grande engano e sua moralidade \u00e9 a for\u00e7a que o faz persistir diante de todas as dificuldades que sofre. \n \nA promessa que jamais tocaria em armas \u00e9 explicada quando, em um momento de sua vida, quase matou seu pai, pois n\u00e3o suportou mais presenciar agress\u00f5es familiares contra sua m\u00e3e. Com esse princ\u00edpio em mente, ele se alista ao ex\u00e9rcito com o intuito de ser m\u00e9dico e apenas salvar vidas no campo de batalha, n\u00e3o portando nenhuma arma. Essa \u00e9 a peculiaridade da hist\u00f3ria desse her\u00f3i que torna toda sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a viol\u00eancia muito emocionante, pois voc\u00ea vai questionar bastante essa convic\u00e7\u00e3o, e como resposta, de maneira bem elaborada, o diretor vai mostrando os outros diversos epis\u00f3dios da vida de Doss que o faz cr\u00ea nesse princ\u00edpio antiviol\u00eancia.\n \nNa segunda etapa do filme, existe o alistamento no ex\u00e9rcito e ele tem que resistir a v\u00e1rias injusti\u00e7as em seu treinamento militar. Doss \u00e9 enquadrado como louco por seus superiores, afim de tenta-lo expuls\u00e1-lo, \u00e9 tido como covarde por n\u00e3o querer colocar uma arma em suas m\u00e3os, surrado por seus companheiros de alojamento e at\u00e9 julgado na corte marcial. Essas s\u00e3o verdadeiros testes as suas cren\u00e7as, contudo, os enfrenta de forma emocionante todas as vezes, desse modo, apesar da mar\u00e9 contr\u00e1ria, ele permanece no ex\u00e9rcito, pois n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada de errado em ser um objetor de consci\u00eancia e seus direitos s\u00e3o previstos na constitui\u00e7\u00e3o americana.\n \nTemos batalhas com imagens de corpos dilacerados em c\u00e2mera lenta, sangue jorrando por todos os lados e a luz amarelada das explos\u00f5es contrastando com a paisagem cinzenta. \u00c9 nesse cen\u00e1rio que Doss mostra que sempre foi o homem mais corajoso de seu batalh\u00e3o, trabalhando como medico entre as trincheiras e sendo guiado por sua f\u00e9, no qual, faz toda a diferen\u00e7a ao salvar 75 de seus amigos sem disparar um tiro. Nessa sequ\u00eancia de cenas de resgate, demonstram como Doss \u00e9 incr\u00edvel ao ser perseverante, mesmo sozinho, salvando todas aquelas pessoas e inclusive ajudou um dos seus inimigos, mostrando ser um real m\u00e9dico, que ajuda a todos sem preconceitos, dessa forma, esse filme presta uma homenagem mais do que merecida a um homem que salvou diversas vidas.\n\nEm resumo, o filme \u00e9 extremamente bom, digno de suas indica\u00e7\u00f5es ao Oscar, inclusive pela atua\u00e7\u00e3o de Andrew Garfield que est\u00e1 \u00f3tima. Achei que ele iria deixar a desejar, mas s\u00f3 venho me surpreendendo com esse ator, seu carisma \u00e9 muito bom, percorre toda a obra de maneira deslumbrante que te envolve completamente, tanto nas cenas de humor quanto nas tristes. Certamente o longa-metragem ir\u00e1 proporcionar muitos sentimentos e reflex\u00f5es.",

This movie is based on a true story, Desmond T Doss's life being a soldier serving in the army of the United States. He joined the army never using a gun. He didn't believe in violence when war is violence. He was recognized as a hero as he saved many lives including \"enemies\" lives.

However, once you get to the second half with the military training is when the story really shines. The conflict between his morals of not wanting to hold a gun due to religious belief vs the army leads to some proper moving storytelling. All of this builds up to the final act, the war, and this is just absolutely exhilarating! The movie delivers on horrific and tense war scenes that blow a lot of other WWII movies out the water.\n\nMel Gibson delivered a phenomenal WWII movie with great battle scenes and Andrew Garfield gives a terrific performance as Desmond Doss.

From going to basic training and having jokes made because of your religious beliefs and appearances. Also, the diversity of fighting for the right to not fight but rather to save really drew me into the story and character. During the battle scenes, he stuck to his word and never picked up a gun or did harm to others. However, he tended to the other side's soldiers. This shows his empathy and bravery to risk his life for the well-being of others. The very end of the movie was also one of my favorite scenes because it showed him lowering people down a mountain and tirelessly going back for more wounded and then lowering them down.",

Not that the family/character study stuff is bad, far from it, it's beautifully filmed, even better acted and paints Doss as a very fascinating character that it's easy from the get go to identify with his wants to succeed against all catastrophic odds.\n\nJust that the first third does take time to get going with a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is corny (in fact, to me the dialogue is the least good thing about 'Hacksaw Ridge' in general and the element that rings true the least) and the sentimentality is laid too thick (this is also particularly true in the slightly underdeveloped romance).\n\nHowever this is made up for by the entertaining yet hard-hitting training scenes and in particular the truly jaw-droppingly brutal war/battle scenes that soar in nerve-shredding intensity and raw emotion, giving the first 30 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan' a run for its money and perhaps making it tame in comparison (high praise for a film with one of the most gut-wrenching first 30 minutes on film, though to me the rest of the film isn't quite as good).\n\nThroughout 'Hacksaw Ridge' has exceptional production values, in particular the cinematography in the battle scenes, and Gibson directs like his life was depending on it. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score has the right amount of pulsating energy and nuance, and the sound effects in the war/battle scenes have a terrifying authenticity.\n\nFor a vast majority of the time, the story is very compelling and makes the most of mature and very easy to relate with themes. It has a wide range of emotional impact, being for the second half intensely powerful, much of the film being poignant, some of it sardonically amusing (without it being out of place) and also all of it inspirational. Rather than straying from the facts for dramatic license, Gibson is surprisingly respectful this time round.\n\nAndrew Garfield has yet to give a better performance than his astonishing turn here (though he is splendid too in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'), and Gibson similarly brings the best out of Sam Worthington (often a charisma-free actor but here doubts were cast aside) and Vince Vaughn (at his sardonic best while also touchingly subdued, proof that he can be good if the material serves him all which too often in his career it hasn't but it does brilliantly here). Hugo Weaving is terrific, also giving some of his best work in some time. Teresa Palmer makes the most of her role.\n\nIn conclusion, a near-triumphant come-back. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

They both have glory as a fundament, but Hackshaw Ridge is about so much more, and there is no fiction to the plot. The basic is what pure faith and conviction really can achieve and how much strenght it can give to someone who possesses it, under the most extreme circumstances. The battle of Okinawa was a totally insane and desperate chaos, and it is not presented as anything else. Still, there are no animated characters and almost no exaggerated American heroes, except from Desmond Doss, who must have been one very special fellow, and who is brilliantly portrayed by Andrew Garfield. Naturally, in a Mel Gibson film, there are some last minute scenes, just for the case of the drama, and the religious factor is given a special place. The battle scenes are like the opening D-day scene in Ryan many times over, and in the final battle scenes the director just had to take it over the top, quite unnecessarily so, which is the biggest minus. This sadly goes beyond the otherwise well balanced intention in the film. Too rarely are the cinematographical factors highlighted in film reviews, but this film received Academy Awards for both best film editing and sound mixing, and was nominated for several other categories, including best picture. It's all well deserved. There are many good acting performances to mention. However, the icing on the cake is the ever so lovely Teresa Palmer, as the war heroes' wife.",

Not saying his other ones aren't good, I mean Passion of the Christ is a brutal and honest portrayal on what would have happen leading up and during Jesus' execution, and Apocalypto is... Apocalypto. \nThe premise of the movie is actually pretty nuts... I mean yes it's based on a true story, but that's obviously what makes it so insane. I mean it's about a guy who refuses to fire at enemies, and instead runs in during all the firing and explosions to grab out soldiers that are half dead. In a way Mel Gibson is kind of the perfect choice for this as, with his other crazy films, he uses some pretty intense graphic and violent visuals to emphasize the insanity and tension of the situation Garfield's character keeps putting himself into. And Garfield himself actually does an amazing job with role and certainly deserved whatever nominations/awards he got for it.",

While Garfield has stepped in it plenty of times when it comes to talking about his acting, here we have him at his sweet naive best, the sort of pure open available person he probably wishes he could be in everyday life. He radiates a warmth, and while he's a Brit, there's a certain 'George Gibbs' American-like cheer in his step. One can't help but to fall in love with him, in the way that his smile is contagious, nearly infectious. What makes the best of war movies is tremendous heart, and at the core, we have that here. But make no mistake, the polar opposite is here in spades. The war scenes are devastating, dynamic and explosive. Unlike the life that seems to be seeping out of the bleeding bodies and into the ethers, the life of the images are wholly indelible. One wonders just how scenes like this are even made, with the seeming level of chaos, confusion and moving pieces. And all that violence is what makes Desmond Doss all that more unbelievable. And of course, it's a true story, which makes it all the more watchable. For those who lack the ability to entertain miracles of the human heart, this may not be your film, but for those who have a taste for faith (religious or otherwise) you'll find plenty to connect with in Gibson's war epic at Hacksaw Ridge.",

While this movie does start off a tad slower than other war movies it helps build a better story that will pay off when the war finally does come. And when it comes nothing is held back. The graphic realism of war helps to immerse the viewer into the battle. At its heart it is a classic story of outcast to hero done in a way that doesn't make it feel cliche, this is probably most in part to it being based on a true story. By the end of the film you're left with a good feeling making you believe in heroes again. I realize that sounds cheesy, but it's true.",

            "content": "One cannot deny that Mel Gibson can direct the hell out of a battle sequence but in this film the sequences would seem to go against the ideology of the subject and there is a horror in having the director openly delight in gruesome violence. Additionally the film is very much of two halves and unfortunately the first feels like a laughable parody version of The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) with how cheesy it is and the second half is entirely discordant with this opening. Many acclaimed the film as Gibson's comeback to mainstream Hollywood productions but I have little appreciation for the film beyond Gibson's technical abilities and I wish that it had a stronger screenplay and was less indulgent in graphic violence.\n\nAs a child in Virginia in the 1920s Desmond Doss, Andrew Garfield, almost kills his brother with a brick and is driven to adopt strict Seventh Day Adventist beliefs and is a conscientious objector when World War II begins. He chooses to enlist despite a romance with nurse Dorothy Schutte, Teresa Palmer, but is confronted by the aggressive Sergeant Howell, Vince Vaughn, when he refuses to learn how to use a weapon. He is almost convicted for his actions but when his superiors learn of new laws he is allowed to become a medic without using a gun. He is seen as a coward by his fellow soldiers but proves his heroism during a battle at Hacksaw Ridge during the Battle of Okinawa. He saves 75 men by helping them to escape down a ridge and men who had previously dismissed him are astonished by his bravery and conduct. He returns to civilian life after the war, marries Schutte and does not become boastful about his achievements by choosing instead to thank god.\n\nBefore I discuss the second half of the film, where Gibson's interest really lies, I must discuss the first half which felt more like a television soap opera than Since You Went Away (1944) or whatever 1940s classic he was attempting to evoke. Doss is clearly meant to come as na\u00efve but good hearted in his young adulthood but he seems to have some sort of mental issue as he awkwardly pursues the improbably beautiful nurse. The dialogue in their first date scene was atrocious and Schutte's constant smiles and gentle teasing made her seem like the sort of \n\u2018ideal' woman that housewives in the 1950s were pushed to act like. When he kisses her in a supposedly spontaneous moment it was totally manufactured and the moment in which Schutte pushes her religious boyfriend to marry her was so clich\u00e9 that it could have come out of a parody of this sort of film. The parallels with Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor (2001) were uncomfortable and much like that film you feel as bored as the director does waiting for the macho action to begin.\n\nThere is an equally awkward sequence before our men enter the battlefield that tries to get us invested in the \u2018zany' soldiers that Doss will be fighting alongside. We open with a surprisingly long shot of a man's buttocks and then hear a group of Australian actors introduce themselves in thick \u2018Brooklyn' accents. This does little to make us care and there are so many films that these scenes are reminiscent of, from Full Metal Jacket (1987) to From Here to Eternity (1953), that it is hard to view them on their own. Then he introduces the arbitrary drama of having him court martialed and then ends this part of the film on a dull note as his superiors are informed of a fact that they should have already known.\n\nWhen Doss finally finds himself on the battlefield you can sense that Gibson has relaxed as he does choreograph stunning scenes of gore and violence that inform the audience of the horror of fighting in a war. However beyond all of the explosions and close up shots of blood leaking out of men's severed legs there is the uncomfortable feeling that Gibson is enjoying all of this a little too much and unlike his pacifist hero completely endorses violence. \n\nThe film definitely deserved to be honored for the technical achievements that it made but as a whole it is a disappointment as the points it tries to make about pacifism are buried under Gibson's passion for violence and the dialogue is too hokey to be taken seriously.",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge\nHacksaw Ridge isn't your typical war movie. Director Mel Gibson takes the clich\u00e9s of heroism from other war movies and portrays them in an entirely different yet effective way. Ardent patriotism and religious conviction are the central focuses of Mel Gibson's film Hacksaw Ridge. The main character, Desmond Doss - a conscientious objector - refused to carry a weapon into battle yet his bravery in doing so saved the lives of many men during World War II at the battle of Okinawa.  \n\tHacksaw Ridge begins by depicting an ordinary family who have deeply imbedded religious beliefs with two competitive and rambunctious brothers - Desmond and Howard Doss. Their father - once a World War I veteran - grieves from survivors' guilt, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and is a raging alcoholic who is inclined to have violent outbreaks. Outbreaks which are often directed towards Rachel, Desmond's mother. One night during his childhood, Desmond witnessed his father violently abuse and attack his mother at gun point at which point he intervened, grabbed the gun, and pointed it back towards his father. This traumatic experience, along with his spiritual convictions (thou shall not kill), lead Desmond to enlist as a combat medic and to become a conscious objector in World War II, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Desmond's enlistment drove a greater wedge between him and his father. He was angry with his son because he had no desire for either of his sons (both of which ended up enlisting) to serve in the military. \n\tOnce enlisted, Desmond attended basic training where he was ridiculed and begged to leave due to his religious beliefs and his standpoint on carrying a weapon. Shortly into his training, Desmond was Court-Martialed and thrown into a war prison for disobeying a direct order from his commanding officer. Eventually, with the help of his father (which was surprising due to their relationship), Desmond was released from prison and granted the right to enter the war zone as a conscientious objector. At this point in the movie Desmond proves his worth at Okinawa by participating in the attack on Hacksaw Ridge where he saves the lives of many soldiers who would have otherwise died.\n\tMel Gibson separates from the clich\u00e9s of heroism by showing the internal struggle of an individual (Desmond Doss) rather than the outward struggle many soldiers face on the battlefield. The internal struggle in Hacksaw Ridge is between Desmond's religious beliefs to not kill under any circumstances, and his ardent patriotism - the desire to serving his country during the war. Many directors of war movies focus only on the outward struggles soldiers face during war by depicting the skirmishes they face on the battlefield. Gibson however, portrays both the struggle on the battlefield, as well as in the mind and heart of one specific soldier. \nTake for example another popular war movie Saving Private Ryan. In this film, the director Steven Spielberg portrays the external struggles of a group of soldiers to represent their heroism and willingness to serve their country. Gibson opted to divert from this clich\u00e9 by portraying the heroic struggle within an individual who wanted to serve his country despite the fact his religious beliefs (to not kill) went against what was optimal for soldiers fighting at that time. This internal struggle Desmond faces makes Hacksaw Ridge more relatable than any other war movie because it is personal and portrays the struggles many of us face between our internal beliefs and the external stimuli we're surrounded by. Although many of us aren't fighting in a war, we face things daily that challenge our internal beliefs just like Desmond. \nWhile the story and messages portrayed in Hacksaw Ridge alone make for a great film, the effects used throughout create a sense of realism which in turn make the internal struggles that Desmond faces appear more severe. As the war progresses, Desmond witnesses many of his friends die painfully around him without the capability or resources to protect and defend them from their enemies. In many cases, individuals who witness traumatic events (such as the events Desmond faced during the war) become more inclined to stray from their internal (religious or emotional) beliefs in order to defend and protect themselves as well as those they care about. This however wasn't the case when it came to Desmond Doss' internal struggles. Not only did Desmond stay true to his religious beliefs by remaining a conscious objector throughout the duration of the war, he took those beliefs and used them to help save the lives of many soldiers.\nOne night after the US military retreated from Hacksaw, Desmond made the heroic decision to stay on the ridge, where he beseeched God asking, \"What is it you want of me; I don't understand; I can't hear you.\" Alone, and without any way of defending himself, Desmond stayed on the ridge begging and pleading to hear God's voice. As he sat there praying to hear God's voice, he heard someone faintly scream for a medic. Unwaveringly, Desmond got up and ran into the battlefield because he knew it was God's voice in someone who needed his help. All night Desmond continued asking God to help him save one more and one more and one more... Taking each opportunity given to him (by God), Desmond continued to hoist injured, dead, and even enemy soldiers off Hacksaw Ridge. All the while, his only protection was asking for God's help in getting each soldier off the ridge.\nAgainst all odds, and despite the ridicule Desmond Doss faced from fellow soldiers in the opening scenes of the film, Desmond changed the lives of many soldiers including those who tormented and begged him to quit from the start. He displayed countless acts of heroism in a different way than any other soldier at that time. Gibson did an immaculate job of portraying how one individual soldier's countless acts of selflessness impacted the lives of many individuals who would have otherwise died. It was because of Desmond's patriotism that many soldiers were able to make it home to their families rather than dying on Hacksaw. Although Desmond Doss was a conscientious objector and went into one of the bloodiest battles of World War II without anything to protect himself, he survived. Not only did he survive, he helped many individuals live to see another day. Because of his bravery and heroism Desmond Doss received the Medal of Honor and is now known as one of the greatest war heroes of all time.",

The Religious overtones are certainly there but not to hit the audience over the head with preachy sermons or \"Bible Thumping\". It's a story about one man's convictions and his unrelenting dedication to them. The pacing is good, the characters all likable, with a surprise role from Vince Vaughn, who I think did a great job as the tough Drill Sergeant. Garfield was fantastic and so adorable in this role. He plays the character perfect and is immediately likable and is someone the audience invests in. And as for the battle sequences, well, I'll let them speak for themselves (They are literally bloody amazing and scary all at the same time)! Also, THIS IS A TRUE STORY. A story I myself have researched and was surprised by how much Gibson had left out of the movie to make it \"more believable\", which is just insane! I am confidently saying, this is my favorite movie from 2016!",

This happened to me, for example, I didn't really drink alcohol, but when I found a girl I liked, I started to drink some wine, not much though. Maybe the difference is that in my case love, one of the strongest emotions, made me change slightly, so it's hard to resist, while in his case there was no love, but he had his principles and his goals which were very important. Maybe that means he was even stronger than love because he had to leave his girl? In any case, that is absolutely incredible.\nThis guy reminds me a lot of me, except he's even stronger than me.\n\nThere is a lot of blood and violence in this movie, but I had the time to look away, so I didn't see too much gross things.\n\nThis movie was very emotional, and I had tears on my eyes and tension throughout the whole movie, not just here and there like it is in some movies. It was very interesting and thanks God for all he does.\n\nIt is interesting that in war people still save their faith in God and maybe even become stronger, even though you might think that seeing all these torn bodies, torn humans which look like simple organisms might make you think that there's no God, but it seems that's not the case. People's faith becomes even stronger in war. For example like everyone wanted Desmond to pray in the end.\nAlso it seems like a lot of people believe in God one way or another.\n\nI recommend this movie to everyone.",

            "content": "Strengths: I chose to watch this movie because it was nominated for Best Picture a few years back. I see why. The story is Oscar bait, telling a courageous true story. Mel Gibson nailed his work as a director here. He handles the first half of the film solidly, giving us plenty of strong character moments. It's the second half where he truly shines, though. The war sequences are brutal and tense. Body parts fly around, there are abrupt deaths, and you feel like you're right there watching the action in person. It makes sense that this was also nominated for editing and sound mixing. The experience on the battlefield is something truly special. Andrew Garfield (Desmond Doss) gives one of the best performances of his career, other than the bad accent. The rest of the cast like Hugo Weaving (Tom Doss), Sam Worthington (Jack Glover), and the surprisingly strong Vince Vaughn (Sgt. Howell) all bring their best.\n\nWeaknesses: The movie feels long. You completely feel every single minute because some parts do drag in the early stages. Teresa Palmer (Dorothy Schutte) is the one actor who doesn't feel like they're doing a great job. She's not flat out bad, but she lacks something. Her chemistry with Andrew Garfield is almost non-existent, so the love story plot never really works. \n\nOverall: This blew me away and was way better than I expected. Other than some pacing issues and the love story, everything works. We have strong characters, a good script, great direction, and the feel like we're truly watching the brutal nature of war.",

            "content": "This felt like 2 films stitched together. The first half is pretty boring and drags on far too long. We are introduced  to the key characters we are meant to care most about, we are shown why the main character is who he is and what his family life did to create the ultimate pacifist during war. The redeeming factor is the second half. Mel Gibson simply creates these amazingly brutal, realistic battle sequences that hold nothing back. The very first death is shocking in its bloodiness and its abruptness, having a survivor of the previous siege become reanimated, giving away the position of the battalion. Once this has happened, we see his head blown off, followed immediately by the death of the man who disturbed him being dealt a similar fate. The following sequence showcases just how brutal war can be, displaying death as being as normal as breathing. This film being based on a true story adds a sense of amazement as you realize not only is this plausible, but it is also what happened. Watching a man, carrying little more then a giant first aid kit, save 75 men who had been injured during 2 days of fighting upon the titular ridge and roping them down the massive expanse at the detriment of his hands. Andrew Garfield, horrible accent aside, plays this role very well, especially as we get more into the war time scenes and the training sequences. This film was nominated for 6 Oscars, winning for film editing and sound mixing, two things that truly mesmerized me during this film. My only complaint is that we did not get a pay off of the brother going to war first nor do we get any insight into the motivations of the father as he helps his son get into the army and also hearing what he has done in Okinawa. This movie is not for the faint of heart, the depictions of war, fighting and death are very realistic and can be offensive or nauseating to those that are not ready for it.

Is real a movie with a really good message,? keep with me to know it....\nThe director behind this movie is Mel Gibson, a great  his is a war movie, but isn't a normal war movie, this one is special because something that we're going to talk about it later. This movie happens in an island in the pacific near Japan called Okinawa.\nThe actors in this movie are, Andrew Garfield, you may know him because he starred in Spiderman 1 and 2 (2012 and 2014). e's Pvt. Desmond Doss (the protagonist),Teresa Palmer as Dorothy Schutte and Vince Vaughn as St. Howell. In my opinion they  a great performance, because the characters feel real and everyone has a different personality with a different story and everyone fit in together naturally and any role looks forced or is dull. That's a great point \nWhat's this movie about? Well I'm going to tell you a summary, calm down, is spoiler free, lets start.  I like that :)\nThis movie move us to 1945, during WW2 and introduced us to Desmond D. Doss, a man on his 20's that isn't secure who is he. And him in some way feels trapped because of his family. His father (a WW1 veteran) is an alcoholic and mistreat him; his brother; and his mother. This changes when his brother enlist to the U.S. army. He starts thinking and his conclucion is than he can't stay calm when a lot of people are dying because of the war, so he enlisted as a medic, because he doesn't want to touch a gun because of a trauma. From this point to the end of the movie, we can see a Desmond that is changing, because of the live of a soldier. but he always keep his ideals, helping all the people he can.  How he can afront all the problems that he has and how he saved 75 soldiers than were hurried in the battlefield, and later how he sacrifice himself to save his partners. At the end of the movie, we can see a brave man that has clear who he is and his purpose in life.\nWell, this is a small summary of the movie plot.I think that now you can make you an idea of it. In my opinion, this story is really good,(is almost perfect) the only problem is that sometimes can be so difficult to understand and can be so gore in some parts of it, but in front of that, is a really good and interesting movie that you should see if you didn't watch it yet. \nWhatever, now let's talk about the movie impressive qualities,\nCinematography: In my opinion, the cinematography of this movie is perfect, the colors reflect exactly what it wants to tell us and it creates the perfect ambient in every single scene.\nSoundtrack, the soundtrack is also really good (because of that, it won the oscar price for the best sound) and also the sound effects are precise in each case of the movie .\nDefinitely the best scene of the movie is when Desmont save the hurt soldiers that were left in the battlefield (because of this he won the medal of the brave in the movie). This the best, because is so dramatic and you don't know what's going to happen next. \nSpecial effects, the special effects are very realistic and in some parts you can feel that you were in the movie, so cool.\nEmotional effects, This can be the only part of the movie that is not so good.at, This is because they didn't get that the people become sad or excited in all the necessary parts.\nWell, this was my review about (in my opinion) one of the best movies ever. That have really good things, but in some parts, can be very gore for someone's or also can be a little bit confusing.\nHowever, I supposed that I should grate this movie no? So this is my final grate for this movie:\n9,86/10\nI know that someone can be in disagreement with me, but remember that is just an opinion. Well, in respect of the fans, they were happy about the movie:\nYou should see it, because it has really good messages and great actors. \nWell, like I said before, I'm going to explain the meaning of this movie, this one is:\nAlways be there to help the other: This message is in all the movie.Every action;dialog and scene in someway, arrives to this message:be there and give all of yourself to save others.\nWell, that was my review, I hope that you like it, so, what are you waiting? Go to your TV and watch Hacksaw Ridge.\n\n\"With the world so set on tearing itself apart, I don't seem like such a bad thing to me to wanna put a little bit of it back together\" \n\nBy Agustin",

So I was only a little irritated that the movie has him signing up for the army. I kept saying, \"He was drafted. He was drafted.\" I felt it made him look stupid to sign up as a \"conscientious objector\". But that's only a small flaw in an otherwise marvelous tribute to this war hero. The movie doesn't even show the half of the persecution he came under during boot camp. They made his life a living hell. And even as fantastically heroic as the movie portrays him, and how miraculous his single-handedly saving 75 men was, it actually holds back some. Gibson wanted the movie to be believable and some of what actually happened to Doss was unbelievable. Doss actually wasn't crouching down many times, he was standing erect shouting down instructions to his fellow soldiers as tons of bullets whizzed by him, never hitting him. One Japanese soldier told that he had Doss in his sites and his gun jammed several times and he was unable to shoot him. If you can handle the true depiction of war this is a must see film. It doesn't hold back on the violence and gore. (And even unnecessarily shows things happening in slow-mo. This is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars.) Vince Vaughn was excellent as the drill sergeant. He makes you laugh at first and then he makes you cry toward the end. My eyes filled with tears when the real Desmond Doss was shown receiving his Medal of Honor from President Truman. You've just got to see this guy's story!",

I've heard some people say that they couldn't see a Woody Allen because \"he's a perv\" and some saying the same for Tarantino because he can be too loud (for me, he's the man!). I've never been one of this people but I do believe we have to take into consideration a filmmaker's life to understand his work. Thus, my perception of The 400 Blows wouldn't be the same without me knowing about Truffaut's childhood or Edward Scissorhands would be less impactful had I not known of Burton's inner struggles growing up. I truly believe that Mel Gibson is a despicable person and not that great of an actor... But, he's a talented director! Firstly, the film is based on a great true story that everyone should learn about which is a great structure to the fine script. Garfield is powerful and believable in the character, Hugo Weaving is menacing and, surprisingly, Vince Vaughn is a pertinent casting decision.  What may stand out the most about this film is how Gibson constructs a battle scene. He does it without mercy, showing us the true nature of war, all the blood and guts splattering all over, the big explosions and the courage in the soldier's eyes. This, which is supported by thoughtful editing, rugged cinematography and convincing makeup/ SFX work makes up for an immersive experience that is both engrossing and hard to look away from. It's war in it's purest form, like I haven't seen for a while. The problem is precisely when the director's personality surfaces and lets his over-nationalistic pride take over the whole picture. In this day and age, I do think that we shouldn't portray enemies, villains, etc in any kind of movie as generic, as nothing more than evil. This dehumanization of the antagonist is all too problematic in this film, as the Japanese seem to serve the only purpose of being blown up. Furthermore, the stereotypically southern way characters interact, how they create friendships, how they fall in love makes it hard for me to relate to them. Still, the film hit me hard at the end when footage of the real Desmond Doss was shown and I no longer could fight the tears. It's like Gibson was able to pass on to me the ominous patriotic feel and give me a taste of what war actually feels like, which is no easy feat.",

            "content": "It has been my belief that in war, most of the time there are no heroes, only participants. But, in Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge, there is a hero. A hero in its truest sense. In this year's another sensational film, La La Land, we saw how it is important to never let go of what you want or what you dream, even if the circumstances are trying. In Hacksaw Ridge, we see even in dire situations and in face of dreadful consequences how it is important to never let go of who you are. \n\nFor in Hacksaw Ridge, the protagonist Desmond Doss reminds us that it is the belief, the ideology of person and their actions that define them and not the fulfillment of norms. Based on true events, the film tells the story of an American man who becomes the first Conscientious Objector to win the Medal of Honor. To put in a simpler term, Desmond Doss' belief and conscience does not allow him to kill another human being, or even pick a gun. He still enlists to serve as a combat medic.\n\nWhat follows, is a struggle. Both internal and external where Doss is subjected to humiliation, violence and time in jail. There even comes a time when he had to choose between love and the belief that made him the person he is. But, his unfaltering energy and determination to stay true in its own eyes make him the hero that this film is celebrating. \n\nMel Gibson and writers Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan strike the perfect balance between a biographical drama and a war film. At one side, the battle scenes are shot exquisitely. Filled with realism and horrors of war. Gibson doesn't pull his punches in showing the harrowing brutality. The film would remind people of the battles in Saving Private Ryan or in the excellent mini-series Band of Brothers. At another side, there's enough room in the film to explore the life of Doss. The relationship with his father, his love for his wife, all these beautifully depicts the tenderness, the gentle yet resolute soul of Doss. \n\nAndrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss and I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job than him in this role. Garfield's boyish charm reflects the character's innocence. Be it when he flirts or when he refuses to carry firearms, he seems sincere and determined and yet gentle and sweet. The film is buoyed by the heroism of the character of Desmond Doss, which in turn is buoyed by Garfield's acting. The chemistry between Garfield and a fine Teresa Palmer, who plays Dorothy, Desmond's wife, strikes the emotional chord enough to give a dramatic dimension in this film. Speaking of emotional bond, Hugo Weaving churns a top performance as Doss' father. You feel the desperation and the frustration his character feels when his sons enlist in the army, as he had watched most of his friends die while serving himself. The supporting cast of 77th Infantry Division, including Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, and Vince Vaughn, does well too. Particularly Vaughn.\n\nMel Gibson directs this film after a gap of approximately 10 years, and it would appear that the time has not put rust on his direction mettle. Hacksaw Ridge is perhaps the best War film of this decade and certainly one of the finest of this genre.",

            "content": "Over-the-top and excessive in every aspect (some might say indulgent, but others seem to love over-dramatized films like this), from the stereotypic love story to the unrelenting battle scenes.  Mel Gibson directed and having not seen any other films by him, I can only suspect that the mix of hard-core religion and ultra-violence is his own personal signature.  Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who nevertheless signs up for combat duty in WWII (in the Pacific theatre) to serve as a medic.  He gets hard done by during boot camp, pilloried for his religious beliefs and nearly court-martialled and drummed out of the service for refusing to carry a weapon.  But, of course, he prevails and ends up with the medal of honour.  The true story upon which the film is based is undoubtedly moving and inspiring but the syrupy ode to the man is pretty tough to take at times.  The centrepiece of the film is more than an hour of gory battle scenes, with corpses everywhere, men dying in horrific fashion, and a genuine hell-on-earth mise-en-scene.  Perhaps this is how battle really feels - but do you really need to see it?  I'm sure the technical wizardry required is impressive but again, the sweeping music and dramatic crescendos nearly capsize things.  A bunch of Australians take roles here (alongside an always charismatic Vince Vaughan) but few are able to define their characters above the fray.  Watch if you must but there are better war films (e.g., The Steel Helmet, 1951 or The Big Red One, 1980, both by Sam Fuller).",

After a decade in limbo and Gibson passing on the project twice (same with Braveheart) finance coming in from Australia this true life story finally gets a cinematic outing.\u00a0\n?The film is based on the true story of Desmond Doss played by Andrew Garfield an conscientious objector who joins the army in WW2 but refuses to carry or use a weapon.\u00a0\n\nThis film is by all facts a mixed genre film being Action/Drama. The first half is almost a tender TV Drama showing the story of Doss from childhood , the series of events that shape him as a man and later his decision\u00a0to join the army but keep to devout his religious beliefs.\u00a0\nDoss is by all means a unique individual who cares deeply about family, honour and faith taking joy in helping others.\u00a0\n\nHis decision\u00a0to join the army in order to be a medic is one that causes friction around him but the decision\u00a0that he will not use a weapon is one that causes most provocation for Doss who becomes the point of hatred in the army. Victimised, picked on, attacked and taken to military court Doss is risking everything he has for everything he believes and the unfolding of his predicament is touching entertaining drama at it's best.\u00a0\n?The second half of the film sees Doss enter War and not since From Dusk Till Dawn has there been a more violent Genre shift from Drama to Action/Horror as Gibson shows you first hand the extreme horrors of War. You can understand the pursuit of Gibson services as his CV shows his no novice at War films having directed Braveheart and later shown true horrors of violence in The Passion Of The Christ here he brings all his skills to the table. Pulling no punches with the extreme shift in tempo shows a slight glimpse of what the real life soldiers of war most of envisioned when they first step foot into the hells of the battlefields and futility of war with such wasted life on both sides.\u00a0\n\n\nIn this hell the soldiers are expected to take Hacksaw Ridge a viscous battle that will cost many lives. It's in this hell that Doss makes it his mission to risk his life in order to save as many lives as possible. This is where the real life Doss reportedly saved 75 wounded soldiers an outstanding feet that made him a hero.\u00a0\nThere is excellent supporting acting with highlights from Hugo Weaving one of Hollywood most underrated talents who plays Doss's Father horrendously mentally handicapped from his fighting in WW1 as well a welcomed comedy relief from Vince Vaughn as Doss's stern commanding officer. \u00a0\u00a0?\n\nGibson features real life footage at the end of the film which shows you the real life Doss and it's only here you can then fully appreciate the amazing Job Andrew Garfield did of portraying him as the real life Doss has a unique speaking pattern that seemed odd when first watching the film but then replaced when you appreciate the actors replicated authentically. You would expect most Hollywood films to disregard such attention to details having Doss persona replaced by a more bankable image with a John Wayne type lead marching over the Ridge saving everyone in sight. The choice not to do reinforces the remarkable real life story of a man that was utterly selfless demonstrating the best of human potential.\u00a0\n\n?This is glorious to see this type of story made and most importantly respected. In such depressing real life times we live in where there is constant examples of negative behaviour it's a true refreshing experience to see a recreation of truly decent example of a human ability for goodness. The decision\u00a0to put real life clips at the end of the film and show the audiences the true hero we saw who tells the audience his will to save others in the darkest hour of war is what moved this review from four stars to five. \u00a0\n?Further research into the real life Doss actually depicts that the film toned down some of the real heroism to make it more believable is a testimonial in itself.\u00a0",

Hacksaw Ridge, starring Andrew Garfield (Desmond), Teresa Palmer (Dorothy), and  Vince Vaughn (Sergeant Howell), brings a pack of punch to the world of camp and war. Andrew Garfield (Desmond) is a country boy who is on a mission to save people in the war, but he encounters problems along the way that could possibly stop that from happening. Without giving up he goes to the head general to state that he only wants to save people and not fight. The movie is directed by Mel Gibson, who has also directed The Expendables 3 and The Lethal Weapon series, so if you like movies with gunfire this is a really good movie. Overall the movie looks great; Desmond's action based skills are over the top compared to everyone else. He is one of the bravest medics ever in a war.  However as the movie goes on Desmond never changes his attitude as he fights the war. Andrew Garfield's  performance was outstanding and making you want to finish the movie to see how it plays out, much like Bradley Cooper (Chris Kyle) in American Sniper with the dedication to save and protect his country. Overall I give this movie five out of five stars. So if you can take a little blood and explosions sit down with some snacks and enjoy the movie.",

This experience and his Seventh-day Adventist upbringing reinforce Desmond's belief in the commandment \"Thou shalt not kill\". Years later, Doss takes an injured man to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer). The two begin a relationship and Doss tells Dorothy of his interest in medical work. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Doss enlists in the Army and intends to serve as a combat medic. His father Tom, a troubled World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Before leaving for Fort Jackson, he asks for Dorothy's hand in marriage and she accepts. Doss is placed under the command of Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn). He excels physically but becomes an outcast among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover  (Sam Worthington) attempt to discharge Doss for psychiatric reasons but are overruled, as Doss' religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Doss by putting him through grueling labor, intending to get Doss to leave of his own accord. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers and continues training. Doss' unit completes basic training and is released on leave, during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Doss in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his trial, Doss pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married. Doss' unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and deployed to the Pacific theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, Doss' unit is informed that they are to relieve the 96th Infantry Division, which was tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (\"Hacksaw Ridge\"). In the initial fight, both sides sustain heavy losses, and Doss successfully saves several wounded soldiers. The Americans camp for the night, which Doss spends in a foxhole with Smitty, a squadmate who was the first to call Doss a coward. Doss reveals that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage and the two make amends. The next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, while Howell and several of Doss' squad mates are left injured on the battlefield. Doss hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying wounded soldiers to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Hacksaw Ridge uses a real-life pacifist's legacy to lay the groundwork for a gripping wartime tribute to faith, valor, and the courage of remaining true to one's convictions.\" The Milford Daily News called the film a \"masterpiece\", adding that it \"is going to end up on many 2016 Top 10 lists, that should get Oscar nominations for Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.\" Maggie Stancu of Movie Pilot wrote that \"Gibson made some of his most genius directing choices in Hacksaw Ridge, and Garfield has given his best performance yet. With amazing performances by Vince Vaughn, Teresa Palmer, Sam Worthington and Hugo Weaving, it is absolutely one of 2016's must-see films.\" Mick LaSalle of SFGate called the film \"a brilliant return for Mel Gibson, which confirms his position as a director with a singular talent for spectacle and a sure way with actors.\" In The Film Lawyers, Samar Khan called Hacksaw Ridge \"fantastic,\" and emphasised \"just how wonderful it is to have Gibson back in a more prominent position in Hollywood, hopefully with the demons of his past behind him. If Hacksaw Ridge is any indication, we are poised for a future filled with great films from the visionary director.\" The Daily Telegraph awarded four stars, and added: \"Hacksaw Ridge is a fantastically moving and bruising war film that hits you like a raw topside of beef in the face - a kind of primary-coloured Guernica that flourishes on a big screen with a crowd.\" The Guardian also awarded the film four stars, and stated that Gibson had \"absolutely hit Hacksaw Ridge out of the park.\" The Australian's reviewer was equally positive, stating that, as a director, \"Gibson's approach is bold and fearless; this represents his best work to date behind the camera.\" Rex Reed of Observer rated it with four stars, and called it \"the best war film since Saving Private Ryan... [I]t is violent, harrowing, heartbreaking and unforgettable. And yes, it was directed by Mel Gibson. He deserves a medal, too\". Michael Smith of Tulsa World called Hacksaw Ridge a \"moving character study\" and praised both the direction and acting: \"It's truly remarkable how Gibson can film scenes of such heartfelt emotion with such sweet subtlety as easily as he stages some of the most vicious, visual scenes of violence that you will ever see. ... Hacksaw Ridge is beautiful and brutal, and that's a potent combination for a movie about a man determined to serve his country, as well as his soul.\" IGN critic Alex Welch gave a score of 8/10, praising it as \"one of the most successful war films of recent memory,\" and \"at times horrifying, inspiring, and heart-wrenching.\" Mike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a positive review, praising Gibson's direction and saying, \"There are two moments during the second half of Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge when I literally jumped out of my seat in terror. The film's depiction of war is the best I've seen since Saving Private Ryan.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5 stars, writing, \"Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a filmmaker, able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness.\" In contrast, Matt Zoller Seitz for RogerEbert.com gave the film 2.5 stars, and described the film as \"a movie at war with itself.\"\n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is visually stunning at times and Mel Gibson has tried to make a classic epic warmovie from back in the days with an obvious large budget. However, he hasn\u00b4t really succeeded in my point of view compared to all the praise it has been given. The script and plot offers not much to excite you and it\u00b4s pretty much predictable from the first 30 minutes. And Gibson has used all the clich\u00e9s he can imagine. The problem is as well that the heroic actions taken by Doss on the battlefield becomes almost cartoony and too Jesus like and makes Doss real life bravery a bit off in my opinion. Meaning that Gibson hasn\u00b4t managed to film that in a satisfying way. And you can\u00b4t dodge the fact that Gibson has put so much emphasis on catholic themes looking like propaganda, it is pretty clear that was part of his agenda when making the film. The action scenes have a bit too clear CGI effects, the film has a not satisfying casting (for example Vince Vaughn (terrible) and I don\u00b4t like Andrew Garfield whom I don\u00b4t think is convincing as Doss) and there\u00b4s a bit too much general flagwaving. But, you can\u00b4t take away the bravery of real Desmond Doss and what he did during WWII. It\u00b4s a shame the film can\u00b4t manage to portray that in a proper way.",

It's some of the worst war cinematography and production that Hollywood has ever produced. People are getting upset about all of the gory violence, but that doesn't bother me because it was so over the top it was like a bad 1980s horror film. What was really bad was the directing, because at no point is there any sense of tactical awareness by any soldier in the whole dang movie. The artillery looks like the hollywood charges that they are. Soldiers just get in a mob and run at machine guns. There's a lot of smoke and cut shots that just don't work.\n\nVince Vaugn machine guns like 12 enemies while Garfield drags him on a blanket through a battlefield.

            "content": "Based on the true story of Desmond Doss, Hacksaw Ridge tells the extraordinary story of how he became a medic as a conscientious objector in WWII and saved many lives without ever firing a gun.\nThe acting is fantastic across the board and this is Andrew Garfield's best performance to date, as Desmond Doss he is able to embody a simple naivety, somewhat akin to Forest Gump, and a great wealth of emotion as his character develops but stays true to his beliefs. Hugo Weaving also puts in a layered performance as his father, Tom Doss, who is a damaged and violent man bearing the scars of his time in the military. Luke Bracey also makes a great, somewhat villainous character Smitty Ryker, who gets a reasonable character arc but could have done with a little more screen time.\nBeing based around real events and real people, the plot is extremely interesting and truly inspiring. Due to his upbringing and his religion Desmond has a very strong set of principles and refuses to take a life and rather help the war effort by saving lives as a medic. The obstacles he faces and the dedication he has to this goal is truly inspiring and has a very uplifting message.\nThe pace is a little inconsistent throughout the film, there is quite a long build to the conflict at Hacksaw Ridge where the pace is slow but it's well used with character development and back story that pays off as the pace speeds up. The tension is also built up very well leading to the initial gunfire and it manages to maintain this at the crucial moments towards the end of the film. The romantic storyline however is the weakest part of the film, with quite cheesy dialogue and moments that could have been cut down. The other men Desmond undertakes his training with are also a little cartoonish and could have done with a little more character development to get the audience more invested in their welfare at Hacksaw Ridge. \nThe action scenes on the other hand are very well done and don't glorify it. The violence is extremely brutal and realistic looking and really draws you into the shock and horror of those moments. The sound design in these scenes is also extremely good and the use of slow motion really amplifies the more horrifying or heroic moments. \nThis film really is masterfully performed and directed and manages to stand out as something truly special and different from a lot of other war films.",

His ultimate engagement is unbelievable and the definition of a hero. While you feel some parts may be a bit exaggerated, the actual quotes the movie ends with prove many details right. On the other side, the film is neither particularly subtle about Doss' belief nor in making monsters out of the enemy. The final taking of Hacksaw Ridge is portrayed rather questionably. Still, Doss' unimaginable heroism is a story worth telling.",

Hacksaw Ridge is a very decent piece of film and if it is totally based upon the truth then the man who takes centre stage was certainly one of the bravest and toughest soldiers out there.  Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss who due to events in his private life while growing up becomes a pacifist and conscientious objector to war.  This earns him the the label of coward from his fellow soldiers who want nothing to do with him as they believe he has no right to be on the battlefield.  However, Doss was the first man ever to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour without picking up a single weapon due to the number of lives he saved on the battlefield at Okinawa.  An inspirational film with a decent turn from Andrew Garfield and surprisingly, Vince Vaughan as his sergeant who comes out with some of the best insults since Lee Ermey's Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket.",

Unknown to the commander that Doss had stayed behind to search for the wounded under heavy Japanese troops attack.  Nothing short of a miracle and a requirement of  superhuman strength to accomplish the super heroic feat. . Not since Saving Private Ryan has another film depicted war violence so gruesomely bloody,realistically and relentlessly. Severed limbs and bullet entry wounds were just too realistic for comfort. I was squirming a lot while watching the scenes of massacre.  Excellent film with a huge dose of Christian faith that enabled Doss to display selfless heroism.

The story is about a man who enlists as a medic in a war with Japan during the end of WW2, without bearing arms. Just that story alone was brilliant enough to get me captivated, and the movie around it was absolutely astonishing. The intensity of the battle scenes, seeing the violence, gore, and trauma that soldiers experience in the battlefield was slightly disturbing, but all the more exhilarating. This is a war movie that successfully shows you what it takes to have the courage to serve your country in battle, without glorifying violence or war. Andrew Garfield (Desmond T. Doss) did a fantastic job at portraying this war hero, and was just as good in the battle scenes than he was in the other, lighter scenes, where we got insight into his home life and his relationship with his wife. I also have to mention Vince Vaughn (Sgt. Howell), even though I'm so used to seeing him in comedy movies, this complete change of direction in his character worked really well, and he was great in his role as the intimidating, yet sarcastic Sergeant. There are a lot of scenes in this movie which really show the bare fear that these soldiers have throughout the war, which is a bit of a change from the other movies, who always portray the soldiers as immune, unstoppable heroes. This way, it shows more of the human side of these soldiers, and really showed me what it could have been like in the actual battlefield if you were outnumbered and about to get flanked. The story of Desmond Doss is one of courage, strength and an incredible amount of bravery, which sound like a cliche for these war movies, but \"Hacksaw Ridge\" takes it to a whole other level. The intensity and exhilaration that came with this movie, leaves me saying that \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is unbelievable.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Let s take a look at Mel Gibson s latest offering - Hacksaw Ridge.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Its a story about a great hero from our home state of Virginia. How cool is that? Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to young Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) who lives with his WWI veteran father, his mother, and older brother. Doss has fallen in love with a beautiful young nurse at the local hospital. When his brother joins the army to fight the Nazis, Doss decides to join too. But he s a conscientious objector. As a child he often got into fights with his brother and nearly killed him once. That experience, and his Seventh-Day Adventist upbringing, caused him to vow never to touch a gun. Naturally, this belief engages him in some friction when he enlists.\n\nSCOTT: Doss refuses to handle a gun during training, and as a result his commanding officer, Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) makes Doss s life miserable as a soldier. Howell also tries to have Doss discharged for psychiatric reasons. Doss, however, refuses to quit and is about to be court martialed until his father (Hugo Weaving) intervenes by pulling a favor with the Brigadier General. Doss is finally allowed to serve as a medic in the war, and is sent to fight in Okinawa without a gun.\n\nGREG: Scott, I was surprised by this film. I had anticipated a Christian Inspirational. So many Christian films put the message ahead of the story and the film suffers as a result. Hacksaw puts story front and center. And in doing so, delivers its message in spectacular form. On the other hand, I was surprised by the brutality and graphic nature of the film. Steven Spielberg s Saving Private Ryan was well-known for its graphic portrayal of war. But director Mel Gibson has raised the bar to new heights - or perhaps lowered it to new lows - depending on your point of view. This view of war makes clear just how horrible war can be. There were images of dismembered bodies, entrails, and killing that were so graphic, the viewer can believe they were in a war.\n\nSCOTT: I m with you, Greg. Hero stories don t come any better than this. Doss possesses most if not all of the Great Eight traits of heroes -- he s smart, strong, reliable, caring, selfless, resilient, and inspiring. You could even argue that he is quietly charismatic. His heroic power also derives from his ability to resist social pressure. Doss receives intense heat to conform to military standards, and he s probably the only hero I know who sticks to his guns by eschewing them. After watching almost seven seasons of The Walking Dead, I ve become desensitized to graphic displays of violence and human innards. Like most modern movies, this film shows more gore than it has to, but I don t blame Mel Gibson because audiences have come to expect it. One could also argue that Doss s heroism is enhanced by his overcoming horrific violence, explosions, and flamethrower carnage.\n\nGREG: Doss is an extraordinary hero. He went into battle without a weapon. Then, when all the other soldiers had left the battlefield, Doss went back and single-handedly, one-by-one lowered 75 wounded men from a cliff over 12 hours. He had to overcome his fears and ignore his fatigue. The men in his unit considered what he did a miracle. So much so, that they refused to go into battle again the next day unless he went with them. It s a remarkable hero s journey. We see some mentors in Doss s life, not all of them positive. His father is a very negative mentor. Scott, we often talk about dark mentors (people who lead a hero down the wrong path). But Doss s father represents what we ve come to know as the anti-mentor. This is a person who leads the hero down a path by showing the counter-example. Doss s father was so abusive that it caused Doss to vow never to touch a gun. That was just as powerful a mentoring as any positive mentor.\n\nSCOTT: Yes, but Doss s father also redeems himself by using his connections to help Doss avoid court martial. We don t see very many redeemed anti-mentors in the movies. But we do see many instances of parents who play a pivotal mentoring role in either a child s heroism or villainy. This year s The Accountant is a recent example. It s interesting that Doss is a great hero because he not only transforms himself, he transforms others. At the end of the movie, several soldiers approach him sheepishly, admitting to Doss that they were wrong about him and asking him for forgiveness. The men Doss served with are forever inspired by Doss and transformed by serving with him. The man who first identified the various stages of the hero s journey, Joseph Campbell, argued that the hero s positive influence on other is the ultimate culmination of the hero s journey.\n\nGREG: Hacksaw Ridges is a powerful tribute to a pacifist hero. While the film was grisly at times, it made the case for a conscientious objector who made a difference. The movie gets off to a slow start - giving us a lot of backstory of Doss s early life. I was also thrown off by the frequent flashbacks. But the thrilling climax makes up for any problems in pacing. I was shocked at first by the gore, but I recovered enough to enjoy the story. I give Hacksaw Ridge 4 out of 5 Reels. Doss is an unlikely hero. As a pacifist with a religious objection to carrying a gun, he has to show his devotion to his country and to his comrades in other ways. When he looks past his own safety and fatigue to rescue the men in his battalion, he exposes his true heroic nature. He is the epitome of the selfless hero. I give Desmond Doss 5 out of 5 Heroes. Once again we are met with a number of lesser mentors. Doss s father represents an anti-mentor who shows Doss a path by his counter example. And I consider his drill sergeant a dark mentor since he derides Doss and gives tacit permission for the other men to abuse Doss. I give these mentors just 3 out of 5 Mentor points.  Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Greg, you nailed it. Hacksaw Ridge is a must-see movie. You just don t encounter a better example of heroism than this, a form of heroism that is packed with off-the-charts selflessness and profound moral conviction. I prefer the term Doss uses to describe himself: A conscientious cooperator more than a conscientious objector. He wants to serve in the military, but only on his pacifistic terms. Heroes who stand up to social pressure to do the right thing, and who risk their lives to save others, are our most powerful heroes. I give Hacksaw Ridge 5 Reels out of 5. The hero s journey is also potent, and it is broken up into two separate journeys. The first half of the film details Doss s ordeal at basic training, during which Doss is thrown into the dangerous world of the dissenter who dares to defy the military convention to use weaponry. In this hero s journey, Doss s only ally is his father, a broken man who redeems himself by helping Doss pass basic training and get shipped to Okinawa. At Okinawa, Doss s second hero s journey emerges, one that propels him into brutal combat while he saves 75 men with Japanese sharpshooters all around him. These are two powerful journeys, earning Doss 5 shining Hero points out of 5. I see a bit more mentoring going on than you do, Greg. Besides the dark mentoring of his father and sergeant, let s not forget the ultimate mentor, God, whose divine presence is repeatedly guiding and supporting Doss during his darkest moments. Whether you believe in God or not, there is no denying that Doss relied on Him to get him through all his travails. I give these mentors 4 Mentor points out of 5. Reels: Mentors: Heroes:",

            "content": "Mel Gibson returns to bring one of the greatest war and extreme commitment movies of all time!\n\nBased of the conflict on Okinawa island in 1945, to secure it for an airbase for the invasion of mainland Japan. U.S. troops had to scale the 400-foot cliff face named Maeda Escarpment, also known as \"Hacksaw Ridge\" to the Americans. The Japanese troops had been there for years preparing for the war. The entire island was one massive camouflaged tunnel, trench, or trap of some sort. Climbing that cliff face, the Americans were immediately met with heavy and direct machine gun, mortar, grenade, and small arms rifle fire.\n\nThe movie is not one for the faint hearted, whereas the very first scene of the film is that of blood, bodies, severed limbs and rotting death. Mel Gibson returns to bring one of the greatest war and extreme commitment movies of all time! The strengths and unimaginable resolve Desmond Doss displays throughout this movie in his faith, romantic love, overcoming bullies and war itself, is unfounded. The previous Great War movie, \"Saving Private Ryan\", would be child's play in terms of gore and combat imagery contained within \"Hacksaw Ridge\". If you ever imagined what war would be like, this movie will give you a very good insight.\n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a very faithful Seventh-day Adventist from Virginia, who grew up in an abusive household. His father (Hugo Weaving) who fought in WWI, now has PTSD, drowns himself in alcohol to cope with the loss of his fellow soldiers and takes his aggression out on his wife and children. Desmond is a conscientious objector, or a 'conscientious cooperator' as he calls himself due to him volunteering for the Army. Enlisting as a Medic, because of his strict convections to God, he'll never has to touch a weapon; or so he thinks.\n\nHis father is the first to try and persuade Desmond from serving. His brother who shows up to dinner in his uniform, shortly after enlisting in the Army Infantry, strikes a nerve with his father. He begins to relive the horrible scene when his best friend in France was shot in the back, 'blowing his intestines out the front, awful everywhere'. He is so distraught that he tells his son to get out of his sight. Doss later meets his father at the cemetery where he's standing above his friends who were killed in action. He tells Doss that \"everybody else jumps in and does things without thinking. Soldiers who live, they live because they can do that, you can't! You have to sit there, think and pray about everything\". Doss tells his father that he wouldn't be able to live with himself if he didn't enlist.\n\nHis conviction to his God and the duty to serve are tested quickly from the moment Doss arrives at basic training. He is met with hate, disrespect, hazing, and judgement by his fellow soldiers; even his Captain (Sam Worthington) and Sergeant (Vince Vaughn) partake in the abuse, when they find out he's a conscientious objector. Most of the men turn against him, belittle him for his beliefs, brand him a coward, and beat him severely because if it. Doss barely makes it through training alive and out of a prison sentence, after facing a Court Martial for disobeying a direct order - the refusal to pick up a rifle and train.\n\nFalling in love with Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) before leaving for Army basic training, his love for her is tested in the Court Martial confinement cell. While visiting Doss, his fianc\u00e9 pleads with him to find another way 'who you going to save in prison? Pick up the gun and wave it around. Meet them half way'. Remaining steadfast in his conviction he won't break Gods' commandment of 'Thou Shalt Not Kill' and to himself to do his duty to his country. In a very lose-lose situation, he finds himself in front of the Judge Advocate for his case. Narrowly escaping a long prison sentence, his father returns to deliver a letter that ultimately frees Doss so that he can continue his training.\n\nEverything would change drastically when they land on Okinawa, to scale \"Hacksaw Ridge\", and conquer the island. Every one of those men who beat, belittled, and swore that he would get more soldiers killed were biting their tongues when he saved each and every one of them on top of that ridge. When most of his company retreated down the cliff after being overran, calling in Naval Gunfire on their own positions, Desmond remained at the top. He could have easily gone down with his men and been safe at base camp, but he remained.\n\nThe amount of extreme commitment, not only to his fellow soldiers on that mountain but also to God, to accomplish his goal to see that each one of them would return to their families. Reaching his breaking point, Doss holds his best friend dying in his arms \"I don't understand. I can't hear you\" he hears the cries \"MEDIC!!\" and returns into the smoke and bombing to retrieve his fallen comrades. Hands torn, bloodied and rope burned \"Lord, help me get one more\" Doss repeats, as he goes on to send over 75 men, both American and Japanese, over \"Hacksaw Ridge\" to be rescued. This eventually led him to being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, the first ever conscientious objector to do so.*\n\nThe ability to remain so dedicated throughout everything Doss endures in this movie really moves you. The comradeship and bravery is astounding throughout the entire movie. Even if Doss isn't willing to kill another human being, he surely shows that he is willing to die for his convictions and to protect his fellow brother. This is made apparent by disobeying another direct order to retreat, as Naval gunfire bombs the ridge, to go back and save his fellow soldiers time after time.\n\nAn intense look into war, commitment, and the ability to prove everyone wrong. Just as Doss' father had a different outlook on life after WWI, expect to have that same feeling when you finish \"Hacksaw Ridge\"!\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\n*Thomas William Bennett and Joseph Guy LaPointe Jr. would both receive a MoH posthumously, for separate actions, while serving as an Army Medics during the Vietnam War.",

            "content": "After I saw \"The Social Network\" for the first time, I knew Andrew Garfield would become a terrific actor. I looked at him as a serious actor with the ability to impress his viewers with dramatic scenes of intensity and good heartiness. I felt he fell into the trap of the Marvel Universe with the Amazing Spider-man films as he did not bring anything special to the character of Peter Parker. Granted the mediocre scripts and overabundance of cartoon-ish CGI did not help Mr. Garfield but even so, his dominance was lacking. He returned to the dramatic role with 2014's underrated \"99 Homes,\" where he plays a father trying to support his family during the recession. It was a great movie that brought Mr. Garfield back into playing field which would eventually lead to \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" an incredible true story of a pacifist's legacy on the battlefield during World War II.\n\nThe movie follows the life of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a conscientious objector who served as an army medic during the Battle of Hacksaw Ridge on Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battles during World War II. Due to Doss' strong beliefs, he was the only soldier during the war who went into battle without a weapon. This is something that his fellow soldiers looked down on and tried to push (and sometimes punch) Doss out of the army. Though even with all the bruises, threats, and potential jail time, Doss stood by his religious and moral beliefs and was able to enter the war and stand by his brothers-in-arms.\n\nThe Battle of Hacksaw Ridge is one of the greatest set pieces - as well as one of the bloodiest - in the history of film. Director Mel Gibson, receiving a nomination for his outstanding work, delivers an intense, graphic interpretation of the bloodiest battle of World War II. Soldiers on both sides are torn to shreds by bullets, shrapnel, artillery, and suicide soldiers with grenades. The film reminds me of Mel Gibson's \"We Were Soldiers,\" a war film set during  in Vietnam where blood and gore were not wasted. While \"We Were Soldiers\" have too much excessive gore, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" does it to gives us an insight to what Doss was looking at throughout the battle.\n\nWhile the battle is a fantastic, edge-of-your-seat masterpiece, the real tense moments of the film come in the aftermath. After the U.S. army retreats from the ridge after being overrun by the Japanese, Doss stays and continues to send down injured U.S. and enemy soldiers to the medics down below. Throughout the night, Doss rescued and securely lowered 75 soldiers without firing a weapon - the act of heroism that left his fellow soldiers (some of whom did not believe Doss should remain in the military) both shocked and amazed by his actions.\n\nObviously, a great film cannot be complete without a terrific lead and Andrew Garfield was fantastic. Receiving a nomination for his role, Mr. Garfield plays the hero perfectly. Doss is a kind but serious young man who puts himself before others while not resulting to violence. In one scene, Doss says he took the attack on Pearl Harbor personally. Yet throughout the film, he does not fire a weapon. A true hero who believed that he could win a war by sending wounded soldiers home instead of letting them die on the battlefield. This mindset is brought to life by Mr. Garfield's terrific performance. I hope he continues with his dramatic roles for the rest of his career and hopefully see him on that stage with an Oscar in his hand.\n\nSay what you want about Mel Gibson's personal life but \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is the director at his best. Bloody, violent, and relentless, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is one of the greatest war films ever made.\n\nGrade: A",

            "content": "Charging forth with a pacifist war story that's anything but passive, director Mel Gibson channels the vicious punch and visceral panache of some vaulted war films from H'Wood's past in telling the story of one very Brave Heart who's Passion for the Christ found him sticking to his religious, er, guns during one of World War II's deadliest skirmishes. \n\nIn this R-rated war movie, pacifist WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) refuses to kill people during the Battle of Okinawa and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot. Sporting a hard R rating, the film unapologetically pains a very bloody picture. Ironically and unsurprisingly skewing more toward the War is Hell mantra (made famous as the memoir title of another unlikely WWII underdog hero, Audie Murphy) than, say, one that proselytizes Peace is Heaven, this film's title says everything about its tone: Hacksaw Ridge. The ironic part arises from the fact that it's a story about pacifist convictions. The unsurprising part stems from the fact that it comes courtesy of a man made iconic by ultra-violent actioner Lethal Weapon, an artist who (kinda, sorta) also made 'historic' filmic violence iconic with Braveheart. To this end, there's two reasons why it wasn't titled The Desmond Doss Story. Due to the extreme but strategic use of violence, he film proves both a thoughtful rumination on the duality of man that's as much a statement by Gibson as Doss. For better and worse, Gibson zeroes in on two flicks for inspiration: Full Metal Jacket and Saving Private Ryan (All Quiet on the Western Front doubtlessly is another but many will miss the  connection given that, at 87 years old, that film as a cultural touchstone has timed out for anybody but film historians). The better? Hacksaw Ridge comes way closer than most to equaling the gut punch realism of these modern war classics, serving up a demoralizing boot camp segment that would make Jacket's R. Lee Emery's Drill Sgt. proud (Vince Vaughn, in a surprising but rewarding casting choice, believably doles out the vitriol) and setting the second half in an embattled Pacific warzone (amphibious landing, body count, jettisoned limbs, and all) that sometimes looks like Ryan Normandy Beach scenes picked up from the cutting room floor. The worse? The telltale stylistic beats 'borrowed' from these films can't be missed. Still, if Gibson hadn't already earned a place as a vaunted director with Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ, Hacksaw Ridge almost ensures him entry. The most expensive independent movie of all time (in his heyday, Gibson could get a Mother Theresa snuff film financed with one phone call but, post 2010 public meltdown amid a fickle film industry, he had to piece together financiers like a Shark Tank contestant) delivers a remarkable and well-shot true story. \n\nSticking to your guns - even when sticking to your guns specifically involves sticking to no guns - becomes more than a religious argument. It sets fire to a contentious conversation about a public trying to peacefully go about their day despite mass shootings being an almost weekly occurrence. Destined for Direct-to-Video status after The Amazing Spider-Man series toppled into oblivion, Andrew Garfield gives a layered and nuanced performance. It's not enough that he believably embodies the belief system of Desmond Doss's pacifist, he also looks and acts every bit like the simple - though not simpleton - farmer. As he's proven with Apocalypto and every film he's directed involving armed conflict (and, saved for Man Without a Face, they all do), Gibson puts forth a contemplative message saying peace is better than war but, ultimately, violence as an ends-to-a-means is often unavoidable ...or so it seems. Perhaps, the title of Lethal Weapon was simply hailing the coming of a cinematic realist. \n\nTo Sum it Up: Soldier of Good Fortune",

His films have never had a light touch, especially when it comes to his adored savior figures, and this movie is no exception. There is actually a pretty damn good war movie hidden in here... unfortunately, you have to sit through an hour of sap and melodrama to get to it. The problem with this film is that it's two films smashed together: one is a character drama about how saintly and pious Desmond Doss becomes saintly and pious, even in the army; and the other is a balls-out uber-violent bloodbath of a war movie. The first part sucks, the second is pretty awesome. So let's start with the first half - it is so unbelievably saccharine it made my teeth hurt. The protagonist is such a goddamn boy scout, the movie may as well have been called \"Mr. Smith Goes to War\".  Even the talented Andrew Garfield, who I am a big fan of, could not make him believable (luckily, in spite of this, Garfield's undeniable charisma makes us root for him anyway). And it's not just him, all the characters in this film suffer from two-dimensionality, and the film's cheeseball dialogue and dramatic swells of music don't help the situation. It's all so predictable. And then there is the sad, unforgivable imitation of Full Metal Jacket's infamous bootcamp scene, which was literally painful to watch. It's just offensive. By the midpoint, I was barely hanging on, trying to hold on to what little interest I had in this film and then HOLY SHIT IT'S A WAR MOVIE AAAAIIGHHHH!!! At that point, shit gets real, and fast. The juxtaposition of the horror, grit, and gore of this half with the sallow tepidness of the first is as shocking as a smack in the face. But at least the second half is effective. It's here that you really start to care about the characters, even the ones with very little screen time, which just shows that all the time spent up to that point was wasted on a back-story that wasn't important or necessary. Sadly, the film returns to its melodramatic roots at the end, which weakens the emotional punch of the second half and cheapens the story as a whole. And the story is a pretty amazing one, regardless of all the missteps in the telling, and one that really hits home when you see a few of the real-life interviews at the end (I wish there were more). I give the first half of this movie a D and the second a B+.",

However I was immensely affected by viewing this film even if on a TV screen.\nThe film is directed by Mel Gibson. A man who has directed several films already don't get me wrong but must be redeeming his faded reputation with work like this.\nThe screenplay importantly is about a conscientious objector Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield who I last saw in Martin Scorseses long winded Silence) who serves in the U.S. army in the Second World War on the gruesome battlefield of Hacksaw Ridge against the Japanese.\nDoss's is a highly religious man and his beliefs which he sticks to 'religiously' mean he faces training being unwilling to carry and use a gun.\nFor his beliefs Doss faces great unease from his comrades and senior officers who do everything in their power to make Doss quit service before active duty on the battlefield. Doss even facing a Court Martial at one stage.\nHowever Doss resolutely refuses to quit. His explanation being that he must 'serve' his country reeling from the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese.\nAll Doss wants to do is serve using his medical skills.\nSomehow Doss survives discharge and enters the battlefield at the Battle of Okinawa against the Japanese.\nThe battle scenes as the U.S. attempt to capture a ridge called Hacksaw Ridge are quite alarming in their brutality.\nI thought that the latest Rambo film was the most gory I have ever seen but think again.\nThe battlefield scenes make Saving Private Ryan (which I have watched in part) look like a tea party.\nI was quite alarmed by the brutality to be honest. However it brought the horrors of such fist to fist conflict (or gun and knife) home.\nDoss still refuses to even defend himself. I would not call it murder and at the start of the battle scenes I probably shared the rather Conservative views of the Officers that Doss service was more of a hinderance. Putting his comrades at risk.\nHowever Doss becomes an unlikely hero as he provides first aid to the wounded and single handedly rescues several (estimated at 75) to the relative safety behind the forefront of the battle lines.\nWe learn that Doss receives the greatest military honour that the U.S. awards the Medal of Honor.\nOld interview footage from the early 2000s interviews the original characters depicted in the film before their death.\nThe film making is top notch. I've already mentioned the Director but mention must also go to the cinematography and special effects department to make the battle scenes so horrifically realistic.\nMy own view of Doss changed like his comrades I suppose. From being totally questioning his (Doss) stubborn stance.\nThe film is more than your average depiction of the Second World War horrors but a biographical triumph.",

            "content": "Like a lot of war movies strangely seem to do, Hacksaw Ridge is sort of split into two parts.  The first half is getting to know this guy, who he is, and why he is the way he is.  It plays off a little cheesy, and the romance comes off with him seeming like a bit of a creeper, but these almost seem like stylistic choices.  It gives it sort of a romanticized old-school Hollywood feeling.  It also creates a more dramatic contrast to the war scenes, and that's where this movie goes from pretty good to godamn genius.\nRight from the start of the war scenes, you feel the tension.  The way the tension works, building up a feeling of uneasiness that climaxes in moments of outrageous brutality, it's unlike any other war movie I've seen.  It doesn't even feel like a war movie, it feels more like a horror movie in it's style, pacing, and directing.  The scenes of them in the fog of climbing up the ridge to the battlefield are probably the films strongest moments.  The music and the directing just make the suspense of these people willingly going to a place where they are probably going to die downright unbearable.  And then there's the violence, oh the violence.  First of all, yes it's gory and horrible, but based on what I've heard from real vets about our war movies it probably still doesn't reach the whole thing.  Second, a lot of people say the violence is romanticized and takes away from the movies message of peace.  Maybe they were watching a different movie, because I don't see that at all.  The violence isn't glorified, it's horrified.  It doesn't show the glory in taking lives, but rather the glory in saving lives, which was the what our lead characters whole deal was, a pacifist in war who just wanted to save lives in a time when people were purely focused on taking them.  It works really well, and it's point is made clear.  It doesn't demonize the effects of war and the soldiers who are actually fighting either though, it just shows that the reality that exists. It's powerfully effective and for a war film manages to get by without any real villain, aside from the very concept of conflict I guess.\nIn my first viewing of this movie, I had my problems with the earlier scenes.  They were a little too whimsical and exaggerated for my liking.  Now having seen the whole film, I understand their purpose to put you in a head-space where the films point can truly come across.  It's a damn powerful movie, one of the best war movies I've ever seen.  Extremely effective and highly engaging, it's a near-masterpiece.",

This makes me think that watching a documentary about Desmond Doss would be much more engaging and rewarding than this over rated movie (I say that as a Mel Gibson fan) The first hour of the movie is about Desmond Doss's home life and it is super cheesy and predictable to the point of being almost 2 dimensional. The story arch's of the characters are linear and predictable also. The second hour of the movie is about Desmond Doss's military achievement. This really saves the movie and makes it worth while but there are still unsatisfactory elements. I think this movie was badly cast. Some of the acting is really awful and some of the actors did not suit their roles. The dialouge is also predictable and cheesy at times. The realities of war and the unique story of Desmond Doss are enough to hold this story together as an etertainment spectacle however the movie itself is grossly over rated.",

The battle scenes in Hacksaw Ridge are among the most intense and graphic captured on film. Arguably one upping the infamous D-Day sequence in Saving Private Ryan.

His road to the battlefield to serve as a medic is filled with hate and bullying but you already know he will get his \"revenge\" and stand as the true hero in the end.\n\nPlenty of war-action but also a solid background story - the balance is just fine. Some silly war scenes and I never like the bible stuff. The praying scene is pretty dumb, some other scenes are also a bit sketchy. When he is towed down and it oozes of CGI and some angel infused message I felt it was a bit too much. The mix of ethics of war and religion never favor the film, really. I never really like the area where the battles takes place either. Climbing the net, knowing there will be loads of Japanese there - it's like a neverending computer game. I doubt it was like that in reality, but I believe the producers choice of making something special of it was a cool idea that almost worked out.\n\nIt takes well care of the viewer. It's never flat or boring, never dragged out and rearly too silly. Not the deepest of films, but it works out as a entertaining piece. Well acted, even Vince Vaughn impresses me. It's lovely shot, without trying to be too fancy. Ugly enough action combined with typical Oscar material works out. Not seen many of the Oscar participants yet, but I believe it won't win more than one award.\n\n6.5 out of 10 morphine shots.",

So he goes on to the battlefield against the Japanese with no gun. His intention is to save peoples lives. Not since Saving Private Ryan have we got a war film that is so emotionally captivating. From the opening scene, I knew that this movie was going to have something special, and it did. I was floored by Hacksaw Ridge. There was not a single thing wrong with it. Everyone who played in it did a remarkable. Mel Gibson is back at it again with another good movie. This is proof that Gibson still has it. The war scenes were well choreographed, and violent. I hate it when people say \"Its too gory\". It's WW2, what else would you expect? What got me was watching this character achieving what he intended to do. It almost brought me to tears. At one point, I thought that I was going to cry because the movie was that good.\nOver all, this film was remarkable. It is sure to be a classic in the future. 5/5 stars",

I wish there were more interpersonal struggles between characters and more time spent on his recusing all those people from the ridge such as more close calls with the opposing side and more perilous situations like when he went into that cave system. I didn't really connect with the characters of the other soldiers either even the main side soldier character who died before getting to the edge of the ridge. What I liked least about the movie, however, was who was cast as the main character. Sure he had had a go at the Virginia accent and Bible talk but he is so obnoxious to look at.

Some takes on it-and more so, certain elements encapsulated within those views-are likely philosophically self-reverential and a demonstration of current modern angst toward what those individuals may term as traditionalism, but I see the film's structure and character development rather differently.\n\nDoes the director (Mel Gibson) use a hand that is too heavy in any way?  I do not believe so at all.  Filmmakers the likes of Oliver Stone and James Cameron tend to bludgeon one over the head.  Mr. Gibson is not really of the same cloth.  While in Hacksaw Ridge he was clearly acknowledging that what Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) did was miraculous in and of itself, he was also allowing for the view that Mr. Doss himself had toward prayer, faith and divinity.  Such was clearly part of the man and the film is simply being honest in presenting that.  The viewer may take from it what the viewer will, but I say HACKSAW RIDGE is an excellent example of exemplary film-making.\n\nMy father was a Marine and Okinawa was the location of his deployment.  He was seriously wounded there and wasn't expected to live, but he did.  Then he wasn't expected to walk again, but he did.  He then went on to live a life of hard physical labor.  He was a man whom I will always hold in deep love and respect.  When I was a small child I used touch his wounds--which were all over his stomach, side, lower back and buttocks--and ask what they were.  He would just tell me that they were wounds from a war.  When I got older he described circumstances on Okinawa to me in more detail (though he was never verbose about it) and they were strikingly similar to those depicted in HACKSAW RIDGE.\n\nThe movie is certainly not easy to watch at times, but it is quite thought-provoking and most affecting.  And those who know of the situation on that island at that time will find it quite realistic.",

This demonstrates that wanting to be a medic shouldn't be limited to only select races. Everyone deserves a second chance in life even if they were monsters.

This is in  contrast to Eastwood's Letters to Iwo Jima which offers more substance and less filler. All the same, it's an absolute must see for war picture advocates.

But, I decided perhaps he has atoned for his drunken tirade and his movies need not be boycotted by me any longer.  Plus, I like a good war flick.  The story itself is undeniably compelling and frankly miraculous.  What the man achieved on his own and how he stuck to his beliefs are made for Hollywood - if it was written nobody would believe it.  And I feel like that's where the movie misses the mark - even with the graphic, visceral war scenes, this movie feels like a it's shot on a soundstage.  It didn't transport me to Okinawa the way Saving Private Ryan took us along on D-Day.  The casting of Vince Vaughn as the Sarge and Hugo Wallace Weaving as the protagonist's father are curious choices.  Perhaps it was simply a matter of who is willing to work with Mr. Gibson.  The movie spends a lot of time pre-battle establishing the backstory that formed the beliefs and character of Desmond Doss.  Kind of snoozy but the lading lady Teresa Palmer is a compelling actress and easy on the eyes, and she basically carries the first half of the film. The second half chronicles the bravery of Desmond in the heat of a ferocious battle with Japanese soldiers who are literally dug in on top of Hacksaw Ridge.  Where it's supposed to be fear inducing and intense, it feels like the foxholes are on the backlot.  It's a true story - so there are inherent challenges in sticking to a true story.  Using Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now as the gold standard of war films, and Saving Private Ryan as Silver (loosely based on a true story), I'd give this a bronze in the war film category.  As a true war story, which is its own category, it's very good, most importantly for putting the spotlight on one man's incredible bravery and service to his fellow comrades in the face of grave danger, a feat worth honoring and remembering.",

His latest feature is a beautiful outing that proves that all a faith-based film needs to work for everyone, religious or not, is a sense of heart and a general respect towards universal human values. Through thick and thin, Desmond Doss perseveres with every fiber of his being: in his case, it's faith that guides him in particular, but it shows that just caring about our fellow humans really can make a difference. So much of why Doss works as a character is the way Andrew Garfield portrays him: with a heavy Virginian accent and a boyish charm, he's an immediately loveable soul, and you immediately relate to his unfaltering desire to \"save one more.\" This is far and away some of Garfield's finest work as an actor. Gibson himself proves that not even a decade long hiatus has weakened his sensibilities as a director. The juxtaposition of a faith-based story against the sheer brutality of World War II is almost poetic, all without the violence ever seeming gratuitous. The battle sequences in the second half are certainly gruesome (the squeamish should probably avoid this one), but it never feels like it's there for shock value or to try to push boundaries of how graphic a film can get: it's simply an extension of the themes of this utterly beautiful story of the human spirit.",

When you think about a direct relationship between The Passion of Christ, Braveheart and Apocalypto is not only about the violence itself, but about the connection between faith, freedom, will during extreme circumtances.\n\nDesmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) grown in Lynchburg, Virginia becomes a pacifist after a traumatic event which almost make his brother kill. The experience drive him to believe in a non violence attitude, after years witnessing the abuse of his father Tom Doss (Hugo Weaving) against his mother he consider that he is the right path to follow.\n\nLater he decided to enlist inn the army, brining this controversial beliefs causing hate, disrespect and also court martial from his colleagues in the Army. The case was dismiss after his father prove that Doss is protected by an Act of Congress by been a pacifist. \n\nDoss goes to Okinawa with the 77th Infantry Division without a weapon, just to help in the medical area. \n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is Mel Gibson's most recent film about the life Desmond Doss, the movie contains one of the most impressive actions scenes, but also the most brutal and gory. The film explores the irony of war and violence while you having the most peaceful person in it. Every time you see a major character been hurt or killed Gibson sends you a message that nothing is for granted, when it comes to the act of war. The violence in \"Hacksaw Ridge\" borderline in Quentin Tarantino, where caricatures-cue blood and action becomes an ode to thirsty audience who just want to see everyone been blown away or hurt really bad. Gibson explore those acts of violence and make you understand about the ramifications of defend your honor besides your beliefs. The movie also borderline into the corny from Desmond love story to his relationship with his family.  \n\nThe cast do a formidable job and the film is visually stunning, with amazing technical achievements in sound, cinematography and post production",

            "content": "It's hard to believe that Apocalypto in 2006 was the last time Mel Gibson was behind the camera. I suppose 10 years in movie-making exile is where antisemitic rants gets you in Hollywood. That aside, it's a pleasure to see Gibson directing again as he often delivers big, entertaining spectacles and his latest certainly falls into line with that.\n\nPlot: The true story of private Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) who joins the army during WWII but refuses to bear arms due to being a conscientious objector. At the battle of Okinawa, Doss serves as a medic, saving numerous lives and becomes the first man in history to win a Medal of Honor without ever firing a gun. \n\nIf you consider the material of Hacksaw Ridge, you might notice that's it ripe material for Mel Gibson and his personal beliefs. As a man who has\nbeen very outspoken (a bit too much) on his Christian values, this film seems like the perfect vehicle for him to channel these beliefs. Faith and religion course throughout this and, as much as you can may want to overlook it, it just won't let you. This is a film about a saviour and it can't help but bombard you with religious rhetoric and imagery. In the end, you could ask where God is in all this bloodshed and mayhem but that might be a tad too philosophical for what Gibson is going for here.\n\nSadly, that's what's missing from Hacksaw Ridge; Its jingoism feels out of touch and I couldn't help but wonder what, say, Terrence Malick might have done with the material. If you consider Malick's The Thin Red Line, for example, you'll find a philosophical depth that's lacking from Gibson's film yet it would have benefited greatly from.\n\nThere's also a contradictory nature; Despite feeling like an old-fashioned, Hollywood style picture it has many riffs and rip-off's of contemporary war movies. There are several unashamed nods to Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan and Gibson's own Braveheart and Hacksaw's major problem is that it doesn't come close to bettering any of them.\n\nI'm also not sold on the choice of leading man; Andrew Garfield is not a bad actor by any means but he doesn't deliver a performance that's worthy of the Oscar nomination he's received for this. I don't know, maybe it's just his appearance that throws me off. He's too boyish or maybe it's just that I can't help but focus on how disproportionate his hair is to his face. It's not the first time in a film that I've noticed his monumentally large hair. It's very distracting.\n\nThat said, despite its cliches and sometimes woefully written dialogue, this still has much to offer in terms of entertainment and it's a pleasure to see Gibson calling the shots with his usual visceral approach. He still has a ferocious ability to stage a good action set-piece and Hacksaw provides a good number of them.\n\nAlthough old sugar tits just can't help but put his Christian values and themes of religious devotion into this, it's hard not to be swept up in the combat and the man behind the astounding true story. It's not subtle storytelling from Gibson but it's simple and effective nonetheless.\n\nMark Walker",

You can argue that many details are \"irrelevant\" and giving them the hollywood treatment makes for a better movie experience, but for me it was unnecessary - and even, in some cases to the detriment of Doss' well deserved legend.  For example, after 12 hours rescuing some 50-75 men, he is ultimately blown up by a grenade from which he saved his comrades, but then - riddled with shrapnel - he still crawled off his stretcher and gave it up to another injured man, in the process having his arm shattered by sniper fire.  This is cut out and should have been the icing on the cake.  Yet somehow Gibson decided this was unimportant? Why? Quite clearly he wants to present what happened to Doss as a genuine real-life miracle - no question Doss survived 12 hours under heavy fire and was able to rescue half of his platoon single-handed without injury which is borderline miraculous.  But the fact that he subsequently was blown up by a grenade and then shot renders him \"only human\" and diminishes Gibson's \"miracle man\" vision, which I think is unforgivable on Gibson's part.\nDoss' true life story is one of immense human courage, and the fact that he paid a hard price for it only increases his legend in my eyes.  Gibson in his religious fervour short changes us and Doss.  \nMoving in parts and I am grateful for being introduced to Doss' story as it is incredible - but for me it fails, revelling in the current trend for \"alternate facts\" which apparently are always better than the truth - as long as they serve your agenda.",

This film disturbed me, haunted me, and sent shivers down my spine during its many lengthy battle sequences, which were shot with gruesome realism and likened to that of a horror movie with heavy emphasis on the expression: war is hell. The story follows real-life army medic, Desmond Doss, who was a conscientious objector to violence due to some elements of his past, and through faith and unwavering courage, decides to enlist in the army to save lives, rather than take them. His journey takes him to the infamous battle of Okinawa, where the Americans fought the ruthless Japanese soldiers and though many lives were lost, Desmond managed to save approximately 75 wounded soldiers without firing a single bullet. Andrew Garfield gives the performance of his career as Doss, a simple-minded, but determined-as-hell lover, rather than fighter, whose spirituality gets him through his considerable obstacles in the army. He is ridiculed, beaten, and named a coward for his non-violent tendencies, leading to harsh treatment from his peers throughout boot camp. The supporting cast is also excellent here with Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Luke Bracey giving career-best performances as fellow soldiers, and a nearly unrecognizable Hugo Weaving was OUTSTANDING as Desmond's alcoholic veteran father; whose biggest fear is having his sons buried before him. All that said, Mel Gibson is the true star of the show here and it is wonderful to see him being embraced back into the public consciousness thanks to this incredibly powerful and assured film. Hacksaw Ridge is the best war film since Saving Private Ryan, and the impact this film carries left me in complete, stunned silence once it ended.",

I see Saving Private Ryan as the definitive World War II film. The battles in this movie were comparably shot, maybe more cinematic as opposed to live action, but the comparisons stop there. What shines through the most in this film heart, the triumphant glory we normally see reserved for sports films. While Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington pleasantly surprised me, Garfield's performance really carried the picture. The story builds without dragging, despite the fact that we don't even get to Okinawa until more than halfway through. As they say on South Park, \"Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but that son of a b**** knows story structure.\" 8.8/10",

The story of this brave medic saving his troops is just beyond heroic and extraordinary - simply inspirational in all aspects. The pacing of the film was really good and I enjoyed the back story but once the battle sequences started, boy were they phenomenal. It was beautifully shot. The cinematography, the script, the cast, the performances, and the score was just superb. The only thing I regret is not catching this film at an Atmos theater - OMG it sounds so AMAZING. Bombardments were heavy and loud, gave me new sub an amazing workout - WOW!!! I can see now why this movie won an academy for sound and rightfully so and well deserved. Simply excellent!!! Some may say it was too violent, too extreme or too gruesome, but it's war and nothing in the battlefield is anything less so I was okay with it. Definitely not for the faint of heart. I gotta say Mel Gibson knocked this one out the park. I had my doubts when I heard Mel to maybe direct the Suicide Sequel, I said \"NOOOO\" - I take that back let him direct it.  Anyhow back to my review, Hacksaw Ridge is on the level of one of my all-time favorite war films - Saving Private Ryan. This is an instant classic and it truly is an impactful film.

If there was any thought that perhaps Gibson would soften after spending years away due to his several explosive temper tantrums, do not have that thought for very long. The battle scenes in \"Hacksaw Ridge\" are among the most intense captured on film. However this film is not simply a war film, but this unrelenting honest portrayal of war is balanced with a pacifist medic who refuses to carry a gun into battle. This juxtaposition of medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and his decision to not carry a weapon and his subsequent heroic actions that saves 75 soldiers matter all the more because we see the true horror of war. \nIf the opening scene of \"Saving Private Ryan\" dropped viewers into the middle of war, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" does exactly the same. Soldiers are burned, shot, and stabbed. Blood washes over the screen in surges not leaving the viewers any room for imagination. This very gruesomeness of war is necessary for the storytelling to compare to the opposed innocent, reserved and good-hearted protagonist, Doss. Gibson very quickly is able to identify this stark contrast that continues as the film progresses. \nThe juxtaposition continues, as we are able to further grow to know Doss.  Desmond Doss refuses to pick up a weapon because of his religious beliefs that one should never kill. Still, he insists on serving his country and fellow men, and much to the surprise and disgust of some, Doss convinces the Army to send him overseas as a medic, with his Bible at his side, to serve in the gory thick of the Battle of Okinawa. Doss's resolution of religious commitment to his Sabbath and religion, alongside his perseverance in battle demonstrates two worlds colliding. \nWe are able to watch Doss and his battalion bravely climb up the rope ladder at Hacksaw Ridge that leads them into the jaws of death and true horror, and it is here that we are able to view the pivotal point of the film. Through the terror and realism of war, we are able to see Doss turning to God and praying to let him hear His voice. Immediately after this prayer is uttered, we hear the desperate cries of an injured soldier. It is through this scene that we are able to witness religion and battle uniting in a way that the conflict of religious sensibility and duty to warfare are able to coexist. \nMel Gibson as director of this film, being devoutly religious, yet unafraid of depicting the true grit of war, was able to bring contrasting worlds together into an epic film where both battle and religion play equal roles. Gibson's ability to share this story forces on the audience members a sense of responsibility and understanding of what it truly means to send people to war, as he should.  The film is able to act as an eye-opener to the harsh reality that too many are ignorant to, or often takes for granted. Through Gibson's unrelenting depiction of World War II, and the underlying theme of righteousness, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is able to uniquely accomplish far more than simply entertaining its viewers for a couple hours, but as an insight to a harsh reality of a true story full of unambiguous contrasts.",

Thanks to some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed, Gibson once again shows his staggering gifts as a filmmaker, able to juxtapose savagery with aching tenderness. Garfield melts into his Doss character in a performance that seems impossibly still and tranquil. He's mesmerizing. It's almost impossible to imagine he ever played Spider-Man. It's a movie about bravery and the power of inspiration, be it divine or corporeal, in moments of hopelessness. Desmond's faith is placed front and center, and the way it operates here celebrates not the object of that faith, but the power it has to motivate both Desmond and his squad. There's no doubt that this is confident, striking, film-making and if it merely serves as the final step in Gibson's rehabilitation and allows him to forge ahead with his new career as a director of true vision and power. The nightmarish battle scenes on Okinawa are masterfully handled, and include some of the most sickeningly violent sequences I've ever had to endure. Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best films of 2016. And the victory is all the more sweet for Gibson in that he succeeds on his own weird terms.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

Based on a true story but I would say loosely based and directed by Mel Gibson. I actually like his movies, despite what people view him as. While Passion of the Christ was good, I loved his work on Apocalypto. As far as I know, there isn't a movie like that where we get the idea of how the Mayans were and their little society.\n\nHacksaw Ridge is like no other, however, there is but of more exploration and involvement of the Pacific Operations. One I think that needs to be more explored than the European Theater of Operations. If you're a familiar with the history of World War II, then you should know what I'm talking about.\n\nAlthough there are movies, tv shows, and even video games that have explored the Pacific Operations. I feel there aren't enough of them to showcase audiences nowadays. Hacksaw Ridge is a huge example as to why we should.\n\nAndrew Garfield redeemed himself in this periodical war story of love, sacrifice, and the sense of duty that a soldier is willing to take to serve their very own country. Even Agent Smith a.k.a. Hugo Weaving. As well as Vince Vaughn, who I had no idea he was in the movie before I watched it.\n\nWar stories don't entertain but to give a lesson to each and every one of us. Sure, it's kinda inspirational, hearbreaking, and even admiring to say the least but showcasing how ugly war truly is, that's where it affects everyone in the whole world. Especially when it's World War. When you've got a story to witness like Hacksaw Ridge, it's always good to remind ourselves how war never changes.\n\nThe battle at the ridge itself is crazy and when you have Mel Gibson to direct, the depiction of a World War 2 battlefield is extreme. The scenes are what supposed to be and it's no joke that the Japanese Empire are quite brutal in the battlefield. But over that, Desmond Doss, the pacifist medic soldier, have saved many lives and it's unbelievable how he pulls it off. Although the movie may be in exaggeration on how it really went, it's no lie that he has survived through hell and even back.\n\nHacksaw Ridge is a good war movie and if you like me who likes to watch war stuff, especially WWII then I strongly recommend watching this.",

It's thrilling, masterfully handled battle scenes including sickening bloody sequences to endure but it does not lose its rhythm in telling vivid stories that evoke thoughts and intense feelings. Andrew Garfield is certainly a right choice as Desmond Doss, a military medics who saves 75 men without firing or carrying a gun through his impressive performance of breathtaking courageous acts.

True to form, Gibson unleashes hell in the battle scenes. You feel terror grip you as Doss tries to stay true to himself in the face of carnage, at the same time, you root for him as he draws strength from within to help his fellow soldiers.

It made me breathless: sitting up on the edge of my seat in awe of how gory yet stylized the shots and scenes were.\n- Everything related to the war and action scenes.  \n\nThe Not So Good:\n- The boring, banal, melodramatic, clich\u00e9d, dragged-on opening half of Hacksaw Ridge.  Nothing is rivetting or stimulating.  It's like guy with parent and family issues falls for a girl working in the amry and then enlists himself and becomes a hero.  *yawn* Bring on the BLOOD! \n- The religious elements and undertones thrust into the spotlight at the heavy handed \"required\" times.  I don't know why everything has to be religious orientated to Mel, but the linking factor with all of his films of late - Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ and even Braveheart - is religion.  Do something NEW and fresh, Mel.  Cause you do have some skills and gifts at directing.\n- Andrew Garfield.  I still don't understand how it got nominated for Best Actor.  To me, his performance was gangly, odd, uneven at best but mostly peculiar.  And I think his physical presence (i.e. his extradorinary long neck, and Gumby arms and torso) added to his portrayl's weirdness.  Along with the inconsistent accent.  Even with the real life clips of Desmond Doss shown at the end, the accept/non-normal speech of Doss was not any wear near successfully embodied by Garfield.\n- The general casting overall.  Why would you cast two non-American Actors - Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) and Rachel Griffiths (Brothers & Sisters; Six Feet Under) - as the Southern American parents of Garfield's American Doss? Where Weaving is the too overbearing and uber strict Dad and Griffiths is the too weak, tearful sappy mom (bad acting and direction from all three who could do better.  Maybe it's also the clich\u00e9 screenplay by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight).\nPlus Vince Vaughn as Sgt Howell?? A comic, comedian movie guy playing a \"serious\" army officer role?  Yeah. Sure.  That works.  NOT.  The only one that truly did do a decent acting job was English actor Sam Worthington as Captian Glover.\n\nLasting Remarks:\nMind blowing, eye popping war battle scenes and staging (hence the 3 stars) under cut by the hokum of its plot, script and acting.",

            "content": "Mel Gibson apparently never got the memo from Tinseltown. The man who was blacklisted by Hollywood has slowly, over the years, kept plugging away with various projects that could almost be seen as giant middle fingers to the industry. Its almost as if Gibson has upstaged Hollywood by displaying just how damn good of a director he actually is. You can almost feel the awkward shuffling in seats as the Hollywood top brass realise what they've been missing out on for the last ten years or so. Yes Mel is back with another corker, a biographical war epic based on actual events from the Battle of Okinawa, WWII, 1945. And yes its loaded with religious connotations as you would expect.\n\nSo briefly, based on the actual events in the life of one Desmond Doss, a Seventh-day Adventist from the state of Virginia. After getting into a scrap with his younger brother and nearly killing him by accident, Doss turns to his religion and completely renounces violence of any kind. Years later he meets up with Dorothy Schutte, a nurse at the local hospital. Doss slowly gets into a relationship with Schutte whilst slowly gaining an interest in medical procedures, helping the wounded. With the outbreak of war, both Doss and his brother enlist in the army much to the distress and anger of their father. Upon reaching boot camp in South Carolina Doss quickly discovers that his aversion to using any weapons based on his religious beliefs, does not go down well with his commanding officers or fellow recruits. \n\nAfter beatings and unfair abuse from his drill Sergeant (on orders from the commanding officer), Doss is eventually brought up on charges and pending a court martial. Luckily Desmond's father manages to avert his imprisonment with a letter from his old WWI buddy who is now a very high ranking officer. Doss is therefore allowed to train as a medic and go into battle as he pleases, unarmed. Its whilst in the thick of battle on the island of Okinawa that Doss displays great courage, strength and compassion for not only his fellow troops, but the enemy as well.\n\nSo lets just dive straight into the main crux of this movies story, the fact that Desmond Doss refused to carry, use or even touch a weapon because of his religious beliefs. Now apparently this is all pretty factual which amazes me frankly. I mean good on this guy for standing by his beliefs (God knows how that would go down these days) but holy bananas! I can see why his fellow recruits and officers grew so tired of his bullshit. All through the training sequences in this film I was frustrated, the fact that Doss refused to even touch a weapon just frustrated me. Not because I'm a gun loving lunatic but because I just couldn't get my head around the fact that this guy wouldn't hold a weapon. In peace times sure, understandable, but during WWII?! How the literal flip did this guy survive I just don't know. \n\nIn order to gain a pass for some leave every soldier is required to pass basic training, which included weapons training. Doss obviously hadn't completed this and is refused his leave pass by his commanding officer. Doss explains that he intends to get married on his leave and begs for the pass, but he is refused. Doss is told he can have his pass if he can just prove that he can handle and load a rifle...Doss refuses. I was like...DUDE!! TAKE THE GUN AND DO IT FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR WIFE!! Even when it came to facing a court martial (which I believe didn't actually happen, it never went that far), the man still wouldn't handle a weapon. His wife is there in tears as he sits in a military jail awaiting trial, his commanding officer and drill Sergeant all begging him to just hold a weapon, just once...and he still refused. I was literally biting chunks out of my sofa cushion. Yes there are principles but there is also a bit of common sense, come on!!\n\nLike other military flicks I actually found the training section of the film (at the start) the most engaging. Yes I know that might sound strange but meeting all the different soldiers we will be following, finding out what type of persons they are, meeting the predictably stern and shouty drill instructor and watching him abuse the men etc...its kinda fun. Its here I will give kudos to Vince Vaughn who gives us a wonderful performance that was totally unexpected. I never saw Vaughn in this type of role, never in a million years...and he's really good! OK sure the entire segment is essentially a complete rip-off from 'Full Metal Jacket' with the various soldiers and their silly nicknames. Plus Vaughn's drill Sergeant isn't a million miles away from R. Lee Ermey's drill Sergeant truth be told, but its all good and he's easily the best thing in the movie for me.\n\nThe actual war segments of the film, well half of the film, are of course the real meat and potatoes. Here we see the young Doss risking life and limb to save his fellow compadres from certain death, all the while without a weapon upon him. Its insane to actually think this guy actually did this, it almost seems like fiction to be honest. We see numerous amounts of men getting cut to ribbons by machine gun fire in seconds. Men getting blown to smithereens left, right and centre, bodies everywhere, its hell on Earth. Yet despite all that, skinny Doss sprints across the barren wasteland, ducking and diving, dodging danger like a ferret and never getting hit. He finds one man after another, treats them, carries them back to safety, hell he even gets forced down into the Jap underground tunnels and treats a soldier down there! All without being discovered, getting injured or even seen! This is why at times I felt like I was watching a superhero origins flick.\n\nWhilst the film is amazingly accurate and harrowing at the same time there were still things that nagged me. Some of these were really quite blatantly obvious too such as the knife that one soldier gets stuck in his foot right at the start of training...yet this doesn't go anywhere. The dude has a big hunting type knife stuck in his foot. Drill Sergeant Vince Vaughn sees it, pulls it out and the man goes off into training? No treatment for that then?? Whilst Doss is up on the ridge pulling injured men to safety and lowering them down the cliff, even though other soldiers have noticed this, no one feels the need to climb up and help him? Then there was the fact that these soldiers at the bottom of the cliff, apparently, didn't report any of this till much later. Which we find out later in the film when it eventually does get reported that someone is lowering bodies down the cliff. Lastly, I don't know how accurate everything is in this film but the ending did seem very Hollywood-esque to me. Expected I guess but I would of preferred a more down to earth approach which it may or may not have been admittedly.\n\nThis is a Mel Gibson movie and by now I've come to expect greatness from old Mel. Was this great? well yes and no to be fair. I did enjoy the movie, it did engage me and it was at times emotional, but its not the greatest war film I've come across even though its very good. Its obvious the religious aspect is probably what attracted Gibson to the story in the first place, and he certainly makes the most of it (Doss getting lowered down the cliff face at the end being the clear symbolic religious highlight for sure). But that aspect doesn't cloud the movie if you're worried about that. The film is ferociously violent once the fighting kicks in no doubt about that, is it the most violent war film I've seen? Hmmm...maybe, not too sure. Kudos to Garfield for his portrayal of Desmond Doss, he clearly went all out and lost weight to fit the bill, not only that he does look like the man too. Admittedly I wanted to slap the guy across his cheeks half the time but I guess that's a performance well done. I should also give kudos to Hugo Weaving as Desmond's father with a truly gritty, bruising performance showcasing the man's many demons.\n\nAt the very end we get some real archive footage of the real Desmond Doss being awarded the Medal of Honour by President Harry S. Truman. Desmond himself, Desmond's younger brother Hal and one of Desmond's commanding officers Jack Glover.",

In it's defense, what war movie is actually original nowadays? It seems just about every angle has been covered. Still, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the better ones, as we watch the main character Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) stick to his guns (pun intended) about not carrying a rifle and refusing to carry out any acts of violence whatsoever. He does this through the grueling basic training and even as he performs some of the most heroic, and yes, miraculous acts of bravery during WW2. The film manages to give his character some nuance (this is based on a true story, after all), digging a bit into his childhood and early life with a troubled, alcoholic veteran father who doesn't want to see his son meet the same tragic fate of his deceased war buddies. Garfield is joined by a cast of solid actors, though most of them aren't given much to work with beyond what the script calls for. The film has some genuinely moving scenes that will no doubt reduce some to tears, mixed in with some painfully clich\u00e9 developments and characterizations. The violence is also as gruesome as you've heard, so if that type of things turns you off, stay away, as the entire second half of the movie is dedicated to the battle for Hacksaw Ridge. Overall, a solid war movie that is aiming more to be a crowd-pleaser than anything profound on the level of the aforementioned movies it borrows from, with plenty of tropes audiences will identify with. Not a masterpiece or even a genuinely great film, but it's still highly effective.",

The second half turns to the battlefields of the Pacific and once the fighting starts, it hits you like a damn brick because the jaw-droppjng action is captured with sheer ferocity and insanely dynamic choregraphy! Despite some flashy stylistic choices in the way Gibson displays the carnage and parts of the film being a tad cliched/Hollywoodized, the potrayal of Doss' steadfast grip on his convictions and saving his fellow man without a gun, in the face of insurmountable odds, is downright inspiring & poignant; topped off with an excellent array of performances led marvelously by Andrew Garfield!",

One scene in particular was a shot near the end of the film,  of Andrew Garfield's character where it was shot to look like he was floating to the Heavens.  But, speaking of Garfield, he was the standout here.  His performance carries the film and kept me invested in what is ultimately an interesting story.  The action scenes are well shot, yet extremely violent.  I can see people often disagreeing on this film as it contains many polarizing elements from Gibson directing, to the extreme violence, to the faith element.

He's always been best at portraying stark contrasts in good vs evil, but he's a bit heavy-handed here. \n\nDesmond Doss would probably be the first to say that he is no Christ figure. But Gibson needs a Christ figure for his movies, and forcing that role in Doss is clumsy. He is epically heroic, no question, and this may be the first Gibson-directed protagonist without a double-digit body count, which is different. But ultimately, Gibson is shown to be a director with just one tool in his box: a hammer. A hammer isn't the right tool to tell Doss's amazing story. \n\nBut the real story is so good, it makes the movie worth seeing.

Let's talk about the man, the myth, the \"Jew Hater\", Mel Gibson. Everyone is giving him a hard time for something he said. Yeah, that was not cool at all but that doesn't change the fact that he is a really good director. In fact, Hacksaw Ridge is one of my favorite movies of the year. The visuals, they were amazing. It's like Saving Private Ryan.  However, the editing is really, really, very not good. Like, at all. It's not up there with Moonlight, which should've won best editing, but it's not down there with Suicide Squad, either. But it is really bad. There are also several shots that bother me. For example, someone throws a grenade into a cave or trench. So it's a wide shot of the Americans and the Japanese and the grenade in the middle. But when they want to focus on the grenade, it's the exact same shot but zoomed up. And you don't see it zoom up, the shot just closes in. And then, the camera follows the grenade and it just looks terrible. Apart from that, Hacksaw Ridge was a very well done film and it gets an 8/10.",

Do the math , 2017 minus 2003. That's a fudging long time to make a movie and it worked out. The feel / effect , the war environment is just spectacular, it really is, and you feel for Desmond and him saving all those men. And that quote, when Andrew Garfield says it , it's awesome and then when the real Desmond says it, just wow. Their are not a lot of war movies anymore because of fudging Hollywood cranking them out like hot cakes, but this is actually good. Going into this movie I thought it would be passion for the Christ all over again but it's not, it's something special and will boost Andrew Garfield a career and Vince Vaughn because they've had some bad movies lately and this has put them back as good actors again.",

            "content": "After being kicked out of Hollywood and losing his dignity, I gotta give Mel Gibson credit for coming back with an \"IN YOUR FACE\" movie to the Academy, in order to get nominated. \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is the story about a skinny white boy named Desmond Doss who wants to fight in World War II. Desmond wants to be a medic in order to serve his country, and his excuse is \"I can't stay home while they all go out and fight for me,\" which I guess gets him to the point he wants to save everyone. After receiving permission to be a medic, he saves about 5-10 people in the first battle, 10-15 in the second and after that there aren't any more battles. The reason why I give this movie a low score is because it has about an hour and 10 minutes of talking, which is really boring if you saw the trailer. When the battle starts, it is a COMPLETE slaughterhouse. The blood and gore is totally unnecessary and the fighting is no where near realistic. After watching \"Saving Private Ryan,\" this movie is almost laughable. You can say that the second half is entertaining, but with all that slo-mo, freeze frames, loud sounds, blood and guts flying out it just turns into too much! Some war movies can be fantasies, but Hacksaw Ridge was a true story! The battle sequences and the violences are just ridiculously cheesy and make no sense. The performance from Andrew Garfield is alright, but everyone else is just alright. I don't see much character change between any of them, and by the end I was really waiting for a good fight scene. \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a very stupid war movie, and did not deserve any Oscar nominations, even if the technical stuff was pretty good.

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge is a good film, but too uneven to be a great film. There is noticeable talent at work both in front of and behind the camera. It has received a total of 6 Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director (Mel Gibson), Actor (Andrew Garfield), Editing, Sound Mixing, and Sound Editing. Noticeably, and rightfully, not among those nominations is the screenplay by Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, which is by far the clunkiest element in an otherwise well-made, well-acted war film. \n\nIt seems like a paradox that a movie about a pacifist should be so bloody and gory, but the incredible true story of Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to win the Congressional Medal of Honor, is exactly that. Doss saved the lives of 75 fellow soldiers at the gruesome Battle of Okinawa in 1945 without even carrying a gun. Andrew Garfield plays Doss, a Seventh Day Adventist who enlisted as a combat medic during World War II, despite his vow to never touch a gun or take a life. His beliefs and refusal to use a weapon-not even for target practice-does not win any favor with his army superiors or fellow soldiers. \n\nThere are two distinct halves to Hacksaw Ridge: Doss's life and experiences stateside at home in Virginia and at basic training, and the Battle of Okinawa. It isn't just Doss's religious beliefs that compel him to never use firearms. We see him as a child nearly kill his brother with a brick during a fight. There is also his troubled, abusive, alcoholic father, Tom, an emotionally and psychologically scarred veteran of WWI, played with a superb performance by Hugo Weaving. A brighter side of his life in Virginia is his sweet romance with a nurse named Dorothy, played by Teresa Palmer. They marry and he enlists in the army. If there were so many people taking life in the war, Doss thought, then he would be one person saving life. The movie stops just shy of making Doss into a saint thanks to Garfield's performance. He makes Doss a believable person of strong conviction and goodwill.\n\nWhen Doss arrives at basic training we meet characters with names like: Vito, Tex, Hollywood, Smitty, and Grease. You might think that Hacksaw Ridge accidentally used the screenplay of a war movie from the 1940's or 50's that would've been clich\u00e9d then. There is scene after scene of ham-fisted dialogue of people underestimating Doss, then realizing that they had him all wrong. It's a bit much, but just as soon as you're ready to write off Hacksaw Ridge, it wins you back, usually thanks to one of the great performances. It's at basic training that we meet Vince Vaughn (the lone American in a cast of Brits and Australians) as Doss's tough and serious but somehow hilarious sergeant. It's a role that is perfect for Vaughn. He's great at delivering amusing insults to the new recruits but his stern face and formidable stature, especially when confronting the slender Andrew Garfield-Vaughn is 6'5\" after all-make him quite intimidating. Like Doss, he's a character you believe because of the talent of the performer. \n\nHacksaw Ridge really shines in its second half at the Battle of Okinawa and the skillful direction of Mel Gibson takes the film to another level. Frantic, hellish, and horrific violence and battle sequences are what he excels at, but he never loses the underlying humanity that the first half of the film builds. The scenes set in Virginia are also well done, but only Gibson could craft the second half of this movie. Doss spends three days on the battlefield, day and night, finding wounded and dying soldiers and taking each one to safety by lowering them down a steep cliff one by one. Each time, Doss asks God to help him get one more. This film revels in blood and guts but it does not glorify or make war seem adventurous. It makes war look dirty and gross and frightening and bloody and scary and awful. \n\nI'm perplexed that the movie telling the true story of Desmond Doss is steeped in war movie clich\u00e9s. It's almost frustrating. These clich\u00e9d scenes with stiff, uncreative dialogue occur throughout the movie. It is the excellently shot battle scenes and great performances from Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, and Hugo Weaving that make the film substantial. Despite its flaws, Hacksaw Ridge has enough quality moments and performances to make it well worth watching.",

There's the story of Private Desmond Doss, played by Andrew Garfield, enlisting in the army as a combat medic and contentious objector, fighting for his right to serve without having to touch a weapon. That part of the story works. Garfield is effective in the role and builds sympathy for this character who only wants to serve his country and God at the same time. \n\nHowever, the second half of the film is a different thing entirely as the violence of war takes center stage. For me it was too much, and it didn't work. Saving Private Ryan is a World War 2 movie with terrific violence, but Steven Spielberg  knows just how long to push it before giving the audience a breath. Hacksaw Ridge, directed by Mel Gibson - a man who loves his violent imagery in film, doesn't know when to let up. \n\nThe first half of the film is good enough to make this film worth a watch, but be warned the second half is not for the faint of heart.",

This really is his movie, every other character serves to prop up his own.

The first half feels rather unnecessary as it tells the bland love story that's not fleshed out at all, and shows how and why he decided not to kill and not to hold a gun, and it shows how the people around him did not respect his beliefs and how he had to defend them. The second half is the better part, showing the true horrors of war, however most of the people he saves is shown in a montage. If the whole movie was mostly about him saving those 75 men with no weapon under fire, then the movie would have been much better. This movie also suffers from being cheesy sometimes, sometimes showing slow motion of him running away from getting shot while holding someone on his back, the scene sounds good until they added the cheesy slow motion and the cheesy music, this scene shouldn't have cheesy slow motion and music, it should be terrifying and full of tension.",

That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\n\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\n\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\n\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\n\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\n\n7.5/10",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer and Hugo Weaving and tells the true story of Desmond Doss a man who would not go into a battle with a weapon and managed to save 75 man in Okinawa.\nI really like Mel Gibson as a filmmaker, I think he is a very talented director as well as a very talented actor and really good at doing both jobs as proven in the Brave Heart which is still to this day an amazing movie. So hearting that Mel Gibson was going to be making a war film as you can imagine got me hyped and boy was it worth the hype. Hacksaw Ridge might just be his best movie, yes even slightly better than Brave Heart, which believe me is really saying something.\nThe Performances from pretty much everyone in this movie were fantastic. Andrew Garfield was phenomenal as Desmond Doss. His accent in this movie actually made me forget that this guy is actually from LA. Watching what Desmond had to deal with during his training in the army was just haunting, you really feel for him whenever he is criticised and bullied by his fellow soldiers about his decision to go into battle without a weapon to defend himself and sticking to what he believes.\nTeresa Palmer was also fantastic in this movie, she isn't in the movie all too much but what we got from her was amazing. The romance between her and Desmond was so well developed and very charming to watch on screen.\nLuke Bracey was awesome in this movie, he was really entertaining whenever he was on screen and thought his interactions between him and Desmond was some pretty powerful stuff. I enjoyed seeing the relationship between these 2 dudes develop as the film progressed and he was actually one of the most compelling characters in this movie.\nVince Vaughn was incredible he just disappeared inside this man. He had some really funny scenes in the first hour of this movie and he was just so enjoyable to watch on screen, there is an action sequence with Vaughn and Garfield that was so thrilling and suspenseful that I swear my heart literally skipped a beat, more on the action later.\nHugo Weaving was fantastic. I will admit I haven't seen this actor in many movies outside of the Matrix, Captain America, V for Vendetta, Transformers 3 and the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies. But this in my opinion is the best performance this actor has ever delivered when I compare it to everything else I've seen him in. His character arc was very interesting and made for some really good drama.\nSam Worthington was great in this movie. I personally think that Sam Worthington is a much underrated actor, so it's actually really refreshing to see him in a role that he is actually being praised for and he really deserves it. He was amazing in this film. \nThis movie is superbly directed. The way Mel Gibson moves the camera alone pretty much shows how hard he tried with this movie, this movie has some pretty breath taking shots that like quite a few films recently made me think \"how the Spagbowl did they shoot that?\" \n\nDuring the war scenes I wasn't thinking \"oh my god that was amazing, oh yes, yes, yes whooooooaaaaa!!!!!!!\" I was actually shocked and horrified; my heart was beating really, really fast, was genuinely terrified when someone was shot or blown to bits. It was almost like watching a horror film. They were so violent, so gory and unbelievably suspenseful it was just unbelievable. \nI've never actually sat through a film with action sequences that have really made me feel that way which I'll be honest pretty much in affect makes this the most realistic war film I've ever seen. Too many films of the same genre sometimes make the mistake of having huge action sequences just to please action movie fans and I would say that the film Fury is good example of a film making that mistake as much as I live that film. Hacksaw doesn't make that mistake not even once. This film really does show you the full extent of the horrors of war and never once held back. There are always these long extensive shots where can see everything that's going on in that sequence with zero shaky cam and that was just really refreshing to see.\nDid I have problems with this movie, I will admit I did have a couple. For starters while it wasn't that noticeable, I did kinda notice that the films structure in the 20 minutes of the film felt very similar to Brave Heart, but considering this film is 2 hours and 19 minutes long that's a very small handful. I'm not goanna lie the music also got a little too over the top at one point for my taste and I did end up thinking at that point ok this is getting a little too melodramatic, but considering that was like minutes away from the ending of the film I can look passed that very easily.\nOverall Hacksaw Ridge is an incredible movie and by far the best war film I've ever seen. I seriously recommend you check this movie out because it is one heck of a thrill ride.",

Real slow in the beginning....well the middle too...and now that I mention it at the end. I was able to go to the bathroom during the third act and not miss anything. This right after my brother went to the bathroom and he didn't miss anything either.  Would I recommend this movie? Yes. Do I think it should be in the list of best pictures? Sure why not?

            "content": "No endeavor pursued by our species is more destructive yet so frequently engaged than war. It blatantly destroys every aspect of the fabric of society from the pervasive institutions of governments and armed services to the imamate associations that are the core of humanity, the family. Arguably, I am possible to make a case for war's ability to bring to light some of the noblest qualities human beings are capable of demonstrating. Considered paramount among these actions are \"personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty.\" Soldiers exhibiting such acts of extreme bravery eschewing any concern for self-preservation, giving their all to the greater good and welfare of others are eligible for the United States of America's highest military honor, Medal of Honor. Since the Civil War 3,496 soldiers have had this honor bestowed on them but only one demonstrated such extraordinary gallantry without carrying a weapon of any sort on to the field of battle, PFC Desmond Doss, incredibly portrayed in this biographical film by Andrew Garfield. He was previously best known for the titular role the mediocre reboot of 'The Amazing Spider-Man,' that part has been left in the dust by his performance in the film considered here, 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Is craftsmanship has Private Doss has earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role? Mr. Garfield was not the only representation this film had at the annual Nominees Luncheon, producers Bill Mechanic and David Permut earned their place at the table for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and Mel Gibson once again attended this elite gathering with his nomination for Best Achievement in Directing. In a couple of months, the envelopes will be open, and the world will learn if any of this nomination yielded the coveted gold statues. Regardless of the results, this film possesses the sheer impressive qualities that even if you are not particularly a fan of war movies, this film will captivate your attention and instill an unforgettable emotional response.\n\nDesmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) grew up near Lynchburg, Virginia in a family of the valve beliefs in their religion, Seventh-day Adventist. As a child, he was involved in an accident that almost took his brother's life which made his consideration of the commandment \"you will not kill,\" something intensely personal to him. His first experience with helping the injured occurred when Desmond happened upon a severely injured man who was in a car accident. He brought the man to the hospital where he experienced the second pivotal moment of the day, reading one of the nurses, Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer). Soon, the relationship between the two developed she was the first one he expressed his desire for life's vocation, to receive medical training and help people. As the United States was drawn into World War II Desmond felt obliged to enlist in the Army. His father, a World War I veteran, adamantly objected to this decision because he was a conscientious objector. Desmond enlists as a combat medic, but before leaving for basic training, he proposes to Dorothy who happily accepts. As a symbol of their engagement and recognition of his deep-seated faith, Dorothy gives him a Bible to carry with them during his tour of duty. Overseeing their basic training was Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn), who took a liking to the young man because of his polite demeanor and dedication. Unfortunately, the rest of the men in his unit did not share the sentiments. Desmond was considered an outcast because he would not carry a weapon during training and he would refuse to train on Saturday because of his religious objections. A concerted effort was made to have Doss resigned from the service. The commanding officer, Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) attempted to have him discharged on psychiatric grounds and Sgt. Howell attempted to force the resignation by inflicting strenuous physical activity upon the faith driven young man. The men in his unit were so against his presence there that they severely beat him, yet still, he was steadfast in his decision to remain.\n\nDesmond and hope that after his training he would receive leave so he could return home and married Dorothy. Instead, he was arrested for insubordination resulting from his refusal to carry a weapon. When Dorothy visits him during his incarceration, she urges him just to plead guilty, but Desmond refuses to compromise his beliefs. His father intervened by bringing a letter from his commanding officer stating that an Act of Congress protects his pacifism. Charges were dropped in Desmond and Dorothy was married. Doss was sent to the Pacific theater as part of the 77th Infantry Division in the position of a combat medic. Despite the fact that he was in an active war zone Doss continued his refusal to carry a weapon. The action that would lead to his commendation occurred at the infamous Battle of Okinawa the vision was to relieve the 96th Infantry Division who charged with securing a section of terrain known as Hacksaw Ridge. The combat was fierce with heavy casualties on both sides. It was during this engagement that Desmond Doss demonstrates to the men who ridiculed him the true nature of conviction and bravery. Upon hearing the cries of the wounded and dying Doss runs back towards the action hoping some 75 men down the escarpment safety. He also treated several dozen others mending their wounds as best he could do that they could find their greater safety. Utilizing a requisite plot point that although based in truth is undoubtedly necessary for dramatic effect, Doss saves the life of a soldier that had once called him a coward. He also manages to rescue the Sergeant who drove home unforgiving the hard and attempt to break your spirit.\n\nThis is the first feature film Mel Gibson since 'Apocalypto' in the first film in a dozen years that did not utilize a 'dead' language. Mr. Gibson may be a very controversial figure many unusual situations documented in the tabloid news. Despite this, no one can deny that he is one of the most talented directors currently working in Hollywood. He manages to elicit performances from his actors that showcase the full versatility and intensity of their talents. An example would have to include Mr. Garfield's credibility with any members of the audience took a hit because of a pair of movies that he was costumed in red and black spandex swinging from a harness in front of a green screen. After his performance in this movie is a foray into comic book films can be relegated to a footnote and what is certain to be an illustrious career ahead of him Reports that members of the Doss family were moved to tears by the authenticity of Mr. Garfield's performance. The most crucial thing for an actor appearing in a biography is to avoid the tendency to do an imitation based on whatever historical material may be available. What Mr. Garfield achieves here was to capture the essence of a truly unique individual. Most people before going into combat would be terrifying even if were armed and trained to defend yourself. The very thought of placing yourself in such active danger carrying only a medic kit is unimaginable even for most of the bravest soldiers with the fought. Desmond Doss is credited with bringing 75 men down a 400-foot escarpment, traveling 200 yards into the combat zone to rescue a man, gave medical treatment to for men with 8 yards of a heavily defended enemy stronghold and within some 25 feet of active enemy fire treated over 100 men helping them to safety. Even after being injured by a grenade he demanded that the evacuation team remover more seriously injured man before removing him from the battlefield. This incredible life is innately difficult for any actor to attempt to portray, but Andrew Garfield did so deport himself with talent and respect while instilling the role the nuances that help make his character brutally identifiable though sitting in the audience.\n\nAt times it may seem that Mr. Gibson went overboard with his use of violence. It is unthinkable that any new go into watching the storm with any other expectations specifically after his 'Passion of the Christ 'and is a disturbingly realistic portrayal of brutal torture and execution. Unlike the so-called torture porn flicks that inundated the horror genre, the violence utilized here can be explicit but in no way gratuitous. There is no realistic way to all of the memory of this man and honestly, depict the magnitude of his actions without exposing the audience to the whole level of viciousness that occurs in war. It may be considered one of the most violent movies in recent history, exclusive of those that were created for exploitative purposes, the revolting nature of the savagery can only provide a shadow of what private Doss endured.",

Most would not be bothered by this, I admit that, but I spend the better part of the movie laughing and face palming due to the actors behaving so predictably \"heroic\" yet stupid. The sound editing during a battle was messed up as all hell. I guess it was supposed to come out artsy, but it's just bothersome and emersion breaking. \nThe movie is a bland and corny war melodrama made to twist the heart strings in a most blatant and unoriginal way. And as a whole I found it to be a waste of a solid premise in other to pander to people who seek cheap tragedy. And I am sorry this is not a Spanish soap opera - war shouldn't have anything to do with tawdry melodrama. And since when is tacky american ego stroking worth an Oscar. Oh right, it always was.",

            "content": "Critics claims that Hacksaw Ridge is the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan. I will not disagree. Based on unforgettable true story of bravery and belief of a hero soldier during the brutal Battle at Okinawa, directed by Oscar winner Mel Gibson who gives his most unflinching work since Apocalypto (2006).\n\nHacksaw Ridge is probably one of the most violent war films you'll ever see and being compared to Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998), but Gibson made sure that we'd see his daring style filmmaking we've seen in his previous films. He's made a brilliant decision to go to old fashion-filmmaking and sustain his style as a visionary filmmaker. One of the things that stood out to me is Simon Duggan's cinematography. If you didn't know anything behind this film, you might think that it was filmed in 80's or 90's.\n\nOne of the things I like about Hacksaw Ridge is its faith to the story of Desmond Doss. The story primarily focuses on Desmond Doss journey, the struggles we went through joining the army while standing in his belief. Despite of its extreme violence and realistic battle scenes, the film is able to sustain its inspiring and moving story about Doss' heroism who rescued over 75 wounded soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge. Desmond Doss is (Conscientious Objector), a seventh-day adventist of Protestant sect of Christianity, who refuses to carry a weapon because of his personal beliefs and violence happened in his childhood that shaped his attitude and makes him refuse to touch a gun. But then got accepted and joined the army under Sergeant Howell's command as a medic. Doss never fired a bullet, its even said in the trailer.\n\nLet's talk about the war scenes. The battle scenes in this film aren't fake, when they hit, they hit. Gibson's depiction of war scenes are the most terrifying and disturbing moments I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. Andrew Garfield is one of the most talented actors working today who gives an outstanding performance, the best performance of his career. I love when I cry at the movies, and his performance was truly heartbreaking, that's how good he is.\n\nThe supporting cast gives nomination-worthy performances, too. Teresa Palmer who gives a touching performance, also the best performance of her career. Vince Vaughn (Sergeant Howell) and Sam Worthington (Captain Jack Glover) gives impressive performances. This film has also a supporting performance from Luke Bracey who gives an effect performance as Smitty Ryke. But Hugo Weaving (Tom Doss) who plays Desmond's drunk father who gives an Oscar caliber performance I can't stop thinking about. His performance in this film was so unexpected. I was blown away by his performance.\n\nHacksaw Ridge is harrowing, soulful and violent depiction of war, filled with great performances. One of the most successful war films ever made.\n\nI just saw it yesterday and I couldn't stop thinking about this film. When I left the theater I was just speechless and teary that's how great this film is.\n\nI totally recommend this film. Please DO NOT wait to see it on a device on you can hold in your hand. See this film.",

It has 3 main acts. \n\nThe 1st act establishes who the protagonist is. Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss, WWII American Army Medic who refused to carry a weapon or kill people due to his religious beliefs, but wanted to enlist as a medic so that he can do his part for the country. Now obviously there was politics as to how can someone go to war but not carry a weapon, and despite how interesting that politics was, I felt that Director Mel Gibson took a bit too long to establish it all and hence overindulged a little to much.\n\nBut as soon as I started to loose interest, the 2nd act began, and boy was it a complete transformation. The 2nd act takes place at Hacksaw Ridge were the American Army is trying to capture it back from the Japanese but are failing miserably. And those scene are one of the best war scenes I have ever seen on screen. If you have seen Gibson's previous movies you know that his movies are inherently violent. So there are no hold backs here. The war scenes are both violent and graphic, and that makes it feel very real and not just some drama we are watching in the cinemas. So when Doss is rescuing injured solders, the stakes feel real and not staged drama. You feel that you have been teleported to the battle and are there with the soldiers. \n\nBut then the 3rd act appears and suddenly this real and grounded war movie turns into a cheesy movie where things are unnecessarily overdramatized. And it is made into an over the top religious drama for no good reason. And that takes so much away from this movie.\n\nBut because it is a true story, so when you hear about it, despite your own religious beliefs, you feel for Doss and his courage. And when you are watching the movie you cheer and root for him. But how I wish that Gibson had stuck to the treatment he chose for the 2nd act, all the way till the end. It would have made it into a masterpiece. Having said that, it is still a great movie that should be experienced for both the 2nd act and Andrew Garfield's honest performance.",

Hacksaw Ridge is such a film, but is unique in its choice of subject, that of a conscientious objector who nevertheless proves that heroism and courage comes in many forms.\n\nAndrew Garfield delivers probably the most challenging performance of his young career, and succeeds at capturing the empathy of the viewer and channeling Desmond's conviction. Meanwhile, all around him the explosions and artillery fire reach almost Michael Bay proportions. It's all to place Desmond in a setting of hellfire as he saves man after man, but the scale gets a little ridiculous. Still, the true story nature of the film is gripping, and audience's become familiar with yet another American hero.",

Followed by his initial boot camp training with a urprisingly brilliant turn by Vince Vaughn as his piss taking drill sergeant. \n\nIt's when the action moves inevitably to the ridge you see the real meat of the film. Violent, utterly disorientating and almost matching the heights of Saving Private Ryan's beach landing scene for raw brutality and showing the waste of human life. It's there that Desmond showed the real heroics that got him the medal of honor after the war. Saving 75 soldiers plus himself. \n\nHacksaw Ridge isn't perfect though, it does unintentionally come across as far fetched and a bit silly in places, but really hits you where it matters most.",

That is, until Garfield starts slapping and kicking the odd grenade for good measure.\nThe screenplay certainly has its holes and all subtly is thrown to the wind, as is to be expected of Mr Gibson.

The true tale of Desmond Doss (though slightly tweaked to make for a better dramatic narrative) provides a new and fresh angle for yet another World War II movie. The character of Doss and particularly his the relationship with the Doss patriarch are brought to life vividly by some fantastic acting from Andrew Garfield and Hugo Weaving. And a warm, light-handed comedic spice is surprisingly delivered by Vince Vaughn as the tough love drill sergeant.  The production design is great and although the VFX aren't great, they are used properly and sparingly to keep an organic and gritty tone without too many jump-cut style combat shots. \n\nAll in all it's good, but not great. A unmemorable score carries the film but never leaves an emotional impression the way the performances from the cast do. And while being a fun 2 hours and a heavy story to take in and enjoy, it just doesn't fall into that batch of war films you feel like you need to own on the shelf and watch again someday.",

Inspiring story, frightening awesome war scenes, beautifully shot (excellent use of the camera) and a great supporting cast as well.

The first half tries too hard to set the character in context, but all of the other characters are so one dimensional that it's a waste of effort and adds little to the narrative. We care about him, but little about anyone else.\n\nThen there's the fakey, flash bang splatter of the Okinawa staging, with whole fields full of guts and severed limbs, that just makes it seem like '300' in khaki and boots. \n\nIn the end the film doesn't really do the hero justice. And to an English ear, seeing him at age 85 and unintelligible does him a disservice too.\n\nWeird, weird, weird. I don't know that Mel Gibson was trying to do, but spending $150m to undersell a truly great act of principle and heroism was probably not it.",

Directed by Mel Gibson, whose directorial style is very well suited to these enormous epic type films, it is the human element that is almost as appealing as the grand scale at which Gibson directs, as strong performances from a stellar cast including Teresa Palmer, Vince Vaughan and an extrordinary turn from Hugo Weaving as Doss's father elevate this movie above a simple war film. It is however the performance of Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss which has the award nominations coming in and rightly so. He plays the lead character with all the compassion, stubborness and honour that Doss deserved and has been rightly Oscar nominated for his part.\nA word of mention does have to go to the battle scenes also however, and suffice it to say they are not for the faint hearted, in fact they make the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan seem like something out of Toy Story.\nOverall, although it may not be celebrating around Oscar time, Hacksaw Ridge is a well made tribute to an extrordinary man dealt with amicably in the hands of a very capable director and his talented cast.",

We have here a script that does not work with linearity, we start at the end, we see the beginning, the middle, the beginning and then it's only advancement, but these changes are so subtle that if you're not paying attention, You could develop a few more issues like your brother having gone to war and also your relationship which is very sudden but in the end you understand why you took the course you took and you end up accepting. We have the story of Desmond T. Doss (Abdrew Garfield), a soldier who goes to war two without even carrying a gun, and ends up being the bravest man in his battalion working as a doctor in the trenches and being guided by his faith. The film deals with religion in an excellent way, we are not forced to accept the faith of doss, it does not oblige anyone, and despite all the contrary comments and questioning their faith, it is there, and their courage does not come from holding a Gun, Doss proves that courage is in man's ideal, the horrors of war are also treated, Gibson has no shame in showing torn bodies, viscera and bloodbaths, this is a war, it is for you to be uncomfortable even, it is For you to repudiate it, and the film does not deal with the drama of war only in battle, we see the drama of Tom Doss - Desmond's Desire - who lost friends in the Great War, and now fears losing his children, we have some glimpses about domestic violence , But all with the look of flashbacks and very superficially. The technical highlights do not stand for the picture or soundtrack, although both are good, there is nothing that stands out more than the sound mix of that movie that is spectacular, every shot passing from scratch you feel that passed in you, each loading of Gun, every musket stab, every man that falls to the ground, every blast or shot is extremely alive, you notice everyone, it is not something common like most war movies. Andrew Garfield has a spectacular performance, he is completely perfect, when he cries, you cry, when he laughs, you laugh, when he gets excited, you are already completely thrilled next to him, worth a line too for Hugo Weaving, who I found it spectacular as a supporting actor playing Desmond's father, although he had little screen time. Mel Gibson can not go on for ten years without producing anything, none of his films are a great work of art, but all are great. \"Up to the Last Man\" is not perfect, has a lot of idea repetition, and some technical features that do not touch the viewer as it should. -Dr. Andrew's performance buries these problems-, some script points not developed as I explained earlier, but We are treated to great battle scenes, good performances, and a story that touched even the most carambudo viewer, and it was Gibson's great sensitivity to finish the movie the way it ended.",

Gibson stages these difficult scenes effortlessly, but to what end? Who is the audience for young men being blown apart for 90 minutes and what elevates that to high art? This is a cynical, shallow film dressed up in award-season trappings. That it is considered among the best films made this year is evidence that the film industry misses its medium's purpose and power. In seemingly trying to make a film about the merits of active pacifism (as opposed to active antagonism), Gibson hasn't so much made an anti-war film about faith or sticking to one's (lack of) guns as much as he's made one showcasing why generations of men (including himself) are so fucked up.",

They did a marvelous job of setting up Andrew Garfield's character, and his backstory (which continues to expand throughout the film.) There was a slow build to the story (particularly because we know where he'll end up) but it all felt necessary to help us connect with the hero of the story. I also enjoyed how the romantic relationship added some heart to the story.\n\nWhile I'm sure many facts were tweaked or embellished for the sake of making a good movie, it felt so authentic. The boot camp sequences where his pacifism is treated so harshly is exactly what you'd expect, and helps to make the nobility of his actions more powerful. The biggest struggle I had with the film was the casting of Vince Vaughn. I cannot take that guy seriously, and he takes me out of the movie every time I see his face or hear him talk. \n\nGarfield was great, and when the movie finally gets to the climax I was absolutely enthralled. It's one of those heartwarming tales that seems too good to be true. It seems a bit odd that a movie focused on a conscientious objector would embrace violence so heartily. Most of the way through it feels like the brutal violence is just an attempt to create an authentic war movie. However there are a few sequences that don't add to the story and just come across as needless excess.\n\nAside from my minor complaints, I thought Hacksaw Ridge was a strong film and one I'll probably watch again. It's made even more powerful because it is rooted in an amazing true story. I could see the violence turning away some audiences who might enjoy it otherwise, but if you are OK with that kind of graphic gore, then I think it's one worth watching.",

Maybe due to too much shaky cam? No! Sorry. That was a cheap shot and I'm actually a massive fan of Gibson, he's still very much one of my favourites and I know he can take a joke. \n\nGibson is one of the few directors who can boast a long runtime and it not be a warning off-putter, though not as long as Braveheart, it's up there with this longest films with a runtime of 139mins, but you certainly don't notice it. \n\nThe film is based on the legendary WWII army medic, Pfc. Desmond Doss who enlisted but with an absolutely objection to firing a single bullet, not just during the war zone but during training also, who went on to serve regardless and saved of life's of approximately 75 soldiers under fire.\n\nThe film is in two parts. Firstly the background on Doss, his family, his love and the eventual training where he becomes branded a conscientious objector, bringing him a world of hurt and abuse from his fellow regiment and the military powers. It has to be mentioned, during this part Hugo Weaving gives an incredible performance as his drunken father clearly combating PTSD. \n\nThe second part of the film is the obvious, bloody assault on Hacksaw Ridge. The carnage of unforgiving violence that's gruesome yet captivating to watch. The brutal war scenes are loaded with exaggerated action for cinematographic purposes but is superbly executed with building tension and often gory outcomes. \n\nAndrew Garfield takes the lead role of Pfc. Doss and does an amazing job. I can only believe he done the hero justice because the son was brought to tears during a screening. The supporting cast, including names Sam Worthington, Teresa Palmer and Luke Bracey all give good strong performances. And apologies to Vince Vaughn because he's an actor I find difficult to take seriously. But he fills the Sargent's boots quite well, nearly bursting a blood vessel bellowing humorous insults at his subordinates. Unfortunately, scenes like that will always be compared to R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, but Vaughn does an amazing job. \n\nGibson' direction, like most of his films, is quite symbolic with some stunning visual imagery. He doesn't shy away from the opposing side either. The war sequences are some of the best captured, striking a realism that Saving Private Ryan got respected for. \n\nRupert Gregson-Williams score replaces John Debney's rejected score, after he replaced the late James Horner. Gregson-Williams actually does a good score in honour of Horner, mimicking his style to a degree, just listening to \"Okinawa Battlefield\" has echoes of Horner. \n\nThough the number of people saved are not wholly accurate, to say 75 people is actually an understatement, himself saying 50 on that particular bloody night, witnesses claim it to be 100, which could be a result of him treating 50 men up on the escarpment who made their own way back to camp. It's said that during his three week tour he rescued a number close to 300 souls. \n\nCertainly succeeds in placing Desmond Doss in eternity, being an incredible, moving tribute to the hero about courage and belief to stand alone not just against adversity but against the common command of war. A remarkable story about an even more remarkable man. \n\nRunning Time: 9\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 10\nDirection: 10\nStory: 9\nScript: 10\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 8\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being an amazing tribute not just to Desmond Doss, but to all conscientious collaborators. \n\n95% 10/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

            "content": "For many years, Mel Gibson has been at the center of controversies and other unwelcome attention-grabbing incidents. While this normally kills any actor's chances of reviving their careers, Gibson has instead managed to remain somewhat unscathed by retreating into his other skill: directing. As we've seen from some of his other directorial efforts, he is skilled behind the lens, even if many themes remain the same. From Braveheart (1995) to The Passion of the Christ (2004), Gibson has a tendency to be pretty brutal in the imagery he brings to the screen. Granted, this is partly due to the semi-factual source material.\n\nIn his latest work after a long hiatus, Gibson brings us the brutality that is World War II. Hacksaw Ridge takes some time to get to its emotional center, but the unfortunate side effect of this is a series of characters that feel almost comical in their exaggerations. From Andrew Garfield's goofily grinning Desmond T. Doss to Hugo Weaving's alcoholic Tom Doss, the reality of war easily sets in once Desmond is allowed to deploy to the Pacific theatre and \"fight\" with his fellow man, attempting to do what no one else is willing to: save more lives than he ends.\n\nThe brutality of Hacksaw Ridge is clearly portrayed by Gibson's directing, most of the time being a bit over the top. Partly because everything in this film seemed overly exaggerated, it's almost hard to take it very seriously. Sure, the religious themes intertwined with the duty of going to war were an interesting combination and the real-life story of this human savior was inspiring; but at the end of the day, the other aspects of the film seemed to lessen these impacts.\n\nA brutal look at the true cost of being a conscientious objector during war, I give Hacksaw Ridge 3.5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Ten years after the release of the critically acclaimed Apocalypto, Mel Gibson reaffirms his position as a top director in explosive fashion with his latest picture, Hacksaw Ridge. Exploring the incredible true story of Desmond Doss, a self proclaimed 'conscientious collaborator', as he wrestles with both his religious beliefs and his comrades, who view those beliefs as cowardice. \n\nThe title of the feature originates from an important tactical location, nicknamed Hacksaw Ridge during the Battle of Okinawa. This is where the majority of combat scenes take place. Before any action begins, we are informed of multiple failed attempts to take the ridge, each time getting pushed back by the relentless Japanese army. Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) regards Hacksaw as the key to winning the war: 'We take Hacksaw, we get Okinawa. We get Okinawa, we take Japan.' \n\nInterestingly, the tone shifts dramatically and instantaneously when they arrive on Okinawa. There are certain parallels that can be drawn between this and Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. For instance both have two very distinct halves. The first, a pre war training segment where we see the protagonist battle with his will, and the second, with the characters thrown into the heart of battle. Gibson's work however employs a melodramatic style throughout the films opening, presenting life as almost idyllic. An unfaltering love story hindered only by his veteran father, who drowns his sorrow in alcohol to the detriment of his family, played fantastically by Hugo Weaving.\n\nOn the topic of acting, there were a slew of surprisingly convincing performances. Andrew Garfield, in his second and his best religious lead of 2017, seems to have ditched the Spider-Man typecasting with this Oscar nominated display. By far the most unexpected revelation though was Vince Vaughn as the initially hostile but ultimately compassionate Sergeant Howell. Perhaps the most memorable scene involves Vaughn's character assessing the new recruits at the barracks. Using the wit reminiscent of some of his previous comedic roles such as Wedding Crashers and Dodgeball, he attempts to break them down through well aimed character abuse.\n\nSeveral times throughout the film, Gibson, like in his other films, fetishises violence. Being by far the worst offender of his catalogue, once the war begins, the slaughter is never far behind. The camera always lingers just a moment too long on the destruction, sadistically teasing the audience, even the eruption of flames from the flamethrower is alluring. This exaggerated romanticism contradicts the anti-war message the film otherwise overwhelmingly attempts to convey.\n\nHacksaw Ridge adopts traits common to vintage war films juxtaposed with modern special effects for the gory detail. It ends by showing interviews from Doss and those he saved, a poignant reminder that this is a true story, and the atrocities we see on screen affected real people who fought and lost their lives to protect ours.",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge has been touted as a sort of return to the public stage for director Mel Gibson. It is difficult to surmise that this film would not have been up for more than \"best director\" (which in itself comes with a bit of controversy) if not for the reputation of Gibson's recent years of perceived missteps and misfortunes. And yet, as a film, there is no mistaking the rather obvious undertones of a story that juxtaposes some of the most violent war scenes ever filmed with a story about faith, conviction and forgiveness. It feels to be an intensely personal project, and the film certainly gains from its sort of poignant, no-holds barred sort of honesty.\n\nThe film tells the true story of Desmond Doss, a role that carries some very real parallels to Garfields subsequent role in Scorcese's silence. Desmond feels compelled to give his life in service to his country as the world is being pushed to the brink of war, but struggles to reconcile this with his commitment to pacifism and non-violent response. To rectify this tension of conscious and conviction, Desmond chooses to enlist as a medic under the freedom the constitution affords him to refuse to carry arms. \n\nWhat follows is a story that plays on two levels, the first being the story of his past that leads to his conviction to never carry arms, and the second being the story of his harrowing journey of perseverance through ridicule and redemption at Hacksaw Ridge. \n\nGibson tells the story in a wonderfully succinct and simple fashion. In a strange way he creates an oddly affecting family friendly war movie that manages to be entirely cohesive as an end product. He really manages to capture the way in which Desmond's painfully dark past meets with a sort of old-fashioned innocence and sense of optimism, something that Garfield embodies with a  performance that I think could rival his turn in Silence (although he is certainly equally good in that film).\n\nIf you have seen the film, you will know that once you hit the second half the film becomes an absolutely relentless depiction of the devastation of war. For as relentless as it is, Gibson never lets it get away from him. As a viewer, I never felt like he was glorifying in the violence. The film always feels incredibly purposed, and through all of the blood and the fallen bodies, it is Desmond's conviction and perseverance that rings the loudest. It is his ability to forgive what feels unforgivable, and his unshakeable belief in a faith that stands taller than his own ability to make a difference, that remains most compelling, maybe especially in the light of our modern landscape.",

To say the action is brutal and visceral is an understatement. It makes Saving Private Ryan's opening battle scene seem tame. It is a film of two halves though, where the first 60 minutes or so is fairly slow and largely forgettable. However, once the action hits it's a non-stop assault on your senses and will make you feel uneasy at just how chaotic and deadly being in this situation must feel like. The story is based on real life events and real people, which is important to remember as it just seems so unlikely. Definitely worth seeing in a cinema, but if you're overly squeamish it may not be for you. 4.5 stars out of 5",

Andrew Garfield is actually pretty great here and is more than game, Teresa Palmer is given a small role with little to do (But she is still drop-dead gorgeous), Hugo Weaving is fine as Dobb's drunken dad, and there are some great scenes interspersed throughout. The character of Desmond Hobbs is a cool and interesting one, and his story is cool, crazy and interesting. His story deserves a better film than this, and a defter hand than Mel Gibson's.

Like Braveheart and Apocalypto, Hacksaw Ridge is brutal. The war scenes here are nearly on a par with Spielberg masterpiece Saving Private Ryan. As the film begins we see screaming men set a flame, arms and legs severed by artillery, blood and guts sprayed across the screen all in slow motion. Later we see mutilated bodies being eaten by Rats & Maggots and trucks full of bloody bodies. This is not for the squeamish. Even by Gibson's own high standards (The Passion of the Christ I'm talking about you here) this is his must violent and stomach churning film yet.\nAfter the initial shocking opening things slow down as we meet Desmond Doss played by Andrew Garfield. He wants to serve his country but after a couple of violent episodes in his youth has sworn not to take a life or even hold a weapon. When he finally enlists as a Medic his religious beliefs are put to the test as his fellow soldiers believe him to be a coward and try to force him out with beatings and abuse. His superior officers even get in on the act court martialing him for disobeying orders.\nGarfield is brilliant in the role. He carries the film and plays Doss with just the right amount heart and grit. His best actor Oscar nomination is well deserved. Great support too from Vincent Vaughn as his Sgt. He brings much needed humour to the training scenes. Teresa Palmer is also good as Doss' sweetheart Dorothy although some of the romantic scenes are a little on the corny side.\nHacksaw Ridge is an excellent war film and tells an incredible story but it left this reviewer a little cold in terms of emotion. This film could and should have been moving but it just didn't connect enough for me. The films score is one of the issues. I don't recall the films music at all. Unlike Braveheat where the sweeping score added emotion, oh how this film needed the late great James Horner's touch. Also potentially moving scenes seem a little underplayed where they could have soared. Another minor gripe that could bother some (not me) is the film is not subtle in terms of religion. One scene in particular towards the end of the film is bordering on Christ like. Given Gibson's recent escapades it's not very subtle.\nThese nitpicks aside Hacksaw Ridge is a welcome return of a great director and fitting tribute to a very brave man and the very brave men he served along side.",

This film nails the tone these franchises have made effortlessly. With a unique story and situation for the WW2 genre it was a breath of fresh air. \n\nAndrew Garfield pulls off the southern drawl and the core beliefs of his character as if they where secound nature. This role is what I think he will be defined for in years to come. \n\nThe movie was incredible at balancing the right tone between the struggles that Desmond Doss goes through at the beginning in training, right up until the secound half where the movie really starts to shine. The action scenes seemed very real and despite a few moments highlighted the atrocities which was the battle of hacksaw ridge. \n\nAnother nod I would like to mention is Vince Vaughn who nails his portrayal of a gruff no nonsense drill sergeant. A character I have seen in movies countless times and with Vaughns comedic chops really makes his drill sergeant stand out amounts the rest. \n\nMel Gibson, I find myself saying, nails it in the directors chair. Each scene was well established and he did a incredible job directing this film. \n\n\nA few gripes I did have with the film where as follows. Discovering that the film was directed by Mel Gibson. I initially thought it would be a Jesus fest and a massive preach for Christianity. In some parts the film does feel like the whole god thing is being shoved down your throats especially in the beginning. However, it is a key factor in telling private doss's story and overall fits well I tot he movie. Just a few scenes made me think it was a bit preachy. Also some of the battle scenes came across as choreographed and deliberately violent and unrealistic for entertainment needs. Now don't get me wrong as you will know from my assassins creed review I love action scenes and violence in movies. But I feel these scenes detracted from the tone set up in hacksaw ridge and took away some of the weight to the film as a result. \n\nI implore you to go see this film. It's a incredible tale told well and I think it's one of the best films to be released in recent memory. Cheers.",

            "content": "Mel Gibson's fifth directorial effort Hacksaw Ridge comes a decade after his last feature film Apocalypto. Coming through the cloud of a controversial decade-and-a-half marked by personal turmoil and public controversy, Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge seems to reinstate a sense of purpose for the beleaguered filmmaker. Gibson's film follows the true-life story of Desmond T. Doss (portrayed by Andrew Garfield), an American conscientious objector, who served in World War II as a combat medic but refused to carry or use a weapon due to his pacifism as dictated by his beliefs as a Seventh-Day Adventist Christian. In keeping with Gibson's filmmaking tradition, he merges history with a strong personal theme to center Hacksaw Ridge. Like 1995's Braveheart, Hacksaw Ridge boasts an epic setup to convey the violent history the film itself is set in, but simultaneously undercuts its own pacifist message as it plunges into a barrage of over-the-top violence that feels more in line the 1980s Rambo bloody action trope than exploring the harsh realities of \"war as hell.\"  \n\nFrom a storytelling point-of-view, the film commits rather shocking carnal sins in-regard to dialogue and development. Aside from Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Doss and Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Doss' father, the overwhelming majority of the film's supporting cast are surprisingly underdeveloped, lacking fully-formed identities that contribute to the development of the character or the story. Meanwhile, the casting decisions in certain areas are downright puzzling particularly Vince Vaughn's rather unconvincing performance as an Army Sergeant or Sam Worthington's blank, expressionless performance as an Army Captain. \n\nThe dialogue of the film is extraordinarily forced and trite, sounding as contrived as the most amateur screenwriter could make it sound. Gibson's directorial instincts enhance this triteness with musical cues that seem to announce the dramatic underpinnings of the situation whether it be romance or terror. The story development is just as abysmal as it in the most ham-headed way possible, presents Doss' upbringing, Christian faith and family life in a manner that omits and reduces the very detail and characterization that are meant to serve the main character's motivations as well as the basis for the story itself.  With an exceedingly poor screenplay, Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge fails the most basic test as its built on an exceedingly poor frame that its aesthetics cannot make up for. Ultimately, Hacksaw Ridge should've been hack-sawed and tossed into the garbage it amounted to the very moment its mediocrity passed across a desk.",

He wants to serve as a medic.\n\nThe first third of the movie provides plenty of backstory but the movie really starts chugging along when he joins.  And the war scenes, which are basically the second half of the film, are memorizing.   Mel Gibson directs and does a hell of a job displaying the brutality of war.  Some of the scenes remind me of We Were Soldiers (another good flick).  And some of scenes rival the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan...possibly the greatest 15 minutes of war movie making ever made.  High praise for sure but I think warranted.  There is an unmistakable beauty in this violence.  It's not violence for violence sake.  War is brutal but out of this brutality there is a light...this medic...who believes that he is protected by his savior...and he was.  It's this balance of brutality and morality that is interesting.  \n\nI highly recommend this movie and it well deserves an oscar nomination.",

The first half is the weakest, plodding along through a series of rote conflicts and stereotypical character arcs.

Gibson knows exactly where to point the camera, how and when to move it and how to co-ordinate a huge battle scene. The sequence on the titular ridge is one of the most spectacular action sequences in recent memory, and when it's over you feel like you've been in the heat of it all along. It may not quite stack up to war classics like Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now, but it tells a compelling story, giving us a protagonist who is humane, morale and steadfast, even in the most terrifying of situations.",

We see the gradual development of the protagonist from small town kid to his struggles at army camp, but the movie really hits you when we first see the team on the battlefront, where we all witness the true monstrosity of war together.\n\nMake no mistake, the war scenes are brutal, they're tense and most of all shocking (although I should add, my feeling of nausea was heightened due to the strange and gentle whiff of urine in the Cineworld I attended).\n\nThe film also steers clear of making any overt statements - a difficult task considering that religion and war are tackled throughout. It's likely that you will interpret the themes in the movie based on your own existing beliefs.\n\nAside from that, the acting is great and the cast make each character engaging.\n\nMy only complaint was the use of some shoddy CG work. Luckily (or weirdly) this only seemed to be the case in non essential scenes - I'm guessing the budget all went on the battle scenes.\n\nOverall I left the cinema drained and astonished as I processed the fact this this was a true story.

Indeed Mel never really delves deeper into the ideals he explores, and consequently I never truly cared. It would seem in the end, this great story is more of a mask for his morbid fascination with gore and 'good old fashioned American heroism,' and that sadly left me feeling little impact or emotion at all.\nVERDICT: Hacksaw Ridge is a well made film for sure; it's just a shame it fails to get to the bottom of the real hows and whys to build a thing that makes you properly care. This story surely deserves that more than any.",

He gets nice support from the rest of the cast, particularly Vince Vaughn as his harsh but understanding drill sergeant, and makes great use of his comic abilities.  Behind the camera, Mel Gibson crafts a straight forward but still powerful tribute to Doss, detailing the hardships he faced sticking to his beliefs while not condemning his fellow soldiers who didn't share them.  The battle is especially well done and like \"Braveheart\" & \"Passion of the Christ\", Gibson doesn't glorify violence but depicts it brutally that you should recoil at it.  Thus, like an great war film, it's one that condemns war for it's horrible violence but also pays tribute to though who fight in it.  A great film and perfect tribe to the heroics of a true American hero.",

The relationship of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) with his girlfriend is full of clich\u00e9s, but this is not serious because these were typical behaviors of the time. Although Garfield's interpretations are far from being the best, he succeeds in providing a fairly accurate approach to this \"real story\", which is more like a complete rendition of Gibson who was very clever in using a story so full of greatness and courage to bring it to the big screen. The shots are excellent and the music very well selected, which is typical of Gibson. Battles are not easy and this is a reminder of what you can face under a scenario that is so real and so overloaded with brutality, violence and yet patriotism, steadfastness and security on personal convictions and ideologies. 76/100",

Going into bloody war without a single weapon except his medical kit, Desmond Doss became a faith-based hero and a man who defied odds. This movie might become one of the most Chirstianity converting films in years. The man's faith is necessary to his character and he wins the skeptics over with his sheer devotion to what he believes. Andrew Garfield imbues his real-life character with heart and strength simultaneously and delivers a career-defining performance. If anything falters in the film, strangely enough it would be the direction and screenplay. In the first half of the film, before we arrive on the battlefield, Gibson makes some clunky directional choices and the screenplay in the first half, especially with what Vince Vaughn was called to do, is humorous in all of the wrong places. Luckily, when the film hits its stride in the war front, things are mended and the gritty and inevitably violent second half is terrifying and immersive and one of the most beautiful moments of film I saw in 2016 involved Garfields' Doss taking pity on an enemy soldier and fixing him up despite the obvious separation of sides. Hacksaw Ridge has a strangely lazy moment for every five or six great ones. The man is given his tribute and it is a mostly satisfying one. Rating: 72",

I suppose this just highlights Garfield and that's the whole point to the film. \n\nIt's gripping and entertaining film!!",

Strange (but authentic) Southern accents coming out of recognizable British and Australian actors. Bible bashing. Mel Gibson (directing)! However, as the film switches briefly into a legal drama before the full on war extravaganza, it becomes a totally different beast. There is a strange and clever logic working here: quietly old-fashioned scenes at home followed by a tense but controlled legal battle that tests our protagonist's faith and principles when he volunteered during the height of WWII but refuses to bear arms and would only serve as a medic saving, instead of taking, lives. Just as the film pulls the audience onside, they are thrown in the deep end in the most horrifying and visceral way as the onslaught begins - there is no holding back here in terms of the portrayal of war and all its hideousness - we see and feel those principles, not only tested, but literally endured and ultimately rewarded. Andrew Garfield, once again venturing into Japan to test his Christianity (now the go-to guy after the recent Silence) gives a strong, understating yet heroic performance while Gibson shows he can direct the heck out of those unrelenting battle scenes with clarity and precision, matching Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan scene by bloody scene. There are a few hokey and dodgy parts: Vince Vaugh's Sargeant Comedy feels jarring at first and little bits of gunghoism or religious symbolism seep through from time to time, but this is essentially a rather well made war film that depicts but not glorifies the dehumanizing violence and instead shines the light on one person's reaction to all that is happening around him with selfless determination, faith and humanity.",

The man deserves a Best Director nom!\n\nIf Andrew Garfield isn't AT LEAST nominated for an Oscar, it will be a travesty. This is Andrew Garfield's movie, but aside from him I was most impressed with Vince Vaughn. I've never seen him take on a roll like this and I think he pretty much knocked it out of the park. He has some great lines that had me laughing out loud. While his character in this film does have some comedy aspects to him, it's not the typical Vince Vaughn role that we're all sick and tired of. I also really liked Teresa Palmer. Her role was small and she wasn't on screen all that often, however when she was on screen I was very impressed with her performance.\n\nI need to discuss the battle sequences...wow. The battle sequences are absolutely masterful. I've seen quite a few War movies and in my opinion this is the most realistic portrayal of War that I've seen in a movie. It's so brutal and so realistic. I just sat there completely still with my hand covering my mouth for the entirety of the battles. Hacksaw Ridge is one of, if not the scariest film I've seen it 2016.

            "content": "\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is the best war film since \"Saving Private Ryan.\"  Director Mel Gibson has captured the heart of this tale about a soldier whose patriotism led him to enlist, even though his religious beliefs prevented him from touching a weapon or fighting on the Sabbath.  I am probably most impressed that Hollywood allowed this film's strong Christian message to hit the mainstream without being mocked or criticized.  Granted, it's message could factor into the Oscar race but I hope that it will earn recognition through some much deserved nominations and wins.  The film does everything right from its acting and score to the limitation of special effects (to enhance the realism) and straightforward storytelling.  The story takes places in basically three different chapters.  It creates an immediate attachment to Desmond Doss with a cute love story, explores the complications of his convictions through the training sequences, and then shows his heroism on the battlefield.  The war scenes are pretty brutal and give a vivid insight into the treacherous conditions on Hacksaw Ridge.  Be prepared to see legs being blown off, bullets tearing holes through bodies, and men being set on fire with flame throwers.  It is difficult to watch but will also enhance your appreciation for the veterans who have served our country in battle.  The cinematography and script work hand in hand to create a visual depiction of the attacks that is easy to follow.  The score by Rupert Gregson-Williams works on multiple levels as it enhances the love story, facilitates the drama caused by Desmond's convictions, and paints the hopeless atmosphere of Hacksaw Ridge.  The thing that ties all of these details together is an Oscar-worthy performance by Andrew Garfield.  The combination of his accent, emotions, and dedication to the role will make you think that you are watching the real Desmond in a flashback.  He has a great supporting cast around him, including some great moments from Sam Worthington and a stunning performance by a nearly unrecognizable Hugo Weaving.  He brings an impressive amount of subtle emotions to the emotionless, shell shocked father that contrast the moments where his emotions must escalate.  Vince Vaughn seems like a horrible casting choice for a drill sergeant (we all wish that we could forget the \"Psycho\" remake) but he brings just the right amount of comedy to the role while transitioning into the serious character necessary for the war scenes.  Finally, Teresa Palmer has the perfect look for a 1940's love interest.  Our perception of Desmond hinges on the love story humanizing him at the beginning of the field and the chemistry between Garfield and Palmer is perfect.  \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is not easy to watch (mainly the second half) but it is worth enduring the blood and gore to get to the strong themes of religion and patriotism that permeate the bleak hopelessness of this battle.",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge is Mel Gibson's comeback film. After half of a decade of banishment from Hollywood following a string of leaked audio tapes revealing Gibson to use violent, racist and anti-semitic language, it appears that he has been absolved of his sins by the Hollywood elite, and has been given one more shot at success. He comes back to silver screen as a director, with a film many have placed into the category of conservative-freindy films. Films like American Sniper, 13 Hours and Patriots Day, that play extremely well with audiences across America and provide soaring box-office returns, but are scoffed at by films critics as being cliche, jingoist, patriarchal.. you name the buzz word. But perhaps Hacksaw Ridge finally bridges the gap between the film snobs, and the filmgoers. No, Hacksaw Ridge is not a movie only a Trump supporter would love. It tells a heartbreaking, inspiring story of courage, faith and unwavering love for humanity.\n\nDesmond Doss is a man many Americans strive to be, and quite frankly, fail. He's a man of deep faith, who enlists in the army to fight the Japanese in WWII. He would be the ideal marine, except for one thing.. he refused to pick up a gun. Desmond is the ultimate pacifist. His religion teaches him never to kill, even on the battlefield. To the chagrin of his division, he is demoted as a combat medic.\n\nThe story unravels slowly, as we see Desmond in times before the war romancing a young southern belle played by the stunning Teresa Palmer. As well as his problems at home with his alcoholic, WWI vet father, provided by a tremendous performance by Hugo Weaving. Comedian Vince Vaughn appears as the drill sergeant, who brings his quick wit to this drama, and does a fabulous job. The sweet moments of the film's beginning seem sort of cheesy. But then, Desmond leaves for the war and with an anaconda grip, you are sucked into his hell on earth.\n\nWe are taken to Okinawa, and the carnage begins. Hacksaw Ridge is by far the most violent film of the year. It's a war film that is unafraid of showing all of the blood and guts. You'll be taken completely aback as it begins. Heads get split open, torsos get cut in half, legs are blown apart. The nastiest aspects on this horrible war are on full display, but perhaps more disturbing of all, is the shell shocked Desmond, who fights with all of his might to do his job, and save his fellow men. One by one, he fills them with morphine and takes them back to the base. \"Lord, give me one more\" he chants to himself. Desmond Doss is an unmistakable American hero. This is a moving picture. I hope that people can still be moved by a picture like this, but in this divisive climate, it is hard to say if that is even possible. As of this moment, we have never been farther apart, and we have never been more cynical as a country. But what we know far too well, is that we must honor the brave men that came before us that died protecting us. We enjoy our lives on the graves of men like Desmond Doss, who risked his life and his dignity saving us from the evils of fascism. His story is one that we desperately needed to hear from.",

The actors were surprisingly talented, especially those not known for such a serious tone. 7.5/10",

            "content": "Review by Zanele Arlington Jiane\nHacksaw Ridge should be added as an apologetic (A reasonable defense) for Christianity while at the same time it should really not have been made into a movie, it should not have been made into a movie because all Desmond ever did was live out his faith to the best of his abilities, something all Christians ought to be doing anyway, the movie shines because Christians fail dismally in loving out their faith and Doss appears to be a hero, an honor he refused and attributed his heroics to God and to the many soldiers who served his country. Why are so many Christians like Non-Christians in terms of worldliness? I think there are many reasons one of the main ones being Emperor Constantine becoming a Christian and everyone to be in line with the emperor adopted Christianity so they can advance in the ranks of the empire.\nIt is remarkable that Gibson a staunch Catholic chose to film a life of a Seventh day Adventist, this is some maturity on his part, I know many Catholics and they dislike the Catholic church and sometimes have the worst adjectives describing it. The Catholic website classifies the seventh day Adventism as a \"Unique Christian sect\". Mel Gibson had many biases to overcome in order to make this film it seems.\nThe message of the movie is that Christianity has a voice and it is a unique one because initially it is counter cultural and looks offensive and it is never adequately understood until bears its fruit, many who reject Christianity reject that which they do not understand, the fear of the unknown taking its course.\nThe movie begins with an enlivened war scene and take us into a small town in Virginia, USA where Mr. Doss (Hugo Weaving) pays tribute to his brothers in arms who died during an earlier war, we are then introduced to his family and our protagonist as a boy and we see the events that shaped his convictions. Hugo Weaving gives a powerful performance, when he was discussing enlisting in the army with Andrew Garfield he reminded of a scene in Lost (TV Series) that won Terry O'Quinn an Emmy, Higo weaving reminds us what fathers are for in a very powerful scene as a master negotiator. He inhabited his character fully, Garfield has shown us his range as an actor in The Amazing Spider-Man, even here his role is stretched a bit, his Spider-Man persona still lingers as I half expect him to don his suit. Teresa Palmer is the most beautiful actress I've seen wearing a nursing uniform and her scene with Garfield on the question of marriage was amazing.\nThe film is star studded and has Sam Worthington with a very powerful bass voice that commands respect, Vince Vaughn gives us the films funniest scenes with him as a staff sergeant.\nMel Gibson emptied himself in this movie as the Icon Production logo screen was not even shown in the beginning, even though they did distribute this movie and the only hint that it's a Mel Gibson movie is right at the end of the movie as the credits roll, he wanted the story to tell itself.\nThe filmmakers have done their homework as the cemetery is under a massive tree with a wide canopy covering the tombs below, the location team did a sterling job. The end credits show us a glimpse into the real Desmond Doss.\nThe film's running time is fair and the visuals are impressive the opening scene is among the clearest scenes ive ever seen in film, the horrors of war are done in a dignified manner unlike Fury (2014) where a tanker drives over and flattens a dead body, this is not decent.\nI saw this film with a very quiet audience as there were many powerful scenes and besides occasional giggles, there was no response to its magic, a sad experience.\nMel Gibson did Christianity a huge favor by making this important film and I can say I am challenged to live out my faith without fear.",

It is based on the true story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector to the war who joined the army but refused to hold a weapon, wanting only to help save lives as a medic, not take other lives (a decision based on his own devout religious views).  While the Army hates his position on this and try their best to get him to leave, he eventually succeeds in his plan to become a medic, and ends up showing some of the most bravery of any man, saving the lives of 75 wounded soldiers he helped evacuate on his own while on top of a ridge held by the Japanese.  It is a great story, and while I personally don't buy into the whole God theory, I see this as a great story about a man who accomplished much. Faith was indeed a factor in what helped the man accomplish what he accomplished, but somehow the notoriously Christian Gibson doesn't overly play that hand, he doesn't preach or make it too mystical.  It can be read without feeling that a message about the wonders of God, and that is what makes it a pretty good war film.",

He won't even dream of laying either an eye or a finger on a rifle. If today's superheroes can't help us through gun control, then this real-life hero of Hacksaw Ridge can.\n\nJust the first opening sequence alone is enough to tear your heart open and make a home there. Images of the battle on Hacksaw Ridge show the brutality of the historical event: there are more corpses than living souls, rats have arrived to feast off the remains, blowtorches incinerate whoever is left alive, and the heavy-handed music reminds you of what each soldier had to leave to fight for the important things.",

In a blatant attempt to right all previous (personal) wrongs, director Mel unleashes an American flag wave to end all American flag waves. It's a tsunami.\n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" tells the astounding true life tale of World War II, enlisted pacifist Desmond Doss, the first decorated soldier who refused to carry a weapon. As platoon medic, Doss was solely responsible for returning 75 casualties from battle at the horrific Okinawa conflict. The film shines during this ridiculously heroic ordeal - a superhuman feat carried out under terrifying circumstances - with heart racing tension.\n\nThat is a great movie, but unfortunately there's a very clunky, stereotypical, corny, introductory movie tacked on as well. Instead of revealing the complex Doss character through his war actions, Gibson visits his apple pie small town past to introduce an abusive, alcoholic, shell-shocked father, and a devoted, squeaky clean girlfriend - two major characters who are sorely out of place in what quickly turns into a gritty, violent, body count flick.\n\nThe compulsory basic training portion of a war movie is executed thoroughly with its cast of colourful characters, who against all odds, overcome their differences and prejudices to become a close knit unit. It's classic war movie making 101. Folks eat this stuff up.\n\nBut when heads explode and legs are severed, folks throw that stuff back up. Gibson has made a pretty good American war epic, hitting all the red white and blue buttons for the generic audience at large, but he missed the boat, cuz with some editing, this could have been truly extraordinary.\n\n- hipCRANK",

            "content": "\"With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it don't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together.\"\n\nThe terror and brutality of war has been a subject of many movies for years. Many consider the 1998 Steven Spielberg movie Saving Private Ryan the best and most realistically brutal depiction of war. However, that may change with the recent release of Hacksaw Ridge. Directed by Mel Gibson and starring Andrew Garfield, this film outlines the story of Desmond Doss, a pacifist who joined the American army and saved many soldiers despite refusing to to use or carry any type of weapon. This film has incredible battle scenes with realistic, brutal and graphic onscreen deaths. The film's directing is clever in how it focuses on close ups on the soldiers and their deaths. There are few times when the camera shots display the overall army which makes the story feel more claustrophopic and personal. Having the film's story focus on the carnage and dead bodies on the battlefield also adds to the horror of war outside of the actual action of it. There are some extremely grotesque and graphic depictions of dead or dying bodies. The sounds on the battle also convey the horror and insanity of the battlefield. This atmosphere creates actual tension and suspension on the survival of the various characters of the film. The way the battlefield is depicted aides the heroics of Doss. This character is played exceptionally by Andrew Garfield. He gives possibly the best performance of his career. He is friendly and likable but also knows when he needs to stand up for himself. He conveys his beliefs in a way that makes him appear noble. He does not force his beliefs upon anyone or try to convert anyone, he simply wants to be able to practice them. This adherence to beliefs is an important message that is effectively expressed. The rest of the cast fits their role as well. Hugo Weaving actually gives a sincere heartfelt performance as Doss' alcoholic and war torn father. Weaving is able to depart from his normally villainous or evil performances to give an emotionally jarring performance as a man who is struggling with alcoholism and the abuse this causes his family. While his accent sounds off at times, he still is able to convey the emotions of a father attempting to make amends to his family and protect his sons from the destruction of war that he has experienced. Similarly, Sam Worthington as Doss' commanding officer has the most clear arch of the film and completely disappears into the character. Luke Bracey is also able to elevate his character above the generic bully character when he is given a backstory and starts to respect Doss and his philosophy. Possibly most interesting is Vince Vaughan as Doss' sergeant. The normally comedic actor who normally struggles in dramas, and has struggled in most of his comedies the past few years, gives a good performance. His combination of humorous insults and actual moments of intimidation makes Vaughan play to his comedic skills while not breaking the serious tone of the film. Aside from the performances and cinematography, possibly the most interesting aspect of the film is how accurate it is. Apparently, the real person this is based upon did not want a movie made about him since he was worried about accuracy. However, this movie is nearly completely accurate in every detail. With the exception of a few inaccuracies that can be attributed to the way the film presents the scenes, it is impressive how accurate this film tells this real life story. Unfortunately, the way the story is told is a negative aspect of the film. There are many characters arches that feel rushed or incomplete. Some characters, like Ross' brother who was extremely important in the beginning of the film, disappear entirely from the plot. Additionally, this film is two and a half hours and it honestly feels longer. This movie's pacing drags at various areas of the film. Particularly towards the end of the film the pacing slows and the scenes become repetitive. Also without spoiling anything, the ending displays what should be an important scene through precredit text which detracts from its impact. Hacksaw Ridge is a film that is able to balance pacifist, Christian morales with some of the mist realistic and brutal depictions of war in cinema history. Despite some pacing issues and rushed character arches, the film has great performances, particularly by Andrew Garfield, and is a great return of Mel Gibson as a director. I would recommend Hacksaw Ridge to those who want to be inspired by an incredible American hero who stuck to his beliefs even in adversity but are not made uncomfortable by extremely graphic violence and mutilated, decomposing corpses.",

The battle scenes bring back memories of Saving Private Ryan, whilst Gibson uses a touch of 'The Passion of the Christ' in delivering nuanced, Christian imagery from behind the camera.\n\nLong after stepping out of the cinema, the message that will stay with me and many others, is one of integrity, values and ethics.

            "content": "More-so than lingering on Mel Gibson's involvement with this film and its success, more attention should be focused on Andrew Garfield's emergence as a budding star actor.  in the tail of Hacksaw Ridge and Desmond Doss, Garfield portrays a man who stood tall for his convictions even when everyone around him was practically forcing him to do everything against them to survive in the Army.  What we learn from this film isn't an argument for or against religion, but to one's own faith in what you believe.  Whatever it is.\n\nHacksaw won't be billed as a top-level war-time film like the Saving Private Ryan's or Black Hawk Downs of the world, but it delivers a solid cut scene of one aspect of the entire war dealing with one specific incident.  At times, the pacing is tough to determine exactly how much time as passed.  Did all of this take place in two days?  A week?  A month?\n\nWhat this movie did a fantastic job of was focusing on Doss's plight.  His story is incredible.  Whether they embellished some of it or not, you can't help but feel those pangs inside of you for there being someone like Doss on America's side in those times.\n\nUnfortunately, because it devotes nearly all of its time to this one man's story, there are only flashes of building this movie into something on the level of the films I mentioned up above.  We get a brief glimpse at the team and supporting characters around him, but none of them get fleshed out or they run into one another leaving the audience trying to figure out if we met that character before or not.\n\nThe violence is poignant and pretty well done.  The sound effects are all there and the bang bang scenarios some of these guys were involved in really do come across as harrowing.\n\nHacksaw Ridge won't break any barriers on the war-front standard on the silver screen, but it does a fine job enlightening us to a real-life pacifist's journey through a troubled time back in WWII.",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge (2016): The Brutal Mel Gibson Is Back\n\nIf you are reading this review you have probably seen The Passion of the Christ (2004) or at least heard of it and the controversy it stirred over the gruesome brutality Mel Gibson unabashedly portrays on screen. For obvious reasons, the film could not wear the \"true story\" badge that, 12 years later, Hacksaw Ridge (2016) proudly does. This time, Gibson takes his Christ to World War II to tell the modern-day miracle of American corporal Desmond Doss, a religious and peaceful young man who despite his refusal to bear arms or commit any act of violence, saves the lives of 75 soldiers in his division during the Battle of Okinawa.\n\nThe film features an incredibly diverse cast; Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington, Rachel Griffiths, Luke Bracey and Vince Vaughn, all pushed to limits I never thought they would reach. Who would have thought that the sweet boy-next-door Peter Parker has been carrying so much unnoticed potential? He may not look like the real Desmond Doss at all, but his innocently childish face renders the purity of Doss's character, and his emotionally fierce performance conveys the vigor of his faith. However, the person whose presence is felt the most during the 140-minute-long movie is Mr. Gibson himself; his brutal and raw energy becomes the moving force behind every single shot. While watching the film, I caught myself unconsciously clenching my body in a fetus position as a way to fend off the violence on the screen. Gibson's violence is not the gory slaughterhouse kind that invests in feelings of disgust (that never gets me anyway); it is violence that brings our physical and human vulnerability to unprecedented proximity - he brutally invades the bubble of our reality to bring our insides out for everyone to see... meaningless, absurd, and vicious as they are.\n\nAlthough it has been described as a \"religious bomb,\" the way I see it, Hacksaw Ridge preaches faith not religion. I am well aware that Mel Gibson is an extremely religious individual, and I mean it dogmatically and aesthetically. Like it or not, you've got to respect him for his discipline as a director and his courageous indifference to Hollywood standards. In a time where miracles are ridiculed and our sole idea of heroes is sexy bodies in spandex suits whose superpowers are measured by how much damage they can inflict, Gibson shows us a real hero whose only superpower was his faith - a real hero who only wanted to save lives... all lives!\n\nFor those who could not understand his message the first time, Gibson is saying it again, louder and in a much more mature voice: we need to jump into the very heart of violence to really understand the powerful nature of love.",

The most significant if not the most impressive aspect of the entire film was the main character played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield shaking off his Spider-Man image and reminding us all he's an actor of a wide range. Much like other war films before it 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Black Hawk Down', 'Hacksaw Ridge' brings the out very graphic battle sequences that aren't suitable for any sensitive or squeamish viewers. Nonetheless the complex morality and and exploits of the film's main character make this film to be one of the most unique and compelling to date especially when focusing on little known history that's respectably presented on screen as it's fascinating and thrilling to witness. The end result is a film that not only reasserts Mel Gibson as a talented director but also a war film that celebrates the small victories of saving lives especially from a man whose never wanted or hasn't ever killed before. If that's not enough to recommend this film, especially given it's talented cast, outstanding cinematography and overall impact that doesn't quite make it a masterpiece but comes quite close, I don't know how else to frame it.",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge review. Well, I've found a new favourite Superhero film. That is absolutely what this war movie is, because the main character was a real life hero who stands in the company of very few amazing people. The movie starts feeling very much like Braveheart set in WW2. Lovely, noble people who fall in love and the whole thing feels warm and fuzzy. Be prepared though. That feeling doesn't last. The film takes its time to get to the action by setting up characters, family relationships, the tension in a small town and how important the main character's belief system is to him. Desmond Doss was an incredible human being who stayed true to his convictions against overwhelming odds, and then showed the world that faith can be your shield when you need to be brave. The climax of the movie comes by delivering one of my new favourite scenes from any movie. Doss stays alone when his whole company retreats to run into an artillery barrage to find his fallen friends. He is hunted by Japanese soldiers, chased into holes, is shot at by snipers and never picks up a weapon. Alone he saved 75 people that night. It is such an inspirational story that you come away feeling that the world is a different place. I wish I could have met this man and shook his hand. Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most gruesome and intense movies I have seen. Bodies are blown apart and cut in half by bullets, all without the levity that comes from a Quentin Tarantino film. Because of that I can't recommend this film to everyone. You may be too squeamish to watch some of the brutal, non-stop war scenes. But if you can see this movie you must. Desmond Doss deserves this sort of recognition and I know he would love to know that his story touched the lives of millions worldwide.",

For half of the movie, you're wondering why it's worthy of an R rating.  Even through boot camp, you see little blood, and only some light swearing.  This makes what's to come all the more haunting.  Almost at the flip of a switch, the horrors of war take over the screen.  No veils of prudence are used throughout the film's second half.  You will experience the horrors of WWII as vividly as any film to date has portrayed them.  I was hiding behind my hands, the chairs, even a scarf at one point of the film.  I'm decently sure I kicked the chair in front of me and elevated 4 inches out of my seat during a jump scare (or two).  Just before the credits, I was ready to write most of what was depicted as over-dramatization of actual events, but once the credits roll and you hear from the real life hero himself, all doubt vanishes.

Mel Gibson has created a very well done film about a young man who refuses to fight but wants to help his country in its darkest hour. Andrew Garfield's Desmond Doss is a man who believes whole heartedly in the Word of God. Despite that and refusing to touch a gun Doss still wants to join the armed forces in fighting the Japanese overseas. After plenty of complications a troubles in keeping his morale during basic training he does end up among the ranks of the United States Marine Corps on Okinawa. Here the movie really comes to life with the absolutely relentless horrors of war time in 1945. Packed tightly with loud artillery and a few jump scares the audience and myself found ourselves on the edge of our seat the whole time.\nThe first act of the film was set in Desmond Doss's hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia. Times are changing in America, as everyone already knows, as World War II continues to rage on. Desmond's brother, Hal, feels the push to join and help his country so he goes to enlist himself. This is troublesome for the father of the Doss family as he is a veteran of the first World War. His scars, while not plainly visible, are there emotionally. Because he lost thereof his friends in the war he fears that he might lose his sons as well. This does not phase Desmond and he goes to enlist as a medic because he is a conscientious objector. Before he goes off to bootcamp he asks for his girlfriends hand in marriage, a girlfriend he had met only a few days earlier. In my opinion I thought this was probably the worst act of the film. I think it suffered mostly from being simply too long. A lot of the scenes in the first act were unnecessary in retrospect. Thought the light, lovable tone of the first act serves a purpose later in the film, many of the scenes were not needed. One thing that Mel Gibson did do well however is how he portrays the father Tom Doss (played by Hugo Weaving). Weaving's character is portrayed as both a drunk and an abuser of his family. After a fight between Desmond and Hal he beats Desmond which pushes their mother to reinforce the Sixth Commandment in their house. In another scene Tom attempts to murder his wife before Desmond intervenes and almost kills him. This leads both Desmond and Hal to disobey their father without second thought when they join the military. The Tom Doss character as a whole was very well done and though it seemed cliche at first it did serve a greater purpose.\nThe second act that took place at basic training for the 77th Infantry Division of the Marines. Vince Vaughn plays a tough and hard-nosed drill sergeant that doesn't take kindly to those who don't follow orders. Because Desmond Doss is assigned to Howell (Vince Vaughn) he turns the company against him even before he gives him a chance. This second act is a great preset for the looming battle ahead. This act doesn't fail where the last one did as it is excellently paced and even adds some humor into the film. This act also introduces the theme of never giving up on what you believe. Desmond Doss finds himself on trial for disobeying orders from his officer during this act. But he does not waiver his faith even in the face of jail time. Because he does this his father shows up vouching for him to fight and help the United States. The panel of officers who hold Desmond's trail have no choice but to oblige. This act was heartfelt and pulled at heartstrings even though we all knew what was coming next.\nThe final act of the film was by far the best and most powerful. When the Marines show up to Hacksaw Ridge it looks like a place out of a horror story. The only way in and out of the battle zone was up a ladder tied to the face of a cliff. At the top of the ladder what laid before the soldiers was nothing short of hell. Seeing as this movie central theme is faith in God this seems like only a fitting setting. The next forty-five minutes of the movie kept my heart racing the whole time. Because Mel Gibson did not use music through the first parts of the battle scene the sounds of gunfire and artillery and screaming filled the theatre. It was chilling to listen to while horrible scenes of people burning alive and explosions filled the screen. I think the movie that came before this probably made this last part of the film feel more uncomfortable. Because the rest of the movie had a sort of a lighthearted tone this counterbalanced this part of the film because it was so dark. Gibson did a fantastic job on the last act because he used Hacksaw Ridge as an extra character in the movie. The battle ground itself was a different entity than the rest and the main characters in the film wrestled with it for a majority of the movie. I think it also served as a biblical tie for Desmond Doss. Where the first part of his life in Lynchburg with his wife and his family might have been heaven, Hacksaw Ridge was most certainly hell. And as he walked through hell, still following the Word of God and keeping true to himself, is when he had his finest hour. On the ridge Doss saved countless men, most of them had written him off early in bootcamp. Another biblical tie can be found in that as well. One of the Bibles most famous phrases is \"turn the other cheek\" and Desmond Doss does that as he saves his friends that once heckled him and doubted him earlier.\nIn the end, when me anomy friends I went to see it with were pleasantly surprised. Mel Gibson masterfully mixed two of his most famous films, We Were Soldiers and Passion of the Christ, and made an even better film than those two. Gibson, who rarely disappoints left me and my friends more appreciative of our veterans. I expected a lackluster film, to be honest. I expected a film to come out this late in the year to merely a plea for Oscars. But, in fact, it wasn't and it was film that I would even go see again. At some points it dragged in and at others it was hard to watch but like I said before in the end you leave with a new appreciation for our soldiers. Mel Gibson and his crew have fluently stitched together a hearty war film with a theme so tender that it pulls at you heart and leaves close to tears. Hacksaw Ridge was probably one of the better movies I have seen in my lifetime.",

This time he directs a WW2 film that tells the true story of pacifist medic named Desmond Doss, who saved the lives of 75 men during \"The Battle of Okinawa.\" This film may not rank up with Mel Gibson's best movies but its got a lot of heart and has some of the most brutal war scenes you will see to date. \n  Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is a Christian man who comes from an abusive home, falls in love, and goes to war. We see this kinda stories often but this one is a little different. During his enlistment as a medic, he refuses to use a rifle. His moral beliefs are then tested when he is in the hellfire of battle. \n  Andrew Garfield does an extremely well job with Desmond's character. He is likable and committed to his beliefs. His accent is also sharp and mannerisms are very believable. The other two performances that really stood out was Vince Vaughn as Sergeant Howell and Hugo Weaving as Tom Doss (Desmond's father.) Vince Vaughn starts out as a Sergeant in boot camp and has some funny scenes but plays a serious man. He usually doesn't take on too many serious roles but this one was one of his best. Hugo Weaving is also surprisingly good. He is an alcoholic father, suffering from PTSD. His emotions are haunting and Hugo plays him with such commitment. \n  Now this movie does start off slow. We see Desmond's life and how he falls in love with Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) as well as his time in boot camp. When we finally get to the battle scenes, they are often terrifying and it keeps you on the edge. This is real gruesome stuff and uses shocking imagery instead of glorifying action. It's realistic and brutal and forces us as viewers to witness how war really is. However, despite its realism of battle the direction plays it safe in using traditional camera work and not much creativity in the cinematography like \"Saving Private Ryan (1998)\" did. \n  Now this movie is more than just warfare but it's about love, faith, and courage. Desmond was a remarkable man staying true to his beliefs of god. He saved many lives regardless of fatigue and gunfire. This story is remarkable. There are some problems I have with it, though. The religious themes are big in this movie. Sometimes it feels like its suppose to be a moral movie of pacification, but we get a film full of gore and violence. It's hard to get the sense of what it wants to be but alas it's just the true story of a man who saved many lives. Then I do have some issues with the special effects used. There is a scene where you see cannons firing from battleships that don't look realistic. The CGI did not look good in those scenes, as well as some other scenes which are harder to notice but they could have done a better job. There is also some things that are not in the movie such as Desmond's actions in previous battles. We only see his couple days at Hacksaw Ridge, which is fine but I did wanna see more of his efforts before hand. \n  I'm giving this review a little late since it's been in theaters for awhile, but I'm glad I got to see it. This movie is well-acted and will often leave you tearing up or cringing. It's haunting and beautiful showing that one man can make a difference. It shows that there is light in all the fog of the world. Go see it, if you haven't already because you don't wanna miss this one.",

            "content": "From the beginning to the end, this movie keeps your attention and it is very difficult to move away from the screen. Mr. Mel Gibson had done an excellent job bringing forth a discussion not easy to have. A conscience objector in the military is not an easy connotation to add to one's name. The main protagonist is a conscience objector. He has made a decision to do his part for the war effort. However he refuses to use a weapon to kill. He wants to save lives. Of course his superiors looked at him as a coward. The Army does his best to get him removed from its ranks.  But they can't stop him. The private and medic in the Army managed to finish his training and goes to Korea with his platoon.  The battle is ferocious and the Japanese inflicts death in high numbers to the Americans.  Under enemy fire the medic saves 75 wounded soldiers. He becomes a hero.\nWhat makes the movie so extraordinary is a correlation of a traumatic childhood due to the main character' father own demons.  The father too fought in the field of France during WWI. Hunted by the ghosts of war, the father seeks refuge in alcohol. The protagonist has witnessed violence in his family, and once almost kills his brother. One night he stops his father from being violent to his mother. Something stirs in his heart and he makes a decision to bring forth repentance and a solid faith. This faith is very clear when he rescued the wounded soldiers. He prays to God for the strength needed to save each injured soldier. \nThere is one more aspect related to his faith. Before he leaves for training, his girlfriend and later on wife gives him a Bible. He holds on to the Bible and he is never far from the book and prayers. I think he understood that when hell is ahead, you better hold on to God to do what others deemed impossible. To enter hell and walk the same route backwards carrying wounded men on small shoulders, 75 times, without firing a single bullet, requires the deliverance of the power from above - Great movie.",

            "content": "A good old-fashioned war drama about true-life young American hero in WW2 who didn't believe in killing a man or even holding a gun... but still wanted to serve his country so became a battlefield medic instead.\n\nHe rescued a lot of fellow soldiers and got Medal of Honor without shooting out a single bullet. Starring Andrew Garfield - and before you google or IMDB him, yes, he's the current Spider-Man.\n\nHacksaw Ridge doesn't really bring anything fresh to the war drama table. But it's not necessarily a bad thing because for all the cliches and simpleness it also manages to be one of those beautiful event movies which win us over by just how well they are put together in every aspect.\n\nThe battle scenes are as brutal and eye-catching as expected but I especially liked how the movie manages to work on different levels.\n\nIt reminds us that war was hell before it was all entertainment for the younger generations - but it also manages to be sweet and kind of feel-good, praising the good in our souls which can make us rise to the occasion and make the most of the bad situation. And, of course, action fans will not leave disappointed either.\n\nIt's also amazing how soulful performances the actors offer based on quite shallow one-dimensional characters.\n\nGarfield is a true star here, giving his all as a boy not quite a man but ready to do man's job - all starry-eyed, idealistic and physically resembling a young calf at times - yet never giving up on personal quest to be worthy of own's ideals. You will totally buy him as a young American hero.\n\nThe supporting cast is strong too, especially Hugo Weaving as the hero's troubled father and Vince Vaugh as sgt Howell.\n\nIt is kind of ironic that after years and years of yawn-inducing talky roles in mostly mediocre comedies, Vaughn has found new calling in serious, violent stories such as \"Hacksaw Ridge\" and the mafia man in HBO's \"True Detective's\" season 2.\n\nThis is also kind of comeback/renewal for Mel Gibson, one of the more likable movie stars from the end of 1970's to the beginning of 2000's.\n\nIn the middle of 2000's, he suddenly stopped acting, directed two violent historical movies (\"Passion of the Christ\", \"Apocalypto\") and turned from a longtime family man and father of seven to seemingly homicidal maniac, if we believe the news and notorious recordings made by his neighbors, leaked to web.\n\nHe's returned to acting in 2010 but has been keeping lower darker indie-er profile ever since, so many of you have probably not seen him in anything new. Except maybe cameo-ing in Machete 2 and The Expendables 3. This time, he's \"only\" director and does a marvellous job at that, putting everything together and wringing the most out of the cast.\n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" may not be remembered as one of the greats in crowded war movie genre but it's working beautifully in ts own right. Two hours well spent.",

All classics in their own right. Although Mel Gibson's 2016 Hacksaw Ridge doesn't quite stack up amongst the aforementioned films, the award-winning director has produced an accomplished work that is moving, uplifting and depicts the strength of the human spirit. With a very clever premise that is based on a true story (put someone in a war who doesn't believe in violence), the content shown is horrifying and hasn't been expressed in the cinematic medium quite like this. Gibson manages to keep the tone (and tension) at a perfect balance which is anchored by great performances by Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Hugo Weaving, Luke Bracey (quickly making you forget about 2015s Point Break) and Vince Vaughn. Being out of the directing game since 2006s (under-appreciated) Apocalypto, Gibson has dusted off his hat and has again shown his amazing ability with Hacksaw Ridge-a good old fashioned picture that will impress and is a worthy entry in the war genre.",

Instead, Gibson makes Doss' character easy to accept, without adding any 'supernatural' aspects to it. It would have been tempting, especially considering what Doss survived and achieved, not to mention Gibson's own religious views. \nThe cast is fantastic, especially Garfield, but also including a surprisingly great performance from Vince Vaughn.

For sure, I'll never forget your anti-Semitic rants or your unwavering support for your father after his own outspoken statements denying the Holocaust. Your film, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, was way over the top, both in its portrayal of Jews and what you see as their role in sending Jesus to the cross too. It was unfortunate that the Anti-Defamation League made such a stink about the film. Had they just kept quiet, only devout Christians would have gone to see it and you wouldn't have made a tenth as much money on it as you did. You could say that the very people you hate were the ones who were ultimately responsible for putting so much money in your pocket.\n\nBut that's history and it seems that you're now on a path of redemption, keeping your racist opinions to yourself and focusing on your craft. Your latest film, HACKSAW RIDGE, is mighty good and you deserve the praise you're receiving for it. Is it worthy of a Best Picture Oscar (R) though, or are you deserving of a Best Director Oscar (R)? Hollywood does love a comeback, which is what you have achieved with this film but Hollywood is also controlled by Jews (sez you) and, while we like to forgive, we don't like to forget. It would seem that Jewish Hollywood has given you that most Christian of attributes - forgiveness, but we'll have to wait until the end of February to find out how forgetful the Academy voters are.\n\nNow about your film, it is one of the best films I've seen so far this year but it's not without its weaknesses. I understand that it tells the true story (as opposed to being \"based on a true story\", which implies some element of fiction) of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII, who became the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty. Doss (played by Andrew Garfield, THE SOCIAL NETWORK) was a Seventh-day Adventist. When America entered the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, young men and women all over the country enlisted to fight. Doss also wanted to serve his country but he steadfastly refused to carry or use a firearm or weapons of any kind. This stance raised the ire of both his sergeant (played by Vince Vaughn, WEDDING CRASHERS) and captain (Sam Worthington, AVATAR), who tried to get him drummed out of the army on a Section 8 discharge. When that didn't work, they had Doss arrested and tried for insubordination. Doss' father (played by Hugo Weaving, THE DRESSMAKER) came to the rescue though. A veteran of WWI, the elder Doss reached out to his former commanding officer who was by that point a general. Pacifism, it turns out, is protected under the US constitution. Although Doss was allowed to return to his unit, he still faced a huge hurdle from his colleagues who didn't like him or trust him.\n\nAll that changed when the unit was shipped off to Japan to participate in the Battle of Okinawa. There, they had to climb the cliff face of the Maeda Escarpment, nicknamed \"Hacksaw Ridge\", and engage the enemy who was well ensconced on the top. It was a brutal campaign that lasted for weeks (or days, as depicted in the film) with heavy casualties on both sides. During a lull in the fighting, Doss scurried around collecting his wounded comrades and rappelling them down the cliff face to shocked medics below. Working throughout the night, he single-handedly rescued over 75 soldiers, many of whom were so badly injured they most certainly would have died from their wounds if not for Doss' heroism.\n\nIt's an amazing story that one wonders why it wasn't told ages ago. It turns out that various efforts had been made over the years to bring Doss' story to the big screen but for a number of reasons it never happened. For starters, the screenplay sat in \"Development Hell\" for over a decade. Gibson himself turned down the opportunity to direct the film twice before finally agreeing to do it. Then there was a problem with funding. In the end, production took place in Australia with a largely local cast (not to mention the director himself) in order to qualify for government tax credits there.\n\nUnfortunately, all these factors played into some of the film's shortcomings. The story is very old fashioned and seems to be somewhat anachronous for today's audiences. World War II ended 71 years ago and the reasons for going to war have changed since then. Could a Doss exist in today's world of Iraq, Afghanistan, the Taliban and ISIS? All the Australian actors putting on their best American accents, not to mention Virginian accents for some of them, is a bit strange too. And the scenes of Fort Jackson in South Carolina are too Disney-fied to seem real. On the plus side, Garfield arguably does his best work ever bringing a Forrest Gump-like charm to Doss. If it weren't for the footage at the end of the film of the real Doss (taken before his died in 2006), we would think Garfield's portrayal was too hokey to be believed but we can see that the actor got the character right.\n\nAs for Gibson, he brings his usual heavy-handed mix of gratuitous violence, blood and Christian imagery to the film. There is no shortage of scenes of mangled bodies displayed in all their glory while rats run around feasting on the entrails. War is hell and nothing is held back to remind us of that. There is also plenty in the film that will give ministers and preachers heaps of sermon fodder for months to come. Characters seek forgiveness, find redemption and turn to G-d throughout the story, but the most blatant image comes at the end of the film when Doss himself is hoisted down the cliff face after being on the receiving end of a Japanese bullet. Injured and bloody, the camera shoots Garfield from below as if Doss is ascending to heaven as his earthly work is complete. The symbolism doesn't get more obvious than that. But, to his credit, Gibson knows how to tell a story and keep it interesting throughout.\n\nAll in all, HACKSAW RIDGE is thrillingly good entertainment though. If you can handle the religious overtones not to mention the gore, it's well worth your time and money. Damn you, Mel Gibson! It looks like you're back.",

I have to say that my naturally skeptical mind casts doubts on the accuracy of the film but that takes nothing away from the fact that its a ripping good yarn, told in the most graphic way, rather like one of those old fashioned war comics coming to life. For sheer action and adventure you can't get better than this.

Then I remembered who directed this movie and it follows if you followed Mel Gibson's last directorial offerings (Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto).\n\nAccordingly there is a religious component to this movie that felt a bit obnoxious to me rather than touching (again, that missing the emotional connection for me).\n\nThe ending also felt a little left out there, rather than wrapping it up neatly, either with a triumphant homecoming, or war buddy reunion years later or some such closure technique.\n\nWhile some of these parts dinged up the movie for me, overall I enjoyed the movie and the story of the protagonist is fairly awe inspiring.

            "content": "Serving your country. \u00a0Based on a true story, this is about a combat medic in World War II named Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). \u00a0He did not believe in killing and refused to carry a gun, but he also wanted to do the honorable thing for the United States in wartime. \u00a0This is his story about how he completed his training and saved a ton of lives in Japan against all odds. \u00a0I think that there is one reason why this isn't being pushed harder as the next Saving Private Ryan\u00a0and that\u00a0solely is because this is directed by Mad Mel Gibson. \u00a0You can say what you will about the man's personal life, heaven knows that the media has, but the man flat out knows how to make a tense movie, and that is exactly what he has done with Hacksaw Ridge.  Along with Gibson, there's a bunch of people here who desperately need a hit. \u00a0Andrew Garfield has got the talent, but Spider-Man did not pan out like he thought it would, and you can tell that he wants to put that behind him and is ready to be taken seriously. \u00a0Sam Worthington is arguably the most generic action star next to Jai Courtney, and he's actually inspired in this. \u00a0The person who impressed me the most in this would have to be Vince Vaughn. \u00a0I do not consider to be myself a big fan of his comedy, and more often than not, I actually don't care for his movies at all. \u00a0He knocked it out of the park in this. \u00a0He plays a\u00a0sergeant, and while he doesn't take it to those extreme dehumanizing levels that R. Lee Ermey did in Full Metal Jacket, he does bring exactly what is needed for this role. \u00a0In fact, if he did push the envelope further, it would have made this feel less grounded in reality, so I have more respect for Vaughn for knowing where to draw the line.  This is going to come off as very high praise, but this is like the first half of Full Metal Jacket meeting the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. \u00a0While it is never as groundbreakingly brilliant as those two movies to be sure, it really isn't that far off. \u00a0In addition to being this brutal, traumatizing war movie, it does also have a religious angle to it as well. \u00a0Even though I don't consider myself to be very religious or spiritual, I really appreciated the subtlety to it, and this never feels the urge to bash you over the head with Jesus. \u00a0It also helps to give the character of Doss a plentiful amount of dimension. \u00a0He's a man with a code, which is always a relatable thing in movies; it's why Westerns usually work as well as they do, and it is also why Batman is so cool, but I digress. \u00a0This is excellently made, and there is some terrific sound mixing that really made me feel physically ill when everything started to go down. \u00a0It puts you right there in the trenches with the soldiers, and I was jumpy from the moment they ascended the ridge all the way to the end credits rolling. \u00a0I love the moral quandary presented to this man, and I think this is one of the best movies of the year.",

            "content": "Powerful war film from director Mel Gibson. I always feel like I have to qualify my admiration for Gibson as a director due to his personal views, attitudes, and actions, but he is an amazing filmmaker. In this film, Gibson tells the true-life story of WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss, who served in the Pacific theater as a contentious objector, refusing to pick-up a gun, but who earned a Medal of Honor for single handedly saving 75 wounded soldiers. The film does follow the standard \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" formula of back home, to boot camp, to the big battle. Although the film does dip into cliches at times, Andrew Garfield's performance is so sincere, he transcends the cliches and manages to make the film feel true and honest despite being corny at times. Once the film gets to the battle scenes, there is nothing corny about this film. Gibson is a smart director, but his real gift is shooting action and battle scenes. As with \"Braveheart,\" the battle scenes in this film are something truly to behold. They are terrifying, brutal, and absolute visceral experiences. Stephen Spielberg directed the very memorable and intense US invasion of Normandy, but that is nothing compared to the battle scenes in this film. The battle scenes here are worthy comparison to those in Stanley Kubrick's \"Paths of Glory.\" I honestly do not think war has ever been depicted on film in such brutal terms before. I'm not sure I would classify this film as an anti-war film, but I think it is more about bravery and sticking to your beliefs, though the depiction of the horrors of war are pretty rough. The real life Desmond Doss turned down offers to make a movie of his heroics for decades because he did not think Hollywood would give an accurate depiction of war. There's no mistaking that this film would have met Doss' standard for not glamorizing war.",

            "content": "This is the kind of movie that affects you long after you've seen it. The war scenes are horrifying, probably the most violent ever captured on film. At some point, they became so disturbing that I started crying. There's something very realistic about them I guess, and still, I'm not even remotely close to feeling what soldiers have to go through on a battlefield and \"after\". And this is probably something you don't ever wanna imagine.\nHacksaw Ridge starts off dramatic, develops into a sort of romance, turns out to be quite funny and humorous during the middle of the movie (loved Vince Vaughn in this one), until it shifts to an action packed, but also quite serious and scary mode. The first time we meet \"Hacksaw Ridge\", officially known as the battle of Okinawa, there is nothing but hell to be expected. When the soldiers are walking over all those dead and torn bodies through that dusty fog, there is something very terrifying about it, but also brilliant in directing.\nOverall, Hacksaw Ridge is an anti-war film. The theme of compassion is very pronounced, futhermore, there is a recurring theme of forgiveness, reconciliation, and that judging others is wrong. Mel Gibson did a rather good job here, and I absolutely loved Andrew Garfield in this movie. He truly surprised me. There is something so humble about his performance, it's hard to describe.\nThe cinematography is amazing, and there's an unusual sensitivity with incredibly crafted action under a most moving story. This film really demands attention, and nerves. I strongly recommend you to see it though.",

            "content": "The second world war has been depicted on film hundreds of times over the past 70 or so years, with some adaptations earning a place in cinematic history while others barely registered as a blip on the radar. In his first time back in the director's chair since 2006's 'Apocalypto,' Mel Gibson brings to life the story of conscientious objector-turned-Medal of Honor recipient Private Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) - an army medic who single-handedly saved the lives of dozens of fellow soldiers without firing a single shot.\n\nNow, many in Hollywood can hide behind the tired phrase \"based on a true story,\" but in this case, the \"based on\" is not needed. As many will concede, films that have strong storylines and themes that tie what happens on-screen together in a coherent way are generally thought to be among the better ones when compared with mindless, messy movies that we often see. In 'Ridge,' however, Private Doss' story is so compelling that everything from his violent upbringing with his drunkard father to his realization that his faith calls for never harming another living thing makes for a great central focus in 'Ridge.' In fact, Garfield's performance is such a step up from what he's shown audiences in the past that it's no wonder there's a lot of Oscar buzz around him at the moment.\n\nWhile a film about the events on Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa would not have been as strong without an individual like Doss as the focus, the supporting cast definitely brings its A-game here. Sam Worthington stands out for his portrayal as a nay-saying captain who at first cannot accept Doss' aversion to holding a weapon, while Vince Vaughn takes another step toward diversifying his acting portfolio in a serious role as a drill sergeant that pales in comparison to the likes of 'Full Metal Jacket's Gunnery Sargent Hartman. Theresa Palmer also impresses in her supporting role as Doss' love interest, but it is Hugo Weaving who steals the show as Tom Doss - a WWI veteran who causes his family so much pain, yet comes through in a big way when he needs to most.\n\nAside from the strong story and above-average acting, 'Ridge' benefits from amazing cinematography, as the horrors of war are captured in life-like reality. While it's unfair to put it in the same league as 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Ridge' is one of the most brutal glimpses into what it was like to engage in hand-to-hand combat in WWII, and viewers almost feel like they are standing on Okinawa watching everything go down - for better or worse. There are also a few moments that are either so crazy or horrible that it's hard to imagine they're true, and while Hollywood is of course known for exaggerating plot points to drive something home, you can't help but imagine the majority of what transpires did in fact happen. And, finally, the score is one that stays with you long after you've seen the film - always a good sign.\n\nIt's true that many have a hard time looking beyond Mel Gibson's personal shortcomings, and will either refuse to see 'Hacksaw Ridge' or admit that it's any good. Despite this, there's no denying that this film is one of the best entries in the war/combat genre in a long, long time, and should absolutely be considered a frontrunner for the forthcoming Academy Awards. By communicating a story that resonates globally and focusing on themes such as respect for life, standing up for your beliefs and the \"no man left behind\" mentality, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a film that has the potential to (and should be) admired and celebrated universally.",

Because the film's latter two-thirds is nothing short of one of the most breathless, violent, and invigorating war film experiences I've seen in quite some time. Gibson's directorial prowess throughout this sequence is so absorbing and effective that it very easily removes any memory of the shortcomings dwelling within the film's opening moments, giving the viewer the inspiringly resonant they signed up for.

It could have been a faithful film of the Pacific Theater and the Battle of Okinawa. A true and reaonable homage to Desmond Doss and his acts of valor. Instead it spoils like milk and becomes a god-ray filled messiah film  that'd make a Renaissance great blush. \n\nI was holding out hope for this film, it's about a theater of war that should be hallowed territory for all Americans.  Instead Mel Gibson's delusional nature fails in this too, just like so many others. Hacksaw Ridge can take its place at the gallows among its ilk with the anti-semitism of the Passion of the Christ, and the gratuitous gore fest and grievous historical mishaps of Apocalypto.",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead. This afternoon I figured I would take in a movie and then find seven or so geocaches before it got too dark. I wanted to see Hacksaw Ridge for a while since the previews looked okay, and I knew little to nothing about the film. In fact I had no idea it was based on a true story (spoiler). Anyway, Hacksaw Ridge follows the story of Desmond Doss, who because he was a Seventh Day Adventist, refused to use a weapon in war... and he got away with it. He goes to Okinawa (apparently not the only places he went, but we don't see the other places) and has to fight for Hacksaw Ridge, a large cliff area the Japanese heavily defend. \nThe movie shows Doss's past, and his enlistment in basic training and how he refuses to hold a weapon and faces a couple of beatforces including Vince Vaughn, his drill sergeant. \nI was honestly waiting for the film to speed up. I'm like, I realize that some of this is important, but for the most part the first half is slow. Then we go to the battle scenes, which were well done aside from the sheer ridiculousness of it all. I told my brother that some of it seemed unrealistic, as in there is no way in hell people would survive that. But I guess they did. There are some brutal scenes, and a lot of body parts all over. This was first shown to us in Saving Private Ryan, and by now, its got to the point where it's like yeah, I know, war is hell. Trying to gross me out like Fury did doesn't earn you points. I care more about story than gore.\nI did see a couple of continuity errors, and people getting shot only to be okay later. I was also confused with the two guys who look like Sam Worthington. I couldn't tell them apart at times, especially when their helmets were on. \nThe film ends kind of hea. Andrew Garfield gets his bible back, and he gets stuck halfway down the cliff but he's okay. He just says heaaa really loud and then the film goes into interviews with the real life people. It was only at the very end did I realize that the events in this film really happened. It kind of improved my outlook on the film at that point. Had I known that earlier, I may not have thought how ridiculous some of the action was.\n\nI thought the acting was decent, although I'm confused with some of the casting. I don't see Vince Vaughn as a drill sergeant. Granted he did the best he could with his short part, but hea. Sam Worthington is a beatforce (which is why he was in Terminator), and so are some of the other cast members. I'm not really sure what to think about Andrew Garfield. He did okay, but like Spiderballs, I'm not sure I like him yet.\n\nMel Gibson (who plays the voice of the bus driver) has done better films (Braveheart being the one that comes to mind), and this is no Braveheart. It is also not Saving Private Ryan. Some of the reviewers said this was the best war film since SPR. I disagree. There have been better (not American Sniper though, that film was kind of overrated). One of the biggest problems I had with this film was the over-use of slowmo. Just stop! If you need to show important action, please use another technique to show it. That's one of my pet peeves, especially if it is overdone. \nIt is, however, an okay film, but certainly not the best war film I've ever seen (SPR). I did enjoy the action sequences and some of the historical accuracy (not sure about how true most of it is though). It reminded me a lot of the Call of Duty 2 opening level at Pointe Du Hoc in Normandy; except you don't have Germans shooting down from you on the ridge, who could have also just as easily cut the ropes. God why didn't they think of that. Stus. \n\nHacksaw Ridge will be in my top ten of 2016, but lower on the list. It gets a 3 out of 5. Subsequent viewings may be more forgiving but we'll see.",

After brutal hazing and a court martial, Doss was allowed to train as a combat medic and would participate in the Battle of Okinawa, where he saved the lives of over 75 men and would later receive the Medal of Honor for his uncommon valor.  He was an exceptional human being and a Virginian too!  What makes Hacksaw Ridge work as a film is the commitment of its director Mel Gibson, and Andrew Garfield as Doss in the kind of earnest and heartfelt performance you don't get much of these days.  Hacksaw Ridge also reflects the director's religious beliefs, as the main character's arc and the overall theme of the movie center around Christian redemption and grace.  But it also reflects Gibson's fetish for gory violence and ambiguous moralizing.  Some may complain of murky messaging, but I felt it was consistent enough to not break the picture.  I don't know if it ranks with the best of WWII films (Fury may be the best post-Saving Private Ryan film) but it's good enough to warrant a viewing.",

Not only was this film intense to a whole other level, this film has some amazing heart and emotion behind it. Andrew Garfield is spectacular as Desmond Doss. He is so likable and so empathetic and he really caries this movie. From what he had to endure for simply refusing to touch a gun to his heroics on the battle field, we  are right there with him. You just can't help but smile when he is on screen and falling in love with a nurse at the local hospital. He isn't the only good actor in this movie, though. Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington, and even Vince Vaughn are really well played and executed in this film. As for the battle scenes, you can watch all the war movies out there, (Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Fury, Black Hawk Down, American Sniper, you name it) you have never seen violence and intensity like this on screen. My jaw was on the floor. Mel Gibson really knows how to up the violence, the bloodshed and the pure shock value to whatever he films. Whether it be a battle in Middle Ages Scotland or the Death of Jesus Christ, Mel Gibson knows how to deliver the blood! Although, why this film? Why this story to tell? The moral of the story is that decent people in this world do exist who only want to help other people. How one man's courage and faith can save lives. Yes, this movie has some pretty heavy religious overtones to it, but when you see Desmond Doss running back to rescue all the wounded soldiers on the ground and praying to god for him to save \"just one more\" it's powerful stuff! That's the best way to explain this film, \"powerful\". How are the human relationships? Powerful. How is the emotion behind the events of the story and the actions of the characters? Powerful. Do you feel the death toll of war and the horrors of being on the battle field? YES, YOU DO! A powerful, powerful film that will move you in ways very few films can!",

One such person was Medal of Honor recipient & WWII veteran Desmond Doss. Hacksaw Ridge is the inspiring true story of one man's courage & conviction which led to his serving his country & saving the lives of seventy-five men in battle without ever carrying a weapon. The Amazing Spider-Man's Andrew Garfield stars as Desmond Doss, a young man from Virginia with a strong belief in God. Doss enlisted in the army as a medic to save lives rather than take them. During Basis Training under Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) Doss' beliefs cause him to be subjected to physical & mental torture by his fellow soldiers who want to see him discharged. Directed by Mel Gibson from the screenplay written by Andrew Knight & Robert Schenkkan, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most powerfully intense & captivating war films that I have seen. The battle scenes were gripping & gruesome. Andrew Garfield gives the best performance of his career. The performances from Vince Vaughan along with Tom Worthington as Captain Glover, Teresa Palmer as Nurse Dorothy Schutte, Hugo Weaving & Rachel Griffiths as Tom & Bertha, Doss' parents were all sensational. Look for Hacksaw Ridge to receive some major award consideration, including Best Picture, Mel Gibson for Best Director & Andrew Garfield for Best Actor. Hacksaw Ridge is a MUST SEE FILM.",

Andrew Garfield, in what very well could be an Oscar winning performance, brings a powerful humanity to Doss, both in the film's first half, which focuses on his struggle to remain in the army while remaining true to his personal convictions, and in the second half, which showcases his amazing heroics amidst some of the most graphic and realistic depictions of WWII battle since 1998's Saving Private Ryan. Say what you will about Mel Gibson's personal demons - he can still direct one heck of a movie. Hugo Weaving is outstanding as Doss' father. The ending, and its archival interview with Doss, will choke you up. One of the year's best.

            "content": "My Dad was nice enough to take me to see Hacksaw Ridge tonight. I went in with such high hopes, after all, how could I not? Look at the amazing WWII movies that have come before it! Movies like, Saving Private Ryan, Fury, Schindlers' List, and the HBO miniseries' like Band of Brothers and The Pacific! Unfortunately, for me, Hacksaw Ridge belongs beside Pearl Harbor. (warning, spoilers) Let me preference this, again, by saying this is just my opinion. Dad absolutely loved this movie and I'm glad that he did. But in my opinion, the religious aspect of Hacksaw Ridge was WAY too heavy-handed. What the real Pfc. Desmond T. Doss did during the taking of Okinawa was heroic in every sense of the word. But Mr. Gibson took his story and made it about his religion. Every chance he got, Gibson reminded me that \"oh hey remember how I made Passion of the Christ and how I'm super Christian now? Well here's another slow motion shot or mention of Doss' bible! Here's another shot of him reading his bible! Here's another scene of his fellow soldiers mentioning his bible!\"\nAnd while it's true, many men in WWII were very religious. However, you can make that part of a character without it being his main focal point. For example, Joseph Mazzello's portrayal of Eugine Sledge in The Pacific. He was a deeply religious man but it wasn't his only character trait. Also, the effort Mr. Gibson takes to make the messiah out of Doss was way too heavy-handed as well. Yes, the man himself is a hero. But tell the story of the man, the man who actually did these incredibly heroic things. The things that made him worthy of the Medal of Honor. Don't make it so his religion is what won him the Medal of Honor. \nMy second problem with the movie...the violence was far too comic. Slow motion explosions, slow motion body parts ripping across the screen, slow motion point of view shots from the side of a machine gun as it rips through Japanese soldiers. Oh and of course, a slow motion scene of, who I assume was, Mitsuru Ushijima committing seppuku as Okinawa fell around him. You know how Micheal Bay takes his movies and just makes them into 2+ hours of explosions? Well Mel Gibson now does the same thing except with blood and gore. Not saying that there wasn't horrific blood and gore on the sands of Okinawa, but the way it was executed in this movie was absolutely over the top and, to a point, comical. Oh and also, I counted at least 3 guys pulling grenade pins out with their teeth. Hasn't this been decided that this is the stupidest thing ever in war movies?? Those pins will rip your teeth out before they come out of a grenade! And Gibson decided to put this into his movie not once, not twice, but three times!!!\nIn closing...I went into this movie with such high hopes but left it feeling disappointed. Mr. Gibson's religion was shoved down my mouth almost more than when I went to see The Passion. The violence was done not to show the horror of war, but to show how realistic and cool blood, guts and limbs can look when they're flying through the air in super slow motion. If you liked Hacksaw Ridge, I certainly don't want to take that away from you. Nor do I put you down for liking it. In my opinion, it feel very very short of my expectations. Here's hoping Dunkirk is awesome.",

This young man from the country raised in a religious home and under strong morals goes into the army the one place where death surrounds you and he chooses not to use a weapon. He sticks to his guns never wavering in spirit and strength and he ends up being the guy that helps the army win the most difficult battle against japan in world II. Mel Gibson could not have picked a better story to tell on screen as its unlike anything we've seen in war film. \n\tThe movie which is based on Doss's real story starts out showing Doss at a young age and then as a man where he opts to join the war. He goes into the army with his ideals and as expected his fellow soliders, captains and lieutenants are perplexed and angry as hell. The movie takes a look at Doss's struggle to show his superiors and fellow men his way works as well and may even be the key to winning that important battle on hacksaw ridge. The film also looks at his family life including his marriage to his wife Dorothy.\nAbsolutely unreal motion picture, unbelievable! this is a story we should have heard more about. mel Gibson has officially completed his full comeback now. His directing was so extraordinary and visceral. He tells an incredible story of soliders and even just people battling their conscious their own morality. He covered religion and even taking life, saving it and enhancing it. his best work since braveheart. its amazing looking at that battle and seeing how it went and how doss really became the franchise player so to speak and stepped up to help the army. from so many closeup and slow motion shots you feel and witness the personal effect of the battle and the explosive and grim surroundings of Okinawa. tremendous cinematography. Gibson truly captured one of the toughest battles during WWII and Doss in general whom after watching this I view as a military legend and justa bonafide hero. \nThe acting in here must be commended. The cast was phenomenal. Andrew Garfield gives a career best performance. He captured so well Doss's unbreakable vow to stay true to his beliefs. His own sense of  courage and bravery that no one thought he had. Garfields raw emotion and wit are utilized so well here compared to his past roles. He will get an Oscar nomination for sure I have no doubt. Vince Vaughn surprisingly made me laugh again. he was actually comic relief in this mainly intense drama. Overall though he did a stellar job in this film. Teresa Palmer, Luke Bracey, and sam Worthington all were fantastic in here and pushed themselves further beyond acting wise here. They excelled greatly in their roles.\nthe score for this film was perfect. so emotional and intense and it just came out beautifully. the sound design was great everything was frantic, brutal hard hitting and the production design was also really great.\nthe film itself is a stroooong contender for best picture. one of the years best films for sure.",

Andrew Garfield is stellar in the starring role. This is hands down his best work yet. Hugo Weaving could get a supporting actor nod. The war sequences are so intense. Vince Vaughn was also so good which was surprising. So many one liners from him. Mel Gibson us back and isnt holding back. He has brought arguably his best yet. Probably my favorite movie of his.

The second half is about being a hero in the face of some unbelievable crazy and horrifying stuff going on around you.  Be warned, Mel Gibson does not pull any punches in the graphic, Tarantino-esque style of shooting this battle, and maybe he shouldn't.  It is rough though.

            "content": "The Top 5 Movies of 2016\n\n#2. Hacksaw Ridge - 5/5 Stars\n\nI recently went to a symposium about the role of men in society. One prevalent point was that men were both the main perpetrators and the main victims of violent crimes. It brought forward the role that violence plays in the development of a young man. In the olden days, a man was expected to be able to fight off intruders and wrongdoers and should the need arise, be physically capable of going to war against a hostile nation.\n\nOur society has changed to some extent, but the role of violence in a young boy's development is still present. Its not uncommon for some friend groups to insist that the guys know how to fight and for the girls to like a guy she can feel physically secure with. It's even seen in our modern role models, especially in the recent domination of superhero films. Very often its guys who use violence in order to save the world. These societal pressures give the impression to young boys that violence is good and necessary.\n\nHacksaw Ridge is about an army medic in World War II who was a conscientious objector, that is, he refused to use violence or carry a weapon. He saw that the world was suffering and decided that it was his duty to help in any way that he can. The first half of the movie dealt with the constant opposition he faced, not from the Axis powers, but from his own commanding officers who did not see him as valuable. He only had value if he could fight, a belief that would be true for soldiers and men in general at the time.\n\nThe second half of the movie shows him on the Pacific Front, having been allowed to go to war without a weapon. The battle can be described as a nightmare. Bullets flying everywhere, men being shot and dismembered and death far as the eye can see. Soldiers who were happy and prideful in the first half of the movie were reduced to either a corpse on a beach or a broken and injured shell. Was this what they were excited for? Was this what our main character fought to experience? Was this the great heroic journey that they were sold? The answer is no, and from these trials a true hero emerged.\nFor the remainder of the movie, we witness Desmond attempt to save as many lives as possible. Picking up wounded bodies, carrying them to the cliff edge and lowering them using a pulley to the command centre below, Desmond saves lives upon lives, regardless of whether they were friendly or not. \"Lord let me save just one more\" he would say as he bravely pushed himself into the battlefield, tired, weary but not broken. In the end, he is deemed a hero having saved the lives of dozens of men, by the same officers who stood against him. And he does this without firing a single shot.\n\nHacksaw Ridge does something unique. It shows young boys that heroism comes in many ways. You don't need to fight to be a hero. While violence was necessary in World War II, Desmond did not need to go against his morals to prove his worth. Andrew Garfield did an excellent job portraying his character and his performance is the heart and soul of this movie.\n\nHacksaw Ridge hooked me from beginning to end and was one of the best war movies I ever saw, on the same bar as Saving Private Ryan. It initially held the #1 spot on this list, and it would have taken a masterpiece to beat it. However, 2016 wasn't done with me yet.",

In war, fathers bury their sons\".\n\nHacksaw Ridge may seem like another Oscar bait \"true story\" biopic that we get every couple of years. The trailers didn't help at all, as it made the film look corny and very award bait. But guys trust on this, it's nothing like that. There's nothing glamorous about this. When it was over, I left was speechless. This is such a great movie.\n\nSay what you want about Mel Gibson controversial past and behavior, but I think we must judge the art, not the artist. This guy is an excellent director and a great actor. And you have no idea how glad I am seeing Mel back, as he is the most talented man in Hollywood right now. The most impressive part of Mel's directing in this movie (besides the battle scenes), is he's decision of an old version approach to the film making. The movie literally looks and feels like it was made around the 50's. Also how Gibson would let actors deliver the emotion of what their feeling and it could meant a lot of things that isn't just terrified. It could be happy, regret, or just thinking of home. And I got all of that.\n\nAndrew Garfield is an actor that's been non-stop blowing me away recently. And he gives one hell of performance as Desmond Doss. I would say it's one of his best since \"The Social Network\". Even in the battle scenes I thought he was brilliant, as he had this scared, tired, but brave look to him. He's accent in the film I thought worked pretty well and wasn't distracting like I thought it would. The chemistry between Garfield and Teresa Palmer was so charming and sweet that it didn't came of too corny.\n\nHugo Weaving plays Desmond father in the movie and he was outstanding. Such a powerful and emotional heavy performance. Weaving is the type of actor that deserves so much respect. I mean, we all know him as Agent Smith, V, Megatron, Elrond, and Red Skull. But for him to give a small supporting performance as the alcoholic father who's dealing with conflicted within was quite moving.\n\nVince Vaughn was so good in this movie that I wish he would come back for dramatic roles, as I really did brought his performance in this. The comedic one lines were pure gold and it was very \"Full Metal Jacket\". But he isn't like that the whole movie. When he's serious in the movie, it actually works and doesn't feel out of place for the rest of the tone.\n\nNow the battle scenes in the movie...wow, it's pretty rough and disturbing. It's right up there with \"Saving Private Ryan\" for graphic and shocking depictions. What I always love in these type of War films is the loud sound, actors, and the camera work, which this movie nails at. I've heard some people say that the movie glorify's it's violence despite the theme of the movie being against violence. I honestly think these people have really missed the point here. All the battle scenes are depicted more as this horrible event than a flawless victory.\n\nAfter the movie was over, everyone in the cinema started clapping. The last time that happened was when in saw \"Up\" back in 2009. While I never saw the point of clapping or booing at a movie, but for this occasion, I'll let it Slide. The ending was a very nice touch and pretty heartfelt to honor the soldiers that fought in the war. It was deserved.\n\nI haven't got a lot of issues with the movie. But if had to pick, I would probably say that Sam Worthington Australia accent kept slipping in and out in a few scenes. And don't get me wrong, Worthington isn't bad in the movie, but he was pretty good. The same can go to some of cast (as most of them are Australia), but I can easily look past it as the actual performances were all great.\n\nOverall rating: \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is not perfect, but it positives really do weigh out it's flaws. It's the best War movie I've seen in awhile in terms of it's execution and pay off.",

            "content": "This could have been a great movie, but got caught up in the current form of Hollywood storytelling.  The movie provides background and a needless love story, that do little to advance the plot.\n\nThe movie spends way too long extending the main character's origins, while not developing the characters we're supposed to care about him saving.  \n\nThe scenes where he happily races up a mountain with his brother, then smashes a brick into his head minutes later turn out to have nothing to do with his abhorrence to violence.  We find out hours later that his promise to never pick up a gun came from a moment where his dad pulled a gun out during a fight with his mom, and after Doss wrestled it away he \"murdered his dad in his heart\".\n\nAnd as is typical with many movies, a cheesy love story was thrown in for good measure.  We didn't need to follow his courtship of Dorothy, especially when it's smushed in there unnaturally to provide a \"sense of motivation\".  Not every movie needs a love story Hollywood.\n\nThis movie should have started with Doss at boot camp, and with a little exposition we could have been brought up to speed with his reasons for being a conscientious objector.  I never really felt connected to the other soldiers, even Vince Vaughn who felt super out of place as a drill instructor/company sergeant.\n\nDesmond is supposed to have been compelled to enlist after the bombing of Pear Harbor, but the bombing or its impact on the people in Desmond's community is never shown.  We do get to see a newsreel of the Nazis when Doss and Dorothy are at the movies, but his reaction is fleeting.  There is no moment where it shows him driven into action by world events.\n\nIt also would have been good to get some time devoted to showing us the importance of taking the ridge.  What we get is a sentence along the line of \"Take the ridge to take Okinawa; Take Okinawa to take Tokyo\".\n\nThe enemy is the typical generic army.  There is one scene where the Japanese commander, while facing defeat, chooses to commit seppuku, but we don't get to know him, or the purpose of the ritual so it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe heart of the movie was Doss going into a brutal battle, refusing to carry a weapon, and after his unit retreated, stayed on the ridge saving as many wounded as he could.  After risking his life, and proving himself a hero, he goes back into Hell with his unit again to complete the mission.\n\nThe movie ends with some real life interviews with Desmond Doss, his brother Hal, and some of the men who survived taking the ridge.  God bless all those brave men who fought to protect a free world.",

We all know the story by now of Mel Gibson's troubles over the last ten years, even while he was making \"Apocalypto,\" but now it's time to movie on and embrace the true fact that Mel Gibson is back! And thank god! The movie business just isn't the same without him, and as a huge fan of his, I must say that I am very grateful he's back in the game. Mel Gibson comes back strong with his World War 2 movie \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" which tells the story of Pvt. Desmond Doss, a combat medic who is also a conscientious objector. Who refuses to carry a weapon in the brutal war between America and the Japan. It causes quite a bit of uproar against his combat buddies, since they are all relying on each other to save each other's lives by killing the enemy. And the fact that Doss refuses to carry a weapon because of his strong religious beliefs, raises many eyebrows and questions to why he will not carry a fire arm in the mist of battle against the Japanese. The truth is that there is a major back story to why Doss refuses to carry a weapon, and it all goes back to his childhood. Mel Gibson tells the back story beautifully! I won't give too much away, but it all has to do with the days of being a kid and witnessing his father played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving, feeling the tremendous pain of the things he saw fighting the Germans in World War 1. And sadly wishing he wasn't alive, and hating himself tremendously through the process of indulging in alcohol to try and kill the pain. Because of this, an incident happens not only between Doss and his father, but with his younger brother that tremendously impacts Doss as a child. Making him realize that to take another human life is a tremendous sin. Which is what leads him to becoming the man, and the hero who ends up saving countless lives in the battle of Okinawa, 1945. Andrew Garfield of Spider-Man fame and David Fincher's \"The Social Network,\" which was his break out performance; takes on the title role of Desmond Doss. And I must say, he's definitely up for an Oscar nomination for his performance as we totally believe in every frame, every scene, and every moment that he is Desmond Doss. No other actor could have taken on the title role, as Garfield inhabits the character so much that at one point we no longer see Andrew Garfield. We see Desmond Doss. Garfield is so convincing as the character that he even nails the Doss's southern Virginian accent to a tee! We are definitely watching something epic from an actor who is just getting his feet wet in the business, and still hopefully has much more to come. Especially with Martin Scorsese's religious drama \"Silence,\" which comes out later this year. But most of the credit without a doubt goes to Mel Gibson, as he definitely directed this movie with a passion and displayed the realism Steven Spielberg showed us in \"Saving Private Ryan.\" Bullets are literally flying everywhere in the second half of the story where the war part takes place. You literally feel yourself cringing in your seat in the theaters as we men getting shot left and right in every direction to the point where you really start to feel that ANYBODY. Even the main cast could be struck or killed at any moment. That's the level of genius we are dealing with behind the camera. I still think \"Braveheart\" is Mel Gibson's masterpiece, but this is without a doubt a close second to other two films he directed before this such as \"The Passion of the Christ,\" and of course \"Apocalypto.\" Gibson does an absolute incredibly job at showing us the graphic horror of war and how scary it is for a young man serving his country to be in combat, especially fighting an enemy that doesn't believe in giving up. But the real theme surrounding this movie is faith. Faith is the core that guides this movie and Desmond Doss to rescuing over 75 men that day in the battle of Okinawa. It's something that we never hear. A rarity to even hear that a man as young as Doss was at the time to go above and beyond to save his fellow man. The movie is also filled with an incredible, yet surprising supporting cast such as Sam Worthington from \"Avatar.\"  Teresa Palmer as Doss's love interest and future wife before he goes off to serve his country. And of course Vince Vaugh as their drill sergeant Howell, who is absolutely fantastic in the role. Vince Vaugh was in every shape and form perfect for this movie as Garfield as when the movie starts to slow down a bit; Vince Vaugh is right there to pick the movie back up to full speed. If there is anything to be said about this movie, it is the fact that is absolutely amazing what one man is capable of doing when he has faith by his side. And it's something that we can all take away from the film that no matter what, always stand by your convictions.",

            "content": "It goes without saying that the true story of Desmond Doss is incredible and inspiring on every level. I would recommend it 100% based on that alone. But Hacksaw Ridge is simply a textbook study of surehanded and meticulous filmmaking. Just as with his other films, Gibson shows an almost obsessive understanding of how to communicate a story using the human body. He paints stories with faces, eyes and hands in a way that few other directors do. His style is classical but surreal. The hills and mountains of Virginia are photographed  with as much surreal beauty as Middle Earth. The war scenes are nightmarish hellscapes filled with severed limbs and nonstop screaming. Anyone expecting thrills from the war scenes here will find something much closer to a horror film instead. Gibson paints a very unflattering picture of the battlefield, using a lot of the same tricks as Passion of the Christ; he lets us peer deep into the eyes of soldiers filled with violent hatred without pulling the camera away - a sight that is far more terrifying than the countless severed limbs and blood sprays that paint the screen red.\n\nHe even takes an unflinching look into the heart of the story's hero, Doss, suggesting that his hardlining pacifist stance is not due to moral superiority, but his way of combating his own deep-rooted capacity for horrible violence. This portrayal of Doss sees himself as a murderer waiting to happen, and looks to his Christian faith and a lifestyle of peacemaking to keep this horrible beast chained up.\n\nThere's a lot of other great stuff in the film as well; Doss is an example of someone whose refusal to compromise on his prinicpals is rewarded with persecution, isolation and physical pain. The film warns that convictions are costly, but the results speak for themselves. That's not to say it's preachy, though. So much of what makes Hacksaw Ridge profound and insightful is not what's written on the page but what is written on the actors' and extra's faces as this now legendary story plays out.\n\nFor me, this is not only my new favorite war film of all time, but probably my favorite film dealing with issues of faith and violence. It's certainly the best thing to come out of 2016 so far. If you can stomach the circus of horrors that awaits you in the 3rd act, I would strongly urge anyone and everyone to see it.",

            "content": "Putting aside his personal life, Mel Gibson is a great director & has a knack for big scope pictures based on true stories.  Now is Hacksaw Ridge the next great thing from the infamous director?  Maybe, maybe not.\n\nAs I say about a lot of genres these days, we don't get a lot of great war films.  We just don't.  Free State of Jones, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, and even 13 Hours haven't been great.  But I was hoping Hacksaw Ridge would reinvigorate the genre, and perhaps reinvent it.  To a certain extent, it does.  A story about a Seventh-day Adventist who wants to join the army as a conscientious objector makes for a different way of telling a World War II story.\n\nI think the problem here is that the first and second halves of this story feel like two completely different films altogether.  The first mainly deals with Desmond Doss' (Andrew Garfield) budding romance with Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) back at his hometown of Lynchburg, Virgina.  I really bought into the cuteness and sincerity of that relationship, but it gets lost entirely in the second half.   I think I would have preferred more of a balance between a straight romance story and a straight war film.  And not a split down the halfway mark of the film, I mean each aspect sprinkling into each other.\n\nI can't deny how impressive Gibson's ability to direct intense battle sequences is, however.  Braveheart has one of the most beautifully shot finales of all time, and there's plenty of that to go around in the battle sequences here.  The fact that Doss' beliefs prevented him from being able to pick up any sort of weapon and he managed to save over 70 men during the Battle of Okinawa.  The story is remarkable and watching Doss relentlessly saving one person after another when everyone else had left, is definitely inspiring.  But I think the rush of it all overwhelmed my enjoyment of the battle, considering the first half is a different film entirely.\n\nVince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving, and Rachel Griffiths round out the cast nicely and add other levels of emotion to an already fascinating story.  But if I had to change something, it would be the pacing and direction from Gibson.  If Gibson could have found a way to sprinkle in romantic scenes to the unsettling battle or the other way around, the film would have been more fluid and even.  Other than that, this is definitely a film worth seeing in theaters just for the remarkable performance of Garfield alone.\n\n+Cute romance\n\n+Comradery at the Army base\n\n+Performances all around\n\n-Uneven direction, pacing\n\n7.5/10",

In the beginning you begin to know the Main character Andrew Garfield , Also know as Spider-Man. He plays a southern boy from Virginia much like Desmond Doss (WWII Medic) . His character is charming, cute, funny and passionate towards God. Once he joins the Military , that is when you are introduced to his Sgt played by Vince Vaughn . Vince was hilarious, serious, and war driven in the movie . He played his character very seriously and well. Once they go to war on Hacksaw Ridge the film making is superb, so realistic and stays right in eyes level. Portrays the characters so well . Lots of feelings and emotions . I cried at least 4 times, Laughed my butt off - Cried and laughed at the same time . When Andrew Garfield saved those 75 men , it was a feeling of hope, bravery, and many many other emotions . Not once did he pick up the gun but only to use it as a crutch to carry out a soldier in combat \"literally\". The story is deeper and the characters have a lot more character than I have given them credit for. Be prepared to cry - laugh- laugh and cry, and feel - you will feel a lot of emotions in this film. 2 thumbs up to Mel Gibson. If I had more thumbs I would raise them too !! Impressive Work <3",

Andrew Garfield does a great job in his role as the pacifist, and his love interest, Teresa Palmer,  does well in her role.

            "content": "In one of the most gripping war movies of the 21st century, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a valiant tribute to Doss, while also being one of the most realistic, yet graphic war films out there. \n\nDesmond Doss fought for our country, risking his life, and single-handedly saved 75 men during the battle for Okinawa. He did all of this with the morales that he would never touch a gun and that he would never kill another man. He ran into the battlefield without a single weapon to protect him, and this is his story.\n\nI uh, I left this movie speechless. It was so difficult to formulate my thoughts after a film like that and I didn't even know how to react. I was stunned. My breath was taken away. I was on the verge of tears. This is by far the best war film I've ever seen throughout my short-lived life. This was the most intense, one of the best written, and easily the most graphic war movie I've seen thus far. I even timed this perfectly with Veteran's Day, which I felt would be a great tribute to those who fought for our country. \n\nIf we're to start somewhere, we'll start off with the violence of this movie. This is the most graphic and realistic depiction of a war battle that I've ever seen. \"Lone Survivor\" was gritty, \"Fury\" was gross, and \"American Sniper\" was emotionally draining, but \"Hacksaw Ridge\" takes all your favorite elements from those films and puts them into one. The minute bullets start flying, things get real ugly real fast. The depiction of war is extremely ugly and it is difficult to watch at times. This movie is not for the faint of heart and shouldn't be taken so, as it shows that war is ugly, and there's not a single pretty aspect about it. The movie is gory, bloody, and realistic, and I praise it for that. \n\nThe performances in this movie were amazing. I've always loved Andrew Garfield, despite the flack he's gotten throughout his career. What I love most about him is his ability to bring out the personality of each character he plays, ranging from the little things to the big things. He makes his character unique and interesting and I think he pays such a great tribute to Doss. Doss was an odd and different man, but a noble one at that. I didn't realize that Teresa Palmer was in this film and although she didn't have a big part, she was fantastic. She stood out in the few scenes she was in and was a great compliment to Garfield. Sam Worthington also did so well and was better than most would've expected. But I think the biggest surprise in this movie was Vince Vaughn. I love seeing actors, especially comedic actors, take on a role that clearly strays form their norm. Vaughn's name hasn't been too hot the past few years, but his resurgence with this more serious role is a nice one. \n\nThe screenplay was amazing. I genuinely loved this movie and everything about it. The dialogue could've had a few tweaks in it at times but even then, I felt it was handled really well. When you fact check this film, there are some pretty glaring plot holes. However, they're not plot holes that come off as disrespectful. Mel Gibson added some things into the story and changed somethings for the sake of cinema, which I actually felt added to the story. It made the story a little more clear and just that much more intense. It doesn't pay disrespect to the real life events, but it enhances the message behind them. \n\nThe message and the overall meaning behind the true story is so amazing. It's honestly breathtaking and I am still so stunned. I still can't even formulate all my thoughts as I was literally blown away by this movie. This shows that war is ugly and the human race is ugly. But someone like Doss is so essential to this world. He provided this spark of hope that changed so much. Doss passed away years ago, and I wish I could've had the immense pleasure to meet him. This movie also greatly increased my respect for the military and what they go through.\n\nIn the end, this is one of the best war movies of the year. In fact, it's one of the best movies of the year. In fact, it's one of the best war movies I've ever seen. I loved this movie and if you really want a true cinematic experience and an amazing story, watch this film. I say again, this movie's not for the faint of heart, but it deserves to be seen. I only give a film 5 stars if it's truly had an impact on me somehow, and this movie clearly did just that.",

He's continually abused by his commanding officers and gets brutally beaten by his fellow soldiers. However, he refuses to quit so they try to court martial him. He is very nearly court martialed with a dishonorable discharge but a compromise is reached. He is allowed to go into battle without any weapon to defend himself with. What he does in battle has to be seen to be believed. If I tell you what he does you simply won't believe me.

It has the perfect amount of love, devotion, and kind of funny romance in it. Which were all actually a critical component of the story.\n   I and even my teenaged sons walked out of the movie declaring this movie to be in the top 5 movies they have ever seen. And we have watched many of movies. At the end of the movie, something happened that you rarely see happen. A standing ovation from the audience. It really was that good.\n   As a Buddhist and fellow medic, I was very pleased to know that this man refused to sell out his convictions and stuck to his guns (pun intended).\n   I and my family highly recommend this movie. Just be forewarned, younger children may find it disturbing, since it is extremely graphic. But only in regards to internal human anatomy. It is not at all sexually graphic.\n   Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Especially if you plan on joining the military.",

He navigates this complex and difficult story with ease, knowing the perfect ratio of character-driven moments to war-filled madness. The different aesthetic choices he made, in terms of the tone of the film and his approach to the different aspects of the movie, continue to prove his ability as a director. I'll get more into the war scenes later, but the way he chooses to showcase these sequences is masterful. Sure, we get tons of gory and bloody violence, but never does it feel glorified or for entertainment. It is purely to show the horrors of war and the madness that ensues on the battlefield, and Gibson walked that line perfectly. He also does fantastic things with the character of Desmond Doss, and how he uses other people's reactions to him to tell Desmond's story for him. Gibson easily could have had Desmond give us long, exposition-filled speeches about why he chooses not to kill, and we do get a couple of those, but only when they are absolutely necessary. Instead, Gibson utilizes supporting characters and the environment to paint the picture of why Desmond won't kill. It's a perfect example of show not tell, and I think it ultimately shows Gibson's mastery as a director...\n\nYou can read our full review here: http://www.themovieparadise.com/2016/11/hacksaw-ridge-review-andrew-garfield-mel-gibson.html",

Contant l'histoire d'un soldat qui refusa de prendre les armes, Mel Gibson prend les codes du genre (sa rencontre avec sa future femme, le camp d'entra\u00eenement et la derni\u00e8re heure totalement d\u00e9vou\u00e9e \u00e0 la guerre) et s'en sert bien. Chaque acte du film est r\u00e9ussi, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des acteurs remarquables comme Andrew Garfield \u00e9videmment, mais aussi Hugo Weaving, Luke Bracey et surtout Vince Vaughn en sergent instructeur. Mais la tr\u00e8s grosse r\u00e9ussite du film est le troisi\u00e8me acte, au coeur du combat. Ici, Mel Gibson s'en donne \u00e0 coeur joie, avec des plans plus inventifs les uns que les autres, un montage sonore assourdissant et particuli\u00e8rement immersif, une donne d'h\u00e9moglobine sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la moyenne et un sentiment de tension et de terreur rarement atteint dans le cin\u00e9ma de guerre r\u00e9cent.

Once the action does start its like from 0-100, Gibson does a breath taking job at capturing the brutality of war yet it isnt sloppy which can happen in alot of war movies.

Hacksaw Ridge has every characteristic that makes a great war film; great acting, great 3 dimensional characters, great character development, great snd gritty war sequences, and great writing that makes you feel like you're there witnessing and experiencing all of this in real life. Also, when I meant great acting I mean it, reason how I can prove it is Vince Vaughn is in this movie playing a drill Sargeant and normally I tend to notice Vince Vaughn in every movie he was in prior to this, now that's not a bad thing it's just he plays the same type of people in the same way over and over again, but here I totally forgot it was him throughout the movie and instead I saw a Drill Sargeant and this is due to great writing and a great performance. This could be proven, even more so, for Hugo Weavings character. Also, when I said the battle sequences were gritty, horrific and realistic, I meant it. These are the most realistic battle sequences I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. Though I could keep going on and on on how I love this movie and why, I'd better end it right here since I'm pretty sure you get that I love this film, but if there's one more thing that I need to add it's that Andrew Garfield as  Desmond T. Doss is probably one of the best casting decisions all this year, because he gives it his all and he's so believable as Desmond to the point where it's most likely oscar worthy  (boy he's come a long way from The Amazing Spiderman). So, in the end, I deeply recommend you to see this, it's one of the best war movies I've seen in a while and is probably going to be a contender in this years Oscars.",

This is a good love story and a redemptive story of courage. The war scenes are very graphic, so some may not care for that, but it does convey the horror or war. Andrew Garfield is the main focus and he is very good. The supporting cast all holds up their end of the show and except for a couple of hammy moments this is a very good movie. If you can't take the graphic violence of war you might want to pass, but otherwise a terrific movie.",

During the last hour, though, Gibson does some incredible things with the camera, while maintaining a nailbiting sense of tension that makes what came (nearly) slough off the movie as a whole. It's propaganda - as are most of Gibson's projects - but it is well done and thoroughly diverting.",

That was the case for \"Hacksaw Ridge\" last month at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nThe film is based on the true story of Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector, who ended up saving the lives of 75 Americans in Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, without firing or carrying a gun. Andrew Garfield plays Doss with bold conviction cutting to the heart of the character.\n\nThe film recounts Doss's childhood days and his enlisting in the Army, giving plenty of backstory that would shape the person that he is. This becomes the film's first act. Its second act takes us to the battlefield. Gibson does not shy away from the horrors of war and the violence that comes with it. As a director, this is where he is at his best - capturing the heroism and consternation of war.\n\n\"Hacksaw Ridge\" is about selflessness and standing by your own convictions especially when faced with so much resistance from the other side. The story of Desmond Doss and his military service is heartening. And when we thought that the stories of WWII have all been told, another one comes along and surprises us capturing our hearts and minds.",

            "content": "It has been a decade since Mel Gibson directed his last film. Almost as much time as there was between Braveheart and Passion of the Christ, but in this latest interval Gibson has unfortunately become more discussed for things besides his filmmaking talents. With Hacksaw Ridge, the story of WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss who refused to kill people as a Conscientious Objector, Gibson is very much back in the playing field he seems comfortable with. That said, Gibson seems to have also taken the time away to pull in other influences for his art as many of the early scenes here in which the director develops and builds the character of Doss with actor Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, The Amazing Spider-Man) feel as if they were constructed to be a love letter to Hollywood's golden years. This, of course, deeply contrasts the usually stark and brutal tone that Gibson's films take on, but don't fret as those qualities are sure to come still in Hacksaw Ridge. More, Gibson understands that by painting these early, more serene portraits of where his pacifist of a protagonist comes from he by default makes the bloody and downright horrific war sequences that inevitably take place that much more affecting and that much more powerful. Though somewhat working at odds with one another given how realistically and viscerally Gibson paints his scenes of war with a story that more or less condemns such actions these two elements of what we're seeing and what train of thought we're being encouraged to consider come to work in each other's favors. For as quickly as we see how easily a life can be snuffed out and how faithful Doss has to be to trust that he can \"run into the hell fire of battle without a weapon to protect his self,\" and still survive the point is made that the violence of war is senseless and that, after such an experience, most soldiers would likely agree with such a sentiment. Gibson isn't just making a war film to show off how skilled an action director he is or to revel in the gluttony of violence, but more he is using this profusion of blood and gore to align us more with the mentality that Doss brings to the battlefield and why, despite popular opinion, that might not be such a bad thing. The greatest accomplishment of Hacksaw Ridge though, is that it accomplishes relaying such ideas without preaching them, but instead more by standing with its lead character who stands by his principles even in the great circumstances of a world war.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

My admiration for his movies (at least the ones that he has directed) is in spite of my disdain for him and his political views. He should wear that as a badge of honor, because I am NOT easy to please as a film critic, even if I like you. With that being said, so far Gibson is batting 1000 as a director in my book. All of his major directorial efforts so far (Braveheart, The Passion of Christ and Apocalypto) have been EXCELLENT movies, truly amongst the best ever. Hacksaw Ridge doesn't break his streak...it's DAMN GOOD!  (Stop here to avoid spoilers)\nFirst I will give you my criticisms, both are relatively minor and both apply to his other movies also.\n1. Hacksaw Ridge, like is other movie, is EXTREMELY violent and graphic! To be fair, like he is other efforts, the violence is integral to the subject matter and presented so organically that it doesn't appear gratuitous.  But his continue reliance on violent subject matter runs the danger of being perceived as a artistic crutch. \n2.",

            "content": "It's been a while since we had an excellent war film right? Sure films like Fury, The Hurt Locker & American Sniper played their parts well in adding to the genre, but in comparison to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan, they fall short. Some war films use a particular war from history to tell a fictional story, all three of the above for example, however, a war film for me becomes something else entirely when it tells a true story, especially one as remarkable as the story that this film is based on. War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson's latest war drama it manages to be something more that we can grasp it. No matter what you think about Mel Gibson as a person, after watching this film you will agree that he has made his contribution in the form of one of the greatest war films. This is a remarkable film about a remarkable true story you can't believe actually happened. Based on the true story of US Army medic Desmond T. Doss, a man who refused to bear arms, yet was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for single-handedly saving the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. If you've seen Braveheart  or the Passion of the Christ you know that Gibson is one of the few directors who have mastered the art of film making. If you want further proof than look no further, as this is another fine example of his work. The story follows Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a devout Christian and member of the Seventh-Day Adventist raised by his caring mother Bertha (Rachel Griffiths) and abusive alcohol father Tom (Hugo Weaving) strained by his experience in World War I. With World War II ravaging, Desmond enlists in the army as a Conscious Objector and to serve as a medic. During boot camp training, he faces causes displeasure in his drill sergeant Sgt Howell (Vince Vaughn) and commanding officer Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) when he refuses to touch a gun due to his religious beliefs. But when his platoon is deployed on the battlefield in Okinawa, Japan, Desmond proves to be more worthy as a soldier than many believe when saves over 50 wounded soldiers without even firing a single shot. Gibson returns to the director's chair to helm this true story, giving his touch of humanistic quality, anti-war themes and brutality to the horrors of war to much great detail. The direction is pretty much on point throughout and never goes dull or loses itself during its 131 minutes running time. One of the biggest ironies is how Mel Gibson cohesively makes a case of pacifism through an unflinchingly brutal portrayal of the horrors of war, and the story of how lead character Desmond Doss must face the violent nature of active combat that greatly conflicts with his religious beliefs. The first half of the film introduces Desmond as a young man who embraces his spirituality, while forced to deal with abusive upbringing by his father Tom who feels scarred by his son when he decides along his Howard (Desmond's brother) to enlist in the war, recounting his harrowing experience in World War I that cost the lives of his friends. Along the way, we are then introduced to hot-shot nurse Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) who Desmond quickly forms a relationship and provides some sweet moments of levity and connection for Desmond when he out overseas on the battlefields, though the depiction of their romance is a bit hokey and somewhat awkward during the first half-hour. Ultimately, the first hour is primarily about establishing Desmond's pacifism and the cruel nature in which he endures when he makes himself the center of ridicule by his officers and fellow comrades who view of his refusal of abandoning his firmly held conviction against fighting as an act of cowardly, which is gracefully brought together in the boot camp training sequences in the fashion of 'Full Metal Jacket'. It's only in the second half we get into depicting the Battle of Okinawa at Hacksaw Ridge, the site of one of the bravest human feats in history. Both tell the story of the determined individual that Doss was and Mel Gibson does a wonderful job in directing the film. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes this film a wild and brutal trip down the path to religion and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself is one of Gibson's less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. This is not just simply a war film, but a man's own personal war against the people and powers that be that tried to suppress him and his faith only to be proved wrong. This film is about as good as you can get these days and everything here is done to sheer perfection from the outstanding acting to the war scenes to the makeup, sets and everything done to capture not only the period elements of the time, but also to not only take us to those battle lines, but make us feel as if we were right there and experiencing them for ourselves. This film displays war as atrocious as it truly is. True to his reputation Mel does not hold back with the battle scenes. The devastation is already extensive and the ground strewn with bits of bodies by the time the 77th arrives. The battlefield scenes are the most harrowing I have ever seen. There is nothing left to the imagination with shock after visceral shock coming at you for a good twenty minutes. The effect is an adrenaline surge as you feel like you are trying to survive with Doss and the rest of his troop. The payoff occurs after Doss does what he does and comes off Hacksaw Ridge. It is so emotional. The effect is amazing and it is all steered by Gibson's intense direction. The shattering reality of war is dizzying and full of impact, moving so quickly you can barely identify the characters in a whirlwind of panic, pain and death. But amidst the chaos, Desmond Doss's character is revealed to everyone and even his harshest critics realize how wrong they were about him. Watching the story change from having the battalion hating him so much that they try to have him imprisoned, to refusing to go on the battlefield without him, is so moving and inspiring. Neither war itself nor violence is glorified in the film, yet they also not derided. The elements of conflict that draw the storyteller - the heroism of overcoming adversity, the bonding of soldiers, and the brave resolve on which soldiers must rely to perform their duty amidst such chaos and terror - these elements are all present, but they placed alongside the horror, the madness and the terror of war, and used to draw in the audience for Doss' journey. The lasting psychological impact for those who survive conflict is well told by Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Doss' father, whose lines could serve as a mouthpiece for many veterans. The heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film's merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. The most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film's Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayoneted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. The score by Rupert Gregson-Williams is terrific, varying between nerve-wracking tones during the quiet pauses between battles, and then turning to a beautiful heroic melody for our main character. The whole film is carried by Andrew Garfield's performance and he doesn't disappoint, as he gives the best performance of his career here. He brings us a soft spoken, earnest and strong willed Desmond and the actor gives his all throughout the film, both emotionally and physically. Teresa Palmer has delightful chemistry with Garfield as his love interest and gives the courtship scenes a charming old-fashioned feel. We also get excellent performances from surprising supporting actors, such as Vince Vaughn. The usually comedic actor gives an effective dramatic performance as a drill instructor and infuses his witty humor during the boot camp scenes. Sam Worthington also gives a surprisingly good performance as Doss' cynical superior officer. Both these actors aren't specifically known for their acting prowess, but both do their characters justice in this film. Luke Bracey as Smitty Ryker also plays his part well. The standout supporting actor was Hugo Weaving, as Desmond's father who is a veteran-turned-angry drunk. Weaving gives the man an intense and vicious persona, and with little small tics, makes you believe the man has been through immense pain and loss. Mel Gibson has attracted a lot of bad press over the years but there is no denying that he is a good director, and here, he may just have made his best film yet. It's the emotional power of the story that Gibson taps into so successfully that makes this film one of the best of the year. On the whole, 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a brutally powerful emotional cinematic landmark that works due to its excellent storytelling, terrific acting performances, and marks a highly admirable directorial return for Mel Gibson.

The special thing about Desmond is that he is a pacifist and doesn't ever carry or use a gun. During combat training his superiors want him out of the army, and make his life as miserable as possible. He perseveres and is sent to the front line as an unarmed medic. When the battle goes wrong, he stays behind when all the rest has retreated. It is then that he performs the great feat of rescuing 75 wounded men away from the front line. The story of Hacksaw Ridge is a unique one purely because of Desmond Doss. But the traditional American heroes fighting for our freedom and slow motion, brutal fighting scenes are always present. The emotional, he is our hero, moments are also there, but it fits with this movie. Hacksaw ridge is entertaining and worth watching, but don't expect many innovations to the genre.",

Desmond Doss who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving 75 men in the Battle of Okinawa during WW2 for those who don't know their history. The story is executed perfectly in the roughly 2hr and 15min movie. The first half shows his life and boot camp and the second half the Battle at Hacksaw Ridge. The movie is based on a true story as well which makes it that much more grounded. The acting is tremendously Superb. I mean Andrew Garfield killed it lol. No pun intended. I know some people don't like him but he was great at portraying a convicted individual who's beliefs were being attacked. The other three standouts were Capt. Glover played by Sam Worthington and Sgt. Howell played by Vince Vaughn and finally Tom Doss played by Hugo Weaving. They all were Impeccable in their acting. The action was honestly some of the most Intense I have seen in a Military Movie to date and I have watched a ton of Military films and I have studied military history. The depiction of the battle of Hacksaw Ridge was very authentic and extremely heart palpitating. The Japanese were and are in my opinion the greatest threat that Americans have ever faced in battle. They were extremely formidable and were not afraid to die at any given second. I digress but the battle was bloody and full of shock value but not unrealistic by any sense. The cinematography was honestly perfect in every shot and frame. I will close by saying this is honestly the Best Military movie I have seen to date including in my opinion surpassing \"Saving Private Ryan\" and Mel Gibson as always is a Beast of a director. I was honestly in tears at the end of the movie when they showed the real life interviews of the actual heroes of that real life event. Go and Watch this movie.",

Hacksaw Ridge has some of the greatest war scenes ever put to film and that is not an exaggeration on my part. Andrew Garfield is incredible as real-life war hero Desmond T. Doss and may just get some Oscar attention. The true hero of this film though is the afore-mentioned director Mel Gibson. He does not rush to the battle scenes and make the violence overly gratuitous. Mel takes his time to build the characters and relationships without needing to shove in a needless action scene. All the action and violence in this film serves a purpose, and that is to show the brutalities of war while still leaving room for more character moments, which we sadly do not get to see much anymore in movies. Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best war films in a long time and one of the best films of 2016.   8.7/10",

In fact, it was even more inspirational than I hoped, and even more gory than I feared.  It is likely to make every Christian want to be as faithful as Desmond Doss, and be ashamed not to be. \nI was expecting the movie to be religious and violent-but I wasn't expecting it to remind me of what true patriotism is.  The movie is set during World War II, when the military wasn't crippled by political correctness.  Generals were ordered to fight to win-not fight to tie.  Every American knew who the enemy was, what it would take to defeat that enemy, and wanted to be part of the victory in whatever way possible.\n The battle scene at the end seemed to go on terribly long-longer than I wanted to watch.  But I could not help thinking that the real battle went on much longer, and was much worse than was shown on the screen.   The graphic violence was necessary to make the point.\nI went at 1 PM in the afternoon, which probably explains why everyone in the theater looked to be older than 60.  Once the movie began, all the talking ended and the atmosphere became more reverent than many churches.  When the movie ended, everyone left quietly without saying a word.  Clearly everyone was moved; but I wondered what moved them the most.  Since nobody said a thing, I don't know how they were moved, and what lasting impression it made.  I wonder how a younger audience, largely ignorant of the horrors of World War II, would react to it.\nIt is an important movie that deserves an Academy Award; but, given the director and subject matter, it probably won't even get a nomination.",

            "content": "Mel Gibson needs to direct more movies. End of statement. It's been a decade since Gibson last helmed a movie, 2006's visceral art film for jocks, Apocalypto, and he's been in \"movie jail\" ever since a string of controversial drunken statements. His new movie is a completely earnest, classical example of storytelling that you just as easily could see faces of old appear (say John Wayne in place of curmudgeonly Vince Vaughn), and Hacksaw Ridge is a stirring war movie and a stirring character study. Andrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who wanted to go to war but refused to touch a gun. The first half of the movie is the U.S. Army trying to make sense of this inherent conflict, looking for ways to intimidate him, make him compromise, or kick him out of service. Yet, he endures, and it's in the second half that Doss single-handedly saves 75 wounded men as a medic left alone on a deserted battlefield in the Pacific. Garfield (Amazing Spider-Man) is a solid lead performance, though his cornpone West Virginia accent irritated me... until the real Desmond Doss is showcased in archival footage and he sounds exactly alike. The supporting characters are rich and have more depth than I was expecting, including Hugo Weaving as Doss' father, a drunken shell from his WWI survivor's guilt. There's much more complexity to what otherwise could be a hateful drunk and one-note character foil. The one miss I felt was the courtship between Doss and his future wife (Teresa Palmer). It felt like an outdated perspective where a man's insistence overrode a woman's agency and he was rewarded for it. Admittedly, that's a modern perspective applied to a generational relationship from long ago. The movie is naturally graphic but the bloody violence is stylized in a way that communicates the ugliness and chaos of war. The action develops and is grisly and engaging without losing sense of the characters and without falling into redundancy. When Doss is rescuing survivors in the final act, the movie finds new challenges that he has to overcome to keep things interesting and raise the stakes. Gibson's images can be frightfully beautiful; his command of visual storytelling and its evocative power is too good for only one movie a decade. It may be impossible to make an anti-war movie without in some way glamorizing war, so even though Hacksaw Ridge celebrates the heroism of one man's anti-violence values it finds a mainstream sense of entertainment in the carnage. It's like a tentpole Oscar movie and I hope I don't have to wait until 2026 for the next Gibson-directed vehicle.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

            "content": "First Hit:  A very powerful and graphic film about a conscientious objector's selflessness to save lives in a horrible battle.\n\nThis film is not easy to watch as many of the graphically violent scenes may make you cringe, close your eyes, or turn away from the screen as I did. Although the number of war torn bodies in this film was far greater than what I saw in Vietnam, the point wasn't lost on me: \"war is hell\" as William T. Sherman in 1870 said and Director Mel Gibson wanted us to see. As he did in \"Passion of the Christ\" and \"Apocalypto\", Gibson shows us man's inhumanity to man.\n\nHere he shows us Desmond Doss (Darcy Bryce and Andrew Garfield), whose belief in God, as a Seventh Day Adventist, won't allow him to take another man's life. We also see the lessons he learns from a difficult childhood. His father, Tom (Hugo Weaving), is an alcoholic which began with his own suffering from the loss of his childhood friends in WW I. The beatings his mother Bertha (Rachel Griffiths), brother Hal (Roman Guerriero and Nathaniel Buzolic) and he take, affected him deeply and as an audience member, were difficult to witness.\n\nBecause he has a sense of duty, despite the objections of his mother and father, he signs up to join the WWII effort as a medic Conscientious Objector in the US Army. Prior to his induction he meets Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) whom he charms with his wholesome, caring and kind nature. She sees the depth of his integrity and they agree to marry on his first leave.\n\nWhen his platoon Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) announces to the rest of his platoon that Desmond won't be carrying a gun to protect his peers, they make him a pariah. He's beaten and disowned by his fellow soldiers and they even try to Court Martial him out of the Army.\n\nGibson painstakingly develops the backstory so that when Desmond enters the battle for Hacksaw Ridge the audience is ready for him to become the hero he became. As the first of only three Conscientious Objectors to receive the Medal of Honor, Desmond amazes his fellow soldiers. Alone he saves 75 wounded men by saying to himself and to his God, \"give me the strength to save just one more\".\n\nThe battle itself is one of the most graphic you'll ever witness and it is important to know this going in. For me it triggered huge sadness because of the memory of piling up dead Viet Cong soldiers after an all-night firefight.\n\nAlthough this film is long at 2 hours and 11 minutes, the elongated battle scenes are extremely well orchestrated giving the audience a sequence of stories all tying together.\n\nGarfield was spectacular and amazing in this performance. His embodiment of Doss was deeply heartfelt. I would predict that he may receive an Oscar nomination, along with a real chance to win. I'd definitely give him a vote. Weaving was powerful as the father who was gutted by his involvement in WWI along with how this, and his alcoholism, affected his life. The last scene where he reaches out to help his son was deeply heartfelt. Vaughn was in the best non-comedic role I've ever seen him in. In my view, this role brought a new dimension to his acting abilities. Bryce and Guerrieo were wonderful as the young Doss brothers. Palmer was fantastic as Desmond's one true love. Griffiths was very good as Desmond's suffering and faithful mother. Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan wrote a fantastic screenplay. This screenplay is Oscar worthy and the dialogue is amazing in its range. It contained humor, military order and strictness, romanticism, and spiritual beliefs all wrapped into one film effectively. Gibson, regardless of how you may think of him as a celebrity and person, his direction of this film is truly amazing. Like Spielberg, he knows how to craft scenes of war in a way that can make an audience feel the experience. He deserves to be given consideration for an Oscar as well. If you see this film, make sure you watch the short clips during the credits of the real Desmond and others who knew him.\n\nOverall: Although this film can be hard to watch at times, it clearly makes a strong point about the power of one man living his truth.",

Don't get me wrong, I like a good war movie, but something about the repetitiveness of the action, excessiveness of the gore, and the inaccurate portrayal of the tactics turned me off. Finally, act three felt like a shameless in your face metaphor for religious folks. So much bible pounding at the end just took the focus off what the film was about. I can understand why people would really like that stuff, but for others it just felt like a sales pitch for Christianity. Will never need to watch that movie again.",

            "content": "Grade:  A\n\nRating:  R, 139 minutes\n\nIn a Nutshell: This is NOT your typical Christian movie.  Directed by Mel Gibson, this graphic, true story inspires faith and courage amidst a background of the brutal, horrors of World War II.  \n\nThe audience cheered and clapped several times during the movie to honor the first \"conscientious objector\" to receive the Medal of Honor, Desmond T. Doss.  The theater I sat in was also filled with veterans, based on their reaction and the comments I heard from them while we slowly walked out.\n\nUplifting theme:  \n\"When the world is busy tearing itself apart, it doesn't seem like such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together.\" - Desmond\nHow well do you hold to your convictions?  How well do you show respect to those who do? \nBravery, cowardice, patriotism, friendship.\n\nThings I liked:\nThe star cast really knocked it out of the park on this one.  The acting really was stellar, led by Hugo Weaving, Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, and Dorothy Schutte.  Vince Vaughn was surprisingly effective. Hugo Weaving was absolutely amazing.\nMost people don't much about Seventh Day Adventists. It was inspiring to watch a man truly live his religion.\nIt reminded me a little bit of the faithful story in Saints and Soldiers, but with the gore and drama of Saving Private Ryan\nHow do they film war scenes like this?\nI always love true stories where you get to see video footage and pictures of the real people the story is about at the end of the movie.\nDesmond goes to Fort Jackson.  I didn't realize it was around during WWII.  My oldest son went there for his Army training too.\nMel Gibson was a Hollywood hunk for many decades, only to be laughed at and dismissed in the past few years as a jerk and wackadoodle.  This film may be his comeback and apology.  It'll be interesting to see if anyone is willing to grant him an Oscar.  Gibson is on par with his excellent work in Braveheart and Apocalypto  After a 10 year directing break, welcome back, Mel.\nThere is a huge contrast between the sweet, innocent love story between Desmond and Dorothy during the first half of the movie and the brutal, gory carnage of the second half.   That stark contrast reminds me of the incredibly powerful movie \"Life is Beautiful.\"\nThings I didn't like:\nDoes faith, patriotism, and courage have to be packaged with so much violence and gore to be appreciated?\nNo guns.  No killing.  Where have I heard that before?  Oh yeah....Batman.\nYou feel like your gut has been punched and your heart ripped out by the time you stagger out of the theater.\n\nHere's an interesting trailer with Mel Gibson.  Did he get religion?\n\n\n\nInteresting lines:\n\"The U.S. Army does not make mistakes.\" - \n\"You better come home to me.\" - Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer)\n\"In peace, men bury their sons.  In war, fathers bury their son.\" - Vito Rinnelli (Firass Dirani)\n\"You didn't kill him. \" - Smitty (I loved Luke Bracey in Point Break (2015) \n\"In my heart, I did.\" - Desmond\n\"All I saw was a skinny kid.  I didn't know who you were.\" - Captain Glover (I chuckled to myself, because Sam Worthington's character in Avatar was all about \"I see you.\") \n\nFunny lines:\n\"I have seen corn stalks with better physiques.\" - Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn)\n\"We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy. Keep climbing.\" - drill\n\"You're like gum on a shoe, ain't ya?\" - Sgt. Howell\n\"It's a bit late for target practice, don't ya think?\" - Sgt. Howell \n\"I'm going to marry her. \" - Desmond\n\"Does she know it?\" -  Bertha Doss (Rachel Griffiths)\n\nTips for parents:  \n\n\nThis is NOT a children's movie.  It's rated R for extreme violence, gore, lots of scary dead bodies, and realistic war images.\nYou see the rear end of a naked soldier.\nIt's surprising how little profanity there is, considering the movie is full of tough soldiers in horrible situations.",

If you can get past the 20 mins at the beginning, then you are in for a great film. The first third is boot camp and the last 2/3 of the film is the battle on Okinawa. You root for Private Doss as he struggles through the boot camp and ends up in court with the army general. The thought about going to war without firing a shot can be very heart-taking. The battle on the island is awesome. Lots of CG action with explosions and people blowing up everywhere. It is very violent with blood guts and gore and resembles the beach scene from Saving Private Ryan. The finale is amazing and when you walk out of the theater, you feel bad for all those men that died and amazed on how many Private Doss saved during the battle. Its better than Fury and better than Unbroken. Goes see this great war movie.",

In the end, these two paradoxical things come together pretty well into an interesting and very emotional story. It doesn't quite match the best movies in this deep genre, but it's definitely a worthwhile filmmaking effort from one of the great Directors alive today.\n\nInitially, I was a bit disappointed with Andrew Garfield's performance as Private Desmond Doss, because he seemed too unrealistic in his innocent martyr/saint profile. But once he got onto the battlefield, he came more to life to me. It's almost like things got real for him (and me as a viewer). I was especially taken with his impactful sharing of his near shooting of his father for beating his mother with his enemy-turned-friend foxhole companion Smitty. It explained his internal motivations more, which I was struggling to connect to. Combined with his heroic \"one more\" saving lives sequence, I started to appreciate some authenticity in the Doss character. And that held up until the heavenly ascent of his character off Hacksaw Ridge and into the real life patriotic documentary tribute that Gibson ended the film with.\n\nWhile I feel about mixed about the film overall, there's no denying that the filmmaking on this movie is top notch in every technical department, from the cinematography to the production design to the sound and music. Gibson clearly had a team of incredible professionals and artists behind the camera bringing this story to life. I think with a better script and and a more Braveheart-like (i.e. less approval-seeking or political-correctness skewed) Gibson in the Director's chair, this film might have elevated itself into the upper echelon of WWII movies.\n\nI want to watch this film again in the context of a marathon of what I consider to be the best war movies to see how it compares in a more direct comparative analysis.",

Based on a true story about a man whose religious beliefs prevented him from ever holding or firing a weapon. Despite this, he saved 75 lives without ever firing a shot or killing anyone. Gibson gets the most out of his cast who are all outstanding. Andrew Garfield gives a performance of his career and Vince Vaughn is great as his commanding officer. Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington, Rachel Griffiths, and Luke Bracy also give excellent performances. The movie is a tale of two acts. The first hour is the story of Doss and his family growing up in Virginia. It shows Doss's life and falling in love. The second hour does a 180 and is set entirely in Okinawa. The unflinching and graphic violence Gibson shows juxtapose the humble first hour. I like how the movie shows us there were heroes without making it too heroic. There is nothing fun about war and Gibson is able to make us feel the dread and hopelessness of all of it. Some stories are so unbelievable that it can't be true. Desmond Doss's story is unbelievable because it was true. \n\nGrade: A",

Desmond Doss and his personal beliefs and how they clashed with the realities of combat was s story ready to be told.  Truly he and the supporting cast were terrific (along with Vince Vaughn... Vince Vaughn really?) and the war scenes... once Doss and his fellow soldiers arrive on Hacksaw Ridge it is a brutal thing to watch, Gibson pulls no punches with what war looks like and doesn't shy away to appease the precious sensibilities of anyone.\n\nThe only problems I really have with this is the clunky start of his courting his future wife and relations between him and his father.

For those who don't remember (and for those who have understandably chosen to forget) Mel put himself in the doghouse back in 2006. A notorious and highly publicized DUI, drunken anti-Semitic rants, disturbing misogynistic recordings leaked by an ex-lover and disastrously embarrassing interviews all but destroyed his career. 2016 has seen Mad Mel come roaring back though with \"Blood Father\" being his first starring role in years, and now, his welcome return to the director's chair with \"Hacksaw Ridge\". The undeniably fearless actor-turned-filmmaker who brought us Braveheart and Apocalypto has come back with one of the best WWII films ever made. A heartfelt (and somehow true) story of Private Desmond Doss, a conscientious war objector presented with a Medal of Honor without so much as firing a gun. As a weaponless medic, he managed to save roughly 75 of his fellow soldiers during the battle of Okinawa. On paper, this sounds like an obvious attempt by Gibson to win back the audience he lost with melodramatic over-sentimentality, but it doesn't play that way. The war scenes are as brutal and bloody as they come. Anyone that sat through Braveheart's legendary savagery should easily be able to digest this though. As graphic as the these sequences get, it's tempered by so much humanity and heart that it's nearly impossible to get bogged down by it. The reason this whole thing goes down so well isn't really by Gibson's hand at all (although he certainly shows that his visionary chops have gone nowhere). The reason is Andrew Garfield. He delivers what has now become my favorite performance from a male actor that I've seen all year. His take on Private Doss is a wonder. He is simple, yet charming. Heroic, yet soft. Humane, yet ferocious....I honestly don't know where to even start. Whatever promise he showed as Spider-Man (and 2010's The Social Network, for that matter) was in no way adequate preparation for the gusto he brings here. The Oscar buzz couldn't be more appropriate. He deserves to be nominated and he deserves to win. Regardless, this is certainly a movie-lover's movie and should be seen in the theater for the proper affect. Possibly the best film of 2016.",

            "content": "It has been ten years since Mel Gibson was calling the shots for Mayan saga Apocalypto, but his direction here is so confident and ambitious you wouldn't know it. It's like he never left. This true story is essentially split into three parts: the introductory story to our heroic protagonist, the training segment full of adversity, and the horrific battle between the Yanks and the Japanese atop the eponymous ridge. Each act is better than the last, with the family and romantic drama at the beginning slow and not totally convincing, the boot camp section predictable but highly engaging, and the extended war climax an immersive triumph. It doesn't come as a surprise that Gibbo feels most comfortable with the battle scenes-he is the director of Braveheart after all-and in this respect he is firing on all cylinders, creating a truly intense and visceral experience. The death and decay is gruesome and unsettling-you can almost smell the burning flesh and rotting corpses-but the savagery is necessary to generate the authentic juxtaposition of horror and heroism. Portraying Desmond Doss, the first conscientious objector to win the Medal of Honor, Andrew Garfield is put the through the wringer both physically and emotionally, ultimately giving a solid performance despite working with some cheesy melodrama at the start. The supporting cast are predominantly strong, particularly Hugo Weaving who acts the hell out of his drunken WWI vet and Vince Vaughn who dishes out a delightfully shouty and zinger-filled turn as Doss' drill sergeant. A moving tale of one man's struggle to stay true to his beliefs whilst helping his country in the most harrowing of circumstances, Hacksaw Ridge is proof that Gibson should be behind the camera more often.",

Gibson, himself, describes HACKSAW RIDGE as an anti-war movie, even though it revels - often unnecessarily - in gore and mayhem. There may be something to be said about a \"scare factor\" - the idea that showing graphic violence will be horrifying and off-putting - even though such interest in horror risks satisfying an unhealthy voyeuristic revelry which might work to undermine Gibson's proclaimed cause. Although, to the contrary of the visual content, the explicit language of the characters acts as an antithesis to typical justifications of war at the expense of the values of those protest war. \nTo provide some additional context, HACKSAW RIDGE is based (with seemingly excellent historical detail) on the life of Desmond Doss. Doss, played earnestly by Andrew Garfield, experienced a great deal of violence from his family as he was growing up and, ultimately, decided to turn his life around by swearing off the use of weapons. As an adult, Doss felt obligated to assist in defeating the axis powers during World War II. His family, especially his damaged father (portrayed with great nuance by Hugo Weaving) pressures Desmond to avoid participating in the war. Desmond succeeds at this restraint for a while, especially when he falls in love with a local nurse (played by Teresa Palmer, who is great in the role despite it being terribly underwritten). Eventually, Desmond can take no more and joins the military. The story continues to reveal the challenges that Doss had to overcome in order to maintain his beliefs regarding anti-violence while still participating in the war. \nWe might note that Doss claimed to be a \"conscientious cooperator\" as a variation of \"conscientious objector\"... Doss, himself, desiring to actively contribute to a war effort while maintaining an anti-violent position provided an inherent contradiction that the movie struggled with adapted. I must admit, though, that contradictions are often intriguing - and this particular dialectic may have some productive possibilities bound up in it by being a catalyst for dialogue between those who disagree about the [lack of] value of carnal warfare. \nThe movie feels very compelling, which is no doubt a testament to both the true-life story the movie is based on as well as the excellent production quality of the film. Virtually all of the technical elements are executed with precision and beauty. Additionally, the ensemble cast each showed thoroughly unique physical and vocal characterizations as well as emotional arcs. The whole movie has heart. Gibson's direction is no doubt a factor in the sheer energy and emotional grounding of the movie. I would imagine that most audience members would a difficult time being bored during this film - there are all sorts of interesting concepts to latch on to and they are virtually all presented in entertaining ways. I could go on about the virtues of the production aspects of the picture for some time. \nUltimately, even though the movie may stumble in areas, it is seers with intrigue. And, I might add that I agree with the conclusion of the film, which reflects an attitude so eloquently explicated in the rising action of the movie by the protagonist: With the world set on tearing itself apart, it don't seem like such a bad thing to me to put a little bit of it back together.",

I've read about him and seen a documentary but this movie really made me see a portrait that is probably much closer to what it had to be like. This movie gave me a much bigger appreciation for what he did, and what many other American men have done. Seeing this move has also restored in me the faith we give to God and trust in him can help us do unimaginable things. \n\nI would recommend this movie on many levels.

Gibson's effectiveness as a director is as strong as ever, especially during the brutal battle scenes. I'm usually indifferent when it comes to Andrew Garfield, but he disappeared into this character. The writing really fleshed out who Doss was and why he believed the things he did. He definitely had a strong supporting cast around him, too. Vince Vaughn continues to impress me with his dramatic chops, taking on the role of Doss' Sergeant. The standout supporting character was Doss' father, played by Hugo Weaving. Teresa Palmer continues to have a good year (Lights Out) portraying Doss' love interest. The film score accompanied this film perfectly, heightening the drama appropriately.\n\nI don't really have a negative thing to say about this movie. Maybe it was exaggerated a bit for film's sake, but nothing ridiculous or unbelievable happened. Honestly, after sitting on this and really thinking, I have to put Hacksaw Ridge up there with Glory as one of my favorite war films. If you love inspirational movies like this, Hacksaw Ridge is an absolute must-see!\n\nFinal grade: A+\n\n-Ben",

Hacksaw Ridge is an awesome film. the story is very interesting, showing one person taking a stand for what they believe in while trying to serve their country. the acting is excellent, Andrew Garfield does an awesome job as Desmond Doss, giving him such a genuine and humble demeanor. Vince Vaughn gives a surprising performance, showing a departure from his usual \"wise guy\" type of character and really shines in the film. the war scenes, as to be expected in a Mel Gibson film, are brutal but genuinely done. they don't come across as \"shock value\" but rather a faithful display of the true nature of war. \n\nall in all, Hacksaw Ridge for me is one Gibson's best films to date, right up there with braveheart and we were soldiers. definitely worth a trip to the theater.",

This is a film for adults, the images are graphic with realism that will not be for the faint of heart.\n\nCourage takes many shapes like fire fighters who rush into burning buildings or moms and dads making ultimate sacrifices for their kids. This goes well beyond any war movie I've ever seen. \n\nThroughout the film it showed the paradox Private Desmond Doss felt about being patriotic to his country and his religious conviction to not murder his fellow man. Intertwined is the real life tragedy that war had on his father whose own mental break down from WWI causes the worst type of mind and physical pain no one can imagine. \n\nDoss' ultimate sacrifice is his own conviction, versus the toughness required to kill your fellow man, which as a pacifist he struggled with. \n\nThe love story is genuine with Dorothy Schutte. They had real chemistry, which was refreshing in an age where great acting suffers with poor scripts and action is defined by special effects.\n\nThis is a real life hero who saved 75 men in the most horrific hand to hand combat in WWII. A regular person who changed the most vicious battle in Okinawa into a victory for the US forces in the Pacific. The hand to hand combat scenes kept me glued to my seat. The movie does not allow any shortcuts to greatness. \n\nThis movie made me uncomfortable to watch the gruesome scenes, which is a good thing. It reminded me of the toll war takes on the body, mind and soul. It carefully takes the time to venture into the lives impacted and the courage to face the unthinkable. This freedom allow me to write this humble audience review. I was inspired by this movie. Its easy to be biter, apathetic and question the world. Sometimes you understand a little clearer when you see courage in its greatest form. Courage is around you it is not easy to recognize those humble folks who will sacrifice for many.\n\nGo see this movie it is terrific but please no kids this is as realistic as you will ever see. \n\nWell done on this movie. \n\nHighly recommended.",

The audience knows they're being manipulated but still doesn't care.

A humble and tested truth that, your faith need not be complicated to have an everlasting impact on the world. Almost every other great war film elevates the power of the human spirit, our ability to sacrifice ourselves for others, but this film keeps the motivations of this man's actions in focus.

            "content": "Have you ever been misunderstood? Maybe you just failed to communicate your thoughts effectively. Maybe you said or did something that cast doubt on your true intentions. Or maybe others just ascribed to you negative motives of people they've known in the past - and failed to judge you based on your own actions. We've all been there, but few of us have had to risk as much for our convictions as World War II Army medic Desmond T. Doss. You see, as a Seventh-day Adventist, Doss took the Bible literally. To him, the sixth commandment means God forbids killing anyone - ever - for any reason - even in war. He volunteered to be a medic in the war, but even in basic training, he steadfastly refused to even touch a gun. The law calls someone like Doss a conscientious objector. His fellow soldiers just called him a coward. That is... until they went into battle with him. Desmond's struggle to live out his principles, in spite of what others thought, and through the horrors of war, is the story of \"Hacksaw Ridge\" (R, 2:11).\n\nAs a child, Desmond (Darcy Bryce) developed a strong religious faith - and a strong aversion to violence. He and his brother physically fought each other often. One of those times, Desmond hit his brother with a brick, nearly killing him. Desmond's father, Tom (Hugo Weaving) used to beat his boys, and sometimes got physical with their mother, Bertha (Rachel Griffiths). Tom himself was a shell of a man who never shook memories of the violence he saw as a soldier in World War I, constantly visiting the graves of his friends who died in that war. All of this had a profound effect on Desmond in his formative years.\n\nThe adult Desmond (Golden Globe nominee Andrew Garfield) not only wants to avoid doing what he believes God prohibits, but he wants to do good things to help others. After saving the life of an accident victim by applying a tourniquet - and meeting a pretty local nurse named Dorothy (Teresa Palmer) - he develops a strong desire to study medicine. Even as he courts Dorothy, he feels drawn to do his part in the war - as an Army medic. As he says when defending his belief in non-violence, \"With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it don't seem like such a bad thing to me to put a little bit of it back together.\"\n\nDesmond may avoid violence, but violence sure finds him - and sooner than he expected. His drill instructor, Sgt. Howell (Vince Vaughn), and his company commander, Cpt. Glover (Sam Worthington), greet Desmond's convictions with frustration. His fellow trainees, especially people like Smitty Ryker (Luke Bracey), express their feelings towards him by attacking him in the barracks. When Cpt. Glover's boss, Col. Stelzer (Richard Roxburgh) gives Desmond a direct order to pick up a weapon and he refuses, the young recruit finds himself facing the possibility of an Army court martial - and maybe prison time.\n\nEventually, Cpl. Desmond Doss and his company find themselves arriving on the Japanese island of Okinawa in the closing months of the war. Now less than 400 miles from mainland Japan, the U.S. Army and Marine Corps experienced some of the fiercest fighting of the war - with some of the highest casualty rates. Doss' company is tasked with driving the Japanese soldiers off of Hacksaw Ridge - an area of land 400 feet above the beach. To accomplish their mission, the troops had to climb up a rocky cliff face using only a rope ladder - and then face well-entrenched Japanese forces which had vowed to fight to the death. Doss and his company charge straight toward danger. Not everyone would survive, but those who did, were Doss' responsibility - a mission for which he repeatedly put his life on the line.\n\nI often find reviewers' comments in a movie's advertising to be overblown... but not in this case. \"Hacksaw Ridge\" IS one of the best war films since \"Saving Private Ryan\". The battle scenes in this film are even more graphic and intense than the scenes of D-Day in \"Ryan\", and features the most realistic Pacific Theater action since 2006's \"Flags of Our Fathers\". But like those other two, this film is more a story about the men who fought the war than the battles themselves. This is a bio-pic, so there's plenty of character development. It's a story about principles and courage, so there's plenty of struggle and heroism. And, as I said in my first paragraph, this is a story about misperceptions and, in the end, understanding and mutual respect, which contains lessons for all of us. This is a touching human story and an unflinching look at the horrors of war and the value of different kinds of heroism. \"A\"",

            "content": "Upon viewing the trailer, I was sure that Andrew Garfield could pull off an excellent Forrest Gump impression, and he did! Luckily, this film was so much more than just a weird cash grab for Mel Gibson. As usual for a Gibson film, there is tastefully choreographed ultraviolence mixed with exploitative emotional scripting. In this instance, it works out much better than \"The Passion of the Christ\". If you weren't paying attention, this movie might not seem exploitative at all. In fact, if you are Christian, you will probably think this is the best war film since \"Saving Private Ryan\". There is a protagonist who refuses to concede his faith for the sake of military protocol. He finds the strength within himself to accomplish a nearly impossible task...thanks to God. Then there are unrelenting violent shots of viscera, blood, and flying body parts. Fortunately, this film has much more to offer in terms of depth. As war films usually go, many seek to affirm the means of violence and destruction as somehow justifying the ends by creating heroes out of those conscripted to murder in the name of ideology. However, in this movie, the focus of heroism lies not in those who blindly follow orders and get blown to bits, but the man who demands that his ideology take precedence over an unquestioning, violent movement. In the end, both historically and fictionally, he is vindicated by his will and his actions. Sure, there are plenty of hackneyed war tropes going on here, but philosophically speaking, this is a sound and moral film. And I dare you not to tear up at some of Hugo Weaving's scenes. All in all, I think Zemeckis and Spielberg might be getting their jimmies rustled over the fact that a vocal anti-Semite might possibly out-epic them. But, then again, they didn't try very hard this year either.",

He went through persecution, severe mental and physical attacks and abuse and went into battle without touching a weapon to kill. The military courts upheld his rights in our nation of freedom and laws. Mel Gibson's quality of directing and acting has an impeccable record,  regardless of his personal shortcomings we all share. Yet his films have all been worth watching as do Clint Eastwood's films. With the election being this Tuesday I'm going to see \"Hacksaw Ridge\"\nTomorrow.

(It's as religious AND as violent as PASSION OF THE CHRIST, but I'm sure the people who proudly hated that will find excuses to like this.)  It's an Australian production (that already opened there a month or two ago to excellent reviews) so I'm wondering if that will be a plus or a minus for the film's Oscar chances.  Andrew Garfield is outstanding (even if I personally still think NEVER LET ME GO is his best performance) and among the Australians in the cast, Hugo Weaving as Garfield's father is definitely Best Supporting Actor material.  (Rachel Griffiths is also great as the mother.)  Other than Garfield, the only other non-Australian in the major roles is Vince Vaughan who is slightly miscast but not enough to ruin the film (and his performance grows on you).  A young Australian named Luke Bracey stands out as one of Garfield's fellow soldiers, but all of those characters are really good  - and the love interest,Teresa Palmer, for once doesn't make the story drag.  Once the battle of Okinawa starts, the violence is incredible.  Since it's seen through Garfield's pacifist eyes, I guess the relentless shock of it is justified, but, as I said, people could make the same argument about the gore in this as they did about PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  As the film winds down there's one significant flaw - Garfield's brother goes off to war and then disappears entirely from the plot - but otherwise it's a really fine film.",

His perspective only makes you appreciate the efforts that went into this story and his life even more. While the violence and imagery may be too much for some viewers, Mel Gibson nailed the balance between peace and war. You may have issues with Mel as a person but his talents as a filmmaker are beyond question and if this film doesn't see recognition in award season, it won't be because of the film's quality. The ensemble cast includes terrific performances from Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer, and Andrew Garfield who portrayal of Doss and the courage he displays will bring tears to your eyes.

SEVENTY FIVE MEN, to that same cliffside to lower each one by himself with only a rope tied around each of them, and his own hands to let each of them down, one at a time.\n\nMel Gibson proves once again that he is a powerhouse of a director whom, like it or not, as South Park once joked about while making fun of other more hack-directors, \"knows story structure.\"",

The end result is a darn good movie.\n\nAndrew Garfield plays Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who due to his religious beliefs, refuses to even touch a gun. Yet, he still joins the army and ends up being responsible for saving over 70 men on Okinawa. Garfield's performance is very good. Not is his accent consistent, but his firm commitment to his beliefs shines through. It's not talk or cowardice. It's what he truly believes and his anti-gun stance clashes beautifully with his desire to serve in WWII. Garfield, who was screwed out of an Oscar nod for the Social Network 6 years ago, should get some awards traction for this. He's that good.\n\nMel Gibson, who directed this film,  sure does love his carnage. The first half of the film features little violence as we get to know Doss and what makes him tick, but once the film goes to Okinawa, all hell breaks loose. The battle scenes are violent, visceral, and the pack a punch. If bodies and limbs aren't flying all over the place, they're probably on fire instead. Still, it's worth the wait.\n\nGibson also builds tension in the film very well. There are several scenes where Doss is all alone with a bunch of wounded American soldiers and healthy Japanese ones trying to hunt him down. some of the scenes, such as Doss in the underground tunnels, play out more like a spy movie than a war movie, but it's still scary to watch as Japanese soldiers are literally one left turn away from finding Doss.\n\nIt's definitely worth checking out.",

Andrew Garfield is excellent as the soldier who despite pressure from his compatriots and superiors, refuses to waiver from his beliefs and convictions.  The move is not without its problems however.  Though the movie is based on a true story it seemed a bit formulaic.  First everybody hates Desmond  Doss, then they grow to love him.  His superior officers who dedicated themselves to getting Doss kicked out of the Army eventually regret that decision and are glad he did not give in.  As much as I like Vince Vaughn as an actor, he was terribly miscast as Private Doss' Drill Sargent.  He was not believable at all in that role.  Despite the flaws, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a movie worst seeing.  The late Desmond Doss (Who died just seven months before this movie was released at age 87.) deserves to be remembered and respected for showing the good side of humanity in the midst of one of its worst times.",

            "content": "Mel Gibson returns to the director's chair with this war epic based on the true life story of Private Desmond Doss, who served in the Army as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa during World War ll...he also happened to be a pacifist, someone unwilling to partake in violence due to his religious beliefs, which there is plenty of in the climate of war therefore facing tremense odds not in his favor, more so than the men who carry their weapons into battle. I've been a big fan of Mel Gibson's work despite the lows of his career, and \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is no exception. One of the biggest strengths of Mel Gibson's direction is that he doesn't shy away from depicting violence in his films, and with this film he shouldn't, war is one of if not the ugliest thing to exist in the history of mankind, war SHOULD be gory, it SHOULD feel like you're watching a horror movie. Andrew Garfield is very good as Private Desmond Doss, he perfectly portrayed the good hearted nature of his character, and his accent for the most part wasn't too distracting, the film also stars Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer, Vince Vaughn, and Sam Worthington, they too give very good performances in the movie, but most surprisingly of all we also see \"Point Break\" remake star Luke Bracey EASILY giving the best performance of his young career. \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a roaring return for Mel Gibson in the director's chair, masterfully delivering this brutal yet uplifting tale of one man's battle against the tremendous odds stacked against him and his brothers in arms.",

            "content": "The biggest challenge facing Hacksaw Ridge isn't the subject matter or it's extremely religious content. It's the man behind the camera. If you look at the film's poster, you'll quickly notice that the studio claims it's from \"The acclaimed director of Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ\" They're hoping that you forget the fact the Mel Gibson is behind all three of these movies. He is on the roster of celebrities whose personal life affects how their art is received. If you can put his horrible verbal tirades to the side, Hacksaw Ridge is worth taking in. Andrew Garfield leads the cast as Desmond Doss. He's a peaceful, happy-go-lucky young man despite his surroundings. His father, Tom (Weaving), is a violent alcoholic stemming from his days in combat during World War I. His mother (Griffiths) tries to hold the family together for Desmond and his brother, Harold (Buzolic). Desmond flirts his way into a first date with Army nurse Dorothy Shutte (Palmer). He's extremely rusty but his charm wins her over. Their budding relationship is tested when he decides to enlist to serve in World War II. Harold had already mentioned that he was going to serve his country, and now Desmond's announcement rocks his family.\n\nDesmond is the ultimate optimist and is full of strong will. He's a Seventh Day Adventist, and due to the extreme devotion to his faith, he makes it very clear on his first day at boot camp that he refuses to touch a gun. He plans on being a medic, not someone looking to kill our enemies. It's a baffling concept for his fellow soldiers, but especially for drill Sergeant Howell (Vaughn). He is persecuted for his beliefs to the point where Captain Glover (Worthington) attempts to get him discharged for not following protocol. Desmond ultimately stays on and joins his fellow soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa. He held strong onto his faith and his contributions would go on to win him the Medal of Honor from President Truman.\n\nIf you haven't already guessed by the subject matter, Hacksaw Ridge will be a very divisive film for many reasons. I mentioned Gibson's personal life earlier and many people will no doubt boycott the film as a way of boycotting what he has done in his past. I do find it odd knowing the words and slurs Gibson has thrown around to go ahead and be known for making two extremely religious films. There's a contradiction here that I can't help but take note of for someone of his specific beliefs. The film's core subject is all about Desmond's strong belief system. Faith-based films have been growing in Hollywood lately with the release of movies like Heaven is For Real, God's Not Dead, and Miracle from Heaven. Hacksaw Ridge takes a very different approach, as it isn't focused on a current day miracle or some wonder kid changing the town's view on God. Despite Hacksaw's strong and blatant message, it doesn't feel as gimmicky as some of those others. On the other hand, there will be audience members who will no doubt be turned off by the talk of God and the continual prayer and faith Desmond has to keep him going to save his soldiers in combat.\n\nAs a director, Mel Gibson is back to what he does best as he has not only starred in war films (We Were Soldiers, The Patriot), but he has also gone on to win two Oscars for Braveheart. There is a brutally honest aspect about Gibson that shows he isn't willing to downplay the horrors of what our soldiers went through. Gibson and cinematographer Simon Duggan put the audience in the thick of the action in a way that hasn't happened since Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. If you ever thought Hollywood glamorized or softened the blow of what happens to our soldiers, this will open your eyes to the relentless and all-too real situations at hand. There are repeated moments where they show dismembered limbs, blown off bodies, and bullets ripping through the men at high speeds. There is one scene where a soldier takes a blown off torso and uses it as a shield to gain further ground. The blood usage should be noted for any audience member with a queasy stomach. Many veterans have said that Saving Private Ryan was too hard for them to watch. I assume Hacksaw Ridge will have same effect.\n\nAndrew Garfield (The Amazing Spider-Man) gives another an admirable performance. He's going into the fall movie season with two strong contenders with this film and the new Martin Scorsese film, Silence. He has the noble determination as Desmond the soldier. He also has the charm needed in the first section of the film, as he's just so plucky in his attempt at wooing Teresa Palmer as the nurse. There's wonderful chemistry between them, which was lacking in Palmer's film The Choice that came out earlier this year. Having this part of the story open the film makes it all the more heartbreaking when he abruptly leaves to enlist. Gibson also gets a surprise turn from Vince Vaughn. I did a double take when he pops up as Doss's strict drill sergeant. He is by no means playing it Full Metal Jacket style, but it's a good dramatic role for him while allowing us to laugh at some of his outrageous commentary toward the other soldiers.\n\nThe film is the perfect material for someone like Gibson to make his entry back into Hollywood with the hope that moviegoers can focus in on the story. He pulls no punches in how graphic he allows the film to get, but that's the truth behind World War II. He brings out a different viewpoint on how we think of soldiers. In some war films, soldiers are thought of as killing machines who get a high out of taking down our enemy. Desmond Doss is the opposite. He had great strength, determination, and faith to help his country outside of picking up a rifle. It's an inspirational epic that reminds us of what many of our grandparents went through who served in WWII. Hacksaw Ridge is very much a religious film. If that doesn't bother you, it will no doubt be a powerful and moving piece and great reminder of the films Mel Gibson can make.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? One of the most powerful, yet inspirational, war films since Saving Private Ryan",

            "content": "'Hacksaw Ridge' is a phenomenal War Drama/Biopic packed full with brutal, gritty action, amazing dramatic performances, and is headlined by an incredible return to the directors seat for visionary director Mel Gibson who absolutely kills in with this film. The film highlights the incredible story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) who during WWII was the only US Soldier to fight the war without a firearm and managed to save the lives of 75 men with a huge amount of courage and determination. It's great to see yet another Australian film become so successful and get the worldwide appeal so many others do. \n\nFirstly, Andrew Garfield proves here once again that he is an immensely talented dramatic actor with by far one of if not the greatest performance of his career. The commitment on his part to sell this character to us and have us buy into his very distinct beliefs and motivations was fantastically done on his part. He does a great job to get you on board with his character so when he is dropped in the middle of a warzone the tension is heightened as you care for this character so much. His performance was so powerful that depending on the competition later in the year he could very well be in contention for a Best Actor nomination. The only thing in this film potentially hindering his chances of being recognised is not at all a bad thing. It is just that the almost just as strong performances put in by the supporting cast could steal some of the limelight from Garfield. Vince Vaughn does an exceptional job as Sgt. Howell in a role much more dramatic than we are used to seeing, and he also injects a small amount of humour in there that didn't feel jarring at all. \n\nSam Worthington, Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer, and even Luke Bracey had very strong presences in this film and delivered performances that left no gaps in this film. Hugo Weaving specifically had some riveting scenes as the father Desmond Doss and really does completely steal the scenes he features in as his talents trump those of all other actors in the film. Every line of dialogue was delivered with so much conviction that you completely buy into the authenticity of the story and the interactions on show here. \n\nBut there is no doubting that the real superstar of this film is none other than Mel Gibson who comes back after 10 long years to produce another phenomenal film up there with 'Passion of the Christ' and 'Braveheart'. He has come back bigger than ever proving that he still has what it takes to direct incredible and intense action sequences and also direct amazing character centric, dramatic, and emotional content better than most directors today. The way he films the war sequences here is absolutely stunning, they are intense and chaotic and you are literally holding your breath every second as he does not hold back on the violence and graphic nature making it all seem strikingly authentic. But these sequences would not have been nearly as shocking and effective if he hadn't set up every character as well as he did in the first half or more of the film. He utilises every minute of the film about as effectively as you can and gives every character so much personality and develops them enough to where you care for every single person that goes into battle. \n\nThe only issue i had with this film is the very end, if this film was even 2 minutes longer i think it could have been tied up a little better but other than that this was exceptional. Seriously though, what better way to return to directing than with an Oscar nomination, because if he doesn't get a nominations for his achievements with this film then no-one will. That is of course if the Academy can look past the drama surrounding his past and just focus on the masterful piece of art he has created. And just a note, don't go into this film expecting a start to finish war, as the majority of this film takes a very character centric approach so that when the war scenes do come, they are so intense it feels like they last for 2 hours alone. \n\nSo in the end this is another incredible directing job by Mel Gibson with phenomenal performances all round, and one of the best war dramas of recent years. Definitely one to check out for Mel Gibson, and for Australian Film in general. \n\n9.3/10",

The narrative is safe, both in structure and tone, and the boot camp section that follows has stock genre clich\u00e9s (albeit very entertaining ones) led by Vince Vaughn's drill sergeant and his colorfully creative profanities, nicknames, and insults.\n\nIn short, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is Mel Gibson's softest hour of filmmaking followed up by his hardest.\n\nIndeed, when the explicit combat begins, the familiar conventional build-up-which appeared to lack sophistication-suddenly seems intentional by design. Having lulled us into a palatable, accessible formula, Gibson suddenly thrusts us into the vile gore of war. The leap is jarring, and makes the war scenes even more grotesque and repulsive by contrast.\"",

Hacksaw Ridge (2016) is his first film directed in ten years since Apocalypto (2006). The movie is about an army medic named Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) who is a conscientious objector meaning he doesn't carry a gun and doesn't kill. We follow his early life and some events that lead him to become the man he becomes. Seeing his father Tom (Hugo Weaving) become a drunk and abuse his kids and wife because of WWI scars a young Desmond leading him to follow a much more religious path. Soon enough WWII breaks out and Desmond finds himself joining up much to the behest of his parents and girlfriend Dorothy (Teresa Palmer). Desmond has a hard time explaining to his drill sergeant Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) exactly what a conscientious objector is and how he is still as reliable as any other man. The movie explores his journey through getting approval for his opinions about the war to his heroics in the battle of Okinawa. It's well acted and the cinematography is wonderful. Its a great story about a young man that stuck to his believes even if it meant getting beat by fellow soldiers, put on trial and ultimately almost losing his own life. One small gripe is the first hour does gloss a bit on events leading up to boot camp. Desmond seems to just kind of jump on the whole \"I'm enrolling\" bit and it would have been slightly nicer to develop him right before other than just seeing flashbacks, but the last hour more than enough makes up for it. The film is bloody and violent, but is a fantastic watch that I highly recommend taking a look at this weekend!",

I went into it with some trepidation since I have a sore spot for Mel Gibson's righteous angle in his recent work while he spews anti-semitic drunken stupors in his down-time. But I'd heard the buzz, and the trailer looked promising.\n\nIt delivered in spades and grenades. Despite the fact that I am a) atheist and b) not particularly into war movies, I thought I might have had a tough time relating to the lead character upon which this real story is based. Nope. Andrew Garfield sold his sermon and I bought religion. From his pragmatic but prudent advances toward his love interest played by Teresa Palmer (who also owned it), to his religious defiance to bear arms, Andy kills it figuratively and.... well, that's about the only way he kills it.\n\nBut the real genius here is Mel Gibson who weaves you in and out of a love story peppered with corny comedy and fire and brimstone graphic violence like he's Dave Mustaine in a Megadeath ballet. Yes, this flick is gory to the mad max, but the graphic violence is imperative to put a fine point on the sheer size of this conscientious objector's cojones. At 2 hrs and 19 mins, the film paces out nicely with a heart-felt first half that sets a stark contrast against the second half of the film. Sincere, inspired and at times deeply disturbing, Hacksaw Ridge is one of those films that makes you want to be a better man.",

            "content": "Plain and simple, Hacksaw Ridge punched me right in my soul. This is the story of Desmond Doss, a soldier who wished to serve his country as a combat medic but refused to use a gun for religious reasons. It sounds crazy, as his superior officers and fellow soldiers are more than happy to inform him, but Desmond stands firm in his beliefs. His beliefs as a Seventh-day Adventist essentially throw him at the mercy of his comrades and his Sergeant, who was specifically ordered to give Desmond hell during basic training. But the story isn't just about people mocking Desmond for what he believes in and he just serves them humble pie in the end. This story is about men who are avowed in their hatred for Desmond, and Desmond responds by saving their lives.\n\n\n\tWar is hell and this movie is not afraid of showing that. The movie itself only has two major battle scenes, both of which take place on the titular Hacksaw Ridge. These two battle scenes are some of the most gruesome I've ever seen, even more so than 2014's Fury. Constant shots of soldiers being lit on fire, blown to pieces by mortars and ripped to shreds by turret guns. They aren't quick camera cuts either; you see the soldiers roll around, screaming in agony as their flesh burns. When a mortar lands at the feet of a hapless soldier, you watch his limbs fly in every direction. I've never been truly bothered by gore but some of these scenes are genuinely hard to watch and honestly, the movie is better for that. It reminded me of why I know I'll never make it as a soldier which, in turn, makes me even more grateful for the men and women who are soldiers today. \n\n\n\tI'll be completely honest, Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Doss was a little uncomfortable for me. Don't get me wrong, his acting was very good, way up from his Amazing Spiderman days but the way he would cover his teeth with his lips while talking in that exaggerated southern accent made it challenging to take him seriously. Now this is a nitpick, through and through. Like I said, Garfield's acting was fine and as far as I know, Doss may have really talked like this. When I researched the true story after watching the movie to fact-check, no source I found would touch on that. There's solid acting from all the other cast members as well.\n\n\tHacksaw Ridge is a must-see regardless of your views of religion. The story of a lone man standing by what he believes in despite opposition and impossible odds is a story worth experiencing by everyone. I'm certain that a few people are gonna come out the woodwork claiming that the film is \"too preachy\" instead of, you know, the genuine thoughts going through Doss's head at the time but to those who can be mature about this and enjoy the movie for what it is, you will not be disappointed.",

His father, a WW I vet, is Agent Smith from The Matrix.  However I thought he did a good job as well.  Doss' wife and mother were also good. For me, a promising film just fell apart when Doss enlists. \n\nVince \"If You Can Dodge a Wrench You Can Dodge a Ball\" Vaughn is unbelievably cast as Private Doss' drill sergeant.  There is a stereotypical supporting cast of what I can only assume are off-Broadway, C-list actors as the other soldiers as I didn't recognize anyone (which is fine) but who kind of suck at the whole acting thing.  The dialogue seemed forced and unrealistic. \n\nThe movie quickly devolved into almost cartoon-like violence as Private Doss again and again saves his battle buddies.   No tactics, inaccurate uniforms and weapons, and stilted acting made this more like kids playing Army rather than depicting what those soldiers must have surely faced. \n\nAgain, I know this is a true story and I absolutely don't want to take away from Doss' accomplishments.

            "content": "'Hacksaw Ridge' (sounds like a good horror movie!) is a World War II film that does an admirable job of spending almost half the film in America, before they even ship off to Japan to fight. This gives us plenty of time to meet Desmond Doss (Garfield) and his family and find out how/why he ticks. He decides he can't sit by why others go off to defend America, but he also conscientiously objects to killing another human, so can't use any weapons. Big moral dilemma and the film deals with it well. It also gives us time to care about some of the other characters in the unit, so we know who's who when the fighting starts.\n\nIt's kind of amazing Mel Gibson has only directed five films, considering two of them (Braveheart' and 'Apocalypto') are classics - with this film soon to join them. He could turn into the next Eastwood... He also knows his way around a war film, having been in 'Gallipoli', 'Air America' and 'We Were Soldiers', so it's no surprise 'Hacksaw Ridge' is handled expertly. It's nice to see him populate the film with quality Australian actors (it was filmed in Sydney) - Weaving as Doss' dad, Griffiths as his mum, Worthington as his Captain, Palmer as his girlfriend, Nable as a Lieutenant, Bracey as his nemesis and Roxburgh as the Colonel.\n\nWhen they do arrive at Okinawa, Japan, obviously all hells breaks loose, with some great shots of the artillery explosions, then the chaos of bullets, grenades and blood - certainly no punches pulled when it comes to the body count or the gore shown. The scenes with Doss rescuing dozens of his injured comrades from the battlefield are astounding. Garfield really shines as Doss and it hits home how much of a hero he was - highlighting that there's always room for some good in the harsh world.\n\nOverall: Excellent and unique the war film\n\nGav's Rating: 4 stars.",

The war scenes are some of the best out there. However, the film does have some problems. While the film was some very nice themes about love and courage, the film does get preachy during some moments. Also, the film ends very abruptly. I won't spoil it, but I felt that there was more to tell. Overall, this is a great comeback for Mel Gibson.

            "content": "\"While everybody is taking life I'm going to be saving it\" - the words declared by the medic, Desmond Doss, the hero of \"Hacksaw Ridge\". His story is the authentic one. Doss joined the army in 1942 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. During his service, he refused to carry a weapon and kill enemies, justifying his decision based on religious beliefs. Despite all the objection, he saved the lives of 75 soldiers in the bloody Battle of Okinawa. For his heroic actions, Desmond recieved America's highest military commendation, the Medal of Honor.\n\nDoss's biography is a dream material for a film. There is a place for the military spectacle, romance, family drama and friendship, forged in the fires of rifles and mortars. Mel Gibson, who is comfortable in epic narratives, has much to offer. It is to be hoped that Hollywood forgets his excesses and doesn't omit \"Hacksaw Ridge\" in the upcoming awards season.\n\nGibson's film has an articulate three-act structure. First act depicts our hero's childhood and adolescence spent in Virginia. An essential figure in this chapter is Desmond's father - I Wolrd War veteran who battles the traumatic memories, from the front, with the help of whiskey. The alarming questions is: Is Desmond going to meet the same fate?\n\nSecond act - military training in boot camp - the moment in which Doss confronts his ideals with reality. He has to prove that he's neither a coward nor a madman. That the courage not always goes with using physical strenght. This part of the film is filled with sublime scenes. Actors help the director achieve this effect. Vince Vaughn has a fine performance as a strict sergeant. Hugo Weaving is authentic, in the role of an alcoholic father. Similarly, Terasa Palmer proves well as a love interest of our hero. However, the loudest applause goes to Andrew Garfield. As Desmond, he gets through to the audience.\n\nThe last stage of the film is an ongoing, impressive battle sequence. Since \"Saving Private Ryan\" there hasn't been an equally brutal  military scene. The camera doesn't save the audience from the sight of exploading  bodies, torn off limbs and intestines lying on the ground. The most emotional part of \"Hacksaw Ridge\" starts when the war dust falls and the main character faces the bloody conflagration.\n\nIn this engaging story of heroism, the clash point is religion. Ignore the fact that to honour our objector, Gibson had to organise a festival of death on the screen. It is hard to believe in the massage of peace and charity since the thing that satisfies the director the most is the view of killing soldiers. This way or another: it is a great film.",

It's a story of faith, commitment, and compassion, and it's poignant to a modern generation that has been taught to think only of oneself.

Compassion for others and having faith in God are lessons that endure through all times, in war and in peace.  Loved the movie, and it is perhaps one of the best movies I've ever seen!",

Movies this year have wowed me with their breathtaking cinematography and Hacksaw Ridge might be one of the most beautiful of the bunch. The war itself lasts about 30 minutes and it is spectacular and it leaves you on the edge of your seat, I also love the sense of realism.\nOverall Hacksaw ridge is an amazing movie, with great performances and great action with a lot of emotion.\n\n9/10\n90%\n\"A\"\nShould You See It?

Say it again yall!\n\nHacksaw Ridge is a graphic, heart wrenching and compelling story that follows Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) who grows up in a household where his father served in the war and came back changed. He is more aggressive, more heartless, shows signs of losing his mind and at times shows that he wants to end it all. Desmond sees the pain in his father and what violence does to people and decides like his brother to join the military to fight for  his country but to do it a different way. Desmond however has a particular resolve and wants to enter the military as a medic and not carry any weapons to battle. Once he is placed with his company he finds the army has made the mistake of putting him with a rifle group. Despite completing every task he has been given besides handling a rifle, he goes through all kinds of attempts to make him lose his resolve or to just quit. He finally gets his time in court where it is declared that he has the right to fight in battle without any weapons.\n\nThis was a very powerful movie that will definitely tug at your heart and make you appreciate every man and woman that has served and is serving our country. Andrew Garfield does an immaculate job of portraying Desmond Doss. From the humble expressions, to the zeal and dedication to saving lives on the battlefield, Andrew was spot on. Mel Gibson has done it again by giving us a graphic yet heartwarming story. The production value was unrivaled. It truly displayed the very chaos that is seen on the battlefield and how you don't know when or where you will get shot, blown up, burned, stabbed or wounded in some way. It showed in great detail bodies getting blown in half, headshots, decapitations and just the plain ole blood and gore of war. Teresa Palmer is always a treasure to see and delivers yet again as she plays Desmond's love interest. Hugo showed me something I've never seen from him and that is he can emote very well. He played the drunkard, war scarred father with no problem and was believable every step of the way. Vince Vaughn was just hilarious playing the insulting bigoted drill sergeant. The things he said was just off the wall and placed a good bit of humor and a bit of accuracy of how old school drill sergeants were back then. This movie will leave an impression on you and it is a good one. If you liked Saving Private Ryan then you will definitely love this movie. The score, setting, acting and tone of the movie makes this easily a must see movie for adults.",

Even more so, when Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is true to his faith and vows to never bear arms and kill another, even in combat. He joins the military to serve as a medic and to help and save others during combat. Director Mel Gibson may not be likable to others, but when it comes to cinematic filmmaking, he can make a very strong theme about philosophies and the nasty side of war. His previous work like The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto were both strong movies and can be brutal when it comes to violence. Hacksaw Ridge does not hold back, showing the intensity horrifying perspectives of war. Some may compare the cinematic violent nature to Saving Private Ryan. The battle sequences were gory, intense, and yet emotional to these men that were there. \n\n The film follows Desmond, who lives with his religious mother Bertha and a drunken father Tom (Hugo Weaving) that struggles with post war after losing his friends. Desmond enlists in the army, in order to be a medic and to help save others. One condition that conflicts with him and his squad, he cannot bear arms or kill another. Which causes his Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) and Captain Glover (Sam Worthington) to conflict, as he cannot fight the enemy. His fellow troops have issues that they cannot count on him on defending them from the enemy. Also being court martial for refusing to carry a weapon. As Doss recalls it, that he is trying to piece everything together and he will not refuse what he believes in while he can still help serve his country. Doss is sent with the troops as a medic in Okinawa, during the battle of the Hacksaw Ridge. Where the Japanese troops held their ground, slaughtering the troops. Doss tends to the wounded and saves them by bringing them back down to base.\n\n\n What works great with Mel Gibson's film, is he can manage to make us care for these characters that portrayed in the real event battle. Doss meets some troops that despise him or tried fighting him for being a coward. When the battle lights up, Doss witnesses the horrifying moments of war. When chaos of mortars, turret bunkers, and machine guns firing in all directions. His courage to go out there and back to bring every man back to safety was powerful. Even when he ran into a wounded Japanese soldier, he aided him and left. His one true driving force was his faith, even during the harsh times when men are battling against each other. The film does have a bit of faith theme and a short brief love story with Doss awkwardly falling in love with a nurse Dorothy (Teresa Palmer). His struggle in joining the army through boot training. The final moment of war was powerful and intense. Hacksaw Ridge is a great cinematic war film that does well with showing Doss's courage and the brutal horrifying side of war.",

            "content": "When it comes to directing war films, Mel Gibson has proven himself as the best of the best over the years. From Braveheart to Apocalypto, this man has created tons of entertainment for audiences to enjoy. With his return to the directors chair, he proves once again that he is a master at directing battle sequences with Hacksaw Ridge. This is one of the most raw films I have seen in years. Although it does have a few issues, this is easily one of my favourites of 2016. That is saying a lot, due to the fact that war films have slowly become a thing of the past. For the past couple of years Clint Eastwood has seemed to be the man for the job, but that may all be turning around after this. Here is why Hacksaw Ridge is so impressive.\n\nAlthough it is based on the true story, which does make it more believable, this is a story that I would never had expected to see up on the big screen. Having an all-out war film about a man who refuses to touch a weapon, due to his past, seemed a bit extreme for a feature film. That being said, the way this film is presented from beginning to end is absolutely breathtaking. Beginning as more of a romance between a unlikely man and woman, it quickly devolves into a gritty tale about a man going off to war, while trying to deal with the fact that his father does not want any more of his sons applying. Against all odds and against every belief of the men on his team, he is brought into war as a medic without a single weapon to protect himself. There is so much to love about this story and it is much more compelling that I was expecting it to be.\n\nAndrew Garfield leads the film as Desmond Doss and this casting could not have been done better. From Vince Vaughn, to Luke Bracey, to Hugo Weaving, and even to Teresa Palmer, the talent surrounding this picture is unparalleled. Ever since Garfield sprung onto the scene and made himself known in The Social Network, I knew he was destined for great things. Never did I think he would be directed by Mel Gibson in a war film, but his physique and quirky performance match the character perfectly. Each side character is given just enough development to care when he needs to save them and in the final act of the film, his actions become some of the most powerful all year.\n\nThe most jarring thing that I have to warn viewers about is the fact that this film contains two films in one. For the first half, you focus on the life of Desmond outside of the battlefield, dealing with his personal family life, as well as his love life. It is almost a happy and quirky love story to begin the film, but once he is brought onto the battlefield, my jaw dropped to the floor. Holding nothing back, heads are shown rolling, intestines are seen falling out of bodies, rats are eating the faces of fallen heroes, and machine guns/grenades are tearing men apart. Yes, you come to expect this sort of imagery from a war film, but nobody shoots war sequences like Mel Gibson and it can be a lot to take in at times. If you are expecting a compelling story, followed by extreme war scenes, this is exactly the film you want, but cranked up to eleven. I just feel the need to mention this as some viewers may be turned off.\n\nWhen it comes to seeing true stories on screen, it all comes down to what the filmmakers choose to include or cut out. Most true stories end with text that describes what happens to each character, following the events of the film. While this film does give you that, I felt like this film robbed its audience of some of that material. The final act feels slightly rushed in an otherwise perfect war film, and that really threw me off. I was sucked into this story from beginning to end, but it ends far too quickly to feel the final impact that the film wants you to. The best emotion that the film delivers is in the heat of battle and the banter between soldiers.\n\nHacksaw Ridge may have an abrupt ending, not giving enough closure to a few aspects and its jarring war sequences may be a little too much for some viewers, but it truly is an impressive film as a whole. Sprinkling flashbacks and character arcs throughout its duration, it really makes you feel for each character more than you had in each proceeding scene. I found myself transfixed by its fantastic camerawork, compelling screenplay, and hard-hitting direction. Filled with terrific performances all around, Hacksaw Ridge is definitely one of my favourites of 2016. Highly recommended to those who can accept some pretty gory images. Hacksaw Ridge is fantastic!",

I also think that flash backs and flash forward moments were used very well in this film in that they were not used often and were only utilized to further the story. \n\nThis film got intense and got emotional even at the non bloody Scenes depicting the loyalty and devotion to Desmond's beliefs and men hummed he served for. \n\nThis film did a great job on the interpretation and depictions of a chaotic battlefield seen in the Pacific realm. I don't think that I have ever seen the Pacific battlefield interpreted as intense and graphic seen quiet like this films interpretation. \n\nThis film depict a very Graphic interpretation of the Pacific War that looks somewhere in between the World War I in trench warfare and Vietnam in brutality. \n\nThis film felt like it had three separate parts with the love and family dynamic, the fight for Desmond Doss not to Cary a gun, the Hacksaw Ridge Battle. \n\nI really appreciated that the end of the film showed footage and interviews in the film from the real people. Harry Gregson-Williams did the score for this film. \n\nI think that his score did a good job of making you feel those emotions. I liked how this film developed the characters in this film from the military personnel, the family, the love relationship. \n\nI loved the intro scene in the military unit with the naked officer, Desmond Doss, the guy who got a knife stuck in his boot. I felt like it was random and believable. I thought that Vince Vaughn's acting depiction of Sergeant Howell's was probably the best one I have seen of a military leader in a while on how he would ignore the obvious and go for anybody else but the obvious. \n\nThis is a film where I probably will buy and I felt like it is a great film for family relationships and those who are interested in World War II films. I feel like some of the violence and body parts can be very graphic so if you don't like that then you may not want to see this film. \n\nThis is a film faith. It is a film about standing up for your beliefs and ideology even though others are opposing you. It is about dedication and loyalty. I love how Christianity and beliefs were interpreted and depicted in this film. I also liked how the family was depicted in this film. It was very honest and real. \n\nThis is a film I will probably buy when it comes out and would recommend to others.",

The film recounts how Doss heroically saved many lives despite never killing anyone or even firing a weapon. Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and is something of a comeback for him after a controversial past. Hacksaw Ridge is an excellent war movie that is able to tell a shocking yet inspirational story. Andrew Garfield stars in the lead as Doss and he's absolutely excellent. This is one of if not Garfield's best performances, his character is extremely likeable which is brilliant as he could have come off as very stubborn and annoying in the beginning but he isn't. Teresa Palmer is very charming as the love interest. Vince Vaughn gives a great and surprisingly funny performance. Sam Worthington gives a career best turn and is very likeable. Luke Bracey is also fantastic and makes up for his other wooden acting jobs. Hugo Weaving is amazing here as an unbelievably sad and heartbreaking character, it's some of his best in a long time. Mel Gibson does an excellent directing job as he's able to make Hacksaw Ridge both a brutally harrowing yet uplifting film. One of the things I thought was very commendable on Gibson part is that not all of the Japanese are portrayed as evil and violent unlike other war films. The first hour is very interesting as we see Doss fighting for what he believes in. The scenes in the training camp are brilliant, it's infuriatingly unfair but also has some really good comedy moments. Once we get to the second half the film is extremely graphic and brutal. The war scenes are almost like a horror movie with rotting corpses, severed limbs and ridiculously gory violence. This is not a film for the faint hearted and will have a lot of people wincing due to how gruesome the violence is. The make up and costume design is also fantastic. Just like the excellent Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers the battle scenes aren't just loud spectacle but are horrifying and in no way glorify war. The cinematography is also excellent as the battle sequences are even more harrowing due to the way they are shot. The musical score is also brilliant and adds so much to the film. Technically this film is very good and extremely well put together. However this film is not perfect. The opening 10 minutes are really cheesy, granted most of the film is a bit cheesy but the first 10 minutes were unbelievably cheesy. There is also some really bad green screen in parts of the film which really stick out as the rest of the visual effects are really good. I also wish the film could have been a bit longer as the film ends with a lot of text which is expected but I wish we could have seen it play out. However Hacksaw Ridge is an excellent film, its violent, intense yet uplifting. A truly excellent yet flawed film and a great comeback for Gibson. A-",

I'm not a fan of Gibson personally, but this movie is outstanding. It gives the perspective of someone who believes in his convictions. I totally respect that even if I disagree with his stance. Anyone who stands as firmly by his beliefs as this guy deserves respect in my book. Many war films seem so cynical or sickeningly patriotic, but this one is about the story. Period. The violence and gore are intense and believable, but necessary to tell the story. The religious overtones are poignant and ever present, and are necessary to tell the story. Most of all, Desmond's need to serve and to serve in his own way is profoundly touching. It is the story. In these days of automation and conformity for conformity's sake, to see someone being condemned for his beliefs and then rising above those who discredit and even despise his convictions to become a hero of the hypocrites is powerful. It is okay to be different. It is okay to take a beating for your beliefs: you can take it. You are strong. Don't bully others without having a clear understanding of the situation. It is a wonderful message for all people, not just the religious. Actually, the \"religious\" people of now could learn something from this man. Be different, be proud of your differences, and help others the best you can. If people behaved like Desmond, the world wouldn't have needed WWII.",

Before Doss hits foreign shores, his first battle comes from the army, as they and the men in his unit try to grasp his beliefs ending most often in intimidating and threatening gestures or worse. Doss's religious beliefs do not allow him to carry a weapon of any sort as a Seventh \nDay Adventist. Vince Vaughn is fantastic as Sargent Howell, and Sam Worthington is just as good as Captain Glover from the 77th Infantry Division with whom Doss is assigned. His unit has a cast of great actors, one of which is Luke Bracey who plays the part of, Smity. Debuting in his first film is Milo Gibson who plays, Lucky Ford. \nThe movie is very strong in content depicting combat, with an unflinching front row seat for the horrors of war, as well as heroism. Not since the movie, \"Saving Private Ryan,\" has the cinema brought movie goers this type of realism from the trenches of the battlefield. Mel Gibson directs, \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" his first as a director in ten years, and does a magnificent job in doing so. The entire cast is top notch, led by Garfield as Doss, pulling you into the film and never letting go. \nMickey and I definitely both highly recommend, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" as a must see movie, but be forewarned, it is very graphic during the battle scenes. \nIn theaters November 4\nRated R for intense prolonged realistically graphic scenes depicting war\n2 Hours and 11 minutes \n??????\n#MickeyandMarkattheMovies",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge would look to be the obligatory war movie of 2016's Oscar season, and it didn't look like much beyond that. Therefore, I wasn't necessarily excited to see it. I've actually never seen a movie directed by Mel Gibson--no, not even The Passion of the Christ--so I can't say how this lines up in his directorial filmography, but it's well made with a general focus on drama and a very good performance from Andrew Garfield, which are enough to save the end product from its occasionally contradictory filmmaking in terms of its depiction of violence. Based on a true story, Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) is a 20-something pacifist from Virginia in the 1940s. Feeling obliged to serve his country during World War II, he enlists while clearly refusing to use any sort of weaponry, choosing to act as a medic in the field. Eventually he serves in the Battle of Okinawa in Japan, trying to stay true to his convictions throughout. Taking clear inspiration from the no-holds-barred violence of films like Saving Private Ryan, this movie isn't filled with fighting throughout, but when it is, it doesn't pull any punches. The first thing to mention here are the performances, namely that of Garfield. He's just so damn likable that he makes even a few scenes that are awkwardly written in act one feel organic. This is rather rare for me to say, but I didn't see Andrew Garfield while watching the movie--I saw Desmond T. Doss instead. Supporting players like Sam Worthington an Hugo Weaving are good as well, but I was especially surprised to see Vince Vaughn as a drill sergeant and actually buy it. The second he appeared on screen I thought that he'd distract me the entire time, but he didn't, and I feel as if the consistency of the performances speaks to Gibson's ability to get good work from his cast. There isn't much to say from a technical standpoint given that it's all very competently put together, with a realistic look that doesn't overdo the grimy aesthetic and solid editing that makes the war sequences entirely comprehensible instead of butchering everything with a barrage of quick cuts. There are some striking images on display that have nothing to do with the carnage onscreen, and that's one of Hacksaw Ridge's better qualities: it doesn't leave the audience mostly thinking about the violence on display--mostly. The reason I say mostly is that while this movie does a generally good job at not fetishizing the violence or making it look cool, there are some moments where it falters. This is a pacifist film through-and-through, and although I did appreciate some of the depictions of violence such as how displeasing it is to look at instead of being oddly beautiful like a lot of filmmakers do--which is perfectly warranted sometimes--it sometimes loses its way. There are some scenes with the beat progression and tension that would be seen in a horror film but without the fun, and those bits are interesting and effective. However, there are some points where the movie resorts to slow motion and makes the violence seem cooler than was intended. There's also a small stretch of time where the violence becomes numbing instead of staying consistently horrific, and it didn't feel like an intentional choice given how rapid-fire (no pun intended) the film's content is and the short amount of time that the battles take place in. Overall, Hacksaw Ridge is visceral and does what it sets out to do for the most part. Garfield is great here and Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan's script does a good job at fleshing him out as a man. Gibson puts together a competent film, but his voice as a filmmaker seems at odds with what's onscreen sometimes. It's not like I was expecting Paths of Glory, but despite Gibson's strengths as a filmmaker, he still has some weaknesses. Regardless, it's fittingly horrific, being simultaneously sad and exciting to watch, with a satisfying ending. 7.2/10, solid, B-, one thumb up, above average, etc.",

I haven't been emotionally invested in a movie like this in quite a long time. I will be sorely disappointed if this does not get nominated for best picture. Despite your personal feelings about Mel Gibson, you can't argue the fact that he still knows how to make a movie and a damn good one at that. He knows how to film a shot and really knows how to make it effective. The war scenes in this film are some of the best i've ever seen and it instantly reminded me of the war scenes in Saving Private Ryan. They're urgent, cruel, and upsetting, but just like war. The violence is shocking and unrelenting and some of the most vicious and disturbing since, well, Saving Private Ryan. It's mercilessly bloody and urgently violent. You want to look away, but you can't. The cinematography is a thing of pure beauty, it's a marvel to look at. It's visually stunning and incredibly aesthetically pleasing. Andrew Garfield is a revelation and I fully expect him to be nominated for Best Lead Actor if everything is right in the world. He brings charm, humility, and patience to the hero that is Desmond Doss. Not only does he embody the role, he pays acceptable respect to the real life hero. Hugo Weaving is fantastic as Desmond's father and Teresa Palmer is fantastic as his wife. Vince Vaughn really surprised me as well. He's very funny at times, but also commands the screen when prompted too. I won't say what part of the film i'm about to talk about exactly, (you'll know exactly what it is when you see it), but there's a long sequence of Doss becoming the hero that he is, that sequence will stay with me for a long time. It's powerful, beautiful and incredibly moving, just like the entire movie before and after that. Sure we all have heard that \"War is hell\", but Hacksaw Ridge expertly shows us that it is. It may not be very subtle and it takes a little to get going, but Hacksaw Ridge is one of the best films i've seen all year and it's an incredibly harrowing and moving portrait of an American hero that combines real patriotism, faith and raw brutal war violence. It's a spectacle to behold and one that should not be missed.",

Hacksaw Ridge is the biggest surprises of 2016, and forget all of the other times you've heard me say that because this time I mean it, this truly was a surprise. Hacksaw Ridge tells the untold true story of Desmond Doss who saved 75 men in the bloodiest battle of WW2 without firing or holding a weapon. Andrew Garfield gives so far his best performance playing Desmond Doss, which is great because I didn't think he was going to go any where after the Spiderman films. However though his performance was good the best performances in this film were Sam Worthington and believe it or not Vince Vaughn the two of them definitely stole the show here, which honestly for Vaughn is great due to the fact that True Detective season 2 was disappointing. And Teresa Palmer was also great in this film as well though she's really only in for the first half of the film, and ignore what I said in my Lights Out (2016) review when I said that was her best film because thats wrong this film is her best film. I hesitantly give credit to Mel Gibson as well because honestly I really liked the way he directed this film because the style is gritty yet uplifting and I loved the intensity of the film there are moments were you literally feel like your at this battle....not bad Gibson... not bad. Now what I liked most about this film was that it showed that you don't need to kill to be considered a hero. There was only one problem I had with this film and I really don't want to spoil it for those that didn't see it so I am not going to but even that one minor problem I had with it doesn't stop the fact that its a perfect film. With films like Hacksaw Ridge and Hidden Figures all I can say is 2016 has been a year of movies about important people in history who we don't know which is great. Hacksaw Ridge is a raw, gritty, and violent film that still manages to be uplifting if your a fan of war films especially ones like Saving Private Ryan (1998), and Flags of Our Fathers (2006) than go watch this movie you won't be disappointed, and if Gibson makes more films like this maybe one day I'll become a fan of him.",

My only issue is that the film feels like it cuts down its final scene into montage shots to make the 2.5 hour mark when it could've gone for 2 hr 45 mins and could've made an event that happens at the end very much more hard hitting than it turned out to be.

It is a highly inspirational movie that also tells a story of someone worth knowing about. I was invested from beginning to the end in this one. The movie handles the exposition really well and really makes you understand where the character is coming from. The performances are all very good and Andrew Garfield does an excellent job portraying Desmond Doss. It's a realistic movie which is also very commendable. What makes this movie stand out is that it is ultimately about standing up for what you believe in and also not making assumptions about others based on their beliefs, and that truly is a message that everyone should connect with.",

A war story, a World War 2 story, a story based on someone's real life?! My favorite type of story! So of course found this very interesting. I thought the story moved along at a perfect pace. I didn't feel it slow down at all, just got better & better. I loved Braveheart & when I heard Mel Gibson was directing another war movie, I got excited. He did not disappoint. The direction was beautiful. The cinematography was beautiful. Just found this movie artistically appealing. Had some breathtaking, amazing shots. Now I'm not saying it's a perfect movie, there was one scene where the CGI wasn't that great but the rest of the movie made up for it. I personally didn't like Vince Vaughan being cast in his role but everyone else was so amazing he didn't seem so bad. But that was all the \"negative\" I felt about it. The acting really was amazing! Everyone did a great job. This is now my favorite role of Andrew Garfield. The music was also perfect. Loved the way it ended. Saving Private Ryan is my all time favorite war movie, nothing will top that, but this got pretty high up there for War movies. This was a great War movie, very touching & had me crying throughout. Has stayed with me. Hope this gets some Oscar love. A must own for me & stand out of the year.",

Doss's story is an amazing one without the phony buildup or the over-the-top battle scenes. For example Doss's wife did not become a nurse until after the war, in order to support them both, due to Doss being 90% disabled from his battle wounds. Doss was harassed in basic training but he was never beat up. And his father never threatened his mother with a gun. His father and uncle had a drunkin' fight and threatened each other, prompting his mother to ask Doss to hide his dad's gun. And while the Battle of Okinawa was undeniably brutal, it was not Doss's first experience in combat, the fighting, though horrendous, did not rise to the level of Gibson's massive ballet-of-blood, and the cliff ridge was not that high, I've been there and seen it.\nThe profound story of a simple, religious man's life, which could have been so much more in the hands of a different, more mature director, was made almost cartoonish in Gibson's.",

El hecho de que esta sea una historia real la hace a\u00fan m\u00e1s fascinante, y de hecho tuvieron que cortar algunas escenas que sucedieron, pero que fueron tan impresionantes que el p\u00fablico hubiese pensado que fueron inventadas.\n\nEn su n\u00facleo, esta es una historia de amor. Los 2 primeros actos presentan a Desmond, su situaci\u00f3n familiar y su relaci\u00f3n con Dorothy, y cambia de tono completamente cuando es reclutado para la guerra. Las escenas de amor rozan en lo cursi, pero luego cuando empieza la guerra... la pel\u00edcula cambia su tono completamente. Las escenas de combate logran capturar el horror de la violencia, y han sido definitivamente el mejor retrato que he visto en mucho tiempo. Especialmente cuando est\u00e1n subiendo las cuerdas para enfrentarse a los japoneses, y el suspenso de no saber que se encontraran arriba, y luego cuando est\u00e1n ah\u00ed, ese silencio escalofriante.. la genialidad de esas escenas es testamento de la gran direcci\u00f3n de Mel Gibson. Nadie filma escenas de esa magnitud como Gibson.\n\nOtro aspecto notable de esta pel\u00edcula es el respeto con el cual tratan a las creencias religiosas de Desmond, pero sin idealizarlas. Uno como espectador llega a respetar sus creencias, y en ning\u00fan momento sientes que te est\u00e1 dando una lecci\u00f3n de moralidad.\n\nLas actuaciones son lo que elevan a esta pel\u00edcula. Andrew Garfield como Desmond es el casting perfecto, porque este actor adem\u00e1s de ser talentoso, le da a sus personajes un toque de ingenuidad, algo que es valioso en este papel, porque uno como p\u00fablico tiene que dudar de \u00e9l, y luego nos sorprende con su coraje de defender sus creencias sin importar las consecuencias. Pero una de las actuaciones que m\u00e1s me impacto fue la de Hugo Weaving como el padre de Desmond. Es un retrato crudo de las consecuencias que tiene la guerra en los combatientes que logran regresas a sus hogares, y como las pesadillas y los demonios se quedan mucho tiempo despu\u00e9s y termina separando familias.\n\nDe las mejores pel\u00edculas del 2016.",

Unlike other films of the genre, like Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" and Scott's \"Black Hawk Down\", realism and actuality don't appear to be the goal, as seen in theatrical moments like action film-esque heroics in battle and perfectly crafted moments of melodramatic romance between young Doss and Ms. Dorothy Schutte.\n\nIt's a morality tale that tells a moral story in a moral way. A breath of fresh air that holds to true classic Hollywood form in a way that hasn't been seen in a long time. Not perfect, but certainly welcome.",

            "content": "Hacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson, and it stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, and Vince Vaughn in a war film about a pacifist that wants to participate in World War II as a medic, but he doesn't want to kill a person, not even touch a gun, which irritates a lot of the commanding officers and orders Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) to use it, and he doesn't want to. It's really nice to see Mel Gibson to go back in the director chair as he haven't done it in 10 years for Apocalypto. As for his long hiatus, this is a definite return from him that this might be a way for him to come back. I wasn't expecting Andrew Garfield to have that kind of accent, but I start to grow on it in the first few minutes, and he was terrific in it. He's not the only one that did a great job as Sam Worthington also did great in it, Luke Bracey was really good also which I haven't heard about him before except this and the remake of Point Break, and to my surprise, Vince Vaughn doing a drama performance as a commanding officer, and he sells it in this, while also being likable, which is a refreshing change from the typical comedy films that he's in. For the first half, I like how it doesn't even feel like a Mel Gibson film, at least the films that he's well known for, as it was about the backstory of Desmond Doss and the romantic story with Teresa Palmer's character, which I thought was really sweet and adorable to watch with some funny moments between them. Once you find out about his backstory, it makes a lot of sense about why he doesn't want to touch a gun, and it makes it frustrating to watch, but in a good way, that he really wants to be in the Army, but the Army is making it really hard for him to fit in. The second half of the film is definitely a Mel Gibson film as the war battle sequences are intense and a bit horrifying to watch as it's very gory, which makes this probably one of the most realistic war scenes since Saving Private Ryan. I also really like that Desmond still doesn't try to kill a person, even if they're friends keep dying right in front of him, but it does make him wonder about his faith, which I think is really interesting and is the closest to a religion film that doesn't act like a Pure Flix film, and it doesn't say that you should share this belief also. Hacksaw Ridge is an amazing film that if this is what it'll take for Mel Gibson to come back, I'm honestly ok with that.",

            "content": "\"Mel Gibson shows his responsibility as an artist here again with this solid tribute to faith, valor, bravery and sacrifice\"\nMovie Review: Hacksaw Ridge\nDate Viewed: November 12 2016\nDirected By Mel Gibson (The Passion of the Christ, Braveheart, Apocalypto and The Man Without a Face)\nWritten By Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan\nStarring: Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Hugo Weaving, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Rachel Griffiths, Richard Roxbury, Luke Pegler, Richard Pyros, Ben Mingay and Firass Dirani.\n\nMel Gibson's \"Hacksaw Ridge\" tells the story of Desmond T. Doss, an army-medic who saved 75 lives in Okinawa during World War II. This story is preachy and corny at times but it is a harrowing and intense war movie with incredible battle sequences and a terrific performance from Andrew Garfield. Since he was no longer \"The Amazing Spider-Man\", Garfield was free to do whatever project he wished and \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a perfect start to his road in being a mainstream actor. \"Hacksaw Ridge\" also marks a return to form for Gibson after his many controversies and scandals. This movie is in vein with other bloody and graphic war movies like \"Fury\", \"Platoon\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" so don't take your kids who are under the age of 14 because this movie will be way too intense for younger viewers.\n\nIt maybe intense and disturbing but this is what Gibson is known for, he made \"Apocalypto\", he directed and starred in his Oscar-winning film \"Braveheart\" and he made \"The Passion of the Christ\", which became the biggest religious movie of all time. Gibson shows his responsibility as an artist here again with this solid tribute to faith, valor, bravery and sacrifice.\n\nDesmond T. Doss (Garfield) grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia during the Great Depression where underwent a faithful transition after an incident involving his religious mother (Rachel Griffiths) and troubled war veteran father (Hugo Weaving). Desmond almost killed his father with his own gun but he didn't fire the pistol. After that near-tragic night, he vowed to stick to his religious beliefs and to never fire a weapon as long as he lived.\n\nAfter delivering an injured man to the hospital, Desmond gets immediately attracted to a nurse named Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer). After dating and falling in love, Desmond and Dorothy get married and he begins to enlist in the Army. Desmond and his brother, Hal (Nathaniel Buzolic) are about to head off to the battlefield but their father is upset because he expects to lose them just as he lost most of childhood buddies.\n\nDue to his beliefs as a conscientious objector, Doss just wants to serve as an army-medic and nothing else. When Doss arrives to his training base in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, he is placed under the strict command of Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) who doesn't take mischief pretty well. Doss immediately becomes an outcast and gets hard labor and beaten by his fellow soldiers due to his belief of not firing a weapon. Things don't get much better as he gets arrested for insubordination. Dorothy convinces him to take the guilty plea so he could be released but Desmond will always stay true to what he believes in so he will try to defy the military court and hope to serve in the army without carrying a weapon.\n\nOf course, Desmond wins his legal battle and he is allowed to join the battlefield without carrying a weapon. When Desmond and his army unit get to Okinawa, the action in \"Hacksaw Ridge\" really kicks into dramatic gear. We see blood, limbs and body parts splattered all over the battlefield but this is the reality of war. It is not all sunshine and playfulness, war is brutal, intense and truly frightening. Director Mel Gibson captures the reality so well and Andrew Garfield does a remarkable job as Desmond T. Doss. While all the surviving soldiers were safely evacuated, Doss stayed behind so he could save as many lives as he can. He saved 75 brave men that day and he was the first objector to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nWith fine acting and a perfect balance of gruelling terror and inspiring faith, \"Hacksaw Ridge\" is a violent war movie that lives up to it's patriotic and religious convictions and I think Gibson and Garfield names will be listed when the Oscar nominations begin rolling out next January.",

It is indeed deserving for recognition particularly for Garfield its lead for convincingly and compassionately playing the titular character, and I wouldn't be surprised if the film itself will be nominated for several technical ones as well and heaven forbid picture after Gibson's own long absence from projects of this scale due to aforementioned issues. Only true faults if anything was the casting of Vince Vaughan who many will find out of place in such a film due to his persona from comedies and attempts initially to go Full Metal Jacket in the opening moments of training which was an unfortunate call showing his weaknesses in drama at least at the moment, and the slight feel that it may have been a film better suited to the late 90's early aughts, but that is only probably due to the long gestation period for someone to pick this project up to direct from development hell and the abundance of WW2 films at that time. Otherwise will it actually beat frontrunners Moonlight or La La Land for the top prize? Doubtful, but I am intrigued how many noms it will receive and what it will mean for Gibson's return to the fold and which projects he will take on next. Solid.",

Andrew Garfield and Hugo Weaving are the obvious standouts, both playing their polar opposite roles to absolute perfection. Initially I was not entirely convinced by Andrew Garfield's Best Actor nomination, but by the second and third act of the film I was totally on board. Garfield nails the role of the rare conscientious objector without the typical holier-than-thou attitude.\n\nThe film starts as a satisfyingly slow burning, almost drama-like story about morals and the lengths some will go to stay true to them, but ends with the most thrilling and intense World War battle scenes I have ever seen. That's right, even better than Saving Private Ryan.\n\nI would give Hacksaw Ridge the rare 10/10. Damn it's good.",

Was nice how it focused on untold stories like Christianity and the war and how the beliefs conflicted, as well as a medic instead of a rifleman.  It's not all behinds the gunsight, but there's still a fair amount of it.  The beginning was good, slow, gives a good background and the struggles of being caught between a war and what you believe, which is well portrayed, and the fact that it doesn't shy away from showing how people can treat each other of that stuff is also good.  The boot camp is interesting, it seems kinda stereotypical and I didn't like Vince Vaughn as the choice for Sgt, as a well known comedy actor he just didn't really fit the role the greatest, he did ok, but just seeing him there was weird.  Otherwise boot camp was good, the love story was cheesy but good as well.  The action was actually quite impressive. I though it would be kinda crappy, and the explosions were often more fake than I would like, and it had the CGI look of blood when people were shot same as Fury which is disappointing but ok when it's as intense and crazy as the action was.  Right off the bat going over the top of the cliff the action was seemingly non-stop for the duration of the film.  There were bodies everywhere, explosions and gunshots filling the screen, I was actually quite impressed at the level of intensity in the action. It was jammed packed full of it, there was no lacking to the amount of actors getting killed, and the scale of the battle seemed massive as well. It was just well done, shot well, cinematography was good and everything looked like chaos, it was impressive and stunning, and held your eyes to the screen.  Some parts with Pvt.  Doss seemed a bit u realistic but it seems to be a true story to some extent so must have some truth, or so I tell myself.  Also during all the action Doss isn't the centre of the screen the whole time, just the battle in general takes centre stage, and everyone throughout the story gets thrown into it all the time. Has a good ending, as well.  Overall it's a good enjoyable movie, has something for everyone, it's something new to us who love war movies, shows new stories and has good intense action, so would watch again for sure",

Andrew Garfield is totally committed and will be nominated for an Oscar, along with many other nominations for the film. This is powerful, emotional, heartbreaking and extremely violent.

But when the war action starts, the film suddenly quickens its pace, tension, and horror. It is quite sustained and 'in-your-face'. Some scenes were perhaps a little too overly dramatic. For most of the film I found myself not really connecting with the characters, but by the end I had done so to some extent. . D & the MC. \nAAN. GGND AACTAW AFI",

Mel Gibson does a fantastic job bringing this story to life. His direction is top notch, making the first hour of Desmond back home in Virginia not feeling like some melodrama. The real star here though is Andrew Garfield who brings Desmond Doss to life. He brings to much heart, defiance and empathy to this real life Hero.
