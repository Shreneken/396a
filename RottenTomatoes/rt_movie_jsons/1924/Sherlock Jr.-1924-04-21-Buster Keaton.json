Buster Keaton once again puts on a wonderful performance as he was able to utilize his iconic physicality and dry humor to create a hilarious surreal cinematic film. The film's visuals were nothing short of fantastic. Even the stunts that Keaton pulled off were wonderful. The film's writing was also pretty top notch as the film about someone who wants to be a detective has an ironic twist. Overall, Sherlock, Jr. is an impressive and humorous film with surrealism and impressive stunts that make me very fond of Buster Keaton and his work.",

His films are some of the greatest comedies of all time and the more I see the more I agree that his films truly are a one of a kind experience. Filled with humor, drama, and Keaton's insane physically dangerous stunts, you have a formula for pure classic comedy genius! Sherlock Jr. employees amazing effects and truly is the creation of someone who understands and can manipulate cinema for his own visions! The film is a must see by any and everyone! It's also a great starting place for silent film newbies to start. Highly Recommended!",

It's a simple & sweet story with a likeable cast. If you've never seen a silent movie before in your life, this is a fantastic introduction to that genre.",

The movie isn't very long, so the story is fairly simple for today's standards, but it still feels very unique for its time.

This masterpiece has a certain knack for creating a long lasting impression on you with its humbleness and gullible nature which from the first frame you start to adore. This is not you usual good over evil triumph natured script. It is another Monday on this sketchy comic world. The first sequence itself is so tightly packed and flows fluently with mature narration that you are hooked within this first few minutes and you have achieved a thorough insight on these three dimensional characters. Naturally it's a sort of writing that depends completely upon the physical sequences.\n\nAnd the first one consisting the protagonist gathering up money for his love interest shows you the humble and kind nature of it. And after you have hold on to his ideologies the bizarre shadow walking and leaping from a building to another one just feels natural due to his fluent body language. The chase scene with him riding a bike blindly, crossing forests and rivers is pure genius, something that cannot ever be recreated like such. But among all these gags the best is Keaton trying to play the pool, it is flat out hilarious from the way it is weaved out and is executed, each notion of that trick is magic.\n\nTo get a much free and wider range to flaunt his ludicrous theories, the concept he adapted is fascinating and creative. As a performer too, he is jaggedly on mark on foliating the emotions and the perfect example is the last act where you sink deeply in its mellow and sweet love track. Sherlock Jr. is one of those rare silent films that shocked the viewers then as much as it does now, it is an overwhelming experience to watch these characters come alive on screen.",

I do find a lot of that stuff funny, even though if I compare, Chaplin might have a slightly better handle on it. There were a number of times in Sherlock Jr. that I was laughing out loud because he nailed the comedic timing and knows how to setup and payoff a joke. What I dont often see Keaton getting praise for is his skill and inventiveness in movie-making. Some of the tricks I see in this film feel light-years ahead of the other movies being made at the same time. I am constantly stunned at the effects that he pulls off, to the point that I almost want to watch a documentary about the making of the movie as much as I want to rewatch the movie itself.\n\nSherlock Jr. is practically a short film. At 45 minutes, it pushes the boundaries of what most would qualify as a feature film. Because of this it doesnt have an in-depth story that its trying to tell, its actually pretty simple. I was a little disappointed that it wasnt all that much about a mystery, like I expected with the title, but it was still a fun plot. The way they used the dream sequence to tell a story within a story was nice, and it gave Buster Keaton the freedom to play 2 characters. I thought the real genius scene of the film, despite all the intricate camera tricks and fancy stunts that came before, was that simple conclusion. Keaton gets a few minutes alone with the girls and he performs so masterfully you cant help but be charmed. I enjoyed Sherlock Jr., and will be glad to watch it again any time.",

            "content": "I can barely run for ten minutes straight without breaking into a miserable sweat, but Buster Keaton could run for ten hours straight and still be dry as an autumn leaf.  So long as our amusement remains high enough to light his comedic fires, anything is possible.  As one of comedy's utmost pioneering figures, an aficionado of physical dares and frenetic sight gags, there's an agelessness, and an undying vitality, to be found in Keaton's finest works.  Though his heyday was at its most powerful long before John Wayne even made his film debut and long before Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ever took their first steps together, his best efforts don't feel as though they're nearly a century old.  Innovative and spryly funny, they're cultural relics that also play as if they were made yesterday.\n\tSuch is the case with 1924's faultless \"Sherlock Jr.,\" among Keaton's greatest headliners and among the funniest silent comedies ever produced.  Only forty-five minutes in length, not a single moment is wasted; it's a bombshell of Keaton's special inflictions of deadpan expression and adrenaline laced (and gaspingly humorous) stunt work.  Though not an unparalleled success upon release - audiences were too smitten with the regal beauty of Rudolf Valentino and Pola Negri to flock to Keaton's astounding product obsessively - \"Sherlock Jr.'s\" rep has, understandably, only amassed in its respectability with the sands of time.\n\tIn the picture, Keaton, who also directs, stars as an unnamed theater projectionist clamoring to win the heart of a brunette society girl (Kathryn McGuire) with a sweet disposition.  Having little to his name, The Projectionist has, regardless of his background, mostly been successful in courtship, using his everyman charm to make up for the visible class differences between him and his lady.\n\tBut problems arise when a handsome scoundrel (Ward Crane) threatens to steal The Girl away from our hero.  A snaky bastard he is: he's not in the love with our leading lady - just her status - and is a scheming low-life with a weakness for pawning.  Early in the movie does he steal The Girl's father's (Joe Keaton) pocket watch and pin the blame on The Projectionist.  \n\tThe rest of \"Sherlock Jr.\" finds Keaton's character doing everything he can to clear his name and unmask his rival for what he truly is.  But the film hardly seems to be remembered for its inconsequential, \"real-world\" romance; what it's remembered for, after some ninety-two years of notoriety, is its dream sequence, which takes up most of \"Sherlock Jr.'s\" length.  In it, Keaton is sucked into the world of the movie he's projecting, which is a mystery not unlike the one he's experiencing currently.  But he's propelled from passivity to leading man status, given the confidence of the Detective Holmes he's emulating.  That's when the movie goes from cutesy rom-com to daring comedy - the action involves a gag featuring an exploding billiards ball and an insane (especially for its time) motorcycle chase - and, in the process, we metamorphose into a speechless audience instead of an acquiescent one.\n\tAnd there's an elatedness that comes along with being thrilled by a comedy, and \"Sherlock Jr.\" holds up.  Part of me wants it to be longer than forty-five minutes, considering just how much of a lovable pleaser it is, but it also seems about right for a picture that moves faster than the speed of light.  To stretch its running time would diminish the tightly wound perfection of Keaton's style.  He suffered as a result of its magnificence - he served as stunt double for every single one of his actors and was afflicted with the aftereffects of his injuries for years - but \"Sherlock Jr.,\" so awe-inspiring, is art worth suffering for.",

            "content": "You might not expect the world greatest detective in the middle of a Buster Keaton silent movie but here he is, although he is apparently Sherlock Jr. This is one short silent film that is just shy of 50 minutes but its all perfection and such a masterpiece. This movie is just more than fantastic it is just flawless with its humour, its direction but also its use of technical cheats to make it look as if Keaton is for example jumping into the cinema screen or the camera work of a rather famous motorcycle scene and it's great to see in a movie made in the 1920's. The reason I think I and I think others can and have connected to this is because it is so simple yet so lovely, it is like a piece of art plastered onto the screen and made to move, a joy to watch and look at and is probably one the smartest ever silent movies.\n\nBuster Keaton stars in the movie as the film projectionist at the local cinema and he wants to be a detective, he even carries a little book around with how to take care of the situation should a crime arise. He is also in love with a girl called well, The Girl who is played by Kathryn McGuire and she also has interest from the local Sheik (Ward Crane) who isn't exactly a nice man in this story. Things really become even more crazy yet wonderful when the projectionist dozes off during a viewing and he dreams of himself being Sherlock Jr. When this happens the movie steps out of being a great one and becomes a masterpiece of camera trickery done so well indeed by Byron Houck and Elgin Lessley and that's not to mention the editing which is considered by editors themselves to be some of the best there is in film. The stories dream is magical, Keaton's stunts whilst in his dream and also out of it are mind blowing and done to such a degree that you fall in love with his acting skill.\n\nAt such a short running time you might expect not much and the chances of you loving this slim, well think again because this is probably the shortest film I have seen where I have already connected with the characters in the first 5 minutes. Keaton is incredible in this; many a fan of his and of silent film will point to \"The General\" as his greatest but for me this is Keaton not just at his stunt doing best, but at his most dramatic best too. Clyde Bruckman and the writers make a story that is ingenious and so well done but also well thought of, it's the kind of little movie that stands the test of time simply because it's so easy to watch but also contains such brilliant moments.\n\nAs you might guess there isn't a whole lot to say about a movie that by some organisations standards is not even a full feature film, but I think it is, it deserves credit for what it is and I am sure critics who like it would agree with me. I implore anyone to try this, even if you think you dislike silent movies because this is not only short but actually way more than just good, it is an actor at their finest and that's not to forget the technical team at that too. So overall I just felt Sherlock Jr. was a fine movie worthy of its praise and it's not often I feel such a perfect movie comes along from so long ago that even today is in my opinion an astounding picture, and one that I personally really loved.",

Buster Keaton is great here both in front and behind the camera and this is one of the best edited films ever.

The movie has such a great imagination and authenticity, wonderful humor and terrific action sequences and it is just an endearing film that is charming from start to finish.",

            "content": "The only other Buster Keaton film I have seen is The General, which I know is regarded as his best, and I really love that film. With Sherlock Jr. we get a simple tale (which is always a better way to go with silent films) that is delightful in that we root for Keaton who plays the underdog of the story. Sadly, it doesn't live up to the status of The General.\n\nAs an early silent film, this movie sets a precedent for thinking about film - about half of this film is a dream sequence in which the film projectionist played by Keaton gets intertwined in a \"movie\" about his girlfriend and the man who framed him for stealing her father's pocket watch. Before the story of the dream begins, we have an out-of-body experience from the Keaton character who is interacting with what is presented on the movie screen.  This is the greatest sequence of this shorter film in my opinion as it has the audience think about their relation to the film when they go to the movies, and it uses humor by having Keaton's character clumsily fall over various times when the setting of the film changes and he remains constantly on the screen.\n\nA shorter film is great since its focus is simple and doesn't leave the audience bored with unnecessary content, but I feel this film was actually lacking content. I know this was released in the very early days of narrative cinema, but more character development could have helped this story as well as just a little bit more complexity in the plot.  This film has its moments with great humor, but it is not one of the better silent comedies.",

He is sending for the world's greatest detective - Sherlock Jr.!\"\n\nAfter watching several of Chaplin's classic films, I decided it was time to give Buster Keaton an opportunity beginning with one of his most revered movies, Sherlock Jr. Keaton and Chaplin dominated the silent movie era, but most people are divisive as to who was the most talented actor-director of that time. So far I'm on Chaplin's side although I still have to give Keaton another shot with The General. Perhaps the problem I had with Sherlock Jr. is that I'm not a big fan of surreal films. I know everyone seems to love this genre, but there are very few surreal movies that work for me. I can see how Buster Keaton garners recognition for his magical work in this film, being one of the first to actually incorporate dream sequences into his movie. Many other films (and especially cartoons) were inspired from several scenes in Sherlock Jr, like the one in which Keaton's character jumps into a movie screen and becomes a character in the movie that is being projected (better known as \"the movie within a movie\" sequence). There are several action scenes including some spectacular chases that make you wonder how Keaton could have shot them way back in 1924. I was more impressed with this wizard like aspect of Keaton than on his comedic performance. His deadpan expressions were outdone by the gadgets he devised to create such advanced special effects. Despite being bored by the story, I have to give Keaton credit for his inventive and magical sequences.  \n\nAt the beginning of this silent film, written by Jean Havez, Joseph Mitchell, and Clyde Bruckman the title card reads: \"There is an old proverb which says: Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both. This is the story of a boy who tried it. While employed as a moving picture operator in a small town theater he was also studying to be a detective.\" We are then introduced to the projectionist (Buster Keaton) who is reading a detective book instead of cleaning up the theater. After work, he goes to visit his girl (Kathryn McGuire) and buys her a ring. Another man (played by Ward Crane), who is also fighting for the girl's affection happens to be at the house and steals her father's chain watch and incriminates the projectionist. The girl's father (Joe Keaton) kicks him out of his home and tells him never to return again. The projectionist sadly returns to work where he falls asleep and dreams of being a detective in the film that is being projected. In his dreams, he becomes the hero of the film and the adventure begins.\n\nBuster Keaton's film has some brilliant and magical sequences, and I think it is a bit unfair to compare him with Chaplin because he has a very different style. Chaplin has a more humane approach, writes his own stories and composes them as well, while Keaton does some impressive work behind the lens using some trickery. As performers they both have different styles, Chaplin uses a lot of physical comedy while Keaton uses deadpan humor and incorporates a lot of action scenes doing some risky stunts (in the train sequence he actually fractured his neck). Depending on which style you like best, you will probably claim Keaton or Chaplin is better, but it would be unfair to say one is less talented than the other because they both proved to be geniuses during the silent era and have left us with a rich legacy. I can see sparks of both in contemporary film making. Despite not being a fan of this film as much as others I still need to watch Keaton's The General to get a clearer picture of his style.",

In honor of this rare and very monumental occasion I decided to write a review of a great film by the beloved Buster Keaton. \"Sherlock Jr.\" is a silent era poster child for a brilliantly crafted film. Keaton, unlike many of his famous peers, seemed to push the envelope just a bit further and had an affinity for edge of your seat visual stunts that could have nearly killed him during filming. His projects had a tendency to go over budget, but it was well worth it considering you can watch a film like \"Sherlock Jr.\" and still be impressed 90 years later! \"Sherlock Jr.\" along with many of Keaton's other directorial projects is ahead of its time in many ways. The visual effects, stunts and cinematography was very progressive for the time and looked fantastic. The story is fun, witty and includes lots of physical humor (To be expected in a silent film!) Keaton shines as a star and simultaneously as a director. The risks he took performing death defying stunts for the audience's entertainment is shocking yet very admirable. Buster Keaton was a very talented creative mind with an unbreakable funny bone. His legend lives on in films like \"Sherlock Jr.\" and so many more!",

But while Chaplin successfully combined pathos with comedy, Buster has mastered the art of the straight face and stunt work. Keaton has had lots a great work (e.g. The General) but I believe that his greatest accomplishment would be his short comedy Sherlock Jr. \r\n\r\nSherlock does not feature the famous Doyle detective to which the name derives. The movie is instead about a film projectionist (Buster Keaton) who dreams of becoming a detective. He tries to woo the woman of his dreams with material object, though he is so down on his luck. \r\nBut then he is framed by a fellow suitor for the crime of stealing and pawning the watch of the girl's father. Depressed, the projectionist retreats to a movie fantasy world, where he is Sherlock Jr., the greatest detective in the world, who investigates a \"simple\" case of the theft of a necklace, with the help of his sidekick Gillette (\"a gem of a character ever ready in a scrape\"). \r\n\r\nThe movie features impossible-looking effects, stunts and magic tricks, entertain the viewer from start to finish. Its gags are bar none. For example, when Buster decides to \"closely\" shadow his suspect, or when Sherlock Jr. rides a bike driverless all the way to the criminal's location, passing by tons of obstacles on the way, a hilarious road scene that would not be equaled until W.C. Fields' gaspingly funny film The Bank Dick and its climactic chase scene. \r\n\r\nSherlock's inventiveness has the viewer guess how did they did this way back in 1924, especially the scene where Buster literally jumps into the film. So far, I believe it is one of most inventive technical silent comedy I have ever seen. Kudos, Keaton. \r\n\r\n**** out of ****",

Now I have pretty limited experience with silent films; the only one I can actively recall having seen before is The Artist, which you may or may not count, being that it came out so recently.  I was kind of blown away with how charming this is, and I just had a big smile on face for almost the entire time.  When you bring into consideration that this was made back in 1924, that makes it all the more impressive for being so innovative, and for being so ahead of its time.  This is obviously the age before CGI, and even the age before stuntmen, so the fact that our brazen star/director is physically performing every last one of these risky stunts is mind blowing.  It's really fast paced, and being that most of the gags don't play out in the way that you are expecting, it keeps you 100% engaged.  This is clearly a precursor to classic entertainment like Looney Tunes and the Three Stooges, and at 44 minutes, there isn't a single reason why you shouldn't watch this.",

It is quite simply a great comedy, hilarious and despite it's silent nature, holds up pretty well for laughs, not too mention the fantastic stunts Keaton is so well-known for.",

The dream sequence with the movie theater was amazing, really impressive what they were able to do - I have no idea how they did parts of it. The music was amazing too! Most silent films I've seen stick to one genre of music, but this one had quite a variety, and the music itself was very good. A few tracks were surprisingly ahead of its time in general, not only as a soundtrack. Much better than the General, for sure. I feel like the Buster Keaton's humour has not aged as well as Chaplin, but his great stunts and solid directing live on for sure.",

But when he's trying to impress his girlfriend by trying to find out who stole her father's watch, the watch is planted in Keaton's pockets by one of her father's friends, the local oil baron who have a crush on Keaton's girlfriend.\n\nAs always, watching a Buster Keaton film is such a pleasure, to see all his slapstick that to some degree is better than Chaplin in sense of quantity which causes more laughter, at least for me. And Keaton's admiration for the cinema, which is beautifully displayed in the dream sequence where all kind of breathtaking stunts and charades is performed. And all the chasing scenes could be a parody on today's action flicks, only that it was funny before. Sherlock Jr. is certainly one of Keaton's greatest films. Thumbs up.",

The overseeing plot of a man framed by a rival suitor for his sweetheart is standard fare, but the main reason to see it is for the madcap hijinks and an inventive sequence which sees Keaton walk right into a movie screen while the scenery changes around him.",
