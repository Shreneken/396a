    "summary": "After rising through the ranks of her male-dominated profession, idealistic FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) receives a top assignment. Recruited by mysterious government official Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), Kate joins a task force for the escalating war against drugs. Led by the intense and shadowy Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), the team travels back-and-forth across the U.S.-Mexican border, using one cartel boss (Bernardo Saracino) to flush out a bigger one (Julio Cesar Cedillo).",

Killing someone is wrong and generally thought of as evil until it's someone you care about that's been killed. Suddenly, it seems like a logical choice.\n\nAs in life, this movie doesn't have heroes and villains, protagonists and antagonists. Instead it tries to make the point that we are all capable of both good and bad deeds. This is emphasized heavily in the movie through the use of color. The movie is primarily told through the viewpoint of Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) who starts the movie as an idealistic FBI agent. Director Denis Villeneuve chose to represent Macer's initial naivety with vibrant blues. Though as the character interacts with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) she slowly becomes jaded and her clothing slowly fades to grey. So if you're looking for a movie with a happy ending, or one that makes you feel good, this ain't it.",

Takes ages until the plot goes anywhere, but after 2h of waiting for action, you're at least blessed with an end to this tantrum of boredom.",

            "content": "Sicario is one of the best thrillers from 2015 and held my attention from beginning to bitter end.  Even though the film is much more than just an action film, it still manages to keep your undivided attention.  The film is smart, thought provoking, and incredibly suspenseful and it isn't surprising that it is so well received, garnering three Oscar nominations.  Sicario has solid performances from everyone involved and Emily Blunt does a good job at taking on the role of the audience, who like her, are new to the crazy drug world of Mexico.  After a grisly discovery in the opening sequence of the film, she is quickly drafted into service by higher ups to dive in to this new and brutal landscape filled with murders, drugs, money, and assassinations.  Benicio Del Toro gives a commanding and complex performance as a government consultant with a mysterious and violent past.  We learn midway through what has happened in his life to lead him to this point, and it's got him  focused and lethal throughout the film.\n     Anyone who is is not able to view grisly images and intense violence, may not wish to proceed as the film is obviously dealing with some very serious and exceedingly violent themes.  The film has a couple moments that hold it back from perfection, some overly contrived dialogue and some of Blunt's character traits are at times annoying.  What I mean by this is that when you are in this world, even if being thrust into it, you have to adapt quickly or die.  Her character is so focused on doing things by the book, she doesn't see the bigger picture, and at times this gets frustrating.  Looking past these minor shortcomings, the film delivers on the drama and character development as well as the suspense it generates as you are pulled into this new dangerous world.  If not easily upset and don't mind dealing with the heavy themes, this is an amazing film that is both gripping and complex!",

Emily Blunt is terrific as the patriotic but naive FBI agent who volunteers to help apprehend Cartel kidnappers and killers.   She is perfectly vulnerable and human in this difficult role.  Her eyes are opened as she becomes embedded with Josh Brolin, and the mysterious Benicio del Toro.  Daniel Kaluuya is very compelling as Blunt's partner and friend.  Jon Bernthal is always good to watch-whether the part is big or small, and this part is no exception.  This film is riveting, violent, and well done.

The directing is perfect and I feel if there was anyone else working with this script it wouldn't have had quite the same results. The casting is perfect too and these characters have such great chemistry that it's hard to believe they haven't known each other and worked with each other their entire lives.\n\nFor those of you that know me, camerawork is very important to me. Cinematography can make or break a film, and I mean come on it's Roger Deakins. How could I complain?? The shots are gorgeous and the lighting in EVERY scene is perfect (You're going to hear the word perfect a lot in this review). Landscapes are gorgeous and colors are all beautifully matched in every scene. In action scenes, quick camera flips and shaky camera effects are put to use and it really brings you into the scene. Also, he used night vision. WHO IS AMBITIOUS ENOUGH TO DO NIGHT VISION??? Only Roger Deakins. He's a master at his craft and Sicario is a prime example of that.\n\nAcross the board, the writing is amazing. The characters are written to perfection and this script is jarring. A good jarring though, like it's so shocking to where ur jaw drops open but you love that it happened. Some of the lines are like wow. It's emotional and it's suspenseful and it's terrifying at points\u2026 what's not to love? These characters (Alejandro to be exact) are insane. Alejandro is the coolest character I've ever seen in a movie. He is BADDDDD!\n\nThe acting is something to note too because while not all of it is stand out phenomenal, certain characters deliver their roles like no other. Benecio Del Toro and Emily Blunt specifically. Blunt is one of my favorite actresses and Toro is one of my favorite actors of all time so how could I not find their performances outstanding? From facial expressions to combat, to even body posture, the acting is wonderful from everyone. They all do exactly what they need to do but as stated before, Benecio and Emily really stand out in this crowd. \n\nThere's no other words to be said besides this is a masterpiece. Sicario is (as stated earlier) one of my all time favorites, and it gets better with every rewatch. This is a must see film. Absolutely perfect and so entertaining.\n\nAlso, Benecio Del Toro <3",

            "content": "Sicario is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time. It has a fairly complex plot but what really delivers are its troubled characters and environment helped by extraordinary acting (especially from Benicio Del Toro). The movie is undoubtedly dark with the story being based around the ongoing war on drugs and specifically the larger cartel warlords with their hitmen. This dark theme is presented effectively through the characters and soundtrack. Josh Brolin plays a typical anti-hero who is on the side of the law but goes to questionable measures to get things done and Del Toro plays a man who has been scarred by tragedy and has turned to be a hitman for hire. None of the characters in this movie are objectively heroic or moral and this is what makes it so good. Even Blunt's character is flawed in parts, seeming like the heroine but in terms of the story's direction, lacks any kind of relevancy or conviction. However, this is used as a device for the audience to place them into this environment of fear and confusion through the seeming protagonist. For me what also pulls Sicario into one of my favorite movies is its action scenes and set-pieces. They are exciting and tense but not completely unrealistic either with scenes of combat being slightly exaggerated only to make scenes more shocking, to good effect too. The set-pieces in this movie are also very memorable and are well done to fit within the plot seamlessly. Overall, I really like this movie and can't recommend it enough. The sequel isn't too bad either but not the same level as the original.",

The story started out strong with a nice shootout that had some suspense and an intriguing voluntary job offer for the main character, but then not as much happened in the middle, with the suspense and tension mostly disappearing, and the ending was solely focused on the revenge subplot, with a side character taking over for 10 or 15 minutes. I expected lots of action, but a sizeable amount of time was spent on dialogue, which worsened the pacing, although the film was by no means boring overall. The action towards the end of the film was also rather silly because I can't imagine people from different departments getting into physical fights, being pinned to the ground at gunpoint, or getting shot at by friendlies whilst wearing a bulletproof vest. Then there was an unexpected lack of emotion and emotional impact considering the seriousness of the topic, and the writers clearly favoured the popular 'the war on drugs can't be won' viewpoint. The main character was overly naive (e.g. her decision to point her gun at the assassin was moronic) but largely likeable and received some development, but her partner and several side characters could've been developed more, with the assassin coming across as unrealistically overpowered and skilled, the partner lacking brains, and the boss being a cowboy. Lastly, the acting felt authentic, especially from Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro.",

            "content": "At the beginning of Sicario, the definition of the title is explained. Sicario is the Spanish word for contract killer - a title that makes little sense for large parts of the film, as there is little or no hint of a hitman. But when the strands come together at the end and the final showdown takes place, you realise: this title is a bull's eye. Until it comes to that, an FBI agent is assisted by a mysterious association hired to help fight a Mexican drug cartel.\n\nDirector Denis Villeneuve has done a great job with the cast. Emily Blunt finds herself in a moral dilemma over the mission as the ambitious but little respected Kate Macer within the male-dominated Force. The more she finds out about the organisation, the more suspicious and antagonistic she becomes. This leads to the point where, in the final act, she finds herself walking a fine line between life and death, entering interpersonal spirals. Blunt's performance is serious and tough, which makes Kate stand out as the only relevant female character. This is partly due to her chemistry with Benicio del Toro. He plays Alejandro, one of the group's top commanders. The two share great moments. Every dialogue and confrontation is tense and you never know what's coming next. Del Toro once again completely lives up to his reputation as a specialist in crime films. Like Blunt, he is very serious and at the beginning pretends to be the taciturn and mysterious justice fighter. Towards the end, however, the character takes on a new facet that makes him even more intriguing and fascinating. Alejandro's real intention is only revealed in the very last sequences of the film, resulting in the most memorable scenes and performance in the person of Del Toro. Josh Brolin, as the slightly lazy head of the organisation Matt Graver, stays rather in the background of the action. He is responsible for the comedic patter and wages a subtle small war of toxic masculinity against Blunt's character. Nevertheless, Graver is surprisingly likeable and is given additional elements by Brolin's acting, which then makes a basically generic character more remarkable.\n\nThe stellar performances of the cast are not even Sicarios strongest points. Villeneuve once again manages to build a unique atmosphere. This time it is the irresistible suspense factor which leaves you riveted after the credits. This intensity is everything that a thriller should be about. In addition, there are brilliantly staged action scenes, most of which are very brief but insanely effective. Villeneuve does not skimp on bloodthirsty executions, but authentically presents the stark reality. The fact that these images have such an effect is also due to Roger Deakins' phenomenal camera work. Long shots of the Mexican desert mixed with quick cuts through hectic fight scenes. The only point where Sicario lacks something is in its story. As stirring and realistic as the protagonist's emotional conflict may be, the film often omits not unimportant details that could have made the plot more tangible. There is a need to catch up here, so I'd like to see more of it!",

Tackling similar themes within the world of the Cartel on the American/Mexican border that Steven Soderbergh's top notch Traffic (2000) also dealt with, Sicario is a tighter film, and is a more doom laden depiction of the depravity and realism that faces law enforcement when tackling the drug war on the front line.

            "content": "I expected Sicario to be yet another run-of-the-mill action movie, with no investment in story telling or enriching characters. Sicario is not that action movie. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Denis Villeneuve has successfully created a high octane and tension filled film which successfully explores and exposes the viewer to the untold side of 'The war against drugs'. \nEmily Blunt takes on the role of the film's protagonist, Kate Macer, a young idealistic FBI agent whose will and self beliefs are pushed to the limit as she finds herself amongst those who will utilise any means necessary to achieve a 'controlled' level of order within the drug trade. Josh Brolin's sly and charismatic character helps to shed light on the motives and reasoning for the unorthodox methods used to achieve the 'controlled' order. However, Benicio Del Toro becomes the real star of the show as the mysterious and nonchalant, Alajendro, a hardened South American agent whose revealing past propels the film's themes and motives forward in a believable way which effectively resonates with the audience. \nHowever, regardless of its two hour runtime there were some noticeable pacing issues which arose following the conclusion of the first major act. Unfortunately, it was clear when the story began to deter itself from its previous tense rollercoaster ride to fall into the stereotypical blockbuster ending. This is not a bad thing, in fact I believe it was executed extremely well. I enjoyed the film's serious tone, and was pleased to find that what bombastic action sequences it contained, were not used to overwhelm the audience. \nDenis Villeneuve's directing styles were used to effectively captivate the audience into what would ordinarily be a very dull and somewhat monotone setting. The filmic techniques and the selected visuals coincide to create a tone and theme which greatly enhances the setting, while maintaining a strict emphasis on the film's grim and bleak tone. The choice for the film's musical score is also excellent, providing a foreboding sense of dread which can strongly resonate with the audience. The timbre of the low notes help to elevate the tension within certain scenes. I was pleased to find that all of these elements are used as the true driving forces behind the pacing within the high-tension scenes, and in creating the atmosphere and tone that is noticeable throughout the films duration.\nSicario is a film that sets out to redefine the action movie genre and set aside the typical stereotypes. Looking past the minor hiccups in the form of inconsistent pacing and alternating story goals, Sicario contains a fantastic cast, a (mostly) well written script, and gorgeously effective Cinematography. It reveals itself to be a true reinvention of the action movie genre, and I look forward to more following in its footsteps.\n8/10\n-Z.S",

            "content": "Sicario is a brutal, intense, thrilling movie with some real things to say. First off, the camera work of Roger Deakins is absolutely stunning here. The use of overhead cameras to track the movement of characters weaving through the city in SUVs is mesmerizing. Performances are amazing all around, Blunt is a great audience surrogate and it's easy to sympathize with her character. Del Toro and Brolin are both forces of nature, playing characters that are mysterious and fascinating to watch even as they carry out acts of serious brutality. The writing is brilliant, and the directing is fantastic- this isn't an overly complex story but it is told extremely well. It is a very thoughtful film that opts to allow viewers to make their own judgements, without interjecting hammy dialogue to make their point- they often show rather than tell. **SPOILERS** Basically what I took from it is that the War on drugs, and the behavior of the US and other actors, isn't a black and white situation. The drug traffickers are clearly evil, violent, brutal people who will do anything to increase their profits & power. On the other hand, the government officials (and those working with them) have no restraint in the way they fight back against the cartels. They resort to tactics that could be considered war crimes- torture, murdering civilians, threatening innocent families- all in the name of their \"just\" cause. In the end their goal is revealed to be simple to \"restore order\". In other words, taking out a major Mexican cartel leader so that the Colombian cartel can reassert dominance and bring an order to the drug industry. They admit they can't stop drugs from being trafficked, and they aren't really even trying to do this. In the end Del Toro's character is revealed to be a hitman, hired by the US government, who is out for revenge for the murder of his family. He doesn't care about the drug war, or the innocent lives he ends- he simply wants payback. The US government hires him because he is effective at what he does, but all they really did was to unleash reign of destruction on countless innocents. He completes his mission of killing the drug lord- but only after he murders the family of the Drug lord in front of him in cold blood. The final shots, in which gunshots continue to plague Juarez during a kids soccer game, are a poignant reminder that the cycle of violence will continue- regardless of which kingpin sits on top. And it seems to suggest that the \"War on Drugs\" is a futile effort that doesn't solve any of the real problems behind the violence",

What strikes most - apart from marvelling once again at Deakins' camera work - is the brevity of the film's key scenes; for all that they stick in the memory - and they really do - and for all that individual scenes and the film as a whole are all replete with tension and uncertainty - it races by. Not one scene is a moment longer than it needs to be, and the result is an unforgettable, coherent whole. Del Toro and Blunt are both outstanding, of course. I remember when we first saw this in the cinema my wife felt the ending let down the way the narrative is centred on a woman, forced as she is to compromise. For me, that remains an open question and one I haven't seen addressed elsewhere - but whatever the answer there, it's a remarkable film.",

Playing opposite her is Benicio Del Toro who has mastered the ability of saying everything without even needing to open his mouth, a skill many actors never achieve. A strong performance which makes you really understand his character and also by the end of the film fear him. Josh Brolin is the link between them both, perfect casting again confident in his own ability as to not over act (and ruin) the part and he has great hair.\n\nThe soundtrack is nearly always there phasing in and out, the deep drumming horn noise creates this dark fear around the story making you feel tiny in the scale of the whole plot, try watching this film without the sound on and it has a completely different feel. Finally the technical advisors were spot on, weapons, looks, drills looked all pretty authentic. \n\nHats off to the director Denis Villeneuve for bringing it all together! Amazing film, one of my favourites!",

The story is one of tracking down a cartel leader by any means necessary, as proved later when Kate is led by a mysterious assassin who goes by Alejendro (Benicio Del Toro). Everything from the color of the setting, to the few number of cuts shows how the movie was precisely made for the viewer to be immersed in the unpleasant habitat of cartel riddled territory. The film constantly applies suspense to the viewer, the dark lighting and ominous music makes the viewer clutch their seat even in the least eventful scenes. Blunt provides a great performance, as she sells the idea that the severity of the situations she is put through throughout the movie slowly chisel at her mental health and ideals. Denis Villeneuve's directing gave the viewer a chance to see beyond a screen, and to understand the harshness of current events that are not often talked about in American news. This is a movie which was not created to be idealistic or for the feint of heart, it shows real issues delivered in an authentic manner that creates an unforgettable experience.",

I'd honestly say the first 15 to 20 minutes are great (even shocking), then the film loses some of its momentum in the middle act.  Daniel Kaluuya's character sadly didn't add much to the story either.  The final 45 minutes or so pick things back up (particularly Blunt's encounter with a cartel worker during a one night stand) with a dinner assassination that was handled with silent brutality that left my jaw dropped.  I loved the cinematography and non-sugarcoated realism coupled with Blunt, Brolin and Del Toro's great performances.  The relatively minor pacing issues in the middle act hold it back from being truly great, so at least it's truly good.  It's like a more condensed version of 'Traffic', which won Del Toro an Oscar.",

Mexican cartel dictates how things are done and to finish it they have to push ethical and moral values to the limit. Revenge, terror, killing and lots of right-or-wrong-questions flow at a perfect pace for 2 hours.\n\nAt first sight, I've thought that Emily was not the girl for the job. Too much \"Prada\" too little \"Edge of Tomorrow\" on her resum\u00e9. But maybe it was that mix Denis Villeneuve was trying to show. A girl too focused on her job to take care of herself but also a go-girl when needed.\n\nBenicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin were at their best. Denis couldn't have chosen better. Del Toro was born to do this kind of strong and dark role. And Brolin is that guy on the limit of ethics and morality. The downside of the cast was Daniel Kaluuya's role. I guess it was not entirely Kaluuya's fault. Maybe Villeneuve wanted him to play a righteous and strict guy, but even so, I thought that the acting wasn't top-notch like the others.",

The corpses hanging in Juarez were disturbing \u2014 even more so when you see civilians playing soccer underneath the decapitated bodies, showing this is nothing out of the ordinary. Emily Blount's character became less tolerable as the film proceeded, as she seemed to make stupid decision after stupid decision. I can appreciate her sticking to her morals/values, but there came a point when I didn't think any person, after seeing what she had seen, after knowing what she had discovered, would continue to stick to those same values. Perhaps she's a better person than I am, in that regard. Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) performed in his best role since Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And God was that dinner-table scene good.

The na\u00efve FBI agent Macy doesn't know the actual purpose for the mission and is used by Alejandro aka Medellin played by the Academy Award winner Benicio del Toro. Medellin is a hired hitman, hints why it's called Sicario, for the U.S where he is hired to kill under the radar. The backstory of Medellin is that his family was murdered by a drug cartel and now seeks revenge any way he can. Throughout the whole movie everyone but Macy (Blunt) knows who the actual target is for the mission. Del Toro's depiction of his character Medellin is what makes Sicario such a gawking movie, that tells a story of how dangerous the drug war is on the border. Sicario gives the viewers an eye into the action of what happens when government officials and the infamous drug cartels are put against each other. The character Macy realizes that one should never go up against a Sicario (Medellin) especially the ones that seek vengeance for his/her family. Macy realizes that you are either with him or against him. The ending will leave you with your mouth open, and with the realization that not everything is what is seems, and how some actions are justified and better to keep a secret.

He's an angel of death, and assassin without peer.  And underplays this massively - accentuating the aura of menace pervading each of his appearances.  Josh Brolin has an easier time of it overall, but Emily Blunt, the nominal star name in the credits, has a tough gig to handle; and does so very, very well.\nBut the overal impact with Sicario is the screenplay and the dynamite directing from Villeneuve, where nothing's too hard to show, no mercy is shown to victims on screen or to audiences not perhaps completely ready for the savagery here shown with such graphic intensity.\nThis is a film that set standards of excellence for those following.  There is, inevitably, a Sicario 2 - without Blunt. Unsure if the other cast members revisited their roles from this, the mk1 version, but if they did then the standard of everything is going to have to remain absolutely at fever pitch for the second generation issue to escape unfavourable comparisons with this cruel and merciless piece of film making.\nIt's a fireball of a flick.

I knew I'd like it, I'd heard nothing but amazing things, and five minutes into the movie I completely regretted not watching it sooner. Sicario is, hands down, one of the best action/thrillers of the decade. Director Denis Villeneuve manages to create so much suspense and intensity throughout 120 minutes that at times it's almost unbearable. Needless to say, my fingernails did not survive this movie. The plot itself is fairly basic - the FBI teams up with some shady people to fight a brutal Mexican drug cartel. Emily Blunt plays the young FBI agent recruited into the fight, and for most of the movie the audience is just as confused and suspicious as she is. It delivers plenty of wonderful \"what the hell?\" moments, as you never really get a sense of anyone's true motivations until the end. The performances are universally terrific and the dialogue is sharp, but the main reason the movie works so masterfully is Villeneuve. With the help of some striking cinematography and a brilliant score, he gives us one of the most surprising, tense, and atmospheric thrillers in the history of the genre. If you've never seen Sicario, please don't make my mistake and see it ASAP.",

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve is an extraordinary director having produced such exciting films as Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and while I wouldn't call this film nearly as good as those he still brings unique vision and scope to a story that could easily be clich\u00e9 and dull. Having watched this just a day after seeing Zero Dark Thirty (2012) there were a lot of comparisons to be drawn between the two and while Zero Dark Thirty is helped by this comparison as it does not make the mistakes that this film makes it was still fascinating to see how different filmmakers approach material that is in some ways similar. While crime thrillers are not necessary my favorite genre, they tend to be very male oriented, even I could accept that this film can be exhilarating as while as considering the complexities of the drug war more than the average film does.\n\nFBI agent Kate Macer, Emily Blunt, joins a special task force after successfully leading a raid on a house run by a Mexican drug cartel. She is paired with Matt Graver, Josh Brolin, and Alejandro Gillick, Benicio del Toro, both of whom take actions that she disagrees with in attempting to punish those responsible for the deaths of people attempting to stop the drug trade. Throughout she is manipulated by the two men who use her to lure the men they want dead to them. She takes actions that they disagree with which angers them while she is resistant to condoning their actions while also aware that they are willing to have her tortured. Gillick's backstory is eventually revealed and he violently murders a drug lord who may have been responsible for the deaths of wife and child. Macer is eventually forced to submit to the will of the two men as they express a nihilist view on the war on drugs.\n\nFor all the praise of the performances I found them to be just alright. Blunt is a very capable leading lady as shown by My Summer of Love (2004) and Your Sister's Sister (2011) but here she displays none of the wonderful wit and warmth she brought to those roles and while she is perfectly fine as a relatively vacant young woman angry at how she has been used she can do so much more. Brolin is reliably sage and slightly smarmy as the aggressive Graver and del Toro brings the enigmatic presence that he used to such good use in Traffic (2000) but they had each given very similar performances to greater effect in other films and it was hard not be reminiscent for those films while watching this film. The supporting cast of Mexican actors are impressive as they bring a quiet sense of desperation to their roles as regular civilians but it would have been nice to see a lot more of them.\n\nOne element of the film that was superior to other crime thrillers was the cinematography as the legendary Roger Deakins worked on the film and he can make the reflection of light from streetlamps onto our main characters gorgeous. Most films of this sort look very generic but Deakins captures the Mexican landscape in all of it's ordinariness while still allowing us to understand that this is a dangerous environment to step into. Yes, the film definitely borrows some visuals from the films of Michael Mann but almost all modern crime films are inspired by Miami Vice and Heat (1995) and this film copies that style better than most. I can see why this film received a Best Picture nomination but it is hard to compete with the work of Emmanuel Lubezki on The Revenant (2015).\n\nAt the end of the day I didn't love the film but I can see why it was a financial success and I would prefer that a film like this succeeds over mindless dreck like Avengers: Endgame (2019). Villeneuve's Dune (2020) will be released next year and if he can bring the technical skills that he applies here to that film and extract decent performances out of Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsgard I will be extremely excited to see his future work.",

While the story is engaging I find myself wanting more of a take-away than this film provides, especially with the themes it deals with. Some of the characters' motifcations were more said than acted, which I would have liked to have seen done better. All in all, though, I understand why this was so well received initially, and I recommend it to people who like modern police thrillers (and can handle seeing some cut-up bodies).",

Director Denis Villenueve bathes scenes in a murky yellow that creates a cloud of dread over a lot of the film and dials up intensity really well. He knows how to make you feel uneasy. Cinematographer gets some really cool overhead shots and helps ground you in the Mexico our characters are in conflict with. The heat vision and night vision is poorly executed and took me out of the movie. Benicio del Toro has a major, mysterious presence as an assassin who hides behind a pair of sunglasses. Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt are both fine, not their strongest performances, but they rise to the occasion and deliver decent performances. Sicario doesn't make you choose which side you're on in this elaborate web of federal agents, criminals and all around mayhem and I really like that about this movie. It's not black and white, it's grey. Sicario is really good and Taylor Sheridan has quickly become one of my favorite screenwriters working today.",

            "content": "CONTROL. COMPROMISE. VENGEANCE. \n\nI would credit Sicario as being one of the movies responsible for my deeply-rooted respect and admiration for the medium of film. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and acting as writer Taylor Sheridan's induction into the screenwriting business, Sicario is a tense, thought-provoking thriller that sets the audience on edge and keeps them there until the end credits begin to roll. With each re-watching of the film, one comes to appreciate Villeneuve's moviemaking on a deeper level and the faint subtleties he slips into every scene to enhance the film as a whole. The story follows FBI Agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) as she volunteers for a joint government task force to help bring down the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. Heading up the task force is DOD Adviser Matt Graves (Josh Brolin), a lifelong soldier hellbent on bringing down yet another threat to his country. Acting as Graves shadow is the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) a seemingly reserved man of few words. Agent Macer is thrown into the world of espionage and operations that don't technically exist with both feet, serving as a conduit for the audience who have also never been privy to such things. Villeneuve takes advantage of everything from lighting to wardrobe to help subconsciously tell Sheridan's story. From lighting certain characters so that they faces are in light while others are in darkness to the last scene of the film where Macer is wearing a pure white shirt in contrast to Alejandro's dark suit the director used every opportunity to compare and contrast the characters. Emily Blunt plays Kate perfectly, a by-the-book FBI Agent thrust into a world of wolves that has no ruling law. Macer is understandably upset and thrown off balance by the constantly shifting ground beneath her feet and the audience sees the toll it takes upon the character from the dark circles beneath her eyes and picking her smoking habit up again. Both Graves and Alejandro have lived in the world of shadows for so long that they too are shadows and we see two sides of the coin in their handling of the horrors they've seen and/or perpetrated. Although the movie follows the plot through Kate's perspective, it is Benicio Del Toro's performance as Alejandro that steals the show. Taking over every scene that he is in with his intense, silent demeanor, Alejandro carries himself like a predator, always ready to pounce should the situation call for him to. Graves on the other hand, deals with the dark madness around him through humor, smiling and laughing as though he doesn't have a care in the world when in reality, lying just beneath the surface, is a predator waiting to take down its prey. Throughout the film, the musical score by J\u00c3\u00b3hann J\u00c3\u00b3hannsson enhances every emotion felt in each scene. With a steady heartbeat of drums and deep thrums of string instruments, J\u00c3\u00b3hannsson raises the tension level and sets those watching on edge as they wait to see what happens next. Each character comes into the plot with their own objectives and motivations, Kate desires to strike a blow at the cartels killing innocent people, Graves perceives a threat to the United States of America and is willing to do anything and everything to protect his country, and Alejandro wishes to avenge the deaths of his wife and daughter who were brutally slaughtered by the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. Every step taken leading the climax of the film takes the audience down farther and farther down the very dark, malicious rabbit hole that is the drug trade. This film shows every aspect of how the destructive disease infects and destroys all those it touches and how the United States is searching the vaccine. Villeneuve and Sheridan craft a masterful tale of the chaos that reigns along America's southern border and all of those it affects, showing that in the face of lawless chaos and evil intentions, one must fight fire with fire or be turned to ash.",

            "content": "There's an effective, quiet pall that hangs over every scene of Sicario, an appropriately nervous sense that we have entered into an atmosphere of death. This is refreshingly new. Movies about federal agents at war with the Mexican drug cartels have a tendency to be very slick and unafraid to get into the messier bits of such an unsavory industry. Sicario doesn't do that. Here is a movie that isn't afraid to get its hands dirty. Pulled out of our comfortable American of commercialization, the film takes us into a world that might look right at home in a post-apocalyptic thriller. Yet, this is not about any grand catastrophe between nations; it's about the drug war that stretches from the southwestern United States all the way into the deepest heart of the Mexican desert.\n\nThe purpose of Sicario (which is the Spanish word for 'hitman') is to take us into this world and then ask us a question. Should our federal agents have free reign to move into Mexico and bend the rules in order to crack down on drug lords who are spilling poison into our country and theirs? The answer is not as simple as you might think. It is easy to think that procedures must be followed, that laws must be upheld. But what are our government agents to do when a community has become so overrun by drug cartels that naked, decapitated human bodies are displayed in public as a warning?\n\nIt is a moral dilemma that lies at the door of FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), a relative greenhorn whose experiences are beginning to morph into PTSD. As the movie opens, we find Kate and her fellow agents busting into a house in Chandler, Arizona to find a kidnapping victim. They don't just kick down the door, they're tactics involve driving through the sidewall of the house. After a clumsy gun battle with armed criminals, something comes to light that is first spotted through a bullet hole in one of the walls - a gruesome tableau of death. Bodies wrapped in plastic turn up, rows and rows of them. Who are these men? Why are they here?  And how did they meet such a gruesome fate?\n\nThe search for those answers begins the next day when Kate is hired to join the intra-agency task force that will move into Mexico, and attempt to disrupt the drug business there. Her immediate superior is a smiling wise-guy black-ops cowboy named Matt (Josh Brolin) who isn't exactly loose with the details of their mission. She's none-too-trusting of Matt or his team, and is especially suspicious of a soft-spoken former prosecutor named Alejandro (Benecio Del Toro), a hulking specter whose positioning in this mission has a lot more to do with breaking down the cartels then meets the eye.\n\nTraveling into Mexico with Matt's squad, Kate is appalled by the lack of procedure at hand.  What they do, and how they get information.  What is most galling to her is that Matt and his team are not interested in arrests but in getting to the kingpin at the center.  The method (as spelled out in the trailer) is to stir the pot, the create a war within the community that will smoke the head man out.  What seems reasonable to everyone else, is appalling to Kate, who still believes that policy and procedure must be observed.\n\nThat, really, is the movie's weak point.  Kate spends the entire movie in private protest over what is going on and how things are being handled.  We, in the audience, applaud the men who are willing to bend the rules.  We understand that they are operating in a den of vicious animals, and certain lines must be crossed, but Kate remains in protest long after it might have seemed that she would come around to their way of thinking.  One might think that she would either be on board for this, or be sent home.\n\nI was also put off by the movie's third act, where it might have been interesting to see where the infiltration effected the cartels themselves.  Instead the movie turns inward and becomes a more personal drama leading to a showdown that has little if any real resolution.\n\nThose objections aside, this still a very good movie.  It was directed by Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve who made the excellent kidnapping drama Prisoners two years ago.  What he shows in both films is his ability to orchestrates scenes.  The scenes involving the feds infiltrating the inner sanctum of the cartel are handled very well because we understand it as part of the story, not as a series of confused editing as a Michael Bay film might.  Villeneuve has the patience to tell this story as it unfolds rather than make it all obvious in the first few minutes.  He gives us that sense that we are wandering through the valley of death where bloody violence springs up out of nowhere and human life is meaningless.  It's not a perfect movie, but it is a very well made movie, one that has you thinking about it afterwards.",

The protagonist spends most of the movie looking doe-eyed and useless while other times emotional and distressed. I happen to like Emily Blunt but she was starting to reek of miscast here. Maybe this is just not my type of movie but it was not a tightly wound thriller nor attention-getting. At the end of it, I did not care what happens to any of the characters.",

This is people who do various choices to determine their humanity as human beings and of course to save them from the choices they choose. It's a movie that doesn't give any answers at all.

            "content": "\"Your asking me how a watch works\" is what Alejando (Benicio Del Toro) says to Kate (Emily Blunt) when she asks him about the cartels in Mexico. Clockwork is a perfect analogy for the events that take place in this film because nothing is simple or clear cut, yet everything is connected. Denis Villeneuve the director does a fantastic job of pulling the viewer in and painting a vivid picture of life on the U.S. Mexico border. \n\nSicario is a gritty suspense filled action film that doesn't sugarcoat much. The film itself is shot almost like a documentary in a sense because there is nothing very dramatic or far fetched about the storyline itself. One might say it almost feels like an AE special about the cartels and law enforcement featuring A-list actors Benicio Del Toro, Emily Blunt, and Josh Brolin. Kate, played by Emily Blunt, is the main character of the film and Cinematographer Roger Deakins and Writer Taylor Sheridan do a brilliant job of putting us in her shoes. \n\nKate is appropriately the main character because she is a textbook FBI agent who always seeks justice but never likes to stray from the rule of law. The film quickly takes us into a world that couldn't be further from the rule of law when Emily Blunt's character agrees to join a task force to dismantle a cartel. We follow Kate's character as they venture into Mexico, to the lion's den that is cartel territory.\n\nRoger Deakins gives us plenty of aerial and panned out shots of the grim and unforgiving terrain of Mexico and the Southwestern United States. Overall the Cinemaphotography feels organic and authentic to the world the story takes place in. Character scenes are shot up close and personal so the viewer sees, hears, and feels every piece of dialogue and emotion. The emotional acting of our main character Kate can be felt at every twist and turn and reaches a pinnacle when she realizes some of Alejandro and Matt's ulterior motives. Kate then faces some hard moral dilemmas that might cost the agent her life.\n\nSicario is a must see, and begs to be viewed a second time to be properly understood. Gripping and suspenseful with no happy ending, this film is not for the faint of heart. Alejandro sums of the film perfectly in the end when he says, \"This is the land of wolves now\".",

Emily Blunt's character wasn't so necessary, she had no goal but just going with the waves of this movie, but with her amazing performance, she convinced me -or I pretended being convinced- that her goal is cleaning the world of it's dark crimes, but for me, it's uneven.\n\nSome scenes were so confusing, and there was nothing to give any hope, it's just dark.. from the beginning to the very very end!\n\nThese are the flaws of this movie, everything else was well made.. the breathtaking scenes mixed with amazing performances with great story.\n\nSicario is a great movie, and I'm gonna give it an A-.\n\nAlright, next one is Sicario: Day of the Soldado, stick around.

Benicio Del Toro (Alejandro Gillick) is outstanding. He doesn't have a ton of lines, but he commands the screen each time you see him. There's a chilling aspect to almost everything he does. Emily Blunt (Kate Mercer) is also great as the lead. She sells the combination of being terrified and still being tough, which is not easy to balance. Josh Brolin (Matt Garver) and Daniel Kaluuya (Reggie Wayne) were both also strong in their roles. There are some clever twists throughout that keep you on the edge of your seat. \n\nWeaknesses: The plot is a straightforward one that doesn't stand out as something special. It's simple and to the point. Some moments paint Blunt's character as being more incompetent than she should be considering her position within the FBI.

            "content": "Well, after nearly three years of avoiding it, and with needing the knowledge of the original before seeing \"Day of the Soldado\" tomorrow, I have finally watched Denis Villeneuve's \"Sicario\".\n     Emily Blunt plays Kate Macer, a member of the FBI asked to join in with Matt Graver, played by Josh Brolin, and his shady assistant from Mexico, Alejandro Gillick, played by Oscar-winner Benicio del Toro. Their goal? Bring down Manuel Diaz, the lieutenant of the Sonora Cartel.\n     Pretty simple story, huh? Yeah, I thought so too. It's the reason this film doesn't have a full five stars. Sure, the story is elevated by a few clever twists, but that's about it. Another thing is that keeps the score at four-and-a-half is the fact that, while the complexities and ideas that are mentioned throughout - that the world isn't black and white - are still relevant, I don't find them as having much of an impact as they should, because so many movies I've seen have already done that idea to death. \"American Hustle\" did it, the \"X-Men\" films do it, \"I, Tonya\" did it, and the list goes on. Nothing new here, but that doesn't mean it's still done great. I believed everything going on on the screen.\n     Now, onto the positives. The cast, I mean, holy fucking shit! THEY'RE AMAZING! However, I must give applause to Benicio del Toro, who I am so glad has returned for the sequel. He is brilliant here. Surprisingly, he is a man of few words in this film, but despite this, he commands a serious presence whenever he's on screen. He ranks as one of my favorite actors now. Josh Brolin comes in a close second for me, as he has way more lines than del Toro. However, he conveys a passion and power on screen that perfectly balances out.\n\nOverall, a solid film. I'm going to give it an A.",

What it is is riveting on every level. From the script, to the direction, to the cinemotography, the performances, the editing, and the score. All of it\u2019s elements blend into a searing mediatation on intensity. You have know idea what is going to happen in any given scene, and you have no idea where it is going until the very end. Your experience mirrors that of the protagonist, an FBI agent played by Emily Blunt. A raid on a drug house uncovers far more sinister activities, and Blunts character is thrown into league with CIA spook Josh Brolin, and his enigmatic henchman played by Benecio Del Toro, in order to push back on the drug cartels. We assume we are with the good guys, but everyones intentions and motivations are opaque. Something is happening, we kind of have an idea, but the what, the why, and even the how is just beyond our reach. Things are not hidden so much as out of focus, the suprise of the end is not a twist, but the sudden ability to see things that were there all along. The mystery plays out with steady intensity, across Roger Deacons lushly shot landscapes, and as Johan Johansonans eerie dissonant score drags you to the edge of your seat. On repeated viewing it loses little of it\u2019s intensity. It is about these characters, and it is about what is happening to them in this moment. It feels captured rather than constructed, and it is solid entertainment throughout. ",

Gritty realism and a grim mood prevail throughout, with brutality giving a rough edge to the action on the ugly, lawless border areas where drug cartels do battle with law enforcement willing to suspend all rules. Benicio del Toro is especially good in this, portraying an emotionally ravaged character trying to exact revenge for the murder of his wife and daughter by members of a drug cartel.  The theme is essentially good guys are no better than bad guys they are charged with bringing to justice when they must resort to the same violence and amoral behavior.  This is injected into the fight against drug cartels, and the personal struggle of a female agent who objects to the methods used by those around her who are convinced there's only one way to keep control of the drug world while never ridding society of the criminal element altogether.  I also appreciated the subtle, low-key and moody music that is used sparingly.  It's so refreshing to watch a film that depends on its acting performances, visuals and story line rather than resorting to artificial mood from overbearing soundtrack music.",

The cinematography was beautifully done in certain moments, and though the vibe was firm and familiar there was an edge that proved vulnerable, which for action movies in this category is crucial and almost poetic. Despite strong moments, however, there were also negatives. The lack of a resolution to multiple parts of the plot left the movie in a weird haze, and some of the dialogue was just so damn boring. At times Sheridan attempts too much at once, while not focusing on making a single aspect as well as he can.

Benicio Del Toro is brilliant and the most interesting character, Josh Brolin does very well and Jon Bernthal is excellent as always in what he is given. Emily Blunt as the protagonist seems to get a little lost and doesn't seem to be the best character to be following but as the story plays out this begins to make more sense and work in her favour.\n\nI felt that Sicario starts very strong, keeps building throughout with much tension, drops off a little in the 3rd quarter but comes together tightly for a brilliant finish.",

That in-the-moment tension is brought by the fact it takes its time, but is also helped hugely by great performances from Del Toro and Emily Blunt, as well as an incredible score from J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson and unsurprisingly stunning cinematography from Roger Deakins.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: On the other hand, rather like with 'Prisoners,' you can't help feeling all of that is a very gripping and beautiful mask for something that actually holds a fairly weak base indeed. Yes sadly the characters are vastly under-written, and only fill equally evil sides of a fairly simple thematic message. From there, the plot is fairly basic, and all-in-all it consequently lacks ability to engage beyond the nail-biting grit and visual splendor.\nVERDICT: 'Sicario' may have you in some moments, but the overall piece is sadly a very mind-numbing, if mostly admirable film.",

It makes the whole action too concocted for my tastes.\n\nEven though all the praise for the directing and acting is well-deserved, I found more of my time procured with how dense a person would need to be in order to behave as Blunt's character did. Regardless of one's moral fiber or stubbornness could account for such unbelievable behavior.\n\nAs such, the movie was  a 75 for me. As an example, a story can have over-the-top characters and still have them credible. A great example is the character portrayed by Javier Bardem in \"No Country for Old Men\".

Agent Kate has been enlisted by a task force, led by Alejandro, to help them in their war on drugs in the border between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nStandout performances from Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro complement the film's theme, showing that there is nothing glamorous about the implications of the ongoing war against drugs. You see the distinction between Kate and Alejandro, Kate's committed yet confused and troubled by how they conduct their investigation.

            "content": "The \"War on Drugs,\" or even illegal drugs themselves, is a tricky cinematic subject; the material is rife with potential for action-based set pieces, but filmmakers need to be careful with their overall \"message.\"  All it takes is a few wrong notes in either one direction or another and the movie could end up being either too preachy or too bleak.  Steven Soderbergh's masterful ensemble 2000 film \"Traffic\" is a brilliant example of how to do it properly, and now you can add Denis Villeneuve's \"Sicario,\" one of the best films of 2015, to the short list as well.  The two would actually make for a great double-feature, as they both take the drug trade seriously while simultaneously recognizing that this whole effort may be a futile endeavor on the part of our country.\n \nEmily Blunt stars as a hardened FBI agent firmly entrenched in the War on Drugs.  As the film begins, she and her partner (Daniel Kaluuya) lead a raid on a drug den later revealed to be operated by a dangerous cartel based out of Mexico.  Although the bust is made, it comes at a cost, and ultimately the agents know this won't have any lasting effects on the ongoing War.  A minor drug bust matters very little to a cartel that has millions of dollars at its disposal.  To that end, Blunt is recruited into a specialized government anti-drug special task force, led by Josh Brolin, where she is told that maybe now she'll be able to make a difference.  Aiding this team is a mysterious consultant (Benicio Del Toro) who possesses both deadly skills and an intimate knowledge of the cartel they're targeting.\n \nIt doesn't sound like anything special, but Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan have crafted a film that moves with razor-like precision; nothing feels glamorous or \"Hollywood-ized,\" and it works brilliantly as an exercise in prolonged tension.  This is not strictly limited to set pieces (although the film does have its share of those, like a suspenseful motorcade drive across the U.S.-Mexican border and a daring, nightvision-utilizing trek through an underground tunnel).  Much of the time the tension stems from characters-and the audience-not being sure of the motivations of other characters.  Brolin and Del Toro are so secretive that we begin to wonder just what their end-game is, and, perhaps more importantly, why they've brought on Blunt in the first place.\n \nI also liked that the film seems to be aware that, just like real life (and, as mentioned above, just like \"Traffic\"), there is no easy--or, more disturbingly, permanent--solution to the whole thing.  We can tell that Blunt is good at what she does, and she's not a na\u00efve greenhorn to the drug-tackling business.  Yet the film implies that, despite that, she may be a bit too idealistic, something that Brolin and particularly Del Toro recognize almost immediately.  \"Sicario\" is full of painful lessons, but one of the hardest is that, in order to make any kind of progress in this dirty business, one may have to be willing to compromise, particularly when it comes to one's values.\n \nThis aspect of the film is likely to anger some viewers, but I sense a hard-edged truth there that I found both interesting and unsettling.  This actually makes the film a bit different than \"Traffic,\" as although that movie also dealt with difficult truths, it also provided a larger degree of hope, and the compromises the characters had to make didn't feel as drastic.  \"Sicario\" takes a worldview that is considerably more despondent.  That doesn't make it better or worse; it's just another side of the same coin.\n \nAnchoring the film are the fine performances by the three leads.  Emily Blunt has become one of my favorite actresses.  She's shown before that she can handle steely, action-oriented roles (see also the superb \"Edge of Tomorrow\"), but her part here goes deeper than that.  She's clearly capable in the action scenes, but she projects a sort of melancholy world-weariness in the quieter ones, and this where her work stands out the most.  Her banter with Daniel Kaluuya, who's also quite good in a smaller role, feels warm and genuine.\n \nThis is one of Josh Brolin's finest performances, infusing his character with a sort of flippant casualness that flies in the face of all the mayhem he's embroiled in.  As for Benicio Del Toro, the common link between \"Sicario\" and \"Traffic,\" his work is likely to go more unnoticed since his role isn't as \"showy\" as some of the others, but his stoic presence wonderfully conveys a sense of authority and experience as well as a dash of menace, which is crucial to both the character and the proceedings.\n \nThis is a great film, the kind you immediately want to watch again after it's over.  If you haven't already seen it, check it out.",

Emily Blunt is great as an idealistic FBI agent who stumbles into this world with Josh Brolin.

It's a bit of a Western shoot em up but with the claustrophobic sense that the problem cannot be solved by more violence from the gun-slinging cowboy (cowgirl).  Instead the movie offers real people involved in complex situations of violence and desperation.  Some great analysis has been done on the various scenes, especially the gun fight in the toll booth; but what I was moved by was the humanity of the thugs who get creamed by the CIA agents.  Yes they were gangsters and bent on horrible violence, but the way Villeneuve treats them they have moments that reveal their fear, their indecision, their attempt to muster the grit to perform the violence... in short, their humanity.  They are no more cardboard characters than anyone else in this fine movie.  Great story, camera work by Deakins, music by Johannsson, directing and pacing are great - moments of extreme tension throughout the movie.  The violence, language, are not gratuitous but work to further the vision of the movie.  Really fine piece of cinema.",

It's beautiful to listen to as well with a powerfully intense score that draws you into the characters emotions. Johan Johansson who also worked with Denis Villeneuve on Prisoners, is quickly becoming one of my favourite musical composers for film.\n\nA strong cast with an amazing performance from a favourite of mine, Benicio Del Toro. Benicio portrayed a character that was intriguing and unpredictable, adding to the intense feel of the film. I was also pleased to see Daniel Kaluuya, Posh Kenneth from Skins, performing in this film. A nice surprise and a good performance from him and the rest of the cast. \n\nThe only thing that lets Sicario down? The story. I feel it had a good base narrative, but I expected it to go into more detail and become a more immersive experience as a viewer.

Slow-burning intensity with a great deal of intrigue.  Not your average cops-and-drug-dealers story in that, like the lead character, the viewer is kept in the dark about much of the objectives of the mission.

Less action for her in this, but enough, and she does well.  I can see her being the go-to female action star for a few years to come.\n\nGood support from Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro and Daniel Kaluuya.\n\nThe end message is a bit unsatisfactory and the target for derision too easy, and those would be the main negatives.

Their amoral commitment is far more interesting than Macy's moral tergiversation. \nThe film's brutal depiction of the borderland's social and political battles is actually as intelligent as the great classic Traffic as the film seems to have a nuanced understanding of how even everyday people's lives are thrown into disarray.\nOverall, if only the protagonist wasn't such a boring character, this would've been an incredibly compelling film.",

            "content": "***** Excellent\nDirector Denis Villenueve has imported in a tour-de-force picture in \"Sicario\". The movie stars Emily Blunt as FBI Agent Kate Mercer. She is recruited by the mercy (sort of, kind of) of a U.S. government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. Half mercy on Mercer because even though she volunteered for the journey, this is not what she envisioned it to be. Josh Brolin co-stars as the Government Agent Matt Graver who does not want to dig his own grave in this dangerous mission, so he manipulates Mercer in ways I will not reveal. At the center of this mission, is the mysterious Alejandro played by Benicio Del Toro. Villenueve marveled in his orchestration of \"Sicario\" by keeping it tense and unpredictable. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay was a little bit of a bust, but not so much to lessen the movie's strength. Blunt delivers the best performance of her career as Mercer; and Mercy, Mercy, Me why in the world was she not nominated for a Best Actress Oscar! Brolin was his usual steady self in his work as Graver. Del Toro was the scene stealer of the movie though, and there were plenty of hits to that statement; I will just leave it at that. \"Sicario\" is sic!! And A must see, so open your borders for it.",

He's somehow part of the Medellin cartel but is recruited (?) to take on one of the Mexican drug lords.\n The action scenes are generally put together pretty well though there was a bit of fantasy since the characters are not concerned about the press as they shoot up several car-fuls of bad guys in the middle of a busy traffic . I mean this is the age of instant streaming using cell phones etc.! \nStill, a pretty amusing movie if you can ignore Blunt as Kate and just enjoy Toro being moody. Three stars.",

The story unfolds slowly and methodically, and we see everything through the protagonists eyes as they're widened by a world she was aware of but could not fully contemplate. Many of the action scenes, which in a typical modern movie would be set to a heavy, pounding score, are done with almost no music at all. It might come across as boring and uninvolving to some, but to me it felt like the movie was truly mimicking real life, where these moments have no soundtrack, and all you can hear is what is happening all around you. At times the film does feel like it's spinning its wheels, and many of the acting turns seem dialled down so low they might as well be sleepwalking, but it makes their lash out moment feel more genuine and deserved. If you like a tense movie that takes its time, builds atmosphere and character and doesn't simply rush between action scenes, Sicario is well worth your time.",

            "content": "\"Sicario\" is an amazing drama/action movie of 2015. The plot to \"Sicario\" is an F.B.I. agent named \"Kate\" portrayed by \"Emily Blunt\" is working in \"Mexico\" with a team to bring down a large drug dealer. The first scene of the movie is exciting and thrilling; the scene shows the F.B.I. searching through a house where it's believed a drug dealer is hiding. Most of the movie shows \"Kate\" going through a struggle of weather she is doing the right thing or making a mistake. These scenes are great, they show the type of person \"Kate\" is. The film's climax is very unexpected and is a perfect finish to a superb film. There are some scenes of the movie that show the drug dealer and how he lives his life. Those scenes at times can be boring and dull. The movie's plot is great it contains a dark tone; which fits in perfectly. \"Emilia Blunt\" does a stunning performance as the protagonist \"Kate\".  \"Benicoio Del Toro\" also did a splendid job as the character \"Alejandro\". \"J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson\" did an okay job at composing sad and dramatic music, but some scenes the dramatic music is lacking and brings down the movie's quality. \"Sicario\" is filmed well throughout the first part of the film but after the camera quality is not as well filmed. The action sequences in this film are very intense and unexpected which make them even better. As stated before some sequences don't work due lack of good camera work. If you are a person who enjoys dark action films then I highly recommend you watch \"Sicario\" as it has stunning action, good action sequences and a terrific climax. Although the movie has some issues these being a uninteresting side plot, more dramatic music for certain scenes and better camera work. I give 2015's \"Sicario\" a 9/10.",

            "content": "I've been waiting with anticipation for this film for about a year, and let me be honest, it did not disappoint! Sicario, is Canadian director Denis Villneuve's return to storytelling at his absolute best.\n\nThe film takes place in the south of the United States, and Mexico, as FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) joins a team of military personnel to cross into the Mexican border town of Juarez, in order to bring down some of the biggest criminals in the Cartels. Benicio Del Toro plays a former Colombian lawyer Alejandro and Josh Brolin joins as CIA spook Matt Graver. I enjoyed watching their characters interact with each-other and particularly found Emily Blunt a sensitive yet determined agent, despite her lack of physical prowess. Well acted all the way through.\n\nWhat really makes the film a pleasure to watch is how well the story it told through the cinematography and direction of some of the best in Hollywood. In my opinion, Villneuve's Best; 'Prisoners' (2013) was a much more personal story. He takes on a much larger and hugely difficult topic on how the U.S approaches, and deals with the violent drug cartels pushing mostly cocaine and heroin across the U.S/Mexico border. He manages to approach the subject objectively, even though we may not understand the depth of such a difficult problem. I thought the director's style wasn't his usual approach to film making, yet it still has just enough grit and depth of story to make it interesting.\n\nWell acted, and very well told. In my opinion this puts Villneuve in the top echelon of cinema direction.\n\n4/5",

My last experience with Emily Blunt was an excellent one in Edge of Tomorrow, so I figured I'd give her a second opportunity to impress me.\n\nThe opening scene is enthralling.  From the get go you are fed tension as the FBI raid happens.  The action is smooth and realistic mixed with just the right amount of fear.  By this time, barely two minutes into the movie I had already stopped eating my popcorn due to the interest I had in the action.\n\nWhat follows is an amazing job at isolating Emily Blunt's character, Kate.  Every shot has her being the odd man out.  Isolating her and making her feel alone in club where she does not belong.  It creates a feeling of unease when the interactions between Kate and Alejandro (Del Toro's character) begin.  Not to mention the tension Josh Brolin brings.\n\nThere are small details in the cinematography that make you appreciate the effort that went into making the movie.  The sweeping shots of the US military bases with the rows and rows of helicopters, jeeps, and tanks only help reinforce the seriousness of the situation.  The first of the details that I noticed was when the convoy moved into Mexico and stopped briefly on the street.  There is this small rack focus to the wall where there are posters of young women, presumably missing.  It may be a small detail but it helps paint that bigger picture of a place without order.\n\nLooking back at Roger Deakins' credits, it is no wonder I am in love with the visuals.  Skyfall was gorgeous.  Not to mention True Grit and No Country For Old Men.  Out of his previous works I would have to point to Jarhead, and Sicario having a reminiscent feeling of it, which is a good thing.\n\nOne thing I now regret is not seeing this movie in theaters.  The sound system I have is lacking, but even then I enjoyed what was presented to me.  The low beats, repeating over and over, building that tension and making you clench in anticipation.  The last movie I felt this way about was Rush, and there are few others I feel this way about.\n\nOverall, Sicario is engaging.  It combines the right amount of action with everything else so as not to bore the viewer.  Great visuals, score, acting, and character development.  Everything you could want in a viewing experience.",

They have been assembled to combat the transportation of narcotics across the U.S./Mexican border, and they have a high priority target in their sights.  This is very similar to number of movies we have seen in recent years, and they are usually made my Kathryn Bigelow.  This is very much in the same vein as Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker, and these are all movies that I do like and feel that they are all high in quality, but, at the same time, I can't go without saying that they're all strikingly impersonal, and I never cross that line from liking it to loving it.  Now this came about early enough in the year where it could potentially get lost in the Oscar season shuffle, and for the most part, I would say that it did, only getting a handful of nominations for technical awards.  Nevertheless, this has still been getting very good word of mouth.  It's easy to get into, as it puts you in this Training Day situation of this newbie getting thrown right into the fire, as she is an idealistic girl in this boy's club.  It is so quick that she is thrown into this kill or be killed environment, and you never forget that she is surrounded by a bunch of jackals who determine what's right and what's wrong on a level that's above the law.  It's gritty and it puts you right in the moment, and one of the strongest aspects to Sicario is that you never feel safe.  The best part of Sicario is when they get to Juarez.  Through the entire scene, you are nervous and stressed out as can be.  It climaxes with this traffic sequence that I can guarantee will put you at the edge of your seat.  That said, there's about another hour left in the movie, and the rest of the movie is never as satisfying as that one sequence.  The cinematography is great (Roger Deakins always turns in amazing work), and I really enjoyed the surreal score that added an unexpected element to it.  Sicario is a really good movie, but for me, it falls just shy of being one of the best of the year, and I couldn't find a spot for it on my best of list accordingly.",

Del Toro is still reliable as ever, but both Josh Brolin and especially Emily Blunt do not have any moment to shine with their one-sided characters. As any other film by Denis Villeneuve, the film's technicality is impeccable, but the lacklustre second half really hurts its chance to win major awards.

Beide begr\u00fcnden den folgenden f\u00fcr uns befriedigenden Thriller (und genaus diese Tatsache bereitet mir Magenschmerzen). Wir befinden uns in einem Universum, in dem das B\u00f6se schlicht exisitiert. In dieser Welt kann Gewalt einfach so ausbrechen, Leben nehmen oder niederschmettern. Sicario schafft leider tiefe Befriedigung. Der Film untersucht den Krieg ohne Regeln oder Verpflichtungen mit einem spektakul\u00e4ren Auftritt von Benicio Del Toro und der faszinierenden Cinematographie von Roger Deakins. B\u00f6se Zungen behaupteten, Sicario sei zu ausschweifend und pr\u00e4tenti\u00f6s. Sicario fehle deshalb die Dringlichkeit eines wahrhaft grossartigen Thrillers. Ich muss zugeben, dass mich diese Ansicht w\u00fctend macht, so ergriffen war ich von Villenueves Film. Sicario funktioniert, weil er sich die Zeit nimmt, den Schauplatz der Grenze Arizonas zu Mexikos zu beleuchten. Wie k\u00f6nnten wir uns sonst in dieser unvorstellbar grausamen Welt zurecht finden? In der ersten Szene versucht die FBI Agentin Kate Macy (Emily Blunt) das Opfer einer Entf\u00fchrung in Arizona aufzusp\u00fcren. Kurz blicken wir in ihr Gesicht: Furcht und Entschlossenheit vor dem Zugriff. Sie bricht mit einem Truck durch die Wand eines Hauses, erschiesst einen T\u00e4ter, der seine Waffe gegen sie richtet. In ihren Augen blitzt Verzweiflung auf. Macy ist ausgesprochen menschlich und noch nicht abgestumpft. Ein Schuss reisst ein Loch in die Wand des Geb\u00e4udes und es kommen Leichen zum Vorschein. Mehr als 20, mehr als 30 tote K\u00f6rper. Das gesamte Geb\u00e4ude ist gef\u00fcllt mit Leichen - w\u00e4hrend des schockierenden Anblicks reisst eine Explosion draussen im Schuppen zwei Beamte in den Tod. Macy handelt ohne zu z\u00f6gern und streng nach Vorschrift, was ihre Vorgesetzten beeindruckt. Sie wird vorgeladen zu einem Treffen einer Task Force, geleitet vom mysteri\u00f6sen Matt (Josh Brolin). Seine Identit\u00e4t bleibt wie die gesamte Operation verborgen. Man arbeitet zusammen mit dem d\u00fcster wirkenden Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) - von dem nicht einmal sicher fest gestellt werden kann, ob er nicht einfach nur als S\u00f6ldner dient. ihr Einsatz findet in Mexiko statt und endet blutig. Wo ist der Zusammenhang zwischen dem Leichenhaus in Arizona und der rechtslosen Stadt Juarez in Mexiko? Die Drogen Barone sind dort so prominent, dass sie Leichen verkehrt herum an der Hochstrasse aufh\u00e4ngen k\u00f6nnen. Der Befehl lautet, einen Drogen Schieber zu stellen und in die USA zu \u00fcberf\u00fchren. Auf dem R\u00fcckweg ger\u00e4t der Convoy in einen Stau (man hatte sie vorgewarnt, dass explizit der R\u00fcckweg gef\u00e4hrlich sei). W\u00e4hrend das Unternehmen im Stau feststeckt, blicken wir in verschiedene Autos: Wir erblicken t\u00e4towierte Gestalten, bewaffnet. Die Szene geh\u00f6rt zu den besten in der Disziplin des Aufbaus von Spannung \u00fcberhaupt: Gewalt liegt in der Luft und wird ausbrechen... Das Drehbuch von Sicario entwickelt nicht nur einen Hauptcharakter. Macy nimmt oft nur die Position einer Beobachterin ein, w\u00e4hrend Matt und Alejandro agieren. Sollte es m\u00f6glich sein, dass Macy eben nur zu diesem Zweck angeheuert wurde? Im Kern kreiert Sicario eine Welt ohne Anf\u00fchrer, die im Chaos versinkt. Dementsprechend kann sich Macy w\u00e4hrend des gesamten Films nicht zurecht finden, da keine Grundregeln existieren. Denis Villeneuve kann sich auf die Anziehung Del Toros verlassen, die fast magnetisch wirkt. Ihm geb\u00fcrt der Showdown, der gnadenlos und radikal abl\u00e4uft. Wir merken, dass der Kanadier Villeneuve auch in seinem dritten US amerikanischen Film nicht von Hollywood korrumpiert wurde: Emily Blunt als Heroine? Mir scheint sie in gefangen in einer unerh\u00f6rt altmodischen Frauenrolle, die Hollywood so gar nicht mehr vergibt. Sollte sie jemals aktiv an diesem Einsatz mitwirken oder bloss Bericht erstatten? Rechtfertigt sie einfach nur die Unrechtm\u00e4ssigkeit der Operation? Benicio Del Toro dagegen als dunkler Held? Provoziert der Film, dass wir uns mit seinem Feldzug gemein machen? Bestaunen wir einen Mann, der innerlich l\u00e4ngst abgestorben ist? Ist ausser mir noch jemandem aufgefallen, dass wir Zeuge einer angedeuteten Zuneigung zwischen Macy und Alejandro werden? Ich muss mir Sicario noch einmal ansehen. In diesem Moment f\u00fchle ich mich nur elend und schockiert.",

Starring Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin, the film has an impressive cast that delivers some excellent performances.  And the director brings a lot of intensity and suspense to the scenes.  The film also does a good job at exploring the moral ambiguities and complexities of the war on drugs; however there is a bit of a political agenda at play.  Additionally, there are some weaknesses in the plot and some underdeveloped characters.  Yet while it has a few problems, Sicario, is a dark and edgy film that's quite challenging.",

But this scene is merely the lowest point of a film in which the female lead does virtually nothing but look confused while the men around her boss her around, keep secrets, run the show entirely. We are told at one point she is only around because she is the sole member of the secretive group who is actually a cop. What an honour. \n Besides that, this is really nothing more than another cynical action movie whose entire premise seems to be that the war on drug cartels is a farce (duh), with a lot of shootin' and stuff blowin' up.

Not to mention that the cinematography while great for the war scenes doesn't do much for those character moments at all.\n\nDenis Villeneuve also did Prisoners, and while a beloved film by many it is also lacking and gets hate from those who love it. This director needs to learn how to balance emotional moments with good plot development without making the film feel dull and boring. Sicario just isn't a very interesting and enjoyable film.\n\nEmily Blunt actually gives a pretty bad performance in my opinion. Instead of giving facial expressions of power and strength they feel more lost and diluted.\n\nThat being said Benicio Del Toro kills it with this film.

The whole, nausea-inducing sequence (in terms of both cinematography and graphic content) of the black SUV motorcade entering Mexico with Policia Jeep escorts, getting their man, then instigating a violent bloodbath right in the immigration lanes into the US, was the second-most anxious I felt at the movies this year (second to \"Room\"). Johann Johannsson's ominous, gut-sinking score - with its blend of classic strings and modern synths - is nominated for an Oscar, and rightfully so. \n\nWhat nearly ruined the movie for me, though, is that while this is a story that needed to be told, the creators invented a paper-thin \"tough woman\" character to be the lens through which the story is told. Cold yet vulnerable Emily Blunt plays Kate Macer, a tough woman FBI agent chosen for special ops (why are tough ladycops always named Kate?), but despite her physical toughness, she acts as nothing more than a bland moral compass. Her idealism is hardly motivated at all. Is she haunted by a past case gone wrong? Does she have a backstory for joining the FBI? How did she get so respected in her field of kidnap response? The character is basically there as the audience proxy to question the shady dealings of Benecio Del Toro's Alejandro, who helps the team but for his own reasons. \n\nKate doesn't seem to have agency of her own. Her junior partner is the one to finally get the straight dope from her special ops handlers (and to make some derisive comments about her nonexistent hygiene and beauty routine, ostensibly to make her seem like \"one of the guys,\" but just comes off as unnecessary patriarchal banter), and *SPOILERS* when she does get the gumption to pull a gun on Alejandro and deck Matt, it's like, \"Why would she do that? What makes her so righteous yet foolhardy?\" She fights back, but blindly. Although both Blunt and Del Toro are good in the scene in which Alejandro tenderly threatens her life unless she sanctions their sins in the name of the lesser evil and she pulls her gun on him AGAIN (really?!), Kate's brave resistance is really only written in for show.",

            "content": "Review:\nI must admit, I did think that this movie was going to be much better than it was. I loved the scenes at the end, when Del Toro became a one man army on a mission but the rest of the movie was slightly boring. Emily Blunt plays an FBI Agent, Kate Macer, who finds dozens of bodies hidden in the walls of a house in Arizona, along with her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya). The crime investigating team come across a shed in the backyard, which turns out to be a bomb and detonates, killing 2 officers. Her boss, Dave Jennings (Victor Barber) recommends her to a CIA undercover officer, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), who guarantees that she can get revenge the death of the 2 officers, so she volunteers to join there elite team. They then leave for El Paso in there private jet, we're Kate meets Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) for the first time. When they get to Juarez, they extradite one of Diaz's top men, his brother Guillermo but when they try and cross the border, they sight a group of hitmen in a traffic jam, so the elite force kill them on the spot. When they get Guillermo back to base, they torture and interrogate him and he eventually tells them about a tunnel that Diaz uses to ferry drugs into the US. They then return to Arizona and question a group of Mexican migrants who give them some more information about the tunnel. Meanwhile, Reggie and Kate are fed up with being kept in the dark about everything, so Matt tells them that their goal is to cause a disruption in Diaz's drug operations so he will be called back to Mexico to meet his boss, drug lord Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cedillo). After freezing Diaz's account, Kate tries to build a case against Diaz involving his money transactions but Matt isn't interested in using that route to catch Diaz. She then tries to go to her boss with the evidence but Jennings tells her that they outrank him and if she goes against them, there could be legal repercussions. After a night drinking in a bar, Kate goes home with Reggies friend, Ted (Jon Bertha) and she realises that he has a wristband which is used to bundle Diaz's laundered money. When Ted realises that she knows who he is, she puts up a struggle and tries to shoot him but he knocks the gun away and starts to strangle her. She is then saved by Alejandro, whose was close by, watching her because she exposed herself at the bank. Matt and Alejandro then torture Ted and threaten his friends and family which leads to them getting the names of corrupt cops who are working for Diaz. The next morning, Kate and Reggie realise that they are being used by the elite force, purely to give the CIA the legal ability to operate within US borders. Reggie doesn't want to go any further with the investigation but Kate wants to see the whole thing to the end. After finally getting through the tunnel, Alejandro sneaks through the Mexican side and he kidnaps one of Diaz's mules, whose a corrupt Mexican police officer. Kate follows Alejandro and attempts to arrest him but he shoots her in her bulletproof vest and tells her to return to the US. Matt then tells Kate that Alejandro is only working with them to avenge his murdered wife and daughter. Alejandro then uses the corrupt police officer to catch Diaz and then he kills him and wounds Diaz. Diaz then drives Alejandro to his bosses estate and then he kills Diaz and fights off Alarcon's henchmen. Alarcon is calmly eating dinner with his wife and children and he tells Alejandro that what happened to his family wasn't personal. After killing his family in front of him, he looks Alarcon in the eyes and he shoots him with no remorse. The following day, Alejandro goes to Kate's house and makes her to sign a waiver, by gunpoint, stating that everything that they done was by the book. Kate then attempts to shoot him from her balcony but she ends up letting him walk away. Del Toro is definitely the best character in this movie and his calm demeanour, even though his family was brutally murdered, was great. The only problem that I found with the film is that it takes some time to get going and you don't know what really is going on until the end, so you are kept in suspense through most of the film. Emily Blunt just wants to expose everything before she actually knows what's going on but I did like Josh Brolins character, who used brutal tactics to get the job done. Anyway, I personally enjoyed the movie, mainly because of the ending and I can't wait to see how Del Toro's character will progress in the sequel. Enjoyable!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nRound-Up:\nThis movie was directed by Denis Villeneuve, 48, who brought you Prisoners in 2013, with Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal and Enemy which also starred Jake Gyllenhaal. He's rumoured to be directing the next Blade Runner, along with Story of Your Life starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker so he's obviously gained some respect, due to the success of this movie. I liked the way that he showed the different points of view in this movie, like the corrupt cop with his family and there is a sense of authenticity which made it feel real. I just hope they don't mess up the sequel, if they ever do release one!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: $30million\nWorldwide Gross: $80.5million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/dramas starring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro, Jon Bernthal, Victor Garber, Daniel Kaluuya and Jeffrey Donovan. 7/10",

            "content": "I like that we begin \"Sicario\" thinking it's going to be a gritty battle of good vs. evil, only to realize sometime during its middle half that that's, unfortunately, wishful thinking.  It is a merciless depiction of the war on drugs, so authentically dogged that we, sooner or later, come to the conclusion that we're witnessing a war that perhaps can never be won, and this cynicism is as frightening as it is brutally watchable - it is a tremendously effective film.\n\t\"Sicario\" is French director Denis Villeneuve's third American feature, following in the footsteps of critically acclaimed kidnapping drama \"Prisoners\" (2013) and indie horror fantasy \"Enemy\" (2014).  We can establish that Villeneuve is not a filmmaker comfortable with being confined to one specific genre, but clear is that he is a stunningly confident master of his craft, able to give a project of any means artistic strength that has helped in his quick rise to the top of the most remarkable modern cinematic talents.  Having only seen \"Enemy,\" which mostly, despite having interesting moments, turned me off with its existentially based quasi-terror, \"Sicario\" is a head-turner and certainly one of the best directed films of 2015.\n\tI'm not so sure it's a masterpiece, as its focus isn't as tightly wound as we might expect and because having a firm grip on the pitfalls that could occur during its scenes of suspense aren't always crystalline.  But, nevertheless, the film is galvanizing, thought-provoking, and convincingly bleak - I especially like the way its moral ambiguities slowly reveal themselves to be unsteady after we've long decided that \"Zero Dark Thirty\"-esque good is where everything is headed.  Its final act is a terrifyingly visceral knockout.\n\tIt also features career high performances from its refined cast: here, Emily Blunt redefines herself in her most challenging role to date, quixotical FBI agent Kate Macy, a specialist in kidnapping cases.  The film, harrowingly, opens with a bulleted raid of a suburban home (headed by her) that leads to the discovery of scores of corpses, all presumed to be hostages victimized by the drug trade.  The scene quickly goes awry (a bomb is accidentally denoted and kills two officers), but her expertise does not go unnoticed.  Recruitment for aid in the war on drugs soon reaches her, despite no prior experience in the category.\n\tWith superiors (Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro) whose questionable ethics lead her to ponder just how far she's willing to go to ensure justice, Kate is brought into a dangerous world where surviving lets itself be known as something perhaps more vital than being spotlessly moral.  By \"Sicario's\" end, we aren't surprised to find her shattered, unsure of where to go next in her career.\n\tI suppose I could go further in depth regarding \"Sicario's\" plot, but as we mostly live vicariously through Kate, who spends much of the duration unsure of what's going on herself, an appreciation of the chaotic, oppressively violent interior of the film is necessary to decipher an ultimate emotional reaction.  Perhaps \"Sicario\" isn't so refined narratively, never really deciding if Blunt's Kate or Del Toro's mysterious Alejandro is the real main character, but what it lacks in plot central cohesion is made up for in arrant ardency, found in its direction and its acting.\n\tBlunt and Del Toro are particularly marvelous.  Blunt, more or less the moral center of the film, vivifies her characterization through persuasive fearfulness that sometimes causes us to forget just how courageous of an individual Kate actually is.  When \"Sicario\" finishes and she's no longer the person who believes that being essentially \"good\" is enough to make it in this world, we're left genuinely devastated.  Del Toro, as Blunt's superior whose affiliation to the law is never clearly stated, gives one of the best performances of 2015, his kept-secret personal vendetta against the drug force moving enough to cause us to question how far our sympathies can go.\n\t\"Sicario\" is never simple, and the more we let it sink under our skin, the more we become inclined to analyze the complexities of virtuosity itself.  Villeneuve is a director destined to become increasingly notable in the film industry; Blunt and Del Toro strengthen the awe that has become them.",

Something that impossible to do without international cooperation. Every raid is done in secretively, sometime if required at any cost in whatever effort to stop it. Like I said, this was an awesome movie, and good to see it after the documentary like 'Cartel Land'.\n\nThe story is kind of hard to detail it out, because it was more an action movie than the talking. How a special force unit goes after the bad guys and stops them is the main plot. But the characters were so distinctive, every main roles had their own agenda for what they are doing and that's how the narration dominated with the high standards.\n\nThe cast who played them were simply outstanding, including that starts with Emily Blunt, who is someone looks changed the attitude to play physically challenging roles after 'Edge of Tomorrow'. And then Josh Brolin and another one, an upcoming young British actor who I really don't know, but Benicio Del Toro was actually the show stealer.\n\nHis part was unexpectedly great, totally raw and aggressive. Especially the his end scene, no one could have guessed it, but that's how the way it is. No doubt any top actors would have denied to perform that, anyway well shot with minimum violence, but the intention was very clear as fighting against the dark forces to cut off the head first. One of the best movie of the year, so definitely recommended if you're interested.\n\n8 1/2/10",

It's a great reminder\nof Del Toro's talents and the arc of his mysterious character Alejandro\nis one that elevates the film whenever his on screen.\n\nSicario is easily one of 2015's most accomplished thrillers and an\nuncompromising look at how the drama playing out daily in Mexico\nthrough its illegal activities is steadily finding its way into the\nland of America whether the nation acknowledges it or not. Cold as ice\nbut on fire in many departments, Sicario is sleek Hollywood movie\nmaking and another win for director Denis Villeneuve in what's quickly\nand assuredly becoming quite the career behind camera.\n\n4 interrupted family dinners out of 5\n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

With veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins, he made something suspenseful.\n\nI like how this film brought a simple idea about the Mexican border drama into something scary and very satisfying thiller-drama.\n\nEmily Blunt was right for the cast - as a person that can be identified as us, who always tries to do something \"by the book\". Especially Benicio Del Toro, he made a comeback from playing some high-dude collector in Guardians of The Galaxy (2014). His mysterious character made the film looked more than a simple thriller. My dad, usually predicts what a character might do, but he couldn't predict him. Watch the climax of the film, you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nAlso the cinematography was great. The technical side of the film was very complex, but yet looked realistic. The old man really knew what he was doing since the 1980's.\n\nBesides that, I really like to hear the film's sound design and foely, it sounded so realistic. It build more of the suspense.\n\nAs for the writings, there were plot twists all over the place, but the most surprising one was on the climax. We really don't know what Benicio Del Toro's and Josh Brolin's character motivation for  3/4 of the movie. Once we knew it, OH SHIT, this is fucked up.\n\nI bet this film would be in one of Oscar's nomination.\n\nThe Verdict:\nSicario is one of the most suspenseful film of the year, with strong cast, plot twists, and technical (cinematography and sound).",

She basically cringes in every scene she's in and fails to do anything really meaningful except in her first scene with the group making a key kill. \n\nBut she's relegated to the sidelines for almost the entire 3rd act. It became Benecio Del Toro's rendition of Taken for about half an hour, and then BAM here come's Emily again to whine about a guy killing someone's family when she's witnessed endless amounts of horrifying bloodshed for an hour and twenty minutes. She somehow went unhardened in that entire process. She never accepted reality and its horrors, and instead of joining in the fight she just got in its way.\n\nIt's still a good film. It just could have been so much more. I don't blame Blunt by the way, she was a fine actress in the film. The writing is to be questioned when you put such heavy emphasis on a character without explaining her properly. From the get-go they obscure the reasons behind her hire, making her more of a plot device than an actual character I should care about. But still they push her forward and I DO care about her because Blunt did a great job of interpreting her internal struggle between ethics and reality. \n\nYet they never cashed it in. She ends up being a character who constantly seems in too deep and incapable of handling things. It makes her appear weak and the ultimate message becomes unclear. Is the War on Drugs good? Bad? Are our politics with Mexico sound? Is this good for people or not?\n\nThose are profound questions this film had the potential to answer, and it simply passed on them all. With regards to cinematics, it's a beautiful movie that reminded me of Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now, as well as flashbacks from The Hurt Locker. It's gorgeous. But unlike those movies, it doesn't take a definitive stance on what the story really means. I walked away more confused than enlightened and I believe where this could have been art it became shallow and obtuse past the mid-way point. While there are some highlights, the plot just leaves glaring holes filled at awkward times.\n\nCheck it out, but don't wet the bed in excitement.",

It seemed that all of the main actors were on the same page as far as the movie should go. And portrayed their roles perfectly. All of the actors worked together like a well made Swiss watch. Denis Villenueve masterfully managed to capture the intensity and suspense of this mesmerizing thriller. The director cemented his name as one of the best if not the best thriller masters in Hollywood today.  I would rate it 18/20\nCinematography - Was really impressive, and manages to capture the audience from the first shot of the movie and never let go of the viewer. The lightning seems bleak, but that just adds to suspense of the movie. There were a lot of impressive shots, including the very well made aerial shots of the USA - Mexican border.  I would rate it 17/20\nWriting - A movie is as good as it's script. Well in this case it's marvelous. The movie delivers everything it promises and more. It manages to deliver the thrills and sense of intensity from the start. All through out the movie, viewers are encouraged to question every single character, because the line of good and bad in this movie is very thin.  20/20\nScore - The composer Johann Johannson manages to do a very good job. Score is done to perfection. Every bit of sound seems to fit the frames perfectly and just helps to add the thrills.    I would rate it 18/20\nActing - A give a very big A plus for all the actors in this movie. Like i mentioned before, everyone fitter the role pretty much perfectly with good casting. All of the actors performed very well, so it is very difficult to mention some in particular. It seemed like every actor added something personal to the role, that made them very memorable. The chemistry between actors was something special, every relationship between characters was really intensifying, and mesmerizing.      I would rate it 20/20\nNow for the MVP of the movie is: Jon Bernthal, who truly might have slipped under the radar. But his performance was both memorable and amazing. Even though he didn't have very much of a screen time, what he did with what he got, was really masterful. He deliver a bad cop, who does not give a bad impression and hides under a mask. His character is like a wolf, disguised himself as a sheep.\nIn Total i would rate this movie - 95/100. One of the best thrillers ever made, and one of the best last years movies.",

It had a solid premise, twist, intense scenes, score, and decent into darkness. It also has a powerful message to send about escalation and drug enforcement policy. What went wrong? I think the film relied too heavily on shock and drama to obscure from its shortcomings. The plot moved at a snail's pace for  3/4 of the film where little was explained or happened. Besides that it has one major problem. The lead character was insufferable. She was annoying, clueless, afraid, and amateur, despite this being her profession. Her treatment was also abysmal. She was used, mislead, and bullied by her teammates; threatened into submission. There are deliberate undertones of misogyny, and promotion of violence. Expected considering the subject matter and audience, though are no less disturbing to experience. As for it's realism. Something funny to know is that the CIA, Mexican Government, and town of Ju\u00e1rez all called bullshit and denounced the film, even getting it ban in several places, since violent and cartel related crime statistics have been steadily dropping for years thanks to successful DEA, FBI, CIA, Mexican Army and police efforts to quell the cartels. In many respects what is portrayed in the film is still very \"Hollywood\".",

It takes a look at the war that US law enforcement is waging against the Mexican drug cartels, and tries to make you question if the ends justify the means. The first thing that needs to be said is that this movie deserves every Oscar nomination it received. Between the spectacular look of the movie and the sound/score, they set a tone that played brilliantly into the story. As for the story itself, I had some issues with that. In the opening scene I was totally hooked. There were surprises, great acting, and spectacular effects. However when the plot started to get rolling and suddenly we find ourselves left in the dark (along with Emily Blunt) I was only slightly intrigued but largely frustrated. I had hopes that there was some huge underlying secret that might really make the movie great with a stunning twist in the end. But when everything is revealed I wasn't satisfied because none of it was all that shocking, in fact it was kind of along the lines of what I thought was going on from the very beginning. Perhaps the issue is that they spend so much time selling you on the mystique of Benicio del Toro's character that he would almost have to be an alien from Mars in order to live up to the intrigue they created. I think the acting was good, the action was good, and (as I said) the look and sound were amazing. I just wish Sicario had a more impressive or satisfying conclusion. In the end I was still identifying with Emily Blunt, and like her I could not find satisfaction in how things were handled. To be fair, though, it's a very affecting movie that I think might work better for others, it just fell short of greatness for me.",

While that may be the current state of affairs in the 'war on drugs' today, it's hardly inspiring to make an entire film based on that premise. Really it all feels like a long slow build-up to nothing at all. It's ultimately anti-climactic and disappointing, and as the credits roll, one is left feeling distinctly underwhelmed. I understand how critics would enjoy such a gritty and depressing movie, but I do not understand the high audience rating. And to call it as a \"thriller\" is a stretch to say the least. Less than one eighth of the film could be characterized as \"thrilling\". That's tantamount to describing the latest \"Die Hard\" as a foreign film because it features 15 minutes of Russian dialogue.

When tensions rise on the US-Mexico border, a task force is assembled, enlisting a passionate yet na\u00efve FBI agent (Emily Blunt) to aid in its efforts. The goals and actions of the task force represent a departure the young agent is not yet willing to make, yet feels inexplicably logical in an illogical world.\n\nWith Sicario, talented director Denis Villeneuve takes on the drug war in really an unprecedented way. Its' political overtones, realism, and cynicism is reminiscent of the great Traffic, yet without the overwrought indignation. It's a slow burn, with a methodical build up and a matter-a-fact way of examining the brutality and carnage that cartels engage in, without glossing over government complicity. Vilenueve pulls no punches, and succeeds in making a film that is both enthralling and cerebral. It has a point of view, yet the viewer has to make their own interpretations. Shades of gray abound, a laudable departure from a genre that otherwise can succumb to less nuanced stories.\n\nThe film's ensemble cast is second to none, featuring marvelous performances from all involved, including Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro. Toro, for his part, showed a depth I haven't before seen from him. The chemistry between the cast is palpable and the direction brings the best out of the actors, whose complex characterizations all bring a much needed wrinkle to a the story.\n\nToward the end, one would wish for more exploration of the film's major revelation, feeling a bit unsatisfying in the last act. Yet it still manages to bring something to the table that past genre pieces have not, a very real sense of hopelessness that, if never confronted, will never be defeated.\n\n4/5 Stars",

The colors, wide shots, i can't describe how pleasing was it to watch it. \n\nMy main complaint about the movie is Blunt's character. It was a constant moral battle for me to watch her. Sometimes i loved her, sometimes her strong moral compass pissed me off and i wished she understood what's happening, and then i loved her again for being so opinionated. That's the beauty of it, seeing such complex characters on screen, never knowing whether to love them or be annoyed. The acting both on Blunt's and of course on del Toro's parts is amazing.\n\nThe most important part though: this movie is scary. Seeing how much innocent people are affected by drug cartels running their towns and at the same time how used they are to it. Gun shots, missing people, dead family members are not treated as a tragedy anymore, it's a part of their daily life. And to think people still live like this in the world. It's terrifying.",

            "content": "Review: Sicario\nWell, it's here. Sicario was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, right up there with Spectre and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Now that I've seen it, I wouldn't dare call Sicario a disappointment, but I wouldn't label it as my favorite of the year. After Denis Villeneuve's underseen gem Prisoners back in 2013, I eagerly awaited his next major film (he made the limited-release film, Enemy, between then and now-I've yet to see it). The two films share the similarities of being intense, suspenseful and bleak, but where Prisoners featured limited venues and focused more on characters' emotions, Sicario is a globe-trotting film (between the US and Canada anyway) that focuses on characters' actions.\nEmily Blunt stars as Kate Macer, a young cop who's work in leading teams that hunt down kidnappers and victims hasn't gone unnoticed by the higher-ups. She has a loyal partner in Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya who gets the task of playing possibly the only likeable male character in the movie, and he does a great job). After an investigation goes wrong and two cops from her team end up killed, Kate is eager to find the men responsible. She is afforded this opportunity when a mysterious task force of mixed agencies asks her to join them in taking on a Mexican drug cartel they tell her is linked to the kidnappings she is investigating. She doesn't hesitate to volunteer, leaving Reggie behind at first, but when she realizes she can't trust the strange new men she is working with, she insists on her partner's presence. She has every reason not to trust them. Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) won't reveal what agency he works for. And he's a bit on the quirky side-he wears flip-flops. And his partner Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is even more mysterious-he doesn't talk much and it feels unlikely to both Kate and the audience that he works for any reputable agency. It doesn't take long observing their unusual and violent tactics for the normally by-the-book Kate to wonder what she's gotten herself into. The team conjures up a dangerous plan to follow a Cartel higher-up to the leader of the whole thing so they can both be taken down, hopefully putting a big dent in the criminal activities. There is also a side story involving a crooked cop with a heart played by Maximiliano Hernandez. This story feels very tacked-on throughout the movie and it isn't until the very last scene that you finally realize the point to it-but it still feels somewhat unnecessary.\nEvery actor in Sicario brings their A-game and does the best they can with what they've been given to work with. That's not to be overly mean to the script as it is an interesting story, but at times the dialogue seems very generic and some very important characters are often left with little to do. Blunt plays Kate much more feminine than her much tougher roles in Looper and Edge of Tomorrow would have you predicting, but she makes the character feel authentic and she carries the film well-that is until the filmmakers decide to lose her for some time to focus on Alejandro's agendas. This isn't easy on the audience because we're asked to accept him as a protagonist even though he is very violent and unlikeable. Del Toro plays the part well and practically owns the final act of the movie. It is clear Alejandro suffered some horrible tragedy in life-and I wish they would've included a flashback or two to some happier times for him so that we might find it easier to sympathise with him and understand his actions. Other good actors show up for small parts including Victor Garber as Kate's boss, Jon Bernthal as a character I won't reveal, and Jeffrey Donovan as a member of Matt's special task force.\nBehind the camera, master-cinematographer Roger Deakins works hard to make Sicario a unique visual experience. He's one of the best in the business (12 Academy Award nominations and still no win-Come on Oscar!) and proves himself once again here. Some of the natural skylines he captures are gorgeous and there is an amazing sequence where everything is seen through infrared and night-vision goggles-fans of the compound raid scene in Zero Dark Thirty will love this sequence. Editor Joe Walker makes sure the film doesn't drag too much. When things start to feel a bit slow, watch out-because something intense is about to happen. The score by Johann Johannsson is one of my favorites this year. Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Taylor Sheridan have made a film smart enough to please critics but mainstream enough to entertain audiences.\nSicario is a film about moral flexibility. We, the audience, are forced to recognize that sometimes good people do evil things because they they believe it is for the greater good and sometime bad people do bad things to protect those closest to them. Other than some lazy dialogue here or there, Sicario's weakest attribute may be what feels like a lack of purpose. While it does open audiences' eyes to the war zone certain parts of Mexico have become do to these cartels, I couldn't help but feel like \"That was good, but what was the point?\" when the credits rolled. Still Sicario Is an intense thriller that deserves to be seen. 8/10?",

            "content": "During an FBI SWAT raid of suspected kidnappers in Chandler, Arizona, idealistic agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), and their team discover dozens of corpses hidden within the walls of the house. While the team investigates the crime scene, an improvised explosive device in the backyard shed explodes, killing two officers. Afterwards, Kate's boss, Dave Jennings (Victor Garber), recommends her to Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a CIA Special Activities Division undercover officer and Department of Defense adviser leading a team of Delta Force operators searching for the men responsible, including cartel hitman Manuel D\u00edaz. Kate volunteers to join the team. On the plane to El Paso, Texas, Kate meets Matt's partner, Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro), and learns that they are going to Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, where they will extradite one of Diaz's top men, his brother Guillermo...\n\nDenis Villeneuve is back with yet another fantastic film after \"Prisoners\" and \"Enemy\" and his \"Sicario\" is a tour-de-force thriller that pushes the boundary of where justice and morality are no longer valid. We are driven straight into the depths of criminality and it\u00b4s not always clear who is the good guys and who is the bad guys. It all comes down to reaching results and not how you reach them. Blunt, Brolin and del Toro are simply magnificent and in the hands of Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins we are served an amazing dynamic piece of film that keeps your blood rushing for 121 minutes. The tension is high throughout the film even in more slowpaced scenes and as in \"Enemy\" Villeneuve works with industrial muffled weird sounds in the background that creates a dark and disturbing vibe that fits the film. Villeneuve shows a situation that is beyond salvation, while showing at the same time that life nevertheless continues no matter what happens in the shady parts of the world. The action is truly believable and you end up together with Blunt and Co while they are trying to understand the events that occur. The role of the observing Macer is by far one of Emily Blunt\u00b4s best performances to date. I love as well that Villeneuve isn\u00b4t afraid of keeping a distance to his actors and the dialogue like in one scene between Macer and Graver where the camera is several feet away. Great scene. Dan Jolin from Empire gave the film 5 stars, calling it \"a beautifully murky, hard-edged thriller. Quite simply, one of the best films of the year.\" And I can\u00b4t agree more. Trivia: While Benicio Del Toro's character is frequently silent in the movie, he initially had more lines. \"In the original script, the character explained his background several times to Kate,\" Del Toro says. \"And that gave me information about who this guy was, but it felt a little stiff to have someone you just met 15 minutes ago suddenly telling you what happened to him and who he is.\" Working with director Denis Villeneuve, Del Toro began cutting some of his dialogue to preserve the mystery of who his character is; Villeneuve estimates they cut 90 percent of what Del Toro was originally intended to say by screenwriter Taylor Sheridan. Like Del Toro, Villeneuve saw power in stripping the character down to a brooding silence, stating that dialogue belongs to plays and \"movies are about movement, character, and presence, and Benicio had all that.\"",

The action is exciting, but reserved, and absolutely thrilling. I understand why it's been placed on so many top 10 lists. I think it's biggest flaw is pacing.

            "content": "An excellent movie that obviously benefits from some fantastic performances from Benicio Del Toro, realistically, this might be one of his best and Emily Blunt.  Though, honestly, I will say that this is the type of movie that doesn't really reveal all its cards until the last act.  That makes watching the film, not necessarily difficult, require a little more patience from some of those in the audience.  This approach, however, I think really adds to the movie, because you're just as much in the dark Emily Blunt's character is.  You learn things as she learns them and not a moment before.  The character work in the film is top-notch as Kate, Blunt's character, is doing her damnedest to try to do things by the book as everyone around her goes about doing things the way they want to and the way that would get the desired result, which is to bring Alarcon down.  Kate, and Alejandro points this out in the ending of the film, is trying to traverse a world of wolves without the necessary skill set to do so.  Not to say that she is a sheep among the wolves, but she is far too idealistic for the type of tasks that the people she's working with are doing.  In fact, realistically speaking, Kate is essentially useless to the task these agents are trying to accomplish.  I don't mean ineffectual, like Kurt Russell's character in Big Trouble in Little China, I just mean that her contributions, as sound and as smart as they may be, will never be considered by the team, because she is there simply so they can carry out their operation, nothing more.  And I think that's one of the things this film does so well.  It gives you this character, that's supposed to be the moral compass of the film, the only person who, seemingly, wants to do things the way they should be done and she, even with all her efforts, is unable to change the way things were done.  It wasn't a lack of trying, it was willful ignorance from those who are higher up above her.  She, to them, is just a small pawn in a clearly larger game.  So I thought that was a a really interesting choice to take the character and one that, again, adds to the movie tremendously.  As mentioned, the acting is pretty fantastic.  Benicio Del Toro is quietly menacing in this film.  He doesn't have to show a lot of emotion or communicate a lot, but you know that this man has seem some shit and would probably kill his own mother if he felt that she was getting in the way of his progress.  It's also interesting seeing his character arc and witnessing how he ends up in the movie and what really was haunting this man for all this time.  As mentioned, Emily Blunt is also excellent as well, and her character, from a narrative standpoint, is probably the most interesting in the film as she slowly realizes what she actually adds to this mission.  So, yes, this is an excellent film, but one that's just not gonna show all its cards right off the bat.  That makes it more rewarding to watch as a viewer.  I'd highly recommend this, might be one of my favorites of last year.",

I feel like there are times where first time screenwriter Taylor Sheridan falters, such as the scene about an hour in where we first get to engage with the character of Kate Macy as she walks into a bar. After watching the film for an hour and having it make no attempts to get me to connect to this character, rather simply using her as a vessel for the audience (which I'm fine with) when she finally does walk into a bar and show her human side it completely jarred with what I was expecting to happen. Nevertheless, this sequence is used to propel the plot forwards at the same time and so this complaint quickly disappeared as I was watching. What the film gives us is a timely message about large, faceless branches of government doing what they want and answering to nobody, told through the eyes of a few key characters that it switches between at certain points. Typically beautiful visuals from Deakins, characters are created through the performances (del Toro being very good at this) rather than expository dialogue, haunting score, and a screenplay that accomplishes what it wants with very little dead weight.",

Villeneuve is one of the best directors of today and has a very clear stamp on how he does movies.

It mostly plays like a lesser Hurt Locker/Zero Dark Thirty and a less shaky Paul Greengrass film, and Villeneuve knows when and how to perfectly ratchet up the suspense on the film's explosions of violence. Benecio Del Toro has shades of Javier Bardem's character in No Country for Old Men but is somehow more terrifying, even given his hokey, flimsy backstory that feels like it never evolved after the script's first draft. The script is the main issue here. The subject matter is fascinating, and I just can't help feeling that this could have been an outstanding film were the characters given the requisite amount of depth to make you care what happens to them and the script stripped of the action/revenge/vigilante tropes that cheapens the film.",

            "content": "I had high hopes for this film which is winning awards and getting some\nOscar buzz. The cast is amazing and the storyline is very interesting.\nHowever, there are some very gross flaws in the direction and\ncharacters in the film that caused me to give it a 7 (maybe even a 6)\nout of 10. The handful of great moments of intensity make it worth a 7,\nbut this is not a best picture nominee. Without giving away any\nspoilers, I can say the following:\nTHE BAD:\n * Emily Blunt character does (or fails to do) what you expect she would. She fails to ask questions or show some basic skills you would expect for someone in her position.\n* She is not believable in her professional or personal behavior. We\ndon't really get her. Yes, she's conflicted, but there are 4-5 times\nwhere it makes no sense. \n* The story gets confusing and convoluted. Who are they going after and how and why and how does it all work out.\nBeyond implausible, it's like they edited 50% of the film away and left\nus with some gaping holes. \n* Governmental agencies are jumbled and confusing to an absurd level. \n* A few action scenes are absurd. \n* Random locations with random people where you do not know who they are nor why they are there.\n\nWhat I love about feature films in theaters is the level of realism,\nacting and storytelling is generally FAR superior to any TV show or\nmovie. In this case, the director handles the character development and\naction scenes more like a TV movie. The cave scene being the most\nabsurd and the main character (Emily Blunt) feeling like a poorly\nwritten TV character. \n\nBenicio and Josh Brolin have their moments of greatness, but their\ncharacters are too gruff to care much about them. There is\nanother storyline about a Mexican police officer that is also poorly\ndeveloped. \n\nTHE GOOD: You will feel like you understand the complexity of the\nMexico-US drug crisis. For those who feel doing illegal drugs does not\nharm anyone, this movie will give you a clear picture of the dangers to\nsociety and the corruption that exists along the border. Clearly, we\nhave major issues that must be addressed.",

Someone who's too forthright and honest to fully comprehend a world without rules. I love how even some of the smaller bad guys are not even shown as conflicted and human instead of monstrous. But what I like best of all is the presentation of a wider conflict as many of the characters and groups peripheral to the main characters have lives and wits of their own and do not exist solely for the main characters to show up. It reminds me of Heat in a great many ways, and is one of the only movies I could call a worthy successor to that (which is my favorite crime film).",

It is painfully predictable at the best of times, seriously, the underlying 'twist' was about as transparent as transparent can be. Emily Blunt also appears to be in my opinion a completely superfluous character. Considering she is supposedly the lead role in the film. It is really quite difficult to see the point in her actually being present most of the time as all she seems to do is cry, a lot. From what i can work out she is only there to constantly remind us that what is going on is most defiantly bad. Seriously. And as for thrilling, it's a joke. I can honestly say there wasn't a single moment I was even close to the edge of my seat, quite the opposite in fact, at one point struggled to actually stay conscious. This may be due to the poor character development throughout the entire film all of whom have the most minimal backstories I have come across in recent memory. Meaning I felt literally nothing for them throughout and frankly could not give a toss what happened to them or not. The only character I felt any sort of connection with was the father, who, of course, predictably died.  I would say this is a spoiler but the entire movie is so transparent I don't feel this would be justified.\n\nThe only saving grace is the excellent work done from the films camera crew which helps, as at least it gives stunning scenery shots to distract from the rest of the content.\nThoroughly disappointed. There is a absolute wealth of great quality films out at the moment. The Martian, The Revenant, The Big Short to name but a few. Go and watch one of those instead and don't bother with this!",

The shots of Juarez, the open skies and other scenery were breathtaking.  The tension was built up excellently and there were many suspenseful moments, particularly that traffic scene. The action was handled really well in between the slower parts of the movie. The acting was all around great, but the character development was lacking. Benicio Del Toro easily stole this movie and was the most interesting character by far. Emily Blunt did a good job but I wasn't a fan of her character. She didn't really develop much and was kind of bland. Josh Brolin did a great job of playing a confident, gum-chewing asshole. This is where this movie fell pretty short of Prisoners for me. I was so invested in multiple characters in that movie and in its story. The story in this film is rather passable. Not bad, but nothing special or that memorable. It was a good look at the debatably immoral, but necessary means needed to fight the War on Drugs and the impact it has on the inhabitants in Mexico. The last scene of the movie really stood out to me and made me feel such sadness for the Mexicans living among such violence.

We follow Emily Blunt's character who is not used to this kind of field work, but the team she works for interested me much more. \"Sicario\" benefits from a very solid script, a tension-filled story, and terrific performances. I do think this film is slightly overrated, but it's concept is worth the price of admission alone. In the end, I really enjoyed watching this film.

The film was gritty, it was dirty and it was tense.\nFirstly the movie is visually stunning, the cinematography is exceptional and Denis Villeneuve showcases his directorial talents  once again after Prisoners and Enemy is showing he can consistently created well directed and captivating movies.\nThe performances in the movie are also magnificent Emily Blunt delivers another terrific performance and is fast becoming the best actress within the action genre after her tremendous performance in Edge of Tomorrow. Her character is the person that we see the movie trough and is probably the only morally stable person in the whole film, and this gives her a feeling of vulnerability because although she can physically handle her self, unlike the other law enforcement officers she is too idealistic and doesn't always have what it takes to get the job done. But definitely the best performance and most intriguing character in the movie was Benicio Del Toro who gives a fabulous performance as Alejandro, he is a mysterious character who's motives are unclear until the end and you never really know who's side he is on. \nThe only minor fault with this movie is that its story and at times very little interesting is happening. Without the tremendous performances and direction the film could have fallen flat on its face but they elevate it from just being another standard drug bust movie to one of the best films of 2015.",

I feel like there are times where first time screenwriter Taylor Sheridan falters, such as the scene about an hour in where we first get to engage with the character of Kate Macy as she walks into a bar. After watching the film for an hour and having it make no attempts to get me to connect to this character, rather simply using her as a vessel for the audience (which I'm fine with) when she finally does walk into a bar and show her human side it completely jarred with what I was expecting to happen. Nevertheless, this sequence is used to propel the plot forwards at the same time and so this complaint quickly disappeared as I was watching. What the film gives us is a timely message about large, faceless branches of government doing what they want and answering to nobody, told through the eyes of a few key characters that it switches between at certain points. Typically beautiful visuals from Deakins, characters are created through the performances (del Toro being very good at this) rather than expository dialogue, haunting score, and a screenplay that accomplishes what it wants with very little dead weight.",

With the comparison to Zero Dark Thirty also comes the disappointment. Jessica Chastain's character was tough, resilient and killer at heart. Emily Blunt's character is described perfectly and entirely ironically by Benecio Del Toro when he tells her that she will not survive because she is not a wolf in a land of wolves. Ironically again, her acting only shines when she is called upon to play scared little girl, her terror matched only by the petulance of her character. Not only does her fragility underscore the strength of female characters but some of the scenes like in the tunnel, where a supposedly hardened FBI door kicker flinches at gunfire, are absolutely ridiculous.

            "content": "\"In Mexico SICARIO means HITMAN\"\n\n'Sicario' is an Action Thriller / Crime Drama that follows an FBI agent who gets thrown into a war against the drug cartels operating along the border of the US and Mexico. Apart from the stellar cast leading the film, i was most excited to see this film because of it being directed by Denis Villenueve. For those of you who don't know, he directed 2013's 'Prisoners' and 2014's 'Enemy', both are incredibly fantastic films that were directed to near perfection and you should definitely check out. This was still a fantastically directed film by Villenueve, but compared to those films i just mentioned, this one has many other flaws that didn't make it quite as intense as i hoped it would be from seeing the trailers. If you are looking for a fast paced, high octane action thriller, this is not it. Much like his previous films, this is a very character driven story where the film at times is carried on the backs of the amazing performances by Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro. Despite these praises, there are elements of the film that i didn't enjoy and harmed my overall experience with the film. \n\nThe film started off very promising, it showed off some some of the thriller elements whilst also introducing our characters and the main overall plot of the film which was pretty meh up until the last third of the film. I was initially intrigued by what was going on and wanted to find out more about what is really going on behind the scenes, especially with Del Toro's character. But for almost the entire second act of the film, i found myself checking my phone a few times because it dragged on and on and didn't look to be ending any time soon. It had some short moments that were quite interesting in terms of character development and getting me a little more interested in the plot. But overall, the second act wasn't all that compelling to watch like the rest of the film was. I feel like they tried to do a lot to set up the finale, and just the way it was structured became an issue for me. A lot of scenes didn't quite make sense and took me out of it a bit. It all ran at a fairly slow pace which i was expecting but there were no dramatic or intense tones to get me engaged with what was going on, apart from one or two moments. A lot of this middle section relied purely on the performances of Blunt, Brolin, and Del Toro, and even though they were fantastic it wasn't enough to make me enjoy this section. It's hard to explain, but just a lot of the writing in this section looks and sounds good on paper, but the execution wasn't great. \n\nThat being said, the last 30 minutes of this movie....... SPECTACULAR. Not going to give anything away but shit hits the fan from a storytelling standpoint, a character standpoint and an action thriller standpoint and this really saved the film for me. All of the little bits and pieces that were set up throughout the film come full circle and you realise a lot of things that maybe didn't make sense earlier make total sense now, such as 'why is the film even called Sicario?....... **You know what, stuff this, i'm gonna revoke some of the things i have mentioned so far MID REVIEW but not edit it out, because thinking about the end, and then thinking about what happened earlier is making me realise that this film was a lot smarter and well crafted than i thought it was 5 minutes ago. I obviously can't talk about any of the things i am thinking about, but this is probably going to make me watch it again like i did with 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy', and i reckon i might enjoy it more the second time, only time will tell. \n\nBut as i mentioned before, the performances of Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro were all absolutely fantastic. I am not necessarily surprised because they are all incredible actors but in this film when they came together no-one took anything away from the others' performances. One did stand out well above the others but it didn't make me love the other performances less, if anything each performance added to the others. There is also quite a bit of talent in the supporting roles but due to the scope of these three large actors always commanding the screen they will most likely go largely unnoticed. \n\nIn the end, Sicario is a film that definitely not everyone will appreciate. It is more than an action thriller and incorporates great amounts of drama, and plenty of intense moments. The second act of the film whilst watching it did really hurt my enjoyment of the film in the moment, but as i mentioned, it didn't bother me nearly as much and i actually now praise some of the decisions they made. If you like Villenueve's previous films this one is not quite up to par but you can still see a lot of his signature all over this film and that is what i enjoyed about it. - 7.2",

Starring Emily Blunt, Bencicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin, the movie sends off Kate, an FBI agent, to solve who's behind this bombing attack revolving around drug cartels that occurred in Pheonix. They travel to Juarez, Mexico to try to figure out who's behind these drug cartels. I liked a lot of things about Sicario, but I also have many issues. The action scenes are great. So smooth and efficient. Every scene was tense and suspenseful and made the movie better to watch. But there weren't many of them. When the action was going on, the movie was more intense and exciting. But when the not so interesting dialogue was on screen, I wanted more action and tense scenes. It just takes you away from the film. On a performance standpoint, I felt Blunt was decent but it was overshadowed by Del Toro. He really is Oscar deserving in this film. He made his character more dirty, cruel, and electrified the movie. One of the highlights in Sicario was how beautifully shot it was. The cinematography in the film is magnificent with stellar camera work that is eye candy. Definitely an Oscar contender. My biggest flaw in Sicario is the way the story was told. There were many scenes in which characters on screen were explaining the next plot point but it just wasn't clear enough. It just  took awhile for certain points to come across and become understood. The pace was just too uneven. But overall Sicario is a decent film. I think if the story wasn't so tangled and things were better explained with more it could've made the movie a lot better. Nonetheless Sicario still gives entertaining enough action scenes along side excellent cinematography and Del Toros performance to enjoy.",

The film did not arrive with the same pomp as \"The Martian\" (which opened the same weekend), but it left an equally large impression on the critics.  It is dark, gritty, and the only thing more disturbing than the imagery of cadavers hanging in the streets is the idea that the residents of Juarez have accepted this atmosphere as a part of daily life.  The story seems a bit overdramatic but a little research shows this portrayal to be chillingly accurate.  Moreover, the main reason that Juarez has descended from its rank as the most violent city in the world is because one drug cartel has defeated its rivals.  One would hope that the police and military had brought order to the area, but that is simply not the case.  Director Denis Villeneuve has made a bold statement about the government corruption and drug violence that rule this area.  Most of the critical praise surrounding \"Sicario\" has involved the acting.  Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro turn in impressive performances through subtle but powerful moments.  I could see either of them receiving an Oscar nomination but neither performance is good enough to win.  Josh Brolin also gives the high-caliber performance that we expect from him.  I do feel that the film moves a bit too slow, especially after a riveting opening sequence, but the pace gives you a chance to reflect on the unfortunate circumstance of the area.  The film focuses on situational development more than character development so that, in the end, you feel a greater attachment to the story than the characters within.  \"Sicario\" accomplishes its goal of bringing awareness to the drug violence in Mexico through strong acting performances and a story that is so unbelievable that you have to believe it.",

The script is sensible, but it could have had more story. The acting is perfect for the script, Emily Blunt delivers terrific emotion in scenes where she speaks nothing at all.

Johan Johannson's ominous score adds to the continual overhanging sense of pointlessness of this war. \nBut it's the trio of performances that really give Sicario its integrity. Brolin and Del Toro are both excellent, displaying the varying elusive and ambiguous qualities of their respective characters with great depth. But its Blunt's in-over-her-head FBI recruit who is the heart and soul of this film; its the two qualities completely redundant and wasted in the cyclical, cynical hopelessness this war weighs down on those with any humanity.\nSo, not an uplifting film by any stretch, but a tensely accurate thriller that reminds us all that some wars are unwinnable.",

More than that, it's nearly a masterpiece of sustained and unbearable tension, the sort of movie that gets the audience to feel that something truly awful could erupt at any moment.  It's a grim and unflinching film, one that is unafraid to make the audience witness some very intense and unpleasant realities about confronting the drug cartels along the border.  As the lead, Emily Blunt is incredible, delivering a performance full of depth that completely sells this by-the-book character's realization of the gravity of the situation she finds herself in; this is Blunt's finest hour, and it is one of the standout performances of the year.  She's equally matched by Benicio Del Toro's subtle and enigmatic turn; it's not a showy role, in the traditional sense, because Del Toro plays everything incredibly close to the vest, and he makes what could have been a one-note character into the page into a dynamic and magnetic presence.  Roger Deakins' cinematography is fairly stripped down, in contrast to his usually painterly style, but his photography here matches the harshness of the subject matter perfectly (and still finds a way to include some legitimately beautiful compositions, to be sure).  If one wanted to nitpick, the plot specifics are - at times - a bit murky, but this appears to be by design.  With this, PRISONERS, and ENEMY, Villeneuve has firmly established himself as one of the best thriller directors working today, and while it might be too downbeat for some to stomach, SICARIO is an engrossing and frightening movie, and an experience that won't be easy to shake.",

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve may just be the most exciting and original film maker working in Hollywood currently, he recent psyche crushing thrillers have been a marvel to behold, if not ever so slightly flawed in the smallest of places. Sicario is his latest release before bringing the Blade Runner sequel to the big screen, and although many hardcore fans wait with bated breath, Sicario can act as a solid piece of entertainment to give them some confidence. Going bolder than ever before, Sicario follows the growing turmoil between the border of USA and Mexico, with cartel's massacring all walks of life for money, boredom or drugs. Presented with an opening to find the man in charge of such travesty, a covert government task force enlist the help of a by the books FBI agent, which she is all too happy to comply with, until she uncovers the corrupt and game changing mentality such a force need in order to succeed. From the moment Roger Deakins glorious cinematography lights up the screen and the pounding score breaks in, you instantly know your in for something thrilling and disgusting and Sicario doesnt let you down. The film continually throws you off guard by playing up a typical genre movie, only to snatch your expectations from underneath you and force you to endure a different breed of film. The performances in this film are stunning, Emily Blunt is beyond wonderful as Kate, our protagonist, Josh Brolin does what he does and to great effect, Benecio Del Toro almost steals the show and Jon Berenthal shows up to be an asshole for a brief amount of time. Sicario deals with some horrendous themes and subject matter, so having the cast downplay their performances really allows the grit of the piece to come through, especially when we question the force's tactics only to have them explain what needs to be done to win this war. It's harrowing and it manages to cause a range of emotions from disgust to anger, paranoia to fear and this is what sets Sicario apart from its competition, the film will have you on a razor blade throughout its 2 hour run time, managing to craft some of the most intense sequences you can imagine from the most unlikely of places, without spoiling anything, a traffic jam at the Mexican border will have you reaching for the valium. Its a wonderfully shot and excellently conceptualized thriller which plays the long game, rather than place all its eggs in one basket. Sicario's weakness is sadly its rock solid body armour, the film is so bleak and dank, so full of double crossing and back stabbing, its pretty hard to fully connect with. There are points during Sicario you will either feel lost or have an odd sense of deflation, quite possibly from being on edge constantly, and although if it were intentional this feeling would be acceptable, it happens all too often and for no good reason. Luckily Villeneauve bookends these moments with moments so shocking and pungent it almost makes up for it, almost. Sicario isnt perfect, but its stunning, gripping and darker than oil, an intense ride that will alienate some but further cements a director who may just be about to move up to another level entirely.",

            "content": "I can confidently say that 'Sicario' is one of the best movies of 2015. This movie exposes the bitter reality we desperately tried to hide, and by doing so, it makes us question about the fundamental values we have taken granted, so far.\n\n  The most remarkable and charming point of 'Sicario' is it's complicated characters. There are neither perfect heroes nor utter villains in the movie. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, and we, the audiences have much trouble in separating the sheep from the goats. \n\n There are several critical issues that the movie requires the audiences to think about. The first one is about the law and the justice. Matt is very competent CIA agent, at least in the war against the drug. He frequently breaks the law, and sometimes, even makes us to question whether his acts are justifiable, but ironically these are the main constituents of his ability. In some sense, he is the most dangerous character in this movie. As the movie progresses, we are somewhat persuaded by him, and begin to think that maybe sometimes, to root out the great evil like the drug, it is allowable to cross a line. Like 'for the greater good' thing. However, is it? Who is entitled to allow such violence of law and injustice? \n Kate is the complete opposite of Matt. She is faithful, righteous, and principled FBI agent. She is qualified for the typical protagonist, and we can say she was a good police officer in Phoenix where the rule of law still existed. However, ironically, in this fierce war against the drug, she is helpless and even incompetent because of her faith and morality. I wonder whether she is a 'good' police to deal with the drug problem, because she could not solve anything. This irony itself is what the movie requires us to think about the law. Law is the basic rule which we, by ourselves, made to live on the straight. However, if the law is helpless and incompetent to eradicate the evil and corruption of people, then, where is the place for the law? What is the meaning of the law? \n Alejandro is the most complicated character who hides so many secrets. He helps Kate in critical moments. On the other hand, he ruthlessly killed the innocent woman and children for his personal revenge. He was originally a prosecutor, which means that he knows the law, and understands the very meaning of justice and morality. However, the extreme experience made him to do such cold-blooded thing. Can we judge him, and criticize him whose wife's head was cut off, and whose daughters were thrown in hydrochloric acid? To make our society healthy, we must think that even so, this behavior is unjustifiable. However, in the bottom of my heart, I am not sure. Then, what is justice?\n\n Second one is about the evil. To be precise, the banality of evil. From the beginning of the movie, it intermittently shows Silvio's everyday life with his son, right after Kate's life in work or home. At first, I thought these scenes are meaningless, but now I understand the meaning of them. In my opinion, this character, Silvio represents the banality of evil. Silvio is an ordinary man, diligent police officer, and good father who cares about his son very much. On the other hand, he works for the cartel, and delivers drugs which destroys millions of families. That is, he is also the part of the evil that should be eradicated. This is the essence of evil. Not every bad guy looks like a monster. He or she is usually among our neighborhood, and can be good mother or father for their children, and outside home, destroys millions of families. No one is born evil, and looks like devil. No one is designated to be evil.\n\n 'Sicario' is the movie that sets an extreme condition and require the audience to continuously question about the most basic rule and faith of our society. It does not give answers to these questions. Perhaps, no one can. I believe finding an answer is an obligation of all of us 'who lives in the lands of the wolves'\n\n I'd like to finish this plain review with the quote from 'Mad Max : Fury road', another fabulous movie of 2015 :\n \"Where must we go, we who wander this wasteland, in search of our better selves - the First Man\"",

The sum of the movies parts don't equal something that memorable or even creative. It feels like the story builds all this anticipation and by the time it's over you feel like nothing happened. Take the Cohen Brothers classic \"No Country For Old Men\" (also starring Josh Brolin) the film is based on similar subject matter, it moves at a slow pace at times but by the end of the film you are left with so many deep and memorable scenes to draw from. I would be let down by every movie I see if I held it to the standard of \"NCFOM\", but I do expect the film to at least give me a little to work with.

            "content": "Sicario is a bit of a tough movie to watch because it seems like the producer wants to desensitize the audience when it comes to murder and humanity. The fact that there are bodies hidden in the walls and hung across the tunnels in Mexico and Kate's lacking facial expression when she sees these atrocities shows that mutilated dead bodies are somewhat normal. This movie relates to the movie, Border Town, because of the misrepresentation of Mexico. Even though drug cartels exist, it seems like producers make these type of films to highlight the negative aspects of the country. City officials of Juarez even stated that this movie was depicting the city in a bad light. They also stated that criminal activities have declined since the movie has been made, so it appears that the producer wants to milk the criminal activity in Mexico as much as he can in order to make a masterpiece of a movie. \nAlthough one of the themes in the movie tries to portray the glorified murders in Mexico, an interesting theme in the movie is how they assigned a female to play the part of an FBI agent. Just like in the movie, Border Town\u00b8 when Jennifer Lopez's character was assigned to play the lead role in solving or documenting a murder case, Kate, the FBI agent, is seen taking a stand and trying to figure out how to solve the case even after she was told that she wasn't needed anymore. Kate relates to Jennifer Lopez's character in Border Town after her boss decides not to use her information because he wants to sell out. These female characters are often assigned important roles in order to be demoted into the character that is no longer needed. This is borderline sexist because movies like this seem to be allowing the female characters to get a taste of being superior and to be considered as one of the guys when in reality they are just being used by the white men to gain access to the valuables. \nThis movie proves itself to be sexist as well as devaluation of humanity because of the displays of dead bodies everywhere and that one female character who is considered to be of no use after the white men obtain what was needed. This movie appears to be insensitive to the people living in Juarez because they are communicating to the audience that this is not a safe place to visit or be. Sicario can influence a viewer to believe that the city of Juarez is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.",

This time, Villeneuve takes on America's war on drugs. From start to finish, Sicario is a tension filled spectacle. If ever think the film will ever ease up, don't hold your breath. \nSicario follows a FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams agent Kate Macer, played by Emily Blunt. During a drug raid, a bomb goes off killing two fellow officers. She meets Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a Department of Defense adviser who is setting up a team to capture those responsible. Kate is offered a spot, which she accepts. She soon meets Matt's mysterious partner, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Kate begins to discover Matt's and Alejandro's unorthodox and illegal procedures. \nSicario is dark and gripping tale held together by a strong direction, screenplay, and acting. Emily Blunt gives an outstanding performance that should earn her an Oscar nomination. Much like the audience, Kate is in the dark about Matt's and Alejandro's agenda. As the film progresses, she is given more light on their agenda, but is morally conflicted of how they are going about it. She wants to capture this drug lord, but at what cost? One of Blunt's strongest aspects of her performance is her facial expressions. It highlights her confusion and frustration with the situation. \nBrolin is stellar as the cocky team leader. Matt's one and only goal is to take down this drug lord in any way he can. He doesn't lose sleep about the way he goes about it, it's just business. The most mysterious character is Alejandro. Del Toro gives bone chilling performance. It is also his most captivating performance since Traffic. Maybe films about illegal drug trade is his calling. \nThe unsettling direction by Villeneuve is brilliantly captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins. Deakins uses actual darkness to capitalize on the film's gritty nature. If I had to give one warning about Sicario is that there is no shining light at the end of the tunnel. The film does not give the viewer anything or anyone to hold on to. Sicario commits in being dark. You feel like you have to cleanse yourself afterwards. But while you are watching the film, you will be glued. Sicario is one of the most captivating films of the year.",

            "content": "An average film. Nothing particularly gripping, just very violent. It seems as though some of the violence depicted is based on the real life events/violence going on in Mexico. However, a lot of the plot seems rather unrealistic. For example, I thought Emily Blunt's character's relationship with the Swat team should have panned out differently because of both her attitude, voiced opposition to the unruly behaviour/operations of the Swat team and also when she goes off on her own during a live operation. You would have expected some harm to come to her. The other thing I did not get was how Emily's character and that of her partner who seem to be both in position through political correctness rather than ability, no matter how much the film tries to say otherwise, are able to just slot into the Swat team's operations. Just not realistic at all, almost stupid. A bit like joining the Navy Seals for an operation with no training at all. Then Del Torro fails to deal with Emily Blunt's character in the manner consistent with his character. Similarly, the last scene involving Del Torro and the Drug Lord is rather silly to say the least. Hasn't the director seen Scarface. In short, there are some good parts to the film and some ridiculous, almost lazy parts that the director could have sorted out if he had a bit more balls. Scorcessee would have made a classic out of this. It was begging for it.",

My only small gripe is maybe the emptiness feeling and a sense of satisfaction or resolution you would expect, but that might just be my own preference here. Emily blunt although serves a certain purpose for the film I felt a bit underutilized here and could have been a much more substancial character for the overall plot but it doesn't take away from her great performance. highly recommended, one of the best of the year.",

Filled with an unrelenting tension and suspense (It's a film that turns rolling down your car window into a tension filled event). It's almost a dark horror film. \n\nIt exists in a grey area. Nobody is good (Except for Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya, who plays her buddy), but nobody is really bad either. Most are just grey, or bordering on bad. \n\nIt's expertly shot, with cinematography by Roger Deacons. It deserves an Oscar nod/win for that alone. \n\nEmily Blunt has a flawless American accent and is beautiful in a normal, everyday way. She is our eyes into the film and she acts as our moral compass. \n\nBenicio Del Toro is what I like to call The Dark Angel of the film. Both he and Blunt deserve Oscar nods, him especially. He's a mysterious but very likable character and it is Blunt and him that are our main characters. \n\nDaniel Kaluuya is also fantastic. \n\nThe opening scene is one of the best scenes in film this year. It's fantastic and gripping. \n\nSicario is certainly a tough watch, and it's almost a downer of a film (Really, not a happy film....but what were you expecting?) but I applaud it for handling it's subject matter in an adult, mature way.",

Meaning hitman in Mexico, Sicario tells the story of three lawmen, hit-men, soldiers and consciences working their way through the streets of morality and legality in an effort to put a stop to the war on drugs. Emily Blunt plays the lawmen and conscience of the film, with Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro playing smoke and mirrors on the streets of Juarez wearing masks of lawmen and soldiers in order to regain control over the underground drug trafficking that has filtered over the border.\n\nFrom the first scene Sicario comes out of the gate swinging, jostling your senses with a gorgeously timed house raid that plays out some thematic elements of action and horror that quickly let you know you aren't in for a singular note in this crescendo of movie making magic. After witnessing a few dozen bodies piled in between the walls of a suburban home in Arizona, we're quickly taken over the border, accompanied by Johann Johannsson's thumping drone and neo-classical score that gets your heart rate beating and demonstrates an amazing control over suspense. Not a stranger to crafting a story out of a simple notion, with Prisoners telling the tale of a family dealing with the kidnapping of their daughter, Denis Villeneuve manages to layer his film with enough tension, gritty action and dimly lit atmosphere that he makes setting a masterwork seem obvious.\n\nRead more at www.reelbrew.tumblr.com",

Kate is a strong woman on the outside, vulnerable for been alone and also divorced, it's also supporter of ethics and respect in the force, one of her biggest enemies in this war against corruption. \n\nArriving to el Paso, Texas in a orchestrated operation lead by Matt Graver, Kate meet with Alejandro Gallic (Benicio del Toro) an advisor who seems to have ties with enemy.

It's dark in tone and sometimes just in the screen, as well as gritty and even a tad gruesome in the first act. Emily Blunt does well even though I didn't care for her character in the film. Benecio Del Toro steals the movie in my opinion. Brolin is good in the film too as he adds some humor. Have to mention Victor Garber because I think he gets overlooked and for his short appearances it lends to the movie.\n\nThis movie is actually pretty damn good and close to great. It has some intense scenes and lots of subtleties. Del Toro is like the subtlety God in this film and pulls it off nicely. I honestly believe that if Del Toro is not in this movie then it would suffer severely. Sicario starts out following our lead (Blunt) and somewhere in the second act it starts following (Del Toro) all the way to the end and circles back to (Blunt) with a nice finish - albeit probably not the finish you're looking for either.\n\nI have favorite scenes for each act in the film and would assume that you will as well. Is you're thinking that this movie is all about drugs and drug cartels, then you're wrong as it is about much more than that. If fact, there are little situations about drugs and you might see them a couple times at most. This film is actually about much more larger aspects than just simple drug running. Emily Blunt's character is an emotional wreck of some sorts and brings the movie down a bit for me, which is why I rated \"Sicario\" at a 3.5/5. If here character was different or not so much of a drag - then I rate it 4/5.\n\nI highly recommend this movie and it is definitely re-watchable. I've seen it twice so far.\n\nLet me know what you think after you watch it. As always, I would never to NOT or DON'T watch a movie as I want you to watch every movie as I do.

Sheds light on what's really going on over the border and the damage America's illicit drug use is having on those communities, but make sure you watch this with a cup of coffee....or a red bull.",

            "content": "\"You will not survive here. You are not a wolf, and this is a land of wolves now.\"\n\nIt's been over a month now since I've seen this film and it has stuck with me in a way few films have this year. Denis Villeneuve is a talented director who knows how to build the right atmosphere for his movies. Sicario is all about tone and atmosphere. We've seen the premise of this film done to death, but somehow Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan manage to tell a familiar story in a very unique way. The success of Sicario isn't that it has a unique premise or a fantastic twist, but that it manages to tell a familiar story in such a captivating way with some of the best performances of the year. Sicario will be included in my list of the best films of 2015 without a doubt, and it is a must see for movie fans around the globe. Emily Blunt continues to expand her acting career with another brilliant performance although its Benicio de Toro who will get all the accolades for getting the stronger dramatic material to work with.\n\nThe film has the best opening sequence by far in a movie released this year as we are introduced to Emily Blunt's character, Kate Macer, who is leading a SWAT team across an Arizona desert and into a house where they suspect to find one of the Mexican cartel leaders, but end up finding much more than what they bargained for. Kate is a tough DEA agent who is determined to bring down the Mexican cartel. Once they arrive back at the station she is introduced to Josh Brolin's Matt Graver, a superior who wants her assistance in catching the cartel leader who was responsible for the events that unfolded at the house. Graver has a suave persona, he may be in charge of the operation but he seems laid back with his flip flops and cargo pants. His right hand man is much more silent and mysterious. It's Benicio del Toro's Alejandro, who certainly seems menacing and is hiding something underneath his calmed demeanor. He is evidently a man who has seen and experienced a lot of things in life. Kate accepts the mission despite not being fully informed of what she must do and she becomes a surrogate for the audience as she tries to understand what these men are up to just as we do. Villeneuve keeps the audience hooked and engaged while taking us through the Mexican border an back again with some magnificent cinematography from Roger Deakins. Sicario is a brilliant film that maintains the tension throughout its entire runtime. My only complaint is that the second half isn't as strong as the first.\n\nSicario is a film that should receive several nominations come Award time and I can't see how Del Toro won't be nominated for his superb supporting performance here. Although I must say that Brolin and Blunt are equally deserving for their work. Blunt is much more subtle in her approach as she has to adapt to this masculine dominated world and is constantly left in the loop of things. Brolin plays a character that he could play in his sleep with his suave and cool exterior, but he does it so well that it's hard not to sympathize with him. Del Toro is menacing and his turn as Alejandro will be one of the most memorable characters of the year. He has some great scenes. It's hard to avoid some comparisons with Zero Dark Thirty, especially the way some of the scenes were shot and how it focuses (although in a very different way) on two strong motivated female characters who are determined to accomplish their goal in a masculine run world. It also happens to be a very intelligent thriller that manages to tell a familiar story in a fresh way. Sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it that makes the difference and in Sicario Villeneuve manages to craft an engaging work of art. This is the Zero Dark Thirty of war on drug films. \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

But however perfect I want it to be, this movie still has flaws. The characters aren't too unique or interesting  in their own right, they're all just tropes, and the scenes near the end that focus on Benicio del Toro's character, while great, feel out of place with the rest of the movie. Despite the faults that it has, all its accomplishments are enough to outweigh them and to make this the best major motion picture of 2015 so far. A mainstream North American film that is subtle and challenges the audience? Who could've thunk it?",

            "content": "-Sicario is een 2015 Amerikaanse crime thriller film geregisseerd door Denis Villeneuve en geschreven door Taylor Sheridan. De film sterren Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, en Josh Brolin. Deze film  werd gekozen om te strijden voor de Palme d'Or op het 2015 Cannes Film Festival.\n-In december 2013 werd aangekondigd dat Denis Villeneuve  een Mexicaanse grens drama zou dirigeren, Sicario (het Spaanse woord voor Hitman).\n\n--Kritische reactie:\n\n-Sicario wordt alom geprezen door critici. Recensie aggregator website RottenTomatoes, de film heeft een goedkeuringsscore van 93%, gebaseerd op 184 reviews, met een gemiddelde waardering van 8.1/10.. De site's kritische consensus leest. \"Geleid door uitstekende werk van Emily Blunt en Benicio Del Toro, Sicario is een strak, stevig gespannen thriller met veel meer bezig dan aandacht trekkende decorstukken.\" Op Metacritic, de film heeft een gewogen gemiddelde score van 81 uit 100, gebaseerd op 41 critici, met vermelding \"success\". Op CinemaScore, publiek heeft de film een gemiddelde cijfer van \"A-\" op een A TOT F-schaal.\n\n-Richard Roeper heeft de film een tien, noemt het een van de beste van dit jaar, en bejubeld del Toro's performance, zeggende: \"...er is del Toro, die loert over de marge van de actie voor het merendeel van het verhaal, en dan in actie springt in een handvol sc\u00e8nes in een verscheidenheid van manieren die laat  geschud laten - en dankbaar om een zo  mooi donker werk gezien te hebben'.\n-Dan Jolin van Empire heeft de film 5 sterren en noemt het \"een prachtig duistere, keiharde thriller. Gewoon \u00e9\u00e9n van de beste films van het jaar.\"\n\n-hoewel haar personage Kate Mercer niet plausibel is, Emily Blunt \"brazens uit eventuele onrechtmatigheden met grote actering focus en front\".\n\n- \"kunstig en spraakmakend\" en \"onberispelijk realistische momenten\", heeft een aantal tekortkomingen. Ten eerste, de federale agenten\".agressieve tactieken en overtredingen in regels in Sicario zijn veel meer nodeloos dan eender wat hij getuigde in zijn verslag. Ten tweede is er een gebrek aan invallende Spaanse rechtshandhaving agenten, zoals personages, in de film in verhouding tot die momenteel in het echte leven werkend. Tenslotte de film richt zich overwegend op het Amerikaanse oogpunt in de war on drugs.\n\n-heeft de film een B-, waaruit blijkt dat het gebrek aan karakter ontwikkeling was een afknapper ondanks extreem sterke cinematografische en stijlvol regisseren. Hij voegde er nog aan toe dat \"Sicario wellicht \u00e9\u00e9n van de meest melancholische, moreel failliet, en ethisch inhoudsloze mainstream films die dit jaar is uitgebracht; toch, zulke zwaarmoedigheid komt met het grondgebied van het huidige, politicus-gebrandmerkte 'war on drugs'.\n\n-Chris Ryan van Grantland vergelijkt Sicario met de film Apocalypse Now geregisseerd door Francis Ford Coppola. Hij stelt de gelijkenis van de visuals met betrekking tot de respectieve narratieven van de twee films. Hij schrijft ook dat de karakters  Alejandro Gillick, en Matt graven in Sicario zijn vergelijkbaar met die van kolonel Kurtz en William Kilgore, respectievelijk in Apocalypse Now.\n\n--Reactie van ambtenaren in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez (Mexico):\n\n-Sicario's portrettering van Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez werd bekritiseerd door functionarissen van die stad, die dachten dat de film  hun stad in een kwaad daglicht stelde. In de film opgenomen sequenties die kadavers opknoping aan downtown viaducten en nachtelijke vuurgevechten in de stad vertoont. Deze ambtenaren zijn van mening dat op het moment van de release van de film, de intensiteit van criminele activiteit in de stad aanzienlijk waren gedaald ten opzichte van voorgaande perioden.\n\n\n- Bestudering van de Amerikaanse War on Drugs:\n\n-Volgens Sebastian Rotella, Sicario onderzocht vele aspecten van de oorlog tegen drugs door de Verenigde Staten tegen, meestal, drugskartels in Mexico, Zuid-Amerika en Midden-Amerika. Een perspectief nemend als een Amerikaanse, zo merkte hij op dat de film illustreert hoe de Amerikaanse war on drugs is \"wat ons in het bijzonder tot monsters maakt die wij proberen te verslaan.\" Bovendien is de situatie in Mexico, met betrekking tot de illegale drugshandel, gestagneert voor twee decennia, zoals van de film's release. Dit punt is herhaaldelijk door het personage Matt Graves gemaakt in de film.",

This does not, however, hide the fact that the lead character, played by Emily Blunt, is a weak willed female being dominated by her male counterparts. This is a shame, as in the past, Emily Blunt has portrayed very strong female leads, such as in Looper or Edge of Tomorrow. I was looking forward to her dominating the screen, but instead found her crying more than she was helping her mission. The story is interesting, but once everything is set in motion, it is hard not to predict just what is really going on behind the curtain. It would be a mistake not to commend Roger Deakins on his brilliant cinematography, as there are some brilliant shots of Mexico that are haunting in their beauty. The soundtrack also helps to lend a sense of weight to the proceedings. I'm alway impressed with Denis Villeneuve's direction, and this is no exception. If it weren't for the disappointing lead character, and the predictable plot points, this may have been up there for my favourite film of the year. If you enjoy dark thrillers, action films or dramas, this should definitely be on your short list for movies to watch this year. 4 out of 5 stars.",

Though Taylor Sheridan's script is not always as clear, as focused, or as committed as it could be, Sicario remains gripping and entertaining throughout.

The build-up of tension is thus more impactful, with excellent cinematography that captures the sprawling environments which would be explored. The intertwining subplot is only occasionally seen, but it is there to further the ripple effect that the main plot causes.\n\nWhile Blunt and Josh Brolin are solid, Benicio Del Toro is one to look out for, as his character has a lot on his mind. The actors in general do display bits of comic relief to ease the film's stressful nature. Nevertheless, Blunt's character is purposely treated in a sexist manner, only so that she can properly manifest her opposition to the unethical procedures being ran by the team with whom she otherwise thought her methods would be useful.\n\nThe lack of soundtrack of course adds more tension to demanding scenes, while the music that does play is visceral. And off-screen sound plays a key role in the alienation of the plot towards us and Blunt's character.\n\nDenis Villeneuve is however no stranger to tackling unconventional methods of storytelling, and thanks to his and his crew's fine work, Sicario proves to be a mysterious, daring, competent crime thriller.",

It does lose some points for a having a female lead who, in typical Hollywood fashion, ultimately has to be saved by a man.\u00a0 So that was disappointing, I would have liked to see the so-called \"strong female lead\" save herself for a change.\u00a0 But that's really all I can say against it.\u00a0 This is an intelligent, atmospheric, gripping, and thought-provoking psychological thriller, that's also incredibly well made.\u00a0 It doesn't give you the warm fuzzies, nor should it, but it should be seen.",

The plot ends up being overly convoluted and almost annoying, especially Benecio Del Toro's character, however he does play him perfectly. Then you have Emily Blunt's character who is just a complete moron who keeps getting pulled in more and more blindly when Josh Brolin basically just acts like a prick the entire time. The story has many of it's shock value moments and progresses fairly well without too much stop-starting but did not personally appeal to me.",

I saw this in a packed theatre on Sunday night after the Walking Dead... just when I thought I was desensitized to violence, I was rudely awakened and nearly walked out on the movie when my date complained that we were sitting too close and the violent imagery was too intense, but the artistic filmmaking was captivating and we stuck through it. There's not much to say about the plot, since it's more about emotionally exploring the world of drug cartels on the other side of the American border. Through terrible events that occur around and directly to the main character, an idealistic white woman (an important storytelling decision), our sense of American law, order, and justice is crushed. This movie is not for kids and its full impact is best experienced in a dark movie theatre...",

            "content": "The biggest war that America needs to win isn't in the middle east or South Asia. It is deep within its heartland where the drug lords of the Mexican cartels have spread the highly influential poison and there is no sign of it ceasing. Tons of illicit drugs pass through secretive tunnels beneath the borders of USA and Mexico, accounting to some very wealthy and powerful cartels while scores of Americans perish under their harmful effects. Parts of Mexico are literally the most violent places on Earth and while Denis Villeneuve's 'Sicario' showcases all these realities between the borders, it serves merely as a backdrop to the true motive hidden beneath the story's surface. This covert war on drugs by America is completely in the gray area of morality and justice of which, Kate (Emily Blunt) is an exponent. She is, however, only learning to cope with the reality around her which alters itself brutally and that, makes her the perfect proxy for the audience.\n\n\tThe cartel has pushed deeper into American soil with Manuel Diaz controlling much of their trade through his legit businesses. While raiding one of his properties for a kidnapping investigation, FBI agent Kate discovers several decaying bodies hidden behind the walls of a house in Chandler, AZ and a subsequent explosion in the backyard shed leaves two of her agents dead. Determined to bring Manuel to justice, she agrees to volunteer in a covert CIA mission led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). On their way to El Paso, she is introduced to the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), whose shady background keeps Kate on guard but whose sharpness on field soon gains her respect. \nWhat follows is perhaps the most tense, suspenseful sequence where the agents extradite Guillermo (Manuel's brother) in and out of a prison in Juarez. Brilliantly executed with escalating build-up, aerial cinematography of chaos and a thumping background score, this has to be among the finest moments in recent cinema. Emily Blunt's performance thereafter, portraying Kate's disbelief in the irresponsible engagement with the cartel members at the border in the midst of civilians, is outstanding. Throughout the film, she shows her righteous side that upholds justice, procedure and law. She is vocal about the ambiguity of the mission but as the events unfold, she is left with no choice but to become part of Matt's anarchic team. They soon track down Manuel and initiate a plan that would require him to meet the Cartel's head in Mexico to answer some questions. \nAgainst the backdrop of an incredible sunset, the team discovers the tunnel that would lead them to the cartel but Kate sees things she wasn't supposed to. Josh Brolin really gets into his character as he enlightens her about the reality that will be too much for her to handle. He is a bad-ass agent who isn't shaken by the guns firing around him as he chews his gum. Brolin depicts Matt's coldness but with purpose as he sets himself to pursue the bigger objective of the mission. Between Kate's idealism and Alejandro's darkness, Matt is simply a reality check for the situation and Josh Brolin delivers that superbly. Mayhem on a personal level ensues after the tunnel episode and without revealing much of the story's twist, it should suffice to say that it all makes sense in the end. Benicio Del Toro revisits the cartel world after 'Traffic', 'Che' and 'Escobar'. His insight into Alejandro's character seems naturally easy with a rock solid composure under any circumstance that is a result of his dark past. We will never know what he precisely did with the 10 gallon water container that he took into the interrogation room where Guillermo was held and that, is the level of intrigue held by Del Toro's performance. \n\nScreenwriter Taylor Sheridan doesn't just focus on the menace of cartel activity on the streets. The film also goes into its effect on a completely normal family of Silvio, a police officer in Mexico who gets his hands dirty for that extra income. Kate's evolution as a special agent in the war on drugs is in sharp contrast to Silvio's journey. The cinematography by Roger Deakins truly brings out the thrill of imminent danger with vast aerial shots, wide sunset shots and close, dark encounters in the tunnel sequence and the minimalist background score by Johan Johannsson's simply augments the effect.  \nVilleneuve delineates this covert war on drugs without the typical mainstream approach. He shows monstrosity taking over both sides, resulting in total neglect of judicial process, law and morals. Benicio Del Toro is the manifestation of this monstrosity in a laudable performance that should win him a nomination for the Oscars. 'Sicario' isn't triumphant for society but it truly is one of the best thrillers that shows the merciless environment created by the cartels on both sides of the border. \n\n8.987 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "Mexico's gruesome cartel wars makes for a bleak and deeply unsettling subject, but in recent years it's been mined by a number of directors and yielded a slew of terrific films.  Sin Nombre, Cartel Land, Narco Cultura and a few others come to mind.  Sicario has now firmly planted itself in that group.  Probably best described as a cross between Zero Dark Thirty and No Country for Old Men, this movie borrows some of the best elements of both films to paint a brutal, deeply cynical portrait of \"The War on Drugs\" and its gruesome human costs.  \n\nWithout delving too deep into the story since you should see it - tonight if you could - but Emily Blunt gives a terrific turn as strong-headed, by-the-book FBI agent overwhelmed by an amorphous moral morass she finds herself in.  Benicio Del Toro has always been a versatile actor - and he's been one of my favorite character actors since The Usual Suspects.  He's been in enough cartel movies to be dangerously-close to being typecast.  That said, he always brings something extra to these movies and he does amazing work here as a world-weary, mysterious enforcer.  \n\nThe past few weeks have been great for devastatingly-bleak films about real-world issues anchored by phenomenal performances (I saw this shortly after watching Beasts of No Nation which saw Idris Elba and newcomer Abraham Attah deliver awards-worthy work).  Like that film, much of Sicario's haunting power comes from its rootedness in the ugliness of the world we live in but often choose to acknowledge.",

This is a brutal, cold, unflinching and often breathtaking thriller, with awards-worthy work from actors Blunt and Del Toro, as well as covertly masterful cinematography from veteran Roger Deakins. If there's one flaw it's that, whilst Sicario may seep inside you as you watch, the wider point it makes about the situation in Mexico is rather unsubstantial if you consider it a few days later.

Blending an almost majestic quality to the scope and span of the lands between Mexico and the US, which in simple terms for Sicario, the entrance to hell. The three lead performances of Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro are remarkable and mesmerizing to watch, with Blunt's traumatized protagonist leading us through a greenhorn's look at across the Mexican border and into a dark and violent world where law is forgotten and a distant idea. Brolin is likeable and charming as the commander of the squadron, Blunt is remarkable in her depiction of a woman thrust into a very real side of cruelty and injustice, but Del Toro steals the show with his as what I can only call the sicario, or hitman. His character's deeply troubled backstory adds to the disturbing nature of the somber and calm way he handles himself and commits atrocities, making you truly question what he stands for. The action scenes are incredibly thought out and the growing tension and suspense is Hitchcock level in how the scenes are set. The soundtrack adds a dark, ominous and thrilling atmosphere to an already chillingly grim and real movie.",

Yes, that great shoot out in a traffic queue was original, the opening raid extremely surprising and the plot is never predictable.

With good support from Josh Brolin, this is a very well made movie that is grounded in stark reality - only suffering in a slight lack of emotional investment with the characters (for me), due to cold and bleak nature of its story.

A very entertaining and flawlessly executed movie that made me hold my breath multiple times. Sometimes I felt so tense, that any little sound made me jump out of my seat. It's a gritty examination of Mexico's dire drug problem and its effects on the USA. Outstanding cinematography - of a landscape that is character in itself- and music that heightens the tension combine with Villeneuve's superb storytelling and intense performances especially by Emily Blunt- who holds her own in a tough male dominated world. Del Toro and Blunt both deliver outstanding performances, but Emily Blunt has an edge of steel. She brings off a mix of confidence, bewilderment and vulnerability. If you don't wanna watch this movie for its story, watch it for her. She ralmost knocks everyone else unconscious in this movie.\nSicario is the kind of drama/action movie you wanna (or should) see. The tension and emotions are present 110%. The whole time I could not stop asking myself the question ''Who will pull the trigger first?''. You don't really trust anyone except Kate (Emily Blunt) - who is not trusting anyone either. Every time an ally is met, that ally either dies or betrays someone. Sicario is a completely engrossing, beautifully shot, terrifically acted thriller that exceeds expectations. I won't give away the opening scene, but I'd find it hard to believe that you're bored after seeing that. It's ultimately disturbing, kind of dark in a way, but that's also one of the reason why it succeeds: it reaches out to the audience and plays with your emotions.\nVilleneuve's taut direction, combined with beautiful cinematography, and an amazing score, make Sicario one of his best in his constantly growing filmography. The end result is a great movie that will hopefully get recognition at award season. A tense drama that is engaging yet leaves you feeling helpless at the end.",

The film depicts a Mexico overrun with \"bad hombres,\" with \"wolves,\" spilling over and under an ever-present but never adequate border fence. Idealistic FBI agents like Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya can't effectively prosecute this international crime: They're always too late, the violence keeps getting more horrific. Only ruthless, lawless, equally criminal strategies and tactics seem effective, where the corrupting influences of drug money and force spill out from an anarchic Latin America into the US. Josh Brolin's CIA squad and the Colombian-hired \"sicario\" or hitman, Benecio del Toro, need to mount an ambitious covert op. \n\nWe Yanquis do come in for brief flourishes of rhetorical condemnation: A villain accuses the US of \"showing\" our neighbors how to be truly brutal; Brolin complains helplessly about the \"20%\" (?) of Americans buying Colombian cocaine. \n\nBut these deflections don't pack anything like the visceral punch of the lawless violence, the decapitations, the sense of a spreading war zone conveyed in virtually every scene in the film. \n\nI just rolled my eyes when a character who's \"seen to much\" is advised to retreat from the advancing \"wolves\" to a \"small town.\" There are small towns with drug epidemics, gangs, and corrupt cops, cabr\u00c3\u00b3n.

For me, Sicario is one of the most grounded and realistic films i've ever seen. Every gunshot, every stand off and every corpse you see feels tactile, has gravitas and feels important. Rather than a story about the \"War on Drugs\", Sicario is much more a comment on the war and american foreign policy in general which originally took me off guard but I believe offered a much more deep and rewarding narrative for a film of such defined scope. The direction by Villeneuve is remarkably immersive as you the audience are treated just like Kate (Emily Blunt's character) as you are thrown into the story, out of depth and unsure of what lies ahead trying to negotiate the morality of what you see before you. Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin are remarkable while Benecio Del Toro is simply superb and deserves a nomination for, what I feel, is a career defining role as the troubled and enigmatic Alejandro. The moody, steady paced and brooding tone of the picture is matched by Roger Deakins' signature flawless cinematography where images of the vast landscape of Juarez and El Paso flow like liquid and where nighttime shots ACTUALLY look like nighttime!!! The thumping composed score by Johann Johannsson feels like that of a horror movie and keeps tension as high as possible during gripping build ups to shootouts between the cartel and the FBI. To conclude... Sicario is a film where it's weight doesn't hit you until you step out of the screen and really contemplate what you've just witnessed. One of the best films of the year and a real treat.... GO SEE IT!!!!",

Josh Brolin is very funny as the POS FBI guy, and Benicio is an absolute badass, like an Anton Chigurh with a heart of gold. I much prefer this portrayal of our police/military/intelligence communities to that of \"Eye in the Sky\" because the truth is that they are comprised of gradients of awful, murderous people.

Yet Blunt moves with conviction and talks with adamant purpose despite knowing and being repeatedly told she's out of her element. Perhaps the most intriguing part of Kate's character, though, has nothing to do with Blunt. Whereas the majority of feminist films are concerned with building a strong female character, 'Sicario' rather tears its down. Kate is already atop the FBI, she's being asked to join a CIA op, and has displayed prowess in leading the aforementioned raid, and apprehending several other prominent cartel figures. In Mexico she's still surrounded by burley men and still taking orders from masculine superiors in Brolin and Del Toro's characters. Subconsciously we want to believe these conflicts are what empower her as a woman, but, the part being originally written for a male, we rather see Kate's strength where she's weakest. \"I'm not a soldier,\" says Kate, and we believe her because the harassment, violence, and horrors she witnesses justify her loosing grasp on the law and make her human in a land of wolves.\n\nFULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2015/10/04/sicario-review-indieadam/",

Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) this is well executed film with some very tense set pieces.  \n\nThe story focuses on Kate Macy played by Emily Blunt, an FBI agent who has been hand picked to join an elite task force headed by Josh Brolin.  However Macy is kept mostly in the dark about what her job is and it is this separation that the audience also feels.  If Macy is the moral and righteous core on the flip-side you have Benicio Del Toro, who plays Alejandro, a Colombian consultant with some questionable methods of interrogation.  And like Del Toro must of the characters in the film are unapologetic about who they are and realistic about the situation they are in which just adds to the whole sense of alienation and griminess of the film.   \n\nAlthough it is a film that very well made it isn't one that you'll instantly want to watch again.

            "content": "It is unclear why this film was made except for Americans to beat off to yet another mindless action-adventure that the studio tried to make legitimate by including Emily Blunt in the film. The development of the characters in this film likely occurred in ten or twenty minutes with the screenwriter arguing with the director over a bologna sandwich. Matt is the typical brash but yet relaxed government agent of unknown origin, who is somehow made into a complete character here by giving him flip-flops so we can see his relaxed side. Alejandro has all the charisma of Frankenstein uttering lines that would make Tom Cruise blush, such as \"You are asking me how a watch works. Just pay attention to the time.\" There is more drama and legitimacy in any episode of CSI or NCIS than this turd of a movie. We are supposed to believe that Blunt, who appears to have a passive and unnatural role in a kidnapping squad is brought into the inner circle of homeland security/CIA to tag along with special ops and so forth. In her work with the FBI she has likely used a gun once or twice and now is carrying a machine-gun down a tunnel into Mexico. I had to laugh when Alejandro brings Blunt's character a piece of paper at the end to sign to approve of what happened. Sure, sure, that's how it works, there is some piece of paper that CIA or special ops carries around and so long as it is signed, then everything is fine, and how convenient to create an ethical dilemma for the character. The comparisons here to Michael Mann are comedic -- this film is not worthy of the dirty toilet paper used on the set of a film like Heat. There are too many cliches in this film to count -- the slightly overweight slap-happy military types. The older bravado US Marshall types who are OK with joking about drinking to make your hand steady. The older White man Washington insider serious types. The field agent with more of an ethical awareness type who is brought into a world of greater moral ambiguity. The classic American bar scene where you get a couple of beers and have a honky tonk dance but be careful not to get double-crossed rape by border control agent gone rogue who happens to look like a Hispanic version of Bruce Springsteen with his nose broken. And how tragic that those little plastic-y wrist bracelets that everyone wears for cancer awareness and such can now apparently tip us off to anyone with a heart of evil. Josh Brolin steals a lot here from Jesse \"the Body\" Ventura's work in Predator I. How about the scene where Alejandro carefully folds his white linen jacket to add some complexity to his character. I can just imagine the director asking the writer to fill out the character a bit more and the writer comes up with idea of having him fold his jacket. If you want to see a Michael Mann movie, see a Michael Mann movie. If you want to see a two-hour version of CSI Mexico, then you might enjoy this.",

Benicio Del Toro steals the show, like to the point I think Best Supporting Oscar next year, that good. I would've preferred a movie of his characters origin instead of what Sicario ended up being. I'm also a little let down that the movie featured Jeffrey Donovan as a piece of the team and he was in one scene early which was arguably one of the better scenes in the movie. Overall, it was a jumble that tries to seperate itself from the normal movie path, and shines in some areas but is up for interpretation in some other areas. 3.5/5",

            "content": "I was looking forward to seeing this, due to its high ratings by both critics and audience, despite it having a bad trailer. But all I can say after watching it, is \"why?\". The characters were more of just robots than fleshed out people with interesting backstories. The main character was a naive punching-bag, and might as well have been and audience member who also had no idea what was going on. I might have cared about the story or the tension more if I cared in the slightest for any of the characters. The one character that was more than a guy who \"does this\" or is \"Mr. I'm Mysterious\", was Kate's friend who was at least funny and cared about her. To add on to that, there was never a moment where something went wrong. Everything went way too well through the entire movie. Not a single character offed, no unexpected mistakes made by the police, no plot-twists (if it can even be said to have one in the first place).\n\nThe \"plot\" follows an officer who decides to help out some people catch this cartel guy who is bombing places. She is left in the dark about everything, which could have been good if we actually knew anything. After all the shooting and proving that she doesn't know what she's doing in this corrupt place, it becomes a revenge story for the last fifth of the movie. After the \"Revenge Guy\" unsurprisingly kills off the \"Cartel Guy\"s family, the movie ends with solidifying how much of an ass all the other characters are to Kate and showing that she will just willingly take everything up the ass, like the rest of the film. No development, it didn't even feel like something changed by the end of the film, nothing felt different.\n\nAll I have to say about the good in this, is that the acting was good for what they had, the choice of audio was great, and they didn't rely on flashy action scenes when there was action. Maybe most people could self-insert themselves as Kate because the shock factor of having decapitated people and dead children did them in, but it's not that shocking. I saw this and thought, \"Ok, just another day of brutal criminal activity in Mexico\". It's not that different to the stuff that drowns throughout the news every day. This movie is relying too much on us for a reaction.\n\nOverall, the characters are boring, the story is left a mystery as to what the point is, the acting is good but what it was used for was not, the effects and audio were great, and the mexican kid at the end was neither sad nor completely oblivious to the fact that his father is dead, which leaves the scene pretty pointless. If the point of this film was to show how big of a problem the cartel is, the entire story should have been surrounding how much Kate was against it and not waver from that. But in the end, she's just a wuss who just accepts the shit and doesn't really make the people watching it think that it is more than just another crime film.",

Tackling the cartel directly in Mexico. Along the way she meets mysterious quiet but menacing Benicio Del Toro and the fun really starts. \n\nThe is a highly tense ride into a dark world. Excellent thumping soundtrack that adds to the tension. Brilliant cinematography and high/long shots of the vast Mexican land scape. \nAll actors are brilliant especially Del Toro who conveys both the sadness and ruthless drive of his character. Blunt is also brilliant but somewhat frustrating as she try's to play by the book in a world where half measures aren't allowed. \n\nSome surprises, plenty of violence and tension, great acting, twists and turns, shocking scenes. Great soundtrack and shot perfectly.",

Sicario, is another fantastic accomplishment from Mr. Villeneuve. Sicario looks beautiful on the big screen and has an amazing, Oscar-worthy performance from Benicio Del Toro. This film is intense, shocking, and unpredictable. I had no clue what was going to happen. Each scene has a sense of dread, which, in this case, is a good thing, because it added to the suspense. Sicario is also beautifully shot by Roger Deakins. Sicario was ALMOST a masterpiece. But, then there's that one itsy-bitsy little flaw that keeps it from reaching that kind of status. And that flaw is our main heroine. Now, Emily Blunt gives a terrific performance, but, the character is just very irritating. She is constantly questioning and not following orders and it just really doesn't work. You can't connect with her. But, other than that, I had no problems with this film. Sicario is one of the best films of the year. I can't wait to see what Denis Villeneuve does with the new Blade Runner film.\nRating: A",

In this it is much like director Denis Villeneuve's previous film \"Prisoners\", which presented the post-Iraq world with Dick Cheney's torture dilemma; namely, if faced with a \"ticking clock\" scenario, is it ethically permissible to use whatever means necessary (torture) to beat the clock (terrorist attack, but in \"Prisoners\", a hostage scenario)? We the viewers are led to believe that this is an impossible, \"Sophie's Choice\"-type decision. But this is a nonsensical dilemma, as it is founded on false premises, namely, that torture is a reliable method for gathering accurate, \"actionable\" information. \n\nSimilarly, \"Sicario\" presents its audience with quite a predicament: either we act outside the law (violating Mexico's sovereignty, torturing prisoners, assassinating cartel members on behalf of other cartels, using CIA operatives in domestic operations, etc), or else the flow of drugs across America's southern border will be unhindered! Left unanswered (or unasked, really) is the rather pertinent question \"Why would that be a bad thing, exactly?\" If \"Sicario\" weren't attempting to apply \"Zero Dark Thirty\" [sic] reasoning to the contemporary Mexican Drug Wars, one wouldn't think twice about the omission. But alas it does, and one does. \"Sicario\" nails its action/thriller/suspense aspects, but it's not nearly thoughtful enough (in contrast to, say, Soderbergh's \"Traffic\") to get away with lecturing any viewer with a functioning cerebellum.",

The main character played by Emily Blunt was weak and had no arc. She just kept smoking and crying throughout every scene in the movie. Benicio, we love him, but again, his character comes out of no where with super human physical abilities who is able to make a series of head shots with a pistol without aiming. The plot played close to that of a video game minus the action.

Emily Blunt reminded me of Sansa Stark, always emotional and sad, which she does fine, but her performance did not stand out from what one would expect in this role. Del Toro and Brolin gave better performances but they had more interesting characters. The movie was \"mumbly\" as well. In real life, we do not enunciate every sentence to make sure it is spoken clearly and easily understood. So, in that way it is realistic, but you also may miss a few lines. BBC's Sherlock also does this to my annoyance. The pacing was agonizingly, glacially slow. If you take a five star movie and add 15 minutes of non-essential material, it will lose a star. They advertised it as a thriller, but it dragged so much I stopped caring what was going to happen to anyone, and was yawning way more than I wanted to. Like The Hobbit, it would have been much better if it was edited more tightly. What also was annoying was the film focussed so much on the Emily Blunt character, but the real story is about the Del Toro character, which made the storytelling uneven. I was disappointed and I do not see what the critics or the 28K users who really liked it see.",

That all being said, this was my least favorite of Villeneuve's films so far that I've seen of 3 (this, Prisoners, and Enemy). Comparisons aside this was easily one of the years best films and Villeneuve may very well get his first oscar nomination for this one or at least some of the cast at hand here. Especially Emily Blunt who has never been better than she is here. The atmosphere and everything about this film was quite unpredictable and you really never know what is going to happen.

A perfect case for the lack of females in films is the fact she is 1 of 2 woman in the entire film.

I don't know why but I just really get fascinated by how a drug system works or just a character or organizations stuggle in the midst of that dangerous world. Sicario is a brutal no holds barred picture that tackles the drug cartel in mexico but looks even deeper into  human psychology, motives and desires, and just shows a war on two fronts if you will. Emily Blunt, Benecio Del Toro and Josh Brolin lead in this impactful story directed by the man behind the Sinster prisoners flick Denis Villenueve. \n\tKate Macer is an Idealistic FBI Agent who is good at what she does. She is a woman agent in an intense and highly dangerous environment. She gets word that she will be placed on a special task force to find a drug kingpin who is elusive, and has been killing and selling drugs for the longest time. She meets Matt Garver and the mysterious Alejandro. As the film progresses and she goes into the field she witnesses that something fishy is going on and that the guys are going beyond the required jurisdiction.\nThis was just Gritty real and straight up hardcore. It's a film that challenges morality and what could very well shake your moral code. Nice directing from denies villeneuve his style from prisoners carries over here. Sound editing was superb here veeeery real\n Emily Blunt did a really good job here. Kate represents hope and a very idealized kind of individual almost the ideal FBI agent. Only problem I had was with her character development I kinda wished she was a bit stronger of a female character I mean I was kinda hoping she was more like linda Hamilton here and I was hoping she could be more mentally tough because she got broken down on both fronts for a good chunk of the film and it kinda disappointed me a bit but not to much she still did a very good acting job here. \nJosh Brolin did a fine job but the real highlight even beyond blunt is Benecio Del Toro. By the end of the film I came to reeeeally love Benecio del toro's anti hero character alejandro. He lost so much and in such a brutal fashion. He almost is like mirror to kate as they seem to have once been the same kind of person despite working different professions at the time. Del toro portrays such a cold character who has thrown his own morality out the window and is honed in on achieving his goal. He is like a wolf with rabbies that just needs to be pointed in the right direction. Wonder who would win in a fight whitey bulger or alejandro?\nDespite the Emily blunt deal the writing was real neat it sort of a film that builds in excitement and intrigue. Lot of reaaly good shots cinematography wise. Great score too. \nSicario is incredible...nothing else really needs to be said.. go see this when you can!",

Direction by Denis Villeneuve (comparable to Kathryn Bigelow's style in The Hurt Locker) is needle-sharp.

It lack coherence and focus. \n\nThe film starts off centered on F.B.I. Agent Kate Macer and her desire for revenge. Then it becomes a film about the questionable morals of federal policing agencies on the border. Then it mutates into a revenge film about a completely different character. That might work if the plot was not so logically flawed. It might also work if we had more of a back-story on the characters. \n\nIn one scene, Agent Macer takes home a Phoenix cop. It's clearly a set up, and we are expected to believe a trained F.B.I. agent would fall for such an obvious ploy. There is nothing to suggest that she is easily fooled or that the people behind it are that clever. Besides, the plan relies on coincidence and there is no guarantee that it would work. It is based on stereotypical notions of female weakness and illogic and clashes with the notion that Macer is a tough agent. If we knew she had made mistakes of judgement in the past, it might have been more credible. However, almost no backstory is provided for her character. \n\nMacer is a patsy, which is fine, but then why make her the main character? And if she is the main character, why move away from her entirely during a large portion of the film? It is because the film, for all its pretense at making a smart, complex drama is plot driven and the characters are secondary. Thus, the actions that the plot dictates don't make sense for who the characters are. \n\nVisually, the film looks flat. Certainly, part of that is because of the filming in low-light situations. I wonder if it is also because some of it was filmed in HD video, or was it?  The music is good, meaning, I didn't notice it. What holds this film together at all is the acting. Brolin, Blunt and Del Toro are as good a trio of actors as you can find in film, and they deliver. Too bad none of them are let off the reins so we can appreciate their talents. \n\nCritics are fond of discussing the film they wanted to see and then slamming films for not satisfying their preconceptions. So, here it goes. The film needed to focus on either agent Macer or Alejandro (Del Toro) and complete their tale of revenge. Neither of these characters' actions are clever and in fact, they are quite predictable. Good thing the drug lords are easily duped and overpowered.  \n\nRating: Rent it.\n\nThere is no reason to see this in the theater, except perhaps the beautiful overhead shots of the border between El Paso and Juarez. The film attempts to address large themes of betrayal, honor, corruption and revenged, but it misses the target.  \n\nPeace,\nTex Shelters",

When there are no perfect outcomes, we value order over chaos, and as long as there is a 20% drug usage rate among U.S. citizens there will always be a need for someone to maintain that order.",

            "content": "Director Denis Velleneuve brings us his latest thriller with the new film Sicario, an extremely well made film that boasts a great story with even greater performances. The last time we saw Vellenueve have a major release was in 2012?s Prisoners which took us to new depths of a kidnapping investigation and here he does it again with a very layered look at the cartels in Mexico. There are a lot of things that make this movie work but here there is a tag team of greatness between the writer Taylor Sheridan and Denis Vellenueve. Sheridan's writing here is beyond superb as we follow FBI agent Kate Macer who is asked to join a task force that delves deep in Juarez, Mexico as they attempt to take down a major cartel. However not everything is as it seems when a mysterious member of the team, named Alejandro, has an unusual influence over the investigation and Macer dives deeper and deeper into this world. This story has very deep layers of mystery and intrigue that dive into the very foundation of Macer and Alejandro and you just can't help but get caught up in how complex and meaningful these character's actions are and the dialogue actually serves a purpose rather than just having characters spout of lines of random dialogue. Vellenueve's direction of this film takes center stage and takes this fantastic script and shows us how violent these cartels are as well as how intimate these characters can be when dealing with these horrific realities. There is a sense of suspense that never falters and makes the more intense scenes more exciting as well as powerful. His eye for the sense of setting here is even more impressive with each scene being filled with the perfect amount of atmosphere that really makes us feel as if we are in Juarez while these events are taking place. The cast here is absolutely phenomenal with Emily Blunt as Kate Macer. Her delivery in this movie is nothing short of masterful and as the film progresses we get invested in her and we truly learn to understand her. We also get to see Josh Brolin deliver as the team coordinator and Victor Garber does great as Macer's boss at the FBI. However the real standout here is Benicio Del Toro as Alejandro. Del Toro gives one of his best performances to date here as his screen presence just makes scenes both suspenseful and exciting. His portrayal as Alejandro is so complex and deep that we hang on to every action he makes as well as every word he utters. Simply, Del Toro steals the show. While all these things are beyond great there is an issue that holds back the film and that is in the pacing. Some of these scenes really drag at times and the plot becomes a bit convoluted at times/ There are some points that could have been shorter or cut all together, but as it is Sicario is still a phenomenal film. This movie tells a truly deep story that is filled to the brim with realism as well as great character moments where we identify with nearly everyone in this film. Sheridan's script is amazing and Vellenueve's eye for filmmaking is second to none with this movie. I highly recommend this film, there are some pacing issues but they are made up for with the great cast and great characters. Sicario is simply a movie you have to see.",

Emily Blunt is devastatingly magnificent as incorruptible, perhaps quixotic FBI agent Kate Macy. Not even a best actress Oscar nod would do her tortured performance justice. Take your opinion of her previous best work and multiply that by a million. Blunt scores with vulnerability in a harrowing, soul-crushing and impossible situation. However, even the esteemed actress cannot outshine a riveting, distressing turn by Benicio Del Toro. The truth of his character unravels inch by inch until the climax when he is terrifyingly naked with nothing else to lose. If he does not at least garner a best supporting actor nomination, you should boycott the Academy Awards. Josh Brolin also merits a mention for some superb acting. The gore is grotesque and the depiction of extremist cartel violence vomit inducing. If you want a feel good fall story, stay the bleep away from this film, which packs gut punch after gut punch with no apologies. Sicario leaves a haunting aftertaste that may linger forever.",

It's a very well-made and well-acted film, stylish and suspenseful and timely in a way that would suggest the possibility of valid insights into the dealings of the cartels in Mexico - the fact that it fails to deliver on that final point is the issue here.\n\nI don't have a problem with the construction of this film at all; the substance is what's objectionable, a fundamentally misguided defense of unethical, illegal, and hyper-masculine actions in dealing with the cartels while simultaneously ignoring the larger context that would nullify this defense entirely. American domestic policy regarding the prohibition of drugs contributes significantly to the prevalence and pervasiveness of these cartels, creating an illegal system that allows these drug networks to thrive. The fact that the film condescends to those who it would perceive as being \"weak\" for not wanting to engage in the actions it portrays as necessary evils is baffling and supremely ignorant.\n\nAmerica is not the hero this film makes it out to be, one willing to get down and dirty in order to solve problems that idealists like Blunt's character can't handle (the fact that they've provided the moralistic, \"weak\" role the the film's only woman is a disappointingly sexist misstep); we are actively contributing to the problems that plague Mexican citizens, and people like Brolin's despicable character are not \"strong\" realists for engaging in their morally dubious actions while ignoring the larger picture. This fundamental problem seriously hinders what could've been an excellent political thriller, and its portrayal of torture as well as an indefensible rape joke thrown in among this misguided narrative only contributes to the bad aftertaste it all leaves in your mouth.\n\nVilleneuve seems to have a serious conservative streak in him (Prisoners had similar issues with attempting to justify illegal, despicable violence by simply pointing to the existence of evil), and its holding him back from creating something truly great. His technical prowess is undeniable; if only his ideology wasn't so retrograde.",

That journey was called Sicario!\n\nSicario staring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and the immense Benicio Del Toro has easily made it into my top 10 films since the start of 2000. \n\nThere are so many reasons why i think this but I refuse to name them all as i lack the imagination and English skills to do them any justice. But what I will say is from the Acting (everyone) stunning cinematography, musical score that builds the tension so much I could almost hear my arse tightening up! And also the plot and brutal story of the Mexican cartel gang world that just grips you by the throat, squeezes every ounce of air from your body and occasionally lets you breath gasps of air once each scene ends. \n\nThis film was very much like my sex life, lasted around the 2 hour mark and yet felt like I had sat down, BLINKED, then I was told to leave. But with a great feeling that I have just been involved in something epic yet brutal.\n\nPs. Even after seeing mutilated bodies, drug lords and corrupt police officers I still want to visit Mexico and eat there food.\n\n10/10 as intense as being blue balled, says ***the_beauman***",

            "content": "Sicario is a grim tale of crime and murder that pulls no punches in the violence department and is bar none the most beautiful, dark-themed movie I've ever seen courtesy of the brilliant cinematographer, Roger Deakins. The acting is incredible with stellar work from Josh Brolin and powerful performances from Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro; the latter completely stealing the movie with his uncertain alliances and solemn demeanor. The film is helmed by mastermind director, Denis Villeneuve who gets right to the grit in the opening scene and sets the tone early that this is going to be a bumpy ride and it's beyond impressive. However, after the spellbinding first act that was non-stop tension, I found the story slowed way down and took a little bit too long to pick up again as what was happening in between wasn't all that interesting. I also take issue with the eventual reveal about Blunt's character who you realize didn't matter at all in the grand scheme of the plot and she's actually absent for most of the climax; which annoyed me as she was being built-up so well to be an amazing character. The climax is insanely well-done though beginning with a Zero Dark Thirty-esque night-vision raid that keeps escalating until Del Toro's character, Alejandro takes matters into his own hands and does what it takes to bring down the villains. I'm a bit mixed on the impact of the film because I believe the story wasn't all that remarkable, but it's undeniable that I was riveted through most of it, Roger Deakins can make the ugliest of scenes gorgeous, and the performances, especially from Del Toro, will keep you engaged until it's final moment.",

            "content": "Sicario: 9.5/10\nThis is the best movie to come out of Hollywood in 2015. It's my favourite movie to come out of Hollywood this year, at least.\nIt's the story of an idealistic FBI Agent Kate Macer (the gorgeous and brilliant Emily Blunt) getting sucked into a dangerous, drug cartel-busting assignment with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin, in what could be one of his career's finest performances) and the ice-cold man-with-a-death-stare Alejandro Gillick (the ever efficient Benicio Del Toro). And it begins on an ominous note, with the message: \"Sicario is a word for zealots in ancient Jerusalem, who hunted down and killed Roman invaders. In Mexico, Sicario means hitman.\"\nGiving away any more of the story is a disservice, because Sicario is a film that must be experienced. This is one of those non-sci-fi non-gimmicky films that ACTUALLY deserves to be screened in an IMAX theatre, so you can lose yourself in Roger Deakins' jaw-dropping, trance-inducing cinematography. That, coupled with the chilling, yet calming score of Johann Johannsson, makes this one of the finest cinematographer-music director collaborations, to help with Denis Villeneuve's brilliant direction.\nIt isn't flawless though. Sicario comes with a not-so-tight script that takes away from the experience. Denis Villeneuve is the man who's given us Incendies, Enemy, Prisoners, Polytechnique and the like. Compared to those, this feels like he's played a little safe with the script. The screenplay slows down in the middle, especially to the point of the intermission. But his direction still makes this an edge-of-the-seat experience. It makes all the slowness feel like a live, ticking bomb.\nI also had a problem with Emily Blunt's character, Kate Macer. Throughout the movie I was expecting her to do things differently, and most of the times I was left disappointed. I wondered, 'why isn't she as strong as she can be? Why is Emily Blunt playing such a weak character?' But then, with wisdom from my friend Achyuth Sankar, I realised that Kate Macer is actually a reflection of the human race - given the same circumstances, we would react exactly the same way. And that is what pissed me off more than anything else - that in life, when you're powerless, you truly ARE powerless and there's nothing you can do.\nTalking about the human race, there is someone who's not-so-human in our midst. How does Benicio Del Toro do it? How does this man straddle between English and Spanish with so much ease? How does he manage to be so ice-cold, almost Anton Chigurh-like, and yet make you root for him in a weird way? He has all the best lines in the film, especially these:\n\"Nothing will make sense to your American ears, and you will doubt everything that we do, but in the end you will understand.\"\n\"Finding this man is like finding a vaccine.\"\nMoving on to the third important cog in this wheel, Josh Brolin. Right from turning up in the meeting room in flip flops to his wisecracks and quips at Emily Blunt, Brolin has had a ball of a time, and this might be one of his best performances.\nHey, you know what HBO? Cast Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro in a season of True Detective. Set it in the heart of Mexico, preferably Juarez. And get Cary Fukunaga to direct, with Roger Deakins as the cinematographer. OH YEAH.\nAll I'd like to say in the end is, well done Denis Villeneuve, Roger Deakins, Johann Johannsson, Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin.\nGo and watch Sicario people. You should not miss this one in the theatres.",

            "content": "Blend a bit of Traffic, Training Day and a pinch of Se7en and you're on your way to getting the vibe of this super-slick thriller.\n\nRoger Deakins' cinematography contrasts the scorched, barren landscape of the U.S./Mexico border and the shady, midnight dealings of the FBI to great effect. The atmosphere created continues to ride a murky grey line between the two worlds, highlighting the conflicting attitudes of the central characters portrayed by Blunt and Del Toro.\n\nThe war on drugs theme gives you the sense of Soderbergh's Traffic, but the quandary suffered by central character Macy (Blunt) as she is thrust into the slimy world of Matt & Alejandro (Brolin and Del Toro) is very reminiscent of Training Day. There's the great acting of both those films, as well as the superb acting, but Sicario succeeds in having a female character that be considered both weak and strong.\n\nEarly on Blunt is shown to be a women just getting by in a man's world - always one step behind, having to ask questions and not quite in a powerful enough position to do anything about it. I thought it an illusion of a strong female character; portrayed to be strong because she's holding a gun, cussing and smoking. However, as the gripping story powered on it became clear that her strength came from still fighting for her ideals against a brick wall of secrecy and dirty deals.\n\nSome of the set pieces are very taut and the whole piece is very well directed. However, I found a few times I predicted quite a few moments that were intended to be shocks. This should in no way take away from screenwriter Taylor Sheridan and director Denis Villeneuve, who have delivered a fine film, that kept my attention throughout, in an time where mediocrity is so easy. \n\nBenicio Del Toro hasn't been this good in years (with the exception of Che) and Blunt and co. add to the universally great performances.\n\nWell worth a watch.

            "content": "In the film's opening, a title card explains \"In Mexico, Sicario means hit-man\", immediately setting a tense tone throughout the film. French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Enemy), working from a dark and dangerous script by Taylor Sheridan, steps into the haunting world of America's war on drugs. The subject matter and this story in particular could have easily turned into a generic, fast-paced and dumbed down Hollywood production, but Villeneuve's execution makes the film stand tall as an exhilarating crime thriller. The film is set on either side of the U.S. - Mexico border, but in this narrative, the border is more conceptual than anything. It is a place of anxiety, violence and moral compass.\n\nKate Macer (Emily Blunt) is an FBI agent assigned to tracking down kidnapping victims of Mexican drug cartels in the American Southwest. Early on, it is suggested that she volunteer - she can't be officially assigned- for an interagency joint task force. She joins in hopes of making a bigger difference and quickly finds out nothing is as she was told it would be. Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) is a government agent of shadowy provenance, officially an \"advisor,\" yet as a playful provocateur he seems to have vast resources at his disposal and free rein in the field. Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is introduced first by Graver as a \"bird dog\" but reveals himself to be much more than that. Moving freely back and forth between the U.S. and Mexico, the trio are trying to disrupt the flow of money and drugs in hopes of causing higher-ups in the Mexican cartel to make a mistake and reveal themselves.\n\nVilleneuve, who stepped into similar moralities in Prisoners, maintains a masterful balance between the brutal and violent world of the story and deeper ethical ambiguity. The film is shot once again by the legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins (who worked with Villeneuve on Prisoners), and it is absolutely wonderful. The shots are steady and wide with beautiful colour pallets. It gives the film a fantastic sense of the world we are witnessing on the screen, the vicious and cruel world where morality seems to be lost forever. A haunting score by Johann Johannsson heightens the film's ominous mood and gives it a personality. This is the work of someone who has an opinion on this subject, and truly believes in his film which recalls Michael Mann's Heat and Steven Soderberg's Traffic. The pacing is slow and steady but the tension is endless with a smart script that manages to be simple enough to follow and plenty of surprises along the way. The film portrays the so-called war on drugs not as a battle to be won but as an existential minefield, something that changes people with the best of intentions and turns them into monsters. This is both a nail-biting action thriller and a social commentary on a world in which right or wrong have become essentially irrelevant.\n\nThe acting is superb across the board with Emily Blunt showcasing one of her best performances to-date. Her character is reactive and underwritten in some aspects, but her performance makes up for this problem. Her character is both emotionally affecting and athletically adept, ultimately becoming the movie's heart and soul in a story where having a moral conscious seems irrelevant. She manages to create some of the film's highlights including the nail-biting opening sequence and a slam-bang action highpoint in her apartment.  Benicio Del Toro is also fantastic as the mysterious Alejandro, who guides the team in their operations. His character is cold and brutal, making some of the tense moments even more watchable. Their chemistry is where this story truly shines because morally, they are polar opposites but they are circumstantially linked to the same world of crime and violence. Among the many things discussed in Sicario is the cyclical nature of violence and how feelings of hope and logic factor into its endless turmoil for better or worse. Alejandro is light years away from the idealism that Kate exhibits and how they try to unravel one another is an absolute joy to watch.\n\n\nSicario manages to do pretty much everything it sets up and rarely misses a step. This is a slow but tense thriller full of intriguing characters and scenes that would be remembered for a long time. The top-notch acting, a mesmerizing score and camera work that is surely among the year's very best, all make this a must-see for film lovers. The subject matter is also timely and relevant as an increasing number of Americans have come to realize that the war on drugs has corrupted everyone involved. The film's bleak and nihilistic ending offers no hope that it can ever be won, or that the corruption won't continue to win over. When Kate argues that the strike team's actions are legally out of bounds, a superior sets her straight: \"The boundaries have been moved,\" he says. And will clearly continue to be.",

            "content": "Cops and cartels, midnight raids and public shootouts, blood vendettas and hidden agendas, and a whole lot of dead bodies literally walled up in a house of horrors. If you told me all of this sounds like it belongs in a trashy detective novel, I'd probably agree. If told me it all sounds like it belongs in a trashy movie I'd say, \"Hold the phone! Who says the movie has to be trashy?\"\n\nAnd of course, it isn't. French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve insinuates and executes all of these familiar genre tropes with hitman-like precision in Sicario, delivering one of the most cringe-inducing, butt-clenching, downright excruciating films of the year... And I mean every one of those in the best possible way.\n\nWorking from a twisty screenplay by actor-turned-writer Taylor Sheridan (Sons of Anarchy), Villeneuve has crafted an excellent thriller that's every bit as refined (if not more so) as the glossy biopics and period pieces that angle for adult dollars at the multiplex every fall. Along with 2012's Prisoners and last year's Enemy, Sicario further embosses his reputation as a filmmaker capable of elevating even the pulpiest story material with his surgical attention to form and construct.\n\nEmily Blunt headlines as Kate Macer, a straight-laced federal agent caught in a crooked system. Frustrated that her Sisyphean campaign against the drug trade is going nowhere, she eagerly volunteers for a special task force designated to take the fight to the cartels.\n\nNow under the direction of an unnervingly casual Dept. of Defense adviser (Josh Brolin) and his mysterious partner (Benicio Del Toro, quietly intense as ever), Kate can only hold on for dear life as she's thrust onto a whole new battlefield in the war on drugs; One made up of gargantuan, writhing border towns and dark, winding tunnels, where her enemies are hiding in plain sight.\n\nAn apt casting call for this highly physical role, Blunt exudes just as strong an action-movie presence as her Full Metal Bitch from Edge of Tomorrow. It's an unfortunate shortcoming that she's written less as an active participant in the story than as an audience surrogate, mostly watching it unfold while dodging bullets.\n\nWe are meant to be as nervous and appalled as she is by the unethical back channels and by the blind eyes of her superiors. \"You are acting within bounds,\" insists her FBI boss (Victor Garber). \"The boundary has been moved.\" But as Sicario spirals towards its bloody climax, it seems more and more that the boundary has been completely erased, leaving us to contemplate who are more monstrous; The traffickers or the feds?\n\nVilleneuve is a master of mood, with a penchant for suspense that rivals Hitchcock. His timing of the film's first jump scare instills the viewer with an enduring dread of what sudden horror will startle us next; A dread which allows him to stretch the tension tighter than a drum for prolonged (practically agonizing) periods of time.\n\nMaster cinematographer Roger Deakins (probably en route to Oscar nomination #13) composes every frame with grace and grit. His camera shifts elegantly between POV to objective angles, sometimes within the same shot. When coupled with the atmosphere of Tim Ozanich's sound design - which superbly integrates J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's stealthily scary music - these images put the viewer square in the danger zone with the embattled narcs. You don't merely feel that they are unsafe. You feel unsafe.\n\nIt's more than enough to keep us perpetually rapt, even when the script goes sadistically dark. It's true that the morbidities of Sicario may well cross the line for what general audiences would consider \"prestige drama\", but a director of Villeneuve's caliber proves that great storytelling knows no genre. The boundary has been moved.\n\n***1/2 out of ****",

Emily Blunt, who is a lead FBI agent, of the kid-nap response team in Arizona, has discovered an unusual case of kid-naps. Emily is not entirely sure what is going on after a gross, but sickening discovery of dead bodies found in the walls of an Arizona home. With confusion and anger, after a bomb explosion that lead to two agents dead, left Emily anxious for answers on who was responsible for so many murders.   \nJosh Brolin, a drug enforcement chief recruits Emily for her outstanding experience in the field. She is misled and confused on what her actual position is with the narcotics team. She elaborates that she is a specialty in the field of abduction. But, with her shaky vibe of the recent discovery of over 20 dead bodies; she is determined to catch those responsible of those who caused the explosion and the death of two fellow co-workers. \nShe meets with Benicio Del Toro, on a private jet provided by the agency, just some of the perks for working with the big guys. But, Benicio remains mysterious throughout the film. She is misled by thinking she is working on a case in El Paso, Texas. When on the jet, she is somewhat informed that she is actually going to work on a case in Juarez, Mexico. Emily is still confused on the purpose of her position on the case. Josh Brolin, reveals the necessity of Emily working with the drug enforcement team up until the near end of the film.\n Brolin and Del Toro are two sneaky individuals that show no remorse on their actual intensions. Brolin and Del Toro are two individuals that play the game their way. Jurisdiction is not a word in their vocabulary.\n The title of the film Sicario, means hitman in Mexico. It was difficult to make some connection with the title of the film, throughout the movie, up until the end of the film. Sicario had me wondering before the ending, on why the film was named Sicario. I love the structure of the film and the way it had me wondering throughout the film. \nTowards the end it was still unclear on what was behind Brolin's motive. Del Toro was later revealed as a character that explained the title of the film. Brolin was still a mysterious shot caller that never actually revealed himself and the reason for why he was willing to work with Del Toro. \nIt would be nice if there was some clarity on who Brolin really is. I can say, the story line was clear and interesting. Emily's performance was utterly compelling; she played a victim in some sense, but was a scared agent overall. There is no error in the story line, but this film had a trailer focused on action. Sicario, was a film more on the suspenseful side with little action to relate to its trailer.",

            "content": "Sicario is a Spanish term for hitman. This was introduced to the audience at the beginning of the movie. The movie focuses on Kate, an FBI agent who volunteered herself to capture the people in charge of operating drug cartels in Mexico. As they arrived in El Juarez, Mexico, the agents faced reality of how drug traffickers took over the land. Dead bodies were hung by rope over a bridge and gangsters drove through the streets to patrol the area. The agents knew that they needed to act quickly in order to clean up the mess. \n\t\"Sicario\" was a suspenseful movie where the director, Denis Villeneuve, did a wonderful job on tackling the relationship between the movie and reality. Portrayed by actress Emily Blunt, Kate joined a mission without knowledge of what was going on around her. She came from a background where she learned to be on top of every mission and knew exactly what happened in her surroundings. However, Kate struggled to follow the assignments given to her because she was not aware of the specifications of her duty and new endeavors to overcome. Higher authorities were often bribed to run deliveries, protect dealers, and hint information to cartel members.\n\tDenis Villeneuve attempted to portray accurate the views on state police members. When a dealer went through the tunnel and needed a ride, a state policeman was usually the one that gave him a ride. The corrupted officials often gave cartel members information on what was going on around the states. If any whistleblowers were to be caught, the cartel members would send people after their family. \n\tThis movie brought out the best in all the actors and actresses. From an audience member's point of view, each cast member acted out their roles perfectly. Cast members were able to depict their characters' lives, allowing the audience to truly understand the lifestyle in the movie. In addition, the cinematography captured every aspect of El Juarez to the smallest details.\n\tI did have a critique about the movie. If there were to be a change in the movie, I would suggest to add or remove the bar scene. Kate and her friend, Reggie, ran into one of Reggie's ex-coworker at the bar, who happens to be a state policeman. Kate decided to casually date him. Unfortunately, he ended up working for the cartel in which he tried to kill her when she found out. What I did not like about this scene was how it was a coincident for both Kate and the officer to hook up, as he ended up being a corrupted officer. Realistically, a good friend would not intentionally introduce someone to an individual that would cause harm. If Reggie were to invite him out on a separate occasion, this would have been a better scene than just running into each other at a specific bar.\n\tOverall, \"Sicario\" was wonderfully directed; I was captivated throughout the whole movie. It was full of suspense and never had a dull moment. Denis Villeneuve invoked emotion with each scene and connected it with real life situations. This movie was an eye opener to the audience because most people never understood how corrupted the state officials can be. Working within a cartel will never end well; members will either shoot or get shot at. With a movie this realistic, people will now understand the war against drug cartels.",

If Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock made a Mexican terrorism actioner, it would look a lot like this. Call it Crosstown Traffic, Steven Soderbergh's already timely drug drama made even timelier by an escalating narcotics war down south and framed with direction that's every bit as knowing and edgy. Though the set pieces stop your heart, your mind can't help but keep going at a feverish pace, always on the lookout for the next double cross or stray bullet. It constricts you from the get-go for a long con but Sicario's serpentine scheme never disappoints. \n\nIn this R-rated thriller from director, an idealistic FBI agent (Blunt) gets enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs along the U.S. and Mexico borders. \n\nThrough the eyes of the sometimes naive but rarely helpless agent Kate (an ace and award-worthy performance by Emily Blunt), Taylor Sheridan's script pits filmgoers in the midst of a deadly war that oftentimes seems pointless but the drive of the characters keeps you fully bullet-proof vested. Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro likewise give powerhouse performances, though the latter is inarguably the showier of the two. Denis Villenueve's taut atmospheric direction takes center stage, however. The Prisoners' helmer makes a Hitchcockian thriller without a Hitch. It's his own baby, killer turns and all. \n\nBottom line: Wonder Drug",

It drags you, face first, into the raging drug war between US forces and Mexican cartels. South of the border, we see a house raid that uncovers dead bodies decaying behind walls. An explosion results in the deaths of several men belonging to Emily Blunt's team. It puts her on a mission to draw out one of the major drug lords responsible, with U.S. forces led by Josh Brolin, cooperating alongside the silent and mysterious Benicio del Toro.\n\nOnce into Juarez, Mexico, we see a disturbing scene of mutilated corpses hanging in the street. This is part of a 15 to 20 minute scene of pure tension that grips you from start to finish. Steady photography follows a police convoy through the streets and traffic. Ariel shots glide over the city and dry landscape. A haunting score with it's ominous deep rumbling is present throughout. The scene ends with a brutal shootout on a border crossing. It's the beginning of Blunt's journey into a mission that blurs the line between crime and justice.\n\nThe cast are all on top of their game. Emily Blunt has starred in a variety of roles in different genres, and here we see her tough yet vulnerable, a believer in justice and going by the book. Benicio del Toro becomes more important as the story progresses, his motivations unclear until the end, a frightening figure with a hunger for revenge. Josh Brolin is also great, a shady task force leader who knows everything about the brutal world he operates in. My one complaint was the little time given to the the drug lords who are only introduced towards the end.\n\nWith a runtime of two hours, the film never out stays it's welcome. The tone is consistent and rarely strays from the tense and grim style, with spots of humour here and there. The pace of the film ticks along nicely without over explaining or rushing important scenes. Again, the score by Johann Johannsson is fantastic with low rumblings that build into a wall of noise. \n\nSuspenseful, compelling and sophisticated on it's own terms, Sicario mostly side steps mainstream predictable expectations, and it's all the better for it.",

            "content": "\"Don't ever point a gun at me again\".\n\n'Sicario' is a master-class in ramping up the tension. It's right up there with the best of them. Tense, twitchy scenes fit perfectly into the drug war story. Where something like 'Sabotage' failed (quite badly) 'Sicario' does it with ease. All film makers going for a similar plot with teh cartel, drugs DEA whatever link there is should look at this. Building the tension up, slowly twisting the screw and never really letting up completely - even when it comes to teh conclusion it still has you.\n\nAs many adverts have stated 'Sicario' means hitman in Mexico. Meaning the real central character is 'Alejandro' (Benicio Del Toro) but it's lead through the eyes of 'Kate' (Emily Blunt). Displaying her skills in the opening segment (which already starts to raise things) she tackles what is meant to be a kidnap operation only to discover more and be inducted into a special operation to take out the head of the Mexican cartel - headed by 'Matt' (Josh Brolin). By the end it's hard to judge what is the right thing to do and who is doing it. It's intentionally murky with its perception of good - there's revenge, pride and manipulation at every turn.\n\nIt's clich\u00e9d but the audience and 'Kate' know as much as each other. Her reaction to things synced pretty well with me, she may be part of the FBI but this is new territory for her. It's never clear what they're doing until it's already done. There's as much mystery about 'Matt' and his team as there is 'Alejandro' and his objectives. This could be tiresome and uninteresting but the intrigue and rising tension kept me glued to the film.\n\nThere's also what has to be the best use of night vision iv'e ever scene and one of if not the most tense thing Iv'e ever seen on screen. Watch out for that because it blows 'Zero Dark Thirty' out of the water. Despite all the sides involved, drug empires and secret government ops there isn't all that much action and it's all teh better for it. If you're expecting something with explosive set pieces you won't get them here. It's rather, littered with more intricate constructed moments.\n\nUpping his game from 'Prisoners' 'Denis Villeneuve' has mastered his art. Where teh previous had some problems 'Sicario' never ever lets up the feeling of un-ease. Managing thanks to some clever camera work keep at a level even when there's nothing happening. 'Emily Blunt', 'Benicio Del Toro' and 'Josh Brolin' are all in excellent form here. Intense, startling and unflinchingly committed to being fair on all fronts, 'Sicario' is that rare thriller - very smart and very very good.",

Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin give terrific performances with Blunt's character being the rookie by the book officer who's in way over her head and Blunt gives us something great to watch. The same can be said for Brolin's hard edged but very laid back character, he too clocks in a wonderful performance. But perhaps the best is Benicio Del Toro who is absolutely incredible, stealing the scene everytime he appears, his character is quiet but harbours something dark and he only reveals his true self until the end in what is one of the most intense shootout in film. The music is loud and brazen and it conveys horror whenever played, it never feels out of place and it fits the subject matter perfectly. And Roger Deakin's cinematography is outstanding, when it's dark it's dark, you can't see the character's faces and even that gives it such a realistic and gritty feel, it's Oscar worthy. Dennis Villeneuve has given us a perfect film, a film that doesn't glamourise or make the war on drugs seem cool, instead, he's offered us the most realistic take on it since Traffic. Everything is Oscar worthy and it's sure to be the most nominated movie this year. Sicario is just mesmerising, I love this film and I can't wait to watch it again.",

            "content": "I believe this is one of the first movies I have seen where the trailers lead you to believe 'action' movie, but instead, Sicario stands out as one of the best ghost stories of the year.\n\nThe mood.  The setting.  The characters.  The score.  The cinematography.  The direction.  The dialogue.  Everything about it comes together as more of a horror story than any action movie ever could.  In fact, everything is so tightly wound in every scene, sitting through this for two hours felt like walking through a haunted house.\n\nThe entire premise for director Denis Villeneuve, who directed Prison Break and Enemy...both excellent, is to place the audience in the shoes of Emily Blunt's Kate.  Just like her, you as a viewer are completely unaware of what is going on.  Who do you trust?  Who's the bad guy?  It's not only until the final stretch do you really get an idea, not even the whole truth, of what her purpose for being there is.  It's her most stoic performance yet and thrown up with the best of hers like Edge of Tomorrow.\n\nBenicio Del Toro may steal the show, however.  His brooding silence.  His efficiency at his job.  His delivery of both dialogue and mannerisms.  He is the ghost you fear.  The way he and Josh Brolin play off each other leads you to believe its a symbiotic relationship, but quite frankly, there is a point in the film where even Brolin's character says to follow Del Toro's lead without question.  I mean...the movie's title is really about Del Toro's character anyway.  Sicario = hitman.  I've seen Brolin do some good acting before, but here he hammed up the stereotype of government lackey a bit too much with his snarky and loose attitude.\n\nAs far as direction goes, the car chase through Juarez must go down as one of the best sequences of the year.  What a brilliant idea to keep not only the pacing of the film consistent, but a chance to get a good drive by of what makes these cartel wars so violent.  There's no lingering for too long for fear you might not make it out alive.\n\nSicario stayed small in its scope by limiting everything to Arizona and the border around Juarez and El Paso.  It was a great look at how things are handled (though to a certain elevated extent most likely) without having to see Washington DC or the higher powers.  Del Toro and Blunt give masterful performances in one of the best ghost stories of the year.",

To say the least, enough happens in the film's first tightly acted, edited, and directed 30 minutes to propel the intrigue of its premise and adrenaline of its execution throughout the film despite some uneven pacing.  \n\nWhen Sicario succeeds, it succeeds at such a level that some of the shallow narrative flaws and minor issues can be pushed to the side.  You can feel the intensity, emotion, and dedication emanating from each scene because it's very easy to tell that this is exactly the project that director Denis Villeneuve has been building towards.  It is a story rooted deep within his own interests and heritage and a story of which he surely felt needed to be told, and he mostly succeeds in emulating his personal sense of urgency and importance unto the audience.  \n\nThe most fascinating part of Sicario is that it isn't too heavy-handed in its approach.  It manages to entertain in balanced doses while still finding a way to pass along some vital social commentary that manages to sit uncomfortably with even those of which aren't personally familiar with the events and settings being depicted.  I did take issue with certain aspects of the narrative, however, that I felt to be extraneous and perhaps even unnecessary, and to me these parts really got in the way of the otherwise smooth direction of the film.  I can't mention these narrative aspects specifically, but it should be clear as a good deal of time is given for these detracting subplot elements to unfold in a way that really interfered with my ability to stay focused on the central plot.  And to that end, Sicario doesn't really tell all that profound or unique of a story to begin with, but given the precise, calculated plotting, confident and bare-knuckle direction, and (of course) Roger Deakins' flawlessly detailed and complex cinematic abilities, it's easy to overlook this fact.  \n\nThe impeccable performances all around are worth mentioning just as well with a truly defining performance given by Benicio Del Toro who basically gave me the chills through his sheer confidence and obvious passion for the role.  Overall, Sicario marks itself as a notable entryway into the award season for films this year given its highly admirable round of qualities.  It isn't groundbreaking or really even that original but it is told in a way that certainly pins itself as one of the better movies of the year and, for many reasons, stands out as a rather memorable film.  Much more than your average entertainment fare.",

The acting was fine and good, the plot fine and good, the movie fine and good.  But I can't imagine paying to watch this now that I have seen it.  It was just disappointing, particularly after all the rave reviews.  IAs it is,  don't feel any better for having spent two hours of my time watching this movie.",

            "content": "With the plethora of popular fiction devoted to the doomed drug war, it's slightly hard to get excited about a movie retreading the same ground as Traffic or similar films in this genre. But Sicario is, for a lack of a better way to express this, pretty fucking great. The plot centers on a female FBI agent specializing in special tactical breach and clear missions who finds herself recruited by a shadowy team of DEA agents planning to go on the offensive against Mexican drug cartels across the border in Juarez. Emily Blunt subtly and emotionally plays this protagonist as she finds herself in over her head and struggling to maintain her moral compass amid the carnage. Josh Brolin plays a slimy CIA agent so easily that perhaps we should worry about what he does with his time when he's not acting. But it is Benicio Del Toro who steals the show. His icy, murderous double assassin acts as a sword of vengeance and a warning about those who fight monsters. Notably there is a dichotomy between the FBI characters who attempt to operate in civilian legal procedure with arrests, investigations, and public transparency, and the DEA/CIA team who are heavily militarized, use direct force, torture liberally, manipulate the criminal underworld, and engage in Special Forces style assaults.\n\nSicario is a notably beautiful looking film for being so riddled full of grotesque violence and it demands the viewer's attention. While others may find comparisons to Traffic, I personally feel it has more in common with Zero Dark Thirty, in terms of the strong female protagonist, the direction and cinematography, and final night vision fueled spec ops raids. Of course, where Zero Dark had an uplifting, bittersweet ending, Sicario makes a salient point about the failure and futility of the drug war. It's about as on the nose as you can get, but it doesn't prove to be a fatal artistic flaw. The cold, violent nature of this piece may deter some viewers, but the rest are in for a hellish but rewarding and entertaining journey into the heart of darkness.",

Emily Blunt does a good job as the protagonist we relate to but the most interesting character was Benicio Del Toro's character Alejandro. He was the most exciting character to watch and he was the one who actually had an objective and took action to pursue it while Emily Blunt was just along for the ride.

Its a very emotional and dark role that she absolutely killed, showing new range in her talents.  Josh Brolin has only convinced me of his acting abilities in the past, but it's always nice to see him give another great performance.  He captures all the subtle characteristics about his character that make him unique, and we always get a feeling he is more than he appears.  Benicio Del Toro is the man who steals the show here, giving his best performance in years.  His dark, ghost-like performance is unnerving and took me completely by surprise.  Unraveling the puzzle of this man was a beautiful little mystery and his performance, and character, were the best in the film.  The writing was fantastic, giving us a great and layered story about the hunt for a cartel kingpin and the lengths these people will go to find him.  It was a great way to present its themes of morality, control, fear and more.  I will admit that sometimes the film could drag, but it was never boring.  Sicario is an excellent film and one of the best of the year, delivering a brilliantly styled and intense thrillers mixed with a fantastic",

Benecio Del Toro knocks it out of the park with a dark performance that is striking in it's understated power. Emily Blunt proves solid as our lead character, who manages to give a fine performance despite having a slightly underdeveloped character. Josh Brolin proves himself great as always too, giving a charismatically unsettling performance. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous with Roger Deakins doing an (as per usual) fantastic job, particularly with his use of lighting in the nighttime scenes of the film. The soundtrack, by composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson works well as the glue holding the film together, with perhaps his most haunting soundtrack to date. It cannot be understated, the soundtrack for this film is superb.This is a dark film, with an incredibly consistent tone which successfully evokes unease; haunting in it's elusiveness.

The scope, the cinematography, the production design, the score, and especially the cast; were massively stunning.\n\nVilleneuve was executing Taylor Sheridan's script (he's the actor from Sons of Anarchy and this was his debut script) with such precision. The blocking for every climax (owh yes, there were so many climax in this one) were immaculate. I especially loved the border ambush that involved thousands of cars and extras, and shot beatifully by veteran Roger Deakins. J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson was giving another soul of this movie with his intense beat. While Joe Walker edited the film seamlessly.\n\nKudos for Emily Blunt for another strong leading role. And most kudos for Benicio del Toro for being one of the most subtle and ambiguous character in recent years. The subtlety and ambiguity which always been a trademark of Villeneuve's works.\n\nAnd that was what made Sicario a strong movie with strong characters. It's a heart-thumping, mind-blowing, and intense cinematic experience with a strong execution full of great performances. Sicario surely one of the best and strongest movie I've watched this year.

Though this film is violen perhaps unnecessarily so at times, I also applaud it for its realism. Mexico is a hostile country where nihilism abounds and its every man for himself. The movie conveys that ideology and shows that not everything in politics can be a pretty picture. Call it senseless if you will, but this film is ambitious and honest enough to accurately portray the dog eat dog world that the cartel run country is. Nothing is held back.

No one's winning the war; there are no good guys; the situation is bleak. Sheridan's script provides scarce little character development, leaving a fantastic cast with shallow archetypes (the morale compass, the evil drug baron, the man out for revenge) who strictly stick to form. There is none of the detailed character study of Traffic here, no real unforeseen twists, everything plays out exactly as you imagine. Despite some fantastic elements, Sicario left me surprisingly unengaged emotionally.

The third act seems like a different movie and makes the narrative as a whole  seem confusing. Still I highly recommend this film and think that you recommend it to others.",

A drug cartel related story in the borderland between US and Mexico, CIA, FBI, local police, special forces, and all kinds of things in between. Gang members, dead and alive, smugglers, illegal immigrants, young and old. All in the violent and scary setting where death is never far. Nothing is black and white, it is all various shades of grey (more than 50, I am sure!) where things you thought were wrong are necessary and somehow just right. Emily Blunt has come far from the Devilish assistant and in addition, the film posts talent and eye candy in the form of Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin.\n\nTo note, this director has done other super films, such as Prisoners and Incendies. Both highly recommended, maybe even more than this one. Especially Incendies has stayed in my mind. Not many films do!",

Not only did it look great but it has a stellar cast and a pretty great director. The film stars Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin. The director, Denis Villeneuve, directed Prisoners back in 2013 which was one of my favorite films of that year and probably of all time. He also directed Enemy which came out last year and although I didn't love it like Prisoners it was still a film worth seeing and very interesting. Roger Deakins, who has worked on films such as Prisoners, Skyfall, and No Country For Old Men, is the Cinematographer for Sicario and it really shows, giving us many breath taking scenes.\n\nI really can't say how glad I am that Sicario didn't disappoint. I loved this film. It's my favorite film of 2015 so far. The story was interesting and kept you on the edge of your seat the entire 2 hours. The cinematography was breathtaking. The directing was incredible. The acting was award worthy. The score was chilling. If you haven't seen this movie yet you need to go right away. I know a lot of people are seeing The Martian this weekend and while it might be good, Sicario is fucking great.\n\nThe three things that stood out the most to me in Sicario was the cinematography, the score, and Benicio Del Toro. The score by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson was absolutely amazing and definitely added so much to the film. Emily Blunt clearly plays the lead in this film and she is great but the actor/character that steals the show is Del Toro. His character is interesting and demands your attention while he's on screen. If he doesn't get an academy award nomination this year I'll not only be surprised but incredibly upset. Out of the films I've seen so far I would nominate Blunt for Best Actress as well but that could change as I see more movies during award season. Josh Brolin is also in this film and does great in his role.",

At some point I thought she'd assist in making the mission a success, never happens. Loved the border scene, was expecting that kind of tension more often.

This drug cartel story isn't ripped from today's headlines.  No, it's bigger than that.  Much bigger. \"Sicario\" is an electrifying action thriller that enlightens and educates us on the violent crime that already exists-and operates-inside our southern border.\n\nEmily Blunt (\"Edge of Tomorrow\") plays a na\u00efve FBI agent and tops off a superb cast that includes Academy Award winner Benicio del Toro (\"Traffic\", 2000) as a government consultant, and Oscar-nominated Josh Brolin (for 2008's \"Milk\") as the leader of a U.S. clandestine unit.  The trio meet along the blurred desert border of corruption, deception and hitmen to fight drug lords and a jurisdiction system that still tilts in favor of the criminal minds.\n\nThe frustrated Blunt wants to play by the rule of law. Except the only U.S. move left is to flip the game board upside down--creating chaos and noise in a cartel family monopoly.\n\nAn astonishing cast and script is bookended by a spectacular music score.  A heart-pounding film experience on the frontlines, where rules get thrown aside without apology or trepidation.  \"Sicario\" is not about curbing the drug war by the time the credits roll. It's about savvy street smarts and keen instincts necessary in a dangerous environment where nothing is as it appears to be. One of the best films of 2015.\n\nGrade: A+",

            "content": "[10/3/15] Oh, boy. Where do I even begin? \"Sicario\" is a tense thriller that follows Emily Blunt as an FBI agent who volunteers to join, well, umm, we're not really sure and neither is she. Josh Brolin is this chill, laid-back dude who's forming a team with Benicio del Toro's character, but it becomes clear that there's more to both of their characters than what they say. At first, the operation seems simple based on the first 10 minutes: \"okay, so these three are after some cartel in Juarez. Big deal.\" It's not nearly that simple. I'll repeat this again, we don't really know who's working with who and what the legal parameters of their actions are--is Blunt's character working with mercenaries, rogue agents, the DEA, the CIA, a different cartel, and at times, it seems like she's signed up to work alongside all of them. It's not a confusing plot [I'm typing that in case you're thinking, oh, it's one of those 'I'm not following this movie at all' type of films. No, it's just a lot of strings being pulled simultaneously]. \"Sicario\" touches a lot on the current situation in Mexico--since it's set in the border region--with the drug cartels and the violence, I mean, when you watch this you're literally getting a taste, just a taste, of what's going on down there. Every minute/hour/what have you. Of everyday. And at times, just the film's handling of the content is terrifying, terrifying because in the back of my mind I know that the cartel violence in real life is much worse. And for the people down there, that's their reality. Gunshots, torture, drugs, etc--that's some kid's lullaby to get him/her to sleep. To counter the more graphic content, the film gives us a few scenes where a character's relationship with his son is highlighted (because we find out that the father is delivering drugs). What I liked most about those father-son scenes is that it's a subtle way of saying \"not everyone who works with the cartels does so because they're born evil. They're doing that to feed their families,\" doesn't make it right, sure, but it offers some perspective given the father's occupation. It hints at a greater message, I think, and I don't think the father would be involved at all if circumstances were different. If the country wasn't such a disaster. If his salary were better, etc. And I know I'm going off a tangent, the film is well-directed, it's well-acted, there's a few action scenes that put you right in the freakin' middle of all the chaos--it's great--and even if you're not completely impressed by the movie--\"Sicario\" definitely gets you thinking about the film and the Drug War in general. Take the fact that we get this really cool scene, sorry SPOILERS, in thermal vision as Brolin, del Toro, and Blunt's team sneaks into Mexico through a tunnel used by the cartels. Now we know that in real life, there IS cooperation between U.S Intelligence and the Mexican Government. Do events like those that unfold in the film happen [U.S forces going into Mexico to take down the cartels, in a way, committing acts of war] in reality? If it did, they'd probably have the approval of the Mexican government anyways. But what about all of that surveillance and technology that we're using on our side and also sending down the Mexicans, how are we not finding these big cartel leaders more easily? Should we even be getting involved, I mean, we already are, but should we be playing such a big role considering Mexico's infamy with corruption and bribery? Those are just some things I'd like to know. Perhaps the most thought-provoking part about the movie happens right at the end. There's a soccer game, we see the kids playing, the moms are there trying to forget about the environment's insanity...and then the gunshots start from a distance. One might say, \"wait a minute, I want to see what's going on.\" The truth is we already saw what we needed to see. It's a giant question mark and it concerns the youth, which in turn, concerns the future. Right now, there are no answers or realistic solutions, and that's kind of how I'd describe \"Sicario\"--it's a film that makes you ask and ask ...but gives you no answers [per se].",

            "content": "After Prisoners and Enemy in back to back years, two of the more thought provoking films of the past few years, I have been awaiting Denis Villeneuve's next project.  Of course, Emily Blunt is my favorite actress right now, so in my mind the two of them were enough to get Sicario on my most anticipated list for 2015.  I can assure you, the film doesn't letdown.  Sicario is about an FBI agent, played by Blunt, who is brought along by a government task force to help on the border of Mexico and the U.S. as drug cartels rule the area.\n\nOne of the most chilling parts about Sicario is its realistic nature.  I had a Zero Dark Thirty vibe in that it doesn't hold back in its brutality.  They both have a brilliant female lead as well, although much different characters by motive.  Blunt is complemented by Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin as the main three agents.  Part of the greatness of Sicario is its cast but I think the marketing was a bit misleading.  We are led to believe that Blunt is the central focus of the story, but there is almost as much if not more of Del Toro than anyone else here.  It's both good and bad.  I was looking forward to seeing Blunt as the integral part of the story, but Del Toro was just as good.  \n\nI think the real star of the film is Roger Deakins, the director of photography.  He once again gives an incredibly beautiful looking film through his award winning cinematography.  Even though this film may fail to get any acting nominations or any ofthe other big awards, I think it's safe to say that Deakins is a lock for cinematography.  It's his panning shots of the border along with J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's score that give the film an eerie and ominous feel.  \n\nIt's very difficult to talk about any details without spoiling anything, but I can say that it's a really good movie.  I was reading a review that talked about the intensity of a scene before the intensity really begins, if that makes sense.  It wasn't the gunshots or explosions that gave me chills.  It was the quiet calm scenes before the storm.  It's not the mind bender that Enemy was nor the shocker that was Prisoners, but Sicario is one of the most beautifully shot and well acted films this year.\n\n+Blunt can do no wrong\n\n+Eerie score\n\n+Deakins' cinematography\n\n+Brutally real\n\n+Very very very intense\n\n9.0/10",

At the same time, the movie intentionally keeps you in the dark, putting you in the same company as the lead, Emily Blunt. It gets frustrating, but that's part of the movie. Sicario drew a fine line between very good movie and dud, but comes through toward the end to be a very good movie. This is a solid script and is well directed. It's incredibly violent, but not just for violence's sake. Blunt's character seems a bit too whiny in the beginning, but it ends up being necessary for the movie to work.\n\nFor people who have a solid idea of \"good vs. evil,\" Sicario will seem like nothing more than Hollywood entertainment. The fact that there is a middle ground, or more people are on the \"evil\" side of things that one would think, could cause more people to think about what's going on and may be a catalyst for many a discussion on the reality of America's involvement in the illegal drug trade.\n\nEmily Blunt is an entertaining actress, and Josh Brolin is on top of his game as the casual DoD agent. I firmly believe that Benicio Del Toro should be in every movie made, and he reinforces why in Sicario. \n\nSicario is worth spending money on, whether you go to the theater or a rent.",

Kate is assigned to a special elite task force led by its leader Matt, played superbly by Josh Brolin, to help in the never ending bloody battles against the insidious Mexican drug cartels, she crosses into Mexico on a clandestine mission into a lawless border area where headless corpses of murdered victims dangle from highway overpasses, with her mysterious mostly silent team companion Alejandro, a special \"consultant\" with a tragic past, played terrifically by a scene-stealing Benicio Del Toro. Kate will find soon question everything she believes in and her faith will be tested as the operation continues, in a land where anyone is a potential target or perpetrator. To say anymore about this film is to betray its sense of paranoia. Astute direction by Villeneuve, with magnificent pulse-pounding action-set pieces that are brutally intense and memorable. A taut script by Taylor Sheridan, Roger Deakin's ravishing sun-parched cinematography is very impressive, and Johann Johannsson's grandiose haunting score is superb. \"Sicario\" which means \"hitman\" in Spanish is a most remarkable motion picture in every sense of the word.

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve is perhaps one of the most exciting directors to come into a more public eye; not that Villeneuve is a new director as he's directed several films already, but his growing popularity is getting him better and better jobs. Villeneuve has now taken on the drug trade of all things and has turned what could've been just a have been a great thriller film and has turned it into something more, he has us question the moralities of law enforcement not so much as a good cop vs bad cop but rather as the one who does it the \"right\" way and the one who breaks the rules willingly and regularly in order to get better results. Which is right? Which is better? Sicario isn't so much about answering it but portraying both sides and asking us to question what's right, and then threatens you with reality. Emily Blunt's Kate's crisis of morality and personal belief is brought out by Blunt's fantastic work, it's not the kind of performance that gives you grand scenes to quote, but an embodiment of a person and losing yourself to the role. Benicio Del Toro's almost polar opposite Alejandro shows the other side and is brought on by one of the veteran actor's best performances in years. His calm, cold, tactile demeanor and dead eyes convey more to us than even the most wordy of main characters. These two performances rocket Sicario's questions of morality into frame and never let up even at the end it's not entirely clear, but it's left up for the viewer to decide. It's a film that is so beautifully directed and equally haunting in it's content that it creates a brilliant contrast of beautiful horrors that actually could make Sicario one of the best horror films of this year. So utterly disturbing and yet for everything that we are more aware of and think of, it's almost like the film's just scratching the surface but we ourselves have to see how much is under that scratch itself. The result is one of the absolute best films so far this year, simply unmissable, even if it will make your ethics boil and your stomach churn",

            "content": "Sicario is Spanish for hitman. In film lingo that makes it sensational viewing, a gripping and action-packed foray into America's War on Drugs. French-Canadan filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners), working from a dense, heart-shattering script from Taylor Sheridan, is out to fry your nerves. Mission accomplished.\n\nThe film starts off a little opaque and convoluted but hang on. Just follow along with audience surrogate Kate Macer, played by a killer good Emily Blunt. Macer is an FBI field agent and Blunt gives her a tough core that is unforgettable. If Edge of Tomorrow didn't convince you of Blunt's inherent badass-ness, Sicario should.\n\nWe first meet Kate in Arizona, raiding a hideout run by a Mexican drug cartel, a house with decomposing corpses stuffed into the walls. Kate is largely unflappable till she's essentially ordered to volunteer for an agency-merging task force that seeks to pit one drug lord against another.\n\nSound confusing? Just sit back and absorb, basically the same advice Kate gets from operations chief Matt Graver (a stellar, smarmy Josh Brolin), a laid-back man of manipulations clad in sandals who claims to be working a defense contract but in all likelihood is CIA. His associate Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-Mexican-prosecutor-turned-assassin who may have a larger personal agenda. You can basically see it in his intense stare. Oscar-winner Del Toro is tremendous here, giving off a toxic mix of smoldering cool and menace that throws even Kate off her game.\n\nSicario is all build-up for a stunning climax set in a world where right and wrong, good and bad, are no longer absolutes. As Kate fights to stand her moral ground as the ground beneath her perpetually shifts, Villeneuve expertly stages on gut-wrenching action scene after another, all set to a mirthful, jittery score by Johan Johannsson. All praise as well to cinematographer Roger Deakins whose aerial shots of a white-knuckle border crossing stands in vivid contrast with a tense tunnel chase. It's a visual knockout. But the real miracles of the film are all written on Blunt's expressive face. It's pure poetry and it's dark. You won't know what hit you.",

            "content": "Director Denis Villeneuve is not one to shy away from the darkest aspects of human nature. While far be it from me to call the plot of his films inconsequential, the setting is merely a catalyst to show what humans are capable of when pushed to the brink of their capabilities. He keeps his filmed honed and resolute, with minimal scoring, sparse and economical  characterization, and an unhurried narrative. It worked brilliantly for a movie like Prisoners, but for Sicario, the results are underwhelming. And due to the relaxed delivery of the story, it wasn't until the second act that I realized Sicario wasn't going to deliver on the narratives promises. My frustrations are centered on the screenplay. First time writer Taylor Sheridan made a name for himself as David Hale in Sons of Anarchy, a series which lasted 7 seasons and 95 episodes, so he isn't accustomed to concluding a story in just over two hours. And this is where Sicario falters; The script meanders along the narrative, which puts you in a relaxed mindset, but spontaneous bout of ultra-suspense, and a plot with too many webs to follow puts Sicario at odds with itself. It tries to be too many things; a character study, an expose on drug cartels, a nail-biting thriller, an unhurried arthouse film. The best films in history have been able to have multiple personalities, so this is not impossible, but Taylor Sheridan is too green of a screenwriter to pull it off. As a result, Sicario is decent at many things, but superb at nothing. If by some miracle this review reaches Taylor Sheridan, I have a lesson for him;  A story doesn't need to tie up all (or even any) of its loose ends as long as it has a point. The moral of your story is the driving principle - the lesson an audience takes away once the credits roll and the dust settles. 'Love conquers all', 'Teens often make bad decisions', 'Don't walk across the wood at night.' That kind of thing. Decide on the moral of your story and use it to drive the action. Be aware of the contract between you and your audience. Everything that happens must happen for a reason, and the more of a big deal you make of an event, the bigger the pay off must be.",

Denis Villeneuve's intense new film SICARIO (which means hit man in Spanish) takes us into the tactical underbelly of those cryptic individuals who carry out US policy decisions \"from on high\",  cloaked in legitimacy, though they are prohibited maneuvers that would be considered illegal in any court of law.\n\nThe atmosphere is beautifully filmed - either pale, washed out ochers depicting the long dusty border between US and Mexico, or the rich deep blues and blacks of the evening with night - vision goggles irradiating the world around them into skeletal images. Put a young, female FBI agent into this mix - Emily Blunt as Kate, a dedicated officer, former head of a kidnap-response unit based in Phoenix, who is forced to question all that she has practiced and been taught in the Bureau; her fiercely held personal values are turned upside down by the reality of being recruited into the midst of anti- cartel \"warriors\" who can behave as dark and dirty as their enemy - the drug lords that  control the populous by murdering and slaughtering men, women and children, stringing up body parts hanging them from electricity wires like abandoned baggage on clothes-lines.\n\nTransporting, manufacturing,  shipping and controlling the wildly lucrative  drug industry necessitates making alliances - everyone is  corruptible from the dealers to the federales  and police on both sides of the border - all partaking of the spoils, while their interior sentiments become ghosts evaporating into the surroundings. \"It is not personal\" are words that exemplify the cool calculations of those in power whose humanity has been shredded, and who barricade themselves with bodyguards and fancy homes from the brutality that they inflict on nameless people.\n\nKate and her FBI partner ( a good performance by Daniel Kaluuya) are the two newcomers brought along on a mission that they were not briefed on - so the \"fog of war\" is indeed literally murky. Everything becomes clear with time, but meanwhile we in the audience are as mystified as the protagonists. We meet a team of hardened DEA operatives with Josh  Brolin as Matt - the wise-cracking, gum chewing leader who is a cipher, offhandedly refusing to respond with a straight answer to any question put before him. Despite his Cheshire-like grin, there is a man beneath the lumbering, impenetrable veneer who is callously determined to fulfill the U.S. government's calculated goals no matter the toll.\n\nBenicio Del Toro is the \"star\" of SICARO, brilliant as the mercenary Alejandro - a person whose face reveals little, but whose eyes and body language betray a passionate resolve for revenge, and a history of incomparable  pain and suffering at the hands of the drug-lords becoming a person for hire with no longer a \"soul\" to lose. He is the \"enforcer,\" expert at torture and killing, yet despite his horrific activities, every moment he is on the screen it is filled with his abundant presence and an acute sense of heartache. \n\n\nKate's sojourn from an idealistic FBI agent to an awareness of the brutal realities of the contaminated policies used by the United States to combat the  \"drug war\" is a bit naive and inconclusive. We sense that she remains a staunch believer in the underlying principle of the \"rule of law\", but we know all-too-well that she is standing on shaky grounds.",

He's someone who knows what he is and is okay with and is Del Toro's best performance since \"Traffic\" (in many ways, this is a spiritual sequel to that movie).  Behind the camera, Villeneuve directs Taylor Sheridan's gritty script to near-perfection, keeping the action moving while giving you enough character moments to make you care.  Plus, while not preached outright, there is a nice ant-drug war message in the sense that in order to fight monsters like the drug cartels, you'll have to employ a monster to do so, and if you don't like that, maybe this isn't a war worth fighting.

She plays an FBI agent caught up in a shady CIA operation (is that a redundancy?) in Juarez. Her struggle with gradual corruption of the spirit is what makes this work so well.

Well Sicario has a theory of all things mentioned above, one may say its a conspiracy theory etc but like they say there is no smoke without a fire.But all withstanding, what I saw on screen felt like a true story, and it was thought provoking. Sicario is a dark, and eerie tale about what happens just a couple miles away from the American border in Mexico. Daily many innocents Mexicans die due to the cartel drug war. And Sicario highlights the cruel killings, and how one needs to combat the drug lords. \n\nRarely do you see a film that from the first frame not only does it engage you but it takes you into the nail biting action which is happening on screen.Numerous times I had my heart pounding, and jaw on the ground from action and suspense unfolding on the screen. Simply put Sicario has the best performances, and dialogues I have seen in a film this year. Film of the year? Well its in contention for sure.\n\nStory wise the film talks about the escalating drug war the Cartel are engaging in on American soil. After FBI agent Kate Macer invades a house in Arizona and finds about 40 dead bodies which are collateral from the Cartel drug war, she is recruited by the a government agency to take down the real players of the drug war. This agency is\nlead by two men Matt Graver, and Alejandro a columbian man. These two men target Manuel Diaz because he can lead them to the kingpin of the cartel because he is right hand man of the kingpin( Diaz lives in the USA, and fronts as a business man). After arresting Diaz's brother Guillermo on Mexico soil in a operation, he leads them to a tunnel used to transport drugs from Mexico to the US.How this tunnel leads to Manuel, and his boss is what forms the rest of the plot.\n\nActing wise Benicio Del Toro is just mindblowing good, I thought Johnny Depp for Black Mass was the best performance of the year, but Del Toro gives him a good match. A oscar worthy performance for sure. Josh Brolin is superb. And Emily Blunt is fantastic, she shoulders the film at many junctions.\n\nIts difficult to find any negatives in  Sicario, because even the smallest details have been dealt with beautifully. The films pacing is a bit slow, but the concluding 30-45 are adrenal pumping no stop thrill and action, so that makes up for any pacing issues. Sicario being such a great film has many positives them being the dialouges, espically the ones mouthes by Del Toro,two dialogues in particular where \"time to meet god\", and \"the wolves are taking over, and you wont be able to live with wolves so leave\"(in the context of the film, there are mind blowing). Secondly the films acting which i mentioned above. Finally the film is the definition of what a perfect action thriller must be, the film is extremely detailed, its has a dark atmosphere, the way the film highlights the cartel violence, and how the americans have a hand in the drug trade, is also handled perfectly. In short in Sicario content is king, and the script and screenplay are amazing. A special mention for the absolute amazing pre-climax sequence, i got my tickets worth in just those final minutes.\n\nOverall over the years Denis Villenue has become one of my favourite directors, and with Sicario he only solidifies his title. The film is a must watch, because if you don't watch it now, you will after seeing its oscar nomination list because its just that good.\n\n4.5/5* or 9/10",

            "content": "Think of Denis Villeneuve\u00e2??s \u00e2??Sicario\u00e2?? as a simple predator-prey situation. The film is a snake who has just gazed upon its prey and is waiting to attack it, whereas we, the audience, are like a chameleon who does not know what\u00e2??s coming for it. It does not know that there is a camouflaged snake nearby waiting to attack, and then when the snake strikes, it is so poisonous that it changes colors. Yes, Sicario is one of those movies that will stay in your mind for a good couple of hours after finishing it, and it will also change your perspective on some matters.\n\nSicario, as you might expect, is about the war on drug trafficking and the cartels that operate between the US and the Mexican border. It follows a starry-eyed but fearless FBI agent (Emily Blunt) who begins to partake in a government task force that targets drug lords and their liaisons in the US and across the border. Beneath this dense storyline, there is a fantastic cast, and most of them give their best performance of their career. Emily Blunt gives her best performance to date as a naive agent who still believes that written rules will keep criminals from doing terrible things, however simultaneously wants to feel safe in a world where corruption happens in every corner, disguised as many different forms. Her performance is riveting and stiff, and it makes her character even more interesting and engaging. Benicio del Toro also gives a haunting performance as the puzzling and cold agent who does all the dirty work for the task force. Josh Brolin is a wonder too as the leader of the operation who is just as arrogant as they come.\n\nAll aspects of production are incredible. First and foremost is the dusty, sometimes-pretty-sometimes-ugly cinematography by Roger Deakins, which is just jarring and beautiful (remember though, that something ugly can be aesthetically beautiful). It allocates the viewer at a quite distant position from the characters, the scene, and therefore the plot itself, and it makes the film experience as impersonal as it can be, all with good reason, since Villeneuve and Deakins are keeping us in the dark in complete symmetry with Emily Blunt\u00e2??s character. There are shots in this film that I will never forget (e.g. the shot where the agents\u00e2?? silhouette disappear one by one with the breathtaking sunset in the background). It does not only capture the emotional coldness and aloofness of the characters but it captures the dust, the grime of the world. The score by J\u00c3\u00b3hann J\u00c3\u00b3hannsson works in concordance with the cinematography and makes everything even more intense, most especially with the hellish cues and introductory shots of Ciudad Ju\u00c3\u00a1rez, one of Mexico\u00e2??s most dangerous cities.\n\nThe film is the perfect combination of pulse-pounding suspense and stealthiness, which reminded me of the style of Kathryn Bigelow\u00e2??s Zero Dark Thirty. Sicario is so engaging, that I did not look at my watch throughout the film; the movie just flashed by. Let\u00e2??s not forget that Villeneuve is so good at making his films flow really well, but always with a touch of subtlety; something he has done repeatedly and can be felt in Incendies (2010) and Enemy (2013). Taylor Sheridan\u00e2??s script destroys the binaries that are always ascribed to the problem of the cartels and drug trafficking by using straight-forward dialogue and beautiful story progression to let us know (for those who did not know it already) how drug trade works and how the concept of corruption is more grey than black and white.\n\nOverall, Sicario\u00e2??s harshness about geopolitics, the human condition, and crime will stir up some physiological effects on you, which is exactly what makes it worth watching. And most importantly, it explores how little by little, sociopolitical and economic factors and the media have moved us into a phase of crime desensitization, especially in unstable regions like the US-Mexican border. One of the best films I\u00e2??ve seen this year.",

It's a difficult role to play because anyone in it is going to be conflicted between FBI legalistic mind-set and the atrocities of the cartels.

All the time, we hear\u00a0a low bass beat that, to me, at first, sounded annoyingly like music from the theater next door. It's persistent and grating, and then suddenly we are in the bright sunlight of Arizona, along for the ride as an FBI squad prepares to take down some drug dealers. They burst into a generic house, exchange gunfire, and then, once the dust settles, discover, within the walls of that house, the stuff of nightmares. Our guide throughout this tight, masterful adrenaline-fueled sequence is Kate Macer, the leader of the federal team, and tough as she is, even she can't comprehend the horrors they discover. The guys they're dealing with make Gus Fring in \"Breaking Bad\" look like an amateur.\n\nSo far, so terrifying. Kate is played by the terrific English actress (and new American citizen) Emily Blunt (\"Edge of Tomorrow\"), who, ever since\u00a0\"The Young Victoria,\" in 2009, has proven, time and again, that she is worthy of our undivided attention when on screen. Here her character holds all of the promise of her earlier dynamic roles: she's smart, fearless, and extremely capable. She's also driven by a powerful internal force to catch the men creating havoc in her border town.\n\nBut then the movie gets in the way, and we lose sight of the great qualities of Blunt, the actress, and Kate, the FBI agent. I've seen two previous films by Denis Villeneuve:\u00a0\"Incendies\" and\u00a0\"Prisoners.\" I found the former to be a brilliant meditation on the cycle of violence in the Middle East;\u00a0the latter attempted to be a film about the cycle of violence within each of us, but ended up just being an exercise in violence. Villeneuve has bold ideas, and is a fine visualist, but sometimes cannot control his impulses towards quasi-torture porn. Sadly, here we are more in the territory of\u00a0\"Prisoners\" than\u00a0\"Incendies.\"\n\nThat is not to say that the film has nothing going for it. Shortly after that terrific opening, Kate is recruited by a shadowy upper-government organization, headed by the always watchable Josh Brolin (starring right now in\u00a0\"Everest,\" as well), and before long finds herself across the border, in Mexico, on the Bridge of the Americas\u00a0with her new team, bringing a drug lord back into the United States for questioning. She doesn't know why she's there or what she's supposed to do. But when all hell breaks loose - in another solid bit of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne - she acts, saving herself and at least one other member of the\u00a0group, Alejandro - a man of mysterious origin - played by Benicio Del Toro (\"Savages\") with initial gravitas and wit that, sadly, evaporates later in the movie.\n\nWe have a great setup: idealistic young agent, recruited to catch the \"real bad guys,\" finds herself asked to commit acts she deems illegal. Will she sell her soul for the higher purpose (as it's put to her)? Will that be the central conflict, the war within herself? That would have been interesting. Instead, what we get for two hours is Kate's constant na\u00efvet\u00e9 about the nature of the work that governments do to fight crime. She is shocked - SHOCKED - to find lawbreaking here. And shocked again. And again! To which I answer: really? What a bore you are. Instead, then, of an evenly matched duel between her and Alejandro (who turns out to have very specific motivations of his own), we get a rabbit facing off against a tiger. No contest. And very little drama. Such initial promised squandered.",

I will start with the story which is clich\u00e9 but it's also indomitably told in real time. I know a handful of movies that use flashbacks to tell the story but this one doesn't and I enjoy that fact. I will say this much about the story that it's about an FBI agent tasked with helping a non-disclosed agency take down a Cartel. I will now move onto the acting which brought there A-Game for sure. The cast is incredibly strong with Emily Blunt,Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro being the main three characters. They are all fascinating but Del Toro in my opinion blows the movie out of the water with his character. They all have fantastic rapport. I will now move onto the action which while this isn't a Michael Bay movie the scenes that do take place are on point with excruciating detail that it boarders realism. The scenes are violent and bloody and are meant to invoke a certain feeling of awe and dread simultaneously. I must also talk about the cinematography which was done by Roger Deakins who is a mastermind when it comes to the angles and etc of the film and it's absolutely Phenomenal in every aspect and it brings the movie to life and the sounds of everything in the movie from the gunfire to the city aspect will leave you transfixed onto the screen. The banter between the characters including the Delta Force Operators is impeccably done. The director Denis Villeneuve was terrific and I applaud him for such a powerhouse of a motion picture. I will finish by saying this is my new favorite movie of 2015 which prior was \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" but this takes the whole bakery. I would recommend watching this movie without a doubt. A Masterpiece rapped in a bow.",

The real depth is given to Benicio Del Toro's Colombian character whose presence constantly evokes a sense of uneasiness in every scene he is in. If you're expecting a hero's journey type of film, or anything resembling a traditional redemption tale then throw those expectations out the window.

The more that is revealed, the further we descend into this horrific world and the greater the tension grows. This is one of those rare films where you'll find yourself forgetting to breathe and blink.\n\nDenis Villeneuve has just proved to be the most powerful director working in thrillers today. Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy and now Sicario. There is magic between Villeneuve, cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson.\n\nSicario grabs you from the opening scene, like an invisible hand that reaches inside your rib cage and squeezes. Just when you think it has let go to give you a little break, it suddenly squeezes harder than ever, forcing all the oxygen out of your lungs. It's not exactly a fun experience, it's a shockingly real thrill ride that takes you further than you expect these kinds of films to take you.

            "content": "THERE COULDN'T A BETTER WAY TO DIRECT AN OLD MATERIAL! - TWO THUMBS UP, WAY UP!\n\nThere is sequence during the middle of the movie that has a team of US Army Delta Force, CIA, and Mexican Drug Enforcement Agency guys entering the crime zone of a dangerous city in Mexico. These are about 4 to 5 vehicles. They going to extract a drug world kingpin for interrogation and take him to US Soil. This is such an intense sequence, visually from cars moving in and out of US/Mexican Border to local police joining to escort them, and then it ends with a gunfight upon return.\n\nAll of it sounds familiar or old material. Yeah, right but when you see it you will realize that an old material only handled differently creates an experience we call, tour de force movie making. This is pure example of method directing. Sicario's story line initially presents itself as a tired material seen hundreds of times, but the way it makes you feel about it by Denis Villenueve's Direction, cinematographer and actors is unimaginable. \n\nWhat am I trying to say, for example in the sequence I mentioned earlier, these cars are filled with macho, good looking, brawny US Forces and Mexican Drug Enforcement, you hear them rant and laugh during the whole sequence. You are thinking that few of them will sure get killed while in a gunfight that could possibly be approaching any minute. But by the time the particular scene ends, yes with a gunfight, you realize that all of them are thoughtful and not trigger happy conventional thriller movie's supporting characters. They handle the situation as if they understand that all of them need to get alive out of this situation. They feel same even for the bad guys.\n\nThis sequence actually laid the foundation of how the rest of the movie is going to be and especially what you are going to experience in the third act. This one kept topping itself and pulse pounding throughout the course of 2 hours. \n\nEmily Blunt character starts out as FBI Agent working on kidnapping case gets enlisted by government task force. She is up for it but not prepared for what she will know as the operation will near its end. This movie articulately handles the cost of war on drugs and its effect on life of an average Mexican and many Americans. How a Non Civil Government Agencies and Military Forces have high interest in War on Drugs and uses or misuse all the resources that are within or not under their jurisdiction to win this war.\n\nEmily Blunt and Benecio Del Toro characters are at the center of all of this. These are best and Oscar Worthy performances we have seen to date this year. There is something so weird and scary about Benicio Del Toro playing the seemingly sinister character with some sort of Mexican Drug Cartel connections. But he is the one that keeps us guessing is he the bad guy or the good? And believe me he does it till the very last. His breakthrough performance was The USUAL SUSPECTS (1995), supporting but memorable performance in SNATCH (2000), Oscar Winning role in TRAFFIC (2001) and my all-time favorite, THE HUNTED (2003), he has never looked back since then. His mannerism while playing such characters makes you an instant fan of his work.\n\nEmily Blunt's character however has an edge to it. She wants to do the right things but yet remained involved in whatever wrong is going on around her. She is suspicious right from the beginning but gives in to the hope that she is going to nail the bad guy. She is careful and brave, midway during the movie we see her behave like an every female character that needs to be rescued, but the very last scene pays off by telling that she has courage to do what is needed but also understands the cost associated with it. So she may or may not do what seems right according to her idealist approach.\n\nI was also amazed by the cinematography and minimum use of background score. There are cinematographers that capture an exotic location beautifully and then there are Visual Artists like Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country of Old Men) that makes you feel that the landscape we are watching are the characters in the movie. This cinematographer captures the barren, crime filled, god forsaken land in a way less seen in crime thrillers. \n\nAt few point during the movie the characters speak so slow that we barely hear them, but then as the movies progresses, we realize that these are people who are very much aware of the consequences of what they may or may not say and it will ultimately affect the outcome they foresee.\n\nLike I said from the beginning till the end the movie makes you keep guessing what is going to become of the story, you are waiting for a bad guy to be revealed, but movie takes an unconventional way in explaining why each of the character is doing whatever they are doing. \n\nThis one comfortably takes one of the slots among my top 10 movies this year. What an amazing movie experience.",

The movie follows a team of FBI agents, as well as some others, but I'm not really all-knowing about this sort of stuff, who are trying to uncover the biggest cartel business in Juarez. Emily Blunt plays a very careful agent who tries to do everything by the book and when she's given an opportunity to help other agents to infiltrate this cartel, she immediately accepts the offer, but what she doesn't know is that the people she agreed to help are people who don't do anything by the book and are keeping secrets from her. That's the story in short, I don't explain stories very well in these reviews, but I feel like I have to... Anyways, the story is very intriguing and I was hooked from the very beginning. There are many disturbing and brutal scenes that will leave you breathless! The ending is, especially, unsettling. And while it does at times seem like it's something you've already seen before, you certainly won't think that once you see the ending. The acting was fantastic! Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt are the absolute best in this movie! Benicio Del Toro's character is very mysterious and has a very dark past and once you find out his actual intentions, you're gonna be quite surprised. Emily Blunt's character, on the other hand, seems like one of the only reasonable characters in the entire movie. The movie looks terrific! The entire movie has this orange/sepia sort of filter and it really works well with the scenes. All in all, one of the better movies this year and one certainly worth watching!",

Denis Villeneuve expertly directs, creating an atmosphere that swings from dark and disturbing to epic beauty.

The first scene is her leading a bust on, what is thought to be a kidnapping, but turns out to be a horror scene of Mexican drug gang related torture. Leading way out in front she is shot at, she shoots back killing her assailant and she survives without a scratch.  This is one tough and successful machine of a fighter. \n\nNext scene we get further evidence that she is a tough women at the top of her game, when the \"big boys\" are talking about how proven in the anvil of violence she is. They choose her over her partner who has done a tour of military duty, to join a taskforce to ... well we're not sure what it is to do for a very long time - but she's in because they promise her it will give her a shot at vengeance for all her dead buddies from scene 1.\n\nThen the nightmare begins! A nightmare for women sitting in the audience that is. \n\nSo begins the long and careful stripping of any agency this tough woman has. She is told nothing. \"Just sponge it up\"/learn\". Her partner pops up every now and then and insists on getting the answers, which are not given to her. She waves her hands helplessly. And yes... he just has to ask the once and they tell him.  Nice one.\n\nShe is constantly in the dark. She is positioned at the back now. It becomes clear that she is a pawn in a game she can't possibly understand, being just a girl and all. She even goes \"crying like a kid\" to her normal boss about how her new friends are breaking the rules. She's quickly slapped down and told to get back in the play pit. \n\nShe bumps around in the dark, discovering things she shouldn't see. She does get an active moment in the plot. Ah, wait, that was when the plot uses her sexuality for a major twist. She is so unappealing as a woman she hasn't had sex for \"don't ask\" how long, and she doesn't even have a frilly bra. I mean can you be a real woman without one of those?  So when a good guy turns up she's all in and it's hot and heavy pretty quickly. Only he's a bad guy, and just as she is suffocating to death with his hands around her slim throat, one of her pals from the play pit turns up to save her and it becomes obvious that they'd used her as bait to catch this bad guy. Only no one had let her in on it.\n\nThere is even a nod to a simulated rape scene, where her partner is told to lie back and enjoy it as the boss guy hauls our heroine away to rough her up and hold her down against the rocks until she stops protesting and goes quiet. \n\nAnd we twist and turn unrelentingly until the last scene where she is forced, tears running down her cheek, to sign a document that says that everything was done by the book, and hadn't been a cowboy's picnic at all.  A gun at her head, this is the final nail in the coffin of any agency she might have had. She goes against all her principles and her threat of a scene or two back that she will never let them get away with it.  Powerless and defeated, she lets them get away with it.\n\nThere's not much to love in this movie for a woman who wants to be the subject of her own life rather than the object.  So for who's pleasure is this movie constructed? Does it give men pleasure to see even the toughest of women subjugated and rendered powerless?  \n\nMy big take away. Well, there are two:\n1)\tDon't think just because you can fight like a man we'll let you be as powerful as a man. We still run the show, don't you know?\n2)\tDon't go to Juarez, Mexico! It ain't a pretty place.",

We don't need the greatest and grandest reveal of them all, but we do need something better than what we got here.\n\nThe script is a failure as well and Emily Blunt gets screwed hard because of it. Pretty huge issue since Blunt is supposed to be the lead even though the film feels like it switches to Benicio Del Toro being the lead during the climax. Blunt's performance is bad per se, but she's given so little to do and is so passive throughout most of the film that you're left wondering what she's doing here in the first place. The film does answer that last one, but it's such a weak and pathetic explanation that the fact the movie tries to play it as a shocking reveal is downright laughable.\n\nThe other actors are pretty good. Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are great, with Del Toro being the film's best performance. Other than them, nobody else really stands out.\n\nIf the film has anything going for it, it's Roger Deakins' breathtaking Cinematography. Give the man his damn Oscar already.

This is a political movie, so you get your share of talking and explaining, but these scenes are still engaging and never overstay their welcome because they feel purposeful to the story. An exhilarating sequence comes early on where the Americans attempt to arrest suspects at their cars within clogged border traffic. So nail-biting and expertly filmed was this sequence that I was worried it would be the film's peak. Not so, for it is at least equally matched in multiple sequences towards the film's end, right where the best scenes should be.\n\nRoger Deakins' cinematography might just be the star of this show, and his expertise makes the film feel like one. His skills are always present, but range from subtle to obvious. He films daylight scenes with unique brightness, giving clarity and detail to each frame, and not with contradiction to the film's dark overtones. Night scenes look incredible, especially black and lusciously detailed.  The scenes where the crew walks into the tunnel at night and when they use night vision inside are pure visual showmanship. \n\nEmily Blunt does a great job as the moral center of the film, opposed to and unprepared for the world of darkness she's entering. Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro have both crossed over this line and embody that really well. Each have their moments of subtle ferocity, but it's Del Toro's mysterious demeanor and hidden depth that make him the true standout of the cast. He feels like the king of the darkness, or as one character calls him, the ghost.\n\nThe score by Johann Johannsson is the most intense and creative I've heard this year. Softly pounding drums, deep cello drones and strings that bend downwards are distressingly tense. So are tracks like \"The Beast\" where a sort of beat is created out of rough, scratchy ambience that's crashing on itself. The sound outside of the music is fantastic as well, adding to the overall intensity. It deserves nominations for score and sound mixing.\n\nEven the use of helicopters in this film is fantastic. Sometimes we will get amazing looking helicopter shots of the action, edited expertly into the sequence that work because there are helicopters present in the action, often made present by the sound. Sometimes Johann Johannsson's score and the sounds of the helicopters blend together amazingly. \n\nSo the technicals all check out perfectly, but the film goes beyond being a merely well-crafted thriller with its political direction. It's an anti-war film at its heart, or lack thereof, exposing the corruption of the U.S government in the war on drugs. It doesn't focus quite as much on the futility as Traffic did years ago, although it's certainly there to an extent. What makes Sicario unique to the conversation is its unrelenting darkness and assault on morality. It's a must see.",

This is easily one of the best films of the year, with incredible cinematography by Roger Deakins, and a challenging screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, that manages to capture a bleak and unconventional perspective of one of the most violent issues plaguing the continent of North America.\nThe plot follows Emily Blunt's character Kate Macer, who at the start of the film is a SWAT officer trying to bust a drug kingpin's web of killers in Texas. After catching the attention of Josh Brolin, she is then brought to Juarez to help him and Del Toro's character track down the crime lord and put a stop to his operations... or so she is told by her commanding officers. The story is full of brutal scenes that show the effects of poverty, ineffective governments, and ruthless mercenaries who will do anything to complete their objective. Sicario isn't interested in painting a black and white vision of these characters and the world they live in, as every scene has you and the protagonist Kate wonder exactly with whom you should be sympathizing. \nThe short answer to that is probably nobody. The drug cartel is portrayed very bluntly as individuals willing to murder and torture to get what they want, while the governments of the United States and Mexico care less about civilian crossfire, and more about their own establishment and power. Just when I thought the film was going to end in a sequence similar to something at the climax of Zero Dark Thirty, the film suddenly went on to show the audience one of the most brutal fifteen minutes of a film I have seen in years. \nThis is a very gritty and realistic movie shot in a variety of incredible landscapes and great nighttime scenes. Nearly every frame knows exactly what to draw your attention to, and yet also what to conceal. All this helped by Benicio Del Toro giving a performance that should seriously be nominated for an Oscar, and Sicario manages to be a provocative piece of entertainment you shouldn't miss.",

Suspenseful as hell. There's a lot to recommend this film. Still, while watching it something was bothering me: for being sold as the central character of the film, particularly coming of last year's fantastic, \"Edge of Tomorrow\", and after being introduced as a highly successful FBI agent, Emily Blunt's character sure spent a lot of time acting confused and non-assertive. At one point she had to have her partner,former military, come in and ask Brolin and del Toro what the deal is. In all the operations she's involved with after being recruited by the two, it's quite clear she's does NOT belong in there, as she doesn't have any information about what's happening, yet she's there anyway. In the end, it's essentially revealed she was brought in to be the weak-willed agent who would sign off, under threat of death, on a joint CIA operation of questionable legality. BULLSHIT. They could have recruited her partner who not only is quite gung-ho, but has the necessary military training for the mission to boot, and the only reason I can see for them picking her is, \"because she's a woman.\" F*** that noise. I wanted her to shoot del Toro in the end as it would have increased my respect for the film. As it is, for everything that this film has going for it, I'm now rather annoyed at it, so I'm just going to call this one a wash.",

            "content": "MAY I BE BLUNT? - My Review of SICARIO (3 Stars)\n\nDenis Villeneuve has demonstrated an effectively slow-burning, formalist approach to filmmaking in such features as PRISONERS and ENEMY, allowing suspense to build and screws to turn slowly to ratchet up the maximum levels of tension.  In many ways, his somewhat classical style reminds me of M. Night Shyamaylan's, only with better scripts.  \n\nHis latest, SICARIO, from a script by Taylor Sheridan, feels of a piece with his prior films, but with more kinetic sequences and a cipher of a lead character highly reminiscent of Jessica Chastain in ZERO DARK THIRTY.  Emily Blunt plays Kate, an FBi agent who is enlisted by a mysterious group of men, led by Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro, to fight the drug cartels near the Texas/Mexico border.  If you're thinking this sounds a whole lot like the short-lived series, THE BRIDGE, you're pretty close.  Nothing is what it seems, loyalties seem to shift constantly, and the notion of good guys vs. bad guys goes out the window.  Drawn into this plot with a murky plan, Blunt seems to be the driving force of the film, until it starts to dawn on you that as good as she is, there isn't much of a character here for her to play.  We know she's divorced, smokes, is great with a gun, and experiences horniness as a weakness...and that's about it. What's missing is the shattering of her world view.  Sure, she's world weary, but the rug gets pulled out from under her so frequently in this film, that I expected a shivering mess or a deep catatonic state by film's end.  Instead, we're given as rich and emotional performance as is possible when dealing with such thin details.  \n\nIn all actuality, she's our window into this world, but the action is mostly driven by Del Toro's Alejandro.  He's great in the role as a Hitman whose actions and motivations reveal layers to his character.  He's a brutal man you come to truly understand, and he runs away with the film.  Brolin gives a delightfully relaxed performance that lives somewhere in the Lebowski universe, surprising us with a memorably incongruent approach to what is usually a stern, stock character.     In fact, there's so much that's great about this film, from the taut, tense opening raid to the night-vision voyage into a scary tunnel, which feels like a nod to ZERO DARK THIRTY's big set piece.  Roger Deakins, who shot Villeneuve's PRISONERS, does another great job with this film.  You feel as if you know these dusty, burned out landscapes and your stomach is in knots with each taut, stomach churning composition.  J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's score also adds immeasurably to the tension, reminding us that his Oscar nomination for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING was no fluke.  Here is a composer completely in sync with a director, adding a feeling of dread to almost every scene.  \n\nDespite surprising scenes, shocking turnarounds, and a fairly propulsive yet controlled style of storytelling, SICARIO comes up a little short for me.  There's nothing here that we haven't seen in other drug trade expos\u00e9s  such as TRAFFIC and MARIA FULL OF GRACE.  Yes, we know there is no easy solution to the problem and that innocent victims are continuously caught in the crossfire.  I applaud Villeneuve's commitment to his unique style, finding the breathing room he gives his scenes to be refreshing in this time of attention-deficit filmmaking.  Had he insisted on spending a little more time and care with his leading female character, this could have been something even more emotionally devastating than what we're given.",

Sicario featured new and refreshing defining performances that are classic and some of the best performances yet for some of the cast. Every character knew and believed what they were on the inside and gave such strong performances that made it so easy to fall into this movie and become connected to the characters in this movie. The script also worked with the characters so well. Every character was given the perfect roles and weren't forced to be something they weren't. The main character was able to be herself instead of becoming a hero which she clearly wasn't.\n\nThe camera was on cue this whole movie.

The night looked like night and the bad part of town looked like the bad part of town. \n\nThe ending of this movie was one of the hardest ending to book that I could think of. To somehow wrap up such a big story in such a small timeframe Sicario did it perfectly while withholding to the show not tell theroy.\n\nIn conclusion Sicario was a great movie which provided a great watch while having a great amount of drama. I fully I would not be shocked at all to see Sicario get nominated for best director and even maybe even best picture.

It's a term that has greater meaning in the landscape of the war on drugs, a war that has ravaged the Mexico and its citizens. Sicario, the film, is a grim and gripping and director Denis Villeneuve doesn't hold back from the brutality of its reality. Sicario is a flat-out tremendous film. It's the most intense film I've sat through since 2012's Zero Dark Thirty, so much so that for long stretches of the 121-minute film I was literally tearing my hair out with delicious anxiety.\n\nKate Mercer (Emily Blunt) is a Phoenix FBI Agent called in by her superiors with a very special offer. Matt (Josh Brolin), a government agent whose affiliation is classified, has a task force that he would like Kate to join. She'll be taking it to the drug cartels by destabilizing their chain of power. Kate accepts the job. Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) is a foreign agent in alliance with Matt, and he seems to be deeply knowledgeable of the cartel and their practices. As the chaos swirls and the team gets closer to the cartel bosses, Kate has to reckon with what she is part of. \n\nLet Sicario be a blueprint for how to brilliantly develop suspense sequences in mainstream cinema. I've written about it before but the key to suspense and horror is simply characters we care about and the worry of what will happen next. Sicario places our characters in the middle of an ongoing battle and serves them up as the change agent, the proverbial stick rattling the hornet's nest of deadly cartels. There's a wonderful sequence when Kate joins up with the team for her first mission. She's been told she'll be based in El Paso but in reality she and a team of Army Rangers are venturing across the Mexican border into Juarez. They're picking up a high-level cartel informant and transporting him back to American soil. The ride into the country sets the stage as the caravan of black SUVs tears through the streets of Jaurez, bracketed by Mexican state police vehicles. We've previously been told at what points a likely trap might be staged, and so we wait, taking in the terrain, the distance, the exits, the personnel. We're already sizing up the Mexican state police cars; is that one on the take? It's at the end that the scene coalesces into an even stronger whole, as we literally have a climax in traffic. The border entrance is backed up, and so Kate and our team wait, all the while identifying some suspicious armed men in traffic lanes parallel to their vehicles. They're told they cannot fire until deadly force is used, and so they wait and we wait. It's a top-notch sequence where you're nervously waiting for the boil, waiting for the explosion. \n\nWriter Taylor Sheridan (best known as Deputy Chief Hale on Sons of Anarchy) has taken what could have been an empty Michael Bay-styled drug war thriller and given it a soul. Sheridan's structure is ingeniously tied into his larger message about the moral futility of the escalating war on drugs. As Kate becomes more immersed into the costs of her new role, of the mounting ethical compromises and legal loopholes, she becomes a background player and Alejandro takes center stage. Rather than simply harden up and sacrifice her ideals for the sake of her mission, Kate holds true to her principles, even if she might be the only one continuing to stick to the rules and a need for oversight. It makes her a far more interesting character and it all comes to a terrific climactic scene that hinges upon two characters at a forceful crossroads, each with diametrically opposed viewpoints. For all the action, Sheridan has found a great way for his story to have a character-based climax that hits harder than simply killing the Worst Bad Guy. As we learn more about the reasons Kate was selected, her literal marginalization in the story makes thematic sense, especially as she's unwilling to become a \"wolf\" in a \"game of wolves.\" Alejandro is that wolf, and in the last act he becomes the film's focus as the pieces of their destabilization plan fall into place. There's a scene with Alejandro that is so cold-blooded yet badass that it made my audience gasp. As the bodies drop and blood is shed, Sicario doesn't lose sight of its characters even to the very end.\n\nSheridan's script tackles its subject with a propensity for acknowledging the messy reality. There are no easy solutions and perhaps the best solution is really one that is at odds with conventional legality. The United States is losing the war on drugs, and innocents are suffering in droves. Matt's cavalier attitude is in response to the overwhelming evidence that the war on drugs has done little except to enshrine certain violent elements into power. He's trying to clear a path for Alejandro, but for what aim afterward is ethically questionable. When you've got nothing but bad solutions, perhaps the best option is still one that's a step too far. Sicario tackles the harsh realities of the war on drugs without ever dragging out a soapbox. The messages and debates are suffused in every frame, every taut sequence, even pained expression. It's a message movie where the morality and the escalating action go hand-in-hand.\n\nWith Prisoners and now Sicario, Villeneuve has proven to be one of our finest directors when it comes to making adult movies that get your palms sweaty. The execution of these suspense sequences left me breathless. Villeneuve uses long takes of aerial photography hovering over the topography of Mexico and the American southwest. It has the effect of feeling like you're surveying an alien planet. Added with the ominous score by Johann Johannsson (The Theory of Everything), the tension can feel overwhelming at times. The menacing and percussion-heavy score makes it feel like an army is approaching. The movie also looks absolutely beautiful thanks to the cinematography from Roger Deakens. There are several lovely shots lit with the dying rays of sunlight, which I would admire further if my heart weren't in my throat while watching. Villeneuve also knows when to pump the brakes, letting his film breathe, and letting his actors take center stage. There are several moments of restraint that allow the actors to flourish. From top to bottom, Sicario is a technical marvel that impresses as it continues to horrify. \n\nBlunt as a badass is nothing new after her killer turn in last year's epically underrated Edge of Tomorrow, but there's way more to her than being a superhero with a gun. She's the moral conscience of the movie and you may discover, as she does, how irrelevant such a stance may be in this underground world. She's trying to make sense of it all, trying to go along with what she thinks is right, or at least making a difference, and swallowing her frustrations. She saves the best for last in a finale scene that pushes her character to the breaking point of her ethics, and Blunt floors you. While Blunt is our entry point into this world, and Brolin is amusing as a cavalier rogue agent, this is very much Del Toro's movie. Alejandro could easily be the slick movie-cool hitman, a soulless killing-machine, but he's a haunted man who knows he's damned and goes about his business with steely resolve. Benicio Del Toro can often be confused for doing little acting because he so naturally underplays his characters, but keep watch and you'll see a man who inherently knows his character. There are subtle shifts and small reveals that open up his character, who is so hardened that this will be all you get. \n\nThere have been some complaints citing the film's lack of perspective from the Mexican side of the border, which is fair but also overlooking Sicario's complexity. With its fear of cartel war violence spilling over into American neighborhoods, it's not hard to see this film becoming supposed evidence in a xenophobic political campaign. Surely Donald Trump will be talking about Sicario. There is a small degree of representation with a minor character involved in the drug trade. The movie flashes back to him and his family a few times, setting us up to expect he'll return at a pivotal moment later. He's a completely unremarkable character and the brief scenes we spend with him made me anxious to get back to Kate and the main story. I didn't care, and then he did reappear and I was quite surprised to find myself actively caring for this minor character's well being. In a scenario where it seems like there's a lack of vulnerability, this character provides it. He's not a bad person per se as just another cog in a corrupt machine trying to provide for his loved ones. It's a window into the larger ramifications of Kate and Matt's actions. The very last bittersweet image doesn't feel like victory, more like a warning of impending consequences that will befall innocents, and they aren't Americans.\n\nIt's rare to get a Hollywood thriller that excels at what it does and exceeds lofty expectations, but Sicario is that movie. Here is a thriller that excites, unnerves, provokes thought as well as terrible anxiety that you sweat in buckets over. The general feeling while watching Sicario is one of disquieting dread. The challenging and disturbing reality of the war on drugs blends with the brilliantly executed suspense sequences. The characters don't get lost amidst the clatter of violence, the direction enhances the actors and allows them to better inhabit their engaging characters, and the overall orchestration of all the many moving parts is so polished, so in tune, so electric that Sicario often does more than just entertain, it forces you to react. Leaving my theater was akin to coming down off an adrenaline high and I wanted to tell everyone I knew to see this movie. That's the power of great cinema and Villeneuve has created a compelling feature that deserves to be soaked up and studied. This is exhilarating moviemaking, folks. \n\nNate's Grade: A",

This director is no Brian De Palma and unfortunately he did not have an Oliver Stone to write him a Scarface type story.   He is also no Ridley Scott and for the remake of Bladerunner you have to have great vision and this movie, including all the ones I have seen from this guy Villanueve direct fall short of stellar and boy is he seriously overrated and potentially going to make a mess of the Bladerunner masterpiece. rats!!",

            "content": "For months now this film directed by Denis Villeneuve, has been among the most hyped features to hit the cinemas. While a bunch of law men taking on the Mexican drug cartel may not seem like a unique idea (yet interesting), as its been done for quite some time now, for example last year's cancelled brilliant FX show The Bridge also covered some of the similiar topics covered in this film. Yet, one of the main reasons for the hype beside the excellent cast would be director Denis Villeneuve himself! Back in 2013, he was the man behind the camera for two of the most intriguing thrillers I had ever seen - Prisoners & Enemy. Even though it may (according to me) not be the best thriller out there, it sure manages to grab your attention from the opening credits to the very end. With this film, director Denis Villenueve has now consolidated his name as one of most important and gifted directors of our time and has shown us he is here to stay. I truly marvel at how this film is so tightly put together and even despite it faults, which it has, especially in script, it just never gives you a chance to breathe and take it all in, thanks to the atmosphere that is established from shot one until the last one, you are always anticipating something's going to happen and that is the sign you are watching a good thriller. The movie has a way to throw you into the action that is really rare to find, especially in a highway sequence close to the final act of the film. I was surprised how relatively little wrong there was on the technical point of view, a thing most thrillers (Hollywood ones in particular) completely do wrong quite often. The plot is quite solid, it's refreshing to see a police-based film taking a darker turn than most of the big budget thrillers does. Denis Villeneuve's masterful piece exemplifies not only film-making of the highest order, but carves out a place alongside the terrible news reports as a deeply regretful, angry and at times almost unbearable look into the abyss of a socio-political nightmare that is fueled by first world-habit and global economics. I've never been to Juarez, I've heard horrible stories about that place, and this film (though it wasn't exactly filmed in Juarez) does manage to put the fear of God in audiences' heart by showing Juarez for what it is, there's no sugar coating, there's no hiding that it's one of the murder capitals of the world. It's a deeply harrowing part that will stay with you long after you've done watching the film which in and of itself wrestles with questions of morality. The title of the film means 'hit-man,' you'll come to wonder which of those three lead characters is the actual hit-man but ultimately, what the film gives you is this dilemma - if somebody could finally solve the drug cartel and drug kingpin problems for the rest of us, would you really care that they did it by killing instead of bringing the perp to justice? The story follows idealistic FBI agent names Kate (Emily Blunt), who leads a raid on a Mexican drug house near Phoenix, Arizona and discovers dozens of executed victims packed into the walls. From here, Kate is enlisted by an elected government task force to work for Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. With the \"guidance\" of a mysterious agent Alejandro (Benecio Del Toro), who works as a sort of fixer on both sides of the border. Their work leads them to drug trafficker Fausto (Julio Cesar Cedillo) and the group then works to transport the criminal back across the border. Their journey will be met with many obstacles with shoot-outs at border crossings and a tense hunt and shoot inside a drug trafficking tunnel connecting the two countries, events which will shake Kate's morals to her very core. Few movies this year  have such a clear and defined structure and unflinching approach towards a situation that appears to be beyond salvation, while showing at the same time that life nevertheless continues. Director Denis Villenuve reteams with master cinematographer Roger Deakins to take advantage of the desert, the weather, the landscape, the terrain, and use them as silent supporting characters that also serve to express the characters' inner demons. Deakins is a multiple Oscar-nominated DOP that gets better with every work and here, you will see that he once again experiments with even richer and newer ways of shooting, whether it's the night vision first person view or the angles to capture the intensity at the border, moments before weapons are drawn, it's like enrolling in another classroom taught by Deakins but with extra curriculum to learn. The man just knows how to leave his competition behind.  Some airborne shots in particular stand out as both daring and stunningly original, clearly showing just how harsh the landscape is, while managing to propel the story forward - without showing anyone, no less. What makes the film stumble is the fact that in never uses the good enough plot to make things as interesting as they should be. It really has a hard time in setting up which way it's going and in the end it actually doesn't end up with a satisfying resolution. You are certainly left with something to think about because of the themes, the characters, the atmosphere and the intensity, but all in all the plot doesn't offer interesting turns and not enough moral questioning, unlike \"Prisoners\", and so remains slightly one-note for the whole duration. Still there is nothing short of amazing in what Villenueve achieves in two hours. What could have been a screenplay turned into a very generic police drama, is actually one of the most atmospheric and tense movies of the year. The tension never lets up. An attack could come at any moment, from any direction. Anything could be a trap. All of it, no matter how extreme something is, plays as real. The director manages scenes expertly to avoid any clean and easy action movie cliches, and it pays off enormously as the movie goes on. The focus of the film is clearly on Blunt's lead character and Blunt is up to the task in being the smartest person in the room while also being the one most left in the dark as to the team's objectives. She will be continually conflicted by her male peers particularly their penchant for instigating or responding forcefully to appeared violence. Unfortunately, if this film has a weak spot it is Blunt's character - she doesn't really progress from the green, idealistic officer that she is at the start of the film. Following the discovery of this house, she is offered a change of job - a chance to really make a difference. She is hesitant but is always motivated by what she thinks is right and accepts the new assignment. She is the moral compass of a movie that is filled with immoral behavior, and yet despite the lack of development for her character, Blunt does an excellent job. Emily Blunt, as seen in nearly everything she touches, shows herself as one of the most interesting and endearing actresses working today. Her courage and vulnerability for Kate is personified by Blunt's ability to connect with the character's soul. She lays into Kate calmly, echoing great performances like Jessica Chastain in \"Zero Dark Thirty\" but with more reserve. Benicio Del Toro is downright magnificent. As Alejandro, he delivers his best performance since \"21 Grams.\" A dedicated sensation that calls back to all types of performances such as Javier Bardem in \"No Country for Old Men\". You won't be able to take your eyes off him. Josh Brolin utilizes every ounce of his charm that has made him one of the most sought after actor's in the business. A memorable, though understated and undervalued character that you do want more clarity about. Other cast members like Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan, Victor Garber, and especially Daniel Kaluuya are given their fair share of opportunity, which all take well. Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. Never overbearing or obnoxious, the score is dark and foreboding, it's perfect. The film itself isn't 'perfect'; it could be argued that the story feels overly familiar (which I've mentioned above, mainly due to the subject matter) but I honestly feel that the approach isn't. Villeneuve's direction is much stronger here than in any of his previous works, and his ability to balance the main trio throughout most of the film's duration, is an achievement. On the whole, 'Sicario' is a slow burn tense, nervy and an incredibly well made thriller. Unlike what the trailers are wrongly portraying, the film is more of a dramatic thriller than an action movie. Sicario isn't anything new or mind blowing, but it is a skillfully crafted piece of film that delivers more than your average thriller, possibly because the subject matter is more interesting than your run-down-the-mill crime thriller.",

They raid the house looking for a hostage; instead they find dozens of dead bodies packed inside the walls. This is Mexican drug cartel business, and it has now crept well over the border. Opening with this superbly crafted sequence, Sicario is an unrelenting portrayal of the seemingly unwinnable war against drugs and, more crucially, the ruthless cartel bosses who will do anything to strike fear in the people. Emily Blunt's FBI agent is our eyes and ears into this world, as she's pulled into a legally and morally cloudy task force supposedly given free reign to strike off the snake's head by any means necessary. Blunt is amazing, striking the perfect balance between the-way-it-ought-to-be idealism and the-way-it-actually-is practicality; never completely giving away which side she'll ultimately land. It's a ferociously gripping and uncompromisingly bleak story, as written by Taylor Sheridan, with Denis Villeneuve's direction raising the stakes even higher through taut, immersive and potent set pieces. There are at least three high-stakes sequences that are utterly exhilarating thanks to Villeneuve's unique vision and Roger Deakins' remarkable cinematography, yet the quieter moments are equally powerful due to a trio of scintillating performances. Along with Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro command the screen, the former as a charismatic but shady federal agent with a deep conviction, the latter as a mysterious \"contractor\" who is riddled with torment and anger. Sicario is a psychologically bruising film that offers no easy answers; it's also tense, enthralling and, quite simply, a masterpiece.",

SICARIO doesn't really answer this question but confronts the viewer with it with a story that is multilayered. Emily Blunt is superb as the FBI agent who has to struggle with the disillusionment she experiences entering into a world she doesn't really know and which unravels her naivety and forces her to rethink her own moral worldview. Blunt's character is complex - with elements of strength and fragility that push up against each other in her very surprising role. The rest of the cast provide satisfying performances.

It stars Benicio Del Torro, Emily Blunt, and Josh Brolin.\n\nSicario revolves around an idealistic FBI agent enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nI adore this movie I really do so I want to get my problems out of the way before I dive head first into all the goodies. My problem with the movie was simply the pacing. For the first half of the movie the movie drags and picks up in equal measure till a bar scene which just makes the movie flawless onward.\n\nFirstly the writing was phenomenal! Taylor Sheridan demonstrated perfectly all the darkness brewing under the surface between drug cartels. He also showed that it takes both sides of the border to do these crimes.Thus demonstrating the evils of the U.S. and Mexico. Through this, it was made clear that the corruption and greed of the U.S. go hand and hand with the poverty and desperation of Mexico to the point of true unadulterated terror.\n\nNext is The one, the only Dennis Villeneuve. With mastery of the material Villeneuve painted all the characters a shade of gray before revealing their true selves. He accomplished this through beautiful camera work and magnificent shots. With the help of living legend cinematographer, Roger Deakins this movie is a technical masterwork.\n\nJust as great if not better was the acting. Emily Blunt offers some of her best work, giddily ridding the underbelly of drug busts with remarkable finesse. Her role demanded sheer brutal emotion and she more than delivered. Accompanying her, Josh Brolin does some of the best work he's done in years. Working as a bit of a comic relief and as a brutal wake up call to both U.S. and Mexican citizens alike. Heart wrenching and breaking these two fine actor's churn out the very best in each other.\n\nBy far the best supporting performance I've this year was offered by none other than Benicio Del Torro. His cool and understated performance is can only be compared to Javier Bardem in \"No Country for Old Men.\" He was as menacing as he was sympathetic and all the audience and do is sit and watch in amazement and disgust as we slowly unravel this multidimensional character. Del Torro's performance can only be called bravura.\n\nSicario is a wonderfully dark and twisted, yet timely and poignant movie with a strong cast led by brilliant work by Del Torro. Sicario Gets an A or a 9/10.",

            "content": "How far we should go in prosecuting the drug war is the main concern of SICARIO, the latest directorial effort by Denis Villeneuve. The violence brought about by America's war on drugs is a sensitive one because of the complex motives and casualties on both sides. This film doesn't really offer any answers, but it does provide enough to mentally chew on as the morally gray areas inherent in such an effort are explored. The audience's surrogate is Kate (Emily Blunt), an FBI agent who volunteers for an inter-agency task force that takes her into the heart of Mexico with the goal of finding a top boss in the cartel. Along for the mission is a mysterious person, Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), whose allegiance and motives are unclear (at first). If there's one weakness in the film, it's Emily Blunt's character, unfortunately. While she and her FBI partner provide the bulk of the dramatic conflict, she never really develops satisfactorily, instead relegated to a mostly passive observer. Benicio del Toro's character is by far the most interesting and compelling, and he get most of the best moments and dialogue. From a technical standpoint, SICARIO compares well with Villeneuve's other work and features outstanding cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins (who also worked on PRISONERS). Slow and deliberate camerawork nicely complements the slow-burn pacing, which culminates in one of the tensest (and morally ambiguous) scenes in recent memory. If there's one thing that this film does extremely well, it shows that the drug war has far-reaching effects from the top of the food chain down to a cop who is just trying to provide for his family (even if it is on the wrong side of the law). I should also mention the excellent score by Johann Johannsson, although a key element of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's style. If I had seen this last year, it most certainly would have made my top ten. As it stands, it further establishes Denis Villeneuve as a talent to be reckoned with and is suitably entertaining to boot.",

He's the anti-Will Smith . . . . Blunt's American accent was nearly flawless; Kaluuya's was very good too (call him the anti-Cheadle; see Oceans 11-13).  Then, there's the writing!

Taylor Sheridan works seamlessly with the director, Denis Villenueve to make a film that doesn't waste a moment on useless or throwaway dialogue.  What could be spoken is said instead with furtive looks, shooting angles, pregnant pauses.  [for more deets go to urbanrhetoricblog.blogspot.com]",

The heavy use of aerial shots, vehicle mounted cameras, thermal and night-vision cameras - all of these are combined to make you feel like a participant in both the tactical planning and the action of the film, and the building of tension throughout is brilliantly paced - never rushed. Even when there's no actual action in the action sequences, you still feel the danger building and driving forward into inevitable doom.\nThe story follows Emily Blunt's character, an FBI hostage rescue specialist, as she is seconded to a shady inter-agency team that appears to be following no procedure or rules of engagement in its war on drugs.\nThe film presents some good moral dark spots, but Blunt's character is both disappointingly toothless and staunchly lawful, so there's never any real resolution to the story - no crossing to the dark side, but no whistleblowing either. This is one of those stories that doesn't have a full conclusion as such, but is just designed to haunt you and make you think - very similar to \"No country for Old Men\".\nThe other thing the movie excels at, is making Mexico appear utterly inhospitable. If \"No Escape\" was considered xenophobic, then \"Sicario\" should be straight-up racist. This was definitely never approved by the Mexican board for Tourism, lets put it that way...\nAn excellent, dark, compelling movie - not an action thrill-ride as you might expect, but still a beautifully made work of art.",

Josh Brolin must have been so psyched they let him loose like that, to chew up the scenery in his metaphorically cavalier CIA flip-flops and vintage Cubs t-shirt. It was good to see del Toro do his Traffic thing again, I'll always be a sucker for that. But I can't get past the script's forced naievete in poor Emily Blunt's character, regardless of the pleasing symmetry some reviewers see in it. This woman supposedly trained at Quantico? and she doesn't suspect someone called a DoD consultant is a spook? She might as well have been a grade school teacher shoved into a black ops mission. She might as well have been the actual actress Emily Blunt shoved into a black ops mission. Am I supposed to forget Zero Dark Thirty was a motion picture? Come on.",

Emily Blunt is an on loan FBI crack agent sent to meld with a cast of various fed agents to, as Josh Brolin says, \"create chaos\" to force the narco big shots into making mistakes.  The cinematography is a marvel catching soldiers walking in the desert with the soft glow of a beautiful setting sun, yet in the badlands of southern  USA towards the mess that is Mexico.

The thing that impressed me most about this movie is its visuals. Every frame looks gorgeous and full credit must go to the masterful Roger Deakins. The opening immediately sets the grim and sombre mood with a thrilling rescue mission(Or so it seems) by the FBI. This is where we are introduced to FBI agent Emily Blunt. After a terrible turn of events she ends up volunteering to be part of an operation to take down a drug lord. Emily Blunt's character acts as a conduit for the audience as she is mostly clueless(Just like we are) about the shady things going around her. Just like Emily Blunt, we the audience get frustrated at points when she is confused about what exactly is happening in the mission. However, you are hooked in till the end because bits and pieces are dropped from time to time to keep you invested in what's going on. All the supporting actors are fantastic as well. My only real issue with Sicario is that there was a side plot which didn't really matter to the overall story and the fact that the middle section of the movie slows down in pace slightly compared to the first and last act. All in All, Sicario is a great crime drama that shows that the war against drugs might indeed be pointless. A-",

        },
        {
            "content": "With such a brilliantly talented cast at the helm of a critically acclaimed thriller, Sicario sounded like an exceptional thrill ride.\n\nSicario does not have the most in-depth story. Tackling the serious nature of the war on drugs and particularly the amount of crime in Juarez, the entire feature seems based predominantly on the concept of violence more than anything. It has very real themes which are tackles in a manner that is merciless without being excessive and emotionally intense without being pretentious, melodramatic or overly sentimental. The feature is a very atmospheric one which carries tenacious heft thanks to the firm direction of Denis Villeneuve, yet this comes at the expense of the intellectual potential of the narrative. \nThe simplistic nature of the story ensures that it doesn't get convoluted in an attempt to fit an excess of characters, subplots or political themes into its narrative. Yet at the same time, it also leaves the film feeling empty at times. The story in Sicario is always on a progressive rate forwards and refuses to get distracted with unnecessary subplots or characters who aren't relevant to the story, but it moves along at a pace which is actually rather slow. Sicario is a film which takes time to develop its atmosphere, but it doesn't develop its characters all that well in the process. The story relies on the general ideas of its concept more than exploring its content, and as a result there is an absence of depth in the story. As a result the characters are turned into archetypes who experience interesting situations but lack any particular individuality to make them more valuable than simply what they represent. Sicario is a film with an interesting story that deals with its themes of violence very well, but it doesn't reach out to audiences in a manner which engages them with the characters.\nWith underdeveloped characters, the dialogue in the film only becomes relevant to the manner in which it characterizes the involvement the characters have in the events and not how it affects them on an emotional level. This causes Sicario to be a somewhat emotionally distant film, even though it maintains enough raw intensity to captivate audiences with shock value of a sophisticated standard. The film functions as a crime thriller which doesn't forsake its use of violence solely for the sake of creating memorable action scenes, but it fails to transcend many standards on any other dramatic levels. It's not necessarily generic, but it doesn't push for as much as it really could have.\nNevertheless, Sicario is successful at simply being a powerful crime thriller. Set in a relevant context and dealing with a theme often exploited solely for stylistic purposes in Hollywood, Sicario forces viewers to confront the brutal reality of contemporary crime. Viewers are subject to witnessing the way violence affects several different characters on a personal and professional level. There is a greater focus on exploring this theme within the story rather than purely through the use of bloody visuals, though there is still a powerful visual experience to the feature which is far from excessive. When the film is not capitalizing on Denis Villeneuve's keen eye for imagery there is a sense that the dialogue slows down the experience without enough emotional heft to justify it, but the language is real and the plot points to the story are interesting enough to keep audiences engaged. Sicario has a story which is easy to follow and thought provoking enough to go beyond the mere stylish virtues.\nSicario makes use of its western style extremely well. The scenery for the film is perfectly dry, as is the colour scheme that matches it. The cinematography is also effective as it is frequently placed in ideal atmospheric locations for the more intense moments while also capturing the grand scope of the scenery with wide shots in others. Sicario is a film shot with perfect precision, and the shots and sound effects are editing with brilliant timing. During the action scenes this all comes together to craft a well-shot and violent spectacle of technical expertise. And to top it off, Sicario makes use of an effective use of a silence much of the time as a means of letting the atmosphere develop tension through more natural means. There is a musical score in the film, but it is moderated in its usage as not to be an over-reliant source of dramatization in the narrative. Sicario has a relatively low budget but functions brilliantly well on a technical level.\nAnd with a list of talented names at its helm, Sicario proves to be a powerfully acted film.\nEmily Blunt leads Sicario with a very engaging performance. Without frequently having too much to say in Sicario, Emily Blunt leads the film with a very physical performance. From the beginning of the film we see her treading lightly with intense focus in her gaze which carries on for the entire film. She says everything about her character through her simple facial expressions, depicting an intense state of humane fear combined with determined intensity. She is very easily able to humanize the character Kate Macer without making her seem too vulnerable, keeping her as a strong protagonist who is as realistic as she is heroic. Emily Blunt delivers a thoroughly intense performance in Sicario, bringing a very sympathetic hero to the story and empowering her credibility as an actress.\nBut it's Benecio Del Toro who really steals the show in Sicario. A Mexican-set tale of the war on drugs is what earned Benecio Del Toro his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in Traffic (2001), so seeing his return to the same style of narrative is most welcoming. From the instant he comes on screen there is no telling what his motivations or intentions are. He is unpredictable, and his fearlessly blunt nature empowers him as a result. Benecio Del Toro brings a cold and merciless nature to his presence in Sicario and projects it onto every surrounding character through an intense refusal to submit to anyone around him. Benecio Del Toro commands the screen any time he is on it, and his chemistry with anyone who crosses his path merely serves as another chance to remind audiences of his elite acting strength.\nJosh Brolin also contributes a powerful performance.\n\nSicario may rely on a simple story which is paced slowly and short on characterization, but with Denis Villeneuve's tenacious direction and brilliant performances from Benecio Del Toro and Emily Blunt, Sicario proves to be a very intense examination of violence with very relevant commentary.",

Slow pacing and intense characterisation form the main stable of actors, you are are drawn almost immediately into the world of this FBI/CIA? Homeland Security drama. Emily Blunt, an FBI agent who is determined to prove right from wrong establishes herself in a main stayer of the Oscar set in this career defining role, another in a long strong of successes. Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro (arguably this is his movie...) complete the leads of this hard and fast team tasked with an almost ridiculous mission. If this film doesn't garner Academy Award recognition.. I am not sure what film this year will!",

It's like watching James Bond feel sad and cry because someone was mean to him. It just doesn't fit the character. But it is a revealing look into both sides of the drug-trade -- the cops and the robbers. It isn't the good guys against the bad guys. It's just bad guys against bad guys, except that one side breaks the law to enforce the law and the other side breaks the law just because it can.",

There is some decent tension and as always having Roger Deakins as your go to DOP brings some stellar cinematography work to the fore. All the acting is great and there are some decent jumps, but lacks a good twist ending as thinks wrapped up as you expect the no one is as they seem angle will play out.

Alejandro has a harrowing back story thus rendering Kate to be a bystander in the grand scheme of things; a pawn in the war almost.  \n\nWhat the film does well is hold you captive in suspense and keep you haunted with some disturbing imagery.

            "content": "Trailing his earlier thrillers, the gripping Prisoners (2013) and mindboggling Enemy (2013), into a claustrophobic series of labyrinthine tunnels, Denis Villeneuve shows no signs in stopping as he delivers another slickly directed thriller in the form of Sicario, the latest cinematic crime entry depicting the Mexican Drug War that equally shows no signs in stopping. Penned by screenwriting newcomer, Sons of Anarchy alum Taylor Sheridan, Sicario beats the usual tempos of the war against drug, most overtly being the not-so-surprising cloak and dagger twists involving cartels, governments and intelligence agencies, and where the writing falters, Villeneuve and the film's crew swoop in to the rescue.\n\nThat doesn't take away from Sheridan's creative decision in crafting the character of Kate Macer - and Villeneuve's supposed fight against the studio's attempts to change Macer's gender -, pitting the sensibilities of Macer against the trigger-happy male archetypes of her militaristic - or militia-esque - peers in the flip-flop wearing Matt Graver and quiet, yet dangerous Alejandro, and who better to play a role in deconstructing the femme fatale symbol than the actress that played one in Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Despite his character's association with Graver, Del Toro's initial appearance to the gradual character development sets Alejandro apart from \"the boys\", bringing the actor in at a close second to Macer's in sheer terrifying poignancy and depth; Brolin is the weakest of the trio, whose performance manages to overshadow the singular dimension of the aloof, headstrong Graver. In the hands of a lesser cast - and director -, Sicario would clearly have been yet another derivative drug tale, and one that would have certainly turned into a glorifying shoot 'em up. But thankfully, that certainly isn't the case; the spaced out, taut action set pieces - from a congested highway to a cramped tunnel - come with an air of deliberate intelligence, and a belief that less is more.\n\nReturning from Prisoners and commanding the camera with virtuoso is Roger Deakins - clearly in the running for yet another Oscar snub with this film -, whose sense of space and colour bring ominous definition to Sicario; when the film isn't almost methodologically drumming up a sense of dread through sweeping establishing shots of Juarez, and a bird's eye view of the mortifying, skeletal landscape below, Deakins makes sure that the tight spaces, corridors and pathways are lighted, shot, treated as though death is waiting around the corner. Joining the Prisoners reunion is composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, whose foreboding theme bellows dramatically atop Deakins' visual spectacle and Villeneuve's bravura in molding brazen tension, all which turn Sicario into a white knuckled, edge of the seat orchestra.",

Taylor Sheridan's script takes ample time to explore the three leads (and minor characters) in a concise way, with all of the actors giving really believable performances. Denis Villeneuve also continues to prove that he's one of the most talented working film makers right now, as his style allows for the film to be equal parts exciting, grisly, and human, and it's safe to say that the Blade Runner sequel has its ideal director.

            "content": "One of this year's best thrillers\n\nMore visceral than Steven Soderbergh's \"Traffic.\" SICARIO is about the cost to pay in a drug war and its merciless brutality. Masterfully shot, perfectly acted. This is a film that doesn't allow you to feel comfortable. With each passing moment, it crawls its way deeper and deeper into this world where death is its only end game.\n\nDirector Denis Villenuve reteams with master cinematographer Roger Deakins to take advantage of the desert, the weather, the landscape, the terrain, and use them as silent supporting characters that also serve to express the characters' inner demons. Deakins is a multiple Oscar-nominated DP that gets better with every work and in SICARIO, you will see that he once again experiments with even richer and newer ways of shooting, whether it's the night vision first person view or the angles to capture the intensity at the border, moments before weapons are drawn, it's like enrolling in another classroom taught by Deakins but with extra curriculums to learn. The man just knows how to leave his competition behind.\n\nTo me, what I think is impressive about Emily Blunt is that she is beauty and strength all in one. She can express torment and conflicted soul so effortlessly, she plays this FBI agent, Kate Macer who does things by the book, she always holds herself and others accountable for every detail, so when she volunteers to be a part of a black ops that practically throws the book out the window, her idealistic views are put to the test. And I think Emily Blunt does a nice job of executing that. It's somewhat of a fish out of water story where Blunt's Kate Macer knows she's being used but she wants to know what she's being used for.\nOscar winner, Benicio Del Toro has walked through this territory before in Steven Soderbergh's \"Traffic\" where he played a Tijuana police officer. In SICARIO, he plays a mysterious character, Alejandro, he's skilled, a man of a few words, soft spoken, but highly intense and has a sharp instinct. What has always been brilliant about Del Toro, in all of his works including SICARIO, is that he can say much without actually saying much at all. In the case of his character, Alejandro, there's a certain dark pain that's magnetic about him. It's all in the eyes.\nOscar nominee Josh Brolin plays the leader of the team, Matt Graver, he talks way too damn much but that is also a part of his game, his game of manipulating others.\n\nI've never been to Juarez, I've heard horrible stories about that place, and SICARIO, though it wasn't exactly filmed in Juarez, does manage to put the fear of God in audiences' heart by showing Juarez for what it is, there's no sugar coating, there's no hiding that it's one of the murder capitals of the world. It's a deeply harrowing part that will stay with you long after you've done watching the film which in and of itself wrestles with questions of morality.SICARIO means 'hitman,' you'll come to wonder which of those three lead characters is the actual hitman but ultimately, what SICARIO gives you is this dilemma,... if somebody could finally solve the drug cartel and drug kingpin problems for the rest of us, would you really care that they did it by killing instead of bringing the perp to justice?\n\nPlease read more at Ramascreen.com",

I think it's those kind of movies that are the real good ones. \nThe narrative is somewhat complicated but not too difficult to follow.\nThe acting is of the highest order here.  Emily Blunt is fantastic and you truly believe her performance.  She is asked to join a task force to try and take down the highest members of a Mexican Cartel.  Yet she is uneasy at what her role truly is.\n\nJosh Brolin is the leader of the team..a brash, cocky veteran of the biz who uses whatever tactics necessary.\nThe star to me was del Toro...when on screen he has a sense of mystery around him.  He is steady, no nonsense, and really hardcore.  He obviously has a difficult past and has bee morphed into a different kind of past.  His role is also unknown throughout the movie as we learn more as it goes.\n\nThe movie really asks questions about how the drug trade operates, the true purpose of the United States, and how corrupt things can be to maintain order.\nIt's an eye opening film featuring 3 fantastic performances.  There are scenes or extreme realism that is fueled by fantastic direction.  \nThe movie isn't really concerned with being an action piece, more of an eye opening piece.",

I don't know how Roger Deakins does it, but he delivers such a realistic visual style. Sicario left me with a feeling I have never felt before while watching an action thriller. That feeling of tension, and suspense, but even more so, that feeling of impending dread. It became so tense that I would jump at certain gunshots, because of the exceptional filmmaking.

            "content": "Given that Denis Villineuve is coming off of the heels of Prisoners and Enemy, I was excited for Sicario. I thought that the former was great and the latter was amazing, so if I had to rank Sicario in relation to those two, I'd probably say that it's my least favorite. That isn't saying a lot, though, since Sicario is still a really good movie. Some of its characters feel too underwritten or detached, but it's still well paced, wonderfully tense with great cinematography, and very well acted on everyone's behalf. What it lacks in its screenplay is mostly redeemed by its direction and cinematography, and even though it's imperfect, Sicario is still one of the better movies of the year. The first thing that talk about here is Villineuve's direction, which proves yet again that he knows how to create tension and mystery in understated situations. Aside from the opening, the first 80 minutes or so of Sicario are rather devoid of action, but it's still interesting at a consistent rate. It brings to mind Zero Dark Thirty in its tone and structure as well as in the tension of its final act, with a somewhat similar point of view in which the story is told. Villeneuve makes a great use of establishing shots to construct a bleak tone, and along with cinematography god Roger Deakins, he manages to get a lot of interesting visuals that make the town of Juarez a character in and of itself. Villeneuve also gets a lot out of his actors, namely Benicio del Toro and Emily Blunt. Del Tero creates what is easily the most interesting character of the movie, one that lends context to the story and has multiple layers to his personality. He may not be fully be an antagonist, but he's especially menacing. Emily Blunt acts as a nice conduit between the world of the film and the audience as both she and we learn about the situations at hand simultaneously. She walks a fine line of being a badass and legitimately vulnerable, and we even get to see a bit of her personal life, so no, it doesn't feel like she's \"badass female action hero for the sake of being a badass female.\" There are a few moments where she almost slips into being a peripheral character, but she does a nice job at standing her ground in a rather populated cast. Josh Brolin may be the weakest link; he seems to only play the slightly weathered, smart-alecky man who knows his stuff really well. In regards to issues with Sicario, most of them stem from its script. In fact, most issues have already been mentioned--it just so happens that the director and actors tend to redeem the film of these issues. Most characters feel not understated or detached, but underwritten. They never breach stock character territory, but I found myself thinking several times that some of the characters must of had a least a little bit more to them, but it was mostly a case of \"what you see is what you get.\" Again, Del Toro and Blunt have the most intriguing characters and they give the best performances, but the others begin to fall by the wayside and eventually feel simply like supporting characters. So athough I didn't find it to be as great as others did and I felt that Prisoners and Enemy were both better, richer experiences, Sicario is still thrilling at times, knowing when to show violence, when to cut away, when to be brutal, and when to slow down. Roger Deakins continues to prove how inane The Academy can be given the fact that he's never been given an Oscar for his work, and the actors never compete for the limelight. It could have done with a script revision, but Sicario is effective nonetheless, and bonus: this is a movie that actually has something to say. 8.2/10, really good, one thumb up, above average, etc.",

It's direction, cast, story, cinematography, and music are all top notch. Blunt and Brolin are both very well cast in their roles, but it is Del Toro who really steals the show, he is mesmerizing in his turn as a very complicated unsettling character. Villanueve is great at making suspenseful and exciting tension and the beautiful shots by Deakins and the brooding musical score by Johansson are all major components in what makes this a very good film.\n\nOn the other hand, the film is most definitely build up. It starts out slow in the beginning and gets better and better as it goes. It's second two acts are far more exciting compared to its first.\n\nOverall Sicario is a very entertaining film, but the first act is less superior than the next ones. There is so live in this film especially Del Toro. Villanueve isn't on a roll and he has no signs of stopping.\n\nRating: 7.8",

Second, this movie could have been fallen flat as a cliche story about war on drug, but the filmmakers somehow manage not to make a obvious story about war on drug that our country is going through. \n\nLastly, a great shout out performance to Benicio Del Toro as a mysterious government agent. His character is one that could make or break this film and he found a way to deliver his performance with subtlety and nuance, it's performance that could remember for a long time, in my opinion.\n\nI believe it's in the theater for short amount of time, if you have a chance, go see it. If you cannot, then be sure to check it out on dvd, online download, etc.",

Here I was expecting some action thriller because the previews I saw made it seem like the highway shootout scene would be epic. The entire time I saw it the first time I kept waiting for the big shootout totally taking myself out of the story. I'm not sure if this was my own fault or the marketing efforts of the motion picture companies who set these great expectations just to fill seats. However, after my initial review I kept hearing about how great this film was and people kept referencing it in their vlogs. Upon my second review I gained a newfound appreciation for this film. Not only is it's cinematography totally good looking (which I did notice the first time around) but the story takes a decent spin on how far the law will go to catch criminals. It also presents a uncomfortable feeling of how deeply insulated the cartels are in the justice systems and the extent they will go to catch someone they pose as a threat. I believe this film has definitely set a fine stage for a sequel and I'm interested to know how the story will continue.",

Neither Prisoners or Enemy did anything to necessarily expand our minds to the way we work as humans, but they called often dismissed thoughts and qualities to the surface. With his latest, Sicario, the director is once again examining the human condition under the most stringent of circumstances and once again he puts our nerves through the ringer. Having more than enjoyed both of Villeneuve's previous studio efforts (I've yet to see Incendies, but clearly need to) and anticipating his latest if not based on his previous work, but for the trio of stellar actors he recruited to execute this feature I walked away from Sicario with a stunned respect for how what was being said was in fact stated. Brutal beyond measure, unflinching to a fault and featuring an extremely serious tone balanced by a slight comedic performance from Josh Brolin, Vileneuve has crafted a film that is not wholly concerned with plot as much as it is the examination of the complexities of these people who are trapped in a world convoluted beyond their comprehension that only continues to go around in circles. Sicario is by no means a masterpiece of the genre as it does tend to lose some of it's steam in it's middle section, but it more than makes up for it with a chilling conclusion and a tension throughout that is something akin to unshakable.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

            "content": "Sicario is the story of Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), an FBI kidnapping rescue specialist who is offered a chance to work with an operative from the CIA (Josh Brolin) and his partner Alejandro (Benicio del Toro). They work to stop drug trafficking and bring down a drug cartel on the Mexican-American border.\n\nThings I Liked:\n\nEmily Blunt. Blunt has an amazing amount of character in this movie. She walks this line between tough as nails and fragile as glass. She is someone out of her element and is trying to cope and has to do so in two ways. One which is to put up all her defenses and shut everything out. The other which is to come to terms with her plight and you see every emotion go across her face. It's marvelous to watch.\n\nBenicio del Toro. Del Toro plays a similar way to Emily Blunt with the exception that he is in his element. He is being proactive not reactive. He shows moments where he is very stoic and very in control and very powerful, and then there are other moments where he drops his stoicism briefly and allows you to see his true colors, but he never drops his sense of power and control. He owns this movie and his performance stands out.\n\nThe Subtlety. This movie does an incredible job of showing, not telling. It uses quick visual moments to move the plot and develop the characters and gives you loads of information without having to use boring and out of place expository dialogue. It does this beautifully throughout the movie and allows you to take in information without even realizing it. By the time we get to any major dialogue scenes we feel we already know a great deal about these characters and this situation.\n\nThings I Didn't Like:\n\nThe Movie is Gonna Make You Feel Icky. The movie is grim, it's gritty, it's rough. I walked out feeling like there was something wrong and harsh in the world. You see grisly images and it gives you a sense that there is little hope in the world. The movie wouldn't work without it but I think it is something that should be said before you head out and think this is a fun action film. It's not, it's dark and it will leave you thinking and feeling that the world is a bit grim at times.\n\nOverall. Overall the movie is incredibly well put together, the story is interesting, the characters are dynamic and the performances are superb. The movie has a dark tone and it does so in a way that really makes you feel this dark morose world around you. But it uses that well in the context of the film. The movie is an incredible experience and one that stands out.",

            "content": "Thought-provoking, sharp and violent, Sicario is a brutal action-thriler and gut-wrenching depiction of the narco-wars of which we have only heard. Slowly paced, but with a suspense that is meticulously built up, this is not the usual American story of fighting narco-cartels. It is a polarizing and realistic take on the \"not winning\" the war on drugs, which beautifully wrapped in amazing cinematography, delightful directing and Oscar-worthy performances. Undeservedly snubbed for the Oscars, Sicario deserved much more attention than its three technical nominations.\n\nAn exemplary FBI special agent Kate Macy ( Emily Blunt) is enlisted to a secret government anti-drugs task force led by Josh Brolin and consulted by the enigmatic Benicio Del Toro. The squad fights the drugs war in a totally different and unorthodox way that challenged Macy's understanding of rule of law, rules of engagement, ethics and moral. Every single day as part of this team she faces new things that will question everything she (and the audience) believes in. \n\nThe story is being developed and revealed slowly and quite untypically for action-thrillers. The first half sets the overall atmosphere and the different environment in which Emily Blunt has to survive, while the second part unleashes the inconvenient truth about winning the war on the drugs. Denis Villeneuve's movie is complex, restrained and yet shocking. He allows his actors to fully get under the skin of their characters and Blunt, Brolin and Del Toro deliver what is expected from them. The performance of Del Toro is particularly impressive as the mysterious Alejandro. His mesmerizing presence, self-control and almost inhuman cool-blooded desire for personal revenge will make you think about his character long after the movie has ended.  \n\nIf the content and acting are at Oscar-worthy level, the same should be said for the technical part of the movie. The cinematography of Roger Deakins is hypnotizing; it is almost as if the whole movie is worth seeing only for the sunset scene of the squad. Sound edit, music and fighting sequences are as realistic as the story's end and fully contribute to the brilliant final result. \n\nIn conclusion, there can be no doubt that Sicario is another splendid gem and a classic delivered by Denis Villeneuve. With another thought-provoking and attention-gripping movie after his Incendies, Prisoners and Enemy, he is definitely one of the directors to closely monitor, especially having in mind that he is directing the re-boot of Blade Runner. Sicario is a must see and a must have movie. It is simply one of the best releases of 2015 and certainly in the top 3 of best ever narco-cartels/war on drugs movies.",

A great character study of many different fronts involved in the violent and ruthless war against drugs. In a very well written story, the director takes you for a ride to \"The Beast\" or a.k.a Juarez Mexico, following this group of elite secret government agents, traveling through the crooked streets with the sound of bullets and a wonderful soundtrack that only adds more tension to an already tense trip. The hero of the story does everything but heroic things under modern standards and yet she pushes you to constantly question, where do we abandon our morals? Do the ends really justify the means?

And so the movie is if not everything you would expect, full of suspense and tension, shot beautifully and acted wonderfully. While watching this movie you could feel this was the type of movie that is considered art by just how beautiful every scene looked and it just had that feel about it, that you were lucky enough to watch this at a movie theater because it is very rare to be able to watch an art film this way nowadays. Also even though the story at times was dragging a little, the build up moments were extremely tense and suspenseful which literally had me on the edge of my seat for a couple of very crucial scenes. Something else I noticed was that although Emily Blunt seemed to be the lead, in a way Benicio Del Toro somehow took over the film in the end, and he was truly amazing which sadly out shined Blunt in the end, but still she was terrific and I would've loved to see her more and be the standout of the film. While Dennis Villeneuve did a fantastic job behind the camera, and that truly showed on screen really bringing everything front and center and not missing anything. Overall, it was a very tough movie, that treated a very important problem thats happening today, and without giving any solution to it, it showcased how inhuman and terrifying it is to live that. \n~October 1, 2015~",

            "content": "I've seen around twenty movies in the theater this year, but I can say without a shadow of a doubt that \"Sicario\" is the very best film I've seen in 2015.\n\nBeing a huge fan of Villeneuve's prior two films, \"Prisoners\" and \"Enemy\", I've been anticipating this film for  what feels like a very long time. This may just be his finest work to date, but the beautiful thing is that I don't know if I can really say that, because each of his films are so distinctly different. While \"Prisoners\" was very direct and bleak, \"Enemy\" was much more nuisanced and cerebral. \"Sicario\" is a wonderful hybrid of them both, as well as being a brutal portrayal of the world we live in, and the one that most of us don't.\n\nI judge the success or failure of a film based on the following elements: the consistency in pace and tone, the film's performances, visual elements (i.e., the cinematography), and the engagement of the story. This film succeeds in all of those areas in spades.\n\nAs far as the cast goes, the film's major standouts to me are, first and foremost, Emily Blunt who gives the very best performance of her career, Benicio Del Toro, who's good as always, Josh Brolin, who's always great as well, and a strong side performance from the criminally underrated Jeffrey Donovan.\n\nHowever, my absolute favorite element of the film is the visual wizardry by the great Roger Deakins. Deakins, next to only Emmanuel Lubezki, is the greatest director of photography currently living, and the beautiful elements of this film are a distinct reflection of why that is. A shot in a film done by Roger Deakins isn't simply thrown together. He'll never just lock down a tripod and let her rip. Deakins has a sense of tone that supports the director, as well as a strong subtext to each shot. It's because of people like the lovely Roger Deakins that I've come to truly appreciate the power of an image.\n\nOverall, this is a spectacular piece of thrilling filmmaking that soars under the guidance of a master craftsman. I was absolutely blown away by this film. This is a masterpiece that truly deserves to be seen by everyone.",

Director Denis Villeneuve, which also did a crime film Prisoners and had that same feel of making the audience feeling unease. Well, he manages to keep this film, the same feeling around every single set piece the film goes too.\n\n The plot follows FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) and her team that discovers plenty of corpses in a house after a drug raid and an incident that leaves some dead and her wounded. Kate joins an elite force led by Matt (Josh Brolin), who wants to track down the man responsible of the incident. Matt\u00e2(TM)s partner that is aiding them on their mission Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) does leave Kate questioning their loyalties on which side they are actually on, as they travel to Juarez, Mexico where every corner they turn too, puts them a step closer to their criminal and putting themselves at risk.\n\n\n Sicario has some good moments of making you feel unease, the direction is handled well, were every set piece the characters are in, anything unpredictable can happen. Emily Blunt\u00e2(TM)s character is placed into some heated areas, and she is left under the dark with Josh Brolin\u00e2(TM)s elite group. She is clueless, about what their end game is in trying to go after the criminal, and the frustrations she has when Brolin does not give away much information about their plan. Blunt\u00e2(TM)s character is vulnerable, the film shows the tension on Texas/Mexico borders as they are vulnerable to being attacked by the bad guys to Blunt having trust issues on everyone\u00e2(TM)s loyalties and unexpected assault in her hotel. Denis Villeneuve knows how to build the suspense and even including the music composer haunting score. Definitely, one of those films, were characters and their actions are unexpected in the grittiest way.\n\n\n Emily Blunt did a fantastic job, she is a great stunning actress, as she her characters motivation in taking down the criminal and going through deep territory. I have to say Benicio del Toro did a good job, and this is one of his better performances as a stone cold killer and having his own personal agenda during the mission. \n\n\n There is a couple of things the film does lack in areas, like the film missed the opportunity to go in depth with the plot, instead of having agents go from set piece to another as it builds intensity but leaving a few things left open. Sicario is a fair thriller, and does well with its nerve wrecking direction but lacks in a paced story.",

Perhaps Benicio del Toro was the only one on his A game. \n\nThe only positive I can think of is the photography. The SW portion of the US has some spectacular beauty, and the hyper - violent images of Mexico were thought-provoking, but not much else.\n\nThe film itself tried to be as provocative as its imagery, but it fell completely short. There seemed to be no real direction to this movie. The whole time I felt like it was a 2 hour anti-Mexico, PSA sponsored by Donald Trump.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was Emily Blunt by a long shot. After watching her kickass performance in Edge of Tomorrow, it was tough to comprehend why she would take a script that transformed her into a stereotypical, weepy, whiny white woman. The scenes she was in, were difficult to watch; and even inspired cheers for the cartel members to finally rid us of perhaps the most annoying character in the \"story\". I didn't expect one-armed pushups, but it would have been nice to feel like Emily's character wasn't a constant liability. \n\nIn addition to her weak take on this role, a writing issue took place about 45-50 minutes in the movie. It is The Alien Effect. When you have a character make a statement that we \"shouldn't be doing this\" and the main character ignores that WITH a viable way out of the situation, THE MOVIE IS OVER. At that point, the character who actively participates after said warning should just die. Black guys gives warning, white person angrily ignores it, chaos ensues, is absolute cinematic nonsense. Fix that Hollywood. \n\nOverall, this is a movie with no real message, no real purpose. The action doesn't make up for the non-existent story. The dynamic cast doesn't satisfy the reality that the script was weak at best. Just a colossal letdown.",

Kate is steely and pragmatic, but thrust into a situation she has no control over, she's entirely vulnerable, and Blunt balances that resolve and helplessness brilliantly.       \n\nEqually compelling, Benicio del Toro (the film's titular hitman) layers his ruthless mercenary with a rich complexity and humanity. His character, like others trapped in this morally grey world, cannot be readily defined as hero or villain; they are all victims of a corrupt and lawless system.",

From the first house they took down in the opening minutes the cinematography was great, the acting was stunning, the script was good.  The fast pace kept it all on the move as they rises around to take down the main drug trafficker, not cutting any corners on the way.  Emily Blunt was great as Kate, the new idealistic women in the force who believe all their doing is wrong, even if it's the only way to get the mission completed.  The team is a bunch of badass soldiers from Afganistan, lead by Josh Brolins character, who has little emotion and can always get a laugh.  The Columbian on the team that Kate mistrusts is a super badass heartless hitman, after revenge on the man who killed his wife and daughter, the same man the team is tracking down. It's a dark movie, with beheaded and mutilated bodies hung naked off bridges, a house bad of dead people in the walls, people killed by being thrown into tubs of acid, not to mention those who are just shot. The battle scenes are well done brief, extremely intense and violent actions, where the teams guns down car loads of enemies, as in the case of the boarder crossing scene.  The ending was good, the hitman sitting calming at the table of the family that killed his own, after killing many others to get there unannounced.  Colder heartedly he dispatches them without flinching, without rush.  He is a main of a character as Kate, and they occupy two opposite sides of the force. Anyways it's a great movie, in all of it's violent, intense, realistic, and non withstanding scenes and plot.  A must see, and one I'll buy when it becomes available.",

Emily Blunt is great as a main role, and I haven't seen Benicio del Toro this fantastic in years. The score is very haunting to listen to, and it works well to some of the disturbing imagery that it shows in the movie, which makes it scarier than horror films nowadays. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is well shotted, and the direction is very well done. Josh Brolin is also really good, and their characters are very memorable thanks to the script by Taylor Sheridan. The action scenes are intense to watch, and it's really grim also with no sense of hope.

The movie stars Emily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow), Josh Brolin (Everest and No Country for Old Men), and Benicio Del Toro (Escobar: Paradise Lost and Traffic) in a drug-fuelled action movie set along the US-Mexico Border. \n\nThe movie is a cliche storyline with characters that have been seen before. But the way that the characters are played is what makes this movie stand out. It should be noted that the posters may show that the movie might be about Emily Blunt's character Kate, but the crucial performance is the performance by Del Toro in his portrayal of Alejandro. This is a performance that hasn't been seen from Del Toro in quite a while. I would have to say that a Best Actor Nomination should easily be coming towards Del Toro's way. An honorable mention to Josh Brolin, portraying the team leader Matt. His character brought comic relief to a movie that was disturbingly serious. \n\nNow the movie itself. The first thing to note is the cinematography. The movie is beautifully shot, which is not a surprise with Director of Photography Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men and Skyfall) at the helm. The panning birds eye view shots of Ciudad Juarez along with street side shots showed the bleak circumstances that the people in Juarez were living in. \n\nThe defining message from the film is the bleakness of the War on drugs in the Southern US. It shows how agencies have to \"work together\" just to have a shot at a cartel leader and even getting rid of a single cartel leader just means that another leader has already propped up and ends up being a never ending circle of massacre. \n\nIt's not the story that contributes to the high mark it will get, it's the characters in the movie who you connect to immediately, with audiences most likely to latch onto Alejandro's story after his background is revealed. Sicario may not get a Best Picture nomination but might have at least 1 nomination for Best Actor. Sicario gets an A grade.",

In Mexico, it stands for hitman. The Mexican drug war has been talked about a lot from certain Republican presidential candidates (Donald Trump and Ben Carson) but \"Sicario\" doesn't sit down and tell you why the drug war is affecting the United States. It is an excellent drug trade thriller featuring fantastic work from Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro.\n\"Sicario\" is another dark thriller from Quebec's own Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Enemy and Prisoners) who is now one of the most interesting filmmakers working today.\nSure, it's not as great as Steven Soderbergh's Oscar-winning film \"Traffic\" but it's still a heart-pounding thriller with two Oscar-worthy performances.\n\nEmily Blunt plays Kate Macer, an idealistic FBI agent who gets enlisted by the U.S. government to track down a top Mexican drug lord. To stop him, the FBI has to work with a hitman in order to get closer to the drug kingpin. Leading the government task force is CIA officer Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and his shadowy partner Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro).\n\nKate and her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) have been struggling in this drug fight for some time. In the film's beginning, we see Kate and her task force raid a drug house in Chandler, Arizona. Not only does she find dozens of bodies hidden in the walls of the house, she also survives from a IED bomb hidden in the backyard shed. \n\nThe drug war has also hit the U.S.-Mexico border as Kate and her FBI task force take out members of the cartel in the middle of a traffic jam. Kate is concerned about the operation because she didn't sign up to become a soldier, she wanted to take down the drug lord, not an entire cartel army.\n\nWhen Kate decides to take time off and go to a bar, she meets a local cop named Ted (Jon Bernthal, who is in every movie these days). Just as the two begin to have sex, Kate discovers a rubber wristband, the same type of wristband that was used to bundle the drug lord's money. Ted nearly strangles Kate to death as he is stopped by Alejandro. She finds something mysterious about Alejandro and it turns out that he is a hitman who's seeking revenge for the deaths of his wife and daughter.\n\n\"Sicario\" has an intelligent and tightly-wound script from Taylor Sheridan and the movie looks great thanks to Roger Deakins' beautiful cinematography. As you all know, Deakins worked with the Coen brothers a lot and he previously did cinematography for \"Skyfall\" and director Denis Villeneuve's own \"Prisoners\". It's time to give this guy an Oscar already. Villeneuve's dark and intense thriller also manages to avoid the cliches of the drug trafficking playbook. Emily Blunt is the real standout here, with \"Edge of Tomorrow\", \"Looper\" and this film, she is capable of sharing screen time with the big boys in an action thriller.\n\nBenicio del Toro is absolutely engrossing as the mysterious Alejandro who has different intentions for the drug kingpin. Beautifully shot and well-acted, \"Sicario\" is a superb thriller that must be seen. I think it's going to have a spot on my Top 10 list.",

Prisoners and Enemy are two of my all-time favourite films. Well, I'm happy to say that Sicario, though not perfect, is freaking fantastic!\n\nThe whole cast is amazing. Josh Brolin plays pretty much the same character as he did in Everest, and he nails it. Emily Blunt gives her BEST performance as the lead in this film. Her acting ability totally blew me away. My favourite performance though has to be Benicio Del Toro. This might be my favourite performance from him.\n\nThe directing and cinematography are some of the best I've seen in years. Roger Deakins proves yet again that he's the best cinematographer working today. There are so many shots that had me saying \"wow\" out loud in the theatre. \n\nMy main issues with Sicario lie in the story and pacing. The story is fairly by-the-numbers and clich\u00e9d. They handle it well, but it seemed too familiar. Also, the first half of the movie is paced terribly. Unfortunately, it took me a while to get into the film. I was bored, yet still interested up until the 1 hour mark. If the pacing would have been tighter, I would have enjoyed it more. The musical score is also perfect for the super dark tone. \n\nOverall, Sicario is a fantastic film with good performances and breathtaking cinematography. Though the first half is very slow and the story is familiar, it's definitely worth seeing for film-buffs and fans of Dennis Villeneuve.\n\nRATING: 8.5/10",

No hay luz al final del t\u00fanel. Recorre el d\u00eda a d\u00eda de estos personajes y las micro agresiones a las cuales se enfrentan. Ac\u00e1 no hay h\u00e9roes. Todos, a pesar de tener las mejores intenciones se convierten en villanos. Inevitablemente cuando te sumerges a ese mundo, la moral y los valores que todos tenemos inherentemente, son destru\u00eddos.\n\nEl equipo detr\u00e1s de esta pel\u00edcula es de \u00e9lite. Roger Deakins como cinemat\u00f3grafo, Denis Villeneuve como director y J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson encargado de la banda sonora. Es imposible reunir a un mejor equipo. La historia se ve elevada gracias a el trabajo de estos hombres. T\u00e9cnicamente es una obra maestra. Las actuaciones son otro aspecto de el \u00e9xito de esta pel\u00edcula, especialmente la de Benicio del Toro, que comanda la pantalla. Blunt y Brolin tambi\u00e9n logran un buen trabajo.\n\nSicario es una de esas pel\u00edculas las cuales es necesario verla una segunda vez y estoy segura que va a ser capaz de entregar una experiencia completamente distinta con nuevas facetas a la historia.",

            "content": "This is a solid thriller that has peaks and valleys of great moments and boring moments. When it wants to be a thriller, it really is thrilling but the quieter scenes just aren't all that captivating. Emily Blunt makes some of the more boring stuff worth while because she just is naturally a great actress to watch (and to the executive that wanted a man in this role, this movie would have been 10 times less engaging if a man was in her role). I also like how Blunt's character wasn't down your throat about \"oh I'm a woman in a man's game\" nor were the people around her undermining her because she was a woman. It was nice and refreshing to see that from a modern movie. Josh Brolin has been really winning be over these past few years as I was kind of meh about him in the past. He does a great job and Benicio Del Toro also has some good moments but he wasn't given as much to do with his character overall. If he had a few more scenes, he may have stolen the show. Jon Bernthal also has a great small part in this. I love the director Denis Villeneuve that made 2013's Prisoners and I think he did a good job directing this especially the climax. Roger Deakens' cinematography is really wonderful during the climax as well. Great sound design as well and some great thrills as I said. It's solid and worth seeing but you don't have to rush out to see it right this minute",

Not only does the film include some incredible set pieces (the bridge and tunnel scenes had me on the edge of my seat. And the final del Toro solo mission scene reminded me of a better filmed 'Zero Dark Thirty' bin Laden raid), but it showed a refreshing yet dour side of the drug trade -- specifically the flawed American role within it all. The enemy we know is better than the enemy we don't is very pertinent here. \n\nOverall, I have nothing bad to say about the film.

The characterization alone said a lot about the story, without saying anything at all. \nThe sound and score was the next most amazing part of this film. It hit you at weird moments, and only seemed to augment the craziness of the situation, or morbid sensation you already had from the visual the director presented to you. \nOverall though, I am going to have to go back, and watch it again. I was hoping for something a bit more fresh to it(with its 93% rating... and I'd expected a bit of the \"weird\" from Villeneuve) and didn't have that feeling while I watched it.

It seemed as though we just floated along, unsure what was going on, just like Blunts character(but again, I will definitely give this film another watch).\nBut for everything said; \n-acting was superb(A+)\n-cinematography(B+)\n-production design(A)\n-story(B)",
