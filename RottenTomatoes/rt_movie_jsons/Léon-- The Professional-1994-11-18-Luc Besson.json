    "summary": "Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is only 12 years old, but is already familiar with the dark side of life: her abusive father stores drugs for corrupt police officers, and her mother neglects her. L\u00e9on (Jean Reno), who lives down the hall, tends to his houseplants and works as a hired hitman for mobster Tony (Danny Aiello). When her family is murdered by crooked DEA agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman), Mathilda joins forces with a reluctant L\u00e9on to learn his deadly trade and avenge her family's deaths.",

The photography was brilliant, using many different shots that highly evocative without showing everything. The score was great, the music was never intrusive but always present, always adding to the story. And then there was the acting. I personally thought the tension between the child and the lone killer was excrutiating. It was almost a relief when the shooting started again. You have to just fall in love with the two main characters. And then there is the overblown characture of a bad cop, which is played so well, that I was fascinated by him, even if the character remains a bit flat. But then again, there is no need to know any more about him than we do.\nA great movie, I highly recommend it!",

You shouldn't take this movie too serious. Like \"Taxi Driver\".  This is not animated action cinema, this is a nearly forgotton art of telling deep dramas in a fictional way that tells a story behind the scenes.

It seems as if each individual in the story has their own motivations, there are no true united factions. The dynamics between Mathilda and L\u00e9on are very well written - to me, not very creepy. Yes, Mathilda is always seeking to get a sexual rise out of L\u00e9on, but she is not acting like a thirty-year-old prostitute or something, it really seems like she is a twelve year old who doesn't know what she's asking for, and L\u00e9on seems like he recognizes this, and never entertains Mathilda's propositions or temptations. Elsewhere, Stansfield is a very well written character; the only thing that that screamed 'this is a movie' about him to me was his weird spasms whenever he took those pills. Tony was much too honorable, likable, and honest for a hit-brokering mafioso. The action scenes were very entertaining, and the choreography of L\u00e9on's moves was intuitive, if unrealistic. I liked the character's wardrobes (I don't understand people who say Mathilda is dressed inappropriately for a twelve-year-old). Overall, a must-watch. Fantastic film.",

The action is also done very well, though I think the film is strongest during its more dramatic heart-to-heart moments. The acting is fantastic from the whole cast, though Oldman and Portman shine among all the others. The characters are also done very well and are extremely memorable, with each of the three main characters having their own time to shine.

The both main acotrs and especially Nathalie Portman did there best to make the characters shine as they where intended. What took some of the enjoyment  I had with this film away from me was the sexualisation which Nathalie  Portmans character Mathilda was exposed to. But this is probably a problem which is more prevelant in the extended cut than in the cinema cut. So i would say if you want to see it watch the latter.",

Leon (Jean Reno) is the soft-spoken but deadly \"cleaner\", a cold-blooded killer with a strict code of ethics.  Mathilda is the twelve-year old neighbor whose dysfunctional family has been killed as the result of a drug dispute by a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman).  The three main characters all have a depth that far exceeds that of characters in similar films in the genre.   But it's Besson's direction that truly impresses.

His focused and expressive French direction alongside cinematographer Thierry Arbogast's stunning, long held close-ups and creative wide shots during the action shootouts ensure that Leon is awe inspiring for future audiences forevermore. I must mention that although Luc Besson is a wretched creep as a man, he managed to use up all his creative powers to write and direct one of cinema's finest pictures.\n\nBesson's writing is both creatively playful with funny dialogue and one liners, while also leaving you in despair at all the suffering and loneliness in Leon. His original story full of shocking brutality, clever wit, kind acts, and breathtaking twists result in Leon's memorable experience.\n\nEric Serra's score is riveting with gentle melodies and tight, anxiety inducing throbs of sound for the hail of bullets during the action sequences. Sylvie Landra's editing is sharp and tight, keeping Leon at a brisk 111 minutes that never feels long. Magali Guidasci's costumes are fun with Gary Oldman's white suit, Leon's all black hitman gear and vest, and of course, Natalie Portman's silly 90's kid outfits.\n\nJean Reno is so sensitive and subtle as the reserved assassin for hire Leon Montana. He's very playful and fatherly towards Mathilda Lando, saving Leon: The Professional's relationship with the young girl he saves from ever truly feeling gross. Natalie Portman is amazing for a child actress as the precocious child hitwoman protege Mathilda. She's funny, devastating, fearful, lonely, and a myriad of other emotions in a realistic flurry of acting prowess. \n\nThen, Gary Oldman is hilarious and terrifying as the crooked DEA agent Norman Stansfield. His campy drug addiction meets Oldman's gripping nightmare presence as the erratic and trigger happy Norman at his absolute scariest during the bathroom scene with Mathilda. Danny Aiello is excellent and enjoyable as the mob boss Tony with a nice rapport with Reno.\n\nIn short, Leon: The Professional is as fun and entertaining as action thriller films get, but Luc Besson's visionary direction and refreshing script keep Leon and Mathilda in your heart always.",

Instead of focusing on moments of masculinity and testosterone, Leon focuses on the vulnerability of their protagonists with depth, heart and a sense of love and decency, a rarity explored in the action genre. Natalie Portman has a fantastic debut as a vengeful orphan; Jean Reno plays a surprisingly vulnerable and lonely assassin; but Gary Oldman is utterly brilliant in his performance as one of my favorite villains as a chaotic evil disguised as an orderly evil. The action is top-notched and gritty, with an emphasis on more of how the main character, Leon, acts as a contrast as a cold assassin on the job than in his quiet life. But it all comes ahead in a third act that is emotionally gut-runching when those two lives cross perpendicular. Leon the Professional is an awesome movie that is worth a watch.",

And it's got a great cast, composed of Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and a young Nathalie Portman. The chemistry between Reno and Portman's character is unforgettable, it's packed with emotion and power. It's a good movie, and makes the runtime go pretty fast. While my rating may seem very low compared to popular ratings, Leon : the Professional is a classic action/thriller with great acting and style, I found it even moving in a way. Overall good film and recommended!!",

You can tell very early on this is a guy you don't want to mess with. Despite his excellence, Natalie Portman outshined everyone, even Reno, in her role as Mathilda, a revenge-seeking girl that has to grow up before she's ready. She leaves such an impact from the way she harbors rage and sadness, sometimes within the same scene. While young, this is also one of her strongest performances as an actress. When you're getting the best of your two stars, you know you have a great movie on your hands.\n\nBeginning: 10\n\nCharacters: 10\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 8\n\nConflict: 7\nI think my issue with the actual conflict throughout the duration of the movie stems more from how amazing the beginning is. The first ten minutes of the movie almost spoil you into expecting the rest of the film to be that way. Alas it is not. It moves at a bit of a slower clip and you start to feel it playing out as more of a drama than an action movie. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of tension to be had, just not quite enough to blow me away.\n\nEntertainment Value: 8\n\nMemorability: 7\nThere is one particularly tense moment that had my heart racing: I don't want to give too much away by setting the scene, but Mathilda is waiting outside of Leon's door, pleading for him to let her in. Every single time I watch that scene, my heart leaps into my throat even though I know what's going to happen. It's that intense vulnerability that really sticks out. While the movie isn't oozing with scenes to remember, say like my last review of Dirty Dancing, there was definitely enough to keep my attention.\n\nPace: 10\nOnce you understand that the movie is a drama and not an action film, you can respect the pace a lot more. The movie pushes character development and the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. By the time the film reaches its conclusion, there is legitimate concern for their well-being because you've grown to like both of them.\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 1\nDid not like the ending in the slightest. I was hoping for more. Endings like this are fine when there is more closure. As bad as it was, I still enjoyed the movie as a whole.\n\nOverall: 81\nLeon: The Professional is a great movie to watch with someone who prefers drama over action and you're trying to meet them in the middle. It is endearing to watch Leon and Mathilda's relationship blossom with the mad world that has been thrust upon them. The action is subtle, but the movie is awesome.",

            "content": "\"Leon the professional\" is a movie that I really loved. The film was written and directed by Luc Besson, produced by Patrice Ledoux. It's an english-language french action crime thriller film. It was released in 1994. The main characters are Leon played by Jean Reno and Mathilda played by Natalie Portman.\nThe plot is set in New York's famous neighborhood Little Italy.\nLeon is the best hitman in NY. One day, his neighbors, a very troubled family gets killed by a corrupt cop and his team. The entire family is wiped out except for Mathilda. The 12 years old escapes from the massacre. Leon decides to save the little girl by taking her in and an unusual relationship is gonna grow between the characters as Mathilda asks him to teach her how to do his job.\nNatalie Portman was only 11 when she played Mathilda and the actress was already very talented. The roles are very well played.  \nI remember a scene where Mathilda faced the bad guy. The movements were very slow as well as the talk. But what I loved the most was one of the close up on character's faces. The focus was downcast and fitted perfectly with the scene.\nThe music is very well used to underline the suspens that the audience is feeling through the movie.\nIn the film, Mathilda is dressed up like a 18 years old, her clothes are short and almost sexy which fits very good with her personality. \nThe movie has a lot of things in common with Luc Besson's Nikita (1990) like Leon's glasses, the flowerpot...\nI never saw a film like that before, the story is impressive and unusual. I highly recommend it. \nYou're gonna be astounded by Mathilda's personality and Leon's strengh.",

The acting is crazy, explosive. A villian that intimidates you.\nThe film manages to have quality action without cuts all over, actors doing a very good job and emotional moments, \"This is from Mathilda.\"\nWhat seemed strange to me was the idea of \"relationship.\" Leon has 30-40 and Mathilda 10-15. That was strange.\nFrom Luc Besson I saw only Lucy who seemed good to me.\nA very good movie, among the best of the drama / thriller (which I have seen, of course).",

This is probably a good thing, because for whatever reason, many of the movies I saw back then I've either watched too many times since, or simply forgotten about them.\n\nI can now tick this off of the I-can't-believe-I've-never-seen-it list of movies and gratefully add it to the hey-that-was-pretty-good list.  \nWhile the story itself has a certain timeless quality to it, there is something about the directions taken here that make it a very 90s movie.  I think if it'd been made earlier, it wouldn't have been as alive or as joyfully jarring as it is.  If it had been made much later, I think it would have gone further into the darker sides of the story and much of its innocence may have been sacrificed for shock value.\nNatalie Portman went from unknown kid actress to star the second she pops up on screen.  She is magnetic and her accomplished performance could have carried this whole movie.  Now toss in the engaging turn by Jean Reno and a damn creepy (slightly over-the-top) villain from that chameleon Gary Oldman, and add a truly unique hitman story.  Boom.  Gold.  \nIn the hands of a more \"known\" studio or director the idea of a hitman who gets paired up with a twelve-year-old girl could have easily gone cutesy.  Luc Besson gives us plenty of cute and lots of warm-hearted laughter, but he's not afraid to keep this story grounded in a very adult world.  It's violent, it's vulgar, but it's also genuinely unnerving.  Portman's Matihlda is clearly not just \"a cute kid\" here.  She's been raised in an ugly environment of crime and poverty by loveless parents, with only her little brother and her imagination to turn to for any kind of genuine affection.  It's done a number on her.  Leon--Reno's loner hitman--has a tragic past as well that has left him in an almost mechanical state of being until Matilda comes along.  \nThere are many cliches that are avoided here, and those that sneak through are tolerable.  Much of the procedings are very far-fetched, but rarely bad enough to take me out of the moment.  All in all a very entertaining movie.  If you, like myself, missed it, track it down.  If you caught it before, I probably don't have to tell you to go catch it again.",

It sucks seeing Mathilda's living situation. It's evident her parents don't really care. \n\nOh my god... that part where the girl is trying to get into Leon's apartment... powerful. Natalie even at that age was acting superbly. It's kind of comedic how Leon's life changes once he takes in the girl. I love how Luc hired Jean Reno to play this Leon character. I think it's marvelous. \n\nIt's kind of beautiful to see how Mathilda and Leon's relationship grows and how they become almost like father and daughter. Holy shit, that bathroom scene with Mathilda and Gary Oldman's character. The intensity. You really get to understand just how fucked in the head his character. And what's even more worse is that he has connections wishing the police department meaning h has power, meaning he owns the police. There's nothing worse than an evil corrupt cop.  \n\nIt's so treasuring to see Leon have a vulnerable side to him. I'm so glad the movie ended the way it did. And especially with that song by Sting. It's wonderful because I think it sums up the whole feeling and relationship between Leon and Mathilda. Beautiful movie. \n\nI think what's most compelling about this movie, is that we get to see inside the life of a hired assassin and how this particular person lives it.

            "content": "After \"Subway\" and \"La Femme Nikita\", which positioned Luc Besson as a director to be paid attention to, premieres his next running in 1994, \"Leon: The Professional\", which transposes an elegant exposition of novel and unfunded ideas about the adventure between a hit-man and a 12-year-old girl. After seeing it a second time, being the first one 4 years ago, I realized that I did not feel completely driven by this project. I was in doubt whether this was a very good movie or a very bad one, however, I chose to refuse to give an opinion. Now that I had the task of seeing it once more, to meditate on it carefully, I confirm my second thought.\n\nThe film has vast contents, enough to analyze them with great care. The balance between its elements shows a both hard and captivating visceral experience, because of Besson's ability to generate intrigues wrapped in sentimentality, which at the same time demonstrates a high creative potential to move and simultaneously perturb with depth who with appreciation is absorbed by the premise which is maintained, being points that favor the feature film but are still not enough to prevent it from succumbing.\n\nThe story takes its first steps once Leon (Jean Reno) is shown as a character who is paid to do the dirty job of the boss for which he works. He is a murderer, but he not only kills people, he also sends charges. He lives alone in a small apartment in Manhattan and devotes himself primarily to work. He also cleans his weapons that he keeps in an old case, takes care of his beloved plant, and drinks two quarts of milk daily. He has as neighbors, a family whose father owes a debt to the DEA superior named Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and after an attack on this place, the youngest daughter Mathilda (Natalie Portman) arrives at the house of Leon seeking asylum desperately.\n\nAs in \"La Femme Nikita\", Besson is based on his obsessive desire to see women who from their marginal situation, little protection, and a fragile defense, determine themselves in the search of being killers. The difference with this film is that Nikita suffers from a gradual and incredible transformation that allows an ambitious character-study of how she and her environment enter into struggle, being her story much clearer and landed, because in the case of Mathilda, the subjects are often isolated and their center of gravity is inhospitable and unsustainable. Nikita is solid while Mathilda... well, she's a girl, but does her character really reflect it?\n\nBesson's intentions are evident, and it is to him from whose goals and longings I essentially attribute to the little integration with which the story is presented. Firstly, this was about his first realization in the United States. The prospect with which he is situated in New York is more as if he had sought the European in this hectic place, and when he found it, did not let go, he adapted all. From this comes what I see as an idea of bringing the fantasies of his mind to their transcription into the material. The result is unusual, dimly credible, and unsatisfactorily assimilable. Besson's chimeras regarding the police and thriller genre are anything but that. The softest of \"The Professional\" is his plot. The concepts are excellent and the script has admirable details that will hardly come out of my memories. But who says it? Mathilda is a child, but her role is that of a woman with 30 years or more. I find it hard to see her as a non-fictional character, because her innocence is obscured almost all the time and when she leaves it, it seems that Besson forces situations and dialogues. On the other hand, Leon is a character as serious as James Bond, but as crystalline as a little baby. This does not mean that by his apparent strength, he cannot show himself as a sensible person. But in this case, both things seem inconclusive. A key moment for the relationship of these two to narrow, seeing each as protectors, as teachers of each other and as intimates, is when Leon asks Mathilda to leave his house, but she refuses. The explanation given is as follows:\nLeon: \"I even saved your life yesterday right outside the door\"\nMathilda: \"Right, so now you're responsible for it. If you saved my life you must've saved it for a good reason. If you throw me out now, it's like you never opened your door. Like you let me die right there in front of it. But you did open it, so... If you don't help me, I'll die tonight, I can feel it and I don't want to die tonight.\"\nTwenty seconds of this sequence were enough for her to stay in the apartment, and the new relationship would start. This is the example of a dialogue that as several in this film sound so exquisitely attractive that they are accepted as optimal, although in reality they are not.\n\nThe fusion of a bloody action story, with the sensitive personality of Leon and his friendly and protective love makes everything look unheard of. The changes between games of criminals and games of children are more an excessive ambition of the director to apply this cohesion, than to really confine it. Once, while in a hotel they decide to entertain themselves by guessing the characters they represent. Where do they get all those clothes? Or when Mathilda tells the hotel receptionist that she and Leon are not father and daughter but lovers, for what does she? Besson insists on introducing cheesy things like musicals and child interactions into a crime film. So, what is the movie about? The fascination of this executive for portraying violence with another face, flops to take us to it and rather moves away from the realist, and the credibly acceptable that he wanted to create, revolves around the absurd, the bloody, the desperate, resulting as if it were a fairy tale.\n\nThe story is evidently inspired by \"La Femme Nikita\", where Reno makes his appearance as a 'cleaner.' It is also based on \"Pulp Fiction\" by the appearance of a 'Mr. Wolf' who comes to mediate the situation. But it is only that, because Besson lacked to work more his originality to carry out its mission and prevent failure. The director also wants us to see Leon as almost a mystical being, who can travel and do things without any explanation. These acts may be applaudable, but rather wants to deceive ourselves, precisely with this effort I which everything remains as a fantasy. For example, in scenes where the boss Stansfield (detestable, by the way), sends all the police forces looking for only one man and one girl, are these \"real\" cops acting like that? Or simply Leon is so but so good that they all seem to be incompetent. I say it's rather Besson responsible for this.\n\nTo say more would ruin the ease of a story many times clever that talks about survival, search and revenge. Reno and Portman extract a fully developed sentimental chemistry. For the first time, Leon has a cause of life, while Matilda discovers a paternal figure and more. The style is wrapped over-perforated in an action film, whose copies of American and European films are so predictable that they only demonstrate the excesses of Besson that fly over madness and that it is not supported by any firm foundation.\n\nIf the purpose of a film were only the emotional experience, \"Leon, The Professional\" would deserve it all. But for a good movie it takes much more than that. 54/100",

Se n\u00e3o, voc\u00ea j\u00e1 deve ter visto alguma cita\u00e7\u00e3o do filme com a cara da Mathilda (Natalie Portman na sua vers\u00e3o antes do Shippuden) ou algum postzinho dela com suas roupas extravagantes ou fumando um cigarrinho enquanto descanda ap\u00f3s sofrer os abusos de seus pais. Por\u00e9m, The Professional \u00e9 muito mais do que um filme cult adorado pelos indies, hipsters e seres esquisitos que habitam os confins do Tumblr de plant\u00e3o. \u00c9 um filme que fala sobre abuso infantil, fala sobre a solid\u00e3o e fala sobre uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o afetiva duvidosa, para uns apenas paternal e para as f\u00e3girls ou para os punheteiros amorosa, entre uma garota de 12 anos (totalmente sexualizada no filme) e seu \"mentor\", ou chame ele do que voc\u00ea quiser, Le\u00f3n (Jean Reno, em \u00f3timo papel mesmo demonstrando um cara calado e meio ing\u00eanuo, em certos pontos), o cara que d\u00e1 o nome ao filme e que por acaso \u00e9 um assassino profissional que segue firme as suas regras. Le\u00f3n aparentemente est\u00e1 na faixa dos 40 anos e vive sua vida mon\u00f3tona e tranquila como ningu\u00e9m. Ele acorda cedo, faz seus exerc\u00edcios matinais, bebe seus copos de leite (aparentemente ele n\u00e3o bebe outra coisa que n\u00e3o seja leite), cuida da sua plantinha e quando necess\u00e1rio sai para comprar mais caixas de leite. Por\u00e9m, tudo muda quando seu vizinho \u00e9 assassinado pelo oficial da narc\u00f3ticos Stansfield (Gary Oldman, sempre \u00f3timo o meu Garyzinho) e a filha dele, que nutre uma amizade com Le\u00f3n, decide se vingar pela morte do seu irm\u00e3o, um inocente menino de 4 anos que foi assassinado apenas por estar l\u00e1. A partir da\u00ed, Mathilda convence Le\u00f3n de ensin\u00e1-la a matar e tenta dar um pouco de cor para a vida do assassino, mesmo que esse relutante sobre trazer a garota para seu perigoso mundo. Agora, me desculpem, mas se voc\u00ea por acaso shippa Mathilda e Le\u00f3n eu tenho que te dar um certificado de doent\u00e3o da porra, porque quem romantiza lolita pra mim no m\u00ednimo tem uns probleminhas bem s\u00e9rios pra serem tratados. Mesmo com o filme hipersexualizando a menina e tornando ela mais \"adulta\", a crian\u00e7a est\u00e1 l\u00e1 a todo momento, uma crian\u00e7a atormentada pelos traumas familiares e que desconta tudo no cigarro. O m\u00ednimo que se pode considerar de uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o amorosa entre os dois protagonistas do longa pra mim \u00e9 plat\u00f4nica, com Mathilda vendo em L\u00e9on a figura do Her\u00f3i. Para mim, o ponto alto do filme \u00e9 saber dosar entre ambos os personagens, construindo sua rela\u00e7\u00e3o de depend\u00eancia com maestria, mas n\u00e3o me desce esse papo de rela\u00e7\u00e3o amorosa entre os dois. O Profissional \u00e9 um \u00f3timo filme de a\u00e7\u00e3o, daqueles que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o apenas tiros e superficiais. Vale a pena dar uma conferida, antes que seja morto por um atirador em treinamento.",

The connection btw the 2 was powerful, altho strange and inappropriate. The action scenes particularly in the beginning and the end were so suspenseful they kept my attention the whole time. The villain was played artfully, as was Matilda. All in all, I was thoroughly entertained and transported, altho it's a bit of a downer and very violent.

It could easily be explained that she's over sexed due to her family situation, but Leon's responses felt too arm's length and therefore made the movie feel complicit in sexualizing her. Any self respecting man being hit on by a 12 year old would have had a stronger reaction than him, it's hard to believe he's that naive. Gary Oldman was also too much to be believable. I guess my biggest complaint is this movie starts out as a very grounded and introspective film and betrays itself in maudlin shows of manufactured emotion. \nI also hated the blown-out look of the film, very 'video'- that aged pretty poorly.",

A 12 year old befriends and falls in love with a professional assassin who trains her to kill the rogue DEA agent Norman Stansfield.  Yet despite this, the film works well.  It combines together two starkly different narratives: the revenge story and the love story.  Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in her debut film role were great together.  They provided a lot of the humour in the film, as did Gary Oldman who was brilliant as Stansfield.\n\nSPOILER ALERT\n\nThe main gripe I do have with the film though is that Natalie Portman's character never kills anyone.  Sure, I understand that it is a romantic gesture that it is Leon who is the one who kills Stanfield, but I feel that Portman's character should have been the one to do it.  After seeing her mature into a wannabe assassin, I was disappointed that she was never able to take her revenge.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/8ihukO",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Luc Besson ist die kommerzielle franz\u00f6sische Industrie. Er im Alleingang und daf\u00fcr hasst ihn halb Frankreich. Fast vergisst man dabei seine kalten und traurigen Geschichten aus den 90ern. Professionelle Killerinnen, obsessive Taucher und Punks, die in den Schluchten der Pariser Metro leben, bev\u00f6lkerten diese Filme. Die Vorbilder von Besson waren Comics und genauso sahen seine Filme aus. Der New Wave Stil der Zeit, in Frankreich fand man daf\u00fcr den Begriff \"Bande Dessinee\". Luc Besson scheint ein Anh\u00e4nger der Pygmalion Theorie zu sein, die besagt, dass jede Person durch Bildung transformiert werden kann. Dieser Glauben mit der Vorliebe Bessons f\u00fcr weibliche Killer, macht Leon - The Professional aus. Einen Fakt aber k\u00f6nnen wir dabei auf keinen Fall ignorieren: In Leon ist der weibliche Killer ein M\u00e4dchen von zw\u00f6lf Jahren! Der ganze Film wird dabei unwahrscheinlich und von wundervoller Magie! Leon er\u00f6ffnet mit einer sehr amerikanischen Sequenz (denn Besson verliess f\u00fcr diese Produktion zum ersten Mal Frankreich): Die Kamera fliegt \u00fcber New York, taucht in die Wolkenkratzer-Schluchten und verharrt vor einer Tratoria. Darin sitzt der Mob Boss (Danny Aiello) und erwartet seinen \"Cleaner\", den Analphabetiker Leon (Jean Reno). Leon ist der Beste in seinem Fach des T\u00f6tens, scheint sich aber ansonsten auf dem Entwicklungsstand eines Kindes zu befinden. Wir erleben ihn bei der Arbeit, sehr effizient, wie er ein d\u00fcsteres Inferno entfacht. Leon wird seine Nachbarin Matilda (Natalie Portman) adoptieren. Ein robustes M\u00e4dchen, dass die Strasse kennt. Sie sucht Schutz in Leons Apartment, nachdem der wahnsinnige Cop Stansfield (Gary Oldman) ihre Familie t\u00f6tete. Im Gegenzug will Matilda Stansfield umbringen und dazu braucht sie Leons Ausbildung. Als Bezahlung verspricht sie, seine W\u00e4sche zu waschen. Leon will nichts zu tun haben mit ihr, aber sie besteht darauf. Nach kurzer Zeit wirken beide wie ein altes Ehepaar, trotz des Altersunterschiedes von 30 Jahren. Obwohl der Film die dreckigsten Orte zeigt, die New York zu bieten hat und einige sehr gekonnte Shootouts, haben wir es im Herzen doch mit einer romantischen Fantasie zu tun. Besson hat keinen realistischen Thriller gemacht. Sein Film sieht aus wie ein europ\u00e4isches Arthaus Werk - fast meint man, dass hier sei nicht Manhattan, sondern Paris! Leon - The Professional wahrt immer einen gewissen Abstand zum Geschehen: Wenn Matilda dem Killer das Lesen beibringt und er ihr zeigt, wie man sich exakt auf die Bewegungen eines \"Probanden\" einl\u00e4sst, bevor man abdr\u00fcckt... Ganz gleich, ob Leon von zehn oder hundert Polizisten umzingelt wird, er l\u00e4sst sich einfach von der Decke eines Raumes fallen und erledigt sie alle. Genauso kann er sich fast telepathisch von einem Teil des Geb\u00e4udes zum n\u00e4chsten bewegen. Der \"Proband\" glaubt ihn vor sich, doch l\u00e4ngst steht Leon schon hinter ihm. Besson besitzt die Gabe, von seinen Action-Sequenzen immer wieder in sein Drama einzutauchen. Dabei hilft ihm die psychodelische Musik von Eric Serra, der alle Filme von Besson so herrlich untermalt (dringende Empfehlung: Einen Besson/Serra Soundtrack durchzuh\u00f6ren!). Die Liebesgeschichte von Leon und Matilda wirkt ganz nat\u00fcrlich und niemals obsz\u00f6n. Selbst in dem Moment, da sich beide ein Bett miteinander teilen, fiehl es mir nicht ein, daran Anstoss zu nehmen. Leon lebt mit der Seele eines Kindes, im Grunde noch unschuldig. Matilda dagegen hat bereits alles erlebt. Wenn sie Leon gesteht, dass sie ihn liebt, prustet er seine Milch aus vor Schreck. Dass Matilda noch ein Kind ist, spielt in Bessons Film keine Rolle. Wir m\u00fcssen das als die Tragik seiner Geschichte akzeptieren. Ziehvater Leon kann ihr kein Leben bieten mit Schulbildung oder gleichaltrigen Freunden. Er schl\u00e4ft mit der Waffe im Schoss. W\u00e4hrend Bessons Film und auch Leon wissen, dass dieses Leben falsch ist f\u00fcr ein junges M\u00e4dchen, nehmen wir es einfach so hin. Darin besteht Bessons Kunst der Inszenierung! dazu gibts die f\u00fcr uns aufregendsten Thriller mit Killer-Paaren.",

            "content": "\"Leon: The Professional\" is directed by Luc Besson and stars Natalie Portman, Jean Reno, and Garry Oldman. The film follows the story of Leone Montana (Reno), a hitman working in New York City. He works for Tony, taking out his desired targets. The steely eyed assassin befriends a young girl named Mathilda (Portman), who lives in his apartment complex. After Norman Stansfield (Oldman), a corrupt DEA agent, kills her family, Mathilda runs to Leon for help. He takes her in, and the two become close. Mathilda wishes to work or Leon so that one day, she can take revenge on the man who killed her little brother.\n\nAllot of what makes this film work so well is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. The premise of the film reminds me very much of True Grit. We have a young girl who has recently lost someone she cares for (in this case her brother). She seeks out a dangerous man for help so that she may avenge her brother's death. It really is allot like True Grit. The performances in this film were fantastic, especially Natalie Portman's. Honestly, I'm not a fan of her at all, but in this film, she was really good. Her counterpart Leon-played by Jean Reno-was also gave a great performance. However, Garry Oldman steels the show. He's a nasty, vile, and despicable human being. Oldman does an amazing job in this film.\n\nI think what so many people-including myself-like about this film, is that it's an incredible action thriller. Sure, there isn't much of a story, and the characters aren't particularly deep, but it's a really entertaining movie. The dynamic between the two main characters makes it all the more enjoyable, even if their friendship is a bit strange. The action sequences are incredible, and the cinematography was stunning. Thierry Arbogast shot the film so well. It's some of the best camera work I've ever seen.\n\n\"Leon: The Professional\" might come up short on story and characters, but it's a thrilling experience to behold. The three central performances keep you heavily invested in what's going on. It's very much a modern retelling of True Grit. The action, cinematography, score, and direction are top notch, making this a must see",

We've all seen hitman/apprentice movies before, but it's Besson's tentative attention to the characters that makes it different and ultimately more special.\n\nEverything about this movie works. From the slick but never gratuitous violence to the breezy pace, this is an action movie that doesn't pride itself on how loud it can bark, but rather how quietly it can whisper and still hit you where it hurts.\n\nEasily the two best aspects of the film are the performances and the script those performances bring to life. My favorite of the film is Jean Reno. While I too feel that Gary Oldman's looney, scenery-chewing performance as the villain is a stroke of genius, Jean Reno sets the stage early on for what we think will be the cold nature of his character, but he constantly surprises us.\n\nIt's an action film that packs great action sequences, but never relies on an overabundance of action to keep things moving. Rather, Besson first gives us a strong narrative to follow and then he gives us the action. The same could also be said for his work on the French action masterpiece, \"La Femme Nikita\".\n\nDon't miss this one, it's a true piece of art! Gripping from the word 'go'.",

            "content": "In this film Jean Reno plays a hit man who takes a young girl (played by Natalie Portman) under his wing, and she then asks him to teach her the killing profession. The story is extremely straightforward and I probably could break down the entire film in only a few sentences. However the emotional impact of everything that is going on, and the interaction of the characters transcends the simplicity of the plot. There's something about Jean Reno's portrayal of Leon that is so enchanting. He plays the character with a childlike simplicity, because he is naive and seemingly knows very little apart from his job. Meanwhile Natalie Portman, as Mathilda, is almost cast into the adult role in their relationship because she has to teach him to read and how to interact with normal people. This isn't the only way that Luc Besson flips things from what you might expect, because we are also talking about a film where the protagonist is a professional killer. Meanwhile, (minor spoiler alert) the villain of the film is the leader of a team of DEA agents. This is another great acting performance offered by Gary Oldman. He is the master of creating unique characters with each performance. In this film, I love how he can have a smile on his face and yet you feel he might snap at any moment.\n\nMy only complaint about The Professional is that I wanted more time with the training of Mathilda. I really loved the interaction between the 2 lead characters and so I kind of wish we could see more of those moments where he is describing horrific things and she is accepting it without question. When the climax starts it seems to come out of left field and I don't like how unprepared Mathilda is in that moment. It's a minor complaint in what is otherwise a very good film. Besson captures some amazing shots, I particularly love some of the dramatic camera moves he uses, but he also knows when to leave the camera static and tell a story through the reactions of other characters. I am always fully invested in the plot of this movie and find myself clenching my teeth in excitement and anticipation in some of the more intense scenes. The Professional is one of those films that almost elicits a physical reaction from me in the final moments because I am so anxiously awaiting that moment of comeuppance for the villain. It's not exactly the most elaborate or involved script, and it probably won't knock most people off their feet, but I find it to be totally engaging, and I can highly recommend it to anyone. This might just be Besson's best film.",

I think the problem is that I never really buy the relationship between Mathilda and Leon in anything deeper than a superficial action film manner, so when the film tries to delve into that relationship for real emotional payoff, it loses me.

It has all of Luc Besson's typical swagger and penchant for fantastic scenery alongside brutal, but carefully choreographed (and unrealistic) scenes of violence typically of the shootout variety.  It's a nice and engrossing film, but I'm utterly confused as to how much the public seems to eat this one up.  It's far too much entangled in the \"real world\" to be treated as an outright fantasy, yet much of what is shown is nothing more than a 12 year old's wet dream back in 1994.  The movie hasn't aged all that well and Gary Oldman plays a great bad guy with an appropriate finish but the only thing outside of the cinematography and direction is the fact that Natalie Portman was introduced to the cinematic world.  It's a glorified action movie that's not my style.",

Then as we get introduced to the character of Matilda , just from her first appearance in the film we already learn so much about her. Overall Besson does a great job at developing his characters. Jean Reno and young Natalie Portman give great performances. They play very convincing and beleivebale roles And we have one my favorite actors of all time, Gary Oldman. I love Gary Oldman in this film. He plays a great villain and is really fun to watch. The plot and sequence of events is very intriguing. The hitman trains the little girl across the hall to be a cleaner and ends up falling for him. It's different and fun. Other side notes to add is how this movie is shot, the setting and score. We get beautiful shots through out the film and every camera angle is color and bright which makes this movie much more alive.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nLeon follows the relationship of a 12 year old girl and a hitman that was formed after the girl's family was massacred by corrupt drug enforcers.\n\nBefore coming into this film, I didn't know how deep Besson would go in exploring their relationship. I came in preparing that this would be a basic action-thriller that contains a human story in order to avoid seeming shallow. The film surprised me with its touching and unorthodox story. It never reaches to a point of feeling creepy or even unsympathetic as what Mathilda, the young girl, has went through was truly tragic and Besson understood how much this has affected her. The relationship between the two characters leans more towards the perspective of Mathilda and what Leon means to her. Leon is seen by both Mathilda and the audience as this guardian angel that is present to watch over her and protect her during this time of crisis. Mathilda has recently lost her family, therefore she would need some sort of way to express that grief but at the same time keep herself safe from the evil men who are after her. Leon is a man who has very little vices, aside from his ability to kill with very little sense of compassion. He wants to protect the girl as he has developed a connection with her, it's not particularly clear on what it is but it is understood that there is very little sense of romance for his feelings towards the girl. Mathilda has lost her sense of innocence, introducing her to a world of unjustified death and drugs that is being led by the hand of power-hungry men, and Leon is completely empathetic towards her urge to gain a sense of justice to the unnecessary murder that was committed, the death of her young and innocent brother.\n\nLuc Besson delivers the film as both an action and dark comedic film. Though certain moments are shown as intense and with a sense of weight but there still lies a comedic aspect found on some of the characters. This dual tone kind of felt awkward on a couple of scenes, particularly during the film's first act but it is much better handled during the rest of the film. Besson was able to avoid the formulaic and clich\u00e9 footsteps in action films, delivering something that is worth more investing, allowing for enjoyable returns during the future. I think it also due to the fact that Besson gives us a villain that we haven't truly seen before. It's a figure that I believe possesses similar qualities to strange villains like The Dark Knight's The Joker and Fight Club's Tyler Durden, but like the two, taking those qualities and deliver something fresh and exciting. I enjoyed the film's score that was composed by Eric Serra but I did feel its usage was a bit repetitive, sometimes almost to the point of beating me over the head with it. It sometimes felt like Besson didn't have faith in the film's plot, acting and photography in order to deliver the emotional quality that he was going for. Though this issue isn't something that is abundant, but one can feel its presence.\n\nThe acting in this film was astounding, with top performances from Reno, Portman and Oldman. One can see the fun and commitment they have given to their roles and showing a complete understanding with the director and his vision to the film. It is actually the intimate scenes between Portman and Reno that truly carry this film, having the audience to be truly invested with their relationship and completely sympathising/empathising with the two characters. There are two brilliant scenes that I want to point out as there is something about it that always brings grin on my face when I think about it, and it's the ones concerning the two lead character's knowledge and love of film. When Leon goes to watch Singin' in the Rain or when both play a game in guessing the iconic figures of American cinema/culture. Oldman didn't need other actors in order for us to feel his presence, as the quirkiness and oddities in his character during solo moments are simply fun to watch. He doesn't want us to completely understand and decipher the character, as the less we could empathise with his intentions the more frightening he comes off as.\n\nLeon: The Professional is an example of an action thriller that also delivers a powerful human relationship that explores the importance of growth, love and loss. Though it did have minor tonal issues and repetitive qualities in its use of the musical score, it's still a film that one shouldn't avoid or pass when the opportunity to watch it arises.",

            "content": "Putting Luc Besson in charge of Natalie Portman's debut performance, Leon: The Professional had promises of style and acting to it.\n\nLeon: The Professional is clearly an amalgamation of everything that Luc Besson has done in the past. It takes the best elements from all his works and none of the worst. The intro scene is very much a neo-noir style sequence, With an intense focus on the black lenses in Leone \"Leon\" Montana's glasses and the smoke that stems from the cigarettes, the sequence feels very neo-noir. This scene is so focused on a stylistic use of close cinematography that it illuminates a natural sense of beauty in everything and turns it all into relevant imagery. But what's more impressive proves to be how the imagery serves as a driving force behind the narrative. Leon: The Professional is very rich on characterization. The three central characters in the story are given an immediate foreshadowing of what unfolds over the course of the narrative, with Leone \"Leon\" Montana showing an emotionless lack of remorse in the face of his professional approach to his physical work, Norman Stansfield as a suit whose true nature as an unhinged psychotic leaks into his delusion that he can physically sniff out a lie, and Mathilda whose short legs dangle over the stairwell in her colourful socks as the camera pans up to her face and reveals her smoking a cigarette. Through no dialogue whatsoever, Leon: The Professional is able to use the least imagery to explain the most about its characters, finally putting Luc Besson's keen eye for imagery to the best extent of work.\nThe fact that Leon: The Professional actively makes an attempt to put depth into the life of a hitman is a concept I never expected anyone to really succeed in, let alone Luc Besson whose films have a tendency to be about nothing. He has never before made a film which has so much depth and character to it, and for a man like him to take such stereotypically shallow subject matter and transcend it to an all new level is a truly remarkable feat. His writing work is tenacious because he truly understands the minds and hearts of the characters he is creating, bringing them to life long before the actors have a chance the embrace the roles.\nIn an innovative spin on the cinema du look style Luc Besson has popularized, Leon: The Professional makes use of the same clever integration of varying class themes and effectively emphatic cinematography, while diverting the sense of energy into a slow-burning narrative and neutralizing the sense of colour to embody a drier and grittier neo-noir feeling. The story takes time to develop the relationship between Leon and Mathilda very slowly, but the story is so remarkably engaging that it is easy to forget. Occasionally there is a sense that the film has such huge ambitions that it cannot develop everything to the same insightful extent that it does with its most major themes, but the true extent of Luc Besson's work reaches the point where it it able to go back on Luc Besson's pre-established stylish elements and take a step forward into a new realm of filmmaking at the same time. It is truly his finest work to date with a narrative that is unforgettable.\nThe overall mood of the film is remarkable. There is a sporadic comedic touch to lighten the mood at times, but the story is far from comedic. You would think on the surface that the story about a man training a 12 year old to become an assassin would have some kind of cheesy gimmick to it, but in actuality Luc Besson takes it remarkably seriously without ever looking back. Because of this, the slow-burning nature of the film feels constantly intense which grips the viewer in a combination of tenacious thrills and tear-jerking emotional drama. It's hard not to feel anything from watching Leon: The Professional as viewers are truly in the presence of an absolute cinematic classic.\nAnd the visual experience of the film is magnificent. Playing off the aforementioned intro sequence which drives everything with mere imagery, Leon: The Professional maintains this feeling so consistently for the entire film. In achieving this, the cinematography plays with a series of brilliantly atmospheric angles that defy any American cinematic convention and always capture the mood of every scene with ideal scale and atmosphere. And the way that the action in the film integrates into all this is strong because it follows the hitman subject matter of the film into being more focused on realism than glamourization, even though the cinema du look style ensures that everything has glamour to it either way. It is far from exploitational as the manner it is staged in proves consistently proves to fit in with the accurately. It has some moments of being bloody or explosive, but it never defies the intricate nature of the story as a small scaled thriller, making the most of its limited assortment of locations without attempting to go over the top with it all.\nThe classical musical score is also a brilliant element in Leon: The Professional as it is a central element of the cinema du look style and also a brilliant reflection of the different extents of sophistication maintained by each character in one way or another.\nBut the true extent of brilliance in these characters can very largely be credited to the remarkable talents of the cast.\nJean Reno delivers the single greatest performance of his career as the titular cleaner in Leon: The Professional. Jean Reno has the innocent smile of a child at times and the expression of a confused one at others, but when he puts on his glasses he buries himself into his professionalism. This is clearly where all his thinking is focused into, and that becomes the path to an incredibly interesting character. The man's ability to turn Leon's lack of formal education into a signifier of his simplistic view of the world while balancing it with an unmatched intelligence for his role as a \"cleaner\". Jean Reno actually has few lines in the film because he doesn't mess around, he is always directly to the point as he has nothing to say which is not of direct relevance. And the way he speaks is very interesting. Leon does not impose his status as a hitman onto Mathilda as a form of condescension, and this plays multiple roles in the narrative. Among them is the notion that his view of the world does not rate one person above another as he has to view everyone equally within his professional ideology and that he is well aware of how important Mathilda is to him for what she can do that he cannot. Jean Reno sticks to a largely monotonous line delivery in Leon: The Professional because his character has to learn to feel as the story goes on, but he keeps it remarkably subtle the whole time and evokes a sense of sophistication through his natural French accent. Jean Reno is never explicit in his performance, he delivers a remarkably restrained effort in which he can say so much through his simple facial expressions and develop his character so much in the process. Jean Reno creates such a complex character out of Leone \"Leon\" Montana which is beyond expectation and too beautiful to condense into any number of words, so I'll simplify it by saying it is perhaps the greatest performance given by any male actor in a Luc Besson film ever.\nAnd since Luc Besson has a remarkable talent for creating meaningful female characters, it is beautiful that one was given to Natalie Portman in her debut performance. The actress who went on to win an Academy Award sixteen years after her performance and went through numerous high profile films along the way including the Star Wars prequel trilogy delivers one of the greatest performances of any child actor in history in Leon: The Professional. That's a very big claim to make, but for anyone who has seen Natalie Portman's performance, there is no denying the truth.  Though both Jean Reno and Gary Oldman are the more experienced actors of the cast and Natalie Portman has credited them with teaching her much about acting, her character Mathilda takes a powerful stand in bringing the viewers' emotions into the experience. As Leon is a character viewers can never fully understand considering the mystery surrounding him, Mathilda is the one to for viewers to find a pathway into the film through. For a twelve year old girl, Mathilda is such a remarkably complex and beautiful character. Clearly an extension on Luc Besson's titular creation in La Femme Nikita, Mathilda is arguably the most important character in the story. As sweet as the lollipop she holds during her first scenes in the film, Natalie Portman has a remarkably natural childish spirit about her. And yet she contrasts it with a remarkable level of grit to represent her shattered innocence. This grit is something she develops into a sense of professionalism as she turns into a cleaner herself, and this is truly remarkable because the idea of a child assassin sounds like a ridiculous concept on the surface. But with Natalie Portman in a performance I feel is ultimately the greatest of her career, the reality is all too powerful to ignore. Natalie Portman is made to cry at multiple points in the film, but it never feels like a child throwing a tantrum. It is the sight of a human being embracing emotional pain that she cannot deny, and it reflects just how deeply she delves into the character. Her chemistry with Jean Reno proves them to be of at bare minimum equal levels of talent, ensuring that they are both able to help each other develop. Natalie Portman delivers a groundbreaking performance which is remarkable to call a debut, and something which is truly of Academy Award calibre. \nGary Oldman is also an unforgettable presence. Even with only a small handful of scenes, Gary Oldman delivers one of the finest performances of his career. With an amazing talent for playing villains, Gary Oldman reaches the endeavour of this talent in Leon: The Professional by turning Norman Stansfield into an antagonist called by many critics one of cinema's greatest villains. The psychotic sadism lies predominantly in his physicality for the earlier parts of the film because much of his line delivery is realistically sociopathic and monotonous, while the insanity rests on what he can do physically. Every inch of the man's physical movements is unhinged, whether it is subtle or explicit. And the way that the camera captures every inch of Gary Oldman's physical performance is brutal. Gary Oldman maintains a restrained edge of sophistication in his part which breaks down more and more as he oscillates between that and periods of drug enhanced madness. Gary Oldman seems like a passionately violent man in Leon: The Professional, and he is so lost in the performance that it is almost disturbing. Norman Stansfield is clearly another character in Leon: The Professional which serves as one of Luc Besson's finest creations. \nDanny Aiello is also a most-welcome presence. Serving as perhaps the most recognizable American actor in the film upon its release in 1994, Danny Aiello's small supporting role is great because of how he interacts with Jean Reno. Through his most simple interactions with the man, Tony is simply an errand boy to a cleaner. He is a messenger, and yet Danny Aiello's approach to Jean Reno is so much more. With a complete understanding of the character Leon in a way that audiences never will, Tony interacts with Leon with a patiently direct approach to addressing the man. He is essentially a father figure to Leon, and he brings such a friendly presence to the film where he never conveys any sense of ulterior motives. Danny Aiello's small part in the story is a brilliant touch.\n\nSo Leon: The Professional is an exceedingly ambitious film and nothing short of a masterpiece, putting unprecedented depth into the life of a hitman and his 12 year old female protege through Luc Besson's most exceptionally deep writing talents and keen eye for remarkable imagery combined with rich atmosphere and revolutionary acting.",

            "content": "\"Death is whimsical today.\"\r\n\r\nOh, the days when Luc Besson was good. Yes, before dumbing down his original vision of graphic violence and great characters with such awful films as The Transporter, Colombiana, and Starshit Troopers, this French director was actually incredibly good. Sure, even some of his more critically lauded and publically beloved movies such as Taken and The Fifth Element are slightly overrated, but who cares? The guy knows how to direct an action sequence. Unlike shit directors like Michael Bay or John Moore, he understands that even fight scenes require scripting and careful planning, and you can't just choreograph your sequences by sticking two tin cans in a blender. But if it weren't for the poetic and human touch that he brings to his films, it would all be for naught. In short, The Professional is a beautiful and gripping story about a relationship between a hitman and his young apprentice, interspersed between scenes of exceedingly graphic deaths. Is it for the weak-stomached? No. But it is for people who are serious about film.\r\n\r\nThe Professional stars Jean Reno as Leon, a French hitman living in New York who is (as the title would suggest) a fucking pro at what he does. This is established in the opening sequence, a spectacular meta-feat that combines biting wit and absolutely jaw-dropping action into one massive melting pot that not only entertains, but helps define the character before the audience even sees him. But after a chance encounter with a 12-year-old girl in the apartment next to him (and the cringeworthy deaths of her family members at the hands of a maniacal police officer), Leon is forced to start playing a father figure. There are weird undertones of pedophilia here, which are to be expected: It's a movie about a grown man taking care of a little girl, so there are sure to be some accusations of that. And it's true that the girl (played by Natalie Portman in her breakout role) expresses her feelings for Leon constantly. But it was never for show or cheap thrills for the audience... seriously, that's sick. It's just because she had lost her whole family, and needed someone to hold on to. She doesn't quite understand what the things she says mean, but she knows enough to get by. And props to Leon for never even thinking about taking the bait. Good man. \r\n\r\nPortman pretty much sets the standard for all child actors with her remarkable and completely unforgettable performance in this film, turning her character into more than just a weird juxtaposition. Watching this movie, I could tell that the creators of Kick-Ass clearly saw something in her character and later ripped her off, turning her into Hit Girl. But unlike that bland and rote mess of a movie, The Professional gives its characters some life. Not only does Portman shine, but Leon's quiet, assured personality lets on more about him than he'd like to. They are also helped along by Gary Oldman, a real chameleon of film, who delivers a frightening and goosebump-inducing performance as the aforementioned amoral police officer who is involved in dozens of corrupt dealings, the least of which being his cold-blooded murder of Portman's family. His transformation into this absolutely terrifying character ranks as one of the best supporting performances of all time, and he nails every scene he's in, from his suitably creepy neck-cracking to his panicked scream of \"EVERYONE!!!\" The man is amazing.\r\n\r\nThis film's script is also fantastic, giving us such quotable lines as the one that led off this review, not to mention \"I don't have time for this MICKEY MOUSE BULLSHIT!\" and  \"Never in the face.\" Every line of dialogue is worthy of being iconic, but if I had to choose, I'd say that Leon's code of ethics has to be the best part of the film: \"No women, no kids. That's the rules.\" His character is given more depth than almost any other badass contract-killer in film, and although that's not saying much, it's still a feat. You care about him for every second of the movie, because there's something about him that sets him apart from the other action stars that we've seen shoot up buildings countless times over. His training scenes with Portman should put a smile on your face, and when the final sequence rolls around, you'll be utterly enthralled. Truly one of the best-scripted, best-acted characters ever created.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Leon: The Professional: 9/10 stars. An all-around impressive movie that hits hard from dramatic and visceral standpoints, giving us characters we care about, a straightforward story that delivers the thrills, and three spectacular performances. My problems with this movie are few, but I would say that it goes on a tad too long and that the action sequence at the end feels somewhat bludgeoning. Still, it's hard to argue with a movie this assured about what it is trying to do. If you can't handle the gore, don't watch the film. But for both strong-stomached fans of drama and action junkies alike, The Professional will keep you at the edge of your seat.",

I'd love to see a version of this with another composer taking over. With a better score this could be perfect.\n\n2. I find it extremely hard to believe that Gary Oldman's character is a federal agent. Even as a corrupt one he is waaaaaaaaay too bizarre and out there to actually hold any sort of government position. He's fun to watch but just not believable. \n\nBeyond those two things though this movie is essential.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nLeon follows the relationship of a 12 year old girl and a hitman that was formed after the girl's family was massacred by corrupt drug enforcers.\n\nBefore coming into this film, I didn't know how deep Besson would go in exploring their relationship. I came in preparing that this would be a basic action-thriller that contains a human story in order to avoid seeming shallow. The film surprised me with its touching and unorthodox story. It never reaches to a point of feeling creepy or even unsympathetic as what Mathilda, the young girl, has went through was truly tragic and Besson understood how much this has affected her. The relationship between the two characters leans more towards the perspective of Mathilda and what Leon means to her. Leon is seen by both Mathilda and the audience as this guardian angel that is present to watch over her and protect her during this time of crisis. Mathilda has recently lost her family, therefore she would need some sort of way to express that grief but at the same time keep herself safe from the evil men who are after her. Leon is a man who has very little vices, aside from his ability to kill with very little sense of compassion. He wants to protect the girl as he has developed a connection with her, it's not particularly clear on what it is but it is understood that there is very little sense of romance for his feelings towards the girl. Mathilda has lost her sense of innocence, introducing her to a world of unjustified death and drugs that is being led by the hand of power-hungry men, and Leon is completely empathetic towards her urge to gain a sense of justice to the unnecessary murder that was committed, the death of her young and innocent brother.\n\nLuc Besson delivers the film as both an action and dark comedic film. Though certain moments are shown as intense and with a sense of weight but there still lies a comedic aspect found on some of the characters. This dual tone kind of felt awkward on a couple of scenes, particularly during the film's first act but it is much better handled during the rest of the film. Besson was able to avoid the formulaic and clich\u00c3 (C) footsteps in action films, delivering something that is worth more investing, allowing for enjoyable returns during the future. I think it also due to the fact that Besson gives us a villain that we haven't truly seen before. It's a figure that I believe possesses similar qualities to strange villains like The Dark Knight's The Joker and Fight Club's Tyler Durden, but like the two, taking those qualities and deliver something fresh and exciting. I enjoyed the film's score that was composed by Eric Serra but I did feel its usage was a bit repetitive, sometimes almost to the point of beating me over the head with it. It sometimes felt like Besson didn't have faith in the film's plot, acting and photography in order to deliver the emotional quality that he was going for. Though this issue isn't something that is abundant, but one can feel its presence.\n\nThe acting in this film was astounding, with top performances from Reno, Portman and Oldman. One can see the fun and commitment they have given to their roles and showing a complete understanding with the director and his vision to the film. It is actually the intimate scenes between Portman and Reno that truly carry this film, having the audience to be truly invested with their relationship and completely sympathising/empathising with the two characters. There are two brilliant scenes that I want to point out as there is something about it that always brings grin on my face when I think about it, and it's the ones concerning the two lead character's knowledge and love of film. When Leon goes to watch Singin' in the Rain or when both play a game in guessing the iconic figures of American cinema/culture. Oldman didn't need other actors in order for us to feel his presence, as the quirkiness and oddities in his character during solo moments are simply fun to watch. He doesn't want us to completely understand and decipher the character, as the less we could empathise with his intentions the more frightening he comes off as.\n\nLeon: The Professional is an example of an action thriller that also delivers a powerful human relationship that explores the importance of growth, love and loss. Though it did have minor tonal issues and repetitive qualities in its use of the musical score, it's still a film that one shouldn't avoid or pass when the opportunity to watch it arises.",

Gary Oldman ties up the cast perfectly with his performance! \n\nThe non-dialog scenes between Reno and Portman, set to a great soundtrack (Singing In The Rain music and Bjork, for example), are one of my favorite scenes. \n\nPortman is tough, feisty, and a natural actress.
