A stunned Pádraic, aided by his sister Siobhán and troubled young islander Dominic, endeavours to repair the relationship, refusing to take no for an answer.

Me gustó y volvería a verla.",

A gripping tale. \nGleeson and Farrell shine out with their understanding and portrayal of the two main characters. They are well supported by an outstanding cast with Barry Keoghan memorable. The scene stealer though is the donkey Jenny, one you will never forget. \nThis is a movie that demands to be seen by all serious movie buffs.",

The backgrounds were all just exquisite and the camera shots were at times mesmerizing.

This film explores many different genres; comedy, horror, drama, and many more. The casting is excellent- including BAFTA nominee ‘Barry Keoghan‘ and ‘Brendan Gleeson' (best known for his performance in the Harry Potter franchise as Mad Eye Moody) The film is a metaphor of the troubles of the Irish throughout the civil war hence the slight references used throughout the film. Overall an amazing film which I highly recommend to anyone over 15 (I wouldn't have wanted to watch it any younger!!)",

            "content": "As the utter insanity of the Irish Civil War rages on the mainland, an island community is subtly affected by the pathological violence that has seized Ireland.  When the normal is pathological, the pathological is normal.\n\nDuring the Civil War murder and violence became so normalised that the pathological became normal, which was one reason the Irish Garda Siochana was created as an unarmed force, to use its moral authority in the first, rather than force of arms, to delegitimise the use of the gun to settle all disputes, and to grab land, as happened wholesale for example in Co. Kerry, where brothers slew brothers and father sons, in an orgy of insane and vicious violence, each side driven to out-do the other in a game of rock paper scissors; where vendetta and revenge was tempered with piety and the innate compassion also of the Irish, that even when committing acts of atrocity there is still space for morality; where cruelty and the innate ability to turn a blind eye to it that characterises Ireland in the 20th and other centuries, was institutionalised and affected every aspect of life right down to the treatment of the most vulnerable.  \n\nThis film encapsulates the madness in its narrative, as two friends take it to the bridge in increasing games and levels of obduracy, bloody-mindedness, hurt, personal offence, and by the end, the sheer hell of it, wrecking not just their own lives but those of others around them. A great and indirect metaphor for the Irish Civil War, which like just about anything inconvenient and likely to 'rock the boat' is traditionally brushed under the carpet in Ireland, in line with what Michael Davitt called one of the twin curses of Ireland, the national Moral Cowardice.  \n\nEverything just works in this film. The light (of course, it's Irish light which is unique in its magical luminescence) and the use of reflection; which is what this film is very subtly all about; the dramatic scenery, the beautiful backdrop to literally centuries of horror, exploitation, starvation, emigration, depopulation, mercilessness, viciousness, and all crammed under a veneer of piety with its roots in a religious ceremony that is meaningless in the incomprehensibility of language and ritual, once so much it had to be partially concealed behind a rood screen as were the crimes of myriad child abusers in clerical garb likewise concealed in plain sight.  As Christy Moore once sang ''Everybody knew/  But nobody said.''  Ireland's problems in a nutshell.  AND of course the acting, which is uniformly excellent.\n\nDrink, religion, sexual frustration and abuse, combined with two-facedness, cruelty, bloody-mindedness, all the usual and well founded tropes, serve to convey a sort of logical descent into madness that echoes the Civil War seizing the country generally, in an Atlantean outpost of eccentricity and conformity, where power is abused by Church and State to maintain the population in a general state of infantilism and idiocy just as it was on the mainland, ''Christ'' ferried across on a Galway Hooker in the form of the prieshteen, fat complacent and resplendent in the power of his dog-collar, embraced by ''Caesar'': the corrupt local Garda sergeant, a former member of ''the national movement'' who was brutalised by the killing he did during the War of Independence and now brutalises in turn his son and those whom incur his displeasure..hand in glove.  \n\nSo it goes, and so it is today as well, so long as the Irish keep telling themselves and everyone who will listen convenient lies to avoid the pain of confronting the truth.

Themes such as friendship, ambition and loneliness are present in the story, which might feel slow at times, but it is elevated by the incredible cast performances: Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan are just outstanding. Some scenes are plain funny, while others are quite melodramatic, which makes it a nice balance. Also, Carter Burwell's score is hauntingly beautiful!

First off, the cinematography is gorgeous, highlighting the beauty, loneliness, and mystery of living in a coastal Irish village. The acting is superb. Not only the two main characters, Padraic and Colm, played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, but the supporting cast as well. What I really appreciate about this flick, is a totally original take on a friendship taking a turn for the worst. This is not your mama's Lifetime movie, this is a twisted and disturbing trip down the rabbit hole,  which decent into madness only goes deeper and deeper. The only reason I did not give this five stars is how unbelievable and crazy Colm reacts in Padraic's refusal to believe their friendship is ending. Veered a bit too much on the deep end, to make it a believable scenario.",

Gunshots are within hearing across the water throughout the movie. As one reviewer sums it up, \"Through their in-fighting, they destroyed themselves.\" We've all seen and maybe even been in relationships like that between people and between peoples. A visitor from another planet at any era in our history might shake its head at our folly with dismay—\"you all make no sense\"—just as we do while watching this movie. \n\nWatching with compassion for the characters—and the excellent acting does invite empathy—I'm left longing for all such stupidity and unnecessary misery to end once and for all. \n\nAny great tragedy has a similar impact. I'm left looking into my own heart. In this case, I might ask, Where do I sabotage myself? Where do I undermine my own chances to experience happiness and contribute to the well-being of others? In what ways have I been blind to being my own worst enemy, and what has the impact been on others?\n\nIf even a few people come away from the movie with that kind of soul-searching, it deserves whatever prizes it may get.",

Gleeson's and Farrell's characters resolve for the paths they have chosen are well balanced by more hopeful characters placed around them, played by Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan.\n\nThe conflict feels like an eternal human conflict, yet also feels timely and pressing for today, as isolation is so present in our searches for meaning and belonging.\n\nThe fictional isle of Inisherin provides a beautiful, threatening, lonely backdrop for this story, heightening the emotions our characters feel.

But the awards keep  pouring in for Best Picture, Best Actors, Best Screenplay and Best director, so I think that tells you why we think Banshees is a perfect film. It's certainly McDonagh's perfect screenplay. The master of dark comedy takes it deeper into tragicomedy with this one. The story is profound. One viewing only takes away one layer.  The dissolution of both men comes  to a gut punch at the end. Fans have filled YouTube with debates for weeks now about the layers of meaning here. The metaphors, the foreshadowing, the symbolism. It's wonderful to read all the interpretations.\nIf the tragedy of the story gets you down, you are not seeing the gallows humor peppered throughout. We saw it twice in a theater and the audience 😆 as the hilarious scenes were weaved into the sorrowful ones. This really is a masterpiece. And the 4 performances are absolutely extraordinary. All four nominated by every awards groups. As is McDonagh for directing and screenplay. This is truly a must-see. At least twice. The Irish brogue is much clearer too.☺️ We've streamed it four more times since November and are still chewing on it.  Best film of 2022.",

            "content": "Acclaimed playwright and director Martin McDonagh delivers another masterful ensemble piece to audiences with his latest film \"The Banshees of Inisherin\". The black comedy reunites leads Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson with McDonagh, who directed them both in his 2008 Oscar-nominated film \"In Bruges\". After it's world premiere at this year's Venice International Film Festival, the film went on to receive a rapturous 15-minute standing ovation, five minutes longer than McDonagh's previous film \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\". \n\nThe film takes place in 1920s Ireland, against the backdrop of the Irish Civil War, on the fictional island of Inisherin and tells the story of two friends Pádraic (Farrell) and Colm (Gleeson). One day, Colm decides to abruptly end his long-running friendship with Pádraic, claiming the man is ‘too dull' for him to spend the rest of his life around. An escalating battle then begins between the two friends, and it soon becomes the talk of the village, with many just as confused as Pádraic with Colm's decision. As the growing tensions between the two grow, it's not long before it boils over and results in devastating consequences for both feuding men. \n\nColin Farrell leads an uber-talented cast comprised of some of Ireland's greatest talents like Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan, all delivering knockout performances. Farrell's work is almost certain to land him a spot in this year's Best Actor line-up as he plays Pádraic, the harmless easy-going farmer, until he finally snaps and becomes a ruthless man out for revenge, and perhaps that's what makes his performance so fascinating to watch unfold on the big screen. The friendship Farrell shares with his co-star Brendan Gleeson elevates both performances making them feel much more authentic and believable. The pair share a hilarious back and forth that's embellished by McDonagh's screenplay. Gleeson's role as Colm, a man who finds himself in the later years of his life wishing to be more creative, and have more interesting conversations with those around him, is terrific and perfectly compliments Farrell's performance. The film's other standout performance, alongside Farrell's, comes from Kerry Condon. The Irish actress, probably best known for voicing ‘Friday' in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, gives a marvellous turn as Pádraic's sister, Siobhan. Condon ends up acting as a mediator between the two men, trying to keep them apart to prevent Colm from resorting to drastic action. Condon boosts every scene she's in to a whole other level and she ends up being one of the best parts of the film. \n\nDirector Martin McDonagh pens a screenplay that balances side-splitting hilarity with tear-jerking emotion and reminds you exactly why he has two Oscar-nominations for writing under his belt. It's sharp, witty, and brilliantly tells the story of what happens when a friendship turns sour. McDonagh does a skilful job blending the comedic tones at the start of the film with the tragedy and drama that becomes more dominant towards the end. This balance, combined with McDonagh's sensational directorial effort, makes \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" such a unique and entertaining film. Perhaps what else makes the film so good, and sets it apart from a large majority of this year's awards contenders, is that it isn't an intricate biopic about a famous figure or some overbearing think piece, but is instead a rich, amusing film about friendship. \n\n\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" brings some delightful visuals to the screen alongside the engaging narrative and likeable characters. Cinematographer Ben Davis, who worked with McDonagh on \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", uses the scenic Irish coastlines to his advantage to effortlessly enhance the natural beauty of the film.",

At some point in your life you reach a moment when you enjoy nothing much happening slowly. Car chases and shoot outs make me reach for the \"clicker\" but this ticked all my my boxes; though sometimes I thought the donkey was moving a bit too quickly!! Another triumph with a fantastic supporting cast in Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan and a perfectly written screenplay. I hope to see more from Gleeson and Farrell in a similar vein. A fall-out between two mates, in an island community, with unimaginable consequences.",

That is, until that moment. For reasons unknown, Colm wants nothing more to do with Padriac. \"I just don't like you anymore\" Colm offers. The calendar shows \"April 1, 1923\", and Padriac doesn't take this unexplained change of behavior by Colm very well... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the highly anticipated reunion of writer-director Martin McDonagh, and lead performers Farrell and Gleeson, 14 years after the now classic \"In Bruges\". I too was eager to see how this reunion would play out, but then something completely unexpected happened: I found the Colin Farrell character to be irritating and off-putting, to the point where it was almost too much to bear or see. Without spoiling anything, I will say that things are somewhat better in the movie's second hour. But I could never get into the proper flow of the movie, let alone rave about it as many others have done. I completely understand that my viewpoint is definitely in the minority. And that this film has been hailed critically (it's currently rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). The most striking thing about the movie for me was the strong performance of Barry Keoghan (who starred in \"Dunkirk\" a few years back). This is a subjective opinion of course.\n\n\"The Banchees of Inisherin\" premiered at this year's Venice Film Festival to universal acclaim, and opened in theaters in November. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 15 people). If you are a fan of Martin McDonagh's earlier work of or Colin Farrell or Brendon Gleeson, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

            "content": "A movie with clear award aspirations. I'd submit it succeeded. \nThe essential ingredients of this movie are excellent. A fantastic and interesting screenplay. Top caliber acting throughout from the leads to smaller side characters. Beautifully shot and wonderfully composed. Atmospheric and engaging. It is difficult to fault any of those classic ingredients. Uniformly of high-quality top to bottom. \nThe second piece is how well do the essential parts come together. Sometimes a movie is less than the sum of its parts, or an Oscar winning performance is all a piece really offers amongst other flaws. I think this movie attains the cliché of being more than the sum of its great pieces. The movie has a simple and, in some ways, predictable narrative start and end. The meat of this journey though is built on a deeply strange turn and a bit of a quirky premise. The main characters, we are led to believe, were once good friends, or at least spent much time together.   One day the smarmy tortured genius (Gleeson, born to be that character) decides his time is better spent not hanging around the dim-witted nice fellow (Farrell). He wants to be remembered with his music, not the friendships of people who will die. The genius let's the dullard know as much, and he takes the news not well , with confusion and hurt. Our dull man, you see, just strives to get along. The genius' plan, creative and full of that smarm, is to mutilate himself every time our nice dull person offends his decision to be left alone. It is extreme and seems remarkably odd for our supposed once great friends.\nI do not profess to know enough about the nitty gritty details of the Irish Civil War, which is the period, setting and backdrop of this film. I am not sure you need to know a lot to surmise that a civil war about how to settle a treaty, where the past allies of an independence war turn on one another, has many parallels to this story. I am not sure the point of the movie is that. I think the theme is more universal and emotional. In Irish tradition, I think the point is exploring people surrounded, consumed, and trapped by their grief and loneliness. \nYou never get the full details of the main characters backgrounds, except for Dominic, played with a measured and wonderful performance by Barry Keoghan. We know the sources of Dominic's pain rooted in abuse and torment. The other characters we can guess, but it's clear no one here has a healthy life path. Only one character, Siobhan (a brilliant performance by Kerry Condon), the dull man's sister escapes the trappings of the island. Even that act of escaping, helps bring about the ruin of those still inside. \nThe great trick of the movie, at least in my view, is how the measured actions of the characters lead to their unravelling without them intending it to happen.  There is some element of dessert in the result, but the end here lacks the usual trapping of karma. The end isn't poetic justice of obvious choices leading to that end, but relatable mistakes rooted in grief. In my mind, that is why it is so incredibly fascinating to watch. \nThe things we discover post break up is the flaws of our characters, revealed, or maybe caused by the split. We discover that our genius, as revealed in a bar scene with the dull man's truly brilliant sister, might not be the Mozart in waiting he hopes. Our dull nice man might also not be so nice when pushed by confusion, guilt and isolation. Our dullard lies to a man, with a splash of comedic innocence, as part of a plan to win back his smart friend. The ripple effects of the two sides respective choices become vast, dark and lead to deep lasting scars in the community of Inisherin. The dull man's choices dissolution his vulnerable friend, Dominic and speed about his own consumption by grief. The smart man's disregard for feelings or normal social concern has disastrous results when he, without any overt malice, kills Farrell's last remaining companion, Jenny, the donkey. This is the last straw from the hurt dull man who thereafter escalates the feud past the point of return. Whose fault is all this pain? Hard to say, probably no one and everyone. \nMaybe that is the nature of grief and stubborn isolation. It consumes and destroys everything around it, even if you don't mean it to, maybe even if you mean the opposite. I am not sure the smart man's hope to be left alone was all that sinister. Nor were the dull man's hopes to keep his friend all that wrong. The irony being both characters complemented each other in so many ways.",

            "content": "Wow\n\nI haven't felt so completely absorbed and thought provoked in a cinema, in a very, very long time, perhaps ever. The Banshees of Inisherin delivers a mind blowing analysis on the breaking of a friendship and the war between two personalities, that is a tragic and brilliant metaphor for the war between enemies, in this case specifically the Irish civil war. \nOutstandingly performed by the lead roles, the characters in Banshees are all so complex and powerful, that you completely forget that you have seen the talented actors who play them before, and feel convinced you are looking at authentic people in real life. I did not see Brendan Gleeson for most of the movie, after about 10 seconds of him on screen, I only saw Colm. \nIn praise of subtle performance I was while watching this movie. Pauses between lines and full ranges of emotions expressed in silent facial expressions transform the simplest of conversation topics in the movie, into full blown literary scenes.\nEven side characters like the priest, the cop, and Dominic, are all in there own, such crucial and full people, despite how little time they might share next to the leads Glesson, Farrel, and Condon.\n\nWhat an incredible effect this comedic and dramatic writing had on the audience. While feeling tense and petrified throughout the movie, you also find yourself laughing at moments right through until the end. It is one of the many aspects that makes it feel jarring, and it somehow lightens the load of the story, which makes what is happening feel somewhat normal. The leads, while committing and observing such disturbing acts, stay civil. It brings it back from a horrific violent tragedy, and makes it feel like a simple fight between friends again. It allows us to observe the breakup of this friendship in a more sound way, despite the gruesome undertones and imagery.\n\nI hope I am making sense, but the movie, in doing this, becomes a perfect metaphor for war. For example, in a war, one hundred people could die in a battle, and then the war can end the next day, and suddenly everything would be alright between the two parties. The armies captains could shake hands and go their separate ways, as if no-one was killed, all sense of morality is lost. The result of the war, being a destruction of each party, because neither would stop.\nThat is what is mainly represented by The Banshees of Inisherin, the complete loss of morality, with the disregard of destroying ones self. Colms character has no remorse about ending the friendship and cutting off his fingers as a message, just as Padraic has no remorse over carrying on talking to Colm, despite Colms self harm.\nBoth parties, just like in war, will end up destroying themselves. Colm loses his ability to play music, the only reason he started this dark journey, and Padraic loses his sister. Again a synonym for what he was trying to preserve by carrying on - a loving connection. Padraic also loses his ‘niceness', another aspect of life that was important to him, which brings me to the cause of the battle, and the question asked by it.\n\nWhat is more important, niceness and everyday deeds that those around you can appreciate, or leaving a mark on the world, whatever the cost, that people will appreciate for centuries? That is the question The Banshees of Inisherin asks us. What is interesting however is that we never see the desired result for either of the characters efforts, we never hear Colms song played in full, representing that it did not have an everlasting affect that Colm intended to, instead the movie focused on his grotesque self mutilation, leaving an everlasting sense of damage of himself and their friendship. That is what Colm achieved. Padraic never achieved exhibiting niceness as he intended to, instead we focus on his drive to harm, first emotionally, then physically, and the lasting theme is his angry nature.\n\nIn the end The Banshees of Inisherin is an incredible metaphor for war and battle, and it is a culmination of themes that when put together, will leave you dazed, and in awe of the human nature.",

Loved and despised in equal doses, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" nevertheless is rewarding cinema. Set solely on the gloriously green rolling knolls of a cute island (sit down tourists, no such place) where the rain only sprinkles at night, the muffled sounds of revolutionary shots fired are at a safe distance on the mainland, and the locals gather daily at the local pub. All seems idyllic in the charming farming community, until a long-standing friendship is suddenly disrupted. Forget small town, this is a small island, where everyone not only knows everyone, but appear to have no will to escape. \n\nThe break-up, abrupt, congenial, silent, eats away at a confused Padraic (Colin Farrell and his expressive eyebrows). A simple man, his confusion and childlike determination to mend matters with the stoic and complicated Colm (Brendan Gleeson) is rife with comedic tension, until, well, until things get way out of hand.\n\nThe battle of wills takes on an unsavoury, physical bent that becomes the knife twist in the film. One which tests an audiences' mettle. An allegory for the warring factions on the horizon, the odd couples' relationship runs the gamut of absurd to horrific. A tragic comedy that delivers more victims than victors. \n\nFarrell and Gleeson are superb, bringing plenty of grand ideas to the table - the regiment of life, the role of friendship, reinventing oneself, the cuffs of relationships, unrequited love, vengeance, and mortality. Plus a bunch more. Sunny yet dark. Do a favour with a viewing.\n\n-\thipCRANK",

It centers around the titular islands off of Ireland, during their Civil War. Not many will realize after watching this film that Ireland boasts one of the most thriving modern economies, and that despite the border which enshrouds its legacy there are only 18% of the Irish counties within that district which rebel against the Christian doctrine. My aunt and uncle are members of a local traditional Irish music band and play at bars frequently within the area. Directly from them, I learned about Riverdance and the culture of Gaelic traditions. My uncle plays the Irish flute, and my aunt plays the fiddle. The problems with this movie are major, however. The violence with Gleeson really overshadow the meaningfulness which was intended for the film. They could have done away with some of the violent imagery. As a fan of horror movies, even I was taken aback by the scenes when they had very little payoff and even smaller plot building around them. Other parts of the movie remind me of Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven, but with even more authenticity. Also subtracting from the film were superstar Colin Farrel's spray tan. How could a man on the islands of Ireland use so much spray tan? His performance was on par, but his often-confused facial expressions did little to enhance the script. Barry Keoghan was underutilized, I thought, yet brought a lot more to the movie than Farrel and his overutilized sister. The movie perpetuates myths about Ireland which could have been chiseled away at, I thought. However, it was an enjoyable, lighthearted movie with its hands just on too many deep pockets of emotion to hold together perfectly. Had it been a little simpler with violence, and a little less overacted by Farrel, it could have been golden. Also, I thought there were supposed to be banshees? Where's the banshees?",

The movie is about two best friends in an argument that started over, essentially, nothing, but if you dig deeper you will see the story is a reflection of the civil war taking place on the Mainland, which is also a fight that started over, essentially, nothing.

You had incredible acting by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.  These two can make even bad writing interesting their acting was A+ these two are the rare actor who can play a tough guy, a nice guy, a funny guy most actors are pigeonholed to one kind of character. I don't think there is any role these two could not only take on the role but succeed at the highest level with it. To watch two of this generation's greatest actors I would recommend this film.

Vamos se dizer que me acostumei com o humor brasileiro. entretanto mesmo assim não posso deixar de destacar a falta de compreensão humorística do filme.\nTambém não posso deixar de falar sobre o desfecho. Posso descre-lo em apenas uma palavra: surpreendente.\nO filme, como eu disse anteriormente, tem um tom lento, que em minha opinião não me prendeu. Mas quando entramos na reta final, ele se dá uma alavancada incrível. De um humor falho filme se torna tenso e surpreendente. logo depois da morte de Jenny ( Quem viu saberá de quem eu me refiro) o camponês inocente se torna sagaz e complexo, ate mesmo ao ponto de assassinar alguém.\nResumindo tudo, o filme promete algo que no começo do longa não consegue cumprir, mas quase chegando no desfecho ele se torna totalmente tenso, ao ponto de prender totalmente a atenção do telespectador. o filme foi indicado ao Oscar mas não acho que ganhe, principalmente com o filme ´´tudo em todo lugar ao mesmo tempo´´ concorrendo´.",

Enraged at his dead donkey, he burns up the house of his friend who mutilated his own fingers hoping he would die there. Friend with self mutilated fingers doesn't die but suddenly seem to appreciate the guy who burnt down his house and stars talking to him again. Well that's all folks, that is the story.

In my opinion, some people are afraid to criticize this film because so many top reviewers said they loved it.  If it's a drama, it's stupid, if it's a dark comedy, it's not funny at all or dark.  The only horror in this film is wasting 2 hours.  I hope I'm not alone in this criticism.",

The removing of a finger, and then all fingers of Colm's hand signified to me how in the war, Ireland was administering harsh and unthinkable punishments on it's own people. The way Padraic went from being the nicest, friendliest (but a little dull) to being a mean and dangerous person (but still loved animals) spoke to me on how the conflict turned some good, everyday people bad, making them do horrible things themselves. I think the fact everyone still loved animals proved they were good people, but just lost and confused by circumstances. The dreadful police office - said a lot about authority.  The publican - everyone's friend. The snoopy general store owner, the sister - smarter than the lot of them, plus comradery v's the loneliness & sadness, the need for human connection and of cause the scenery - spectacular.

Farrell sometimes oversimplifies, like when pronouncing Beethoven so wrong that it loos ridiculous, but it doesn't happen that often and it certainly doesn't kill the story. Too obvious, theatric scenes could have also been reduced in intensity, but overall I believe the film to be of exceptional quality in its ideas, and the way they are presented, which is concise, but open enough to let the viewer add their own interpretation. \nThis is a film to watch with full attention. I often found myself rewinding to check a transition, or to re-appreciate and reaffirm the quality of the soundtrack, which is masterfully conceived as a feeling enhancer.\nNature, the mind of an animal, god, death, human existence, music, art, truth and justice, love and magic, are all elements present in this film. I recommend watching it.\n\nEdit: I read some of the reviews after writing this, and certainly didn't took this film as a comedy. It does have some really good, satisfying moments that would belong to the sort of ideal world typically depicted in comedy: the moments where the policeman gets what he deserves, for instance. I think I get why this could be seen as a comedy, but that is not the way I watched. Also, I didn't know anything about it beforehand.",

Padraic and Colm move back and forth along the spectrum between these two qualities.\nPadraic is also keen not to be the most stupid man on the island; that title is given to Dominic, the official village idiot, who is smarter than he seems, causing Padraic to worry about his own real status.\nA strong stomach is required occasionally, as the trailer will warn you, but this is not a macabre film; rather, it is a story about friendship and what's important in life.

            "content": "\"I don't like ya anymore.\" This simple gut punch is the spark that accelerates the chain of events that lead to self-mutilation, arson, and a dead donkey. The setting is the verdant fictional Irish island of Inisherin during the 1923 Irish Civil War — though none of that violence makes its way to the island, it's close enough that explosions can be heard from its shores. The day-to-day is almost fantastically Gaelic-bucolic — leading animals to pasture, writing elegiac songs for the violin, downing the same dark beer in the same dark pub. Pádraic (Colin Farrell) goes to heard his (supposed) friend, Colm (Brendan Gleeson) to the pub for their 2:00pm ritual. It's only back at the pub — and only after Colm treats Pádraic like a ghost — that Colm informs Pádraic that he no longer wants to speak to him. Not even a little. The Banshees of Inisherin is ripe with wholesome one-liners that are simple, yet witty. Both characters are gems — and somehow, the two most stubborn men in all of Ireland ended up on the same little island. Colm wants to \"leave something behind\" in the form of a song and finds Pádraic to be an aimless distraction keeping Colm from cementing his legacy. Pádraic just enjoys \"good, normal chattin\" — you can tell that his little home with his sister, his animals (especially, his beloved donkey named \"Jenny\"), and his chats at the pub with friends is satisfying life enough. You can understand both characters and if either just gave an inch (a hint, perhaps), they could both get what they wanted from each other. There are so, so many fantastic moments in this movie, but I keep finding myself returning to Pádraic's defense of \"niceness\". Barry Keoghan plays Dominic, a young lad who is beaten by his abusive father (Gary Lydon), seemingly the only police officer on the island. Keoghan possesses the ability to act using solely the bottom half of his face — it's something about the jaw. I first noticed it in The Killing of a Sacred Deer and it's even more pronounced here. I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like it before. **SPOILER ALERT** If there's one screenshot that captures the film, it's Colm conducting his troupe with a fingerless left hand, blood spattering across the sheet music on the pub table, with a dejected Pádraic standing over his shoulder in the background, having just entered the establishment. I have some catching up to do with 2022 movies, but as I write this, The Banshees of Inisherin is my favorite of the year and Best Film choice for the Oscars.",

Was a good example of the attention to detail when it came to making the speaking parts as authentic as possible.\n\nThe most noteworthy part about this movie, for me, is Colin Farrells unexpectedly brilliant performance. Not unexpected because I don't expect brilliance from him, but he was outstanding in this role and as someone who wasn't too hot on 'In Bruges', that came as a surprise. \n\nGleeson is equally great and menacing with his own peculiar intent.

To say the movie is dark and depressing is an understatement. These are about a group of Irish living on there small island off the coast of Ireland, where there's not much to do except go to church, hit the pub, usually at 2 p.m. every afternoon, and talk about the same things over and over again. Or talk about trivial things over and over again . . . so much so that one character simply ends a friendship because he no longer can listen to the man's palaver. In fact, he's willing to cut off a finger at a time to convince his ex-friend (Colin Farrell) that he no longer can stand his company. These are people who are stuck in their loneliness and do not have the \"inner resources\" to deal with their isolation from one another as well as themselves. Even some of the farm animals, particularly a miniature donkey, get  caught up in the darkness that seems to be everywhere. (Also of note, at least in terms of the way the film uses a Bergmann-like symbol in the dress and speech of an old woman they call the Ghoul; a Fellini-like symbol comes in the occasional explosion of cannon fire to the east of a \"war\" or rebellion that is due to cease any day now.) I did like this move, though honestly I doubt I'll ever sit through it again. Just about every aspect, great or small, about this movie rings true in most of our lives. Loneliness, the inarticulation of isolation that leads to rage--or the quiet moment where you either go mad and harm yourself . . . or take it out on anything you can get your hands on in the moment.",

Which perhaps also deserves a star, perhaps that's what it's supposed to do.\n\nThe scenery is gorgeous, long quiet shots, perfect for a grey Sunday afternoon in January. The score is elegant and unassuming, not at all pushy into your ears, but comes in assertively at exactly the right moments, ranging from traditional Irish folk music to opera and 1920s jazz. You're eyes or ears won't feel full, too full, visuals and sounds are just right, tactful.\n\nThe dialogue is as sparse, but as just right. People say the things need saying, although as a 21st century person with a couple of years of therapy under your belt you want to prescribe everyone a few months of group therapy to just learn how to talk to each other. But that's not the point of the film of course. There's charm in dysfunction to (if we don't have to experience it).\n\nThe acting is amazing, doesn't feel like acting at all, and Farell's hurt face that shows the pained bafflement of his character who just doesn't get what's going on, why his world is falling apart -- it's deeply moving. There's also some gentle comedy of manners with the worldly priest, evil policeman, gossipy shop owner, witchy old woman. All this is fun and deserves the label of comedy. But mostly this is *not* a comedy.\n\nApart from the allegory/allusions to the Irish Civil War  -- which I didn't entirely get as a non-Irishperson with limited knowledge about the post-1916 Ireland(s) -- the film shows how depression leaks into life poisoning those around you. If you don't do anything about it. That said from someone with medium depressive symptoms. The character of Colm projects his fears of death and despair at a meaningless life onto his former best friend, punishing Padraic for his own inability or unwillingness to engage with his issues. Padraic feels like a rug has been snatched from under his feet and refuses to accept his best friend's rejection. It's like a sudden unexpected break-up and it's insanely painful to watch Padraic's world unravel, and him lose his core kindness. \n\nPadraic gives a lovely speech on the value of kindness before everything, and this was touching and precious. People are also extremly bonded with their animals, which also offers some saving graces to this bleak and depressing film - yet enjoyable! If you know it's going to be emotionally tough, slowly unfolding, and leaving you feeling miserable and glad that it's over, you can actually enjoy it, and allow yourself space to experience difficult uncomfortable emotions.\n\nWe came out discussing the film, both feeling it was very good and very terrible at the same time. We still keep talking about it, and I've never been on rotten tomatoes but came here to talk about the film. So. It's a good film. In the manner of old, of greek Tragedy. It's work. Entertainment and work. As it should be",

Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson work so well together which is ironic because it's a movie about them not working well together. I mean what a great way to tell a story of depression and mental illness. This movie is a lot funnier than I was expecting until it takes a dark turn and then continues to take dark turns as you go on. The levels of escalation to the friendship issue are absurd. Kerry Condon is just as good as the boys if not better, really making a large part for herself in this story. Barry Keoghan really knows how to just melt into a role! His character is so different from any role of his I've seen before and a great role it is. Gary Lydon and Jon Kenny are wonderful supporting actors who give so much life to this island where it would be otherwise \"dull\". Sheila Flitton plays such an interesting character that adds a great level of mystery to the story. I loved seeing that the animals got an acting credit in this, the animals of the movie are fantastic and interact with the actors and the environment so well. And they're just so darn precious. I get why I've only heard good things about this movie and I'm really excited to see what Oscar nominations this will have and what it can win, this is going to be a very tough year because it's been such a great year. The Banshees of Inisherin is definitely going to be the top of a lot of lists for very good reason. From the acting and score to the excellent directing and the execution of that direction. This film is a beautiful story of mental illness set to the background of the Irish Civil War that just works on every level. I would definitely recommend giving this 10/10 of a movie a watch, I currently have it ranked at 6 for the year but we'll see what happens. Hop onto HBO Max and decide for yourself though. -Tyler.",

            "content": "The Banshees of Inisherin is a near flawless film. A film of great substance, humour and insight. One of the best films of 2022. Martin McDonagh makes films of greatness and this one might be his best yet. Set in 1923 on a remote island off the coast of Ireland it follows 4 people essentially. Padraic, a farmer, and his sister Siobhan. Colm, a musician and the younger Dominic, a dim lad from a troubled home. One day Colm tells Padraic that their friendship is over, instructing him to not speak to him again. Padraic is naturally bewildered. Even more so when Colm threatens to start cutting his fingers off if he is spoken to. It transpires that Colm is bored by life and Padraic's conversation. He wants more, he needs more. Set against the backdrop of the Irish Civil War, this film is about internal civil wars. It's about depression and loneliness and the tenuous bonds of friendship. Like McDonagh's other films, and plays, it is wickedly funny but also incredibly moving and at times desperately sad. Not a frame is wasted and even though it can be bleak at times it looks truly magnificent, showing off the beauty of the island setting. The score aids this beautifully too and the performances are just superb. Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are in career best form, whilst Kerry Condon is special as the sister who also desires more. And Barry Keoghan steals every scene he appears in. A film that rewards in every way possible.",

            "content": "As a huge fan of \"In Bruges\" and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", I was excited to see Martin McDonagh's \"The Banshees of Inisherin\". The film exceeded my expectations, not only because it feels more mature and focused in its storytelling than McDonagh's previous works, but also because it is more character driven and strikes the perfect balance between tragedy, human foibles, and acerbic, laugh-out-loud humor. This is quite the dark, cynical story to be sure, but at times I was cracking up at the behavior and motivations of the characters.\n\nTwo life-long best friends, played by Colin Farrell (in what might be his best performance to date) and Brendan Gleeson, live on the small Irish island of Inisherin and hit up the local pub every day at 2 p.m. Life is rather dull and everyone is privy to everyone else's business - you know, the typical small-town mentality and lack of boundaries. When Colm (Gleeson) decides to abruptly end his friendship with Pádraic (Farrell), the two become slowly disheveled and destructive.\n\nThe movie explores the deterioration of a friendship, but more so the reasons why people will self-destruct, and is a metaphor for the Irish Civil War. I loved the allegorical undertones in the movie such as the personification of Death in one particular character and all of the death motifs throughout. It's a movie that seems simple at first, but once you peel back all the layers, it's deeply poignant, sad, and packs an emotional wallop.",

This is such an interesting project when it comes to tone, a tragicomedy in a pastoral setting that deals with one man's sense of purpose and accomplishment clashing with another's contentment with simplicity; neither of them are necessarily wrong or unreasonable in their desires by principle alone, but their beliefs are now fundamentally irreconcilable, leading to conflict. The acting from both Gleeson and Farrell is so sincere, it really conveys what we don't see (the supposed years of sincere friendship, and the resolution of Gleeson's Colm) through the reactions that each deliver to the slightly absurdist premise - there are moments of great humor as Farrell's Pádraic tries to mimic what he thinks Colm wants to see, some emotional authenticity or sophistication that he has never had any use for, only to be faced with metaphorical doors being slammed harder and harder in his face. The dog dragging the shears out of Colm's house is brilliant, a moment of almost slapstick levity in a scene that has a guillotine hanging above it in terms of potential self-harm and Pádraic's inevitable desolation. One of the most character-driven films to come out in 2022. \n\nIt's a bit funny seeing Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell back together again, because In Bruges also had the pair opposite one another with one threatening himself with bodily harm to deter the other. Instead of a gun, this time it's sheep shears. (4.5/5)",

And it devolves into a black comedy, with self-mutilation, suicide, farm animals inside the house, arson, police brutality, and people with no apparent means of support, like jobs. At first, we think it is a better place, this island off the Irish west coast, a hundred years ago during the Irish civil war, enough so that they can see the mainland and hear explosions and even see smoke, so the war is raging. But the irony is that these off the beaten path people find ways to get into mischief and trouble maybe more than the more warlike, just a short haul across the lake. The key seems to be a raft of adults who feel the ennui, boredom of this insular place, to the extent that show-stealer, feisty but wounded Siobhan, Kerry Condon, finds a way out, more in a search for love than a new mainland job she is going to even with war raging nearby. The centerpiece is her brother, Farrell, Padraic, which the Irish pronounce like there is no \"d,\" and Gleeson, Colm, who are longtime friends who stop drinking together starting at 2 p.m. daily, because Colm, a fiddling songwriter wants to stop dealing with him because he doesn't like him anymore because he's boring, as he wants to focus on writing songs that live on. When Padraic starts bugging him about changing his mind, Colm says he will cut off his own fingers if Padraic won't leave him alone, an old Irish trick, if you don't do what I want or don't stop doing what I don't want, I will harm myself. Soon, the fingers start flying. When Padraic's prized miniature goat tries to eat one and chokes to death, they don't call them the fighting Irish for nothing. Padraic says he will burn down Colm's cottage tomorrow at 2, and if he is in it, well that's OK. And thus burns the home, but Colm lives. It is Barry Keoghan, a great young actor playing Dominic, the slow son of a drunken cop who beats him, and who had fallen for Siobhan, who is older than him, who tells her \"there goes my dream\" after she gently rejects him, whose remains are fished out of the lake.  Another key is that the priest asks Colm in confession how his despair is going, and Colm says he's pretty well lately, praise be. Siobhan had said all along that Colm is \"depressed\" and that all the men on the island are \"boring,\" which is more why she left than for a library job, a library symbolizing culture, learning, art, not superstition and tribalism. Banshees are spirits of Irish folklore who predict when someone is going to die, often in loud wails. An old lady on the island plays this role, accurately predicting a death. The point is that some Irish people had trouble adapting to change, losing friends, dealing with rejection, or just finding love and contentment, in this remote, rural place. Seems Colm really was in despair, depressed, though don't expect any Irish people of Inisherin to admit it. May the wind be at their back. Great acting, good production values, many funny lines, a dark look at life of some Irish or just people, and that black comedy is just a bit over the top, and it drags a tad. Kerry's Siobhan is impatient with not just foolishness but dark ages mores mostly of the men, and is very good. An Irish-American, my father, bless his soul, used to quip, \"You don't have to be dumb to be Irish, but it helps.\"",

Dominic, for example, is an incredibly moving and memorable portrayal of a nobody, with finesse and sensitivity. Even the animals become characters, without taking over. More than that, in a time when islands like Rathlin still preserve their own distinctiveness in relation to The Island, McDonagh nails the island life where 'word gets around' and news is ranked from 'news' to 'shite news' to 'no news at all'. \nThe only issue is that in a film set up for redemption, none ever quite achieve it. It does have an extraordinary beauty in seeking and finding the parity that can rescue a relationship's balance. However, as it does so we realize there is nothing redemptive in both descending to the same base level. Perhaps that is the one of the film's messages -- that by burning down your friend's house in revenge, one can rebuild nothing; in cutting off one's nose to spite one's face, there is no new path to lasting peace to be discovered. \nThe film's core tenet, meanwhile, that people are worth loving for their own genial banality, and that the appreciation of beauty is an indication that the same beauty resides within us, is one that pierces to the heart of all arts and debates and makes this movie soar. Two scenes in particular stand out (** spoilers***). One presents this point via the most simple yet scathing critique of the human construction of Catholicism, when a confessional priest asks Colm whether he thinks God gives a flying feck about little dead donkeys, and Colm answers that he fears He does not and that that is where it all went wrong. The other, after a long build up of the fear that Colm's music will be lost with his fingers, comes near the end, when Padraig encounters him in the pub jiving along as usual to the music circle, proving that limitations are often a product of the imagination and that all along, the music was actually within his soul.\nHere's to village elegies and to filmmakers who make a donkey's sudden decease cut far deeper than a human's inevitable culmination of suffering -- may we next have a comedy, please?!",

That plot is the spontaneous decision to end their friendship in the 1920's on a remote island in Ireland.  Brendan Gleason is the composer who decides to end his friendship with Colin Farrell.  Farrell does not understand, or accept, Gleeson's decision and this creates the volatile, tragic, and sometimes laughable chronology of events that unfold in this movie. The movie is beautiful and thoughtfully shot.  The small cast is all terrific. Barry Keoghan, of The Killing of The Sacred Deer, steals every scene he is in   This is a usual movie that keep you thinking and guessing throughout.",

My biggest issue with his work prior has been the tendency to generally view humanity as largely apathetic and cynical, our problems and despairs hopeless for true resolve. He weaves stories of that brand much better than most I'd usually call out for that sort of thing, however, I think Banshees of Inisherin is his best film on account that it uses that apathy and cynicism for a much more admirable cause of examining the ways in which those things manifesting in people can set off chain reactions of destructive and self destructive behavior. It's a film that greatly speaks to our inherent need for connection, friendship, and community and the things we're capable of doing to ourselves and others without it. Very witty, Irish as they get, subtle and tender in its depiction of depression and isolation, but even at its most tragic still manages to squeeze in a few good laughs.

Maybe even some poetic revelations on the relationships, the joys and the struggles of the Irish in the 1920s. That expectation was slowly and steadily dismissed as the story progressed.\n\nThe actors all performed their roles effectively, where the sister, Kerry Condon, was by far the most nuanced of the other, fairly monotonous characters. Barry Keoghan also added some personality to the story. The setting delivered with its sedate beauty throughout the film. But the culprit was the writing, or lack thereof. It may have just been that they wanted a vehicle for the ambience of the Irish country side. But that would have been better served by excluding what grew into progressively inane dialog and then some sadly deranged plot turns. I'm not sure what spark of inspiration prompted the film.

There he comes to know that Colm doesn't want to be friends with him anymore. Clueless Pádraic didn't understand the reason behind such a massive step and tries to dissolve the situation by apologizing and talking to his dear friend. Contrary to his efforts, the more he tries to talk to Colm, the more the situation worsens, and that further leads to devastating events in both of their lives.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin is an extremely beautiful film, both from a story as well as a scenic perspective. The screenplay is so smooth that one doesn't even realize the passing minutes of the runtime. The cinematography is brilliant. The wide-angle shots of captivating landscapes with cloudy sky and seashore give a soothing experience.\n\nMcDonagh's direction is top class and he has masterfully created a mesmerizing world around us in this film.\nOn one end, the story's simplicity gives a touch of authenticity to the film; on the other hand, the diligent character development & careful writing, make the characters more real than fictional.\nEvery moment and conversation has been used efficiently to develop the story and take it further. Everything happening on the screen makes sense. Since McDonagh himself has written the film, he embraces the characters with the utmost care, and it's evident, too, throughout the film when as a viewer we can relate to the characters and the situations. Even smaller role characters are written with interesting character arcs.\n\nWhen such a talented cast is onboard, you can expect top-notch performances. Colin Farrell once again gives an Oscar-worthy performance with an extremely powerful portrait of his character. You can literally feel his anguish and emotions. Brendan Gleeson is equally outstanding with his marvellous dialogue delivery and character portrayal. Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan are the scene stealers and make their characters memorable even with limited screen time.\n\nThis comedy-drama, under the carpet, is actually more of a tragic tale. There are metaphors, but one doesn't need to dwell too deeply to understand them. They have been laid out in simpler ways here. There are plenty of scenes that would make you laugh, but at the same time, there are many that would make you sad. The film explores various underlying themes like loneliness, sadness, love, and friendship under the umbrella theme of human relationships.\n\nAt the end of the day, I see The Banshees of Inisherin as a film that everyone would appreciate in one way or the other. It's smartly written, brilliantly directed, and passionately portrayed. It's a fascinating piece of cinema and every frame in it is simply admirable.\n\nFollow me on Instagram/Letterboxd: m_movie_reviews\nRating: 8.3/10",

I think he probably should do that for every acting role he has and he will continue to win awards. He has such a tragic face. Brendan Gleeson was also very tragic, as was mostly everyone on this god-forbidden island.

The man who no longer wants Ferrelle’s company (Brendan Gleason), lives alone in a house by the sea, in a place filled with opera music on an old gramophone, and carved masked and other art items. The story progresses as the island’s other denizens watch the strange twists and turns as each day passes. There is blood, gruesomeness, and dark comedy. There is a malignant cop who molests his teenaged son, a priest with a foul mouth and an arrogant attitude, and a shopkeeper who lives to gossip.

He takes a simple yet rich setting and turns it into a grand social experiment. The entire production is award worthing from costume design to cinematography. McDonagh's direction is purposeful yet subtle. The dialogue is so brilliant and watching the actors tackle it is like watching a boxing match of powerful, endless punches with neither side yielding.

The talent and pedigree of Farrell, Gleason and Condon are evident every step of the way.  The rest of the characters are also well played.  This movie moves as slow as Ireland in the 80's and 90's and the views are as majestic as ever.  The laughs stem mostly from tragedy and cruelty but the Irish are best at making fun of the Irish so it really lands accurately.  If you want a feel good \"Quiet Man\" experience this wont do it but its certainly worth a look into island life in mid 1920's.  Not much different than living in Wisconsin, Nevis, or New Orleans on a Monday.  Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride because this isn't to be taken too seriously.  As for Condon, she is a gem and a sweetheart and she kinda saves the film from its slow burn gloom.  The witch is also an interesting character and her ability to see the future is indicative of her intelligence and observational skill.  The story is really her point of view and it helps add that touch of magic and lore that is omni present on the Emerald Isle to this day.",

However, \"The Secret of Roan Inish\" it definitely ain't.  It's not for everyone, and there are some really gruesome moments, and if you're looking for an upbeat happy ending look somewhere else, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nBy the way, I play fiddle myself, and up until this movie I don't believe I'd ever seen a violin played on-screen where the player was actually playing what was on the soundtrack.  Brendan Gleeson, however, absolutely was.  It wasn't necessarily him playing; it could have been another fiddler bow-syncing to what he played, or him bow-syncing to a previously made recording, or something like that, but there's no doubt at all that he plays fiddle well enough to play those tunes, some of which were pretty up-tempo.

I really like Brendan Gleeson (ever since he played Mad Eye Moody in the Goblet of Fire, for which he should have at least been nominated for an Academy Award! Really, go take a look at that character - he's playing a VERY quirky character who was ACTUALLY someone else!). The chemistry between him and Colin Farrell is sublime and the whole story, village, characters is extremely well protrayed and presented! The ending was mildly, very mildly disappointing. But that is just the typical shallow me wanting it all tied up in a bow.

The other identifies him as his only friend and cannot come to accept  this new order in his own non existence of a life and the situation spirals into violence and loss. A well crafted film but bleak . A few laughs along the way , but also issues of child abuse, loneliness, depression and isolation to counter those odd lighter moments.\nAnother great pairing of the Gleason and Farrell, with a strong supporting cast.

            "content": "In 2008, Tony award-winning Irish playwright Martin McDonagh demonstrated how effectively his skills could translate to the big screen.  The film was \"In Bruges\" and it starred Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.  In \"The Banshees of Inisherin,\" the two actors are again paired together.  But \"Banshees\" should offer a disclaimer:  Not all items are as interesting as they initially appear.\n\nIn this film, McDonagh has traded the iconic Belfrey Tower of Bruges for an imaginary island off the coast of Ireland.  The date is April, 1923.  Early on, we learn that Colm (Gleeson) wants to sever all contact with his longtime friend Padraic (Farrell) because he finds him terminally dull.  (He has a point.)  Colm says he wants to spend his remaining time on earth building a legacy by writing music, not engaging in trivial conversation with his friend.  He's so serious about it that he tells Padraic he will cut off one of his own fingers with a set of shears the next time Padraic intrudes.  Because this is a McDonagh film, one townsperson observes, \"Would you not want him to have to do the one finger, to see if he was bluffing like? ... He can still play the fiddle with four fingers, I bet you.\"  And because this is a McDonagh film, violence is always simmering just beneath the surface.  Friendship isn't the only thing that eventually gets brutally severed.\n\nI attended this screening with high expectations, having deeply admired \"In Bruges\" as well as McDonagh's other films \"Seven Psychopaths\" and \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\"  I've seen each of them more than once.  \"Banshees\" tones down the violence of McDonagh's previous films, settling for tossing verbal rather than literal grenades.  But while it examines Colm and Padraic from every possible angle, these central characters are too profoundly depressed (Colm) or too lacking in self-awareness (Padraic) to be deeply interesting or to represent some larger point.  There's a lot of morose moping in search of a purpose.  Some critics have pronounced in authoritative tones that the relationship between Colm and Padraic is a metaphor for the Free Staters versus the IRA during the Irish Civil War.  If that's the case, McDonagh needs to sell the idea with more than occasional gunfire in the background.  Turns out, this historical context (\"1920s Irish History for $200, please, Alex\") is not a strong point for some moviegoers.\n\nThere are a few bright spots.  The lingering aerial shots of the Irish countryside are spectacular.  McDonagh's masterful writing skills are on full display.  The dialogue is densely clever, when it's not being cleverly dense.  And there is a small ray of hope: one character, Padraic's sister Siobhan (a scene-stealing Kerry Condon – \"Better Call Saul,\" \"Three Billboards,\" \"Ray Donovan\"), has the good sense to pack her bags and leave for the mainland and a chance at sanity.  She writes back to Padraic reflecting amazement that her new locale includes townspeople who smile on occasion.\n \nBut for the most part, the characters in \"Banshees\" seem intent on manifesting every possible sign of clinical depression (although, in fairness, some characters shift to a generalized sense of despair, just for a change of pace).  \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is not a sojourn to an idyllic isle.  Ultimately, this is Brigadoon with minimal singing, no dancing and no Cyd Charice.",

It aims at and hits an unerring bullseye at small town life on an island just off the coast of Ireland. Never having visited the emerald isle myself the seascapes and breathtaking vistas matched all my expectations of what an Irish isle I thought would look like. In fact, I would posit the location set in 1923 used throughout the film is a character as much as any of the actor portrayals. It's a rough, isolated place to live.\n\nAt its essence this is the story of the sudden, seemingly inexplicable breakup of a friendship. And while it is filled with heartbreak, it's a heartbreak we can all relate to. Everyone of us, if you dig down in your memory lane there undoubtably has had some rocky roads in friendships. In fact, many have had to make the decision on whether to continue with a dubious friendship. It's that decision around which this film turns. But don't be misled this is merely a dour and depressing film, far from it. I haven't laughed out loud in a movie, along with the rest of the audience in a long, long time. It is a complex mixture of highs and lows that draws upon countless emotions buried within and on our surface.\n\nAmid all the world-saving, super hero, special effect laden mega-blockbusters that seem to be the only movie fare available, this is an intimate picture. In fact, it seems almost like a play. There are only two main characters with the rest of the town's folk in small but crucial roles serving as something not unlike a Greek chorus ushering along the storyline. The dictionary defines banshee as a \"female spirit in Gaelic folklore whose appearance or wailing warns a family that one of them will soon die.\" There's one of these too.\n\nNow onto the perfect cast. In a completely surprising, unexpected wonderful turn is Colin Farrell (Padraic). Primarily a leading \"modern actor\" Farrell fits comfortably into this small-town vulnerable good guy role. His life is fulfilled with low expectations. He's buddies with a lifelong best friend. Visiting the local pub and downing pints of Guinness with his pal is a life well lived. Though the jury is out on whether he's dim or dumb … he is satisfied. He lacks an imagination to dream of better things. Still, it's hard to find fault with a satisfied person in this world. I for one was a little envious of that minimalist approach. But all that comes to an end when their friendship hits a stone wall.\n\nThat metaphorical wall is Padriac's friend Colm (Brendon Gleeson). What a face. Gleeson is one of those gifted actors whose expressions convey many things, sometimes more than one at the same time. Colm is a complex man caged by a simple life … and he wants out. You feel his angst but not the extreme expression of it. Be prepared.\n\nI went with a lifelong buddy. Afterward I asked if he like it. He confessed he wasn't sure he understood it. He admitted he primarily goes to movies for entertainment and this was a bit of a challenge. That challenge is what I crave and for me is missing from many movies. However, I don't feel the two viewpoints have to be mutually exclusive. But to our friendships credit we had a great dinner talking over the interpretations of the film which was a feast for me and I think he enjoyed our talk too.\n  \nTwo warnings you'll be glad I mentioned. Pay attention. The characters talk with an Irish brogue. Have faith that your ear will attune to it quickly. In fact, the screenplay author had enough sense to allow characters to repeat certain phrases as an aural footnote to help you get the point or joke. I'll even help. In the beginning is the phrase, \"Did you have a row.\" The pronunciation of row is like nothing I've ever heard but you quickly get it as it's repeated by nearly everyone in the pub. The second warning is of a scene of self-harm. I won't go beyond that. Go see the film if you want to get my reference or, read some other reviewer who has no compunction about including spoilers in their reviews. That shall not pass here.",

            "content": "It's not a comedy in the American sense though there are funny bits throughout if you enjoy dry humor (I do). Rather, it is largely a drama filled with dark/taboo humor. Banshees has a gifted cast with an absolute standout performance by Barry Keoghan as Dominic, the only character I was able to truly have empathy for. Kerry Condon as Siobhan (sister to protagonist Colon Farrell's Padraic) delivers an excellent performance and approaches being an empathetic character except the story is not about her. It could be. Retelling the story of an isolated life on an Irish island from Siobhan's POV with the dark antics or Padraic and antagonist Colm (Brendan Gleeson) would have been a more compelling story and still allowed the filmmaker to explore the themes of mortality, friendship, and contentment. As it is, though, the film is dark, not breathtaking in its cinematography, and slower than it needs to be to convey the mood or setting. The moments of comedic relief are genuinely funny for those who enjoy dry humor as I mentioned. But the story meanders along and gives too much attention to certain set details that add no value to the story itself. It's not a majestic piece of cinematography that will stun you though the setting is beautiful. It's not a dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of being uncomfortable yet still delivers morose humor. It isn't entirely a drama because the story and a particular disturbing plot element border on the ridiculous (I left early after one gruesome and inexplicably weird moment). And while the characters have the potential for depth and whose performances are the only thing that kept me in my seat as long as I did, their arcs are never fully realized and they don't become dimensional or empathetic characters save Dominic. Ultimately, I don't feel the elements came together.",

All of the performances are stellar and the actors give so much personality to them, making the fictional island of Inisherin feel populated and alive. The cinematography and production design does a lot to capture the life and beauty of the town, with a nice focus on natural lighting from candles, fire and leaking sunbeams. Carter Burwell's score is playful and communicates the conflicting tone of comedy and despair that permeates the film.

All the way back to Braveheart and later in Calvary, In Bruges, and The Guard. All the actors are terrific, and every main character is interesting in their own way. Sometimes bleak and sad, but always interesting. This movie is about profound loneliness and isolation. Friendship and the fragility of friendships. Pettiness and the tragic results of pettiness escalated in a very narrow world. Self-introspection and the transference of disappointment onto others. One character in the movie actually comes up with the courage to leave and find her happiness off the island in the bigger world. A very intelligent film.

Perhaps it tries to convey a useful message about meaningfulness in life--but it fails. The entire core of the movie is more like the empty heart and soul of a senselessly abusive person: cruelty and heartlessness result in more cruelty and heartlessness. Those of us who experience depictions of abuse (shunning, neglect, severe child beating, and horrific self-mutilation) as triggering should avoid this film. I started crying before 20 minutes, and had to step outside for air after about an hour. I had been looking forward to visiting Ireland someday; now I'm  going to have to try to de-associate the images of beautiful scenery with emotional agony. From what I've read, Ireland experienced decades of pain, betrayal, and an endless variety of injuries both psychic and physical, all inflicted by brother on brother. Perhaps this film is the perfect expression of those scars, but I'm not convinced it needed to be so traumatic. One of the professional critics said he might call this a horror film--keep that in mind before you see a film about friendship and kindness morphing into depravity.",

Similar in many ways to McDonagh's In Bruges from fourteen years earlier, The Banshees of Inisherin is filled with memorable dialogue, original ideas, strong performances throughout, lovely landscapes and stunning cinematography.

Beautiful, yet ugly. Hilarious, yet horrific. If there's any work in this filmmaker's oeuvre that I think is the perfect, most simple distillation of his voice/tonal DNA, it has to be this.

            "content": "Sometimes the simplest of films can become one of the best of its consecutive year, or even an already great filmmaker's finest work. Martin McDonagh is one of my favourite working directors today. Whether you're talking about his excellent and hilarious debut with In Bruges back in 2008, or his award-worthy Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri in 2017, he is a filmmaker that hasn't made a single film that wasn't at least very, very good, at least to me. The Banshees of Inisherin marks his latest directorial effort and arguably his best. It's been a while since I went to the theatre and felt the filmmaking just leaping off the screen, but this one did that for me. \n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin follows Pádraic (Colin Farrell) as he lives a straightforward life on a small island in Ireland called Inisherin. Drinking at the local pub on a daily basis and only having one lifelong friend in Colm (Brendan Gleeson), he quickly learns that Colm no longer wishes to be his friend. Colm has his reasons, but they really don't make any logical sense, thus sparking Pádraic's confusion and curiosity. Colm's one request is that Pádraic just stop talking to him altogether, otherwise he is threatening to harm himself. That's it, that's the only story to this film, other than the very incredible dialogue that makes it all worth it.\n\nThis film is a masterwork in how well a movie can work if you have great characters. Pádraic and Colm are both very well written and Farrell and Gleeson both give arguably their best performances here. They both had me laughing hysterically and feeling awful at the same time. There were multiple occasions where the film was too funny to not laugh, but the subject matter was very dark, so I felt bad for doing so, and that to me was the brilliance of this film. The dialogue was the driving force here and that aspect was perfection to me. \n\nMartin McDonagh also wrote the screenplay for this film, which really makes me believe he won't ever make a bad movie. He has a knack for writing some of the most clever dialogue out there and his work throughout the years only seems to improve. He can also work exceptionally well with actors, which is why a film like this turns out so well with him behind the wheel. Everything from the camerawork to the subtle score, The Banshees of Inisherin, although dark and funny, is a masterwork of filmmaking, especially when it's such a simple premise. This is also a much darker film than any of his previous work, but that made the final act feel authentic to this story. I really don't have anything to complain about here.",

The Banshees of Inisherin finds two long-time best friends of sort no longer mates as one, Brendan Gleeson's Colm, has had his fill of Colin Farrell's Pádraic. Seems Pádraic is one boring fella when it comes to the chatting, and Colm now wants to make more of his time and sitting with this dull bloke at the pub or wherever they're conversing. Namely, he wants to work on composing more on his fiddle. \nThe two begin to have a sort of clash, which is analogous with the civil war currently occurring on the mainland of Ireland. As with wars, things begin with small skirmishes and build up to full-on assaults. Colm threatens to hack off a digit if Pádraic doesn't cease and desist with all his talking to him. He does so briefly before launching into an angry rant at Colm, which then leads the latter to indeed follow through with his amputation.\nAs dark and miserable as this all sounds, it's a Martin McDonagh film, so the humor's gonna be there, but you have to sense it at times, cuz this is not stuff that hits you over the head. Dark/black humor is more subtle, and indeed works best if you have a good bit of it already in your reserve along with a lot of experience in using and appreciating it. \nThe supporting cast is excellent. Kerry Condon as Pádraic's suffering sister who is told 'no one likes (her). Shortt's bartender, Pearse as the priest, along with Kenny and Lydon flesh out key parts so well. And then there's Sheila Fitton as the ominous, seer type Mrs. McCormick and Barry Keoghan as another oddball outcast. Both are very effective in their specific characters. Fitton brings s cold, callous sense to Mrs. McCormick, who annoys as much as puts off her fellow islanders. Keoghan nearly steals whole scenes at times with his combination of convincing dullard and all his nervous fidgeting facial expressions. \nAnd the island itself is something of a character, with its blanket of lush green fields and yards, the small rural homes, JJ. Devine's pub, and the verging sea. \nGreat stuff by McDonagh, cast, and crew. 3.8 stars",

Martin Mcdonagh is still outstanding as a scriptwriter but this is definitely his best work as a director. With each film, he becomes more decisive with each frame of the work, and the banshees absolutely show that. From the tiny detail that in the background that symbolizes the dialogue, to how the terrain displays the character's way of life, he really has mastered it. The score is great as it effectively captures the sound of the mystery of the events and the island of inisherin. The cinematography is also excellent at exhibiting the beauty of Ireland. I did find it to be a slower film than Mcdonagh's previous works, but in this case, it is needed, this isn't a story of just any old friendship, this is the story of two best friends splitting. Colin Farrell perfectly encapsulates Padric, using everything in his acting arsenal to get down to very intricate details. Brendan Gleeson rises as Colm, portraying a man trying to look more sophisticated than he actually is. Everyone is perfectly cast in this and does everything in their power to contribute to this great movie. This was truly a great film for Mcdonagh and just makes me more excited for what he has next, which we will probably see in 5 years.",

The black comedy reunites leads Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson with McDonagh, who directed them both in his 2008 Oscar-nominated film \"In Bruges\". After it's world premiere at this year's Venice International Film Festival, the film went on to receive a rapturous 15-minute standing ovation, five minutes longer than McDonagh's previous film \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\". \n\nThe film takes place in 1920s Ireland, against the backdrop of the Irish Civil War, on the fictional island of Inisherin and tells the story of two friends Pádraic (Farrell) and Colm (Gleeson). One day, Colm decides to abruptly end his long-running friendship with Pádraic, claiming the man is ‘too dull' for him to spend the rest of his life around. An escalating battle then begins between the two friends, and it soon becomes the talk of the village, with many just as confused as Pádraic with Colm's decision. As the growing tensions between the two grow, it's not long before it boils over and results in devastating consequences for both feuding men. \n\nColin Farrell leads an uber-talented cast comprised of some of Ireland's greatest talents like Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan, all delivering knockout performances. Farrell's work is almost certain to land him a spot in this year's Best Actor line-up as he plays Pádraic, the harmless easy-going farmer, until he finally snaps and becomes a ruthless man out for revenge, and perhaps that's what makes his performance so fascinating to watch unfold on the big screen. The friendship Farrell shares with his co-star Brendan Gleeson elevates both performances making them feel much more authentic and believable. The pair share a hilarious back and forth that's embellished by McDonagh's screenplay. Gleeson's role as Colm, a man who finds himself in the later years of his life wishing to be more creative, and have more interesting conversations with those around him, is terrific and perfectly compliments Farrell's performance. The film's other standout performance, alongside Farrell's, comes from Kerry Condon. The Irish actress, probably best known for voicing ‘Friday' in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, gives a marvellous turn as Pádraic's sister, Siobhan. Condon ends up acting as a mediator between the two men, trying to keep them apart to prevent Colm from resorting to drastic action. Condon boosts every scene she's in to a whole other level and she ends up being one of the best parts of the film. \n\nDirector Martin McDonagh pens a screenplay that balances side-splitting hilarity with tear-jerking emotion and reminds you exactly why he has two Oscar-nominations for writing under his belt. It's sharp, witty, and brilliantly tells the story of what happens when a friendship turns sour. McDonagh does a skilful job blending the comedic tones at the start of the film with the tragedy and drama that becomes more dominant towards the end. This balance, combined with McDonagh's sensational directorial effort, makes \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" such a unique and entertaining film. Perhaps what else makes the film so good, and sets it apart from a large majority of this year's awards contenders, is that it isn't an intricate biopic about a famous figure or some overbearing think piece, but is instead a rich, amusing film about friendship. \n\n\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" brings some delightful visuals to the screen alongside the engaging narrative and likeable characters. Cinematographer Ben Davis, who worked with McDonagh on \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\", uses the scenic Irish coastlines to his advantage to effortlessly enhance the natural beauty of the film.\n\n\"The Banshees of Inisherin\" easily sets itself up to be one of 2022's best and most entertaining films. With shining performances from the cast, and a simple plot with changing tones, the film is a solid original dark comedy from acclaimed director Martin McDonagh. A simple, yet distinctive depiction of the end of a friendship, \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" is beautifully tied together, while also being incredibly charming and amusing, and a brilliant follow up to \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\".",

In the film, in which no idea is glorified or criticized, the effect of knowledge on people is examined. The movie, in which the centuries-old fight between people who read and people who don't read is reenacted on a small island, shows us that we need to make radical decisions, even if it sometimes upsets some people or frightens us. When Einstein said that people are divided into two, the good and the bad, he didn't say that the good should be boring. The main priority in this life is ourselves, and to make ourselves happy, we should be in places where we will be satisfied and do things that make us happy. While Siobhan sees the benefits of his radical decision, Colm, unfortunately, has to struggle with Padraic's obsessions and manages to reach the happiness he seeks, even if a few fingers are missing.",

McDonagh for Best Director. They deserve the Oscar sweep last seen by Silence of the Lambs. Continuing, Kerry Condon is brilliant, she brings the magic that keeps the movie going in a fantastic place. Barry Keoghan is phenomenal... he's clearly autistic but with the wiseness that people don't understand. The open ending makes me know that Colm (Gleeson) needed a place to stay after the fiery ending. What a magnificent ending it would've been if Colm asked for a place to stay and he slept in Siobhán's now-empty bed. Highly recommend! The cinematography is next level Oscar winning stuff. The scene where Pádraic buries a certain furry someone was beautifully shot. What a magnificent display of Irish Life in 1923.

            "content": "Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh returns to his homeland after his Oscars success with his last film 5 years ago and it's a triumphant return, with a profound and exceptionally crafted screenplay that works on multiple levels, whether it's simply a story about the dramatic fallout after a life-long friendship breaks up out of the blue, or a deep dive into a character's battle with despair and mortality, or even as a metaphor for Ireland and their troubles since the Civil War, which coincidentally plays in the background of this film as an ominous reminder that constantly haunts its characters. Reuniting Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson from McDonagh's own In Bruges, they're the two central contrasting characters living on a remote island village off the Western coast of Ireland in 1923, whose friendship is unilaterally terminated by Gleeson's Colm to the horrors and bafflement of Farrell's Padraic. Easing us in with lively interactions sprinkled with laugh-out-loud Irish humour and stereotypes, and Ben Davis' calming and sumptuous cinematography that makes the best out of the picturesque landscape available, it builds on its engaging and straightforward premise organically, evolving incrementally in a dramatic and increasingly serious manner, before reaching a vicious yet melancholic conclusion. Basically, it begins as Father Ted but ends in Sunday Bloody Sunday and every laugh feels infused with pathos and the funniest characters wind up inhabiting the most tragic arc. Conveying complex emotions brilliantly, Farrell and Gleeson are on top form here, while Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan's scene-stealing support will not go unnoticed. Accompanied by an exquisite score by Carter Burwell that goes beyond Irish diddly music, this is an elegant and graceful film that one can enjoy and appreciate on so many different levels, it literally is the definition of thought-provoking.",

I think that's the main reason you keep thinking about it afterwards.  It haunts you.  A high point of the year.

It is also triggering if you have not seen Halloween films for a long time with some gore. I feel like the film editors could have edited out the redness from that scene. Comedy => turned dreary film sullen depressing , only fit for mature audiences. I do think a play could be better than the film in a local theatre. Props to the directors.",

There are some funny episodes along the way but too spread out . The wife was not happy and now i am sad and depressed because she is.
