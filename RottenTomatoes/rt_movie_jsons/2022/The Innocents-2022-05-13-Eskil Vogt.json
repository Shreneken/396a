The Innocents is really captivating and disturbing, and full of that peculiar madness that is often present in horror movies from northern Europe. It's the kind of film that cannot be copy-pasted. \n\nThe story itself might not make much sense and the film does not really explain much of what happens, but is told in a way that really conveys the right emotions. Also, suberb acting from all those kids.",

The younger sister is someone caught between good and evil, and who has to choose her path in life, and come to terms with her own past actions.

That makes a lot of sense because this screenwriter, Eskil Vogt, was co-writer on all of Trier's full-length films up to now. \nVogt has clearly learned crucial aspects of filmmaking, such as tone, editing, working with actors to bring about the maximum effect of the story and the ideas/themes he wants to express. The tone is set right away in \"The Innocents\" and is maintained throughout, with measured degrees of intensity and foreboding when needed. There is also no real chaff here. I didn't get any sense of unneeded scenes, subplots, lingering too long on any one event or scene.\nThe acting is remarkable. These kids- Fløttum, Ashraf, Bremseth Asheim, and esp. Brynsmo Wansted-  give the viewer the impression of  very assured, experienced performers. They come off as so natural and authentically kids, with all the wonder, laughter, parental need, and certainly the struggles with controlling their emotions.\nI loved this story. The relationship between Anna and Aisha was so sweet and sincere. It was such a warm, satisfying feeling when Anna and Ida's mother learns that Anna truly is better. \nYeah, the Ben character is a brutal one, all resentment from his abusive mother and teenage hormones mixing with his frustrations and confusion to fuel such rage. But Ashraf pulls it off so well.\nLoved the ending, too. Well done, Mr. Vogt, in the writing and directing. Gonna see your other film soon, I hope. 4.2 stars",

Alongside Joachim Trier, he wrote one of the most depressing trilogies in cinema's history (\"Reprise\", \"Oslo, August 31st\" and \"The Worst Person in the World\", a.k.a. the \"Oslo Trilogy\"). Now, with \"The Innocents\", I must also recognize his talent as a director. This is the most disturbing movie of the year until now; like his partner, Vogt knows how to create a very dense atmosphere. The pace is incredibly dynamic (time flew for me), the balance between horror and cuteness is perfect, and like in the movies directed by David Charbonier and Justin Powell (\"The Djinn\" and \"The Boy Behind the Door\"), the situations are even tenser because the protagonists are children. And what a fantastic quartet: Ida (Rakel Lenora Flottum) is an excellent protagonist, as she represents the kid who is learning not only her place in the world and not only what's right and what's wrong, but also mainly how to live together with her autistic sister Anna (Alva Brynsmo Ramstad), who also has a great character development; the other two are Ben (Sam Ashraf), who is macabre, and Aisha (Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim), who is the cutest thing on Earth and has the coolest power. The photography is also incredible, and I'll always praise the guys who can create a convincing horror atmosphere in a movie that takes place almost 100% in daylight.

This relationship shapes the thumping heart of the story, as Ida's stewing disdain at remembering Anna for her recess begins to move and melt away after they get to know two different youngsters, Aisha and Ben. Their new companions are just barely finding stowed away powers. How they decide to utilize them will make them pulverize outcomes. It's this interesting high-wire balance between the thought of good and abhorrent, seen through the straightforward focal point of a drop in the bucket, which is so impeccably delivered here. The environmental cinematography and sound and the critical exhibitions from this youthful cast drive this powerful spine-chillinger home. I really do deem it should be extremely clear that this film isn't a great fit for everybody. There are some encounteringly dreadful and possibly upsetting minutes, and in some ways or another, everything generally feels undeniably more stacked when told through the eyes of kids. Yet, for those who love their films to investigate and push the limits of their faculties in new and important ways, \"The Innocents\" on the big screen is most certainly for you.",

            "content": "The Innocents follows four children who become friends during the summer holidays. Out of sight of the adults, they discover they have hidden powers. While exploring their newfound abilities in the nearby forests and playgrounds, their innocent play takes a dark turn and strange things begin to happen.\n\nEven though a vast majority of the film's most crucial elements take place out of sight of the adults, The Innocents is a look at the various methods of parental nurturing and fostering the ability for the children to become their best selves. Three vastly disparate families with different ethnicities, backgrounds, and social situations yields an environment for conflicting approaches to the kid's newfound abilities. For every groan and eyeroll for a superhero movie that spouts about the responsibility that great power brings, this film is a direct response to what happens when power is bestowed upon people too young to fully comprehend its capacity and potential. The Innocents is a story about exactly that; the loss of innocence as unchecked power is given an environment to manifest and fester, and the unfortunate consequences that follow.\n\nStarring Rakel Lenora Fløttum, The Innocents starts as an analysis of Ida, a girl moving with her family to a new town. The idea of neglect is the central issue as the audience is privy to Ida's treatment of her older sister Anna (Ramstad), who lives with autism, demanding more care and attention from their parents. Fløttum as Ida is an absolute nightmare of a kid, inflicting any number of horrible acts upon her unsuspecting sister and her streak of cruelty is shown time and again. Fløttum delivers a magnificent performance that takes a full arc throughout the course of the film with a wide array of conflicting emotions that play out in both verbal and nonverbal cues. Ben, the first new kid she meets played by Sam Ashraf, veers in the opposite trajectory as Ida; after the initial bond is created, it's clear to see that the same dark current of cruelty Ida possesses also runs through Ben yet stemming from different circumstances. Ashraf is brilliant as the tortured young boy; with cold eyes and a colder demeanor, Ben's menace is possibly the creepiest aspect of the film.\n\nAlso starring Alva Brynsmo Ramstad as Anna, Ida's sister, the actress tasked with the hardest role in the film: playing a non-verbal autistic character who slowly comes into her own as the kid's powers develop. While a neurotypical actress to play an autistic character could be seen as problematic, Vogt handles the characterization deftly, making sure Ramstad doesn't veer into a cliche of the illness, a la Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. With the material she's given, and the direction from Vogt, Ramstad turns in a stellar performance, transitioning into an awakening and awareness that is both stirring and heartbreaking. Rounding out the cast of kids that gain these strange powers is Aisha, played by Mina Yasmin Bremseth Asheim, who spends most of her time communing with Anna. Asheim, possibly the youngest, but by far the wisest of the group, is an old soul stuck in a young person's body. Asheim plays the role with an extreme clarity, the heart of the group that is the first to push back against Ben's whims. Aisha's bond with Anna is one of the sweetest aspects of the movie, facilitating not just a change in Anna but also a change in Ida's relationship with Anna.\n\nDirected by Eskil Vogt, who spent a majority of his career co-writing movies with director Joachim Trier (to include the 2021 darling The Worst Person in the World), The Innocents marks Vogt's shift into directing for himself. Starting with this simple, well thought out low-stakes film, Vogt shows a keen eye for mood and atmosphere, pulling incredibly haunting performances from his cast of young children. From a writing standpoint, Vogt's ability to knit three different familial stories into an overarching theme of being a product of environment is subtly and superbly handled. Directing wise, the filmmaker appears nearly fully formed after spending the better part of two decades with Trier, an accomplished director in his own right. Here, Vogt manages to unravel the supernatural mystery with a pacing that keeps the viewer on the hook to find out who will be left standing at the film's end.\n\nOverall, The Innocents is one of the more sinister movies to be released in the United States this year. The unsettling creepiness Vogt manages to convey compliments the equally creepy performances from the actors. With clean, often visually arresting cinematography, sensible low budget effects, and a quiet, thoughtful examination of the nature of family, the movie is a quiet gem hidden amongst the raucous, explosion filled blockbusters that rule the summer.",
