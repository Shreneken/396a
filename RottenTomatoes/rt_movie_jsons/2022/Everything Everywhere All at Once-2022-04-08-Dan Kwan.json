Everything from the story, the themes, the writing, the acting, and the editing makes this movie a masterpiece of cinema. The film tackles themes such as depression, nihilism, existentialism, family dynamics, and many more, with a touch of brilliant comedy sprinkled throughout. Michelle Yeoh put on a tour-de-force performance for the ages, and she deserved every award that she won. The same can be said of Ke Huy Quan. I've seen iconic movies from Citizen Kane, Vertigo, The Godfather, Goodfellas, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Schindler's List, The Shawshank Redemption, and Back to the Future. Looking back at this movie in ten years, I feel it will be given its place among those greats and regarded as such. It's a cinematic marvel and is one of the greatest movies ever made.",

We can't change the crazy swirling universe/s around us but we can make an impact on the the swirling universes of each person by listening to them, seeing them, treating them with kindness. That is our only hope- no one gets out of here alive.\n\nThe movie seems to take absurd to an extreme at some points but then again, does it really? Think of the absurdity of human construct. We have created a world where we dress up our natural bodies in uncomfortable clothes and spend most of our time alive inside a cubicle until almost the time of our demise for pieces of paper to buy large homes we spent in less time than we do going to the cubicle to buy them. Our existence is scientifically proven to be nothing short of miraculous and this is what we have designed to pass the time of our miraculous existence. We are absurd. Everything is.

The attempted storyline surprises and low budget visual effects caught my heart not because it's the best, but because it's their best from what they can offer. In fact, more than what they could offer. The story is so deep and heartfelt, for me it's not telling just about the mother-daughter relationship but a deeper understanding of a pain felt by people who lost hope in the low point of their life, it's bizarrely speaking to those who had lost their passion in living in any universe (being portrayed so painfully through the antagonist), and the \"O\" bagel (such a humorous element, a bagel as empty as it seem literally made me laugh in the mid of teary scenes) assuming it symbolising the emptiness in all universes is what many people face in this colourful society nowadays. And in the end the story hints about holding the very moment and seeing the beauty in all emptiness, if to be digested well, this story brings so much hope, love, in-depth view of life and some entertaining action scenes and plebeian moments that humble people can relate to. This movie is a masterpiece of bringing the theme of love without even mentioning the word \"love\".",

It starts out incredibly slow with the story of an Asian washeteria owner, her husband, her Americanized daughter, and her wheelchair-bound, disapproving father.  At an IRS audit, her husband switches bodies with his counterpart from another universe where things are a lot more exciting and some unknown force is trying to end all other parallel universes. (SPOILER AHEAD).  He's come to convince the washeteria lady to join the fight and at first, she has no interest or belief in his antics.  Turns out, as part of switching between universes, you have to do something totally random and silly like sticking a foreign object up your backside while whistling The Star Spangled Banner.  That's not in the movie, but it's an example of how silly things can get.  Much of the movie falls back on stereotypical wire-fighting like we've seen in so many previous movies like another Michelle Yeoh vehicle, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  If you like that sort of thing, you'll probably like this movie because it has a lot of it.  (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER).  Turns out the force trying to end all of reality in all universes is the daughter of the washeteria owner and the rest of the movie is Michelle Yeoh's character trying to make up with her daughter and form a bond even though everyone else is telling her that, in order to save reality, she has to kill her daughter in every universe.  And so, that's it.  That's what won the Oscar.  Big disappointment for me and I'm a huge Michelle Yeoh fan.  I was even excited to see Ke Huy Quan again and he did a formidable acting job in this movie.  My biggest disappointment was the story.  Acting was fine from all involved.  While the story was somewhat original, it seems like it's just one of the pack of movies coming out lately (mainly from Marvel) where a multiverse is involved.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, someone is getting mighty flattered today.",

            "content": "Underwhelming. Could've won 4 Oscars (editing, costume, set design, supporting) + 2 nominations (screenplay, direction), but it's only above-average as an overall movie or experience. Not even close to the best movie of 2022 so the record-breaking number of awards is head-scratching. It's extremely derivative (the plot is The Matrix) & there are too many references to other better films throughout as it jumps from 2001 Space Odyssey reference to Matrix reference to 'some other movie' reference.\n\nOverall it's a very silly movie, that gets stuck between two conflicting tones (melodrama & slapstick comedy). Imagine the plot of The Matrix mixed with the tone of Scott Pilgrim. It's jocular tone doesn't match it's disconsolate themes (regret & nihilism). It contains strong components, but might've been better if treated more seriously, dramatically. Allow characters, themes, & actors to create tone so your fun can be earned through story. Instead it's forcefully directed like, \"let's try to make it fun.\" Reminds me of the quote, \"there's a difference between being smart & trying to be smart.\" So on one hand it's a somewhat fun movie, but on the other hand its fun is a contrivance.\n\nWhat worked least for me was: two rocks talking with subtitles, the personification of eternity as an everything bagel & the main character. One of the worst lead characters you'll see: completely cowardly at every turn & a nearly unbearable attempt to create an anti-hero. Thematically it's so heavy handed, it's nearly preachy. What worked best was the first few minutes of act 1 (how it was written, acted, executed). The opening character introductions, pacing & writing are excellent in a complex 'show don't tell' type manner. It quickly devolves into a slapstick time travel romp & lost it's steam once it started 'verse jumping.'\n\nIt's not a bad movie, but it wasn't a great movie like I was expecting from all of the awards and the price to rent. Nicest way I could say it is it wasn't for me. To be fair, that could be due to demographics. If you're under 30, especially female audiences, you may connect with it better. For viewers over 30, especially male audiences who's tastes might typically align with the critic scores more than audience scores, it likely will not reach your expectations & you might even find it growingly frustrating as it continually falls short of those expectations. It's best suited as a mother/daughter bonding movie with some popcorn, but it's not as universal, original, or good as it's score might have you believe.",

            "content": "First review I'm doing on Rotten Tomatoes!\nI want to start of with saying that this movie is one of those movies you have to watch in one sitting and preferably on a big screen. To not have you wait for my honest feedback I'll give it now and then explain why. In all of the movies I have watched, enjoying everything from comedies to action films, sci-fi and dramas, this is absolutely the greatest masterpiece I have ever had the pleasure to watch. If I could, I would love to watch it for the first time again - such an emotional journey it takes one on.\nI have to mention one thing to set your expectations straight: - do not go into this movie aching for a logical, realistic, planned through story to be told- if you do you'll be very disappointed. This is not like any other movie, this is a piece of film - the conglomerations of visuals and sound that produce tension and get the audiences attention. \nBefor watching this movie, I did not know why this movie won so many Oscar's, I was more pessimistic on the overall quality of the movie. The reason why i believe it's one of the greatest film artworks ever is because the absence of rationality and logic, of structured content and foreseeable behaviour allows the creation of feelings and a connection with the overall human emotions portrayed like no other movie has done. Because it does not make sense it feels so close to us. Most of what we experience, what we truly feel does not make sense - we can be angry but still love a person, we can have an abundance of things but still feel empty- unfulfilled. The movie creates so many different scenarios into which we can portray ourselves into, that it connects everybody to the plot ( hell I could not take my eyes off of the screen in the last 30 minutes). This gives everyone this (joy)ride of fast emotions that everyone has - the movie makes you feel happy, sad, disappointed, content, confused, orderly, scared all at the same time. The first half takes getting used to, but if you embrace the confusion, the chaos and watch the second half you'll have the absolute mesmerising experience of a wave of emotions coming over you, being captivated by the pleasure of what it feels like to be alive. Go and watch it!",

I liked how the philosophical questions were posed whimsically instead of in a stereotypical pseudo-intellectual indie film way.\nThe cast's acting was excellent but I don't know if any of them were necessarily Oscar-worthy.

I don't see what's so great about the film. Yes, it is somewhat funny with a heartwarming story that unfolds; however, about 45-60 minutes into it, I was already done. You're not supposed to say the quiet part loud but I'm going to: this won at the Oscars for one reason and one reason only, DEI. It's an average film at best that won due to weak competition or films that were overlooked that should have easily won but were snubbed for Best Picture and Best Director (and yes, I'm talking about THE WHALE and Darren Aronofsky). Within a year this film will be forgotten. Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely happy Laurie Strode won an Oscar (surprised in fact as the buzz heading in was Angela Bassett would win), as well as Ke Huy Quen who will always have a special place in my heart like so many others for Data and Short Round.

First you think that this is intentional, so as to convey the chaotic situation, and once it is established, the pace and tone will settle down. Nope. This is the entire film. \n\nThe film is a nonsensical mish-mash cacophony of frantic, hectic, hyper, non-stop dialog, noise, lights, people, and things. I understand that this is the point, and it's supposed to be Funny & Satirical & Smart & Weird & Sweet & Edgy & Silly & Serious & Meta.\n\nHowever in my opinion it tries way, way too hard, and ultimately falls flat on its face in all its aspirations. At least the title is apt.\n\nSurprise-Surprise, trying to be Everything Everywhere, all at once... doesn't work! At least not for me, as I see that it does for many others. (I will leave the audience cultural psychoanalysis to others \ud83e\udd2a)\n\nThe film is simultaneously sensory overwhelming, and very boring. Dumb, but pretentious at the same time. Both branching & multi-verse hoping, but also repetitive and so very predictable. Quite the accomplishment.\n\nMy quick summary of what I watched:\n\nA high budget student film- bad imitation Woody Allen meets a bad imitation Rick & Morty meets a bad imitation Jackie Chan\n...on coke\n...and LSD\n... and partially in Cantonese\n\nWritten in a parallel universe by Alex Kurtzman and directed by Michael Bay, after they had both been lobotomized with a wooden spoon.\n\nThis actually sounds cooler than it is. Ha! So if this sounds like your cuppa tea, and you are not epileptic (seriously), then... hey go for it. It is certainly an experience! \n\n* Still, I am happy that Short-Round won an Oscar \ud83d\ude09",

The multiverse theory is just a mathematical way to explain the way a universe that favors life could come about randomly and is actually a way to show a way to satisfy the Cosmological Constant and the infinitesimal chance that life could have come about:  Parallel universes containing other versions of ourselves is not a part of the theory.

The single most original, unique, technically advanced perfect example of filmmaking and entertainment that I have witnessed since the early 90s. Plot was very easy to follow along despite what some low ratings say. Like all the films by the masters with names like Martin Scorcese, Sergio Leone, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock, you simply have to pay attention to the screen. I would rank this one right up there with any films the great masters ever made. It's not for the people who love \"Cocaine Bear\" or franchise sequels Like marvel movies. It's made for people who love cinema.  It's a Comedy /sci-fi / action film based around a story of a struggling immigrant family on the verge of divorce and their daughter's nihilist attitudes. If you can watch this movie and not laugh and cry at least once, you need to check your pulse, cause you might be dead. \nIt's easily going somewhere in my top 10 list of favorite films of all time... Right up there with \"2001 a Space Odyssey\", \"Once Upon a Time in New York\",  and \"Goodfellas\"... oh yea...",

Furthermore, it is absolutely blasphemous that Jamie Lee Curtis could win best supporting actress over Angela Bassett. Yes, Jamie Lee Curtis's role was very diverse in Everything Everywhere All At Once, but it certainly did not deserve recognition over Angela bassett's performance and Wakanda Forever. More credit should have been done to the costume and makeup team for Jamie Lee Curtis's character. It was not emotional, it was not groundbreaking, it was not moving, and you would barely know she was in it because it was such an insignificant role as far as impact is concerned. On the other hand, Angela bassett's performance was emotional, it was heartfelt, it was strong, it was passionate, it was memorable, and she was absolutely snubbed. The academy should be ashamed of themselves because this choice seemed more of a racially biased move or political move, I can't put my finger on it but they definitely got that one wrong and missed an opportunity to give a premiere actress her flowers while she's still with us. I noticed that there's been criticism of the movie Wakanda Forever as there are many people in the United States, and across the world, that have a hard time grasping the idea of an elite African nation, on top of the food chain that, couple with the fact that the movie highlights some injustices on behalf of the white man. I get it, but let's take off our blinders and be real. Conversely, EEAAO is receiving positivity biased kudos due to the industry's recent infatuation with Asian inclusivity. And don't get me wrong, the actors in this movie are absolutely phenomenal and this is nothing against them, this is against the academy, this is against the biased critics. Yes, the movie is different and refreshing but that does not make it a better movie than some of its competing films.",

The actors, the fight coreographies, the writing, the make-up, the decorations, the costumes, the secondary actors, the extras, the special effects, the easter eggs showing the shape of a circle referring to the Beagel, in short, I think that this film is quite simply PURE ART.  I have never been so touched by a film like this, I have never been so happy with the film. I think this film defines absolute perfection. Personally, I give it a 10/10, 20/20, 30000/3000!!",

I believe they chose a heroine and a storyline in general which provided a lot of social commentary about modern American life, and the overwhelming nature of our capitalist culture and how it punishes minorities the most.  \n\nUnfortunately, the film seems to lack an articulated or properly-maintained plot at points, and tries to juggle way too many different themes and directions at the same time to be comprehensible.  I was very frustrated by how often the plot took off ramps onto another theme or action scene, without fully developing and explaining what was going on (descriptively or symbolically) in the previous scenes.  I'm guessing this may have something to do with the average American's ever decreasing attention span and critical thinking skills, which seems to have negatively influenced Hollywood film directing over the years.  Regardless of the real reason behind these directing decisions, it made it very difficult to absorb the material at times.\n\nI was also disappointed with the character development of Jobu Tupaki/Joy.  I never felt the audience got sufficient explanation or context behind /why/ she was so suicidal and hostile toward her mother, beyond some superficial information detailing typical parent/ teen child antagonism, or the story of split personalities due to too much multiverse switching.  Someone who is going through complex suffering and struggles to develop into that character deserves a comprehensive backstory and contextual interpretation.  Perhaps some of the explanations for her pain lie in inter-generational conflicts within Chinese American families, in which case that explanation may have been lost in cultural translation.  But I also think aspects of her backstory and character may have also just been poorly written.\n\nAlso, there are far too many kink and BDSM material to make me feel comfortable. Unless these BDSM scenes were poorly-developed attempts at satire, the film seemed to otherwise be promoting a culture that for many people is often one of out-of-control consumerism, exploitation, and abuse.  I get it, adding this material gives the illusion of adding prestige, exoticism, or 'intricacy' to a film.  That's often the effect BDSM references have on general audiences, since that culture is taken at face value as a 'rebellion against normalcy'.  Introducing BDSM themes out of context also has some kind of shock and awe effect, and can be injected in content that may not otherwise be sufficiently thought provoking.  But that's just it, the real value of this material is illusive, and putting motifs of kinky practices in film to substitute more powerful messages or ideas can't fool everyone.  That's not including how gross and disturbing a lot of the kink content was to begin with.",

Did the directors feel the story was too boring and decided they needed to entertain the audience with parlor tricks and a ridiculous marvel like scifi plot? I became so annoyed and frustrated like I was purposely being distracted and denied the actual story. These are the kind of movies I just hate, that make me feel I'm wasting my time in order for the director and actors to seemingly just show off and enjoy themselves.

For me, it's a masterpiece and it quickly became my favourite movie of all time! I don't like the fact that everything nowadays is either a sequel/prequel/remake. It's like people are running out of ideas! But not with this movie - it was the most unique movie I can remember watching. It had everything: humour, sci-fi, action, martial arts and so much raw emotion. The emotion was so strong that I cried one minute and was belly laughing the next. At one point I didn't know if my tears were from laughing or feeling emotional. All thanks to the incredible acting and brilliant script! It must be so difficult for the actors to do comedy acting one minute and then pour so much emotion into the role the next, not to mention all of the action scenes. I appreciate some won't get it, for me and my easily bored ADHD brain it was absolutely perfect! I wonder if the ones that walked out did so when the movie pretended to end! I've watched it three times and could watch it many more. You always see something different the next time you see it. I'm so glad something so unique has won so many awards, and I was rooting for them all during the whole awards season and so happy with the Oscars wins. Although I would say Stephanie Hsu should have got best supporting actress at the Oscar's over Jamie Lee (even though she was excellent too). I hope there's more unique movies like this in the future rather than another remake!!",

At the end of the day it's a glorified \"Mom doesn't understand her family and wants a better life\" movie. The storyline with the husband was good, the acting was amazing, but it was pretty easy to see from the beginning that we were working towards acceptance of the daughter's partner. Also the rock metaphor didn't track cause she lets her fall off the cliff and then  when she's convincing her to stay she falls off the cliff after her? Didn't really make sense. At the end of the day though this movie's composition rings true to its' message: Nothing really matters. Yeah thanks that's what I needed \ud83d\ude02",

Partly it is about nihilism vs love/kindness/connection which for me was another relatable piece.  And partly I was impressed at the overall creativity, acting and humor.  It was not like most films nowadays that are all focused on action or gratuitous violence or predictable tropes.  Yes, the pace was a bit manic at first and took me a bit to fully get where they were heading but I left the theater deeply moved.  I saw it a second time recently, now knowing the plot (and the hype) and it didn't land quite as strongly, but I noticed a lot more fun bits that I missed the first time and I remain impressed at the creativity and basic heart/feeling the film has.",

            "content": "This masterpiece is all about everything happening everywhere, just like the title. And I assure you that you will feel the same way as I do when you watch it. So there will be a question about what is even \"everything\" to start with. Everything is about your life and those people who you are surrounded with. This movie may be fictional by the inclusion of a multiverse but the depiction of underlying philosophical meaning about the realistic view of family issues, life choices, and all the possibilities we could create from small insignificant decisions in our daily lives reflect and wonder about our lives a lot. The whole plot itself takes place in the multiverse which might be something confusing when people who are unfamiliar with the concept hear that but surprisingly it is very simple to comprehend the whole plot. \n\nIt will give you a tremendous amount of different emotions, some of them which you might not have even experienced before. At least, it was that way for me. Many types of comedy also take place in the plot frequently and all of them are fantastic and in perfect timing. Despite having so many funny and ridiculous scenes, the plot itself is very serious to the point everyone can relate to either characters or situations in their lives such as the scenes when the movie depicted the young couple making \"wrong\" choices in this universe, the parenthood focusing on both the perspective of the wife (Evelyn)  and the husband (Waymond), their teenage daughter (Joy)'s problems concerning her life choices being unaccepted by her mother, ruined and shattered hopes from a young couple,  their business situations, the typical dead romance between the long-married couple (especially Asian couples), and many other characters' plots and viewpoints.\n\n\nThere are no villains in this movie. At the first glance, you might probably think (as it is stereotyped) of the mysterious character who seems to have bad intentions toward the universe, Jobu Tupaki (Joy) as the villainess. But if you can truly apprehend the way she becomes who she is, her actions are not justifiable but are understandable. Then, her mother would be the one you would want to blame for making Joy the way she is. But turns out, that is also not the case as everyone always wants the best for themselves or their loved ones. Her mother's action is also understandable but not justifiable. So in short, either her father, her grandfather and his organization, her mother, herself and everyone and every version of them in different universes cannot be blamed as it is going in a circle, and not one person can be blamed for one exact cause. \n\nLast of all, \"Nothing matters\", the main concept of this movie. This line mentioned by Jobu Tupaki(Joy) is a very simple yet powerful line for everyone everywhere it also shows her belief in one of the most famous philosophical branches called Nihilism. She tried to end the whole multiverse and universes by sucking everything into the giant bagel with her superpowers because nothing really matters to her anymore. But the fact that she wanted to end it together with her mother from the far multiverse shows that someone still matters to her and if we think carefully about Joy, she is doing all these things because of the concept of \"nothing matters\" matters to her. And yes it actually feels nice to think that way because if nothing matters, all the pain and guilt we feel from nothing of our lives go away as it is stated by Jobu Tupaki. But on the contrary and concluding from the ending and Evelyn's fighting scene against her daughter to stop her from going into the bagel, we can say that because nothing really matters, it is our choice to decide what and who matters in our daily lives and give and try our best for them no matter whatever the hardship we may face. I think that everyone should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime. You will get an unbelievably amazing experience and feeling in the duration of these 2 hours.",

The tired and hollow storyline really really dragged on me\u2026\n\nI'm going to be blunt: This movie is like a bright speckled donut injected with some super stale bland bread and with a hollow core.\n\nWe get it. It's a story about a mother of a depressed, anxious suicidal young adult, but the treatment is so shallow that if you try to dive in you'll break something. \n\nDaughter: The writers never really get into the daughter and present her as a flapping conundrum for the mother. The writers see fit to laminate a layer of gay in the daughter as if somehow that helps support the daughter's feelings (offensive meter is ticking), but never really delve into the experience of being gay and they never show a moment of gayness in the film, they just slap a label on her, make her hold a girl's hand and the job is done. Instead they focus on presenting the daughter as a writhing ball of whimsical existential angst - and that's it.\n\nOn to the mother: Just a trope of a character. Maternal angst meets bored middle aged woman stuck in a rut. Yay.\n\nTheir relationship: They don't have one. It's just two shallow characters, one pulling away and the other trying to cling on, \"SAVE\" the other from themselves and neither really understanding the other. Hot tip for the writers: without you guys writing these characters as more than a window shop painting, you can't write true connection between them. How do you display human understanding between two characters if there's nothing for the audience to understand either?\n\nThe rest of the movie was shiny and silly. \n\nThe shine: The shine was pretty. Lots of pretty things. They were shiny. They were well done. I liked them! But you can't watch 2:20 of shiny things alone\u2026 well I cant. Gummies aren't legal where I live.\n\nThe silly: The kind of silly people who wear Depends appreciate, but for everyone else it's like trying to share a meal with the same person after they've taken their evening Xanax.\n\nI have no idea how this movie won so many awards outside of the visuals.\n\n2/5",

Sir Laurence Olivier couldn't have made that script sing. Or even hum. And the cornball 'feel good' bailout in the last ten minutes to give the film some heart? Yuck. I realize we're not supposed to mention the proverbial elephant in the room, but if this film hadn't been made by a largely Asian cast and crew, in a time period when 'inclusion' seems more important to the Academy than quality, EEA probably wouldn't have been nominated, let alone be a big time winner. I was hoping this might be 'Irish Year', since Banshees was a pretty good flick, but I guess we'll have to wait 'til next year...",

I found myself rolling my eyes A LOT.   Buried under a lot of ludicrous crap is a beautiful message, which is why I gave it two stars.  Too bad the message was obscured by so much ridiculousness. \n\nI really wanted to love this movie after watching the Oscars last night.  However, it was a painful watch, and I had to force myself to finish it.  If it had not won best picture, I don't think I would have lasted past the first 15 minutes, which is saying something.  I pretty much always finish what I start.    That said, I'm not sorry I watched it.  At least I'll have some context.  Overall, I am just left sad for all of the other worthy nominees passed over for this overwrought mess.",

This credits the co-directors, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (\"the Daniels\"), winning the academy award for best screenplay and best director. The film was nominated for 11 oscars going into the ceremony and came out with 7 of them, including best actress in a leading role (Michelle Yeah), best actress in a supporting role (Jamie Lee Curtis), best actor in supporting role (Ke Huy Quan), directing (The Daniels) and best picture. \n\nThe movie does drag on in parts, especially the climax.
