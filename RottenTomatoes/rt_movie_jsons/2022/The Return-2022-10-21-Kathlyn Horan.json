    "summary": "Trailblazing, hell-raising country music legend Tanya Tucker defied the standards of how a woman in country music was supposed to behave. Decades after Tanya slipped from the spotlight, rising Americana music star Brandi Carlile takes it upon herself to write an entire album for her hero based on Tanya's extraordinary life, spurring the greatest comeback in country music history. THE RETURN OF TANYA TUCKER follows Tanya's richly creative, utterly captivating, bumpy ride back to the top as Brandi encourages her to push past her fears to create a new sound and reach a new audience. The writing, the experimenting, and refining of this new music mixes with all that came before -- using rare archival footage and photographs to delve into Tanya's history, beginning in a single wide trailer in Seminole, Texas. Taking stock of the past while remaining vitally alive in the present and keeping an eye on the future, THE RETURN OF TANYA TUCKER is a rousing exploration of an unexpected friendship built on the joy of a perfectly timed creative collaboration.",

            "content": "The problem with this movie isn't Tanya Tucker. She is fabulous. It's the annoyingly self righteous Brandi Carlile. At one point she states that Miranda Lambert wrote \u2018The House that Built Me.' Absolutely false. You have to wonder if no one screened this thing. Tanya Tucker is an icon. A legend. Carlile is an opportunist. Who this far has attached her name to a movie in order to move ahead. The fact her wife produced this thing drives that point home further. I hope people can look past this to appreciate the brilliance that has always been Tucker. She's worthy of this movie. Sadly, tacking on someone attempting to be relevant costs this movie quite a bit. Tucker deserved better than this.",

This documentary brought back all the love I had for her and her music but it also brought admiration and pride for her! Thank you Brandi Carlile Carlile for getting  Tanya back on stage. I would love to see it again!",
