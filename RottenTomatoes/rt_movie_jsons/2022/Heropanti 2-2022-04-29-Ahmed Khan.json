    "summary": "Babloo (Tiger Shroff) is a computer genius and Inaaya (Tara Sutaria) is a self-made billionaire. The two fall in love but due to unforeseen circumstances they suddenly part ways. When they are reunited, action, drama, and edge-of-the-seat thrills follow as the world wants Babloo dead. Laila (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is the man behind all the cybercrimes in the world and how Babloo confronts Laila with flying cars, and high-octane action forms the story of this action-packed, sizzling romantic movie.",

            "content": "The negative reviews this movie has are 100% warranted. A plot that makes barely any sense. As if it was one long flashback with no joke or connection to anything currently happening. Action sets which basically feel like your being taken to a different location every 5 seconds, and with side characters that lack any sense of motive or coherency.  \nBut throughout it i found myself enthralled on how insane this movie could get at any given second. The action scenes hardly had a consistent camera, but there are moments left me utterly speechless. An amazing villain who stole the show with their level of insanity that could only exist in such a movie. Dance moves that are basically emotes from any battle royal . Shout out the random Bagpipe squad in the Zombie scene. A main protagonist that is John Wick,  Mr.Hacker man, Clark Kent, and the flash in one person.  THE BEST FENCE IN ANY MOVIE EVER!!! +Britten. \n If you got the time for a 2 and a half hour long movie this is probably the most movie a person could ever watch. \nBest regards Ziziziziziziziziz",

No great songs, old dated dance stages there's so many loops I don't know how to comprehend them in words. Vfx is a complete disaster it felt like that someone who recently finished his course done it. The cinematic experience was unbearable because it doesn't seems like one it's more felt like that someone a shot a whole movie on a phone.",
