The fact that this movie is the biggest box office success in history is a galling indictment of western civilization. This is nothing more than a mediocre kid's movie with an insane CGI budget.",

This thing goes on for 3 effen hours.  You could lop off 1 & a half and although you still would get a worn-out, seen-it-all-before plot and terrible dialog, you wouldn't  waste 3 hours of your life.   \n\nIf you could see it in 3D and in a theatre that was presenting it in Dolby Atmos sound, then I would say, go for the spectacle and beautify of the cinematography and the lushes surround sound of the score -- like in an IMAX 3D theatre where I saw it, but even then, it might be better to go while you are microdosing so your mind is already numb.  Other than that -- go get the BluRay and watch the first one instead even if you saw it already -- it's 10 years old and you will find that much more rewarding.",

Meaning you can watch Avatar 2 without watching part 1 because everything that happened it part 1 didn't matter. THis movie is all about just showing off VFX graphics which in all honesty was worse than the first movie. not by much, but still come on Graphics are supposed to get better with time. not regress .",

A movie that is as void of any new ideas or creativity should have been ridiculed by everyone and should have flopped. But man... I guess people just love their CGI over literally every other aspect of a movie buy a HUGE margin. \n\nAlso, I really enjoy some cartoons.

My only complaint is that at times, scenes looked like they were from a video game. While this did affect my viewing experience slightly, it was rare and far between. The story, while incredibly simple to follow, did a fantastic job at picking up where the first one left off and did a great job at setting up the \"potential\" next 3 films. This is mostly due to the introduction of the water Na'vi clans as well as the phenomenal acting done by the new and old characters alike. The introduction of several new creatures is also really cool. This is one to see on the biggest screen possible and in 3D or 4D. It makes the film look so much more stunning than a normal theater screen. While it's not the best film of the year, it is the most beautiful looking and well-made.",

This is not the case in the sequel which spends a lot of dull moments familiarizing us with life in the water.\nThat being said, Avatar : The Way of Water is visually stunning. It has a strong script, when building the story or executing action scenes. But the script lags during those long dull moments. It benefits from a strong cast capable of making this sci-fi environment and the story believable.\nVisuals are stunning and the CGI is incredible. The diverse alien creatures are easy to accept.

The ending is known two weeks before movie's premiere, no surprises. If the plan is to have sequence after sequel, why don't you sacrifice some of the good characters to make it more articulate?

They make you feel guilty even when they are digital creatures, not to mention destroying digital nature (digital tears are welcome). I can't wait for the next two movies. Really. I mean, i will not wait! Like a did for this one. Counting the days to the release, not next time.

            "content": "In my personal opinion, Avatar 2 did not meet my expectations. While the film had stunning visuals and special effects, I found it to be lacking in terms of plot and character development. The storyline felt predictable and lacking in depth, failing to engage me as a viewer. The characters themselves felt one-dimensional and underdeveloped, making it difficult to form any emotional connections with them.\n\nIn terms of pacing, I felt that the film was inconsistent. Some parts felt rushed while others dragged on, making it difficult to maintain interest throughout the 3-hour runtime. Additionally, the themes explored in the film, such as environmentalism and corporate greed, felt clichéd and unoriginal, lacking any real depth or insight.\n\nMy 5 main reasons:\n\n\nThe Storyline: The author argues that the plot of the film is predictable and lacks depth, making it unengaging and unmemorable.\n\nThe Characters: The author believes that the characters in the film lack development and depth, making it difficult for audiences to connect with or care about them.\n\nThe Visuals: Despite the impressive special effects, the author believes that the film relies too heavily on visual spectacle, sacrificing storytelling and character development in the process.\n\nThe Themes: The author argues that the themes explored in the film, such as environmentalism and the dangers of corporate greed, are clichéd and unoriginal, lacking any real depth or insight.\n\nThe Pacing: The author feels that the film is poorly paced, with the story feeling rushed in some areas and dragging in others, making it difficult to stay engaged throughout.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with Avatar 2 and believe that it could have been improved with more focus on character development and a stronger, more engaging plot. While the film may have appeal for some viewers, it did not resonate with me personally and left me feeling unsatisfied.",

Even any aspiring writer had written it then it would never have gotten read by an agent let alone produced into a movie. It really annoys me that such an important oversight is forgotten and instead replaced by an egotistical director making a vanity project without anyone willing to question the quality of the script.

Which are secretly being sent to Earth.\n\n5 the friendly scientists tell to the new scientists the story of the previous film and how Jake was transported from the human body to the avatar in a definitive and mystical way.\n\n6 The new scientists then ask their old ones and friends to convince jake to take tests so they can understand how this was possible that science exists behind eyaua's magic. And if this could be the way to heal the earth.\n\n7 jake goes to do tests and at the same time they discover that the substance of the whales' brain could be the energy conductor that could transfer large amounts of data without burning the receiver's brain. And they are excited to use this energy conduit to finally create eternal life for wealthy humans. Because they could manufacture bodies of avatars at the cost of billions and when the person is going to die they could buy a body and transport the mind to the avatar. But before finishing the genetic mapping Jake stops the scans and leaves.\n\n\n8 by secretly reporting the discoveries to Earth, the executives there then see the potential for profits and decide to send a special group of their armies to kidnap jake to finish the genetic mapping of the research and hunt the planet's whales for the new substance. Look what a beautiful justification for everything.\n\n9 With terrorism affecting everyday life in the village of the forest and fearing the kidnapping of one of his children, Jake decides to run away and hide in the water town.\n\n10 and from there, just take the current film and just reassemble it following this premise and, in my opinion, it would justify everything we saw in the film and it would still be possible to cut a good part and stay at 2 hours and 20.\n\n11 Just cut all that part of the new invasion and the use of the same previous villain that magicaly return again plese forgot this.\n\nVillains could be navis radical members who don't accept jake as an equal and these are the ones trying to get rid of him and take over pandora with weapons provided by humans to unbalance the fight.\n\nWhat do you think?",

            "content": "Patriarchal Stories and Matriarchal Worship, Cameron's Self\nContradictions and Divisions\n\nIn his obsession with nature, Cameron glimpses the matriarchal attributes of nature and the plundering of nature by humans, which is one of the central themes of his films.\n\nHe used many symbols to build the visual world of Avatar, such as the sky people spaceship that resembles male genitalia and the countless caves and circular designs of the Avatar world to symbolize matriarchal nature.\n\nBut the two themes expressed in his films are self-contradictory and contradictory.\n\nPerhaps it is his gender privilege that prevents him from confronting the fact that in a patriarchal society, men plunder women's wombs through the institution of marriage, just as sky people loot the wombs of natural mothers through technology, both of which are the same.\n\nSo Jake Sully, the father in his film, seems out of place in the whole matriarchal nature created by Cameron.\n\nWhile Jake, the father, is in the primary position, holding the baby in his hands, his wife Neytiri, who has just given birth, is submissively in the secondary role; the ritual is the worship of the fertility of the goddess \"mother Eva,\" this scene is an important image that contradicts the main idea of Cameron's film.\n\nOr rather, the ancient goddess again comes to man's dream world through symbols. Still, she can only exist in a nebulous dream world, either as a symbol of the goddess mother Eva, a dead female scientist, or a non-human animal Tulkun, the man once again found the goddess of nature who rules life and death. Still, he can not link her to the enslaved wife and daughter.\n\nPerhaps Cameron perceives his self-contradiction, or the fear caused by the contradiction between the two, anxiety brought about by the separation of the two powers of the female characters ruling fertility and death, so that the woman heading life away from violence (the power of death), and the woman leading violence away from fertility, can be very clearly perceived, where the female characters, all must choose, it is evident that the fertility goddesses The female characters who decide the power of death, the commander-in-chief of the Sky People Command, and the occasional woman who doesn't know her name (although these goddesses of death are suspected of deliberately good European and American feminism to make up the numbers).\n\nOf course, Cameron also thought of a way to solve the relationship between the mother and violence, the mother is the archer, but she stays away from violence most of the time; she is forbidden to initiate violence for herself, but she still plays the meek wife in daily life, taking care of the man, as well as cooking for the man, bandaging, so the mother is usually away from the violence of the Virgin, only in exceptional circumstances are allowed to use violence, that is, the son and husband Threatened. The advancement of the feminist movement allowed women to be empowered, but only if that empowerment was only for the allegiance of the patriarchal family.\n\nWhy? Because once the mother is free to use violence like the father, the father's position of absolute power is threatened, and the father's legitimate existence is inevitably questioned. In Cameron's film, the father's power comes only from death, and he must infinitely magnify the power of men's death to retain the legitimacy of men in power.\n\nWhen the ancient goddess reappears, she is the warmth of new life and brutal death. For a baby, to be looked at and loved by its mother is life, and to be ignored and neglected by its mother is dead, which is the first power structure experienced by human beings.\n\nNo matter how Cameron sings the praises of the patriarchal family, this is also a time when the patriarchal family is disintegrating, and the patriarchal family under the marriage system is gradually deteriorating.\n\nIn the matriarchal family and the patriarchal family, the empowerment of the man in the family cannot be accomplished without the woman joining the marriage. The confrontation between matriarchal and patriarchal power is also between these two kinds of families, that is, between mothers and wives.\n\nA wife is not a mother; a mother does not become a wife; it is a two-choice problem for women, a wife who surrogates children for her husband and a mother who chooses genes for her children.\n\nNatural mothers are brutal and cold, do not create offspring for any male, and look coldly at the male competition, the weak die, and the strong win, mothers always choose the winner, even if they choose the same winner, but it does not mean that the mother will become a wife, the winner is always changing, and the mother's choice is constantly changing.\n\nThe people who enslave their mothers will be enslaved; totalitarianism is birthed in patriarchy, this is the punishment of man for turning mothers into wives, but it is not the only punishment, nor is it the heaviest.\n\nHumans have already lost their mothers, so every child has a lifelong lack of so-called sweet drama in the male lead, unconditional love, and attention to the heroine of the male information to provide shelter and security for women. Are they the real man? In nature, only the mother is unconditional love and shelter existence humans look for love as children look for their mothers.\n\nThe role of the father in the patriarchal family is to imitate the missing mother, but it is not like men to be mothers; sexuality is the final point of their reproduction; they are born unable to link with their babies, they are frightened, widowed, frequent cheaters, rely on authority to maintain legitimacy (like the awkward father in Avatar), but they are also missing mothers, people look to their wives, to their husbands, even People look to their wives, to their husbands, and even to their children and those in power for motherly love. Still, the traces of mothers have long disappeared into history, and love has become control, kidnapping, and deprivation.\n\nFor too long, humanity has been without mothers, and wives who are disappointed in their husbands are even raising their children as their mothers, demanding attention, motherhood, and shelter from them.\n\nWe all hope that Eva, the mother goddess, will return to earth, she is as we imagine, powerful, warm, cruel, breeding life, but she also brings death, although at this time she is still far away, all the children lacking a mother are longing for her.\n\nUntil then, humans can only become their mothers.",

But, have seen better. It was also a really great story.\n\nThe only thing that keeps it from being a 5 is that the human boy made no sense.\nNever explained why he was there, or how they ended up with him.\n\nThe only thing I could figure is that they needed an inside guy to cover various plots in the movie. So, that was kind of distracting from the story a bit.\n\nAlso it was not as good as the first Avatar. But, the effects and the genius work put into the film is pretty amazing.

            "content": "it was a long breath hold, but Cameron finally made it. he gave us a complete, comprehensive (at most times) and an overall pretty satisfying experience at the cinema once again only to leave us wanting for more.\n\nthis film is in every way better than the first. the story has heart, the battles pack an emotional punch, the visuals want you to pack your bags and leave for pandora, and most of the events happen naturally throughout the course of the film. I think cameron actually listened to some of the criticism which has been going throughout the years for the first avatar movie and actually tried to tell a better and more engaging story whilst providing us with a technical achievement.\n\nfirst of all, talking about the visual effects and the cinematography (which are the film's core strengths), it's just mind-boggling. I haven't got the slightest idea how they managed to achieve the shots they have on-screen. each and every frame of this film can be a wallpaper and no one would complaint. cinematographer Russell Carpenter really manages to keep your eyes glued to the screen with his abilities. despite most of the actors being the Na'vi this time, you can't tell that they are not real. each and every Na'vi looks insane and meticulously detailed which helps us to differentiate the focus characters when a large no. of them are present in frame. the vfx team deserve all the respect for this.\n\nnow, talking about the performances, they're all spot on and not a single loose thread can be seen. Worthington as Jake Sully/Toruk Makto might be a problematic father but everything gets all right in the end when he shares a moment with his son Lo'ak which was probably one of the best emotional moments from the film. Zoe Saldaña, whose character Neytiri takes a backseat in the overall film does more than required in the scenes she's in and proves to us that she is an important and irreplaceable character in the entire series. Stephen Lang being given a much better role this time around manages to be a worthy antagonist for the Na'vi and has a much more personal involvement in his battle against the Sully's. loved to hate him in the film. the standouts for me particularly were Sigourney Weaver as Kiri and Britain Dalton as Lo'ak who get to do the most in the film and press most of the emotional buttons.\n\nanother thing which I liked and disliked at the same time was the frame rate. the film for most of it's runtime runs at a dazzling 48 frames per second but for some reason cuts to the standard 24 frames per second in between shots. this was really distracting and at times took me out of the scene. i think cameron struggled to maintain the frame rates of the shots and should've gone with either of the two instead of keeping them both.\n\nnow, talking about the story, it's better than the first alright but still doesn't quite get interesting where it could match the amount of technical marvel which was being displayed on screen. Cameron does write a better story than the first but at the beginning, it sure does feel like the film is a sequel, just for the sake of being a sequel when the sky people go and return within 5 minutes of the runtime whereas in reality, it has been decades since they first left. that just feels lazy and cinematic liberty taken too far. the emotional weight is much more significant than the first and the final battle feels like an emotional ride, although I would need more than this predictable story to step in the theatres for the next film as I was able to tell each and every single thing that was going to happen next right from the moment things start to happen.\n\noverall, I'd say do not miss this in the theatres even if the story is weak because it's better than the first presented to you on a plate of visually dazzling shots with some great performances.",

Es una película bastante disfrutable y demuestra que Avatar tiene mucho más que ofrecer. Puede que en los últimos momentos de película no se sienta tan épica como la anterior, pero es una buena secuela que comienza a extender este universo creado por James Cameron que sin duda está destinado a convertirse en una de sus mejores creaciones.

But let's cut the crap. Bad News first, as always.\n\nThe movie tries too hard to emotionally connect to the audience through scenes where family bonding in prominent. Like, way to hard. Sure, it got the reactions of sorrow for sure, and it definitely calls for being an emotional movie because of this, but it causes other things to be ignored or pushed aside. There was no clash or fight for screen time. Most of this movies screen time was family moments, and that wouldn't be bad if this wasn't an action movie.\n\nThe family moments or the scenes trying to introduce you to all these new concepts are dragged on and makes a very exponential climax that just kind of appeared like a a final boss, not built up to over time, and it doesn't feel right. It feels like a very forced climax. There were a lot of ideas just shoved into a feature length film. They don't want to have to make a sequel to the sequel, so they rushed this into a smaller time frame than the plot could handle.\n\nAnother thing is certain scenes have a lot of animation inconsistencies. It doesn't seem to appear to be able to decide on a specific FPS rate, and it really messes with your eyes, especially on the big screen. \n\nIt's good enough to watch, as the elements of action were amazing to watch and very engaging. It introduces new characters that are easy to root for and care for, and have complex stories of their own to tell. This movie has other good things, but over all, this movie is just above average. That's all I can say about it.",

            "content": "Avatar: The Way of Water represents a positive trend, alongside recent titans such as Top Gun: Maverick and (to an extent) Elvis, back to the old-school thinking of making a blockbuster. Of course, this is unsurprising with James Cameron creating some of the biggest spectacles Hollywood has churned out and with the first Top Gun being as old-school blockbuster as it gets. However, with Marvel and superhero films hegemonising the modern blockbuster-scape and with little room for any competition to adequately shine, it is surprising the sequel to a 13-year old film managed to be the commercial and critical success it has. Avatar reminds Hollywood a blockbuster should not be a lineage of successive films akin to a game of trivia, but ought to be an experience which justifies the price of a cinema ticket.\n\nThe Avatar sequel has managed to rekindle interest among cinemagoers for huge CGI spectacles with blockbusters being oversaturated with dodgy 'hit-and-miss' visual effects, by pushing the boundaries (once again) of what is possible. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this film is not its revolutionary use of computer technology to render an alien world without looking overtly fake, or stressing the eyes of the viewer to the point of irritation, but to do so without alienating its audience and creating it believably with a sense of  familiarity. A world crafted so intricately and with so much personal dedication from its director, visual effects teams and concept artists, that it is difficult to overstate the sense of artistry and personality in the film. \n\nComplimenting the visuals, the score expertly composed by Simon Franglen (as a replacement of the late James Horner) is fundamental to the creation of a world of such beauty and virility, and the immersion within the depths of the rich ocean or intimidating landscapes of the forest. Franglen builds off Horner's magic with an equally rich score which helps convey the enormity of Pandora, and is reflective of the enchanting setting. \n\nThe Way of Water does indeed have its weaknesses, as any film does and ought to strive to, as to create a piece of art is to make mistakes. The inconsistent frame rate contradicts the verisimilitude of the world and its characters, and would otherwise be better left without bar some isolated sequences. Further, James Cameron has always been spotty with dialogue, and Avatar: The Way of Water is no exception in some sequences, with ill-thought writing choices holding back some otherwise exceptional and dramatic sequences - as well as its characters. Further, the narrative is indeed somewhat derivative and hardly stands out as the most original screenplay - just as with most blockbusters - however, it does not distract from the films subtext and key messages, nor does it from the world it creates. \n\nAs with much of Cameron's other projects, the subtext is clear - the environment and its creatures are important and ought not be destroyed for profit, and the mistreatment of indigenous people is a stain on human connection. Of course, this acts as a sufficient and poignant socio-cultural criticism, offering an interesting enough narrative. With most modern-blockbusters serving only the commercial interests of studios at the expense the auteurship and creativity, Avatar stands out as an example of a film which can do both when a studio vests power and trust in an individual willing to push the boundaries of today's cinema. \n\nAlthough the film certainly is not perfect, it is representative of a positive trend, which studios will hopefully follow which could see a total overhaul of the modern blockbuster akin to those of yesteryear.",

            "content": "Visually it was SUPER impressive, especially in 3D, but overall I'm disappointed that it was pretty much the same story as the first one. The sky people hadn't learnt anything from their first visit. I was expecting an evolution in the story. I was hoping they had been humbled and became curious to understand how the Avatars connect with the nature spirits, and maybe they could have had a transformation of sorts themselves.\n\nEven back in the day of founding white Australia the colonisers were aware of the mess they had made in America and other places and were at least trying to do it slightly better. (spolier: they didn't, but that's another story). In this movie the sky people are one-dimensional nasty killers at any cost (all those massive resources on another planet to catch one person was a weak plot line in itself). \n\nIt could have told a really important story for our times about the pursuit of working with difference in cultures and seeking mutually beneficial outcomes. eg. It could have been really nuanced with some of the sky people \"getting it\" and some of them stuck in the old dominator military ways. It would set up an epic heroic journey about creating civilisation amongst differing cultures - giving us hints about how we can now change our trajectory away from glorifying technology and military, and towards a meaningful and subtle connection to nature and divinity - whilst also bringing differing world views and cultures together. It's a story we really need to hear right now with all the polarisation that is going on in the world.\n\nInstead it was mostly glorifying military, giving people lots of visceral ideas about how to combine AI with military - super scary as they make it look so powerful, agile and sexy. The action sequences were classic juvenile testosterone Hollywood - completely over the top.\n\nNot only were the sky people not moved by the magic of the Navi's, they were downright angry about it - trying to kill the one person who had built a bridge between the two cultures. This is the worst-case scenario story that could have been told for Avatar 2.\n\nIt was all about revenge. Plus lots of old-school masculine loyalty tropes in there that feel quite dated in the 2020s. And the fact that they saved the villain to fight another day is so 🤮. It suggests that the next movie is going to be more of the same.\n\nOn a positive note the magical forest and underwater scenes were the highlight - so glorious, connecting and inspiring. This will inspire the nature-loving folk. But the high tech AI weaponry will likely arouse the non-thinking, gun-toting, right wing macho crowd who are all about defending their patch. It makes high tech military look exciting, sexy and inevitable. It normalises a dystopian future (like so many other hollywood movies do).\n\nPerhaps the making of this movie is a mirror of our times - it got so distracted in it's own high technology that it totally missed the substance of the story telling.",

The environments, the underwater shots are groundbreaking, sometimes that won't be topped anytime soon. As for the rest of the film though in terms of story and characters, it seriously lacks. When I wasn't focused on the beautiful world I was quite uninvested with how Cameron executed the story. It was basically the same as the first time around only it's the bad guy who gets most of the screen time played effectively by Stephen Lang.

            "content": "If you can believe it, Avatar: The Way of Water, the movie a decade in the making, tops the visual masterpiece of the original, Avatar. Be warned that this movie is a commitment as it is over three hours long! \n \nJake Sully (Sam Worthington), the human transformed into a Na'vi person, and his wife Ney'tiri (Zoe Saldaña) are back and now have four kids. With the unexpected return of the wicked Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who is brought back as a Na'vi impersonator along with his crew, the Sully's are forced to flee the forest and explore what other places on Pandora, their home planet, have to offer. \n \nSince this is the sequel to the mega-hit film, Avatar, I recommend watching the first film before viewing this one, as there are many important references and details that are key to following this film. The storyline leaves us with some more questions than answers; however it sets up moviegoers for the next installments. Viewing it on a big screen, especially in 3D – which I recommend – makes you feel like you're right beside the characters in the world of Pandora. Speaking of Pandora, the world building is absolutely remarkable. It expands our view of this amazing foreign planet. And as the name suggests, it focuses on the islands, oceans and reefs of Pandora. The aquatic plants and animals are majestic and gorgeously iridescent. The reefs and oceans are eye popping and staggering. Everything is so glowy and vivacious. If you thought the animation of the original film was awe-inspiring, wait until you watch this one! The animation is hyper-realistic. When looking closely, you can see the ultra-detailed textures of the characters and settings. The movement almost looks like it is from a cut scene of a video-game (it's honestly the best way I can describe it). Stephen Lang's performance as the Colonel is so powerful, and makes you hate his guts even more than you did in the first film. Sam Worthington as Jake and Zoe Saldaña as Ney'tiri seem to have developed even better chemistry than in the first movie.\n \nThe message of this movie is to always fight to protect loved ones. This movie also has strong messages about the bonds with family and friends. Be forewarned that there is violence and violence involving animals. \n \nI give Avatar: The Way of Water 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This movie releases in theaters on December 16, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!",

Overall the story is pretty thin, even for a \"kid's movie\". (that goes forever).\n\nPut it this way, James Cameron: you are bland. Your vibe is bland and it's not going to change. The only way to really make A2:WOW really work would be to have a GREAT opening scene, with thriller elements and an intense action sequences unfolding, without pointless excess or emotionless sentiment. Cameron, either because of his ego or simply because Titanic \"made a lot of money\" doesn't get this idea of carved-to-it's-essence story economy anymore. The film feels dilute and thin as a dramatic work and has, occasionally, very pleasing and carefully rendered computer graphics animations. As usual, people are raising complaints about the lack of natural frame blending we associate with 25 fps, and \"super-high-whizz\" 60 fps. \n\nTo be honest, audience backlash against this film is everywhere, so it may shade your view of what is, basically, a solid action/adventure film - it's almost like a b-movie where the characters aren't real and the plot is underdeveloped but it goes boom crash bang (splash).",

Yes, it is very long, but it would be a shame not to meander through some of the most breathtaking CGI made to date.  If you are going to go big, then go crazy big.  This movie (somewhat like its predecessor) needs to be seen on the biggest screen to get the full experience.  Is the plot a bit rehashed? Yes, but there is just enough new stuff that it clears the originality bar (even if just by a little bit).  Perfect? No, but you can see the money spent on the screen and you can have a good time if you invest the attention span.",
