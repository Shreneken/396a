I guarantee it.  This action-packed high octane film, rocks!\nAnd, if you don't agree to its hyper intensity, with special clashing twists and turns, you most certainly will upon the 'AlCOHOLIA' celebration!\n  When going to see this film\nbe sure your mind is sharp and alert, for all the intracacies that you will be exposed to.\n  The idea of 'Circles,' as presented in the movie 'Dark City,' (1998), will be further clarified in this action-packed thriller.  And, flavors of Ben Afflect's 'Accountant,' John Travota, and Nicolas Cage's, 'Face Off,' and, Russell Crow's 'L.A. Confidential,' will also be well noticed, where choices, punishment, corruption, and, just a simple one-on-one, and, varying phylosophies of rationalzation, motives and riddles, intervene.\n  And, let me run this by you, and see if you might not agree, upon an old Japanese saying, 'Life is an Illusion.'\n  This film is very well acted by all who participated in it.  I give it easily five stars.  My only pieve, was, it was awfully loud.  But, this may have been the fault of the projectionist.  I didn't want to miss the first part of this film, as I've complained up-front before about these things, so, I just jammed my ears with kleenex, in hopes that that, would curtail the concussive blows of the fuller force - if you know what I mean.  But, I must say it did enhance the special effects, when the base notes, and, emphasis, came into play.\n  I plan to soon watch, and, willingly pay the extra ticket price to see this in IMAX.  Be prepared for a doozy of an all-out war between rivals who clearly believe their reasons should be validly pursued.  \n                   Would you like to . . . ?\n                                    \n                                   by Doug Obujen",

The dance sequence in the movie came from out of nowhere, and didnt have anything to do with the plot, but it was still in entertaining Dan sequence. A cartoon at the beginning of the movie sets up the premise which it doesnt quite pay off, The premise of a trickster storyteller. But overall it was very enjoyable",
