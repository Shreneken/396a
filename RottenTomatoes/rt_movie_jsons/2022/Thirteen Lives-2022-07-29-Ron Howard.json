Veteran director Ron Howard always makes film that are both well made and also very watchable. His latest is no exception. Based on the huge news story of 2018 this film tells the story straight forwardly and honestly and that makes it work. The story was the Thai Cave mining rescue operation. 13 people, 12 teenage boys and their soccer coach, went into remote caves in Northern Thailand but become stranded when immense rain floods the caves. They survive initally for 10 days before anyone can even sight them in the caves. Then a rescue mission is mounted, primarliy by two English divers, to get them out. This is a film about not just survival but also ingenuity and perseverance. Even though we know the outcome there are plenty of jaw dropping moments leading to a very emotional outcome. Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell are well cast as the taciturn divers. A film I think most people would gain from watching it.",

            "content": "The true tale of rescuing the trapped 13 Thai boys in the summer of 2018 is turned into an engrossing and often thrilling if overly long 2022 movie experience thanks to director Ron Howard and a dedicated crew bringing to vivid life the harrowing drama. I was vaguely aware of this story as it played out originally, though missed the critically acclaimed documentary The Rescue from last year that covered the same material, but watching the movie I realize I knew very little of the actual horror. The movie centers around a pair of English divers (Colin Farrell, Viggo Mortensen), both with over 30 years of specific cave diving experience, helping the Thai Navy Seals and government officials to find and save the missing children and their coach. The submerged path is one that lasts about seven hours, and it's narrow, dark, and treacherous, easy to lose your way. when you only have a tank of air, navigation is the difference between life and death. It's also a race against time as the monsoon waters are flooding the cave further. The cave traversal sequences are nerve-wracking and deeply immersive, enough so that even I, while watching, started sitting on the edge of my couch in the safety of my own home. The story isn't entirely centered on our two heroic white guys, as the screenplay by William Nicholson (Gladiator) widens the focus onto many who contributed to the boys eventual rescue, from an engineer who realized they needed to dam water drainage at the top of a mountain, to the locals who agreed to have their crops flooded for the possibility of saving the kids, to the bravery of the Thai Seals, to the hope and burdens of the parents. I never knew the boys had to literally be anesthetized to be removed, and the ensuring climax as the rescue team keeps tabs on how their precious cargo is responding during the multi-hour journey underwater. Howard keeps things pretty straightforward and helpfully provides onscreen graphics to better provide a sense of distance within the cave, which just makes the heroics even more dizzying. Thirteen Lives is an inspiring story about the world coming together for common cause (except Elon Musk, who baselessly accused one of the divers as being a \"pedo\") and it's also genuinely exciting even when you know they all make it out alive, which is its own credit. It might have used some tightening up for pacing, but it's a well-made dramatization that pays real homage to the many heroes without overplaying its drama.\n\nNate's Grade: B+",

So first of all, this movie needs to get some technical academy award nominations, at least for sound, incredible work. The VFX in this movie are invisible, the cinematography is pretty good, the production design is incredible and the camerawork is fantastic. I thought Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell did an incredible job as the cave divers, as well as the rest of the cast, it really didnt feel like a movie, more like a documentary of the rescue mission. The movie really tries to respect the divers, family and everyone else involved in the rescue of the football time and sometimes that hurts the characters and the dialog a bit, but for this situation i can understand it. Overall an impactfull technical movie, with of course an story which will forever be incredible.",

I saw the fear and misgivings in each actors' eyes and their emotions flowed into mine. The real life Stanton, Harris, Jewell, Volanthen, and Mallinson were the world's best cave divers but never had they had to consider, and ultimately carry out this unprecedented rescue. Ron Howard did another wonderful job in putting the viewer into the eyes of the divers, the souls of the parents, the hearts of the people of Thailand, and the wherewithal of the many, many volunteers who came to help, whether it was cooking, making pipe with bamboo poles, damming holes, or just watching their crops and livelihood literally wash away in order to save these children.",

            "content": "Ron Howard has been churning out excellent films that have been a favourite with audiences, movies like Splash, Cocoon, Willow, Parenthood, Backdraft, Apollo 13, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, A Beautiful Mind, The Da Vinci Code, Frost/Nixon, Rush, In the Heart of the Sea. Hollywood has never much cared for him. He's had just one nomination as director for Frost/Nixon. I think this is because you don't watch a Ron Howard movie and think \"Ah, this is clearly a Ron Howard movie\". He's just quietly professional. He doesn't leave his own mark on the way the story is told. He tells the story the way he feels it should be told, which is different each time. I wish more directors were like Ron Howard. Just professional. Far too many directors are trying to be the next bit thing, the next Scorsese, Coppola, and failing. There's much to be said for just doing a great job.\n\nIn this film Ron Howard tells the story as a straight docu-drama. There is a bit of the old \"shaky-cam\" going on which by now everybody detests, but it seems to  fade into the background over time. This is a big, big story and with 10,000 people involved there are far too many people with stories to tell in a movie that is 2 and a half hours long. Consequently the action tends to focus on the British and Australian divers, who with expertise gained from similar rescues were able to pull off a seemingly impossible task of raising these boys from the depths of the mountain through 3 hours of crawling through underground tubes of rock filled with water. It really brings home the impossibility of these boys having survived in this underground bubble of air in the first place, as well as the impossibility of bringing them to the surface as more rain threatens to come and flood the cave entirely. \n\nAccording to reports, the film is entirely accurate except for one detail - it shows the cave water as being clear. This is obviously for the purposes of showing the underwater action as the divers, boys and air cylinders are squeezed through the tiniest of gaps, but it is certainly worth noting that the apparently impossible rescue was carried out in water so thick with mud that the divers lights were almost useless as they could see absolutely nothing. With that in mind the diver Vern was more crucial to the rescue than suggested in the film, with his pre-prepared divers map being the only thing that indicated where the divers in the flooded cave would be going. \n\nThere is one twist in the tale that I wasn't aware of. We were told at the time that the boys were taught how to use diving equipment and then swam out of the cave themselves. That, it turns out, was not the case, and the story at the time was a cover for what actually happened. \n\nColin Farrell and Viggo Mortensen do an unbelievable job of portraying divers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen and I have no doubt that is exactly as Mr Stanton and Mr Volanthen are as people. \n\nA fantastic true-life story and filmed exactly as it should've been filmed by Ron Howard. Worth watching by everybody. Don't be put off by the long running time - it felt like half the time when the story unfolded.",

I have him filed away in my mind as a safe pair of hands, a bit dull and prone to sentimentality. Sometimes true - but by no means always. I feared a film like this, telling a genuinely remarkable true story which we all know  - would play to the worst of those. The reverse is true. It brings out the best in Howard and those around him; it's understated in the best ways, there's a lack of sentimentality which makes it all the more moving, and it's success stems at least in part from an unpredictable creative decision which pays off well. Movies about disasters like to - need to, in fact - lay on a spectacular disaster. This doesn't show us any of that - perhaps because the involvement of children might have made it somehow exploitative  - and instead focuses on the widespread relief effort and the emotional toll on those involved. Most impressively it eschews a classic trap of these films - there is not a hint of the white saviour about all this. The breadth of those involved is always well portrayed, and no one person is in charge or more heroic than anyone else. Local customs, rituals and religion are to the fore. It packs a subtly powerful emotional punch, and it speaks to something deeper by choosing a path less often trod by these sorts of films.",

It's a gripping, intense and emotionally charged film of an incredible true story\u2026 however when considering the documentary that came before this\u2026 that was a better account of events. Hell, the only reason this movie really works and was so gripping and emotional is because it was a true story. It's just amazing to see what the human spirit can do, but the movie rides off the emotions of the true story and does nothing really creative itself. There's nothing to explore character-wise, and it plays literally like a dramatized version of the documentary. It's fine and good, it does work and it has impact, I just didn't think it was as strong as it could be, especially considering the incredible documentary made on this subject. The movie is also way too long, it didn't need to be 2.5 hours. I liked Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell's performances, and Ron Howard's direction is good (not as good as he used to be though). Overall it's a decent re-telling of an incredible true story. It's worth a watch, especially if you'd rather watch a narrative film over a documentary, and while I think the documentary is better, it's undeniable that this does do a good job telling the story and making you feel it's impact.",

The ensuing rescue mission that lasted over 2 weeks has now earned a Hollywood dramatization, capably directed by Ron Howard, which depicts how the rescuers, in particular a bunch of predominantly British cave-diving volunteers (underplayed by Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell) who have the necessary skills to navigate the treacherous underground/water terrains and who also hatch a risky plan to transport them back to safety. The film is a surprisingly tense though straightforward and conventional 2\u00bd hours that is restraint enough to convey the frustration and pressure involved without resorting to hysteria or melodrama; and sensitive and inclusive enough not to be just another portrayal of the Caucasian heroes coming in to save the day. Diligently recreating the claustrophobic and dangerous conditions the rescuers face, they've managed to make rainwater and undercurrents into a visual peril that the audience can understand and appreciate by showing the extensive damage it can cause or the consequences of either inexperience or just bad luck under the circumstances. Tension is further ramped up with visual aids that pop up intermittently at crucial moments to inform us precisely of the time and geography of each critical manoeuvre. Howard has proven success with the similar Apollo 13, where the outcome is already known to most viewers, yet it's the details we learn that aren't previously known that make it engaging and tense; and our knowledge of how it turned out works somewhat in its favour in the end, as we feel safe enough to enjoy the film without feeling guilty that we're simply indulging in disaster porn.",

It loses 1 half a point because it ignores the faith based component of the rescue, specifically the transcendental meditation used by the boys to survive without food for ELEVEN DAYS.

            "content": "This is based on a somewhat recent true story, one I remember hearing about on the news at the time. Its well made and certainly is quite tense and gripping at times, even though viewers will likely know the ultimate outcome. I reckon if your prone to claustrophobia then this is best avoided, as I felt it was quite atmospheric and they don't shy away from portraying the perilous situation the kids (and their coach) found themselves in. \n\nI found myself respecting the decisions and actions of the various cave rescue workers/volunteers, given what they were putting on the line and having to think up new solutions, or potential solutions, to try and rescue those stuck alive. I can only imagine how frustrating it must have been for the series of events that happens, the relationship between the volunteers/specialists and the media circus that gathers. Its a sobering watch and it'd be hard not to feel sorry, to one extent or another, to people in both sides of the proverbial camps I feel. It is a long film and I did feel less engaged at times, which maybe says more about my attention span than anything else (I'm annoyingly easily distracted at times). I noticed it often states on screen a duration and location, relating to where, I assume, the workers were - it didn't make sense to me initially that it seemed to say, for example, '8 hours 15 minutes' as if thats how long said 13 people had been stuck there, when I knew there were foreign helpers attempting to reach them - it would likely have taken over 8 hours for some of them to have reached the local area. That's perhaps my fault for not paying as much attention as I should have.\n\nI note that at first the British cave rescue helpers/workers were almost laughing off the situation in Thailand, which is frustrating to view. There's a sentiment (almost precisely these words) about 'well if they managed to get there, surely they can get themselves back out again as well' (seriously, its as simple as that?!). I can't comment how exaggerated or not that was - quite probably those used to working in different sorts of rescue scenarios may shrug off such an incident, given it wasn't (it'd seem) a situation that often happens.\n\nRon Howard has done well to treat the story with respect, I feel and I appreciate that the film does feature a fair amount (not exclusively but a fair bit) of the local language (Thai) and that there are numerous Thai characters, rather than it being entirely a list, Hollywood and British actors on screen. I think if this story intrigues you and the cast interests you then yes, I'd recommend this.",

That would've been crazy to see what they have done to survive. I highly doubt all they did was mediate for days. It's kinda crazy to think that these kids have the discipline for how many days again? Is it 10 days? Anyway it was a long long time and if I had to do that, I highly doubt I could. Those kids have guts. But again it would've been better if it was through their perspective or if it switched between them and the adults. In the end this is a great movie and I highly recommend.",

I was also surprised by the cast, I didn't know who was in it, and was pleasantly surprised to see Colin Farrell, and Viggo Mortensen, who both transformed into the characters, and were not immediately recognizable. Thankfully Amazon has that awesome feature that tells you the cast members when you hit pause. Anyway the movie was absolutely perfect.

Director Ron Howard has helmed this \"narrative\" version that features actors in the re-creation. There is some attention paid to the plight of families and authorities in Thailand, but most of the focus is on the English cave divers who led the effort (played by Colin Farrell, Viggo Mortensen & Joel Edgerton). While this version goes into more deeply into the fascinating procedure, it's also 2.5 hours long. Howard has told the story effectively, but there's surprisingly little emotion on display (the doc did it better). Still, if you haven't \"dived\" into the deets of this incident, it's an incredible true story of determination.",

            "content": "One of the most exciting rescues that they have given us in recent times is the one brought to the screen by the great Ron Howard in Thirteen Lives. The film based on the tragedy of the children of Thailand, is one of the most exciting surprises of the year and leaves the feeling that it should have been enjoyed longer in cinemas.\n\nA fairly solid recreation is the one that its director offers us about the planning and subsequent development of a rescue that seemed impossible and that ends with a satisfactory ending. Howard manages to take us at all times to the tension of being trapped in a cave for more than 20 days.\n\nThe story is supported in a good way on the shoulders of Viggo Mortensen and Col\u00edn Farrell who mix well with a totally international cast. With fairly correct performances, the film manages to convey the tension and anguish that such a tragedy means.\n\nThe drama grows throughout its 142-minute runtime and that is Howard's virtue that maintains the connection with the viewer throughout its duration, knowing that we all already knew the end of the story. The work that the director and cast do to bring you the reality of a tragedy in the most natural and credible way possible, allows us as viewers to always remain attentive to every detail.\n\nTechnically, the work is really surprising, Howard is not limited to putting the camera as one of those who collaborate with the mission and that allows us to experience the anguish from the first person, with great sequences underwater and out of it, in addition to having always that tension on screen without ever losing track of what was at stake.\n\nThe surprise ends up being that we find ourselves with a really solid and forceful film, taking the best of those films based on real events, it allows itself to maintain reality, without neglecting the fictional drama that a story brings to the cinema. A great plus achieved by his script and his direction, a story in good hands, always ends up being a good result.",

The script did not focus on the kids as much when they were stuck in the caves. Or there struggle on trying to dig there way out which was briefly discussed. The film does show the rescue teams desperate search for solutions on getting into the cave and out with the kids safely. Colin Farrell, Viggo Mortensen, and Joel Edgerton all did great with their roles. The film does get a bit of a thrill and suspense during the rescue mission.

Interesting for viewers with little to no knowledge of what happened, but the question remains as to whether it adds anything truly significant to the documentary The Rescue about the same 18 days of suffering, anxiety, and uncertainty.\n\nMassive praise for the worthy amount of screentime of the Thai language.\"",

However, as capably made as this picture is, its overlong 2:29:00 runtime can try the patience of viewers at times, especially when some of it sequences become drawn out and repetitive. This is by no means intended to diminish the uplifting nature of the story or the adeptness with which it has been produced cinematically, but, given the emphasis on the picture's technical merits, this approach to telling the tale tends to shortchange its tremendous emotional impact.  A journalistically styled by-the-numbers take on telling a story like this is fine, but I was hoping for something a little more heartfelt in light of the miracle this epically heroic yarn turned out to be. \"Thirteen Lives\" definitely earns a passing grade, but I can't help but wonder what it might have been with a little more emotion \u2013 and a lot more heart-tugging.",

What I didn't like mostly about the Thirteen Lives were the emphasis on drama over the actual rescue mission and how they actually did the rescue, as well as the mediocre acting of some Thai actors, which was baffling as they were pretty well known actors in the Thai industry. When I watched The Rescue, I actually felt like I was there with the divers every step of the way. Thirteen Lives does not really reveal all the interesting details during the dive, the rescue plan and the actual rescue as much as The Rescue, so if you are looking for something realistic, entertaining and educational, go for The Rescue (2021).",

But what really elevates this movie is the overwhelming inspiration that you just can't help but feel as you watch these events unfold. It's a story of people from all over the world coming together and putting their own selves aside in order to save lives. This film shows us the beauty of humanity, which is especially resonate today. The story of the Tham Luang cave rescue is an incredible one, and it's not always easy to translate real life events like this into film. But I think that this movie absolutely delivered and brings a thrilling, emotional, and deeply inspirational film that highlights what true heroes look like in the real world. It might be a bit long, and it starts to get a little repetitive with the diving scenes. I also wish that we could've gotten some more time with the kids while they were stranded in the cave.

The storyline is action-packed and extremely suspenseful. It felt like my heart was racing a million miles a minute while I watched it.  \n \nThirteen Lives takes us on the journey of twelve boys and their soccer coach getting stuck in the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand. The boys wanted to visit the cave; however, little did they know that there was an approaching monsoon that would soon after flood the entire cave. People from all over the world were watching their rescue attempt with the many challenging obstacles they had to overcome. Will someone find them inside the cave? If they do, will the boys get out of the cave in time before they starve, or run out of oxygen?\n \nThe acting in this film is phenomenal. The portrayal of these young boys, their coach and their rescuers is so believable that you feel like you are there along with them. The cast includes Colin Farrell as John Volanthen, Viggo Mortensen as Richard Stanton, Joel Edgerton as Richard Harris and Tom Bateman as Chris Jewell. The production team, led by director Ron Howard also delivered. The way the film is made makes you feel like you're actually in the cave with the rescue workers. It took a lot of effort and coordination, which is very impressive. Over 5,000 people, including cave divers, doctors, rescuers, Navy SEALS, farmers and others contributed to helping the boys. They put their own lives at risk to help the boys and their coach, whom they didn't even know! Without those people playing a part in this rescue who knows if they would have saved them. My favorite part is when the farmers give up their crops so water can flood them and divert the water from going into the cave. It took a lot of heroism and sacrifice to lose their entire crop in order to give the boys a better chance of surviving.\n \nThe message of this film is that working together is essential. You should be aware that there is a lot of blood in some scenes and there is some bad language used a couple of times.\n \nI give Thirteen Lives 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This film releases in select theaters on July 29, 2022, and starts streaming on Prime Video August 5, 2022. By Sydney S., KIDS FIRST!",

They do a really good job with recreating the cave and the situation and even though we know what happens from news reports, the suspense and drama is still felt.
