The sequel was not needed but I'm glad that the story was able to be flushed out even more and feel like it's own thing on top of adding more to the original.",

            "content": "Alfred Hitchcock once said\n\n\"there is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.\"\n\nwalking into the theatre, it is natural for you to think, is there really the need of a sequel? is it just gonna be another cash grab or there really is more story to tell which can match the complex narrative and high stakes of the first film which was so perfect in every way? believe me, in the climax, you'll literally start clapping to the film's genius.\n\nthe film starts off with the anticipation that Vijay and his family from the first film might, they just might get caught for their crime they committed 7 years ago and managed to get away with it by fooling the entire police department just on the basis of visual deception.\n\nthe film starts off slow prioritizing the world-building and characters over the plot, but that's just the beginning, because the payoff it gives at the end (trust me, it's even more bonkers now) is just phenomenal. having written a script myself (which took me 3 weeks by the way), I can only imagine of getting such wild and risky ideas to put in the climax. cheers to the original writer Jeethu Jospeh for coming up with such unique concepts and connecting them to cinema.\n\najay devgn once again beautifully portrays the protagonist (still scecptical on this one) Vijay Salgaonkar who appears stoic and calm on the outside but is planning everything to keep the secret \"buried\" on the inside. tabu as this ex-cop turned grieving mother out for revenge and closure is just a perfect follow-up to the original film. kamlesh savant returns in his role as Gaitonde and does not disappoint, he still oozes the same anger he had 7 years ago on Vijay for ruining his career because he was the only one who knew the truth behind it all but lacked the evidence to prove it. but, out of all the returning cast members, it was Akshaye Khanna, the new addition to this universe, that stole the show. just his presence is enough to make the screen shine and his dialogue delivery is enough to give you the chills.\n\nthe soundtrack once again, fucks hard. absolutely thrilling and apt for the scenes. athough, it isn't Vishal Bhardwaj who has composed it, Anil Johnson does manage to keep up with him and provide some good scores.\n\none thing I would like to point out is that the film also delves deeper into Vijay's mindset as a person. it perfectly depicts how Vijay and his family with him will have to be in fear their entire lives just to keep the crime they committed a secret. even though, they are free, freedom isn't with them. there is a beautiful line at the end of the film which goes like, \"even if Vijay manages to escape the cops with his wits forever, he will never be able to match eyes with the parents of Sameer Deshmukh (the boy who was murdered in the first film)\" indicating how ashamed he is and his life itself is his punishment.\n\na perfect sequel, that's it. Vijay Salgaonkar is indeed, the smartest man alive.\n\nP.S.: this film does a few things different than the original Mohanlal film in order to streamline the runtime and it does manage to do so successfully, but deep down, I feel that it was Georgekutty's (Mohanlal) journey that comes a step above (you'll understand it if you watch the original Malayalam film) and shines just a little brighter than this.",

Once again the brilliant Vijay finds himself battling with the ghosts of past sins, except this time the grim reaper is the new, determined Inspector General Tarun, played well by Khanna. I am impressed they brought back all the old players and seamlessly jumped ahead 7 long years. I am even more blown away at how Vijay anticipated exactly how these threats would play out, down to the minutest detail. This time his manipulation of illusion extends beyond the local game to the system itself. His enemies never stood a chance, so well thought out is his every move, so well crafted the narrative defenses around his little world. There is a nice touch of closure to this sequel, with human kindness between enemies. It is hard to imagine how they can extend this amazing series to a 3rd installment.",

This movie moves around Vijay(Ajay Devgn) and his family which met with an unfortunate incident 7 years ago on 2nd october 2014, when his daughter Anju(Ishitta Dutta) accidentally kills Sameer son of IG Meera Deshmukh(Tabu) . To protect her , vijay burries the body in garden , which at end of the first movie we understand that the body was burried inside the police station ,and this twist made Drishyam one of the best suspense thrillers of the time .Coming to the secound movie where vijay and his family are having good time when the new IG Arun(Akshay khanna) enters the movie and reopens the case for his friend Meera as they both were batchmates during there training. Unfortunately somebody sees vijay buring the body and opens that news to the police and police find the body and start the investigation again on vijay and take him and his family into the custody , Gaitaonde tortures his wife and daughters in front of vijay making him to confess everything .\nI could have written about the ending as well ,as i have already given so many spoilers but i really suggest you to take some time out and watch the movie available on prime video .The stars given to this movie are all based on the twists in the end . Overall movie is bit slow yet intresting .\nThanks \nSidhibaat NoBakwaas",

On the night of 2 October 2014, a man named David fled from the police after having murdered his brother-in-law. Hiding behind an unfinished police station, he sees Vijay exiting it. Afterwards, he attempts to apologize to his wife but ends up getting arrested. On the other hand Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay) who was the owner of Mirage Cables has established a cinema and wants to continue his passion for making films. He's an aspiring producer now. His family is constantly living in tension about what will happen to them if the truth comes out. His elder daughter, Anju played by Ishita Dutta who's suffering from trauma after Sam's murder. His younger daughter, Anu played by Mrunal Jadhav is now a big girl and his wife, Nandini played by Shriya Saran is always living in tension. They have new neighbors Jenny and Shiv, a couple living next door. Meanwhile the police got a clue and reopened the case. Tarun Ahlawat is the new IG of the police played by Akshaye Khanna who's now investigating the case. The events formed the rest of the plot. Will Vijay Salgaonkar be able to save his family this time Or is it all over for him? Watch the film to know more. Performances of all the actors were awesome. Although my favourite performances were of Akshaye Khanna and of course Ajay Devgn. Tabu's role was limited but important. Others were brilliant. The STORY was the winner. GREAT WRITING. The FINAL TWIST left me FLABBERGASTED. Overall, it's a MUST WATCH.",
