But I finally watched it at home and now can only hope it'll be back in theaters someday so I can get the full big screen experience. They did a wonderful job! Not only did it have all the nostalgia you'd expect, but also a fresh new story that really could've been a movie by itself without being a sequel. Highly recommend for those who loved the first one or for anyone who just want to enjoy a good movie. 5 stars all around!",

The characters ride motor bikes, have pretty love interests, & like dogfighting plane battles. It's nothing groundbreaking, but a good summer blockbuster considering today's film climate. In decades past it would've been like a 78 out of 100 type grade (like a normal, fun, testosterone-filled, summer blockbuster) but I think the recent heavy-handed nature of Hollywood's political & social themes that incessantly gets injected into scripts...I think that climate subconsciously might make viewers feel refreshed after seeing a movie like this. The political topics you expect to be forcefully injected into the script or the social themes you expect to be forcefully projected onto the main characters, aren't there. It's literally the definition of K.I.S.S. ('keep it simple stupid'). Thus had it been made in 1960's - 2000s, we'd consider it average to above average summer blockbuster. Because it's made in 2022 however, I find myself giving it credit for the things it doesn't do more so than the things it does. Worth a watch especially for older male audiences.",

The plot of the film follows Maverick as he returns to the Top Gun academy as an instructor, where he meets a group of young pilots who are training for a dangerous mission involving a new stealth jet program. Among them is Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of Maverick's late friend and wingman Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw. Maverick also rekindles his romance with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), a single mother and bar owner who happens to be the daughter of his former commander.\n\n\"The movie features spectacular aerial sequences that will leave you breathless, with top-notch special effects that bring the action to life. The film delivers on its promise of exhilarating aerial action scenes, featuring stunning cinematography by Claudio Miranda and impressive practical effects that showcase Cruise's dedication to performing his own stunts. The film also pays homage to the original with references to iconic moments and characters, such as Val Kilmer's return as Admiral Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, Maverick's former rival turned friend.\"\n\nThat's why Tom Cruise once again proves that he is one of the most iconic action stars of all time, bringing a level of intensity and nuance to his performance that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Jennifer Connelly and Miles Teller.\"\n\nThe film's score, composed by Harold Faltermeyer, is a nostalgic throwback to the original that is sure to get your heart racing. The editing is sharp, maintaining a steady pace that keeps the action flowing and never feels stale.\n\nOverall, Top Gun: Maverick is a triumph of filmmaking that will thrill audiences of all ages. It's a fitting tribute to the original and a testament to the enduring power of the franchise. Whether you're a fan of the original or new to the world of Top Gun, this movie is a must-see. I highly recommend it!",

It does not promote war, but instead shows the importance of having a strong defense, as history does repeat itself. Because of individuals who are willing to defend our country, at the risk of their own lives, America is not ending but is continuing to fight for democracy.

Peter \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) has remained a \"captain\" in the 35 or so years since the action of the original movie while his contemporaries had moved on to bigger (and more bureaucratic) positions. This movie is a throwback in all the right ways. At first, the \"danger zone\" opening got me going, but I had concerns that the sequel would rely heavily on nostalgia without providing much of a story \u2014 these concerns were quickly assuaged. In fact, instead of going back to 1986, we are set into hyperdrive into the future as Maverick test-flies a plane for his pioneered \"Darkstar\" program, which continues with manhandled flight instead of the transition to drones. Besides this scene just being beautiful, it sets the tone for the movie that provides a blend of classic military competition (both in the air and shirtless ball-playing on the beach), a well-paced \u2014 but not overbearing \u2014 love story, and practical effects action. I was surprised, however, that the plane doesn't make a reappearance. \"Hangman\" (Glen Powell) is a \"villain\" straight out of a 1980s teen ski movie and antagonist to \"Rooster\" (Miles Teller), \"Goose's\" son who provides the motivation for Maverick throughout the story. The nameless, faceless villain is back and of course, I have the knee-jerk reaction of questioning why we're just bombing a sovereign nation, but that's not what this story is about. Top Gun is and always has been an isolated story of one school, one program, one class. Upon reflection, I didn't need the larger geopolitics \u2014 I also very much appreciated that they kept the \"controversial\" Taiwan patch on Maverick's jacket. Top Gun: Maverick is the type of cinematic experience I just don't get from Marvel movies or Avatar and I couldn't be happier that this sort of movie still exists.",

Tom Cruise looks exactly the same as he did 36 years ago.\n\nThis movie is fun on its own - it's fast-paced, it's badass, you care about the characters.\n\nBut it also hits all the notes of nostalgia without being too much. Miles Teller's character pays homage to his father by playing Great Balls of Fire on the piano on the beach. Val Kilmer reprising his role is absolutely epic. Sweaty aviators playing beach sports together. They've even got a pretty dope soundtrack, just like the first Top Gun.\n\nThere are also some nice updates for the modern era. There are female pilots for example. And Maverick realizes that it's not cool to be a total dick to women anymore. Like, they have feelings and families. Not really a thing in the 80s.\n\nUnfortunately, Meg Ryan had to step aside to make space for a new story, a decision I didn't want, but ultimately think was the right call.\n\nI didn't want to like this movie as much as I did, but it's nearly perfect. See it in theaters if you can, but definitely see it.\n\nFinally, thanks to Miles Teller for making summer '22 the summer of mustaches.",

Everybody pulled their weight and played their character properly that by the end of the the movie, I have to say that I liked every character in the movie.\nStory wise, having Mav still dealing with the loss of Goose and also being a step in father figure and teacher to Rooster (Goose's son) is an odd yet very welcomed changed to the tone of the movie compared to the first.  Furthermore, having the Navy going against a \"faceless\" enemy is a smart thing to do as it provides good tension to the story.  The romance is much better handled this time round with a much more respectful Mav towards woman, and no cringy unnecessary sex scenes.\nMusic-wise, excellent compositions and song from Zimmer, Gaga and Faltermeyer.  One Republic's mid movie song is an absolute bop.\nThe cinematography and editing is on point.  Having the pilots being in actual plains and shooting a fighter jet from another jet, really made every shot breathtaking to watch on an IMax screen.  There's barely any CG to break the immersion of the story because the planes were really flying in the sky, and explosions for the most part are practically made.  \n\nOverall, this is an absolute must watch and Blu-Ray purchase.  Hollywood needs to know that these are the types of movies that people want to watch.  No offense to the MCU (I love the MCU),  superhero movies just don't have the charm of what movies like Top Gun can offer.  If you have the chance to watch it in streaming, or replaying at your local cinema, do give it a watch.",

Through the wise and clever direction of Joseph Kosinski, a master in sequels and sagas, he becomes a real character, a real flight instructor and pilot, albeit gifted of a \"superhuman\" strength; however, he isn't anymore the protagonist of a propagandistic 1,40 hour long ad like the first chapter. After more than 30 years, due to the will of a dying \"Iceman\" (the performance of Val Kilmer is very touching), now admiral of the navy, test pilot Dave Mitchell is transferred to the Top Gun division with the goal to train a team that has to destroy an uranium enrichment plant; among these young pilots Cruise finds Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of his close friend and RIO \"Goose\"; moreover, in the old bar near the base, he meets one of his old flames, Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly). A film critic once said that one clich\u00e9 is ridiculous, one hundred all togheter makes you cry. And this movie does so as well as exploring many human relations: on all, the misunderstandings between Teller and Cruise and the disillusioned love between the latter and Connelly. Lady Gaga's \"hold my hand\" is very beautiful in addition to the historic song from the first film.",

Yes; simply stunning and shot in a way that truthfully makes you feel as if you're in the cockpit. These scenes are numerous throughout the film and really form the basis for devouring this popcorn movie. Outside of the planes though the story can get threadbare and forced. The main plot involves Maverick training new Top Guns to destroy an unmarked uranium processing plant in an unnamed country using tactics loudly reminiscent of The Death Star trench run including having to fit a missile into a missile-sized hole. Some might say the hole isn't much bigger than a womp rat. Anyways, the out-of-cockpit stuff meanders, but Tom Cruise's devil-may-care demeanor helps sell the package and this is the other main reason why Top Gun: Maverick is so impressive. The entire plot is built on top of a landfill of clich\u00e9s, but somehow it works and the film might even be better for it. One of Maverick's students happens to be Goose's son (Miles Teller as Rooster), inevitable conflict emerges. Maverick bumps into his old flame Penny (played by Jennifer Connelly) and while the film would like us to believe that it was happenstance it can't sell that conclusion very well. The rest of Maverick's class of Top Guns might as well be faceless they're so paper-thin. It all culminates almost exactly the way you think it will and still it was a joy. It's a strange film that shouldn't work, and occasionally it doesn't albeit briefly, but largely does due to its willingness to lean into the fun campiness of a summer action film despite costing something in predictability. This is a risky gambit, expecting people to know what they want is historically a fool's errand. But Cruise and company pull it off with this exciting blockbuster that's worth going to the theater to see.",

Just too much Tom Cruise glorifying himself to give a full 5 stars. I do commend him for his flying skills. That's legit. No way this movie succeeds without real piloting. There's no way dated jets survive the \"gen 5\" supersonic fighters, but that is easily overlooked for movie drama. Stealing a foreign jet and surviving without ammo against \"gen 5\", laughable. Not to mention the suicide mission plan being a direct ripoff from the original Star Wars. Redeeming scenes include the training session in which Cruise flys the practice course for all to witness. And, the training defeats of all the young pilots. Would it be better in a theater? Not much. Would I watch it again? Parts, but not the whole. Bollywood cheese doesn't sit well in my stomach.",

Usually when you have a war movie (which this was.. in a sense) the bad guy is someone you want to see get what was coming to them, but this film was the first I can remember where the enemy was just \"the enemy\". It was a paper bad guy and to this day, I don't know who they were supposed to be. The 6th Gen fighters certainly looked Chinese but the bad guys running around where Caucasians. I liked the sentimentality element but I didn't like some of the casting particularly Miles Teller. I saw him as a bad guy in a couple of movies. He played them very well but his persona is just not sympathetic. Strangely enough, Hangman despite the overbearing cockiness was great and would have been a better SOG (son of Goose).

This film was published in 2001 so I thought the graphics may not be the best but kept that at the back of my mind while watching this. The story is shambolic and if it got released nowadays it would be as the young chaps say 'cancelled'. This film sent me to hospital and I am writing this review from a mental asylum.

This one is even more technical and more accurate, but boring is never an adjective that could describe this film, given its thrilling spectacle. The nostalgia is there, but it tells an original story that adds depth to what had already been established.

There was a scene where Cruise had his shirt off on the beach, there was a sex scene. There was even a vintage Porsche, oh and a local bar.  I just thought REALLY?  They even had someone playing 'Great Balls of Fire' at the piano.  The first movie was great. The second was a complete copycat.  \n\nThe storyline in the end was fun, and there was suspense, and Maverick vs. The Military.  There was also some emotional turmoil which helped the plot.

The slick film has adrenaline-filled action, but also heart, particularly in its handling of Van Kilmer's appearance as Maverick's former nemesis, Iceman. Its pacing keeps your attention in the way that old-school stories used to, with an engaging narrative and solid performances that make seeing it at the cinema a real experience.

            "content": "Top Gun: Maverick is my all-time favorite film, and I have watched it numerous times in theaters. The film is a thrilling and emotionally powerful story about Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), who is tasked with training (and later leading) a group of TOPGUN graduates to strike a uranium enrichment plant in a foreign country. One of the graduates is Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller), who is the son of Maverick's best friend, Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw, who died. Maverick's conflict with Rooster gradually escalates throughout the film.\n\nMaverick has guilt and feels responsible for Goose's death, and this is a central theme throughout the film. His relationship with Penny Benjamin (played by Jennifer Connelly) is pivotal to both of their character arcs as he begins to treat her with more respect and consideration rather than just engaging in casual encounters. Tom Cruise delivers an impressive performance in a scene where Maverick visits Iceman (Val Kilmer) at his house and is torn over whether or not to send Rooster on a risky mission. Maverick is conflicted because if he sends Rooster, he may not come back alive, but if he doesn't send him, Rooster will never forgive him for pulling his naval academy papers and not believing he can fly the mission.\n\nThe final battle in the film borrows the concept of the final battle from the first Star Wars film and showcases the strong bond between Maverick and Rooster as they work together to take down enemy jets. They use their skills and determination to complete their mission and emerge victorious. The practical filmmaking techniques used in the film add to the sense of realism, making the film an immersive and engaging experience. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, Lorne Balfe, and Harold Faltemeyer, adds to the excitement with its intense and thrilling pieces of music.\n\nOverall, Top Gun: Maverick is a well-acted, emotionally powerful film with exciting action scenes and a thrilling score. The themes of personal conflict and overcoming guilt are explored in a nuanced and complex way, and the characters of Maverick and Rooster are fully fleshed out and compelling. This movie is not just for fans of action films, but for everyone who enjoys well-crafted storytelling with emotional depth and complex character development. With its inspiring message of overcoming personal challenges and trusting in your instincts, Top Gun: Maverick is my all-time favorite film and one that will leave you feeling uplifted and motivated. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch.",

In the original Tom Cruise played 'Maverick', a hotshot young Naval pilot at the Top Gun Academy. In the time since he has never risen above the rank of Captain, preferring to keep flying and not be in command of anything. In this sequel he is called back to teach a bunch of new young pilots on how to take on a very dangerous mission.

Still recommend the movie BUT really wish it would highlight motorcycle safety as well. Helmet can match his flying helmet! We all know it's him and the same for Penny (J.C.).",

The story is not fresh is the classic, \" Get the lonely old guy to teach the young who is the boss and do what nobody thought was possible while struggling to overcome his own past...\". \nSo, why so many stars? Because the Production was incredible, the acting of all te cast was on point and perfect, all of them had their time to shine, the length was just right and the most important part the nostalgia was a strong factor.  If you haven't seen it yet,  you should do it, even if you didn't watch or like the the 1986 movie.  This movie brings the \"80s American patriotism in movies\" in a way that is not in your face to the point that you dislike it because you are not American or feel that the action sequences are over the top.  Tom cruise is a legit action hero, no actor can be compared to him in action sequences, it is a treat to  have the opportunity to watch his movies.",

The filmmaking was impeccable, with clear and streamlined action sequences that made the spectacle feel fun instead of mandatory.

Top Gun was also a good movie because of the excitement you get from watching the movie. Also, it was a good move because it had a lot of the same characters that the original movie had.\n\tTop Gun: Maverick is a movie about the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School(Top Gun) this is where the top fighter pilot gets more training to produce the best pilots in the world and it worked.\nTop Gun: Maverick followed to first movie's plot very well, it even included the first movie's plot into it. For example, Maverick's(Tom Cruise) co-pilot's (Anthony Edwards) son(Miles Teller) went to the Top Gun school, and in the movie, they showed conflicts between the son and Maverick that reflect what happened in the original movie Top Gun. \nTop Gun: Maverick is a movie that gives you a lot of excitement because, as you are watching it the plot develops but not in a way where you can predict the entire movie. For example when you are watching scenes where the piolets are making hard turns to avoid crashing into a mountain. The camera angles allow very focused people to get hints about what the movie is going to be about and who it's going to be about.\nAnother reason why it's a good movie is that it has some of the same characters as the movie. Also, the new characters that they have are likable characters not just a replacement for the old character. For example, Tom Cruise is in both movies and the directors did not replace him. The Movies were made 36 years apart but seems like they were made right after each other because the plot flows from one movie to another. The places in the movie are the same as the original movie places this adds a level of detail that I have not seen in any other movie. \nAlthough some people might say that it relies on the plot of the first movie, I would disagree because the movie does a good job of explaining some of what happened in the first movie. Also, the movie is a movie that follows a plot line connected to the first movie so if you were to watch the second movie then you would probably watch the first. \nTop Gun: Maverick was a good movie. It follows the plot of the first movie very well. Top Gun: Maverick is a movie that brings the watcher a lot of excitement watching the plot of the movie develop but not in the way you expected it to. The Movie has a lot of the same characters as the first movie. Top Gun: Maverick is the best movie that I have seen.",

The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.\n\nThe overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final \"suicide\" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.\n\nThe performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.\n\nThis film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters. I really enjoyed this and I am definitely not one who fancies these types of films, but it captured me.\n\nScore: 87%\nVerdict: Excellent",

Top Gun: Maverick presents the argument that any man, woman or person of color is capable of excellence without sacrificing plot, contriving script, or assassinating character. It does so without any need to present the female in the guise of a male in order to elevate her, and without the need to crucify the male lead in order to satisfy a resentful audience. \n\nWhat is most admirable about this movie is how it delivers on incredibly human themes that are vital, now more than ever before, to our current culture. Screen writers Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, and Christopher McQuarrie seamlessly present extremely important themes such as selflessness, confidence, how to take a woman's breath away, and how to create enduring friendships forged in competition. It even dares to present Commander \"Iceman\" Kazansky in a rather female light, as a patient, supportive, and compassionate authority. Take that, intersectionality! Family members of the enlisted will appreciate how director Joseph Kosinski does his very best to relay the incredible depth of feeling and emotion that is saying goodbye to a loved one that is headed into battle. All of this while developing a flawed protagonist who struggles to overcome his demons and deliver the best man he can be. \n\n\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is a true hero story, the likes of which we grew up on, and one that will inspire endless generations to come.",

I adore the original, but this one is better in every aspect, the action is better, how do you even shoot something like this man. I cried like 4 times during this movie, all the old nostalgia references to the original have a special place in your heart and it just makes you emotional.

            "content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess to backtracking on a statement I made on social media when this film was first released. At that time, I had said I wouldn't see this movie because I believed it to be little more than a veiled recruiting vehicle for the US military and that it was something I couldn't support. However, awards season accolades for this offering backed me into a corner, essentially forcing me into having to see it to remain informed and credible about the unfolding of these events, so I reluctantly relented. Unfortunately, after having watched it, my initial assessment was borne out. This overblown, testosterone-dripping, clich\u00e9d, corny, predictable 2+-hour ad for the US Navy lived up to all of my expectations. This tale of an aging fighter ace-turned-test pilot (Tom Cruise) who's tapped to train a team of young flyers for a virtually impossible bombing run to take out a plutonium enrichment plant in Iran (no enemy stereotyping here, ahem) follows a formulaic script with trite dialogue and plenty of sly macho winks and nods. To its credit, the film features superb aerial camera work and editing, making for a number of visually thrilling dogfight sequences (a major \"cool, dude\" aspect of the picture's underlying military marketing intentions), and it manages to slip in a few \"sensitive male\" story threads to show that modern-day enlisted men can be at least superficially politically correct (a changing-of-the-times narrative adjustment from the film's original). But, even with these admirable attributes, I genuinely fail to understand how so many critics and viewers don't see what's really going on here. To say that director Joseph Kosinski's latest is truly worthy of the honors it has received thus far \u2013 such as a Golden Globe nomination for best dramatic film and the National Board of Review's award for the year's best picture \u2013 is clearly an overreach, especially in terms of what it's really all about to begin with. In my view, it's yet another example of the decline of the American movie industry and how willing audiences are to settle for it.",

The visuals are stunning to say the least, and it all feels so realistic - especially when sat in a cinema which is where it must be watched. Top Gun: Maverick has proven that cinemas and the cinema experience still matters. And despite a somewhat overused plot, this film overcomes that by having all the characters deal with the emotions of the first one.",

            "content": "This movie deserves more than any o scars or Grammies. Quite possibly a movie of the century? \n\nFrom all sides it tackles the perfect movie for anyone to sit down & watch, unless vertigo inside a jet isn't your thing :) \n\nIt's brilliantly done in how it tries to follow after the sequel (can't blame anyone if actors/actresses don't want to come back to the role, though it does make a few things confusing such as Maverick's seemingly main love interest who appears to not be the same woman.) Aside from that, I applause in how this movie takes on the cursed \"diversity\" role.\nIt's subtle & that's exactly what the world outside of the USA needs. Not everyone has the same problems as this country & upon seeing black media (& etc) shoved down their throats, it becomes unpleasant (The Little Mermaid (2023), Wakanada Forever, The Woman King) these movies fail, terribly.\n\nWhat Top Gun: Maverick does is that it still shows diversity in characters but it's done so in a subtle way that yes, you notice it, but those characters aren't making it their entire personality. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Everyone got a bit of screen time & it was well executed. Each diverse background character still left a lasting impression that you'll remember & relate to them but not so much as a struggle for centrepiece. Everyone knows that this was Maverick's story, not theirs. While the characters were interesting it was done in a way that yes they still mattered & you could relate to them without having the feeling of them just being there for the sake of diverse roles. \n\nThe story between Rooster & Maverick is written beautifully, the entire story is, even the comedic parts. A brief nostalgic moment from the 1980s is seemingly what everyone wants to see in the theatres but with a slightly more modern twist. We still love watching the original Top Gun of course but seeing Top Gun: Mavericks gives us a sense of moving on, growing up & facing the fears of a world that we no longer are used to which makes it all the more exciting & breath-holding.\n\nSpeaking of which, when seeing this in the cinemas, the photography was absolutely stunning. Amazing & memorable soundtrack also, though it may not get stuck in your head like it's predecessor, it's nice enough to listen to & recognise where it's from. The patriotic parts of the American military aren't so heavily as pressed either, so in a way, you're still cheering for them, even though they're not your military & you don't know who they're fighting but you still hold your breath & hope they'll win. \n\nThis movie is a 100% brilliant in all aspects & should serve as an example of what media should strive to be when serving its people. In a technological world where everyone can see everything, this should be the golden standard of media & I hope more people in the industry strive to become like this. Whilst not all movies are action & military & romance, Top Gun: Maverick serves a healthy portion of each genre without being overbearing. \n\nPs. For those arguing of the whole \u2018propaganda' aspect, so be it. The brotherhood of the military does make you think that maybe there's a family waiting for you or maybe it's just not your thing. Whatever it may be, just know that it took them almost 40 years to make a sequel, which probably cost a lot & the US military (navy) told them that they could do whatever they wanted, so long as Tom Cruise didn't touch the controls ;) wicked.",

There are a ton of new characters & all of them add to the ensemble without overshadowing or belittling the main characters. And best of all, this isn't a tale of having the old dog retire so the young pups can take over. He is teaching them to be the next generation, but they aren't there to replace him in future movies. Also, many of the original cast reprise their roles, including a welcomed surprise I won't ruin here. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend watching this instant classic.

They abound in so many advertisements from the 1980s to the internet memes of today. For the longest time, I always felt that was all there was to the movie. I eventually sat down and saw the movie a few years ago in its entirety and I finally understood the hype. I saw it for a whole week, and I had so much fun watching it. 1986 had modest movies but it was Top Gun that dominated the year. I also remembered that there was no sequel, at least not in theaters but countless video games were made in the arcades and consoles. I figured that was how it was always going to be what with Tom Cruise wanting to be an actor with a substantial career. Not even Cruise taking over a franchise with Mission Impossible could make me believe he would ever make a sequel and if he did, it wouldn't compare. I think it is more than fair to say I was wrong.\n\n2022. Thirty-six years after the original movie was made, a sequel was finally made and it's not just as good as the original, it's better! Though to be fair, it looks like 2022 has been another modest year for movies, its only fair Top Gun dominates. The story goes as follows, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell has gone from being the US Naval Aviator Lieutenant into a US Naval Aviator Captain, distinguished beyond distinguished. But his age is keeping him from getting all the assignments he got when he was in his twenties. But he's getting one last shot at the place that made him, Top Gun. Only the story here is not so much himself as it is for the past. Ordered to teach a new generation of Top Gun graduates how to fly a nearly impossible mission, he gets in trouble with someone very dear to him, Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, the son of his beloved best friend from the first movie Goose.\n\nFrom here is an entertaining tale of action and drama that goes to show that despite the many years and different directors, a great story is a great story. Tom Cruise hasn't lost a step like Maverick, showing age is just a number. But it's the beauty of seeing Val Kilmer, a talented actor having been absent for a decade is explained here. With many new faces but welcome faces with callbacks to the old. I couldn't imagine loving this movie as much as I did. Truly the best movie of the year.",

For true military riders it's almost always ATGATT or not ride at all.\nIn the behind the scenes making the movie companion and stunt riders wore ATGATT (All The Gear All The Time). Willing to change a flag to appease a Communist regime but not do something so simple as wear head gear. What is wrong with this guy? Again this is a Single One Issue review, Can someone legitimately find any military (let alone a runway or taxiway) not do anything about PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)? This is just not reality.\nAbout me: I've worn ATGATT from my very first ride at the CHiP training. Long before it was required by law in 1992.",

The music is also brilliant, with a soundtrack that slays and a score by none other than Hans Zimmer.

I was disappointed to not see Kelly McGillis, Tom Skerrit, Michael Ironside, or Meg Ryan in it. I was happy to see Val Kilmer reprise his role as Iceman, but it would have been nice if some of the original cast was brought back, adding to the nostalgia of the film. But the flight sequences and aerobatics with the planes was amazing and the footage was incredible. I really liked how the brought the F-14 in at the end as a nod to the old film and honoring its predecessor, putting Maverick and Rooster into the same cockpit scenario that Maverick and Goose were in. Like father like son. I have watched this movie numerous times and I will never get tired of watching it. Cant wait to see if they do a third one .",

            "content": "Tom Cruise delivers Oscar worthy lead acting in a heartfelt sequel to Top Gun.\n\nDirector Joseph Kosinski's war action-drama Top Gun: Maverick (2022) pays tribute to Tony Scott's Top Gun with stunning cinematography, heartfelt characters, and exhilarating aerial combat. I'd like to think that Tony Scott would be proud of Kosinski for keeping Top Gun character driven. Writers Christopher McQuarrie, Ehren Kruger, Justin Marks, Peter Craig, and Eric Warren Singer nail the mature tone and softer story about aging, grief, forgiveness, comradery, rekindled love, and promises. Top Gun: Maverick's moving drama is surprising and welcomed alongside thrilling aerial battles with Tom Cruise uplifting the film into soaring new heights.\n\nKosinski's direction shoots all these insane aerial dogfights with real Navy jets that are genuinely astonishing to behold. I personally appreciate his character focus to portray how Maverick is still grieving the loss of Goose and guilty over not being able to save his friend. Kosinski has now directed Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, and Top Gun: Maverick that I enjoyed very much, so he continues to be a fascinating director. His sincere approach to drama and then striking visuals for action feels smooth and effortless. Top Gun: Maverick is something special.\n\nEddie Hamilton's editing is slick with these cool transitions from talking to flying. The plane sequences are cut with an easy to follow continuity that's easier to read than even the first Top Gun. I found cinematographer Claudio Miranda's wide shots in the sky truly breathtaking. There's nothing more impressive visually than the camera right on the plane or looking out the jet window out at the Sun. All the close-ups during Maverick's conversation with Iceman actually got me crying.\n\nTom Cruise is phenomenal and subtle in a wonderfully understated dramatic return as Top Gun pilot Maverick. He's engaging and concerned for his fellow pilots as Cruise ensures you know how worried and conflicted Maverick now feels. He's an old hero aging out of the flight programs in the Navy and Maverick feels he has to help these young pilots return home safely out of reverence for his lost friend Goose from Top Gun. Cruise will get tears out of you in a tender and sophisticated acting performance from Cruise in the middle of an action movie. His heartfelt scene doubting himself with Val Kilmer's bittersweet return as Iceman is very touching. Tom Cruise can still do incredible dramatic work as an actor, not just a triumphant action star.\n\nJennifer Connelly is fantastic and moving as Penny Benjamin in a cute rekindled love interest and appreciated age appropriate relationship for Tom Cruise's Maverick. She feels forward and mature with a playful liveliness. I like how she is there to encourage Maverick, while demanding he really love her and be himself again. She's a steadfast lover and a wonderful choice for Maverick's new flame. Lyliana Wray is nice and serious as Penny's protective daughter Amelia Benjamin. I loved her line directly telling Maverick not to break her mother's heart ever again. I like to think she's really his daughter from back then, even though that's not in the script.\n\nMiles Teller is stern and frustrated as the angry Rooster. He holds his own against a forlorn and guilty Tom Cruise when Rooster and Maverick are arguing about his continued desire to fly dangerously. I think he does a respectable job as Goose's son.\n\nJon Hamm's stern and condescending Vice Admiral Cyclone is interesting as he wants obedience from Maverick and success even at the potential cost of Naval pilots' lives. Glen Powell steals all his scenes as a charismatic and arrogant pilot named Hangman because he leaves his team out to hang at the sign of trouble. Lewis Pullman looks just like his dad Bill Pullman as the nerdy and quiet Bob, who is very honest and steadfast.\n\nEd Harris cameos as the blunt and furious Rear Admiral Hammer. Monica Barbaro is pretty and confident as Phoenix in a nice supporting role for her. Charles Parnell is quite touching as Warlock, especially in his supportive and knowing moments with Tom Cruise's Maverick. Jay Ellis' Payback, Danny Ramirez' Fanboy, Greg Tarzan Davis' Coyote, and Bashir Salahuddin's Hondo all get their moments. Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer's score are massive and powerful like Lady Gaga's wonderful soundtrack single for Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nIn all, Top Gun: Maverick is worth seeing for sure. Tom Cruise's magnetic performance is thoughtful and moving, while Kosinski's fighter plane dogfights are unreal to witness.",

However, that didn't matter. In the movie, Tom Cruise (Maverick) is in charge of recent Top Gun graduates, including the son (Miles Teller) of his deceased best friend. I liked how the audience can easily make this connection even without having knowledge about the previous Top Gun movie. This cinematic masterpiece was intense, loud, action-filled, funny, imaginative, and even included a touch of romance. For generally not being a huge action genre lover, this movie surprised me. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, anticipating what was going to happen next. Throughout the cast, there was a perfect balance of all sorts of personalities and each actor/actress fit into their respective roles perfectly. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller made an unstoppable duo that was both unexpected and uneasy at first. It is a must-see movie, and I would recommend it to anyone. From the beginning up until the very end, I found myself loving every second. I can guarantee it's one of those movies that you are not going to forget, leaving you wanting to watch it over again.",

Maverick is Luke Skywalker, the admirals are all Darth Vaders, and Maverick is the only person who has \"the Force\". Instead of traveling along a narrow channel on the Death Star, Luke (oops - Maverick) has to travel down a valley (Beggar's Canyon?) and surpisingly, has to put two bombs (not torpedoes this time) into an open about 2 meters wide. Does that sound familiar? He gets rescued by Han Solo now named \"Rooster\" and they have to escape from a nasty planet and are also chased by TIE Fighters now call 5th generation fighters. Overall, I am surpised that Disney and / or George Lucas has not sued someone over this Star Wars on Earth movie.  And I guess breaking several military laws / procedures is okay as long as you are Tom Cruise and there is no time in the brig or at least confined to quarters.\nSilly movie. It passed the time but Tom, it is time to hang it up. By the time you finished flight training, you were about 24. You have been flying for 30 years and so you are about 54. Most pilots are not flying combat missions at that age, at least not in F/A 18s. Go retire, or get command of a ship and sit down...",

It is so unbelievable that even at 59 he looks hell young as someone of 45 years, or even younger. His down to earth attitude with a smart personality is always a winning point.\n\nFor those who haven't watched 1986's masterpiece and original Top Gun, I strongly advise you to watch it, because it has emotional and eventual connection with this sequel. Val Kilmer's short yet impactful role of Admiral Iceman, now a sufferer of throat cancer, shares emotional bonding with Pete in a short period. Roles of young pilot trainees and graduates played by Miles Teller, Glenn Powell and Monica Barbaro are outstanding and performed exceptionally brilliant.\n\nLast but not the least, Jennifer Connelly deserves a strong applause for her performance as Pete's new love interest Penelope and a single mother. Her presence alongside Tom adds a slight comfort and helps in moving the story forward.\n\nOverall, this one is one of the greatest movie sequals Better than the original in everyway..A Pure masterpiece",

Then mix in the consequences of his past both good and bad and then give him a problem to overcome probably at great personal cost.\n\nThis is one of the few times, the sequel was as good if not better than the original which I have come to expect from Tom Cruze because he get it.

Now that might seem contradictory, and a tad unfair, but then by \u2018of its type' I mean a flick that doesn't add anything to the movie industry as a whole. In Top Gun \u2013 Maverick it's all been said, seen and done before and with much greater professionalism and panache. The script is poor, relying heavily upon clich\u00e9, the pacing is off (it takes 40 minutes for the movie to tell us that Cruise is going to teach new recruits) the acting is two dimensional (Hamm, hamming it up and Ed Harris trying, and failing, to re-invent the tough commander-type) and the rekindled love interest, totally unnecessary. Add to that the CGI and other effects that are below current gaming standards and a music score that dies with Lady Gaga's quite terrible out-tro and you have, in my opinion, a movie that should never have been made. Sure it's been a huge box office success, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a great movie. The original Top Gun was just that, original in so many ways; whereas this sequel offers nothing new and, in doing so, becomes a parody of itself.",

If you ask me and no one is, the minor roles were outstanding, and thank you so much for the close up of the \"shooter\" on the Carrier Deck. Some of us understand the spear is much more than the tip. \nAnyhoo, I was interested in the planes, and I was happy with what I got. The plot, the mythical bar on the beach surrounded by motorcycles, these are all fun. We HATE, HATE, do you hear me yet, when pilots are made so hysterical sounding, for acting reasons. You dropped the sexy instructor angle, thank you, how about the \"excited fighter pilot\" voice. That's a non sequitor. All of that. We could have just had music instead. Don't think anyone would have objected. Music to make your self calm while squeezed at high G's. There's a market there, I just know it. \nWe had to have the romance, so as to squeeze an ounce of turnip juice from the stone of the ageless female myth. Thank You Jennifer Connelly. \nWhat I liked about it was the ratio of shots of them talking in bed, compare to the time spent on shots of them having at it, or about to. It seemed about right. \n  Again, because all, and I mean all, the underpinnings were rock solid, the slimy \"Hollywood\" frosting was almost palatable this time around. Less gunk, more honest filling. And a good amount of what I wanted all along, carrier landings and take offs. YAY. I think it had a plot. Didn't you say it had a plot?

When she was 14 she was cast with David Bowie in the movie labyrinth. The actors got to spend almost 3 weeks with the navy on an aircraft Carrier training while getting launched from the carriers and landing on the carriers. This will probably never happen again. The beginning watching the dark star flight is absolute poetry in motion. I've never been in the military but I've watched this movie now 28 times!  The action sequences, the love stories, the acting from everyone involved is beautifully done. Only thing I wish that did not happen was Maverick asking ice if he wants to go up for 1 last ride and after a good time he dies with a smile on his face. ?  This is one of my top 5 favorite movies with avatar, Shawshank Redemption, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Ready Player 1 and Top Gun Maverick.

After you watch the movie for a while, the story will fade but the feel and the mode of the movie is what keeps you interacted. The soundtrack was nice and aircraft scenes were nicely shot. The movie at some times feel little bit long but the action sequences cover it all. This is movie which you may enjoy at cinema but not that at home. The action scenes are of next level when you experience it in cinema.\n\nOverall, you should give this movie a try especially those who love airforce.",

(3) how he disobeyed orders from his superiors on just too many unnecessary cases (4) Playing contact beach ball with everyone wearing ray bans (5) SPOILER how his mate was out of flares, and he flew back to sacrifice him to catch his bombs; that was very lame. \nI wanted to turn it off, but I kept watching due to the high rating it received on RT.

Every shot has the intentions to be the best shot possible for the movie. Tom Cruise always per usual delivers an outstanding performance as he reprise his role once more as Cptn Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell. The standout performance of the movie comes from Miles Teller stepping into his role as Rooster (Goose's son). Another outstanding performance that was captivating to see every time he popped on the screen came from Glen Powell (Hangman). His douchebag attitude yet cool guy persona made him annoying yet fascinating. The cinematography is phenomenal, the story isn't too complex, it's simple and straight to the point a man stepping up into the air fighting for the army once again, but obstacles make it a complicated journey of knowing the end is near for his time in the army doing the job he loves. The movie also moves at a pace that allows every story to have a part in the movie without one story being to overbearing. Overall the movie is a 10/10 for me.",

Joseph Kosinski perfectly delivered what Tony Scott envisioned for the sequel of the Top Gun series. This film set out to be a love letter to aviation, and it delivers with flying colors, kudos to everyone who has put all of their effort into making this movie and I hope it gets awards for its practical effects.",

Simply sit back and enjoy the ride, it's a fun one.\n\nThe movie of course stars Tom Cruise as Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, who's apparently still up his old jet fighter pilot antics that made him a star. It's clear his character is amazingly talented at what he does and the movie shows this off numerous times. The movie also has a nice cameo from Val Kilmer as Tom \"Iceman\" Krazinsky. It's a feel good moment to see him and Cruise on screen together.\n\nAside from the plot that drives the whole movie - a plot that seems almost like a suicide mission involving some unnamed enemies, the movie primarily focuses on Cruises relationship with Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller) who is the sun of Mavericks late rio and best friend, Nick \"goose\" Bradshaw. The movie feels like the action is real, its tons of fun with a fantastic story. See this movie on the big screen if you can, you won't be disappointed. \nhttp://themoviepad.com",

The filmography is second to none with angles that keeps you riveted to the screen. There are brief intervals in the film to let you catch your breath but the film seemed to fly by for me (I never glanced at my watch throughout the film). The only nagging item is that I never learned why the character of Bob had been assigned that call-sign but it is a mute point in a story that is a rip roaring good time.

Yeah, I get it - Tom Cruise is looking good, but for a 50-something to outfly aviators in their prime to become the mission leader felt very contrived (ego anyone?)...\n\nNevertheless - it was still enjoyable (like the first one) and built off the story trajectory in order to engage previous viewers as well as to delight younger audiences who seem to appreciate it (though it is hilarious that young audiences think it is so much better than the original - perhaps they are wowed by improved special effects due to tech advances).  For me, Top Gun is ultimately the better film because it was the origin story, with a more realistic storyline that had more depth and more relatable characters. Maverick did a good job of building on the relationships that the previous movie established, and the reframing of many of the same scenes was fun - it is still worth watching for sure.",

Yes, it's cheesy and silly and unashamedly over the top, no pun intended, but it's a damn fun movie that has stood the test of time purely because of its entertainment value. A day or 2 later I watched this much anticipated, and belated sequel, Top Gun: Maverick. I'd heard nothing but good things about it, and now it's my turn to join the choir in declaring it not just a great film, but that rarest of things: a sequel which surpasses the original. If you want a knockabout popcorn flick, the first one is the more appropriate choice. Maverick does exactly what a great sequel is supposed to do: take the original story and build on it. Things are more serious this time, as Maverick, our reckless hero, is forced to grapple with the demons of his past, and use all the skills he's accumulated to lead a new mission where his reputation, and his life, are on the line. I could probably tell you the names of all the new major characters, but with so many of them it's hard to recall all their personalities. But attention is always given where it matters, and its great to see an actor playing what is obviously the same character, but with a much greater deal of maturity and wisdom without losing their spirit, and that's exactly what Cruise manages to do. The ariel sequences, again done for real and not just on a computer, are as exciting as ever, and the film injects some real emotional weight into its story, so it's doesn't just feel like meaningless action fluff, there's real stakes and actual consequences. Characters are given realistic motivations, and petty arguments over stupid misunderstandings are thankfully absent. It's so refreshing to see a follow up that has real effort put into it, and not just a cynical cash grab, which it so easily could have been. It's one of 2022's best flicks, and unlike most sequels, it gives us a reason to be excited about future instalments. If that does happen, I'll be there in a flash.",

Heroes that make you smile, deep character driven conflict that doesn't come across soapy, snappy story that hits the right beats, great soundtrack and amazing production quality. This is my new absolute favourite movie. More movies need to get back to this standard. Cruise shows that he is still on his game and the new generation of actors brought in were incredibly solid. \n\nNatasha Trace's Phoenix is what Hollywood should be aiming for with strong female casts - she was an obvious equal to everyone else on screen, but never needed to belittle or rub anyones face in the fact she was a woman. Gorgeous, confident, skilled and tough. This is the kind of role model my daughter could look up to. \n\nMiles Teller did a fantastic job as Rooster. Enough physical similarity to pass as Anthony Edwards kid plus the performance incorporated obvious throwback to Edward's performance in Top Gun. Sure some was fan service-y (Do some of that pilot Sh*t Mav), but it wasn't over the top. Teller showed real emotion of someone who was dealing with his past loss being thrown in his face when he feels he is top of his game and the resolution of that emotional turmoil from both Rooster and Maverick by the film's conclusion left you feeling satisfied and happy as you walked out of the theatre.\n\nCan't not talk about the flying sequences. They were amazing and the shots made you feel like you were there in the action. The final battle gave audience actual tension and I personally was involuntarily chair flying alongside them. Unlike the original film, which I still pick apart the inconsistencies in the flying sequences (F-14 energy states are pretty easy to read with the wings and the combat shots were showpieces of aerobatics, not ACM), this one has so few that I could just enjoy it without thinking it was Hollywood trying to look fancy. It was engrossing, realistic (mostly) and visually stunning. The audio was absolutely spot on and seeing it in an Atmos enabled cinema is an absolute treat.\n\nIt may not be a cultural classic, but like I said at the top, this is my new favourite film.",

It was a very nostalgic homage to all of those things, including Kenny Loggins' signature single. It has very likeable characters, great action and amazing stunts that kept me on the edge of my seat at times. I also enjoyed seeing Jennifer Connolly (on whom I had a big crush back in the day). Having said all of that, the movie is a recycling of the original Top Gun and other 80s movies. The characters are clichd and the plot is fairly predictable. For this reason, I was rather bored during the movie's first half, the character-building portion of the story. The second half was more exciting when it explored some real risk and skill. Though, I have to say that the premise for the mission is taken straight right out of Star Wars: A New Hope. How the characters deal with the challenge is interesting, but this premise is another way the story isn't that unique.",

At no time did I get bored, the entertainment is first class. The story isn't going to win an Oscar, but the script is good, the action on screen is good, and the dogfights are incredible... I've never seen anything like it. It really was a delight that took me on a roller coaster of emotions with those brief flashbacks that take us back to the 80s when Top Gun was released. Totally recommended, I regret not having gone to see it at the cinema.",

The flight scenes were AWESOME!! The interactions between Maverick and the admirals were funny, predictable but definitely Maverick in character. Iceman was Phenomenal! I could have done without Jennifer Connelly but I understand why she was there. The dynamic between Rooster and Maverick ohhhh so weak. The dynamic between the other pilots left a lot to be desired. The team building football game. Come on now, why just why. We're different instead of volleyball we're going to play football. My three main disappointments, 1. Maverick didn't do his signature move. Especially after Rooster said, \"Do some of that pilot shit.\" Isn't he a pilot too! 2. Everything about Hangman (was he supposed to be a younger Iceman?) 3. You have to be launched off a carrier. You don't just take off and fly to the rescue against Admiral's orders. Who cleared the deck? Who heated up the catapult? Who launched the damn thing? There were moments in the movie that showed if it had been written to stand on its own how Great it could have been. Instead we got this formula thing with some great scenes.",

There are so many great storylines that could have emerged from 2986 TG but sadly they went with the least interesting and probable. Hero is still a hero, but now less compelling. Hero has a much younger romantic interest but there's no romance there. The \"mission\" stakes are undefined and the threat isn't immediate. The hero saves the day in the most unlikely way and the good guys lose nothing. \n\nThe jets are better, the actors are prettier but the soul of this movie is hollow. Everything that made the 1986 movie great (drama, romance, comedy, danger, consequence, originality, music) is missing from this one. It speaks volumes of how bad cinema has gotten that this dud of an action flick has been rated so highly.",

            "content": "\"Top Gun: Maverick\" was fantastic all I hoped it would be. It was evenly paced, IMPRESSIVELY photographed, had a good story line and hit all the \"high\" spots--paying tribute to the original very well. \n\nHowever, the IMAX theater where I viewed the movie (AMC IMAX, Springfield MO) has a completely inadequate sound system for rendering the audio portion of the supposedly \"immersive\" experience. The volume was too high this was evident in a most obvious way repeatedly in two types of scenes: \n\n1) whenever there was dialogue, it seemed like the actors were speaking at a volume high enough to be heard 'across a room' instead of face to face. The volume was so high there was no chance for tone or inflection to create an emphasis--like a whispering voice might imply something secretive or important--\"what\" whisper?? not in this theater. If this was done in order to alleviate closed captioning, it was an utter failure.\n\n2) in the action scenes, the volume was up so high distortion was complete and painfully annoying in the screeching rendition of whatever was showing on the screen--tires might screech during a high-speed chase but an approaching plane doesn't. Loudness is fine, and required in many movie scenes, but the accompanying high pitched scream should not be a screech of distortion--one that sounds almost like fingernails on a chalkboard--that's the sound of speakers mismatched with an amplifier being played too loud. Like AMC IMAX. Someone made the decision to spend less than required on the audio system and it's plainly apparent in the \"loudness\" at this theater. \n\nI've been on the deck directly beneath some of the Blue Angels stunt team when they pulled out of their dive. \"THUNDER\" doesn't begin to describe the immense volume and dB level that 4 jet engines put out. But they didn't screech like this theater's audio system, nor was it annoying nor painful to hear them like the rendering at AMC IMAX Springfield, MO.",

Thank you, Tom Cruise, for giving us such a movie in the 2020ies!\n\nA very good sequel, maybe even better than the first \"Top Gun\".",

It felt awkward and forced and, in my view, a little humiliating for Mr Kilmer.  In reality, the Navy could have just sent cruise missiles to do the job. But the producers knew seeing Star Wars in F-18s is more fun. The mission sequence and conclusion was totally lifted from that movie! That made the cockpit scenes, the best part of the movie, seem like something from a comic book. Who were we attacking anyway? A real crowd pleaser and recruiting tool. The high ratings here on Rotten Tomatoes are over inflated and undeserved in my opinion. 4G inverted eye roll for me.",

The message at the opening of the film by Tom Cruise was a nice touch. I felt like an appreciated customer. You make more movies like this and I will keep coming back!",

An honest, generous, and classy artisan blockbuster.\nI'm not going to dwell on this wonderful movie with just incredible effects. A Tom Cruise more beautiful and better than ever and releasing a movie with incredible actions and acting at its height, that is to say magnificent and all the other actors on the team were also great.",

I'm a huge military buff and am pretty familiar with how the military would handle things such as a missions, etc, and the storyline just seemed meh, it just didn't seem plausible....I know its just a movie and a made up story, but the military would never do a mission like that with F/A-18s. That would be a mission using B-2's. Honestly even the original Iron Eagle blows Top Gun: Maverick out the window. Pretty sure I'll never watch this one as many times as the original.

The beginning was extremely awesome with the music going back to the first one. But, the movie is self-serving and the lead actor which is Tom Cruise is extremely self-serving and egotastic. It could've been managed so much better. I feel that the movie was aiming for a younger crowd that has never seen the first movie to begin with. The attention span of younger viewers is not so great so I understand a bit why but if you're going to do a movie like top gun, do it so right and so amazing that it will go down in history like the first one. Bottom line, if it didn't start off so great it would be two stars. Tom Cruise needs to come down a couple of notches. I got a couple of veterans that would like to talk to him about this.",

            "content": "TopGun 2. For me, this is a story that I hoped would be revisited for a very long time. I cannot even count the amount of times I have watched the original. I can even say that for each time I watched it, I still got those great feelings and that tingle of enjoyment running down the spine. For me, it was not just the story, but also the music, that helped carry the story along in one of the most emmersive and exhilarating movies I have ever watched. \nSo, when it was announced that TopGun 2 was coming out - called TopGun Maverick, I couldn't wait for it to arrive. After watching it however, I found myself a little perplexed and underwhelmed. Although the movie was good and there was some amazing footage, CGI and action shots that made you feel you were right there with Maverick and the aircraft in the skies, I kept feeling that something was missing. \nThere were several things that has fell short of my expectations. TopGun was such an iconic movie, with some fun, excitment, love, honor, emotion and sadness, however there was always the backbone of reality and a noticable danger in flying jets and pushing it to the limit, that Joseph Kosinski and Tony Scott were able to capture on screen so well. This was of course highlighted by the loss of Goose. \nFor me, the new movie was too far removed from reality and leaning too much towards fiction and CGI, which I am sure would sit nicely for the younger audience, but not so much for those who were around when the original was released.  To begin the movie with a fictional aircraft that went to mach 10 or more was a stretch and a quick notification that this movie was going to very different from the original. Then, we had charactors that in my opinion were not strong enough to be in this type of movie. Not sure whether it was because they looked too young for the role, or Glen Powell's charactor, who loved himself far too much and bordering on just silly.  Then we have Tom. For me, Tom played a charactor that was far too close to Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible - rather than Lt. Pete Mitchell. Whether it was the little jokes or facial expressions, the charactor seemed an amalgamation of both of them - although too weighted towards Ethan.\nI know the ratings are very good for this movie and I do admit it was good and very action packed, however I guess I am more of the minority rather than the majority in this case. It took me a while to understand what my problem was with this movie and now I think I know why. It is the title that bothers me!\nIf this was a movie with Tom Cruise who has to train some pilots how to launch some missiles into a hole in the ground, then I am sure it would have been fine and could perhaps even be a mission impossible assignment. However, I do not think it should have been called TopGun Maverick, as I feel the movie is too far removed from the original. A few references here and there to Goose and a connection to his son, was for me, still too weak. There was next to no music at all, which again made the original so iconic, except for one song somewhere in the middle that I forgot about as soon as it finished. \nAs much as I love movies with Tom Cruise, this one seems a little lost and way below expectations. If you are going to have a title with TopGun in it, I would expect it to have a closer connection in the original. \nIt was good to see at least one of the original charactors made it back from the original. More would have been nice - especially at the funeral. A big tip of the hat to IceMan - Val Kilmer. I wish you well sir!",

            "content": "Like any laid back nester whose watch list plates were already full three months ago when the biggest aviator cinema phenomena was terrifically manifested by four worldwide generations of alpha action movie fans as the highest-grossing film of 2022, those young at heart now mostly in their fifties and beyond know it's better late than never to savour every adrenaline rush and thrill at their home theatre reimagined piloting inside the cockpit of a super hornet \u2014 Cher would sure want a ride with either or both Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer exclusively in the name of her boyfriendology.\n\nIt is easy to settle with Top Gun Maverick if you are a sucker for airborne speeds, navy blues, military friendships and undying bonds plus a little drama of cockfights under the eighties vibe. Like its 1984's predecessor, Jerry Bruckheimer teamed up with the fellow lead cast and co-producer Cruise and director Tony Scott (who'd unfortunately passed away in the early production year) to restore the original bohemian, freewheeling soul of the eponymous character \"Maverick\" with decades of preceding reputation as a steadfast fighter aircraft diehard now summoned to perfect the hard skills of a budding team of special tasked pilots. Haunted by losing his late bestie, his training mate \"Goose\"/dad of trainee \"Rooster\" (a strikingly identical Miles Teller as the son of a 36-years younger Anthony Edwards) in the previous accident, \"Maverick\" went against the trial rules and pushed high risk altitude flying to make sure the team know how to make their way back in crisis.\n\nFans can tell Cruise is physically on par resuming his ageless role, despite tucking away his small belly in two shirtless scenes, but genuinely not shortsighted and qualified still as an aviator. To counter his immortal charm at the best going rate, an equally dateless Jennifer Connelly starred as his interest of heart. Both Ed Harris and Jon Hamm stood out in their uniformed character; the kicking top gun graduates are added with a black-lives-matter conscious and, whether that really matters for any subtext observation, the co-ed team's beach valleyball game scene deliberately recreated and reprised as a famous homoerotic moment in the tradition of the duology films.\n\nAnd once again just for the fans, new director Joseph Kosinski worked out the Sonantic-enhanced voice of the post cancerous Kilmer and gave his character \"Iceman\" a much respectful departure.\n\nThe only disappointment is the totally inappropriate, unnecessary and embarrassing closure soundtrack, I mean, why involved Lady Gaga?!! Her music even as to date is far too incomparable to Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock's \"Take My Breath Away\" performed by Berlin.\n\nProduced by Skydance Media and Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer, this high-octane sequel to one of the eighties' most memorable movies was first distributed by Paramount Pictures states-wide and available in IMAX, 4DX, ScreenX and Dolby Cinema experience.",

But for this time it was just as it should be. I saw TOP GUN 100's of times and could almost every line in that movie. I predict I'll see this movie too, maybe not 100's of times, very close.\nThe start was just amazing, the intro song spot on. This must be the one movie that is true  to it's predecessor.

I took half a star off because it isn't quite original as it follows the same format as the first one. And while it worked, this didn't really add more outside the formula of the first movie. However the movie was just great. Truly a wild ride and the stakes truly felt raised among the cast. Watching them feel the G forces was hilarious and awesome and added to the true terror of what pilots go thru daily. \n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",

The Force Awakens \"feels\" like the original \"A New Hope\" Episode IV (1st released).  Top Gun Maverick \"feels\" like the original Top Gun.  Much like the Star Wars comparison, Top Gun Maverick borrows many of the plot points from the original (but in a good way).   Well done !

            "content": "\"Top Gun: Maverick\" is an exhilarating film with no pretensions.  It just wants to be a first-rate diversion on a hot, humid summer afternoon.  By that measure, it exceeds expectations.  If you're looking for an existential assessment of the human condition, go see \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\"  If you want to examine the nature and texture of relationships, check out \"Brian and Charles\" or \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.\"  \"Maverick\" is an unapologetic adrenaline rush that doesn't have time to probe the darker corners of the human psyche.  So just sit back and savor Tom Cruise reprising his most iconic role.\nThis film works for three reasons: its visuals, its tone and what happens when there aren't jets in the air.  Visually, \"Maverick\" is simply spectacular.  The dogfights and other aerial shots are all real, not CGI.  When you see the g-forces pressing on Tom Cruise's face, that's real.  This commitment to reality makes these action scenes even more riveting.\nThe tone of the film is equally skilled.  It's self-referential without being self-absorbed.  There's a bar where there are renditions of \"Great Balls of Fire.\"  There is beach football substituting for beach volleyball.  The admiral's daughter (referenced in the original but never seen) shows up.  Most of all, there's an appearance by Val Kilmer, who played fighter pilot \"Iceman\" in the original.  Here, he's an admiral whose body is failing because of cancer.  He can speak only with great effort.  (In real life, Kilmer has battled throat cancer.  His brief speaking parts in \"Maverick\" are computer-generated.)\nFinally, in \"Maverick\" the story keeps its footing even when it's on the ground.  The original film was littered with excruciating dialogue filled with tortured clich\u00e9s (\"Your ego is writing checks your body can't cash.\").  And because of Director Tony Scott's advertising background, \"Top Gun\" featured way too many locker room scenes that just looked like product placement for Jockey briefs. By comparison, \"Maverick\" offers a cornucopia of interesting tidbits.  There's a height-appropriate love interest for Cruise. (Jennifer Connelly is excellent.)  There's also a surrogate father-son dynamic between Maverick and Goose's son.  As a special bonus, Maverick appears incrementally more self-aware.  There's even a female fighter pilot vying to become the gender-neutral alpha dog.\nThe plot is almost an afterthought.  After taking an experimental aircraft to Mach 10 in an opening scene, Maverick is assigned back to Top Gun School to train pilots for a suicide mission.  An unidentified rogue nation is engaging in uranium enrichment.  Maverick has to train pilots who will blow up the enrichment plant before this country can develop nuclear capability that will threaten civilization.  And so on.\nA storyline that can be charitably described as \"implausible\" in no way detracts from the fun of this film.  In one of the three (count \u2018em, three) climactic scenes, Maverick and his team attack the rogue nation, a country with plentiful evergreen trees and snow on the ground.  The uranium enrichment facility is three minutes from the coast.  Go to the biggest screen you can find to watch Tom Cruise bomb Norway.",

It is, after all, an American action movie with a rogue/loner hero who breaks all the rules, all the time. Maybe a tad predictable at times, and certainly some plot holes (even some of the same flaws that plagued the first movie), but exciting, gripping, and tons of fun from beginning to end.

Loved the Nostalgia of it wasn't too much wasn't too little. Obviously the movie is about Maverick but would also liked to have seen more of a passing of the torch and not to make it so much about Tom Cruise but the actual Characters. there were aspects of the 80's still in here which part of me liked more than expected. over all a should see just so you know this body of work.",

Ultimately this was an impossibility a sequel 30 years after the original is crazier than the average Fast and the Furious Plot but despite all of the hurdles and crazy expectations this just worked on so many levels it's still amazing that they made this whole thing work.\n\nI thought the casting was right on point they all obviously really enjoyed the experience other than Myles Teller who frankly looked like he barely read the script most of the time. I mean seriously he's such an influential figure yet talk about a lack of investment emotionally or personally he was shown up by literally almost everyone else in the Cast even Bob!\n\nSo 1.4 Billion who would of thought and the number one Movie of the Year not bad Tom Cruise can't wait till the Sequel.",

And no movie in recent years has been able to pull it off quite like Top Gun: Maverick. It was very character driven. It was almost like Tom Cruise had never left the role of Maverick after all these years. Everyone else was fantastic. Miles Teller was so believable as the son of Goose. His screen presence is mesmerising. He is going places. Overall, this was a shockingly fantastic and feel-good action extravaganza. Well worth your money.",

They didn't have to artificially create a situation to give the character an arc, the arc was already in place by the end of the first film. This is what makes this and a show like Cobra Kai stand out from all the many other resurrected franchises (Even Ghostbusters Afterlife, which other than that I thoroughly enjoyed), it felt like a story that needed to be told. \n\nThe movie is also a reminder of the value of actual stunts and physical effects.

The storyline is completely predictable, the dialogue at times corny but you're not there for a deep dive into character development. You're there for the flying sequences and dog fights between the good and bad guys. And, for that it delivers very well. Tom Cruise knows how to deliver excitement on the silver screen and in this one, he delivers big. The tribute to Val Kilmer gets a big thumbs up and his appearance in a one on one scene with Cruise is poignant and memorable. The two hour, 11 minute run time flew by in a flash so this is easily worth a summer night out.",

I cannot describe the feeling of excitement I got when the Hans Zimmer's beautiful \"Top Gun Anthem\" started playing at the beginning and the same title card explaining why the Top Gun Flight Academy was established was shown. Following that, they didn't mess with the opening credits. They kept it the exact same with the shots of the F-18s taking off from the carrier with Kenny Loggins' \"Danger Zone\" blasting in the background. Every scene in this movie, every line of dialogue feels completely necessary and fully adds to the movie. The final battle sequence of this movie has also instantly become one of the best of all time. I  really had to get up and pee by the end of this, but when Maverick and Rooster got the F-14 off the ground and I was like, \"Nope, I think I can hold it.\" Easy 10/10",

This movie shows men and women of the Navy, tales it to another level. It honors the relationships from the first movie, great script. The music is amazing and the tracks from the original movie take me back to the sounds of the 80s. It shows strong men and women with backbones, and lots of muscle, so refreshing. I also appreciated seeing mature adults with wrinkles. You're told at the beginning that they wanted the audience to have an immersive experience and they did not disappoint. Tom Cruise is a good actor and the look of pure joy on his face when he rode his motorcycle or when he was flying felt genuine. His Mission Impossible movies are amazing and there was a MP vibe that I thoroughly enjoyed. Maverick is fearless, so awesome to experience that. To have an impossible goal and to accomplish it, what a thrill. And yes, I would see it again!",

To say I was pleasantly surprised is a massive understatement! The whole movie was entertaining from start to finish and not once did it lose my attention! I would gladly go see Maverick again!",

            "content": "Over thirty years after graduating from TOPGUN, United States Navy Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is a test pilot. While he has won many honors, repeated insubordination has kept him from flag rank , with his friend and former TOPGUN rival Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet who often protects Maverick from being grounded. Rear Admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain cancels Maverick's \"Darkstar\" scramjet program in favor of funding drones. Before he can officially do so, Maverick sets a new flight plan to push into high-hypersonic speed, accomplishing the program's goal. The prototype is destroyed, however, when he pushes beyond Mach 10. Iceman saves Maverick's career once again by ordering him to NAS North Island for his next assignment, but Hammer warns Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircraft will soon end. The Navy has been tasked with destroying an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant, which sits in a deep depression at the end of a canyon. It is defended by SA-3 Goa surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and what appear to be fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57[d] fighters. Maverick devises a plan to attack with two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. Although he wants to fly the mission, Maverick is instead asked to train an elite group of TOPGUN graduates assembled by air boss Vice Admiral Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson, who dislikes Maverick's unorthodox methods. Maverick out-dogfights his skeptical students to push them to their limits and to win their respect. Lieutenants Jake \"Hangman\" Seresin and Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw (Miles Teller)\u2014 son of Maverick's late best friend and RIO Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw\u2014clash; Rooster dislikes Hangman's cavalier attitude, while Hangman criticizes Rooster's cautious flying. Maverick reunites with former girlfriend Penny Benjamin, to whom he reveals that Rooster's mother made him promise before she died that Rooster would not become a pilot. Rooster, unaware of the promise, resents Maverick for impeding his military career and blames him for his father's death. Maverick is reluctant to further interfere with Rooster's career, but the alternative is to allow him to fly in the extremely dangerous mission. He relays his doubts to Iceman who has throat cancer; before dying, Iceman advises that \"It's time to let go\" and reassures him that \"the Navy needs Maverick\"...\n\nRotten Tomatoes consensus reads, \"Top Gun: Maverick pulls off a feat even trickier than a 4G inverted dive, delivering a long-belated sequel that surpasses its predecessor in wildly entertaining style.\" Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood called the sequel better than the original movie. The New York Times-based critic A. O. Scott called it a \"thin, over-strenuous and sometimes very enjoyable movie\" and \"an earnest statement of the thesis that movies can and should be great\". Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian: \"Cruise presides over some surprising differences from his first outing as the navy pilot hotshot in a film that's missing the homoerotic tensions of the 80s original\". Alonso Duralde of TheWrap called the movie \"another cornball male weepie and military recruitment ad that feels like every WWII movie got fed into an algorithm\", and wrote that the movie \"counts as a worthy sequel in that it succeeds and fails in many of the same ways as the original\" and added that \"the flying sequences are breathtaking enough to make you forget that these guys and gals are engaging in the kind of combat scenarios that start wars.\" Entertainment.ie's Brian Lloyd's 4-star review said the film \"exceeds with flying colours\" and \"exists in a world that is all of its own making. There are golden sunsets, perfectly crisp white t-shirts, exquisitely coiffed hair, and long-held flames of romance that make it all impossible to resist.\" Clarrise Loughery, chief editor of The Independent, wrote that the film is \"as thrilling as blockbusters get. It's the kind of edge-of-your-seat, fist-pumping spectacular that can unite an entire room full of strangers sitting in the dark and leave them with a wistful tear in their eye.\" Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote, \"The new film, less of a sequel than a renovation, infuses the 1986 drama of airborne combat with today's politics.\" Tomris Larfy of RogerEbert.com wrote, \"Equally worthy of that big screen is the emotional strokes of Maverick that pack an unexpected punch.\" Tatsam Mukherjee of Firstpost wrote that the film reminded him of James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari (2019), and commended the coordination between \"man and machine\". He added, \"At the forefront of this clash is a man named Tom Cruise, who wants nothing less than our jaws on the floor. Proving that no amount of multiverse films or superstar cameos will replace the blood, sweat and adrenaline of an actor legitimately trying to push the boundaries of filmmaking. We can be rest assured that if it's a Tom Cruise film, he will not let us down.\" Chris Bumbray of JoBlo.com called the film as \"a thrill ride of the highest order\" and wrote, \"If you're a fan of the original, this will blow you away \u2013 but even if you don't love the 1986 classic (blasphemy), this has a lot to offer.\" (via Wikipedia)\n\nThis sequel to the 1986 film \"Top Gun\" offers a thrilling airborne ride showing off flying effects that is miles away from the more wobbly effects in the first film. The storyline is as thin as paper (what would you expect and yet three people wrote this script...) and the enemy is now \"unknown\" yet it\u00b4s quite clear Russia is the \"unknown enemy\" which is a bit silly to be honest. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" prosper in nostalgia of course and that is ok, but too much is a repetition of what we saw in \"Top Gun\" and the only thing that really stands out is the amazing flying sequences not much else in my book. Tom Cruise is solid as Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, while I think the great Jennifer Connelly ends up too much in the background. It\u00b4s nice to see that Val Kilmer got to reprise his Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky role and his real life struggle with throat cancer becomes a part of the storyline. And I think Miles Teller does a good job as Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw. I have seen so many 5 out of 5 reviews and I can\u00b4t honestly agree to that. This is nothing more than a 3 and a half to me. \n\nTrivia: It has grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022, the second film released during the COVID-19 pandemic to gross $1 billion, and the highest-grossing film of Cruise's career.",

So the great thing, the mass appeal, is there are no gray lines, no politics: everyone understands who is Good, who isn't.  Cruise looks amazing as does everyone else. There's a great, heartfelt subplot. The jets are real. There is at least an hour of up-in-the-sky thrills and chills. Oscars? Seems to me the sound editing  and cinematography and soundtrack and Lady Gaga's great closing number, \"Hold My Hand\", are locks  It's time for Cruise to win his acting Oscar, (a career award), as he should have won for \"Born on the 4th of July\" anyway. My only quibble is that \"Maverick\" pretty much marches  lock-step with the original, but is so much better.  This is the perfect summer thrill ride best seen on a huge screen, and the experience is upped if you can find this on IMAX. Or on one of the new massive tilted screens: the jets are right over your head for a great movie experience. I'm going again this Friday, 8/12/22",

You get the intense flying scenes which we all loved in the first movie. Story line was better than the first due the drama of Maverick and Goose's son in this movie. \nFantastic movie would watch multiple times at the movies and did. \nMaybe best movie of the first Half of 2022?",

This sequel ties up Pete's life, the loss of his fried \"Goose\" and interaction with Goose's son 'Rooster' and brings back and pays tribute to Iceman in a very heartfelt and bro 'guy' way. Jennifer Connelly is THE perfect love interest for Maverick. Sure there are some moments you have to suspend your disbelief, but now-a-days what movie doesn't.

The character development and interpersonal conflicts were of the type similar to what you might have experienced in your own life.  The most important positive aspect of this movie that I liked is that I could actually understand the spoken dialogue.  So many movie dialogue in other movies is almost unintelligible, garbled, or whispered such that half the time, you cant even understand what is being said.

The plot is really great, making the audience's heart beat faster as the mission progresses, and they won't spend too much time in a personal relationship (in a romantic way). I personally think Rooster and Phoenix are good matches for \ud83e\udd23. I've been to the cinema to watch this movie more than eight times. I still love this movie so much. awesome movie!

They are now O-6s (Navy Captains and Marine Colonels) themselves.

It's like making Rambo 2 using flyweight boxers. When I see Hornets I also think of films where they have featured like Independence Day. What about a nice F35 Lightening instead ?

Like Stilton. \n\nMinus the swearing I'd say this is a great film ... for 6 year old boys. \n\nIt's got planes, it's got fast cars, it's got dad issues throughout and it even has the odd boat thrown in - for what reason I still can't quite figure out. I'm sure the lads in the audience will be grateful though.\n\nI don't know why they couldn't market this to a younger audience to be honest, it would have been absolutely perfect. There's plenty of cheesy characters delivering typical one-liners who seem to live in a military/pilot town where nothing really ever happens other than going into work and getting drunk. Everyone knows each other etc. \n\nThe plot line is simple, so simple that there really isn't much going on and I'd advise you to leave your brain at home. Otherwise you'll be guessing (correctly) what's about to take place next, and well, where's the fun in watching a film where you already know what's going to happen?\n\nLet's just say it's simplistic to the point that I was slightly confused how the film producers managed to get away with it. Films are largely a lot more complex nowadays, even children's films have sophisticated story lines that keep audiences enthralled and guessing what will happen next. This film is pretty much a 2 minute story line dragged out into a 2 hour film. Its got some cool film shots of planes flying really high in the sky though. And I'm grateful on this occasion the 'enemy' is a faceless, placeless generic naughty nation, which doesn't play upon ingrained racist stereotypes. I'm also grateful that there's a simple and sweet love interest story featuring an 'older' couple ... That gave the film a slight degree of depth, but then this also precludes it from being shown to my 6 year old boy as it's a little risqu\u00e9 for super young audiences ... So I'm torn as I know he would love to see the rest of the film!",

Same story as aaaaaalways. When Tom appears before the movie, doing an intro and explaining that the movie took 15 years in the making, one naturally expects something different and better, but the only thing better were the flight scenes, which nowadays anyone can find even in any decent video game.

I had waited 5 weeks to finally encounter an empty hall, which I did, with only 2 more persons, 2 days before the movie would disappear from the town and I am happy to have seen it on the big screen, but I am sure that I won't watch it again once it'll appear on cable TV in a few weeks. It's cool, but principally the same stuff you have seen in dozens or hundreds of movies before.",

And Maverick proved that the pilot was still best, and the film reminded him of what the theater was worth.",

What's with the Tom Cruise address to the audience before the film?  Does he really have to endorse his own movie ant that we are going to like the movie?\n\nIt's good to see the forbidden flag is in the western release.

It's well written and stays faithful to the original in regards to honoring the original story and cast.\n\nIt play perfect homage to the original movie without just being a movie that relies on nostalia. If you are a child of the 80s and saw the original back then, the movie will definitely have a bigger impact on you, but it's not required. The movie stands on it's own.\n\nSome people did not like the romance that was involved since it felt forced..but I had no issue with it. Since 30 years have past, throwing in something that would link to something that happened during that time was not a problem for me - even though we didn't know those characters...it still worked out fine for me.\n\nThe visuals and camera work are also superb in this movie. Exciting, intense and beautiful.\n\nLove this movie - cannot wait to watch it again as soon as it starts streaming. \n\nHighly recommend.",

When my wife asked my daughter why she likes the movie so much, my 7 year old said 1) It was her favorite movie ever, 2) she loves the music, 3) and she likes the leather chairs and air conditioning in the movie theater. Couldn't have said it better myself. Personally, I've seen Top Gun Maverick 27 times and still going! The visits just kind of piled up without thinking about it... Kind of like going back to ride a roller coaster at the amusement park over and over again. Multiple times with various friends and family. Just kept going back for more. It's a very addictive movie. A total masterpiece... It's still my favorite movie ever. I still get choked up at the same spots in the movie after the 27th time! The only time I have seen a movie even twice in the movie theater was Matrix 1 in 1999. So it's been awhile. Top Gun Maverick is also now my favorite soundtrack of all time as well. Just trying to enjoy it as much as possible before it leaves the big screen. I cannot imagine watching it on a small ipad screen in mono sound. That would be an insult. I still get awed by the level of inspiration it provides, totally uplifting.. It really comes down to... would you see an absolute masterpiece by somebody at the top of their game (Tom Cruise) over and over again, picking up little distinctions each time, in total awe? or go watch that re-cycled green screen crap once? For example, Cruise is continuing to evolve his live action chase sequences with elements from the Mission Impossible Fallout helicopter chase scene at various flight sequences of Top Gun Maverick. Simply awesome. At this pace, Top Gun Maverick has a chance of cracking the top ten best selling movies of all time worldwide. Let's see how it holds up from here. There's a reason why rotten tomatoes critics gave Top Gun Maverick 97, and the general audience gave it a 99. Getting people to agree on anything these days is like herding cats. I truly feel bad for people that miss this experience in the theaters. Hopefully enough people go see this movie so that it makes a loud statement to the big movie companies and they switch us out of this wokeness trend into a new more normal one!! Keep flying higher Top Gun Maverick!!! Number 19 worldwide and climbing!!!!",

When my wife asked my daughter why she likes the movie so much, my 7 year old said 1) It was her favorite movie ever, 2) she loves the music, 3) and she likes the leather chairs and air conditioning in the movie theater. Couldn't have said it better myself. Personally, I've seen Top Gun Maverick 27 times and still going! The visits just kind of piled up without thinking about it... Kind of like going back to ride a roller coaster at the amusement park over and over again. Multiple times with various friends and family. Just kept going back for more. It's a very addictive movie. A total masterpiece... It's still my favorite movie ever. I still get choked up at the same spots in the movie after the 27th time! The only time I have seen a movie even twice in the movie theater was Matrix 1 in 1999. So it's been awhile. Top Gun Maverick is also now my favorite soundtrack of all time as well. Just trying to enjoy it as much as possible before it leaves the big screen. I cannot imagine watching it on a small ipad screen in mono sound. That would be an insult. I still get awed by the level of inspiration it provides, totally uplifting.. It really comes down to... would you see an absolute masterpiece by somebody at the top of their game (Tom Cruise) over and over again, picking up little distinctions each time, in total awe? or go watch that re-cycled green screen crap once? For example, Cruise is continuing to evolve elements from the Mission Impossible Fallout helicopter chase scene at various flight sequences of Top Gun Maverick. Simply awesome. At this pace, Top Gun Maverick has a chance of cracking the top ten best selling movies of all time worldwide. Let's see how it holds up from here. There's a reason why rotten tomatoes critics gave Top Gun Maverick 97, and the general audience gave it a 99. Getting people to agree on anything these days is like herding cats. I truly feel bad for people that miss this experience in the theaters.",

            "content": "I remember when Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) was released, and despite my lack of interest in the whole series, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Part of the reason for this was the fact that it was essentially a retreading of the original Star Wars film, A New Hope (1977), which is probably my favourite of the franchise, and it was done very well. Top Gun: Maverick is similar in the sense that it follows the original 1986 film (which is not a great film, but it's certainly a cult classic with plenty to enjoy in it) almost beat for beat; you can probably guess most of the plot from the first sequence onwards. It is a straight sequel though, Tom Cruise's Maverick is sent back to Top Gun to train the \u2018best of the best' to undertake a potentially suicidal mission to blow up a uranium enrichment plant in a plan that supposedly requires not one but two miracles to be successful. The film isn't subtle, much like the original, it's laugh out loud funny at times and Maverick hasn't changed his approach to life or authority. The thing is however, is that Top Gun: Maverick is absolutely fantastic cinema. Especially if you're a fan of the original, you'll (subjectively) be gripped from minute one. The fact that Tom Cruise is sixty this year adds to the astonishment that a sequel not far off forty years in the making is this good. The actions sequences are jaw dropping, the actors (old and new) embellish the spirit of the Top Gun world, and, possibly most effectively, the emotional heft of the film is superbly judged, making several sequences (including one with a returning Val Kilmer) genuinely difficult to get through without really feeling it. There was a round of applause towards the end of the film in the screening I was at, as well as several whoops; something I would usually turn my nose up at, but I couldn't do anything but completely get on board with the reaction. What an absolute blast.",

The end was very good and so I left the theater satisfied, but this was not the great movie that everyone claimed.  \n\nThe best scene was between Cruise and Val Kilmer. The old players brought their skills to the screen as always. \n\nBut Tom Cruise did not have chemistry with the new people in the cast .The leading lady especially had no  spark with Tom and it was almost as if he had no romantic storyline because there was no heat or connection between them, which contrasted so much with all the fire he had with Kelly McGillis in the first film.\n\n I missed the flirtation and sex appeal of the first film because this one had none. So that part of Maverick's personality was muted.  The scenes of the female lead throwing Maverick  out of the bar and treating him badly in the bar came off mean, not flirty or fun. It's amazing how this character's flritations were so empty and cold. \n\nAlso, Cruise had no chemistry with MIles Teller, who was the wrong cast for Goose's son. Teller was not likeable and someone else could have given the character more sympathy and fun. The \"fun\" scenes with Teller it didn't translate because his energy isn't fun. And the fight on screen was ridiculous writing because someone mentioning Maverick killed your father would be no reason to fight. . \n\nThe supporting cast lacked pinache period. In the first movie from the 80s everyone was cool, full of personality, and easy on screen --- as 80s actors were apt to be. This younger crew  of Top Gun graduates in the Maverick film were artificial on screen. And the female one came off harsh and robotic. They tried too hard and the acting was noticeably contrived. None of their scenes will ever be memorable or quoted like the ones in the first film. \n\nThe callbacks to the original movie were too paint-by-the-numbers to be touching, entertaining or nostalgic. It's both the fault of the writers and the director. \n\nThe director was too obvious in his touches in many ways, such as how he zoomed in repeatedly on characters glancing at each other in a moment of concern or doom, which became comical. These zooms  with the unnecessary commentary from cast underscored things too much and lacked subtlety. \n\nI've seen the original Top Gun film over 50 times and know lines by heart. This Maverick version I never want to see again.",

The stunts and flight scenes are incredible, especially when you see this on a big screen in a theatre. Also the fact that there is almost no CGI and shots were actually taken during flight, makes this all the more special. Big shout out to Tom Cruise and his team for making this fantastic movie (I hope Hollywood learns from this and makes more of these kinds of movies). I think most of the other reviews mentioned all the good parts. If there is one movie you have to see this year, go to Top Gun Maverick!",

It is definitely a must watch for all fans of the original, and for anyone else who loves the excitement of cinema. The movie isn't perfect and has its fair share of tacky Americanized romance, but even though it can be cringe at times, it does not effect the otherwise brilliant plot. So be ready to sit on the edge of your seat and experience a beautifully shot, wild ride of joy, heartache, and downright electric thrill.\n\n*spoiler* review\n\nThe montage that kicks off the film definitely sets it up to be a marvel in cinematography - when it comes to fighter jets that is. The scenes where characters are flying are immersive and stunning to look at, not to mention very fun, and every last one of them left me on the edge of my seat wanting more. Even throughout the rest of the movie good camera techniques and strong depth of fields are used on faces to really single out characters and let the audience analyze them, a useful technique for the plot where the audience is trying to decide their positions on the individual pilots. \nThe plot itself was very good, and the situation set up between Maverick and Rooster was a perfect link to the last film and a strong narrative, performed brilliantly by Tom and Miles. Right from the get go I was enthralled and captivated by the story they had set up with the mission, and even though it was quite predictable that they would succeed and probably all survive, the stakes felt so high that it was still extremely  entertaining to watch play out. Certain scenes left my heart beating out of my chest with fear!\nThe plot falls however when it comes to the side romance story. If the movie has a big problem it's this for me. The romance felt forced, extremely cringe and tacky, and unbelievable predictable. Cool guy meets girl he used to date, they are both single, he can't mess it up this time, and they are in love. What happens? Oh they get together at the end, kiss while leaning against a Porsche, and literally fly into the sunset lol. However even though it was a generic and predictable side story, the rest of the movie was so entertaining that honestly I didn't mind it too much, and it fits in with the genre, but I would have liked to see a change there and was disappointed. \nLast few notes are that I was very impressed with all the diverse cast of actors, and thought they did a brilliant job!\nI also really loved how after making that one enemy jet extremely hard to kill due to a skilled enemy pilot, when their plane was eventually shot down they ejected, not going to lie after they pulled that missile evasion I was rooting for them haha.\nAnd that's it for my review on Top Gun: Maverick! I would give it a solid 93%",

This one, Maverick, will definitely be in my DVD collection and after watching it this weekend in the theater, I may go watch it again in the theater. After the first 15 minutes, this movie is a rollercoaster ride with edge-of-your-seat thrills. In the 36 hours since I saw the movie, I continue to re-run it in my head. This one is so much better than the original, even with Tom Cruise in his late 50s when he made the movie - he's 60 now. I'm a few years older than him and I did not want to see an old  Tom Cruise in a Topgun movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Go see it. You will love it.",

My favorite movie ever. My favorite soundtrack of all time. Trying to enjoy it as much as possible before it leaves the big screen. I cannot imagine watching it on a small ipad screen in mono sound. That would be an insult. Saw it for the 25th time yesterday and I still get awed by the level of inspiration it provides, totally uplifting.. It really comes down to... would you see an absolute masterpiece over and over again, picking up little distinctions each time, in total awe? or go watch that re-cycled green screen crap once? There's a reason why rotten tomatoes critics gave Top Gun Maverick 97, and the general audience gave it a 99.  I truly feel bad for people that miss this experience in the theaters.",

For me, this sequel was better than the original! With Tom Cruise's Maverick now older, wiser, and humbled by life's ups and downs, this deepened the storyline and feeling of the film. I was moved to tears multiple times during this movie! Say what you will about Tom Cruise in real life - what they also say is true - he is one of the last great and true movie stars. Watching him on the big screen is both exhilarating, moving and astounding. He is really a magnetic presence. This film blew it out of the water! Fantastic! Would definitely see again.",

The action is great. The suspense is slightly undercut by clich\u00e9s and predictability, but all in all this is a great movie and deserves to be the #1 film of 2022 so far (in my opinion), if it can accomplish it.",

Look, I like Tom Cruise movies, and will suspend belief for every Mission Impossible action scene, but this movie?-meh. Maybe because I am an ex-sailor from San Diego who works in government programs now, every silly thing made me roll my eyes. 1) Two star admirals don't just up and cancel billion dollar Lockheed flight programs.  McCain was a senior senator, and even he couldn't cancel the crappy LCS program.  Way too many people, politics and 4 star Admirals involved.  2)  After 3 years away as a test pilot, you don't get to just jump in an F-18 cockpit - you have to requalify and recertify.  3)  \"The Best of the Best\" fly F-35s now (but the Navy let the movie makers use F-18's, so you work with what you got).  4) I'd believe a kid could get bit by a spider and get powers before I believed in a single mom, dive bar owner with a $90K vintage 911, a $220K sailboat and a $6 million house on the water in Ocean Beach.  And super-hot and single, to boot.  Don't want any silly real-life relationship issues to get in Maverick's way.  5) Iceman gets buried in Rosecrans National Cemetery, which has been full for decades - you can still get an urn with your ashes placed there, but no more caskets.  6) An F-14 defeating not one, but 3 next generation fighters, supposedly SU-57s would be like a '68 Camaro winning a formula 1 race. Can't happen, no matter who the pilot is.  Maverick would have a better chance in his P-51 beating 3 F-18s.  \nJust little nitpicks but they bother me and seems they didn't even try to be realistic.  I liked the Mission Impossible trailer and will wait for that.",

The incredible 4D dives and amazing flight sequences are intense and shot in such thrilling fashion.

It's pretty easy to do that since Tom Cruise sleeps in an alien healing pod and is only 40 in human years. The story line is familiar. Maverick has to fly at high speed through a heavily defended enemy cavern, while avoiding missile turrets to drop some bombs down an exhaust port only two meters wide. It may seem impossible, but Maverick used to bullseye womp rats in his F-16 back home.  Maverick destroys the enemy base, gets the girl, and gains the respect of his colleagues. The End.",

Top Gun: Maverick has already firmly cemented itself as a classic that will endure and be remembered for decades to come, all by making a movie that blends old-school sensibilities with new-school technology to create the perfect summer blockbuster; that is to say a movie that not only has heart-pounding action and spectacle, but a good, heartfelt story that makes you care about what happens to the characters throughout said action.  All this is to say that Top Gun: Maverick encapsulates everything I love about going to the movies, and it's what all movies of its kind should strive to be.",

And it's complete with: a girl in a Porsche at Sunset, smart ass dialogue in a bar, \"evil\" countries, and on and on. This is the kind of movie that later on South Park will use for their next World Police sequel.\n\nAnd like I said, the selling point of this movie so far has been the fact that Tom Cruise pilot its own airplanes, as if a movie would have to be real.\nSo I assume, if we make a sci-fi movie about going into the black hole, Tom Cruise will go into the black hole himself. \n\nWhich in reality would not be a bad idea, since on this way we would be free from any remakes of Top Gun ever again.",

All of the action scenes are spectacular to look at mainly because they were done practically, very little to no CGI can be found in this spectacle. Tom Cruise fits right back in the role of Maverick like a glove and gives a powerful and emotional performance along with that, Miles Teller is also very brilliant as Goose's son Rooster, and many of the other casts members give both humorous and reputable performances as well. This is a sequel that would make Tony Scott proud. If you are a fan of the original or just love action films, this is definitely worth seeing, especially on the big screen, you need a good sound system to fully appreciate this movie !",

The story was not too complex, and yet it was deeply moving and inspiring. The flight scenes were out of this world and you truly feel like you're in the plane with the pilots flying them.

The movie combines great dialogue, storyline, and action into one great film. The connection between Goose and Rooster in the movie is out of this world. And the storyline provides so much connection between both films and constantly has you engaged in the plot. There is so much action in the film that you never get bored. The storyline makes this film, but the dialogue, action, and soundtrack add so much more. This film is an absolute masterpiece, and it will have you emotionally invested from start to finish.

They absolute get the Tone right which every sequel/remake movie these days gets wrong (ie Halloween, Star Wars). I can't give it 4 or 5 stars though because it's the little things that this movie gets wrong that take away from the movie's effectiveness. It deviates from the tone established in a couple scenes and therefore makes you no longer worries for the characters, which takes away the thrill and leaves you not caring. There is a lost opportunity for Miles Teller's character to finally empathize with Tom Cruise and it's missed. And finally, they end the movie with a Lady Gaga song. It's not even a bad song, but when you have one of the greatest theme songs in cinema history and you don't end on it, you've lost me. This is an homage to the 80s tough guy era and to end this epic ride with a song about \"holding hands\" was almost a joke and ruined the movie for me. It's a fun movie and worth seeing but I wish they took the time during its 2 and a half year delay to rethink these little issues that ended up taking away a lot from the film. Easily the best remake/reboot/sequel film. Could have been so much better but also could've been so much worse with what Hollywood has been dishing out lately. Tom cruise is the best working actor today.",

Maverick doesn't get the pilot love story, but it does have a lot of amazing flying scenes. This is a movie you don't want to think too much about, otherwise you will spend a few hours thinking about how this whole mission could very easily, and safely, be achieved with a simple cruise missile strike, or you'll scratch your head at how a US Navy captain can afford a multi-million dollar P-51 Mustang. It's a Tom Cruise movie, leave your brain at the door. If you do that, you will enjoy an action packed fun movie which may lack a story, but compensates for it with amazing flying scenes.",

The reminiscence scenes are stretched and full of nothingness, characters appear briefly only to vanish into oblivion the next second, and writers expect us to care about them? All the un logical action scenes could have been shot in front of a green screen and nobody would have noticed nor cared. The most shocking thing is that it's obvious that rotten tomatoes has been sensitive to bribery over the past ten years, with movie studios offering money in exchange for good reviews.

Fighter jet pilots have to be training about \" Inverted \" , don't they ?\nSpinning flight situation or inverted flight situation will be necessary at the actual fly combats .\nInteresting .\n\nI think it will soldiers put \" Robotic \" Armed something on their live body at near the future .\nLike Ironman . But , it's so risky .\nFor example : Army Delta Force soldiers or Navy Seals soldiers will put Armed Robotic Suits on their body , it will come .\nHow about this ? Navy Seals soldiers sometimes \" Swim \" in the sea or river at their mission . \nThey need something suits for diving .

You just need well written characters. And Top Gun: Maverick has those, spending a surprisingly large amount of time establishing them, which I believe is a very good thing. It also has great jet scenes that, instead of focusing on having the fate of the universe on the mission's shoulders, are entertaining because you care about the characters (and the jet tricks are pretty cool). I wasn't a fan of the first Top Gun, but this is an amazing movie. It feels so much like an older movie in all the right ways, while having the advantages of modern cinema. It never feels too long, it never milks nostalgia (though will be nostalgic for fans of the first movie), and it never forces political messages down your throat. It just focuses on being a good movie, which every movie should aim for, but very few modern ones actually try to achieve. Overall, Top Gun: Maverick is a fantastic movie that will hopefully teach a lesson to Hollywood: Stop milking nostalgia and just make a great movie with realistic characters. It pays off.",

Pete \u2018Maverick\u2019 Mitchell of the Air Force while also co-producing He\u2019s assisted by a much bigger cast this time from Jennifer Connelly to Miles Teller to John Hamm to Glen Powell The first film directed by the late Tony Scott was memorable for its hit song \u2018Danger Zone\u2019 and the exhilarating fighter jet sequences not to mention the banter between him and Val Kimer\u2019s Lt. Tom \u2018Iceman\u2019 Yet when it wasn\u2019t doing that the drama on the ground was less than stellar with characters being kinda shallow So the sequel this time has \u2018Maverick\u2019 being an instructor inspiring future pilots at Fighter Pilot School aka Top Gun Everyone though has doubts and he has a huge weight on his shoulders if anything happens to them while in training He also reunites with his former flame Penny Benjamin Under orders by the new admiral Maverick has 3 weeks to train these pilots to destroy a supply of uranium without engaging in enemy fire; their training will push them defying gravity, air speed, pressure, and trying to avoid dog fights in aerial combat Goose\u2019s son, Rooster has a chip on his shoulder and perfectly so since he blames his father\u2019s death on Maverick which he\u2019s had a hard time letting go The film opens with the same 80\u2019s energy of movie 1 which is good to get back to basics This definitely does many things miles higher than the first film The fighter jet sequences are way more intense putting the viewer in the cockpits going up, down, sideways and all the various aerodynamics The sound editing and mixing is brilliant giving off that intensity of these aircrafts The drama is actually legitimate and doesn't ground everything to a halt Cruise still owns this role but learning now that being cocky has its disadvantages and there's even a touching cameo by an actor from the original that feels like a perfect sendoff This movie kinda pushes it being over 2 hours long but it still delivers the fun summer popcorn feels that the original director Tony Scott established I absolutely loved Lady Gaga\u2019s number in this too Cliched ending aside and being over 2 hours this is way more of a coherent piece of character drawing and more exhilarating spectacle piece This was absolutely worth the wait!

When I read some of the reviews of this movie, I wondered if I suffered through the same bad acting, the hackneyed cornball testosterone-soaked crap that they did. The scene in the bar was as awful as any I've seen in a while--a rehash of the original, corny, trite, clearly aimed at intellects that are amazed when they successfully button their shirts.\n\nAfter half this awful waste of money (including mine), we left; my wife and I both gave it a 50 out of 100, and the more I thought about it, the lower the rating plunged. \n\nWaste no time going to this movie.\nNothing is better than this movie.\nThe writer of this movie has more talent in his whole body than I do in my little finger.\n\nCurious: what happened to the wrinkles on Cruise's face? When he spoke to the audience before the film, he had lots of them; in the movie, he looked about 30. I wonder how many millions were spent with CGI, removing all the wrinkles and turkey neck.\n\nHow come Cruise, who was in his 20s in the original (which came out 36 years ago), shows up and immediately hooks up with the bar owner who looks about 30 or 35? I thought she was his daughter (he's a scientologist, so who the h*ll knows)...",

It soooo good!\nIt was just really well done and not campy - the storyline was perfect - it was a great way to bring in all the fighter jet scenes. They did a good job of paying homage to the original without being super sappy. The scene with Iceman was my favorite - if Tom Cruise is going to ever get nominated for any acting roles, I would nominate him for that scene alone. In fact, if this movie doesn\u2019t get nominated for ANY categories, then Hollywood, why even bother making another movie?\nProb the best movie sequel ever.",

What I was surprised of is that the rest of the pilots were good at recreating that slightly cheesey feel good vibe that the original had. There were more of the same old planes and some nondescript next-gen planes that I couldn't pinpoint. Something Easter Europe or Chinese but I couldn't say. Great piloting and a really good movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Overall a great experience. BTW, I love the first movie so much I named my German Shepherd Maverick. he turned out to be exactly like Tom Cruise in this movie. it's my fault, I guess.",

The music is outstanding, and the use of songs is much more in control than the first. Unlike the first movie, where the final battle comes out of nowhere, this entire movie builds up to this impossible mission, and the finale has so much tension and pay off.

            "content": "Curiosity got the better of me. Many of my online acquaintances have been raving about how good, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" was. Being an old geezer myself, I thought it might be good to check it out. After all, I was almost 15 when I watched the first one in the theatre. I remember how hot it was outside while I was in line waiting. I saw the original in Ontario Oregon. It was showing in one of the only movie theatres that was close to where I lived. I remember being really impressed with the jet fighter stunts. Back then there wasn't any computerized special effects. I imagine it was a great recruiting tool for the Navy.\n\nThis movie was not what I was expecting. Lately all Hollywierd seems to put out is woke, sjw, perverted, pinko-commie, propaganda. I have had my fill of those American hating, red diapered, doper babies. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and by my online friends. They didn't steer me wrong. One might bemoan the fact that there was a female Top Gun fighter pilot. I thought they were going to push radical feminism. I am from a time when women were not allowed in combat roles. I still think that should be the case, but it isn't up to me. Women in combat roles is a reality now whether I like it or not. Most movies would beat this idea into you. They'd put it front and center, and force you to, \"Hear her roar!\" Well, this movie did not do that. It was just a matter of fact that she was there. It wasn't pushing a feminist agenda. I'd say the same about the ethnic diversity reflected in the cast. America isn't as homogeneous as it was when I was a kid. Again, they didn't push this in the plot, or make it a propaganda subtext to be washing our minds with. Score one point for the team who made this movie. It was pure entertainment with no preaching, or blatant propaganda.\n\nThis was first, and foremost, a movie about Top Gun fighter pilots risking their lives for this country. It was patriotic. It was emotionally moving. It had some laughs along the way. There were scenes from the original movie worked in as memory moments. There were a couple memorable characters from the first film. I even had to try to hold back a tear now and then.\n\nThis movie achieved success because it was for the audience, not some perverted America hating fringe minority of America, but for Americans in general. \"Guess what Hollywierd, there are more of us than there are of them, and they don't go to see movies. When they do, the movies are never woke enough for them.\" We, on the other hand, are easy to please. Just give us good movies! Hopefully the box office $$$ are teaching them a lesson. Tom Cruise may be a crazy, Hollyweird, Scientologist, but he hasn't forgotten how to reach out to regular Americans. I think that is because he hasn't forgotten that he is an American.\n\nThe jet stunts were phenomenal. If you have ever been to an airshow, and seen the Blue Angels perform, you know what I'm talking about. It looked like a lot of these stunts were completed by real pilots in real jets. I might be wrong. I'm sure some of the stunts in the end of the movie were computerized, but you don't notice it during the action. The acting of the supporting cast was good. The younger crowd did their part to make the movie magic happen. There are even some mechanical and location cameos if you will. The Kawasaki motorcycle from the original, reprised it's role, as well as the bar where the boys sang, \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling.\" That song was not present, but there was another from the original that was. You'll have to see it to find out.\nIf you haven't seen it, and are thinking about it, just to do it. You'll really enjoy it.",

Tom Cruise's 46th Film is an Action Packed, promising delivered Hollywood Blockbuster awaiting to be seen from an audience on the big silver screen.\n\nAchieving what Top Gun: Maverick finalized is an extraordinary feeling. The Story carries itself with a calm opening staring Tom Cruise, and a trip down memory lane through portraits on a wall of Goose and his family from the first \"Top Gun\" Film. We are immediately introduced to the score as well as the personality of Maverick himself. After many years, Maverick still seems to be dedicated to flying, and going against commands just like his younger confident/reckless self.\n\nA new series of younger cast members is sweet, and faultlessly introduced. We meet a good chunk of prior Top Gun Academy graduates at Penny's Bar, exploring only a few piolets that have the chance to fly in a mission more complicated than any other mission Maverick has flown.\n\nMonica Barbaro playing Lt. Natasha 'Phoenix' Trace is the only female Top Gun Academy Graduate in recent years according to the film's cast and story. She brings a fresh satisfying performance, and perfectly shares the correct chemistry with the cast. Since she is one of the \"more talented\" piolets as introduced in her first flying exercise with Maverick, we get to know that her, as well as all the other piolets are very ambitious, and ready to impress even though it seems harder than expected.\n\nThe films story is noticeably dull after act I, and easily identifiable during act II. Director Joseph Kosinski does a decent job trying to keep the audience hooked, as well as Claudio Miranda with the Shots, but the Top Gun franchise already having a specific theme and mood set, its harder to identify specific director elements since its a franchise film.\n\nThe Shots in Top Gun: Maverick are beautifully crafted. The Cinematography from Oscar Winner Claudio Miranda does not disappoint with the use of interesting angles giving us an exact perspective of how the characters feel and certain times. The Lighting and Jet Shots are equally as interesting to watch.\n\nFor a film in 2022, Top Gun: Maverick is easily one of the better pieces of Film shot using a Digital Camera (Sony VENICE) still delivering a natural movie look. Although the film started out interesting, and became dull, but later retained the audience based on the more interesting side of the plot, and the exciting score, Top Gun: Maverick was not entirely a bad film, but extremally pleasing for a sequel that has nearly took 4 decades to produce.",

            "content": "\"Don't think, just do.\" - The Navy recruiter waiting at a booth just outside your theatre after Top Gun: Maverick finishes.\n\nThis long-brewing Top Gun sequel is a lot of things - a reinforcement of the tendency for studios to invest their biggest wads of cash into sequels or remakes of established properties, a surprising combination of pro-military sentiment and actual quality instead of generic machismo, and most importantly: the single most successful and complete summer blockbuster in years (in the classic interpretation). While you will benefit from having seen the original, Maverick isn't like other must-see films that require previous experience with a massive shared universe, it's pure entertainment value in a way that seems to have been lost. The storyline is gloriously simple without being simplistic; you can leave Kissinger's notes on geopolitical maneuvering at the door, because all you need to know is that there's a nameless country starting to make secret nukes and we've got to pull off crazy air stunts to stop them. There's traditional old vet/new hotshot conflicts, a slightly unsure romance, training montages, the heart-to-heart, condescending superior officers, the slow-motion shirtless beach sports scene showing them all coming together - it's all the things you would expect to be there, but they're executed flawlessly by a production team that clearly knew what they were doing. That's not even mentioning the absolutely incredible practical action effects that went into this movie; you've got to see it on the big screen to fully appreciate, it's nothing short of glorious. It's easy to dismiss every Hollywood action flick as cheap entertainment, but films like this demonstrate that there is an artistry to it, the talent to make a proven movie formula seem fresh and exciting, and Top Gun: Maverick nails it. If Bruce Willis were still acting, you would expect to see a wave of similar sequel films from '90s action hits coming out in two years or so directly as a result of the positive feedback to this film specifically.\n\nPeople talk a lot about how Tom Cruise has literally defied the aging process (and a well-heeled makeup department certainly helps), but props to the casting director for picking out his less commonly cited contemporaries - the very gracefully aging Jennifer Connelly and the eternally 65-ish Ed Harris. (4.5/5)",

But I think the stand-outs are: 1) clearly Tom Cruise having fun which projects onto the screen, and 2) very little use of CGI.  You can be assured that the views from inside the jets are real, the G-forces are real (not sure if the actors endured 10 G's, but at least a few.

Getting into the heart of the movie, I believe that the themes expressed of courage even when the odd are against you, and the burden of being forced to bear past guilt in our daily lives are expressed extremely well.

I like how they worked Val Kilmer into the film. For those that don't know, he has been sick in real life and they wrote the script to include that into the movie. \nThe chemistry between Cruise and Connelly is excellent. The only thing I would have changed about the film is adding more time with them rekindling their romance and Cruise's interaction with her daughter Amelia. \n I love what they did with the music. They didn't attempt to change the music brought back from the original film. And the added new songs are excellent. \nIt's very refreshing to have an excellent drama/adventure film that doesn't involve comic book heroes. A patriotic film is what this nation needs and this delivered it 100%.\nI highly recommend seeing this in theaters.",

In a way this movie is a metaphysical commentary of itself as the dinosaur in the room that doesn't lean into nostalgia in an obligatory way. It builds upon the legacy that came before it without dismantling the past.  Honestly, the script treats its characters with care and the reverence that made room for it become a sustainable IP while also sending off characters and actors with grace and honor.  In ways, it's the antithesis of the modern reboot that can only build up new characters by dismantling old ones.   There is a reason that my friends have gone to see this movie at the imax and some have seen it as many as 2-3 times in the theatre.

But Tom Cruise made the right decision: this movie HAD to be seen in a theater, not at home.  Larger than life characters, phenomenal action scenes, and the SOUND.

I'm absolutely floored \ud83d\udc4f Now the Oscar Best Picture buzz is a little exaggerated. But at the same time it's not too exaggerated either??? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I can definitely see it getting a nomination. It has those all-American crowd pleaser qualities with so much heart and soul in its story and characters. I'm so surprised they made it work narratively even despite not having a traditional conflict, nor a traditional human antagonist. They managed to imbue stakes, tension and effective human drama in a simple pilot bombing mission. Tom Cruise shines in his performance as the titular Maverick and the new cast of characters succeed at presenting themselves to be endearing and humanized. The piloting action sequences are breathtaking, capturing a certain immersion and making the audience feel like they are sitting in the cockpit. The production and sound design are nothing short of immaculate. Even when 'Top Gun: Maverick' sticks with its cheesy and formulaic tropes, and even when it starts veering into predictable territory, it all comes together excellently, making for one of the most memorable cinematic blockbuster experiences of the year. A viewing in IMAX is essential.",

This movie has some of the best action sequences I\u2019ve ever seen. The story is also compelling. There are plenty of callbacks for fans of the original, while also providing a fresh, original story. This movie has everything you could want. I laughed, I cried, I nearly passed out from excitement at one point. I am a better person for having seen this film. The only thing that could have possibly made this movie better is if Iceman had a son who was a main character in the movie. He could have been played by Chris Hemsworth and his callsign could have been \u201cIce Cube\u201d. Missed opportunity. Even so, this is one of the best action movies of all time.

I also loved the music. 80's synth pop is my jam lol. The theme of overcoming past regrets and pain through pushing past your demons and seeing what really matters; your pilots. your crew. your loved ones, puts things into perspective.\n\nAs an aside it was nice to see a film that was patriotic. The dog fights were stunning, and the whole training sequence where Cruz tries to get his pilots to make the canyon run in a certain amount of time, and how they eventually achieve it is intense. It makes you really grip the edge of your seat, but not in a flashy overly manic way. \n\nI loved the movie and hope people give it a try. Great nods to nostalgia and pervious characters.

The nostalgia is there, sure, but it's just a damn good movie.

I didn't find the scenario they were in particularly likely and the romance part felt a little forced but the bulk of the movie truly was incredibly entertaining. It probably helped to be seeing it in a movie theater where on each side of us were older couples who would likely have seen the first one in theaters too -- I heard one of them crying during the scene with Kilmer and that added a lot to my viewing experience. The casting was impeccable and the sustained level of suspense throughout the third act was super impressive. I wasn't a big fan of the first movie at all, particularly the airplane scenes as I found them disorienting and couldn't easily tell the planes apart from one another; this one corrects both problems completely, improves on the human drama & isn't worse in any category, not even the music.

Not in terms of characters, there are some consistent through lines.  Where it differs greatly is its tone.  While the original might have been a bit over the top, it was still grounded in realism.  This movie seems closer to Mission Impossible with planes, or at the more extreme end, a Sci Fi movie.  That's not to say it can't be entertaining, it can.  It's just feels off...",

Programming note: If you have not seen or watched the original 1986 Top Gun movie, try to do so before you watch/see the 2022 sequel. It will add substantially to your understanding and enjoyment of the movie. The most significant reality of this movie is that you will become part of an audience that will cheer, applaud and laugh out loud as an outpouring of understanding and support for the actors and their actions on the screen. There is a sensation of a return to a time when heroes were men of a character, courage and bravery that made them exceptional. There is a secret mission behind contemporary enemy lines requiring the bombing of a target whose access and destruction will most certainly lead to the death of the pilots being asked to undertake the mission. The skills and almost reckless abandon necessary to train the group of 6 aviators falls to the pilot whose code name is MAVERICK - AKA Tom Cruise - a nickname designated because of his unconventional flying abilities and his recognized disrespect for the rules.  Strap on your seat belts as you become both a witness and member of a team whose flying skills will take your breath away and have you question the sanity and courage of those who risk their lives to save ours. Suggest you arrive early because word of mouth will have audiences lined up for one of the best films screened in a very long time.\nRating: B - A - C - O - D - Bravery Audacity Courage On Display",

The slick film has adrenaline-filled action, but also heart, particularly in its handling of Van Kilmer's appearance as Maverick's former nemesis, Iceman. Its pacing keeps your attention in the way that old-school stories used to, with an engaging narrative and solid performances that make seeing it at the cinema a real experience.

It's the best movie I've seen in a long time, however, that's a low bar for Hollywood these days. The action scenes were phenomenal and Tom Cruise is an amazing actor. \nAs for some nitpicks, there were a few too many nostalgia bait scenes/lines. The new pilots were a bit like caricatures of personalities with no depth, so the payoff at the end was hollow except for Maverick. I gotta say Bob was hilarious though. The guy that play's goose's son looks just like him, so great job on that casting choice. It's cool they brought Iceman back but his one scene was really cheesy.\nIn the end, you'll watch this movie for Tom Cruise's performance and the amazing action scenes. The plane sequences were extremely realistic and a lot of fun to watch. You really felt like you were there.",

The movie was never dull. There were multiple thrilling scenes that had me on the edge of my seat. The score is excellent providing a great complement to the action, the triumphs, and the tension. The script was tightly focused on the relevant communications while in the air, but, even outside of the flying scenarios, the characters were well-written and motivated. My only critique was that the romance seemed a bit forced and a little cheesy. However, the movie does a great job of allowing you to escape into the world and get caught up in the action. I highly recommend Top Gun Maverick.",

Not a rehash of the first film, it capitalizes on the strengths of the original while adding much greater sophistication and character development. Its literally the commies who disliked Top Gun: Maverick, while everyone else justifiably enjoyed it. Unlike some recent cinematic disasters, the film wasnt designed to subvert expectations, rather, it meets and then surpasses them. Some have said that the summer blockbuster film genre is heading to extinction. Maybe so, but not today. While the film has a great supporting cast with excellent character development and convincing acting, its all about Tom Cruises Maverick. Naval aviator is not what he is it's who he is... And hes taking you along for the ride. I saw it with one person who hadnt seen the original and another who didnt like the original, but they each enjoyed the sequel.  Top Gun: Maverick is the best film Ive seen in theaters in years, and I promise youll enjoy it. And more importantly, youll feel far better for having seen it. Has all the trouble of the world gotten you down? Its time to let it go and go see Top Gun: Maverick.",

Top Gun: Maverick is the high energy, funny, exhilarating motion picture cinemas and audiences need\u2013and\u2013it's full throttle heart! Furthermore, the absolutely brilliant combination of screenwriting, directing, and all the technical elements combine to acknowledge and build upon the nostalgia without resting its laurels on it or hiding behind the cultural and cinematic touchstone that was the original Top Gun. I didn't know a long-awaited sequel more than 30-years from the original could be THIS good\u2013in fact\u2013it's better than the original. We are talking Wrath of Kahn compared to Star Trek the Motion Picture here. Maverick represents that some stories, characters, and themes are truly timeless. Even the most casual fans of the original will be touched by everything this film has to offer. I cried several times, and I am not alone. Multiple fellow critics have remarked this film moved them to tears as well. Familiar, yet fresh doesn't begin to capture the magnitude of diegetic and cinematic success of delivering the surprisingly perfect experience of this film that could very well be on its way to Best Picture of the Year nominations. Maverick is the film that we need as a country, as a world right now! Its plot is equal parts character and action-driven, and no scene or character is wasted or simply inserted to satisfy some nostalgia checkbox. Not only a love letter to the cinematic phenomenon that was Top Gun, it's ostensibly a love letter to the cinematic experience in terms of scale and scope of the adrenaline-pumping high-flying adventure! We need this film at such a time as this. It's an uplifting, positive, constructive motion picture for all! Fly, don't walk to your nearest cinema that offers premium formats like IMAX or Dolby to experience this epic story on the BIG SCREEN.",

The rest of the cast, especially Teller, are also well done, with lots of 'likeable asshole' type characters (like Cruise himself). \nIf I had to criticize this film, the plot is really dumb, just like the first film, and the ending, while not bad, weakened after people started bailing out.

The movie didn't just explore the present era but also used the past to connect the two together in a masterful way. The story was good and believable plus the fact that no CGI (except for the enemy fighter jets which are SU-57 NATO designation \"Felon\", Russia's 5th Gen aircrafts) was used for the flight/dogfight scenes, definitely made the movie to be in a league of its own. The only reason that they had to use CGI to show off the Russian SU-57 \"Felon\" fighter jets was that I am sure Russia would not have permitted the use of their own best new 5th generation aircraft for an American movie where their aircrafts are blown out of the sky by 4th generation American fighter jets. \n\nThe work these actors including Tom Cruise had to go through to capture the reality of all events was simply masterful and you see why Tom Cruise delivers again and again as a box office draw, even after decades of movies. Anyone who saw the 1st \"Top Gun\" 1986 movie have to see this movie because it's beyond a cult culture movie. I know this sequel is the last \"Top Gun\" movie and it saddens me because after watching this movie, I was left wanting. But, as the saying goes \"All good things must come to an end\". And this movie had it all, from start to finish. It gave me shivers and the nostalgia factors made me choke at times. That's how good this movie brought out emotions from the viewers who were of age to see the original 1986 movie when it first came out. \n\nNothing in this movie was overboard, everything was carefully measured so that it would have a multitude of moments that touched every chord of emotions. I remember when the first Top Gun movie came out, the military had an incredible influx of men/women wanting to join the military's every different branches, some wanted to be pilots, some infantry, Army, Marines, Rangers, some special operators and so on. I wonder if this sequel will have the same effect of patriotisms that the first one had? \n\nBottom line, if there's only one movie you could/would see out of all the other movies that are out and coming out right now, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is the movie to watch. There's never been a movie like this and nor will there be another movie like it ever again. It's perfect in all its multiple facets and worth every penny to watch. So, if there's only one movie you can watch this summer, \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is the one to watch. I've already seen it 3 times.",

He would have been vaporized.\nAll the Goose references were boring and overdramatic, as were most of the scenes with Maverick and Rooster. The love interest was just tossed in because there had to be one. The beach football scene was only there because of the beach volleyball scene in the original. Many scenes seemed unnecessary and overly long (with lots of too long closeups of concerned looking faces).\nAt over 2 hours it was an hour over what it needed to be. I nearly walked out mid-movie, but knew there had to be an exciting climax with the fighter jets (which was quite good). Wait until it's streaming, and just watch the last half hour, minus the last 10 minutes of hugging.",

            "content": "Wow, went with my dad to see this as an early Fathers Day present and it was well worth it, I love this so much and there's plenty to talk about so I'll break it into sections. \n\nAlso Fun Fact: My dad worked on the plane used in the opening credits, and it was so nice to see him excited to see it even if it was only there for a few minutes.\n\nScore: Whilst they still use a lot of the original soundtrack like Danger Zone, they add a modern spin on them through remixes and plenty of new and catchy songs, even if it's not as perfect as the original song-wise. Reusing the songs also fit the fact that it's more of a requel, as it mixes in a lot of the old stuff whilst not sticking to those conventions of cheesy 80's movies, allowing this to be more unique and beautiful.\n\nCinematography: It's surprisingly gorgeous for an action movie, and sometimes it can even be the focus above the action which I'll always appreciate. They use a lot of bright colours, summertime hues (oranges, reds, yellows, and bright saturation to create a very cosy environment. It definitely gives off summer blockbuster vibes, leaning into that meta cheesiness they use like the original did. They also choose their landscapes very carefully making the environment feel more lived in, and it adds a contrast to the military zones so you feel different when in both separate areas: more controlled in the military but less in nature as you have less control over it. \n\nActing: Another Tom Cruise movie that's basically just him being himself, minus all the running. Miles Teller is the star here, and his role is just the perfect legacy to Goose in the 1st Top Gun. He juxtaposes Maverick really well and their passive-aggressive dynamic throughout is the highlights of the movie, much like Goose and Maverick in the 1st; their dynamic at the end is even better, and I love how they tie this in with him and it's so beautiful and surprisingly emotional. Rooster also is so likeable, and it's so impressive how similar to Goose he is. Icebox is the other legacy character, and everytime I see him I just can't stop feeling bad for Val Kilmer, as he tries his best but what he's reduced to is honestly heart-breaking, but for what he can do they utilise him to the best he can. Phoenix and the rest of the supporting cast are all pretty memorable, minus Fanboy and Payback who don't get much screentime till the end, and even then they don't do much to make them memorable sadly. On the opposite, Hangman is another really interesting side as he has a stereotypical douche role but his development makes me like him way more than I should, even surpassing greats like Malfoy, etc. The one character I couldn't get behind was Penny, as she's during the period inbetween the two films so she doesn't get a proper introduction and just feels so forced and basic, like she's a love interest but she's only really funny and I liked the end scene in the plane but apart from that I didn't get behind her character at all. \n\nPlot: Another Top Gun movie about planes, dogfighting and missiles but with a surprising amount of heart behind it. Being a faithful requel that respects the original is a godsend, and it feels so much more impactful and emotional than it should. Goose is really well developed and the plot revolves around letting go of the past by welcoming in the future and it was a nice sentiment that helped end the franchise on the best possible note. The villains were extremely basic intentionally, kind of dehumanised which was an interesting choice that I respect but I wish they created higher stakes as the training was more intense than them. The ending fight was insane and perfect, with improved CGI and way better visuals that made the dogfights truly memorable and the best parts. The only thing that fell flat was the romance between Maverick and Penny, as it felt half-baked and having her be established between the two films but never properly introduced makes her so bland and the only thing that feels like a true cop-out in this movie, which is a shame as it had potential if another legacy character was instead returned or had they set here up better.\n\nOverall: The second best film of the year behind The Batman, but such a great time and I'm so glad I experienced this in the cinema with my Dad, who's a huge Plane nerd and we just had the widest smiles on our faces the whole movie.",

Nonetheless, this was highly entertaining, fun, and suspenseful.  \n\nAs far as Tom Cruise goes, I think he did a very good job in his role.  Would I call it his best role?  No, he can actually do better.  If you want to see him at his best, watch Vanilla Sky or Born on the 4th of July, or even Jerry McGuire, which are far better displays of his acting abilities, and better material for him to show that he actually is quite a good actor when he gets something more intelligent to do.  Frankly I wish he did more serious roles, but that is hard to resist when you can make big bucks doing action flicks.  Poor Tom, I bet he is crying all the way to the bank :-)  .",

            "content": "Perfection manifests before your very eyes when you least expect. You would not know till you saw it fully, whether after you turned the last page of the book, reflect after the last line sung including being enveloped by what's around or in front of you, or after the very last moment of a picture. Even if a 5-star rating been given, there's always a hint of imperfection. Few pictures were rated perfectly like a rare occasion, especially if you find a hidden gem, but those very few are mainstream cinema, and \"Top Gun: Maverick\" gets saluted in joining the high ranks.\n\nAn unexpected triumph considering the favorable 1986 cult classic \"Top Gun\" turned out critically mixed between genuinely electrifying aerial shots and grounded unmemorable characterization. It got bolstered in recognition, aside from how it soars, as one of Tom Cruise's early roles alongside Meg Ryan and Val Kilmer next to Kelly McGillis and Anthony Edwards with an 80s definitive soundtrack then converses in discussable themes that were ignited on sight. It speaks nostalgia for the generation that flew with them when invited back to the lost art's program, while a replication of that experience for the new generation of flyers who eventually, out of probability to minor extent of possibility, approached the original prior to seeing the sequel. Admired respect for the overall enjoyed craft carried towards the viewing pleasure of sensing that familiar feeling of reunited territory in brightened spirits.\n\nCaptain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, one of Navy's top aviators putting in more than 30 years of service, is at peace where he is, continuously pushing the barriers for naval aviation as a courageous test pilot while dodging from advancement that would ground him. His need for speed puts him closer to the field up in the sky rather than observing from far below. He gets invited back, or rather ordered as assignment, to the Top Gun program in training detached graduates, being the best of the best, for a mission no living pilot ever flown. One of those top tier pilots is Lieutenant Bradley \"Rooster\" Bradshaw, the son of his late-wingman Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw.\n\nThe emotional core of \"Top Gun: Maverick\" is Edwards's character Goose's accidental death in the original whereas Maverick finally grasps the traumatizing danger of naval aviation that he does not want to experience again nor ever repeated. Still haunted and blaming himself, it not only put a wedge into his relationship with his best friend's son, who is marching onto his father's footsteps, it gets acknowledged and later felt in the follow-up as his main motivation to undo his mistaken call, despite reluctance out of protective promise. Confrontation must get through for a dangerous mission that requires the ultimate sacrifice from those who must fly it with careful precision, or all is lost.\n\nMost revived returns for cinematic storytelling started out mostly retreading acclaimed storylines just to reaffirm the hold of the roots after so long, then carried through the rest of the story before subsequent chapters find their own directions after the familiar welcoming. Defensively a realistic trope recalling that history tends to repeat itself if not careful, but this is storytelling that offers new insights interpreted towards what we already know. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" perfected that very prompt as an example that not just` add onto the original for those seeking nostalgia but also in replicating that very experience for what the current, younger generation also seeks while additionally attracted as a star vehicle. Ultimately something to offer for both crowds to relish in shared experience at equal enjoyment when signature elements were put into play then reflectively been given added purpose coming across as actual meaningfulness. This created a more memorable experience in connecting with the characters more through the grateful update, and director Joseph Kosinski already proved his directorial capability of tackling and updating a classic with improving entertainment as seen in \"Tron: Legacy\". That piece of knowledge should have painted this film with reassurance beforehand, while also honoring late-director Tony Scott's vision of what the sequel could be in a [sensibly] timely matter.\n\nIf you watched \"Top Gun\" for viewing refreshment just prior to see the sequel, then those definitive elements would stay fresh in your mind with gained respect, particularly in recognizing the musical patterns. Initially non-catchy out of distance like an ordinary passerby, but not without understanding how it bolsters the film, especially between \"Danger Zone\" and \"Great Balls of Fire\", which activates reminiscence upon recognizing not just the continued narrative but feeling the importance. This goes in particularly with the score by returning composer Harold Faltermeyer representing the sole artistic signature stemmed previously, joined by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe as each expressed certain aspectual fields throughout the film at their expertly resonating best with collectively riveting results. The exceptional music does not fully claim the film as its own when newly sung soundtrack equally contributes between OneRepublic's \"I Ain't Worried\" during the film's own beach scene and Lady Gaga's \"Hold My Hand\" better capturing respective energy that each required. This is another resulted effect in jointed association with the examined direction passionately uplifting the heartened spirit that the original barely embraced out of insignificance amidst a casual decade.\n\nNot only did the sequel improved by being better than the first film by memorable impact from contemporary stance, it ascends higher not just towards perfection but in emotionally gripping heights. Truly exhilarates the satisfying need for speed with such authenticity that enabled the aerial sequences more realism with aimed practicality over visual effects, especially the fact Cruise persisted acquiring aviation training for the cast to complete. It impresses before at bland engagement towards decent moderation, but everything here from introductions and buildups to overall training accumulating towards the climatically fateful mission is absorbing under the right engagement to actually thrill. This is a combined collaboratively synced effort of reflectively depicting Tony Scott's \"Top Gun\" in a current period by Kosinski alongside Ehren Kruger and Eric Warren Singer, as well Christopher McQuarrie furthering the stakes and precision with a hint of \"Mission: Impossible\" fuel at similar action-packed rate. Therefore ascending the flights closer to boundless limits than an enemy dogfight which helps the developmental absorbent with thrilling results and fully realized heart that was lost in the steamed fog; actually enabling a more immersive, theatrical experience at intentional peak.\n\nThoroughly perfect through these respects, and the casting is no exception when they individually exceed expectations in their performances. Fresher blood in the continuous narrative veins are highlighted breakthroughs among the dispatched Top Gun flyers through more connective mainstream cinema as they independently build their characters up from the writing and appealingly shine individually while also dynamically work off of each other seamlessly. Charismatic fun adding onto the generally spirited heart, typically bolstering their stardom. Miles Tellers stands out the most among the new recruits as Rooster, and it is genetically perfected embodiment of energetically channeling Anthony Edwards's presence down to his behaviorism. Rest of the supporting cast, namely Jennifer Connolly as Maverick's love interest Penny with wholesome chemistry at her most memorably definitive role, performed just as impeccably excellent over them being brilliantly casted.\n\n\nTom Cruise was going to be casted in a smaller role during early developments that were seemingly active in the pre-stages more than a decade ago, but gladly became more involved within the story as it got more emotionally connected. Cruise tends to single-handedly hold a film as effortless reliance through his authentic dedication of achieving realism as a somewhat minimalist regarding visually supportive effects that disconnect from the depicted experience, and rarely starred in a bad picture when he energetically pilots the action as the main motivating driver. Any roles he takes seems taken seriously by truly becoming the character as much it is already part of him, which positions Maverick casually closest to the actor's charismatic self in purist form. He has what it takes to fulfill the characterization, from humorous wit and gentle caring to justifying the emotional resonance. With all that said underlining general praise towards the actor, his reprised, pre-Ethan Hunt role is more than just joining the film's superiority but mainly a showcase at his arguable defining best.\n\nAs Cruise's character pivots the narrative direction as well displayed tactics that effects the others, there is an argument as he represents where the sequel takes off countering where Jon Hamm representationally stands by the book that grounded the original. Hamm plays Vice Admiral Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson, a straightforward Naval Commander who is seriously set by the numbers and did not consider recruiting Maverick as a trainer considering his past troubles but persuaded by his certain idol's insistence. A powerhouse, humane performance for Hamm as he set records straight while leaving Maverick to provoke realization on what needs to be done, straining reluctance on the commander's position.\n\nFinally, while Ryan and McGillis reasonably were not asked to return because frankly there is no sensible purpose as they would have diverted the impact from the designated path to land, Val Kilmer returns as Admiral Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky. Iceman is Maverick's former rival till they became close friends as each other's wingman, especially when he been backing up Maverick over his troublesome risks that the Navy disapproves of. The actor's self-portrait documentary \"Val\" reflects both his journey and career's challenging pursuits as well explaining his current medical condition should be a prerequisite viewing before boarding \"Top Gun: Maverick\" to fully understand where Iceman is at. He provides that emotionally purposeful sense of reuniting with the main character to help regain the truest envisioned sight, before nostalgically topping off the friendly dynamic with heartening wit of unfading rivalry. Simply put, he nailed his character's return despite medically limited by verbal communication.\n\nThe poster for cinematic definition under perfection is of \"Top Gun: Maverick\", masterfully done with impeccably crafted efforts. It fueled the adrenaline that was not entirely felt in the enjoyably appreciative original, including emotional weight that uplifts the story towards grips amid achieved immersive aerial sequences, energizes by the brilliantly casted performances nailing exceptionality through thoroughly covered dialogue. The bar been raised in not just the overall storytelling narration but also what truly makes an action flick being additionally layered with another equally associated genre namely drama in a justified match. Arguably Tom Cruise's best film next to his recent \"Mission: Impossible\" films, while the year's best picture yet as it ultimately defends why moviegoing is the only (theatrical) experience to truly feel a film's impact.

The story was great, the use of old and new characters was great, without spoiling it there are some really great moments. Overall the 2 hours fly by and i wanted to go straight back in. My 13 year old daughter who had never seen top gun got a 5 minute run down of the first movie in the car before we got there and she absolutely loved it and wants to go back! So good the sound track cd just arrived and ordered the first and 2nd on blu ray. A must see it in the cinema film for sure",

Every intended comedic moment is done through awkward character dialogue that isn't very funny. the great things about this movie are the cgi (used sparingly), the color grading, and cinematography. The sound effects were also really nice and made a lot of action sequences feel hectic and real. The score is what you'd expect out of a military movie. Overall the movie is uninspired and a quick cash grab based on the classic movie from the 80's, but if you want to see some pretty amazing realistic action sequences and nothing more then this is the movie for you.",

I heard stellar reviews about Maverick, so my wife and I decided to go see it which meant we had to watch the original. While the original was absolutely iconic in its story, footage, and realism, Top Gun: Maverick takes this to an entirely different level! Real FA/18 footage. Real Gs being pulled. A fresh, yet nostalgic story that gives you more feels than you expect. I've already seen it twice in theatres and the ride is definitely meant to see it on the big screen! Highly recommend!",

Mostly good scenario is devasted by bad directors or even a good director couldn't fix a bad plot, and yet the film I'm going to tell you about is a showcase of how directors and screenwriters can cooperate. While they have their drawbacks, Top Gun: Maverick precisely shows us amazing air stunts and yet realistic ones.\nTop Gun: Maverick tells us a story from the perspective of  Pete Mitchell, nickname \"Maverick\" played by Tom Cruise. As the film starts we see him getting ready to become the instructor of Top Gun graduates to prepare them for the dangerous mission.\nExcept for known characters in the film from the previous one, you will see a few completely new ones. Although there are a lot of new personalities in it, they are connected to each other. There are different storylines within the main one. I almost forgot to mention the amazing soundtrack with songs from such popular stars as One Republic and Lady Gaga. Also, I want to admit the work of cameramen). This film is suitable to watch with family due to its PG-13 rating.\nAll in all, Top Gun: Maverick is well-casted, well-filmed and well-scripted. If you like aircrafts, realistic air stunts and dogfights, you have to watch it.",

There is solid music choices some classic returning hits and some new hotness. When things really get tense, there is no music, and leaves me missing some of those '80s bangers revving up the moment. But it would consequentially alter the mood and lower the intensity in said moments. Probably was honestly a good move. It's as awesome of a sequel anyone could ask for, especially this late in the game. Kudos to the director, camera crews, actors and military advisors.",

But after having seen it, all my thoughts suddenly changed, its performances, its action sequences and emotion, the Joseph Kosinski's direction, in summary, I must say that so far it is the most excellent film that I have been able to seen so far on this year 2022. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it to hang out for a while.",

Sure, there was a small far fetched pice of the story line, but somehow that made the film more endearing. The real life \"G's\" on film are worth it just to see this movie in the theater. My favorite part though, was the film's main character, Maverick, and how the film makers managed to make an aging male star still sexy and accessible to all ages. Reminded me of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones in the 90's.",

It was a super enjoyable movie.  It's almost all wrong, in terms of what airplanes can do and how the military employs them, and usually that is enough to make me dislike a movie.  Somehow, Top Gun: Maverick is enjoyable enough, good enough, and fun enough to allow me to see completely passed all the shenanigans with planes pulling G when they're flying straight, prohibited maneuvers, moronic mission plans, magic SAMs, incorrect CM being used, poor tactics, and a pilot who would be kicked out of the Navy for half of the things he does.  I recommend it.  I'd watch it again.  I'll probably try to purchase it at some point.  It's a good show.",

But due to Covid it was delayed to December 2020, then July 2021, then November 2021 then finally May 2022. The lion's share of this movie was shot four years ago. Was it worth it? I say yes. Sequels of iconic films done decades later are under so much scrutiny. Many times actors put off doing sequels in their prime. They wait until the phone stops ringing to cash in on reprising their most memorable roles (think Harrison Ford). Therefore this type of sequel costs vastly more and the pressure is sky high to produce a profit. \n\nThen there's us. We want lightning to strike twice. Unfortunately most times it doesn't. But in my opinion, Maverick delivers. Yes the nostalgia is spilling all over with the 80s music, shirtless football, Goose's son, Rooster playing \"Great Balls of Fire\" on the piano in the bar and Hangman is Iceman light...but Tom's performance is rock solid. He's not playing a cocky kid. Pete Mitchell is a grownup who shows the latest hot shots that they're not as hot as they think and prepare them for an impossible mission (wink). I was glad to see Val Kilmer make a cameo. I would have liked to have seen Tom Skerritt return as Viper. Do the Tom's not get along? \n\nThe movie is legit. It checks all the boxes but it's not all rehash. The story breaks new ground in new territory as well. It's a fun ride. And that's about as good as it gets.",

In a time when studios are constantly resurrecting old films, this is how you breath life into an old IP and make a film worthy enough to be called a sequel.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nMore than 30 years after the first film, we see Captain Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell still flying planes. He's engulfed in a secret scramjet project that's building a prototype capable of flying to Mach 10. His team has successfully tested to Mach 8, and upon hearing the program is getting shutdown by the military for falling behind schedule, he puts his life and career in danger, pushing the aircraft to Mach 10 and beyond.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nInstead of taking the fall as expected, he's sent back to the TOPGUN program to train an elite group of graduates tasked with an urgent bombing mission. The risk and difficulty of the mission requires strenuous training, and his superiors are skeptical that Maverick is up to the task. He soon discovers that \"Iceman\", his rival-turned-buddy from the first film, put in a good word and personally requested his assistance. He also learns that the son of his late best friend \"Goose\" is part of the elite group he'll be training and goes by the call sign \"Rooster\". Their relationship is strained, as Maverick delayed Rooster's advancement to the Naval Academy (based on a promise to Rooster's late mother that he would prevent Rooster from following in his father's footsteps).\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThere are plenty of flashbacks and callbacks to the original \"Top Gun\", as Maverick gets to know his students and rekindles a past relationship in town. Iceman passes away, setting the stage for Maverick's removal from the program by Vice Admiral \"Cyclone\" Simpson, who is not a fan. In a last-ditch effort to prove he's needed, he flies an F/A-18 without authorization through the simulated training course. He completes it in record time, winning the reluctant approval from Cyclone. Maverick is appointed strike leader and forms his team, which includes Rooster.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis is where the film really begins to shine. The animosity between Rooster and Maverick explodes to the forefront, and his fatherly approach to the situation makes you feel an emotional connection to the characters. You're rooting for both of them the rest of the way, and in the final act, the film hits a grand slam with an edge-of-your-seat, fist-pumping adrenaline rush. It tugs at the emotional strings at the right moment to cap off one of the best endings I've seen in a very long time.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWhile the film may struggle at times to appeal to all genders and ages, it has a lot to offer to everyone, especially fans of the original. It seems like many of Bruckheimer's projects these days are hit and miss -- mostly miss -- but Top Gun Maverick will blow you away! The cinematography is next level good, and if you're a fan like I am of James Cameron's slow-panning, immersive action shots (think Terminator 2 or Avatar), you'll be glad to know this non-Cameron film has plenty of that as well. In an era where movies rarely use that tactic any more in favor of close-up jerky movements, it's a sight to behold when you come across a film that does.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nLet this one marinate; you'll be talking about it for years to come! Instant classic!",

New additions of Jon Hamm, Miles Teller, Glen Powell, Monica Barbaro, Lewis Pullman contribute new storyline. \n\nThe plot also shadowly points to a shift in the US's geopolitical standing in the world. Compared to the original release of Top Gun in 1986, there is this reference at the end as to how other countries' air capabilities have significantly improved since then. Sad to see the F-14s that are considered to be easily outgunned by the Su-57s.",

After almost a month since the release date, the theatre was still at 90% capacity in this post pandemic world. A good movie to encourage more big screen attendance as I can assess.\n\nAs for a potential threequel, I'd like to see less macho scenes with the new generation of pilots. Some of the scenes were far fetched to say there least but it was still very entertaining. I would like to see a threequel which focuses more on internal and domestic issues even within the executive branch. Not to get political, but there audience needs to be aware that the external threat portrayed in the sequel is not the most realistic scenario. Focus on internal division leading up to 2024 and beyond and how that translates for the future regardless which side of the aisle you sit on. Domestic and internal threats should be in focus. On the plus side, Maverick did acknowledge that drones and autonomous aircraft are the future. People will still watch these type of movies if you keep it realistic. All in all, three most entertaining movie I have seen this year.",

The movie was atrocious. No real thought put into, same tired plot, different actors. The F-14 vs. SU-57 scene was so far out of touch with reality, I couldn't even laugh. It was just disappointing. The dogfighting scenes and maneuvers were equally unrealistic and so far from reality it was just very disappointing. The original was so much better and it will always be King.  C- grade. Hollywoke can't come up with new content so they copycat off stuff that's already been done 20-30 years and try to re-brand it as something new and the sheep movie viewers continually fall for it.",

It was great to see Val, the person, on screen as well. As Gooses son, Rooster was a great story within the movie and Miles was exceptional. Penny and her daughter, with Mavericks history, added tender family and support touches within this outstanding movie. Charles Parnell, Monica Barbaro, and many of the other actors/actresses completed what I believe to be one of the top ten movies Ive seen in my lifetime. And thats a very long time. \nConsiderable keys to also mention include the use of high-tech filming as well as the actors preparations. It would be a tough decision to weigh the original against the sequel. Maybe Top Gun III will tell the tale.",

The only reason for the missing half star is for the far-fetched-ness of the ending. If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll have no problem overlooking it, as it's still enjoyable as heck... but you will have that inner voice going \"oh, come on... really?\" for a few minutes.

And the actual footage of fighter jets (as opposed to CG) performing the most incredible feats are really what the movie is about.

However, in my view--other than the flight scenes which are worth seeing--the casting and acting is terrible.  Jon Hamm was completely unbelievable and is certainly no Tom Skerritt.  There was zero chemistry between Connolly and Cruise and watching their scenes together was cringe-worthy.  The Top Gun pilots in Maverick don't compare at all to the original--\"Goose\", \"Merlin\", \"Slider\", \"Hollywood\" and \"Wolfman\" were great in the original.  This cast of pilots is really bad, even Powell who plays the knock-off \"Iceman\" (even looking much like the young Val Kilmer in the original).  Dialogue is forced and not very authentic.  I hesitate to call this a \"sequel\" because it is really almost more a remake.  Everything is predictably just like the original...even the stupid beach football game that is the replica of the volleyball game in the original.  I was really disappointed and confused at how people could watch this movie and like it (other than the entertaining flight scenes).",

The flight scenes are simply breathtaking. immersive. Heart pounding. Cruise is clearly at the tippy top of his game. Jennifer Connoley proves to remind that she is an A- list actress, on a very short list at that.  Every scene with the two of them is very enjoyable. Miles Teller was very good, if a bit angry. Think of Goose and his wife, played by Meg Ryan, in the first film. They are both a ton of laughs. Methinks their son would have inherited some of that. Minor issue. The entire cast was well put together and everyone had a moment to shine. Director/ Producer Chris McQuarrie (he didn't direct this one) has a felt presence in the well, well thought out plot, with reference to the original. This film has bright back movies.",

Glen Powell (a.k.a. \"Hangman\") even pulls off a \"Han Solo\" in the end.  Go watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.  Almost shot for shot the end of Star Wars.

They also really missed an opportunity to develop rooster and the supporting cast more. There were some great characters and actors that were kind of tossed to the side in favor of a cheesy romance..

I totally bought Tom Cruise as Maverick 30+ years later. Characters were interesting and the stakes always felt earned. I also loved how certain moments that the writers could have done the same thing as the first Top Gun, they didn't. I also loved how they never had to explain \"This is Penny Benjamin, you know the girl Mav went ballistic with....\" blah blah blah. I loved how the writer and director understands we are smart enough to figure that out (even if you didn't see the cast list already) without doing what just about every other director does these days which is explain everything to us in detail, rather than trusting the audience's intelligence. Also, loved the real planes, real pilots. This is what makes the movie. Definitely a cinematic experience. And the filmmakers are smart enough to know that if you are going to tell a story about the need to have real pilots instead of drones and technology, it's probably a good idea to tell that story with real planes, real pilots, and real effects, otherwise the entire movie is hypocritical. Bravo! Please, please, please...give us MORE of these types of movies!",

They avoided the tropes of many movies from the same genre and keep you on the edge of your seat through not just acting, but well-constructed storyline and character development. I left the theater wanting to walk back in and get the next viewing. This is a MUST SEE!",

So when it comes to producing a sequel to one of the most famous, beloved movies of all time, the task seems just about impossible.  When I heard it was coming, the fact that it was decades after the original also worried me.  \n\nImagine my complete surprise--and utter delight--to finally watch Top Gun: Maverick on the silver screen.  It's a mach-speed romp comprising everything from the perfect pinch of nostalgia to some really satisfying character development to a little romance and comedy to a LOT of fantastic, edge-of-your-seat action sequences.  This movie has EVERYTHING in perfect proportion.  It could've been just a rehash of everything in the original, but it's not.  It could've overdone the nostalgia, or crossed the line from poignant to cheesy, but it doesn't.  Congrats and cheers to the filmmakers, actors, and crew who managed to pull off this miracle--because I think Top Gun: Maverick is actually even better than Top Gun.  Yeah. I said it.",

New Hollywood seems obsessed with sacrificing the diginity of the old to \u201chopefully\u201d sell you the new, but that formula never works out, it is sort of marketing angle awry.

It's right up there with Terminator 2, Aliens and Empire Strikes Back as one of the best sequels Hollywood has ever produced. You'd never think a movie made 35 years after the original could pick up in a logical and consistent place, particularly with Hollywood's tendency to absolutely massacre legacy characters and franchises of late (Last Jedi, Independence Day Resurgence, Jurassic World Dominion, etc...). But this movie picks up without missing a beat off the 1986 original with Maverick still the same cocky, self assured, rule breaking naval aviator he always was, albeit a bit wiser, more world weary and obviously older which makes perfect sense being that it's been 35 years. But the core of who he is, and what Top Gun as a movie was, hasn't been altered in the slightest. Throw in some of the best practical effects you've seen outside a Christopher Nolan movie in decades and you start to realize just how tired the whole deference to CGI has become and how much you've missed the real, or near real, thing. I can't recommend this movie enough, particularly on the big screen.",

Well, Top Gun Maverick created that same feeling. Though this time, the feeling lasted two whole hours. The emotions in this movie are incredible. One moment I'm sitting on the edge of my seat, the next I have tears in my eyes. I wasn't sure if the movie was worth a trip to the theater for me. I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan and as I said, the first part didn't really impress me. But the positive feedback finally convinced me and I thank God for that. The action sequences are incredible. I felt every G-force going through my body. Shivers kept running down my spine and I had goosebumps throughout. Every storyline the movie starts, ends and leaves the audience with satisfaction.

Although Tom Cruise was to focus of this movie and he did a great job, Miles Teller was they key. If Miles did a bad or unbelievable job, it would have ruined the movie. Well he just knocked it out of the park with a great job! Casted perfectly, acted perfectly. Small spoiler alert: My only minor complaint is that Maverick didn't choose Hangman for the mission. He was portrayed as the best, so he should be on the mission. I understand completely why they did it, but in my brain, that didn't make sense. But what a great movie!

A little more humble, humorous, and relaxed makes him a little more believable/relatable in this movie. Jennifer Conley gives a top notch performance. Best action movie Ive seen in quite sometime.",

            "content": "It really doesn't hold a candle to the original, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's just not as fun, not as quotable, and it's far too predictable. The filming in the cockpits is good though, although nothing groundbreaking if you watch IMAX flight movies and search YouTube for the hundreds of Navy and Air Force videos out there. The way the movie revolves around Goose's son is a decent angle, although you feel like Mav got closure at the end of the first movie, so it's unclear why we're reopening that can to the point where a movie revolves around 30 years of him carrying the weight. They did a nice job of tying in old characters and story lines. It's kind of fun that they gave Penny Benjamin a face, although a bit more backstory on what happened to Charlie and how Penny became on-and off all these years would help. Anyway, a good amount of redeeming qualities here, but plenty that held it back as well. There are a few spoilers in here for the few who haven't seen it. \n\nWhy it's not as good as the first:\n\n- Blatant Star Wars Rip-off - Young man who has grown up being told his father is dead is asked to fly a small fighter through a narrow canyon to avoid canons/air defense to fire missiles into a small vent to blow up a larger target. Oh, and much like Luke Skywalker, he does it without his \"targeting computer\". There's even a \"Han Solo shoots the enemy fighter right as it's firing to kill our hero\" moment. Oh, and to show how much the director stuck to the Star Wars script, Maverick 'held Rooster's papers to keep him from going to the academy' exactly like Uncle Owen held Luke's papers to keep him from going to the academy. Hollywood really struggles for new content, but that's a pretty blatant rip-off.\n\n- The Characters are not well developed and aren't nearly as fun as the original. That was disappointing. The character of Goose's son is a major disappointment compared to the character of his dad, who was phenomenal in the original.\n\n- Top Gun: Maverick is not a quotable movie. The first movie had people walking out of the theater quoting 20-30 lines. The dialogue in the first movie was phenomenally well written. This movie is a major letdown in comparison. I'm not sure there's a single quote I will carry with me from this one. What a shame.\n\n- The Director failed in ever getting you to believe the main characters were truly in trouble. There's really no suspense in that regard. You want to be able to feel some tension as you're watching. It's not there.\n\n- Every major thing that happened seemed to be predictable. You could say \"something's going to happen\" and predict what that something was every time without fail. Would be nice to throw a red herring or two out there once in a while to keep the audience on their toes.\n\nThe dumb Hollywood drivel that's far too common:\n- Maverick rides his motorcycle at high speed into a restricted area without anyone batting an eye.\n- An Admiral stands underneath the path of an airplane as it takes off. The plane lifts the roof off the building the Admiral is standing next to. The Admiral is not knocked over. He doesn't flinch. I really hate when Hollywood does this stuff.\n- Maverick is doing tight bank turns at Mach 9+ at one point. Really?\n- Maverick is wearing his jacket with insignia that clearly says, \"Capt Pete Mitchell\" while at a bar. Young Lieutenants continually disrespect him and throw him out of the bar. No way should the Director have had him wearing his name and rank if he wanted to pull off that scene.\n- There's a scene where two pilots are shot down in different parts of an unfamiliar forest, and one manages to sprint straight to the other, despite no line of sight. Again, really?\n\nWhy it's still solid:\n- It's well filmed. Getting the actors to not throw up in the cockpits did add something to it this time, although it's also quite clear they are back seating in some scenes. Still very quality cinematography. It's not necessarily anything you can't find on Military or Smithsonian Channels or on YouTube (there are 100s of high quality videos from inside fighter cockpits these days), but it's still fun to see it on the big screen. \n- Like I said, nice job tying in characters from the first movie. \n-The mission was actually fun as well, even if it's a complete Star Wars rip-off.\n- The plot is solid. It has some minor holes but it's really not a bad story. \n- While there's some significant slowness in early and mid-scenes, it moves well in the latter parts and keeps you entertained once it really gets going.\n\nAll in all, a solid watch and good on the big screen, but not nearly as fun as the first.",

A special callout to the opening sequence: the Mach 10 and the climax sequence. The climax giving tribute to the OG by bringing in the F-14 Tomcat. There was hint early in the film that the Tomcat could make an entry. But one couldn't be sure!\n\nAs a fan who grew up seeing the OG on VCR, DVD multiple times.

The movie does a great job respecting the original and its characters and then it did something I was not expecting... it surpassed the original in every way; This is one of those rare gems that is actually better than the original. \n\nIt took 30 years to make this but like a fine wine, it is exquisite. If you love the original the sequel will not disappoint. You have to see this in a movie theater don't wait to see it at home.
