In a different view, of a more human character, palpable, it can instigate a desire for more from the spectators. With performances by Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, Robert Pattinson, Zo\u00eb Kravitz among others, the film does not become tiring even with almost 3 hours, dividing itself well into moments of action, investigation, and drama that the character Batman still has a lot to offer. Memorable scenes like the chase with the batmobile will be good references for the future.",

This is the second-best Batman movie behind The Dark Knight but it is very hard to top that. I was a little skeptical initially about Robert Pattinson as Batman but I must say he was phenomenal. I saw the movie when it came out in the theatre and feel like writing this now but it is a must-watch! The Riddler is a perfect villain that really does make Batman struggle to win. To me, the 3 hour run time flew right by with perfect pacing and never a dull moment in the movie. 10/10 5 stars would watch it again and again. A perfect adaptation of The Batman.",

Robert Pattinson was amazing as Batman, but I felt less attached to him then I did Bale's or Keaton's. Several actors played their characters with scratchy voices that suited Gotham's atmosphere perfectly! Overall, I am very impressed with how amazing this sequel turned out to be, and I see a lot of potential for its sequels!",

There were a few very interesting scenes we've never seen in movie Batmans. Catwoman I wasn't excited for & she impressed me. The villains were all great especially Penguin wow Collin Farrell.

I just expected a different motivation and attitude with the riddler, but that could be me looking to far into it.

His love interest and moral philosopher is the criminal ninja warrior (catwoman).  They are in a sort-of forbidden relationship (criminal /crime fighter) while paradoxically Batman grows to understand through their intimate conversations where they sometimes make-out that he is the product of BOTH of their fathers sins\u2026meanwhile catwoman has suffered at the hands of both of their fathers.  But then we learn that Batman's dad actually deserves a little credit - yes he got mixed up with the wrong people but ultimately what happened was not intentional - and father Wayne ultimately accepted accountability and paid the price with his life.  Alfred told him this after suffering a brutal attack but looking at the actions of this Batman, there was still no forgiveness deserved for himself or his murdered father.  Later on, there is a scene where Batman appears to be resigned to death - even though we learn later - he was basically fine.  He took what looked like a direct gunshot to the chest armor and after cliffhanger rescue by catwoman he ends up on the floor apparently gravely wounded or possibly dying in her arms until\u2026danger re-emerges and then he heroically stabs himself with a Batman EpiPen \u2026or whatever... some magic drugs let him fight on.  And then shortly afterward Batman is somehow physically healthy again but is now in a dramatic scene where it looks like he is committing suicide for no reason.  After he's already subdued all the bad guys with catwoman and Gordon and they are in no imminent danger he randomly decides to cuts his own line so he can free fall from a Jumbotron with his eyes-glazed over?  Apparently it's so he can land in some waist deep flood waters and then easily rescue some random people who are also not in any imminent danger and then casually walk with them to safety, while holding a torch like Statue of Liberty\u2026.WTF??  I will say that it started good- and I like Jeffrey Wright as Gordon otherwise this is definitely a rotten tomato.",

It was an hour too long, the editing was terrible, Batman really was not all that heroic, and the ridiculous scenes at the end with him saving the children was just so stupid and juvenile and desperate. \n\nThe only thing I liked about this movie was Paul Dano's performance. Turturro was good, he just did not have much to work with. And it was atmospheric. Very dark. Perhaps too dark. And I like dark. \n\nIt was just a really terrible movie. It did have good production values but Robert Pattinson played it with a monotony that was very tiresome, as he tried hard to be a depressed billionaire, and it just wasn't an interesting character. \n\nThere wasn't much to this film, it was not entertainment, and this film felt like it was seven or eight hours long.

The movie is also way too dark, like, if I was to see it with the lights on I'd see nothing. Pattinson is probably the best version of Batman, but the worst version of Bruce Wayne. The movie is also WAY TOO LONG, you could've cut a lot of elements and miss very little. Batman doesn't even fight The Riddler, making this the only Batman movie where Batman doesn't fight the main villain. The action is cool but subpar, the acting is decent but not great, the effects are cool but look fake and all in all, there are too many elements that don't make me enjoy this movie as much as I wanted to like it. Personally not my cup of tea, but if you're a Batman fan, or a DC fan or maybe even a movie fan, I do recommend it. Despite all its flaws, the good elements don't make it a complete waste of time. I do sincerely hope you enjoy it, as it's not a bad movie, it's just not for me.",

It manages to tie together two separate storylines quite well up to the 2 hour mark, at which point an entirely different movie is suddenly slapped on at no additional charge. The climax of the film is a narrative train wreck that feels rushed in spite of the film's overly long runtime. The overall motif of Batman inspiring other people to take the law in their own hands is an interesting take, and Bruce's words at the end leave me interested in what direction they'll take this iteration of the Bat.",

My favorite part was Reeves leaving the warpaint / eye shadow on the character... it was perfect, really showcased the ghastly edge of Bruce.

He is known as the \"World's Greatest Detective\" after all, yet in most of his films, we don't see him do much investigating\u2026 until now. More so than a traditional comic book movie, \u2018The Batman', from director/producer/co-writer Matt Reeves, is a detective story, a refreshing change of pace from the character's previous live-action installments. In the film, Gotham City's elite and \"upstanding\" citizens become the targets of a mysterious serial killer called the Riddler, and Batman (two years into his crime-fighting crusade), along with GCPD Lieutenant Jim Gordon, must solve his clues in order to put an end to the bloodshed, all the while uncovering corruption and lies kept hidden by the city's rich and powerful. Along the way, they encounter an intriguing cast of characters, including unlikely ally Selina Kyle, crime boss Carmine Falcone, and Oswald \"Oz\" Cobblepot aka the Penguin, Falcone's lieutenant and proprietor of the Iceberg Lounge nightclub. Every single member of the cast is incredible, with many of them becoming my personal favorite live-action adaptations of their respective character, such as Robert Pattinson's titular Dark Knight, who exudes a quiet intensity and is able to convey a multitude of emotions without speaking a word, and Colin Farrell's Penguin, who is utterly unrecognizable in the role and steals every scene he's in, to name a few. The film itself is captivating and incredibly well-paced despite having a nearly 3-hour runtime, and my eyes were glued to the screen throughout the entirety of it. One reason for this is the fact that \u2018The Batman' is easily the most beautifully-shot comic book movie I've ever seen, due to the exceptionally brilliant work of cinematographer Greig Fraser. I also have to give major praise to composer Michael Giacchino and production designer James Chinlund, whose music and sets elevated the film to a whole new level and filled me with excitement, suspense, and many more emotions. Overall, Matt Reeves and co. have proven that they truly understand the characters they're working with and have crafted a smart, gripping masterpiece set in a new Bat-universe which I'm incredibly eager to revisit as soon as possible and will hopefully continue for many years to come.",

His portrayal of Bruce Wayne isn't quite as perfect, but there is room to grow. A world-class cast including Paul Dano, Colin Farrell, John Turturro, Z\u00f6e Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright help elevate Matt Reeves' take on the Caped Crusader to heights that I confess I didn't expect. Sure, they took some liberties with the Riddler's origin and motives, but it doesn't matter. This is a very good movie.",

For once Gotham and the Caped Crusader were believable and engaging. \n\nI felt as if I was watching a crime drama with the detective tracking a serial killer. This detective just happened to dress in an intimidating bat costume (which was also more gritty and realistic), and had excellent, believable fighting skills. There were some great twists and surprises that made this story even more entertaining.\n\nThe sets, lighting, and music worked together seamlessly to pull me in to the world where Gotham City was real and corruption thrived. There were no campy costumes and Catwoman didn't purr like a cartoon villain. The criminals didn't have gimmicky lairs and even the Batcave came across as rugged and realistic. If I didn't know any better I would have thought someone dropped New York City in a dark Washington State during the rainy season.\n\nOverall I would name this the best Batman ever in both movies and television. The actors were believable, sympathetic, and I actually cared what happened to them. I'll admit when I heard Robert Pattinson was going to be the new Batman, I scoffed at the idea; but he proved me wrong. He turned out to be one of the best. I hope this franchise continues through many more films.",

            "content": "On first viewing, in the theater, I thought The Batman to be loud, long, and somewhat slow-paced. I found the slow motion scenes to be overly used and detracting from the story. I didn't love Andy Serkis as Alfred. Pattinson, though he had impressed me in his post-glampire appearances, was far from my first choices to don the cape. And DC has dropped one steaming turd after another in the past decade and a half as if a team of caffeinated tweens were running the entire WBfilm studios. \n\nBut ultimately I dismissed these as minor gripes, ate my popcorn, and somewhat enjoyed a sunday movie which I intended on quickly forgetting. \n\nBut I didn't forget it. I thought about...a lot. It bugged me that I liked it more than I wanted to, and I wanted to hate it. I got on YouTube to seek out scathing video reviews to help me feel better about wanting to hate it, there's PLENTY on there.  Which is when I happened on a YouTube video posted by the channel: Macabre Storytelling called \"Why The Batman is NOT a Batman Film\". ( https://youtu.be/tyRnkwo4Pds ) and it completely changed my mind. It gave such a fresh perspective that, in my haste to hate, had originally gone well over my head. After viewing the movie a second time, this time through the lens of perspective given by the video, I see The Batman as arguably the best Batman Film to date. \n\nThat slow pacing and those slo-mo shots no longer irked me. They drew me in to the emotional weight of the story, allowing me to soak in the surrounding atmosphere. Permitting me to experience a quiet moment in an otherwise chaotic City. Seeing Batman where he is between the angry kid from origin tales and the polished veteran crimefighter of later years...seeing him as a still confused young man in his coming of age tale, processing the results of his actions and seeing that he is a small part of the bigger picture...really resonated in a way that no other batman Film has done before. He had the power, but hadn't yet figured out the responsibility. He isn't Batman yet, he is just raw, and mostly blind, if not at least tone deaf \"vengeance\". \n\nPaul Dano's Riddler was chilling, haunting, and such a refreshing take on a character that has been too often cast as comic relief. Pattinson shined in a role where the one-dimensionality of the character is intentional. The real test will be in the (hopeful) sequel where he'll have the chance to spread his acting wings and we'll see his diversity as Batwayne. Zoe is a very strong actress, she shines here. And she's stunning in a role where she is comically undersized for. Her fight scenes, though well shot and very exciting, were a hard pill to swallow given her diminutive stature. But I was no less entertained. \n \nIt has subtly brilliant storytelling with some gorgeously choreographed violence, that often gets overlooked to the casual or average comic book movie fan. These \"fans\" watch for the action and the side humor (which has taken a far too comfortable front seat over in the MCU these days), and shun anything that could be mistaken for intelligence. With its attention to detail and depth of character rivaling Fincher himself, it's more a film, than a movie. And that, to some, is too high of a concept to comprehend. I can't help but give The Batman damn close to five stars. A not quite profound, but deeply appreciated pleasure to experience.",

            "content": "I have always been obsessed with Batman from an early age as I have watched the animated series, the Justice League series, Lego Batman and other Batman media content. As I grew up, I stopped watching Batman related media for a while until this movie released. Directed by Matt Reeves, The Batman 2022 is a reboot from the previous Batman films and this time, this movie depicts a more realistic Gotham city with a dark, noir and  detective style story of Batman who takes on the job of protecting Gotham city and when I mean by realistic, there are no superpowers and superhuman beings at all. Realistic scenarios, realistic hand to hand combat scenes, vehicles and the list could go on. This movie is very different from your usual action packed superhero films like the movies  Marvel would usually make. So, I suggest you turn back if you are one of those superhero movie fans that cares about action scenes and superpowers because you are going to witness something different.\n    The film itself is aesthetically pleasing and I mean it for the entire movie which I will explain more about later in this review.\n   The story takes place 2 years after The Batman publicized himself to Gotham city, a city with filled with corruption and crime. While keeping a lookout for the city, a serial killer named Riddler emerges and starts killing influential figures of Gotham city, whom all have  corrupt connections to each other and also leaving clues that leads up to an even greater conspiracy. Batman must solve all these mysteries and riddles in order to find out who the next target is, solve the conspiracy and put an end to the Riddler. Does he have what it takes to stop the Riddler?\nRobert Pattinson nails the role as Batman: a depressed and edgy caped crusader (this is what most people like to call him) who is scarred by the death of his parents 20 years ago caused by a group of criminals. He was able to capture the vibe of a dark and depressed person that Batman is: Does not talk much, blunt and an intimidating vigilante that the Batman is known for. He also played the other side of Batman as well, Bruce Wayne. When Bruce is not under his mask and suit, he is just a depressed billionaire who owns the Wayne enterprise and deals with public affairs and still as edgy as Batman. Robert Pattison was able to portray both Bruce Wayne and Batman very well. You can just look into his eyes and feel that dark and gloomy vibe.\n Supporting roles like the Cat woman (Zoey was spot on with the sassy attitude) and commissioner police Gordon were also done very well as they were able to show how it is like to partner up with Batman, who is stubborn, quiet and straightforward. Paul Dano as the Riddler was immaculate as he managed to play as a menacing and mentally deranged person who is just a normal human being that can cause disruption and violence in Gotham city. He showed off his performance even furthermore in the scene where he talks with Batman in Arkham Asylum.  Colin Farrell also brought the character Penguin to life with the accent and the personality which was spot on like the comics. The same exact thing could be said for the actor who played the crime boss Carmine Falcone. All the actors managed to bring the characters to life just by the way they talked in the movie. You could even feel the tension during the characters' conversations.\n\n  Cinematography in this movie is top tier. Some will think the camera work is too much, but I think that doing too much is what made the film beautiful. The still shots of Gotham city from different perspectives, still shots of the characters, the shots of Batman looking over Gotham city, the dark color palate used and especially the lighting the movies uses, it makes the film look and feel dark. The fight scenes' fast paced camera work was executed properly as it perfectly choreographed all the fighting moves and the camera follows the Batman while he performs all these fighting techniques making us feel the intense action.\nThe scene where Batman revs up his Bat mobile in the dark and reveals himself was one of the best cameras work, I have seen in my life. The way the engine lights up showing the flames, the full view of the Batmobile from all perspective, the terrifying engine sounds the Batmobile makes, it's just top tier. That moment was pure hype fuel.  I could feel that intimidating appearance of the Batmobile. The movie felt immersive due to its excellent camera work and cinematography.\n   The music and soundtrack used was a perfect fit for the impressive cinematography as the music enhanced every moment in the movie. Every fight scene and chase scenes felt intense due to the fitting soundtrack. You could even feel the tension between the characters conversations.\n However, the length of the movie felt unnecessary in my opinion. Sure, all the scenes were pretty, but some scenes could be cut out as it felt like it, they were not necessary for the movie's plot. With that time, they could have explored more areas of Gotham city or show more characters. Other than that, the movie is superb.\n   Overall, this Batman movie is a dark, gritty and realistic take on Batman and Gotham city with a fascinating psychological thriller story that will keep you asking many questions while watching the film. This film will not be for those who enjoy action packed superhero films as this movie have dark and depressing themes and the long length of the film might scare some people away. But try it out, see if you like it or not. I would recommend this movie to every Batman fans though. 4/5 stars movie and very excited for a sequel.",

I think most people who have gripes with how he portrayed the character (both Batman and Bruce Wayne) fail to realize that in the timeline, it is only his 2nd year fighting Gotham's crime. He is supposed to be young, angsty and emotional. He is still grieving over the loss of his parents after all. The movie does run a little long at 2:56:00, but that really doesn't take away from anything if you have an attention span longer than 25 seconds. Long, but an excellent film to establish the universe. That being said, I cannot wait to see what else Matt Reeves brings to the table!",

            "content": "\u2018Planet of the Apes' writer/director Matt Reeves directs Robert Pattinson in this stylish reboot of the caped crusader. Pattinson leads an A-list cast that includes Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano and Andy Serkis. Reeves delivers a masterclass in filmmaking, bringing a dark, gritty adaptation of Batman to the screen that leaves you wanting more as soon as the credits roll.\n\nWhen The Riddler (Paul Dano) begins his killing spree, targeting Gotham City's key political figures, billionaire Bruce Wayne is called into action donning the iconic cowl as he begins to investigate. As Bruce explores the deep-rooted corruption hidden behind some of Gotham's most well-known figures, the full scale of the sadistic serial killer's plan comes to light, forcing Bruce to question his past as he tries to save the city of Gotham and its people.\n\n\u2018Dune' cinematographer Greig Fraser adds to his stellar streak of work, providing \u2018The Batman' with sensational cinematography, creating a gothic feast for the eyes while also capturing the dark underbelly of Gotham City. Fraser's visuals allow for this film to be not only a visual spectacle, but also a thoroughly entertaining film. Much like James Mangold's \u2018Logan' or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, \u2018The Batman' positions itself as one of the darker superhero adaptations \u2013 both thematically and narratively, as well as visually. Acclaimed composer Michael Giacchino crafts a magnificent score for the film, creating an addictive mix of booming orchestral pieces and eerie choir pieces. Giacchino's new theme for the caped crusader, an intense and thundering piece of music will arguably go on to define the character for years to come.\n\nDespite the hefty near three-hour run-time, Matt Reeves ensures that audiences are kept on the edges of their seats and entertained throughout. Robert Pattinson slips effortlessly into the role as the iconic hero, giving a marvellous performance as an intimidating hero, and mysterious billionaire. Pattinson's performance leaves you eagerly anticipating for when the \u2018Twilight' star next dons the emblematic cowl, with a portrayal that manages to capture Batman's humanity so easily and subtlety.\n\nPaul Dano arguably gives the best performance of the film; crafting himself into a terrifying villain, lighting up every second of screen-time he gets. Dano and Pattinson's performances are accompanied by a slick turn as Selina Kyle/Catwoman from \u2018Big Little Lies' star Zo\u00eb Kravitz, who gives a brilliant performance as the feline anti-hero. However, Colin Farrell's unrecognisable turn \u2018The Penguin' can't help but feel like an unnecessary addition to the plot, coming off as a character who's only reason for being included was to set up the character's own HBO Max miniseries currently in the works.\n\nDespite being one of the best films of 2022 so far, \u2018The Batman' can't help but suffer from a few issues, including a disjointed third act that ultimately wins you over with a nail-biting final sequence and certain . Matt Reeves threads together a wide web of themes in \u2018The Batman' ranging from justice, corruption, to crime and greed. These complex themes come together to create a cryptic, intricate, and multi-layered story that keeps you on your toes, constantly guessing these character's next moves. \u2018Planet of the Apes' production designer James Chinlund and \u2018Spencer' costume designer Jacqueline Durran bring their respective talents together to create an immersive world that draws you into the crime-ridden streets of Gotham.\n\nMatt Reeves puts his spin on the iconic hero with Warner Bros. latest edition to their plethora of DC films. Driven by a cast that give marvellous performances throughout the three-hour run-time, \u2018The Batman' presents a much darker and mysterious version of the well-loved hero to audiences, inviting them to try and solve The Riddler's mystery alongside Bruce Wayne. The film does a stellar job of not only establishing new versions of these characters, but also sets up the future of Robert Pattinson's turn as Batman. Teasing new villains and exciting returns, \u2018The Batman' is sure to be a film that audiences will absolutely enjoy, whether you're a DC fan or not.",

If you never watched Seven (1995), do yourself a favor and go watch, one of the best thrillers/crime movies of all time. \nThe Batman movie tries to be dark and realistic, like Seven, and it is at times, but when it involves the main cast, some of the realistic approach is tossed aside or does not apply to them, it lacks consistency and can get annoying (specially the final battle/scene), you never really fear for Catwoman or Batman, because you always know they will be saved and the realistic rules shown don't apply to them. Also, it gets annoying that you are left with this feeling of \"there's too many ending scenes\", you think the movie is ending at least 4 times, something does not feel right.\nOverall, The Dark Knight (2008 - PG13) still the best Batman movie, being consistent, filled with great acting, music and story. The Batman (2022) is a 6.5/10 for me, it's a decent movie, passed the time, good acting, but not a great story, fell short on mystery/investigation, feeling too long (too many ending scenes opportunities) and lacks consistency on the dark/realistic approach.",

            "content": "The Batman does more right than wrong, but it's a touch overindulgent at very nearly 3 hours. This film, as anticipated, serves as a sort of showcase for an upcoming series of films, introducing several noteworthy names throughout the first chunk of the film. Catwoman, Penguin, The Riddler, and that's to say nothing of the less flashy but just as crucial Alfred Pennyworth or the Police Lieutenant, not-yet-Commissioner Jim Gordon. More characters work than do not, but it would have been nice to see a little development, especially for Paul Dano's transfixing take on The Riddler. Completely unhinged, but also calculating Dano's work as the deeply disturbed Edward deserved more screen time without his strange and haunting mask. This Riddler is nothing like the ones you've seen before, and Dano's take is certainly the best Batman villain since Heath Ledger's infamous offering. By the film's conclusion they do give him a backstory, but it's done in a real \"fly by\" sort of way. The backstory itself is nice and cookie-cuter neat so that it fits in the small window of time allotted for it. Ultimately it doesn't do the film's best character justice, but the performance is still commendable regardless. As for the rest of the cast, they do a fine job - no major complaints, but the film certainly does it's utmost to keep Batman onscreen by keeping Bruce Wayne off of it. While Pattinson does fine behind the cowl, his Bruce Wayne leaves something to be desired. Perhaps the most complete character in the film is Gotham itself. Here the backdrops are all dirty and unkempt, strewn with litter and soot. It rains more often than not here, casting the entirety of the city in a looming hopelessness that's almost palpable. It serves as a constant reminder of the mindset of the people who live there, surrounded by crime and wealthy exuberance, unsafe and too poor to combat the obvious corruption within Gotham's inner workings. This is perhaps best exemplified by John Turturro's transfixing take on Carmine Falcone, a well-known mob boss in Gotham city. Turturro, like Dano, doesn't get the screen time he deserves, but manages to do a lot with the limited time that he is allowed. The story represents a more detective-based approach that was often lacking a certain authenticity in Nolan's trilogy, which is quite welcome overall and it fills the lengthy runtime fairly well as The Riddler leads Batman all over Gotham chasing clues while playing a \"Saw-like\" game. Overall the package is entertaining enough to recommend, even if one has to clear an entire afternoon or evening to digest it all and the setup at the very end of the movie promises a sequel that could live up to the well-rounded entry we have here.",

Also what they did to riddler was just a sin he wasn't even riddler at that point because they tried to make him to realistic because riddler is not some psychotic serial killer he is supposed to be heavily narcissistic and just obsessed with proving he is smarter and better than batman not to mention the terrible design he, Catwoman, joker, and basically everyone in this movie suffered from.

I literally go into about 40min of the move and turn it off and play video games. The reason why this movie was so bad because Bruce Waynedid not feel like character it post to be. When I think of Bruce Wayne as a dc character. My mined pop up as a playboy, with a lot money. Also a strong business man who hold his family name proud, but with family trauma. With this new Batman, Bruce feel like goth kid. Who care about nothing, like just not feel right about character. When Bruce wear the Batman suit, it feel like not really like a Batman. Like that one scene where he walk in the street to going into a club. Wtf, no Batman would do that, he would give though the roof or a window and threat the big bad boss. Not fight in middle of club where people are dance. Also, his bat cave feel like a problem kid who does not care about life. Plus, is equipment feel like cheap. Then when introduced cat women, I was disappointed because the cat women did not look right to me. She look like person that struggle to make a living in Gotham City. When cat women should be a successful theft who steal very rich items. I do not even know how they mess up this character. Plus, do not get me started on James Gordon.  Those when I do think about James Gordon. I think of a guy who is smoking while drinking alcohol. Overall, I do not know how this move got such good review. Maybe these people never grow up with Batman or seen cartoon movies or read the comics books.",

The broody and contemplative Batman is balanced with a flirty and sensual Catwoman, and the villain in the Riddler is malign, twisted and sinister.\n\nThe Batman is a riveting start at Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson's iteration of the titular character, and should leave audiences wanting more from this Batman.\n\n9/10",

We get to see more Batman and way less Bruce, sacrificing the human factor in order to differ and impress, sitting in a strange spot where there's a lot to feel and at the same time you feel very little, where a powerful scenografy and solid direction are at the service of a bumpy script with very long downs and lots of smaller but refreshing ups. Both Andy Serkis and Paul Dano are brilliant but their glimmer ends up lost in a overly zealous script that somehows manages to miss the mark despite having all the right cards in all the right places.",

I also liked the possibility that his father Thomas Wayne, was possibly a bad person. I think that it adds to the story really well and is realistic, considering Thomas Wayne was an extremely rich person, you kind of have to be a bit ruthless to acquire that amount of wealth in the first place. I also liked how batman said to Selina that Anika getting killed was sort of her own fault because she got in with the wrong crowd. I think that him saying something like that was very realistic, considering he grew up very rich and privileged. I'm really excited to see the next movie and see how the story progresses, and hopefully we will get more info Batman's parents past as well. I do think it is a bad idea putting joker in the next movie though, because there has been so many live action portrayals of the joker recently. I hope that he is not the main villain in the next movie, and that they give another villain that we haven't seen before, a chance to be in the next movie.",

Very respectable if not flawed.\n\nThe movie doesn't reach heights of greatness attained by Chris Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" but is more on par with something like \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in my view. The movie is dark, very dark, as in visual tone, and it's obvious that wasn't a mistake by the director. Robert Patterson plays the part low-key, sad, and brooding.\n\nThe movie's main villain \"The Riddler\" is (no surprise) unhinged and depraved but very intelligent, played fantastically by Paul Dano. Dano plays the sociopath to perfection and is one of the highlights of the film.\n\nI enjoyed the main storyline for the most part with John Turturro as Carmine Falcone, Colin Ferrell (completely unrecognizable) as The Penguin and Zoe Cravitz does fine as Catwoman. I also can't forgot Jeffery Wright as Gordon, who does a great job and adds to the movie greatly.\n\nThe move in my opinion only suffers from one thing and that's bloat. The movie is 3 hours long and was trying to fit a whole lot in that 3 hours, which for the most part was OK because it was entertaining. However the movie would of benefited from a little less cramming and run time.\n\nAll in all if you're a Batman fan you definitely need to check it out. It's not an all-time great Bat-flick but its worthy of praise and and even if you're not a comic book fan a good thriller with some top notch performances.\nhttp://themoviepad.com",

I watched this movie in 4K today and it looked beautiful. The visuals matched the cinema experience. The cast of this movie is stacked with big names such as Robert Pattinson, Colin Farrell and Paul Dano! The best Batman movie I've ever seen, yes better than The Dark Knight in my humble opinion. The opening scene to this movie is still one of the best openings I've ever seen to a movie. The only downside to Robert Pattinson's Batman is his version doesn't give the Bruce Wayne side justice. Don't get me wrong his Batman is perfect as he embraces the detective side of Batman but I can't say the same about Bruce Wayne. Anyways I adore this film but it doesn't hold up the same way as the first watch does.

            "content": "There is no better way than to start 2023 than listening to Robert Pattinson mumble something about fear and vengeance to nobody at all again. Possibly the darkest interpretation of Batman we've ever had, and I don't think anybody is complaining. Matt Reeves takes inspiration from basically any David Fincher film you could think of to create a gripping and intense film that explores Gotham in a new way. Instead of creating an ultra-realistic city, like Christopher Nolan, or an ultra-cartoonish city like Tim Burton, Mett Reeves builds a dark and grim city - much like something out of Se7en. The Batman tears almost every layer of cartoonish fun away, and replaces it with psychological thriller and crime noir. And it pulls it off in magnificent fashion. While Pattinson's Bruce Wayne is not on the level of Christian Bale, his Batman strives to new lengths and achieves something nobody else could have done. His sombre and brooding performance as Batman stands out in a film full to the brim of outstanding performances.\n\nThe soundtrack adds to the moodiness of this film, with Nirvana's \"Something In The Way\" seemingly now the theme song of Gotham. It's hard to decide whether the use of that song is as good as the score though. We've always known Michael Giacchino is a master in his craft, but I have a feeling this could later become known as his magnum opus. An absolute robbery from the academy by the way. As I've said before, it's to decide whether this is actually better than The Dark Knight, but even if it isn't as good, it absolutely comes as close as anything else. The costumes and makeup department had their work cut out here, but they certainly delivered. The mix of CGI and practical effects absolutely works here, and I'm sure this will hold up many years from now. Despite being a new take on batman, this really is faithful to the comic books, bringing us the detective batman in a fresh light. Although this is set at the start of batman's career, it's not an origin story. As much as I like origin stories, this excels because Matt Reeves knows and accepts the people watching this as not stupid. No need to have flashbacks to Wayne's parents death - he knows that we already know what happened. The prime example of this is in one of the first scenes, when Batman is investigating a crime scene and he sees the son of the victim. All we needed was a sorrowful look and we understood his feelings.\n\nVerdict: \ud83c\udfc6 97%\nThe Batman achieves a new take on Gotham and the caped crusader, with one of the bleakest comic book films ever created. It's looks, sounds and feels like the detective thriller we were all excited for. At almost 3 hours long, it's certainly not a short outing, but its relentless nature never releases you from it's grip and somehow leaves you already impatiently waiting for a sequel.",

Instead, I caught it on a small, probably 7 inch screen mounted on the front seat in an eight hour economy flight to somewhere. I'd tell you, THAT was a pretty bad experience. AND I don't mean the economy seats OR the bad resolution on the screen. Firstly, it was a VERY LONNNNNNNNNNNNNNG movie of non-stop action, explosion and of impossibility. I'm sure watching it on the big screen will bring the \"explosions\" and \"action\" more to life, BUT I wasn't disappointed with those. I had pretty low expectations before I caught this in the flight. I just didn't expect it to be THAT BAD...\n\nSee, story telling is very important. Not every reboot needs an origin story, I AM FINE with this one not having an Origin story. What I DO WANT is some originality in story telling. \n\n\"But hey Dude, there's nothin' wrong with a little copying of a good formula, eh?\"\n\nIt came across as too much of a The Dark Knight wannabe, plots after plots, explosions after explosions, madness after madness..... But let me share WHY \"The Dark Knight\" is on whole different universe of quality (Chris Nolan aside). It has layers to it, development of the story. The Joker didn't single-handedly set all his plans RIGHT AT THE GET GO. He had to create layers of chaos, destroy many people and groups to grow his legend and force the mob to bend to his will and work with him. And Bruce Wayne/Batman had to burn bridges and be as ruthless as him in order to defeat The Joker and save Gotham, and then some,.... became an Outcast at the end. It was good story telling and Heath Ledger was so convincingly MAD, CHAOTIC and EVIL that he'd give you nightmares for weeks.\n\nThe Batman on the other hand, gave you a SUPPOSED same level genius, madness and chaos in The Riddler. Sure, they introduced many other characters from the Original Batman comic stories, but they were shallow, without much focus or character development. AND the real problem was... The Riddler ALREADY had ALL his plot and plan in place BEFORE the movie even began. It was ALL plotted, disaster equipment ALREADY IN PLACE, and BOOM!, no one knew and no one came close to discover anything until everything has happened, and if The Riddler haven't already planned it to be caught, no one would even discover who he is. and Boom, BOOM, BOOOOOM! Layers after layers of chaos happening one after another without so much as a development to HOW those Chaos came about. ALL ALREADY IN PLACE. And grand finale of another 30 minute of chaotic fight sequence where The Batman with very little help defeats all the baddies. \n\nIn The Dark Knight, many things had to happen to lead to its conclusions, for example, the Ferry portion, where the the people of Gotham CHOSE not to kill the other, not to pull the trigger and leave the destruction if any to the perp, not falling into The Joker's plan. In The Batman, it's just boom, Boom, BOOM.... no control whatsoever, such shallow PLOT development. \n\nI think t he biggest sin is that they TRIED SO HARD to be The Dark Knight, but in my book, failed miserably. Also, I don't like OR dislike the actors/artists in this movie. I KNOW WHO they are, but have neither positive nor negative feel about them. They sort of played the character \"Well\" I guess, but nothing stood out. They also seem to lack chemistry, to me. Had The Batman NOT PRETEND to be The Dark Knight so hard, instead gone with another method, perhaps I would've enjoyed it more. Hence even more, not one to be watch on a flight.",

It took a while to hook me in but by hour 2, I was there. \n\nRobert Pattison is a decent, grunting Batman, Jefrey Wright a serviceable Gordon, Zoe Kravitz an incredible (as in, not remotely credible)  Catwoman and Andy Serkis (again!) is a Cockney Aflredo. They are used well. But it is a villains movie with the unrecognisable Colin Farrell as the Penguin (why???), John Torturro as Carmine Falcone (wonderful) and Paul Dano (steals the last 30 minutes) as the Riddler that make it worth watching. I won't give away the plot, but the Riddler is 4 steps ahead of everybody including Batman, and he is the reason the plot is over complex and yet delivers. \n\nThe writer/director Reeves establishes his own murky world and somehow pulls this off. Tonally, it is more The Joker than Dark Knight and if it was 30 minutes shorter and a tad brighter in look and dialogue (a struggle sometimes) this would be one of the best Batman films.

The intermingling of superhero and and Goodfellas style mafia drama was also unexpected. The Batman is by no means a perfect movie and it has its weak parts, such as the plot being quite linear and neither Batman himself, Zo\u00eb Kravitz in her role as Catwoman or any of the villains being all that memorable. Will we remember Paul Dano as The Riddler in 20 years time, or Colin Farrell as the Penguin? Perhaps not is the answer, as much as I was dumbfounded upon first finding out that Farrell was actually the Penguin. Having said that, there is a certain flow to the movie that kept me enthralled and engaged, and this feeling only increased as the flicked got closer to its climax, and this is the reason for the 3.5 star rating.",

This film has little premises on Nolan's take, strictly for the lazy soundtrack, writing and character development arc. I'm rich so I can build a super car, I'm rich so I'm a super fighter. The painful lack of merit to ability leaves a hollow emo character who can't present a tangible reason for why he did what he did and why, apart from the fact that he's spiteful and ungrateful. Or even present a reason to be liked by the audience. \n\nAs a rule of thumb I believe the batman should display some kind of signal of hope, a struggle of redemption, someone who doesn't take advantage of what we know to display his strengths, instead leading by example in the mysterious dark ways of his own individual battle with morality. \n\nThis portrayal lacks in that and lacks in the role model aspect just as much. \n\nPerhaps if the movie was 40 minutes shorter, specifically while Batman is holding the flare and leading the people through the flooded arena, boom, perfect cut, movie over.  6/7--10 maximum",

And then there is another scene with the same thing later. \nThe villains appear to be pretty much from the Nolan movies just a bit different, which could be a good thing. Compared to most of the characters, the Penguin is at least likable, even funny at times. Also, the riddler's cast appears to be a great choice with his weired smiley child like face but then the character just drowns within the mediocrity of the rest of the movie and his own flat story. The heroes, portrayed by good actors, appear boring, flat and I could not care less about any of them. The movie very much lacks chemistry between the characters. \nThe car chase was at least entertaining - with probably a high collateral body count for a hero who does not kill - and ending in a cinematic eye candy upside down shot in the end. \nThe rest of the movie however just seems like a person with brain injuries who wants to tell you something but forgot how to speak. So you keep waiting patiently for three hours. I believe the movie tries hard, too hard. I think it wanted to be somewhere between The Dark Knight and Silence Of The Lambs, but then was stuffed with way too many unconnected chunks of story, that all feel like you have seen them before, and finally hardly becomes a movie of its own.",

He's a guy in a suit pretending to be riveting but only delivering heavy handed soliloquies to characters as vacant as himself. His villain is as lost, and only shows himself to be less riveting than the score and stage he's set upon. The highlight of the film is a scene that depicts an explanation of a world we feel little about. With a song by Nirvana, a band we seldom recognize but should give praise where it's due. That scene is 20min's in, and trust me, it goes down hill from there. The exposition of characters here is starkly exasperated, trying so much more than the simple plot they play along. You may find yourself unimpressed and falling asleep at what's supposed to be a riveting version of your favorite masked super. I found myself wondering \"Why would you decide to do THAT there when you could've done THIS there?\".\nUltimately void of vision, yet pretty to watch die, The Batman fails to meet expectations.

Yet with this film, we are miles and miles away from Tim Burton's goofy, gothic iteration of the iconic caped crusader. And perhaps that's where this movie falters. It is a little bit too committed to its tone. It is all darkness, without a speck of light. And while that ambition is respectable, ultimately it lacks the much needed levity of Burton and Nolan's films. \n\nThe character development of the titular hero is also severely lacking. We find out little about him at all, other than the fact that he is like a My Chemical Romance version of Bruce Wayne and a very inexperienced, more vulnerable presentation of the character we know and love.\n\nPaul Dano absolutely crushes this uncharacteristically frightening take on The Riddler. \n\nAnd the movie is far too long and meandering. \n\nSo it is an ambitious, respectable start but it is seriously flawed and a little too committed to its crushingly macabre atmosphere.",

He did what he could. Shot primarily during lockdown (where most filmmakers thought they didn't have to follow sheep) and came out well. Edited in was loads of rain and nightfall, where they struggled with the pace and conviction was when the rain wasn't bouncing. Perhaps nobody noticed. Just think was sloppy in places and a bit flat. They depended too much on the editing. Hope the next one offers more, less flashing lights and not overly fixated on some strange character who gained fame like many through the internet trolling.",

I'm glad I did not pay to see this movie in the theaters (watched it on HBO Max).

I think that the Batman movies that try to be silly are better than the ones that try to dark and edgy. The LEGO Batman Movie is hilarious and I re-watch it all the time. This movie however is very good. The cinematography is beyond incredible. The music is awesome. The acting is beyond compare. The scene directing is just perfect. When Batman first came in, I truly felt like something amazing was happening before my eyes. It was so powerful. This film actually does dark and edgy well. The shots are just memorable, and I still remember them. The story is written pretty well, while still having flaws. But overall this film does so much that excites you. I walked out of this theater and immediately knew what my new favorite superhero movie was. I highly recommend you to watch this movie. My only large complaint is that Robert Pattinson, does an Oscar worthy performance as Batman, but a pretty bad job as Bruce Wayne. This can also just be the writing but at least Bruce Wayne is in the movie for like 20 minutes so it's not that bad. Paul Dano is fantastic in this movie and when he is on screen I do genuinely get scared and uneasy. It is an easy 5 star.",

Other fantastic performances would be Colin Farrell as the penguin and Jeffrey Wright as Jim Gordon along with Paul Danno with his new iteration of the Riddler is truly terrifying. \nA few negatives I would give the film would be that I felt it was a tad to long and they could have cut out possibly 10 to 15 minutes, and I also feel that the film overall was too dark in color I really felt there should've been a few more shots of some light but other than the length of the film and over all color of the film The Batman is a damn near perfect Batman movie and definitely the best iteration of the character we have gotten in many years.",
