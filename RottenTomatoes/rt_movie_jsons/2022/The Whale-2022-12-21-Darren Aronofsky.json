            "content": "This movie was a gorgeous exploration of the isolation and desperation in human suffering. Aronofsky's movies frequently revolve around these themes, and this is one of his easiest to absorb and one of his best. Due to a lot of high profile backlash against Brendon Fraser playing the role of a morbidly obese man rather than a real obese person being cast in the role, I was prepared to be potentially offended, but upon seeing the movie I was actually astonished that anyone would cast fault upon such a sincere and loving portray as Fraser offered. This is an exceedingly sensitive and beautiful acting, and I actually wonder if the detractors even saw the film, or just reacted in unthinking \"wokeness\" to word of its existence. This is as good as anything  released by a major studio in the last 10 years, which might be called the Marvel and Reboot Era. It's no longer even a debate that Hollywood has for years sacrificed its relevance and vitality on a pyre of lowest-common-denominator audience pandering, and I had begun to wonder, I think fairly, if movies of real quality and meaning would ever be made again. Aronofsky's career nicely tracks the rise and fall of the indie cinema over the past 30 years, beginning with the supremely underground surprise pop hit of Pi, made of $60k in 1998, which grossed $3 million. It was then closely followed by a wave of big studio support which resulted in Requiem for a Dream two years later, made for $4.5M and distributed by Artisan Entertainment two years later, which succeeded in expanding his range of audience appeal without sacrificing a drop of artistic cred. The Whale makes a strong case for Aronofsky as one of the very few filmmakers working today with nearly the same artistic integrity as was regularly present in the mid to late 90's indie wave. Is it every bit as daring and bold as Requiem, Black Swan, or Pi? My sense is that those movies had more grit to them, they had a greater capacity to disturb, that The Whale is perhaps more smoothed-out, less alienating, and more ready for a broader audience. This does not really bother me, although I can understand why indie cool kids might consider it \"soft\" by comparison, even if it will still prove too challenging for many viewers. I'll disclose that I feel this sort of film student thinking is much ado about nothing. But whatever one's position on the position of grit in relation to authenticity, in terms of the ability to speak and make meaning from film, The Whale is surely the equal of Aronofsky's best work. Really a surprising, moving, and ultimately uplifting movie that broadens our capacity to be human and boldly confirms that great film is not dead.",

I love food and even though I've never been morbidly obese, I've had binge eating issues and weight control issues in life. Critics said the binge eating scenes were distasteful but how could they ever say that if they never tried the food? Those scenes are so shocking and graphic that I dunno how anyone could be triggered to binge eat from seeing this movie. Fraser deserved the Oscar gold and the surrounding cast was great.",

The young adult child who is still spinning in a loop of anger that her dad abandoned her for his lover when she was eight. Foaming at the mouth with self-pity. The angry ex, who turned to drink when she discovered her husband was bi-sexual. The exasperated nurse who scolds, then cries, scolds then cries. And here we go again with another teacher, who just wants his students to break out in some way and be 'honest' - be honest and the world will open up to them, he tells them. Haven't we had enough of this sort of thing in Good Will Hunting and other, lesser movies? \n\nThe redemptive angle was also far too on-the-nose, what with this doubting young man who appears out of nowhere like a doubting angel claiming he wants to 'save' Charlie. It's almost hilarious, but where's the irony? And then the ending, with Charlie making these elephantine, yet triumphant steps towards his daughter hanging by the open doorway, launches us into opera, an almost narcotic experience, which, admittedly, is perhaps not surprising when you remember director Aronofsky's brilliant early film, Requiem For A Dream, that takes us inside the heads of heroin addicts for 90 minutes or so. \n\nI enjoyed The Whale, for sure, even as it made me nearly gag at times, (Charlie stuffing his face with pizza, for instance), but this was an opportunity to say something more about a health system and a culture that allows people to gorge themselves for so long they can't even bend over to pick up something they dropped on the floor. And it was a missed opportunity, to my mind. Too many moments of sappy tears and raised voices, not enough grit and irony.",

            "content": "I watched the movie for the first time last night, and it dawned on me it's one of the most misunderstood movies that many of the critics missed the point of even when it's literally right in your face. Maybe critics need to read more books than just watch movies.\n\nTo start I saw the rotten tomatoes score of 66% by critics and was almost not going to watch it I read reviews of it being overhyped, but then Brendan Fraser won the Oscar and 91% audience score I said now I have to watch it! And it was one of the best movies I have ever seen.\n\nThe film is all about Moby Dick (another title for Moby Dick is The Whale) and Ellie's interpretation of it. The movie starts off with Thomas reading the essay and it saying \"and I felt saddest of all when I read the boring chapters that were only descriptions of whales, because I knew that the author was just trying to save us from his own sad story, just for a little while.\" Which is a bit of a foreshadowing of the the rest of the film. But the film is about Thomas being Captain Ahab trying to kill the whale (save Charlie from damnation) and Charlie is Moby Dick. But because Charlie is so fat we of course associate him with Moby Dick but Charlie is also Captain Ahab and he tries to kill his whale (get to know Ellie). Ellie is also Captain Ahab as she literally wishes Charlie would die just as Ahab wishes Moby Dick would die. The saddest and boring chapters would be only a description of Charlie, him by himself and him eating himself to death, and Thomas, Liz and Ellie comes in to save you from the sad story for a while. At one point Ellie even tells Thomas he finally feels he's interesting once she gives him the opportunity to tell his story, just like Charlie told her if you give reading a chance he felt she would actually like it, just like he feels if Ellie gives people a chance she could actually like them. Captain Ahab only sees Moby Dick as a whale he wants to kill and forgets animals can have feelings and be complex characters that would be better off left alone, just like Thomas forgets Charlie is an older man who has lived a long life and has his own story, in the end Thomas admits he finds him disgusting and just wants to save him for his own benefit and doesn't have Charlie's best interest in mind, seeing him as just an animal, just a whale. Ellie also sees Charlie as disgusting as just an animal but not because of his weight but because he left her for someone else. But when Charlie tells Ellie about why he left, she remembers he's human and not Moby Dick not just a whale but a human with feelings. Charlie tells Thomas he's already read his book which refers to the Bible but also Moby Dick and he feels that Ellie's essay of her interpretation of Moby Dick is the best writing he's ever read because it's just so honest. Ellie then confronts Thomas, just as she confronts Captain Ahab with her essay, she is honest with Ahab and with Thomas and by doing so releases Thomas from his own feeling he can't go home without killing the whale. Thomas then becomes Ishmael just as Ellie and Charlie become Queequeg, since Thomas and Ellie no longer see Charlie as an animal he is no longer Moby Dick, and becomes a human character. Just as Ishmael in Moby Dick is someone who sees Queequeg at the beginning of the story as basically a heathen or an animal, then by the end of the story sees them as the most caring and kind people they've ever know, just as he saw Charlie as someone who is disgusting and Ellie as a problem child but there is so much more to them than meets the eye. Charlie always sees Ellie as Queequeg, a caring person, even when her mom or Thomas didn't see her that way because Charlie always sees the best in people. In the end Ellie's writing released Thomas to go home, her writing releases Charlie as well, the ending she reads her essay and says \"This book made me think about my own life, and then it made me feel glad for my--\" this is left for interpretation of the viewer, whether she says she is glad for \"myself\" would make Charlie happy that she does love herself, or whether she says she is glad for her \"dad\" either way he knows he did something right with his life, and that's all he wanted.\n\nAlso I saw some people write that if you movies that are just in one room then you'll like this movie, well Moby Dick is just set in one place also, the sea. There is also a point where Ishmael finally sees Captain Ahab who was locked in his quarters and is scared of him, like when Dan finally sees Charlie.",

A culpa q seu companheiro carregava nao é muito bem explorada, se seria depressão pela rejeição da família e da igreja, ou o fato de ter largado tudo e todos para ficar com o grande amor e não ter se sentido preenchido. Enfim, ótimo filme!! Atuação impecável de todo elenco.",

Besides the acting and boringly simple plot, the directing and production leave much to be desired.

There's no deeper meaning to this than say Mother, another film criticizing religion and taking the all too obvious path of saying the same ol things at the enormous cost of film production. Frankly, I am disappointed so many people choose to address this subject with film as some flimsy art form cover up for their disliking of an ancient practice that has more than sunk itself with its own actions. But yet, here we are again. Another film pointing out our own faults and personal salvation or ruin. Highlighting the faults and idiocy of religion while also reflecting on its surface value for those who need it. The whole existence of the daughter in the film is a reflection of that. We're all her. But we don't have to be... It's not my thing, but it is well done. I don't particularly suggest watching it, but if you are one of those people who like obvious messages convolutedly buried in grim films, then this is probably right up your alley.

Unfortunately, it includes an ingredient that is both tasteless and (appearently) non negotiable in Hollywood culture these days. It includes an element of Christianity that starts off innocent, even convincing, only to subvert you by having the message of the movie come against it in order to villainize it. \nInterestingly in this film, it took away from the power it could have otherwise had the potential to have. Not only did they miss an opportunity for him to find peace with God as part of his redemption, but Charlie held onto his bitterness toward him until the end, and in turn, diminishing the message of his story. Additionally, the characters spend so much runtime fighting God, despite how they feel about him, that you can feel the precious hours slipping away from Charlie's life, while they alL continue to indulge in their contempt. They try to give the characters some context by giving them an in depth history with the church, but these characters' attitudes for people who have \"read every pamphlet\" or the entire Bible multiple times are outlying at best.\nIn other words, the shoehorned anti-christian message is inaccurate, unecessary, and the reason why this film was good, but not great, and certainly not a masterpiece.\n...Which is a shame, because other than that, all the other elements, the characters, the acting, writing, editing, pacing, score, are all excellent.",

            "content": "This movie was truly a rollercoaster that kept spiraling downwards, in the best of ways.  I was shocked by the state that Charlie was in and every single character was easy to empathize with.  This movie made me cry multiple times because I knew what would happen, but it was the painful journey that was most important.  This movie is a wonderful tragedy about the sickness of food addiction and it left me speechless throughout.  The writing was phenomenal and the acting made everything realistic.  With how common obesity is in America, it was easy to relate to in some way, and I think everyone will think \"I know someone whose obese,\" when they see this film.  I think this was one of the best movies I've seen this year because it made me feel and care about what was happening.  Now, the reason I gave this film 4.5 stars is because there was one incredibly important moment that quite literally shut my waterworks down.  This was the very ending.  Charlie had just succeeding in reconnecting with his daughter and helping her realize just how precious she is, all while on the verge of death and walking without help for the first time in a long time.  The music swells, the moment intensifies as Ellie and Charlie stare at each other, and right when I'm about to cry, his feet lift from the ground in a symbolic death and salvation from his tragic life.  Charlie ends up on the beach, in the moment he loves so much, in heaven.  And then the movie ends.  It is when the spiritualistic death took place, where he is literally lifted from the ground, that I stopped crying.  The movie has been so real, so solid, so down to Earth, that it felt supernatural and preachy when Charlie goes to heaven.  If the music cut and his heart went flat or he exhaled his last breath and the screen went white with credits, I would have started sobbing.  Charlie said he didn't want there to be an afterlife, he stated his opinions over and over again, so in a way, the film goes against his characters wishes by giving him the after life.  And if the moment at the beach isn't his heaven, but him reliving his life as it flashes over his eyes, then that would be too repetitive.  After all, the entire movie is spent exploring his life, the choices he's made, and how he lives in his last few days.  This should have ended tragically, very much like how Shakespeare ends his tragedies.  It should have been devastating to see or hear Charlie die, but instead, it seemed the producers wanted to give him a happy ending.  When a story is purely tragic, I do not want to see a happy ending.  I want the bittersweet ending of him finally making amends for his mistakes only to die a moment later, unable to ever see how his daughter will grow or see her smile.  I do not think he ever saw her smile as a teenager.  And that would have added another layer to his tragic life and death.",

We are not hateful. We are not to judge.

Brendan Fraser acts so well (along with the entire supporting cast) and the emotional drama and character archs from everyone in the movie are spectacles. It sends a profoundly powerful message and I think that this is the kind of movie that needs to exist, especially for individuals who have a hard time finding their place in life or who struggle from trauma. I liked that this movie took a big risk casting a non-obese person as an obese person. It still worked and some of the people who criticize the production for that never even checked out the movie to begin with or gave it a chance! It is so much more than an actor who portrays someone struggling with obesity, but instead struggling with the legacy of his turbulent and draining life in his final days, and what an incredible and original direction the movie went in with that!

The viewer watches him spiral hopeless to help him, only able to observe as he eats himself to death and this helplessness can be fustrating for some who view Charlie's problem as an easy fix - stopping eating.

This film reminded me of it so much of it. Secondly, if knowing the end was not motivation enough to stop watching, the film forces the audience to see how this man hurt himself and others in an unending orgy of passive-aggressive self-pity. He lies, he cheats. He is beyond redemption but we should like him and be empathic and still watch him kill himself hated by everyone around him.\n\nRegarding the award-winning performance of Mr. Fraser, it reminded me of Madonna's Evita - it was difficult to know where the Evita character began and Madonna's persona ended. I don't know Mr. Fraser, I have liked some of his films and always considered his different characters one-note. This character is different in that beauty is taken away from him and there is a defined attempt to bring real depth to Charlie. However,  I don't think is achieved. I am left with the distinct impression that what we saw was not Charly but Frase's deep, unfiltered, and untreated resentment toward his life. \n\nBest luck next time.",

Previous Aronofsky movies? Dunno. \nWhat I saw, what I experienced, was human tragedy. Yeah, it's hard to watch.",

Pity, relief, repulsion, grief or just a lot of sadness: when you leave the theather after watching \"The Whale\", at least one of these feelings has hit your stomach and remains there until you go to sleep. It's difficult to talk about this film without mention the terrific interpretation of Charlie, an overweight and dying (over 250kg) online teacher, by Brendan Fraser (awarded at the Oscars with Adrien Morot, the head between his makeup), for the first time in years acting in a leading role poignant and challenging to bring on screen. His character becomes more and more disgusting frame after frame until the dreamlike last sceen, where the white explodes and swallows every other color, completely opposite to the opening one, where a progressive zoom in the black reveals the title and his face. Director Darren Aronofsky though doesn't limit the script to a documentary about a week in the life of a morbidly obese and explores his story since he left his family (his wife and his son, Ellie, when she was 8) for one of his student, Alan, which died short after in misterious circumstances. Alan's sister, Liz, a nurse, is the only one left for him until Ellie starts visiting him (she is now 16 years old). Except the appeareance oh his former wife, there's only one other character on stage: it's Thomas, a missionary of New Life church that tries to save him before the end of times. Aronofsky deserves the credits for creating a very complex character (and this is the proper case to say it) behind his fatness, managing to keep us from falling into total pity. But, on the other hand, I think this movie is too smart, like if it was made at 90% for the Oscars, to go without doubts on best actor (see Di Caprio's Revenant). Extremely significant the theme of Moby Dick.",

He shows faith in people where others were not so kind, even through an uneasy watch of his last few days he shows positivity and strength where most give up.\n\nMy honest opinion is that this movie needs to be looked at with an emotional response, it's not meant for everyone but it's truly a great movie.",

The almost irredeemably savage nature of the supporting characters is relentless, and it compounds the sense of alienation and claustrophobia of being trapped in the belly of the whale. Depending on your emotional response, this can be a challenging film to watch, but it all draws to a thoroughly cathartic conclusion at the end, leaving nothing to be desired.\n\nI don't like the idea of describing this film from a technical aspect, as it's more of an existential experience, but: the directing is excellent.

Frazier is doing such a great job, and his scene partner is not in more than one case. \n\nI'ts 2 hour runtime never felt boring to me, and even tho this story has been done before, albeit different addictions than food, i liked how they kept you interested with the mystery of figuring out what happened to Charlie's partner, and trying to figure out who's essay it was. \n\nI remember when this movie was getting debuted, people were saying they should have cast someone actually that size instead of frazier lol. So fucking stupid now that i've seen the movie. He was so large that he could barely move around his apartment, and couldn't stand up on his own without assistance. Did people really expect there could be someone that size out there that could travel to a movie set every day, and deliver an academy award winning performance like Frazier did? Idiots",

The protagonist of this story is Charlie, a dangerously overweight individual who has suffered in isolation from the world after a tragic loss of the love of his life.\nWhile attempting to be a bright light to those around him and make up for lost time with his estranged daughter, Charlie ignores his own health concerns.\nWe follow an impactful journey that leads us to an extremely dark place in the mind of someone who is truly wrestling with demons that many of us could not understand, an obesity that lies in self hatred and punishment as well as a way to cope with the pains of his past. Sadie Sink one could say is the antagonist of this story, Her Character Ellie gives a very dark reminder of the sins of Charlie's past and shows the true pain caused and an everlasting effect that his choices made. A confused and resentful character who appears throughout the story to have a deep rooted hatred for her father and who wants to torment him for abandoning her as a young child. Ellie is a very misunderstood teenager who is in her own way crying out to be rescued from herself and it appears that her father may be the only key to this. \nA movie that is shadowed in pity, anger, confusion yet somehow delivers a truly peaceful ending that allows a sense of completion to Charlie's initial goal. \nThe whale is one that should be experienced, however tragic and confronting it may be.",

Many of them seem incapable of recognizing that the theme of the movie isn't about empathy, compassion, and understanding. It is rather a tale of love, mistakes, honesty, and most of all acceptance. \n\nLooking at the ratings from critics and viewers it's very clear who was placing expectations and judgement before the film was even over. The critics have so much to say about the audacity of displaying a very big fat man in the state of living as a very big fat man. As if this is some crime to shine a light on the reality of someone living in this way. 'Charlie\" near the end of the film mentions the rashes, fungus, and infections that any body in this state does actually experience. But him hogging out on a pizza is too much for the critics. What a reprehensible view of being a morbidly obese!\n\nThis is a good movie and it is easy to spot it's adaptation from a theatrical play, and I actually enjoyed that. There is a quick pace lunacy of entry and exit that happens. The plot was precise and to the point. It's a bottle movie, and it makes sense with the main character having a hard time getting 20ft to  his own bed.\n\nI felt a connection to the aspects of almost every character that I could identify within my own habits and past choices. It said something about my problems and my issues and how I can better deal with them: faith, fear, anger, blame, shame, silence  and love to name a few. \n\nThis is a good movie even if it's not about an actual whale.

Brendan Fraser all but quit Hollywood years ago and it took a Script by A24 to bring him out from the freezer. Brendan Fraser gives the performance of a Lifetime.\n\nBrendan plays a very obsese Reclusive man named Charlie who teaches College students via web cam. Although Charlie keeps his web cam off for fear of embarrassment due to his size and predicament. Charlie only has one friend and that's co star Hong who plays Liz Charlie's only friend who helps him with his daily tasks, basically a on stand by Nurse. Charlie is on the last week of his life as he is going into Congestive Heart failure due to his massive size. On his last week of his life he speaks with his daughter whom he abandoned 8 years prior. \n\nThis film is about redemption, Brendan also won a few awards and has given multiple speeches since this film's release. This is a MUST see even if you do not like drama or depression inducing films, this film will make even the strongest of movie goers cry. I'm not a crier when it comes to film and there's only been a handful of films that have made me just a little teary eyed. This film made me go all the way. This film brought me to my knees, I cried like a baby as I can relate, I'm a big guy NOT as big of course as charlie, I'm 302 and that's only because it's winter and I always gain 20 pounds in the winter due to not doing much so I'll be down to 270 280 by summer but man this will bring the strongest of persons to their knees. Brandon gives it his all, such a beautiful film, Don't get me started on M.s Sadie oh my word she is a rising star, She is going places, she is lighting up our screens, can't wait to see what she does next",

The performances of the others, perhaps caused by their cluncky over-explanatory scripts, detracted from the storyline, and world that the film was trying to depict. \n\nIn each case, I could feel good performances from the fine cast of support actors were bursting to get out, but they were stilted by a directorial style exemplified by the number of times actors went to leave the house and then stopped to turn around at the front door - presumably a lever to indicate a change in the relevant character's viewpoint.\n\nThe whole thing felt like a filmed stage play.\n\nBut the director and crew are to be congratulated for attempting the subject matter, it can't have been an easy sell to backers - at no point did I want to stop watching..",

I empathise with those responsible for Brendan Frasers Oscar nomination as I felt his acting was outstanding throughout. The characters in the film revolve Charlie, who is played by Brendan, and introduces 5 other characters who revolve around his story. I wouldn't say Brendan exactly carried the performance though as the whole cast were top notch. However, the film has received some negative feedback, and this may be the reason this film has not acquired the rotten tomatoes score one would assume it deserves. That is because it touches on the 'stigmatising reflection of thin peoples assumptions of fat bodies'. I don't buy into this as a criticism myself. I would agree that the film was emotionally provoking and made me feel uncomfortable or at at least uneasy at times. However, I do not think that the film was shallow in this sense. It is a fictional character, with a fictional storyline and with a over-fantasised and extremely animated displays of Charlies resignation in self-help and abandonment of aspirations as a consequence of his life choices and circumstances. I would say that if you are genuinely getting offended by this film and the topic therein then I would suggest creating a masterpiece like this one, exercise your own freedom of expression by shining a light on the issues, systematic or otherwise inferred in the criticisms. The film is supposed to make you feel uncomfortable, invite you to empathise, detest and sympathise for the characters. It's cinema, and cinema at its finest, the choice of how you respond to the movie will be personal and individual and I think that's what makes it so great. No one will watch this film and take away the same message as the person watching it with you. that's the point of it. It's a must see. Enjoy it.",

This one role probably showed twice the range and 3 times the emotion than I've seen from him in any other 2 roles he's ever done combined.

The Whale is a feature film directed by Darren Aronofsky (Mother, Black Swan), as part of the cast we have Brendan Fraser (Charlie), Hong Chau (Liz) and Ty Simpkins (Thomas) and Sadie Sink (Ellie). The feature film shows the daily life of a writing/English teacher living in prison due to severe obesity who tries to reconcile with his teenage daughter in a single chance of redemption.\n\nA Baleia is an adaptation of a play, I believe that is why people enter and leave the scene as if they were on a theater stage for everyone to connect with Charlie, right at the beginning of the project we are presented with our protagonist's routine, and issues controversies are already shown here regarding Charlie's health, how his self-esteem and sexuality are presented, the critics get heavy trying to accuse the director of portraying the character as if he were a circus character, however, the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) disagreed and told Franser to keep doing what he's doing.\n\nThis film shows practically everything I studied in the Physical Exercise Prescription discipline for special groups, the feature film shows joint/biomechanical difficulties, cardiovascular complications, psychological and aesthetic issues and with all this Brendan manages to deliver an extremely memorable and captivating performance, not no wonder he's running for an Oscar with his co-star Hong Chau, and Frase's choice for the role was spot on, anyone who knows a bit about the actor's history should agree.\n\nAnd finally, it is important to say that the name of the film A Baleia is not just because of Charlie's condition, and for you to understand the title, watch the film, because, I will not be the one to explain.",

I've seen it all before.\n\nI think it over emphasised his physical weight in order to try to depict disgust to the point of him feeling like a caricature. His acting was decent but lacked subtlety. It didn't properly touch on why he has given up on himself when he seemingly is intelligent, somewhat positive and wants to get to know his daughter more. There could have been flashbacks to some more foundational moments of his life to really humanise how he has become the way he is. Worst movie I've seen this year although this year I saw Banshees, Tar, The Menu, Cloud Atlas, Enter the Void and Everything Everywhere all of which I think were more interesting.",

The film struggles however with its lack of subtlety- offering a fairly predictable and coerced storyline and a flair for the dramatic, especially on Charlie's obesity. Charlie's obesity is a prominent component to the imagery of the film, but does not contribute much to the underlying message. The film tries to tackle too many tough topics (eating disorders, broken parent-child relationships, religion and homosexuality) while not fleshing them all out. Also, the films overt desire for drama (akin to a soap opera at times, and especially Sink's role) takes away from some of these deeper topics under the surface - not allowing the viewer to think critically of all viewpoints. The human condition is preposterous to behold - but the Whale tries to feed it to us on single-view, silver spoon.",

Hong Chau played the shit out of her role, the strength and vulnerability she was able to put into the role was just great.\nSadie Sink was top notch as well, the animosity and fragility she showed broke me at the end. I hope she gets to play a more different character in her future projects because while it was a great performance I couldn't help but look at her character as a shitty (personality wise, not performance wise) version of Max.\nNow, Brendan Fraser, thank you Darren for giving this man the space to remind people the acting chops Brendan possesses. The way Brendan was able to give Charlie's character so much light and darkness was amazing. The way Charlie used food as his vice and accelerator felt incredibly authentic. \nThe last 10 minutes of this movie had me in pieces, I couldn't ask for a better ending to such a greatly performed and written film.

Very human and uplighting besides one or two moments that are difficult to watch. The story deals with real life and overcoming  human failure..and love.  The backdrop of the movie is about the main character's obesity, but the story doesn't focus on this. The story shows a complex and contemporary reality that shouldn't be hidden, secret, negated or denied as if we were young Buddha living an isolated life pretending that death doesn't exist. Not all movies are about puppies, but a movie about a real and difficult life can still have a positive message without being preachy. You'll feel wonderful, hopeful after watching.   Good for the family to watch with kids that are not too young for it's content. I think everyone should watch this movie that feels like theater (it's based on a play on Broadway from 2012).",

But don't be fooled by the lack of scenery changes, because the performances are outstanding, especially Brendan Fraser's portrayal of Charlie. He brings a sincerity to the role that is both open and gentle, and will leave you rooting for him despite his flaws.\n\nDirector Darren Aronofsky's obsession with the grotesque is alive and well in this film, but he manages to skirt the edge of exploitation and instead presents us with a splayed-open tragedy that is weirdly romantic. The film's rawness and wall-to-wall woe will leave you devastated, but also moved and practicing sympathy and forgiveness. And while the film doesn't add up to much in the end, the performances are top-notch, especially when Fraser, Chau, and Sink verbally bounce off of each other.

            "content": "Once again, the audience score is a better indicator than the critic reviews. Just another case of critics trying to influence rather than review. Rotten Tomatoes critics can kick rocks.\n\nI appreciate the realism of this movie. Charlie's health looms heavy on the lives of even those who don't know him but should encounter the gravity of his existence (take or leave the pun). But through this very encumbered life, one might expect Charlie to be more humiliated, more panicked, more called-to-action... but like many of life's mortal traps, that is not often the case. Early in the movie, it becomes obvious that Charlie has in a way transcended these feelings (not a healthy way). He has literally become numb to the sense of failure, worthlessness, loneliness, and desperation.\n \nDon't get me wrong, Charlie understands these things. He thinks himself to be a failure... alone... desperate... worthless, etc... but he has found a way to turn all of this into just a general state of aloof shame. \"Sorry\" just rolls off his tongue, and he doesn't even have the energy to resent people's disgust or pity anymore. Almost like he is bored of the indignity he has become accustomed to.\n \nYou can see it, particularly with his daughter. He's willing to bribe her with his life's accumulated wealth and without condition. He's simply a dead person who hasn't died yet... to himself.\n \nAs a person who has dealt with mental health issues in my family as well as drug problems, it's so refreshing to see a director take this candid angle... where the elephant in the room is not made the spectacle it should be. People expect problems of addiction to be reckless, but more times than not, it's very patient. It's mundane. It's a slow-moving train wreck... and once you find yourself there, you've been there for quite a while.\n \nAny story of addiction is in and of itself an extremely potent and important cautionary tale, but to see Charlie's story expressed as a more tedious than emergent circumstance... that's a very important character point of view to truly understanding what is and has been going on in that room for the last decade.\n \nThis movie is built on that foundation... and that foundation is strong. I'll say it now, this movie will save lives. The humanity in this movie is palpable, relatable, and most importantly, actionable. While it is technically a work of fiction, it's simply more than that. It might not teach you your neighbor's circumstances, but it WILL teach you the shape of such circumstances.\n \nWatch this movie with your family, friends, and neighbors in mind... and maybe yourself too. We're all in this thing together. Be good to yourself and others.",

What was surprising were the negative reviews from movie critics (like the one from my favorite critic's posthumous confab RogerEbert.com.) I disagree with critics who gripe about the movie's stereotyping fat people. At least I didn't take the movie that way. \n\nI garner that the themes of the movie are a cookie cutter assemblage of grief, mourning, depression, pain, self loathing, and moments of brilliance and wit that are in any good film. It's just that the poison of choice was a fat person—no morbidly obese person. \n\nI will admit that I gawked at the cabinet of curiosity. I did feel disgust as he choked on a piece of food he wolfed down. But that's not because of pity or disdain for the character it's actually a swig of self loathing because I could be there. I think those critics might feel guilt for all those feelings And at some levels self pity because we've ALL been in Charlie's place. Maybe food is not your drug of choice  but certainly overindulgence in social media, wine, fillers, surgery, or fill in the blank with your vice. \n\nThe consequences of those vices are usually hidden—no one can look at you and tell you're addicted to social media or a budding alcoholic etc. With obesity, it's very much visual display of what can be the cause of an addiction to food. So it's funny or pitiful or cabinet-of-curiosity fun to look at. \n\nWhatever the consequent stereotypes to being obese is—they are real reactions people have to seeing a man not only eat himself to death but witnessing a downward spiral. Getting up and being soo big that you knock over stuff is sad and comically embarrassing. It's the reason why \"Yo mama so fat\" jokes exist. It's an insult to be called fat. That's real cultural phenomenon that happens in America. The portrayal of fat shaming—however cruel it may be in this film is a real thing that happens in society. Why should the film maker not capture that?\n\nI didn't give it all the stars Because I wish the director strayed away from the play format a little bit and gave an insight to outside of the apartment and the ending—though predicted—didn't feel like a contrasting crescendo this film needed.",

With this knowledge, Charlie decides to spend his last few days getting to know his estranged 17-year-old daughter. During this time, he's also visited by a young missionary from a local evangelical, end-times focused church who wants to lead him to salvation.\n\nLiz is accustomed to being Charlie's only visitor and does not want guests coming by while Charlie is in this fragile state. Over the few days, the missionary grows in his belief that God led him to Charlie, and Charlie doubles down on his desire to reconcile with his daughter, offering her money and asking her to share her thoughts and be honest with him so that he can know her.\n\nThere are no heroes in this movie. Liz is overbearing and sometimes enabling to Charlie. Charlie's daughter Ellie is mean and full of fury. Her own mom calls her \"evil\". His ex-wife is a bitter alcoholic. The missionary is a liar. Charlie abandoned his family and deals with his pain through self-harm and self-pity.\n\nBut that's kind of the point. All of these people are broken and imperfect. They are all human. Like it or not, they all need to be saved.\n\nBut as Liz points out, you can't save another person, not really.\n\nCharlie knows he can't save himself, but he's on a quest to find redemption before he dies, and it's all tied up in his daughter. He wants her to know she is special, that she can care about other people and be cared for - a message that's tough for her to hear from a dad who abandoned her and closed himself off from the world. He tries nonetheless, and there's something brave about that.\n\nThe movie grapples with faith in a way that provides a lot of theories and no answers, but feels incredibly sincere, something that's tough to do well onscreen.\n\nCharlie is a complex character, a very human character, and Brendan Fraser will likely win an Oscar for embodying these contradictions so well. Sadie Sink gives a performance wise beyond her years and Hong Chau (who seems to be in everything these days) gives us another performance of strong, quiet toughness.",

That said, I didn't actually like the film. \n\nThe Whale really doesn't actually say much, it's repetitively beating you over the head with notes on acceptance, forgiveness, and empathy but the story doesn't evolve nor does it convey anything particularly powerful, it's just told through a lot of strained breaths and sobbing that try to trick you into thinking that the writing is good. The script is awfully heavy-handed and that's a nightmare for a film that deals with not only family dynamics but religious belief, plus all the exposition makes it feel clunky. Subtlety is not a word that this filmmaker has ever heard in his life, and the 'revelations' that the protagonist undergoes as well as the ridiculously over-the-top behaviour of Sadie Sink's Ellie are a testament to that. The ending was silly and noncommittal, and it seems more like the writers just didn't know how to put the period to the script after a supposedly emotional final reconciliation.\n\nThe only real saving grace for this film is the performances, both from Fraser and Hong Chau. Everything else is poisoned by Aronofsky's painful use of allegory and lack of nuance. Brendan can collect his trophies and move on to all-around better projects. (2.5/5)",

            "content": "The Whale is an epic saga of grief and redemption that demands to be seen by the whole world immediately. This film is one of the most heart-melting and rewarding movies I have ever seen. There's dramatic character development, stimulative dialogue and phenomenal performances. The cast, especially Brendan Fraser, took the film's inspiring synopsis and made it better, if not emotional, on so many levels. Fraser returns to the screen with a big bang in a career-best performance; it's great to see him back. As much as I love this film, I did run into its imperfections. No film is perfect though, right? The only conflict I came across with The Whale was finding out how Ellie's character is extremely unlikable, it's mildly exhausting. Usually, I try to avoid giving attention to my least favorite characters, but Ellie really stood out to me. It seems that everything she does is toxic, manipulative and vastly disrespectful, to the point where it's life-threatening. Ellie has a devastating, yet very strong impact on other characters and blackmails them to be rebellious as her. For instance, Ellie dares a devoted young Christian, Thomas, to take a hit of her pot and says that she'll call 911 and tell the cops that he raped her if he did not comply. We find out shortly after that she was \"joking\". Extremely disgusting and unprofessional. Ellie also takes pictures of her father and cyberbullies him on Facebook, which turns out she does that to the vast majority of the characters in the film. Did I mention she drugs her father too? It seems that all the other characters mature, but she just stays where she is. I honestly don't understand why Charlie gives her the chance. Look, I love Sadie Sink as an actress, but seeing her, or any other actress follow the same script Ellie did, I would find them annoying. But despite my criticism, this unique movie shows rare compassion, and long-lasting friendships that are in the sequence of healing. I love how Darren Aronofsky managed to blend in Christianity too. The ending melted my heart and made my eyes water. The Whale is a must-watch and believe me, the hype about it is real. My personal rating: 9/10",

            "content": "The movie affected me exactly the way I thought it would; it made me sad and a little depressed. As far as the acting was concerned, Brendan Frasier delivered a stellar performance as a lonely man with a horrific eating disorder who seeks to redeem himself for a number of things--leaving his wife and daughter for a man, eating himself into morbid obesity, not being able to save his partner for an eating disorder that killed him, you name it. However, his main focus seems to be saving his daughter from being labeled a lost cause as a student and human being. While I can't blame the daughter Ella for having anger issues for being abandoned, it would have been nice if she had known the truth about her father distancing himself from her. I do have a problem with people using God as a crutch to explain away their misery, I also have problem with certain religions misusing the gospel to punish people and make them feel worse about their life choices than they already do. But that is a personal observation of how I'm interpreting the church that is central to the story. Charlie finding salvation in telling his daughter how wonderful she is, in the end helps him to find salvation and he ascends to heaven through believing in his daughter and telling so. Ultimately, the movie made me incredibly uncomfortable (the opening sequence of his masturbating to gay porn) and depressing because this man could have saved himself and chose not to. He literally gives up and dies I guess in an effort to save his daughter. I'm not sure if we're supposed to draw some religious parallel from this or not. It left me feeling helpless and hopeless.",

On the flipside, I wasn't happy with Aronofsky's choice to give us a film sized inside a square - 1970's tube TV's aspect ratio, when many of us paid a lot of money for wide-screen TV's. That was constantly annoying throughout the entire film.\n\nBut I did enjoy the fact this film had many layers to it, but I'm not sure that all those layers were executed properly. For example, the end result of how Thomas' family responded to Ellie's actions is a coin toss, and either result would've not defined Ellie's true intentions or her character. For that matter, Thomas' relevance in the film was also in question, and felt more like an unnecessary distraction instead of complimenting the narrative.\n\nThe same goes for Ellie's character and her true feelings about her dad, and questioning her true character; was she a hateful troubled teenager, or did she actually have a caring and loving side. The filmmakers didn't leave that too much in question, and had me convinced she actually was that terrible teenager, which ultimately detracts from the final scene.\n\nI've never seen the play, but as a film, just those few issues needed more exploration and cohesion with the films narrative, and I feel the filmmakers could've done a better job with Ellie and Thomas' characters. The rest of the characters, especially Liz, were portrayed properly, especially Fraser's character.\n\nNevertheless, it's a well done film, and an outstanding award winning-worthy performance by Fraser. I know the critics were a little hard on this film, but it's still worthy for a one-time viewing.",

Plus, I'm a big fan of Darren Aronofsky, and so I was happy to see him back too. The film's play roots are evident, from the dialogue and character driven story, to the limited locations, to the staging of most of the scenes and lack of flashy editing or effects. It's a pretty simple story about a father trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter, with the twist being that the father weighs several hundred pounds and is borderline immobile. Fraser brings a lot of humanity and believability to the role, and its smart that his weight isn't what defines him, he has an actual personality. With such a small cast of characters, its easier to make everyone feel 3 dimensional, and that's what the movie does, with the exception of the daughter character. The ways she's written and played is so over the top nasty and spiteful, and with virtually no redeeming features, that'll you'll grow tired of her very quickly. It's such a shame that this individual is so key to the central conflict, because we have to endure her rants, insults, abuse and constant belittlement to the point that Charlie's adoration of her, even by the standards of someone starved for company and compassion, makes no sense, and the film becomes a drag whenever she's onscreen. It's a hugely melodramatic film, with the 3rd act feeling like one long crying scene, but if you're wrapped up in Fraser performance and character you'll likely be shedding tears yourself when the credits roll. It's another well-crafted and highly divisive film from Aronofsky, a man who's made a living enthralling and shocking his audience, and while I can't see myself watching it again, the story and characters make one watch more than worth your time.",

            "content": "Brendan Fraser delivers a triumphant comeback performance in Darren Aronofsky's most recent feature \"The Whale\". Samuel D. Hunter adapts his own award-winning play for the big screen, telling a devastating story about one man's last shot at redemption. Aronofsky's decade-long quest to get the film made has finally come to fruition in the form of a haunting drama that takes place entirely in one apartment in Idaho during the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nCharlie (Brendan Fraser) is a reclusive college professor who teaches online writing classes from the comfort of his couch and behind the façade of a broken laptop camera. He has no friends, apart from his nurse Liz (Hong Chau), and the only visitors he gets are a pizza delivery guy and a Mormon missionary called Thomas (Ty Simpkins). Charlie's obesity is causing detrimental damage to his health and his steadfast refusal to go to the hospital doesn't help, but when Liz tells him he's at risk of heart failure, the grave reality of his situation dawns on Charlie. With only weeks, if not days left, he decides to attempt to reconnect with his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink).\n\n\"The Whale\" is fuelled by sensational turns from the entire cast, but Brendan Fraser's portrayal of Charlie stands out as one of the best performances of 2022. Fraser captures heart-breaking emotion in his performance, effortlessly bringing Charlie's vulnerability to the screen. The various prosthetic pieces Fraser donned to transform into Charlie elevated his performance to another level, balancing impactful emotion with an impressive physical performance also. The film allows Fraser to deliver the best performance of his career that will hopefully garner the actor his first Oscar nomination. \"Stranger Things\" star Sadie Sink appears alongside Fraser taking on the role of Ellie, Charlie's estranged teenage daughter. Sink delivers a powerful performance that immediately lets audiences know just how spiteful the 17-year-old highschooler can be, spitting venomous words taken straight from the pages of Hunter's play. Hong Chau adds to her already impressive year, appearing in Kelly Reichardt's \"Showing Up\" and Mark Mylod's \"The Menu\", delivering a stunning performance, shining in every scene she's in.\n\n\"The Whale\" is a stellar adaptation of Hunter's play, it flawlessly brings the characters and the story to the screen through a layered, thematic screenplay that forms the foundation for an impactful drama. The film balances a handful of emotions including guilt, shame, and anger, and themes like grief and religion. \"Insidious\" star Ty Simpkins, through a strong performance, embodies the film's themes of religion by portraying a Mormon missionary who tries to convert Charlie to Mormonism in order to ‘save him', but as the film progresses it's revealed that both Charlie and Liz already have a connection to the religion, bringing up painful memories and opening old wounds. The film also weaves in references to the Herman Melville's novel \"Moby Dick\" and other marine-themed components including the recurring sound of waves which was taken directly from Hunter's play.\n\nOscar-nominee and long-time Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique once again gets to show off his immense talent for creating stunning visuals. Libatique uses the fact that the film takes place entirely in one location (Charlie's apartment), except for one scene at the start, to craft stunning visuals that emphasises the isolation Charlie feels because he's unable to leave his apartment. This puts the audience in his shoes, allowing them to feel the same isolation he does, only seeing other people when they come to visit. Libatique's work compliments the other technical aspects of the film, from Andrew Weisblum's editing to the remarkaPble special effects makeup, courtesy of Adrien Morot (\"Barney's Version\"), that reinforces Fraser's performance. Composer Rob Simonsen (\"Foxcatcher\") produces a haunting score that excellently matches the film's empathy and aching sadness.\n\n\"The Whale\" is a film lead by an outstanding performance from Brendan Fraser and is bolstered by marvellous supporting turns from Sadie Sink, Hong Chau and Ty Simpkins. Darren Aronofsky directs a sensational adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's play, and fingers crossed he directs Fraser to a very well-deserved Oscar nomination. This is by far one of 2022's most powerful films, full to the brim with gut-wrenching emotion that will leave you teary eyed. \"The Whale\" sticks with you long after the credits have rolled, from the performances (especially Fraser's and Sink's) to the complex themes covered throughout the neat two-hour runtime.",

His only visitors are his nurse, his embittered daughter, a religious missionary boy hoping to convert him, his ex-wife, and his pizza delivery man who has come to know him by name. Fraser is buried under a fat suit simulating a 600-pound man. Many have praised Fraser's performance, and it is very good, but I don't think it is Oscar worthy. Working under heavy makeup is not an automatic Oscar nod IMHO.

Truly outstanding from the first scene (yes, even with that... ha) to the very last. It's great to see the dude that I first saw as a kid in 'George of the Jungle' well and truly back in the game.\n\nOne thing about Fraser getting all the (undoubtedly merited) plaudits from this Darren Aronofsky flick is that I didn't know what to expect from the support cast, and man are there some absolutely stellar performances behind Fraser. Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton are top notch, though Hong Chau is a cut above that trio - brilliant stuff from her!\n\nThere are some powerful scenes in there. I'm not one to cry with fictional works (my brain automatically knows it's 'fake', I can't help it) but man even I got major goosebumps and gut punches (pardon the pun?) from what's portrayed onscreen.

She warns him that he is at severe risk of congestive heart failure, but Charlie refuses her suggestion to go to the hospital. Then one day out of the blue, Charlie us visited by Ellie, his estranged daughter who is now a HS senior...\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest from director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For a Dream\", \"The Wrestler\"). Here he brings the theater play of the same name by Samuel Hunter to the big screen. The movie doesn't betray its theater roots and in fact the entire film plays out in Charlie's apartment. There are a lot of heavy duty discussions in this film, a sizeable portion on religion, of all things. The cast is outstanding, including Hong Chau (as Liz) and. Sadie Sink (as Ellie). But the film will be mostly remembered for the towering performance by Brandon Fraser as the obese Charlie. I read that it took 4 hours each day to get the prosthetics arranged. Of course none of this would've mattered if it weren't for the high quality script by Samuel Hunter (who also wrote the stage play). In all, I didn't know how I would react to this film, obvious Oscar-baiting material. Turns out this is solid film starring a staggering performance by Fraser. He rightly got a Best Actor Oscar nod and he is probably a strong favorite to win it. Hollywood just loves a good comeback story like this one,\n\n\"The Whale\" premiered at Venice film festival in September yo immediate critical acclaim. It opened in US theaters some 2-3 weeks ago. The day-after-Christmas early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (I counted about 15-20 people). If you are in the mood for a heavy duty drama starring a towering Brendan Fraser, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",

I may be biased as a lot of themes really hit home (not even just the deep dive on coping mechanisms, trauma, addiction, religion, discrimination etc. the movie explores, but family themes). I was left shattered, waiting in my seat wiping uncontrollable tears long after the movie finished. There were small portions of humour (particularly dark) sprinkled throughout, and genuinely beautiful moments shrouded in the overarching plot. At the same time, it was quite uplifting, beautiful and thoughtful. I definitely recommend this film, however think in a critical or objective sense (or that of someone not so sympathetic or empathic) it's nothing too ground-breaking.

Whether you're an obese man attracted to your own sex or a woman consumed by addictions (and the \"parents\" here share this devastating illness), you will come out from the theater a better human being. Only sociopaths with almost no empathy would miss the beautiful story behind this glorious portrayal of the struggle for authenticity, the redeeming power of teenage angst, and the freedom coming from making an effort and stepping under the light of love.\n\nI'm an obese man, and I was held in my emotions by this movie. It exactly portrays how I feel, think, and suffer. If you get anything out of this movie, I hope it's a lesson in not being judgmental of others and a better understanding of how much we suffer.",

I was engrossed at times but somehow this film didn't fully connect with me. Based on a play the action all takes place in the house of Charlie, an English professor who teaches all of his classes online. He is also extremely obese, to the point where his health is failing badly and he is near death because of this. He is cared for by Liz, his nurse and only friend. She wants him to go to a hospital but he refuses. Two other people enter this world in the film. Ellie, his long estranged daughter from a failed marriage. And Thomas, a New Life missionary who tries to convert him. As the film progresses we learn the tragic circumstances behind Charlie's current state. This is a very confined film and I think that sometimes works against it. And even though the acting is generally fine I thought the characters tended to be a bit one onte and not fully realised. Brendan Fraser is great though as Charlie, it's a hard role and I think he pulls it off mostly. And Hong Chau is great as Liz, probably the most fleshed out character in the film. This is a very worthy film and one that has a strong emotional core. But I feel it could have been executed a little better.",

Trauma exists and it's not always dealt with properly. Or in such a detrimental way. But these things happen to us all in one way or another and it's important that it's seen. This film is incredible for tackling so much pure pain and love at once. It's humanity in its most natural form. Every emotion displayed by each character is real and just and it makes the viewer question what it really means to be human. I had to keep reminding myself Brendan was acting and Charlie wasn't a real person.

            "content": "There is something that doesn't quite hit the mark in THE WHALE, but it is still a worthwhile movie to watch. Charlie, a reclusive English teacher suffering from severe obesity, attempts to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter in a desperate bid for redemption. With his time running out and his health failing, Charlie must fight his way through his self-imposed isolation and the walls he's built up around him to find the courage to open up to his daughter and to find a way to make amends.\n\nBrendan Fraser, who plays Charlie, does an incredible job of conveying the complex emotions and struggles of being overweight. His performance is convincing and heartbreaking as he battles his physical limitations while attempting to build a bridge between himself and his daughter. Fraser's portrayal of Charlie is believable, allowing us to empathise with him despite his flaws.\n\nTHE WHALE also features impressive performances from young actor Sadie Sink (Charlie's daughter, Ellie) and Hong Chau (Liz, Charlie's best and only friend). Sink does an excellent job of portraying the tension between Ellie and her father, as well as conveying the emotions of an adolescent trying to cope with an absent parent. Chau is also excellent in her role, providing much-needed comedic relief while still being able to convey genuine emotion and concern for Charlie.\n\nTHE WHALE occurs almost entirely in Charlie's apartment. This setting allows the film to focus on the personal drama between Charlie and Ellie and provides a claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the sense of desperation and isolation. Director Darren Aronofsky uses this limited space to significant effect, creating an intimate portrait of two people struggling with their issues while trying to bridge the gap between them.\n\nThe cinematography in THE WHALE is also noteworthy. The camera often lingers on Fraser's face or body for extended periods, allowing us to fully appreciate the physical and emotional toll that Charlie's condition has taken on him.\n\nUnfortunately, THE WHALE suffers a few shortcomings that prevent it from being genuinely great. The pacing is sometimes slow, with some scenes dragging on longer than necessary. The film also lacks much plot development or character growth, leaving some characters feeling one-dimensional and underdeveloped. It also seems, at times, to have the feel of a stage production rather than a fully-fledged cinematic experience.\n\nDespite these issues, THE WHALE is an emotionally resonant film worth watching for its performances alone. It may not be perfect, but it is a thought-provoking and poignant film that will leave you with much to ponder.",

Charlie is obese, an ailment that has manifested itself as a coping mechanism for a life of regret. In every scene and interaction this regret is worn by Charlie as a cloak of his past that will stay with him until his dying breath. This character is an immense undertaking and Brendon Fraser plays him perfectly. The emotion he delivers is palpable, which lends itself so seamlessly to scenes of raw sadness and despair. Not only is Fraser a highlight, but the entire supporting cast does an excellent job. Hong Chau is superb, and despite her tough, no nonsense, science focused exterior hides a deep and genuine connection with Charlie. She is incredibly hurt by the way he is treating his body, but is defenseless to his desires, resulting in her to continually feed his addiction. It is a brutal back and forth that is tackled with immense care. Sadie Sink is great as well, she is delivers a brutal performance that leaves the character of Ellie easily hatable with very little redeemable qualities. I understand that this was the point of her character, and by no means is this a knock on Sink's performance, but it felt like a bit much. She was too cruel, to the point of unbelievability, which took a bit away from the message that was trying to be delivered. The pace was a bit slow for my liking. I felt as if the Thomas subplot was a bit pointless and could have been cut from the movie with no ill effects. But despite my minor complaints, the movie is carried by fantastic performances, amazing cinematography and intense emotions that will leave many viewers pleased with their experience, but will not be for everyone.\n\nScore: 82%\nVerdict: Great",

I wonder if the case of being extremely overweight were presented in the opposite direction where the main character is starving to death, would those who found this aspect of the movie disgusting be more sympathetic to the main character. Our culture in the US is obsessed with being skinny and admonishes those for being overweight. \n\nIn this movie it clearly shows that depression is the result of regretting the past and anxiety is the result of worrying about the future.  When you have both it presents itself to victims as a prison where there is no escape and making life a living hell.",

The poignant scenes where Charly speaks so calmly, eloquently and intelligently to his group of students, yet while all the students faces are shown on the internet zoom screen, a blank space (for the teacher) is all that the students see is so profound. They are completely unaware of the desperately sad, emotional,  lonely & grossly overweight figure behind the screen. until the last moments of the movie. \n\nThere are scenes in this movie that will leave you emotionally wrecked as you can't help but be deeply moved by many of the heart-wrenching scenes as he valiantly tries to reconnect with the teenage  daughter he abandoned when she was just 8 yrs old. His daughter, Ellie, (played by Sadie Sink), is however full of hate and disgust for her father and she treats with with absolute distain.\n\nAnd that stare … OMG, Charly reaches into the belly of the big screen with the saddest, loneliest, grief stricken and heartbroken expressive eyes that seriously will have you reaching for the tissues. You see the desperately torn man who through grief, love and loss of his male partner years before led him to spiral out of control and end up the in the grossly disturbing physical & mental state that the viewers see as he literally eats himself to death.  It is real, raw, heartbreaking and emotional as you see lives and relationships ruined as a result of Charly's despair.   It is something that I feel could so easily resonate with any other \"regular\" family. \n\nThe binge eating scenes I tell you will shock and sadden you to your core and just wanna make you throw your arms around this mountain of a man as he devours everything in sight while googling congestive heart failure.\n\nBrendan Fraser delivers a portrayal of a broken man full of regret, a prisoner in his own body who can't leave his apartment.  He shocks us and saddens us with his grossness, yet is also disarmingly graceful and full of sensitivity. \n\nThis is a movie so disturbingly honest &  it will piece your spirit in very unexpected ways. It's not an easy watch, but a necessary one & I guarantee it will leave you changed. \n\nThe whole movie is shot from his apartment, much like a stage play yet this in no way detracts. It is portrayed over a one week timetable in which Charly gets visits from other cast members including Thomas, a missionary who wants to save Charly's soul, his long-suffering carer (Liz) played by Hong Chau, his daughter Ellie & her embittered mother, Mary. \n\nA powerful, and very moving film that you MUST go & see.   I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

All the noise that surrounds us today with body image issues and obesity causes us to have a very black and white and narrow understanding and acceptance of these issues. We are so afraid to question this movement, this huge shift in our society so seeing a different point of view, a much more raw and ordinary existence on screen been questioned and challenged in my eyes is truly courageous and beautiful.\n\nThe movie leaves you with self-reflection and encourages understanding and empathy not judgement or dismissal.",

Good special effects though many scene graphics were not needed and over played. Sign that this director is still young and hopefully (for the sake of his/her career) gets better.

            "content": "In \"The Whale,\" actor Brendan Fraser (\"Crash,\" \"The Mummy\" series) is transformed by prosthetics into a character so morbidly obese that simply rising from a chair represents superhuman effort.  Director Darren Aronofsky (\"The Wrestler,\" \"Black Swan\") confronts us with this spectacle, then dares us to look away.  Aronofsky also injects a few familiar elements into the proceedings – an anguished protagonist, surrealism and a general sense of melodrama.\nIn this chamber piece, Charlie (Fraser) has congestive heart failure.  He's literally eating himself to death.  In Idaho.  He's unable to leave his claustrophobic, poorly-lit apartment.  He spends his time teaching online classes in creative writing and receiving caretaker visits from Liz (a fantastic Hong Chau – \"The Watchmen TV series).  Realizing that he is in his last days, Charlie makes a final effort to reconnect with his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink – TV's \"Stranger Things\").  As they story unfolds, the moviegoer learns that Charlie abandoned Ellie when she was eight because he fell in love with a male student.  Unsurprisingly, Ellie has some anger and abandonment issues.\nOne of the fascinating elements of this film is Charlie's steadfast optimism.  When Ellie's mother describes her as evil, Charlie rises, metaphorically, to her defense.  It's an intended irony that Charlie is able to offer powerful grace and absolution (there are a fair number of theological themes here) to nearly everyone but himself.\nThroughout, \"The Whale\" feels much more like a play than a movie.  It was originally a stage production, with playwright Samuel D. Hunter acting here as the screenwriter.  Some of the \"action,\" dialogue and staging are never translated effectively to this different medium.  It becomes a distraction when the actors sometimes seem restricted to broad movements and loud voices, mannerisms that don't work well with Aronofsky's camera inches from their faces.\nIt's hard to know how to react honestly to Fraser's performance.  It's a long Hollywood tradition to respect, even revere, actors who go through dramatic physical transformations.  Think Christian Bale in \"The Fighter,\" Charlize Theron in \"Monster,\" Joaquin Phoenix in \"The Joker,\" or most recently Glenn Close in \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Here, Fraser does a wonderful job of showing the humanity and humor of a character who could easily be singularly unappealing.  But I'm not sure it's worth the Oscar buzz generated by many professional critics.\nUltimately, \"The Whale\" is a study in inconsistency.  Its paradoxes can be summed up by one of the key scenes where Charlie earnestly applauds and encourages the members of his online class who have made the effort to reveal themselves by expressing their own hard-earned truths.  It's ironic that this exhortation comes from a character whose enormous bulk is clearly used to keep everyone away.",

The whole movie seemed like the plot of the movie, was to make the main character be seen as a victim. The main character was constantly victimizing himself and burrowing in his self hatred and sorrows; when he could've formed a relationship with his daughter. I thought I would leave crying from the movie but I left in shock that it had so many good reviews. I would however like to add that Brendan Fraser did great acting. However, I think the director and writer lost the meaning and direction they had for the movie.",

Hunter whose play he has himself adapted for Darren Aronofsky's new film. Charlie is a morbidly obese, sweaty and balding online English tutor who's so grief-stricken and ashamed, he never leaves his house and over the course of 5 days, the film charts the visits made by Hong Chau's nurse friend, Liz, Ty Simpkins' eager missionary, Thomas and Sadie Sink's angry daughter, Ellie, whom Charlie has abandoned years ago and is now trying to reconnect with. Manifesting his disgust for himself physically through his overeating and obesity, it requires an equally fearless actor to take on the role and a particularly ego-free Brendan Fraser, making his cinematic comeback after perfecting a similar role on Doom Patrol, literally disappears into the heavy and grotesque prosthetic suit to become Charlie in an affecting and incredibly nuanced and complex turn that makes him the man to beat comes this year's Oscars. Whilst this film is admittedly stagy and perhaps sentimental even, these criticisms pale into insignificance in the face of such a strong, moving and emotionally powerful screenplay that uses Melville's Moby Dick as a springboard to illustrate the state of mind of its main characters, not to mention also allusions to Charlie's physical size. Initially sketchy characters develop surprising depth and layers as they are gradually fleshed out and their backstories revealed, while Charlie searches for redemption with the erratic Ellie. This is that rare beast of a film where an intricately constructed screenplay meets a tremendous cast that delivers with aplomb, producing something that grabbed me immediately from the beginning and never let up until it arrives at its gloriously humane and empathetic conclusion.",

Sadie Sink, the girl who plays the daughter, nearly steals the show at times with a really strong performance but then disappears from the plot for a little while.\n\nOverall I would put this in the solidly good and maybe even very good category but not great.

I loved it.\n\nSomething better happened for me. As a race, human beings are all about looks. If you see an obese person, that may be all you see, but that's not who we are supposed to be to one another. \n\nThis movie went to the heart of Fraser's character, and let the audience see the struggle of obesity and the addiction to food. \n\nPerhaps some people will walk away with more than they bargained for, perhaps they will see people beyond flesh and bone, for what their soul is trying to say. Perhaps the jokes that we say out loud for a quick laugh will someday end.\n\nFinally, when this movie ended, when the screen turned white and the credits rolled, no one, including myself, got up from their seats.

Reading the negative reviews, critics seems to dwell most on Brendan Fraser's prosthetics, as if Aronofsky just wanted to turn him into a freakshow so we could marvel at his grotesquerie. Some critics say the film's premise is \"inherently dehumanizing.\" I didn't get that at all. Fraser's performance was amazing and all-too-human. But Aronofsky has always been polarizing, so there's that. Anyway .... 9 out of 10 stars for me.",

Pace is slow, but it's a drama, it's meant to be fleshed out. It doesn't wow or thrill or inspire awe, but it does hit you square in the heart. Brendan gave his all to that role and you can see it from the very beginning. I couldn't help but want an after credit scene, something to let the audience know what happens with the characters next. The final hour of the film, give or take, is the most moving as the history behind each character is revealed. It's a touching story that makes you long for reconciliation. The sad truth of the film is this: dying is no fairytale. We want to think there's going to be a chance to make everything right before the end, that this mortal coil can somehow be made whole through forgiveness. It's a poor substitute. When all is said and done, no one goes with you when your time comes, and you likely won't know when that will be. There's no more goodbyes after that, no more second chances. All that's left is what you've left behind, and something that The Whale teaches us - which it teaches us several things - is that you shouldn't hide, shouldn't wait for those moments you've been wishing for or missing. Because a day will come that will be your last and all that's left will be the love you left behind. If you can, give all of the love you have. That's what people will want the most.",

Written by Samuel D. Hunter. Directed by Darren Aronofsky.  Staring Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Ty Simpkins, Samantha Morton, Sathya Sridharan, and Jacey Sink. \n\nThis powerful movie wrote on the slate of my soul.\n\nIt is possible that I felt its power so completely because of the circumstances and experiences I lived through this past year.\n\nBut if you imagine you will see it one day, see it now in the theaters.

Many films depict addiction and invoke drugs and alcohol, there is food addiction here which is a very real issue, as is the many other addictions beyond drug abuse. And really the film is about the central relationship, which is told well.\n\nFraser is unbelievably talented and commits to this character so fervently. Hong Chau and Sadie Sink stand out as supporting characters as well, with commanding presence and chemistry.\n\nIf you ask what this film is about it would be hard to pin down one theme: addiction, death, grieving, relationships, generational trauma, even inspiration and hope.",

Brendan Frasier, Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Ty Simpkins, and Samantha Morton give fantastic performances. I've never cried this much from a movie before. This movie really hit home for me due to recent events in my life. This movie definitely has its flaws but it's incredible. \n\nNow with the flaws, there aren't many but there are a couple. The most prominent one is the fact that there are so many subplots in a movie that is based in one single location. It makes the plot a little bit overwhelming at times but it's not terrible. Overall, this movie is fantastic and is one of the most emotional movies I've ever seen.",

            "content": "I truly and genuinely don't even know where to start when discussing The Whale. This movie broke me in so many ways, and I knew it would going in. I thought I could handle it but I was a wreck by the end. I think a lot of people will be turned away from this movie because it's hard to watch, and I would agree. This is the hardest movie I've had to sit though but I loved every bit of it. But I honestly don't know if I could ever watch it again, at the very least not alone. I've never walked into a movie with my food and chose not to eat it because the movie made me feel self conscious but this definitely did. It pains me to admit how much I relate to Charlie and Brendan Fraser plays him with so much charisma and kindness. He truly deserves every last little millisecond of the standing ovation he got when this premiered. Sadie Sink however plays her character in the total opposite direction and does such a good job at making you dislike her and like Charlie even more. Hong Chau really killed it this year with two standout performances but I really really liked her here. Ty Simpkins probably gives one of the best performances of his career so far, his character ended up having a lot of depth and emotion to him. Samantha Morton has a great couple minutes very deep into the movie and delivers a great performance alongside Fraser. Sathya Sridharan has a good recurring bit that ends up adding a lot to the story and themes. Daren Aronofsky crafts a fantastic story on grief, eating disorders, speaking the truth and being true to yourself, and the dangers of religious indoctrination. He manages to make a movie stuck in this one apartment very interesting and engaging. I got out of the theater and just sat in my car with this one for a minute. Probably not the best New Years watch because now I'll be sad all night. I really liked this one but I can't recommend it to everyone because I don't think everyone will be able to sit through it, it's really not easy. But for those who do I imagine they'll enjoy it. I for one absolutely loved it and I can't give it anything but a 10/10. What do you all think? Was it just as hard for you to sit though it? -Tyler.",

            "content": "Ever since I saw \"A Bright New Boise\" on stage in the basement theatre on Ludlow Avenue, I've been a fan of Samuel D. Hunter's work. As a playwright - and now as a screenwriter - he knows how to keep the action moving; he writes snappy and realistic dialogue. His characters are always well-rounded and exciting; they always have something to do and say that is meaningful and advances the story. And most of all, he is a master of telling a straightforward tale while using symbolism, metaphor, and insight to move the audience.\n\n\"The Whale\" is another of Hunter's plays, and I've long been anticipating its release on film. I've been reading and hearing about how great Brendan Fraser is as \"Charlie,\" the 600-pound protagonist, and I finally saw it this afternoon. This script - like \"Boise\" - examines faith, spirituality, and religion respectfully but honestly. Still, it allows for so much character work that the entire cast shines brightly.\n\nFraser is the star of the movie, of course, and is as natural as one could be in that much makeup and prosthetics. But equally convincing is Hong Chau as \"Liz,\" Charlie's only friend, Sadie Sink (\"Ellie,\" Charlie's estranged teenage daughter), Ty Simpkins (\"Thomas,\" a young man on a Christian mission), and Samantha Morton (\"Mary,\" Charlie's ex-wife.)\n\nAll of these characters' stories are peeled back like onions throughout the film, guided by the very patient hand of Darren Aronofsky. Aronofsky (\"Black Swan,\" \"The Wrestler\") always guides the audience through a story without rushing while making sure the characters - and thus the actors - stay in the forefront. In this 117-minute piece, he explores the fascinating dynamics between best friends, ex-lovers, parents and children, not to mention humanity's relationship with God. It's really well done.\n\nThe friend who accompanied me did not particularly like the movie. And if one was to approach this from a straightforward movie-going experience, I could understand the disappointment. The characters are all flawed; however, none of them are unredeemable. And that's the beauty of Charlie - despite his miserable, lonely, and painful existence, he never loses sight of the light in the world and in others.\n\nWho would have thought such a broken, depressing character could be a role model for us all? I think that's the beauty of \"The Whale.\"",

Everyone else was going to see Avatar, and I knew the subject of The Whale wouldn't appeal to everyone. \n\nBut for some reason, I knew I had to see that movie. \n\nI wasn't ready for this. The movie is very heavy, but Brandon Fraser performance is worth an Oscar. Litterally. It is one of the best acting I ever see. And I watch movies. A lot. \n\nI don't push back the acting of the entire crew. They are all amazing in their role, and we can see how much they were invested in this movie. \n\nBut Brandon deliver on an entire new level. He give 1000%, his all-in, in this role that is certainly (but I hope not) the apotheosis of his career. \n\nIt's a dark movie. Really really dark. It is not violent. The only violence his the main character attitude about himself. But the subject, and the realism with wich it is depicted, the dialogues, and the sadness that is present trought the story, this is what is dark. \n\nIt is not a cute story. It is not a nice story. But it is a beautiful essai, a love letter, to the beauty of the human soul trought the worst of the moments. \n\nThe way the motion picture is filmed around the house, in a huit-clos, is a fantastic way to constrain us to the world wich the main character live. His only world. And these toughts, this way of including so many details about the main character in that limited of a space, where the narrative is given by both the character and the environnement, make the story much more.\n\nI must admit I am kind of sensible, so I cried for a good amount of the last third of the movie. I smiled as some of the other people using portative kleenex bag in the room. \n\nI needed that. And I think only for this, it is a must see. But there is also a lot of other reasons why it is worth a watch. \n\n5 star on freaking 5 baby",

The many characters in this film felt real and visceral.  A tragedy painted in a flourish of hope.  I recognized many of the theater goers I watched this movie were young, skinny, and judgemental.  Snickering at me, as if I was the character Brendan Fraser played and with no empathy for this story.  I feel that regardless of how the film made me feel, I hope it impacts others to find their happiness, their honesty, and their resilience.   A great cry 😢",

            "content": "I'm not going to dive into the synopsis of the film because it is widely available online, and frankly, the film \"shows\" you the story so well that the brief synopsis wouldn't do the story any justice. I want to applaud every single actor who played roles in this movie. Though I'm sure some acting professors may find criticisms in each of their ability, I believe that they all poured their hearts out playing these characters, the characters who are all fully justified of their own positions. With the origin of the film being a stage play, the film does everything in its power to keep the story intact without feeling the need to show everything, which is difficult to come by in our modern society where everything is shown, rather than told.\n\nThe characters are symbolic to say the least. Even though Charlie (Brendan Fraser) and his obesity may seem like a fiction or a non-fiction, it ultimately does not matter. After all, obesity is simply one of the health outcomes that we witness in our lives. One could easily replace Charlie's obesity with something else and they would end up with the same results as far as the story goes. And Charlie's not the only character who carries this symbol. Not only is every character in this story symbolic, each one is absolutely justified AND self-righteous. It's an endless loop that the characters have entrapped themselves in and there is no room for escape. With the unconventional display ratio of the film (not the usual 16:9 ratio), it feels like watching a personal diary that's filled with self-deprecation, frustration, and sheer agony that is inside a tight box. It is a tough pill to swallow as an audience, but a necessary one as it tells the tale that everyone needs to listen and comprehend. The film is not preachy to motivate the audience members to be proactive, but rather simply feeds us different combinations of characters's stories and make us think. That is why I think it is completely pointless to finger at any flaws or imperfections as it only illustrates the humanity behind our perfect selfies and posts. \n\nAfter two hours of the film (and ugly-crying for an hour and 30 minutes of it), I started to think how I would describe this film through an analogy. Aesop's fable of the North Wind and the Sun encapsulates the totality of experience from watching The Whale: at the end of the day, it wasn't the powerful North Wind who led the individual to take off their cloak, but rather it was the calmly, yet intensely present Sun's ray. Instead of the fast dynamic of a storm, this film consistently kept on twisting our guts. It continued to linger with both of us long after the film was over, and dare I say that it will remain with us for a long time. Films like this are neither easy to watch, nor easy to come by. The ugliness of humanity shows up in many forms and shapes that we cannot ignore or escape from them. Maybe if we let go of our self-righteousness, and maybe if we stopped giving into the hubris that the characters in this film commit to, maybe, just maybe the potential of humanity might expand and shake the world a bit more. Salute to all the actors, the director, the writer, the creative professionals for bringing this film into our world!",

            "content": "THE WHALE – directed by Darren Aronofsky, written by Samuel D. Hunter (after his original play) with Brendan Fraser (Charlie), Sadie Sink (Ellie), Ty Simpkins (Thomas), Hong Chau (Liz)\n\nThere are several themes in THE WHALE: obesity, identity, same-gender relationships, abandonment, parenthood and writing – the honesty of writing. And all these interlocking subjects are contained in little more than one living room, where one orderly corner meets a chaotic one.\n\nI have read from those who feel offended by Daren Aronofsky's depiction of 600 lbs. Charlie, who  needs a walker to be able to move, who perspires with profusion, who, far from enjoying food, is an addict of it, and whose swallowing of pizzas and potato chips and jam and anything he finds in the fridge, is an emotional response to pain. His partner, unable to survive the judgment and rejection of his father, a pastor,  keeps losing weight and ends up committing suicide. This is the start of Charlie's bulging, and I wonder if the beginning of this disease is not his desire to bring back his lover, to feed him through his own distorted body. But I find no cruelty from director Darren Aronofsky in his portrayal. Neither cruelty nor disrespect. \n\nDoes that mean there is no cruelty in the film? Actually, cruelty is aplenty, and emanates from the judgement of others (not the director) and from Charlie himself, who left wife and child in favor of his male lover. And let's not read this as a condemnation of homosexuality; let's read this as a condemnation of abandonment.\n\nOne cruel character is Ellie, Charlie's teenage daughter, played brilliantly by Sadie Sink who, with the multiplicity  of contradicting emotions traveling through her glance in seconds, is the one who deserves an Oscar in this powerful cast. (While Brendar's Charlie is masterful, something must be said about the make-up artists who created obesity with such realism.)  It is within those glances that you see that Ellie's meanness is pain that she cannot always disguise when compassion and the need to get close to her father filter through. \n\nBut the cruelest of all is Thomas who claims his need to help with the message of God, but who ends up being a weak hypocrite who stole money from the church, who condemns Charlie's way of life, his love for another man, his \"disgusting\" appearance, and is all too happy to return to his parents and his selfishness. Writer Samuel Hunter's choice of Thomas is both ironic and symbolic, for it represents everyman's conflict between his need to believe and the proof that God exists. The Thomas of the film sees God as a faraway king, not as a force living in every being, and particularly by Charlie who sees the positive in everything and his conflicted daughter as \"amazing.\"\n\nRight away, Hunter tells us that we must look beyond the realism of the film. There is that constant motif of Moby Dick, of the whale (persecuted or persecutor), and the reminder that within the abandoned body of Charlie there the beautiful mind of a teacher who likes to share, embodied here by the computer English glass he teaches, where the videos of all students come across the screen, and where his image is replaced by a dark space that he refuses to fill with his appearance. Only his voice comes out, a warm baritone, the spirit of what he is.\n\nThe choice of the unity of place, at times suffocating, at times a womb, is a gutsy one, as well as the few characters that manage to create an entire universe with humanity's essential topics and worries. At times, when the voices rise and become so dramatic, I tell myself, this is more appropriate for the stage. And when I read the credits, I do find out that THE WHALE is originally a play by Samuel Hunter that he adapted for the big screen. But I wish he had gone further for this is cinema, I wish he had toned down those exclamations that make the movie less a piece of art than it could be. Sometimes murmurs are more powerful than shouts; sometimes sonatas are more powerful than symphonies. So when I read critics mention the lack of subtlety, I agree. For this is a film that needs subtlety.\n\nIt's still a film to watch. For all its themes. For the importance of addressing the disease of obesity. For opening a little wider our minds and our compassion.\n\n2.1.23",

            "content": "\"People are amazing.\"\n\nThe Whale is a film based on the play of the same name. This was easily my most anticipated film this entire year. The return of Brendan Fraser and another Darren Aronofsky film meant I would be seated on day one. After months of anticipation, I can say that The Whale provided an emotionally draining experience with brilliant, Oscar-winning performances all around. Brendan Fraser is as good if not better than you'd expect, he is brilliant here and if he doesn't win that Oscar I think I'll be sick. Charlie is a complex character that with the wrong actor and or performance, could've gone in a completely different direction. I can see why this film sat in developmental hell for years, as they really needed to find the perfect actor for this to work. But luckily Fraser wins you over as Charlie and you root for him the whole way through. The effects done to bring his body and character to life are nothing short of incredible either, it never feels over the top or unreasonable. Sadie Sink as Ellie was also incredible, she is a character you despise due to her attitude, but her character is redeemed once you learn more about her sympathetic situation. That character runs such a big risk of ruining the film, but luckily Sadie Sinks's performance and a strong script keep her character in check. Throughout this film, we are restricted to Charlie's apartment. Only ever seeing the outside in flashbacks or when Charlie enters his porch. His daily routines are the same each day and we watch Charlie follow these activities throughout the week. This makes the film feel shockingly real and very claustrophobic, which is exactly what Aronofsky wanted here. Hong Chau as Charlie's friend and nurse, Liz had a tough task presented towards her. She has to love and hate Charlie all the same, as she is his friend but wants to push him to get better when he stays stubborn about his life choices. I would not be surprised if she grabbed a nomination for best supporting actress. Where this film falls short is Ty Simpkins character, Thomas. He's a missionary who wants to help Charlie, his entire arc felt really out of place and most if not all scenes that focus purely on him felt dragged out and uninteresting. While I understand and actually liked the themes presented with his character being introduced here, it felt like his character was unnecessary majority of the time. The Whale falls flat in other areas too, such as some pacing issues, and the fact that at times it almost feels too much like a play, especially early on. While that may sound like the most extreme nitpick it made the film's structure feel extremely off at points. I don't mind if films feel like stage plays but only if it doesn't misconstrue their structure. Even with that said, by the end of this film, it really ties together nicely and provides one of the best endings to any film this entire year. Flaws and all, The Whale is another fantastic Aronofsky film that has me constantly thinking about it hours later. Bring your tissues, because The Whale is profoundly sad, yet inspiring. Go get that Oscar Brendan.",

            "content": "Brendan Fraser delivers a triumphant comeback performance in Darren Aronofsky's most recent feature \"The Whale\". Samuel D. Hunter adapts his own award-winning play for the big screen, telling a devastating story about one man's last shot at redemption. Aronofsky's decade-long quest to get the film made has finally come to fruition in the form of a haunting drama that takes place entirely in one apartment in Idaho during the 2016 U.S. election. \n\nCharlie (Brendan Fraser) is a reclusive college professor who teaches online writing classes from the comfort of his couch and behind the façade of a broken laptop camera. He has no friends, apart from his nurse Liz (Hong Chau), and the only visitors he gets are a pizza delivery guy and a Mormon missionary called Thomas (Ty Simpkins). Charlie's obesity is causing detrimental damage to his health and his steadfast refusal to go to the hospital doesn't help, but when Liz tells him he's at risk of heart failure, the grave reality of his situation dawns on Charlie. With only weeks, if not days left, he decides to attempt to reconnect with his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink). \n\n\"The Whale\" is fuelled by sensational turns from the entire cast, but Brendan Fraser's portrayal of Charlie stands out as one of the best performances of 2022. Fraser captures heart-breaking emotion in his performance, effortlessly bringing Charlie's vulnerability to the screen. The various prosthetic pieces Fraser donned to transform into Charlie elevated his performance to another level, balancing impactful emotion with an impressive physical performance also. The film allows Fraser to deliver the best performance of his career that will hopefully garner the actor his first Oscar nomination. \"Stranger Things\" star Sadie Sink appears alongside Fraser taking on the role of Ellie, Charlie's estranged teenage daughter. Sink delivers a powerful performance that immediately lets audiences know just how spiteful the 17-year-old highschooler can be, spitting venomous words taken straight from the pages of Hunter's play. Hong Chau adds to her already impressive year, appearing in Kelly Reichardt's \"Showing Up\" and Mark Mylod's \"The Menu\", delivering a stunning performance, shining in every scene she's in.\n\n\"The Whale\" is a stellar adaptation of Hunter's play, it flawlessly brings the characters and the story to the screen through a layered, thematic screenplay that forms the foundation for an impactful drama. The film balances a handful of emotions including guilt, shame, and anger, and themes like grief and religion. \"Insidious\" star Ty Simpkins, through a strong performance, embodies the film's themes of religion by portraying a Mormon missionary who tries to convert Charlie to Mormonism in order to ‘save him', but as the film progresses it's revealed that both Charlie and Liz already have a connection to the religion, bringing up painful memories and opening old wounds. The film also weaves in references to the Herman Melville's novel \"Moby Dick\" and other marine-themed components including the recurring sound of waves which was taken directly from Hunter's play. \n\nOscar-nominee and long-time Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique once again gets to show off his immense talent for creating stunning visuals. Libatique uses the fact that the film takes place entirely in one location (Charlie's apartment), except for one scene at the start, to craft stunning visuals that emphasises the isolation Charlie feels because he's unable to leave his apartment. This puts the audience in his shoes, allowing them to feel the same isolation he does, only seeing other people when they come to visit. Libatique's work compliments the other technical aspects of the film, from Andrew Weisblum's editing to the remarkaPble special effects makeup, courtesy of Adrien Morot (\"Barney's Version\"), that reinforces Fraser's performance. Composer Rob Simonsen (\"Foxcatcher\") produces a haunting score that excellently matches the film's empathy and aching sadness. \n\n\"The Whale\" is a film lead by an outstanding performance from Brendan Fraser and is bolstered by marvellous supporting turns from Sadie Sink, Hong Chau and Ty Simpkins. Darren Aronofsky directs a sensational adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's play, and fingers crossed he directs Fraser to a very well-deserved Oscar nomination. This is by far one of 2022's most powerful films, full to the brim with gut-wrenching emotion that will leave you teary eyed. \"The Whale\" sticks with you long after the credits have rolled, from the performances (especially Fraser's and Sink's) to the complex themes covered throughout the neat two-hour runtime.",

It's a raw, heart-wrenching tale of familial drama, trauma, and grief. Every scene peels back a new layer from the incredibly cast of characters. There is no scene that is not dedicated to character development, and every scene propels the narrative to higher stakes and character depth. Full of subtle and admittedly not-so-subtle symbolism, many of our 21st century anxieties are depicted. Thought-provoking and moving, what may at first seem like gratuitous shock, or over-the-top characterization, is actually perfectly paced and only introduced when needed to both familiarize the audience with brutal reality and to bring us further into despair with our characters. The classic Aronofsky character study, critics will dislike this one for being bold enough to hold a mirror to society, even if it means portraying controversial subject matter. Audiences can dislike it if they take it on face value without wanting to take a deep dive into characterization, be it the ones on-screen or their own. There is much at work here and it may take a second watch for some to understand all the characters.\n\nIn regards to the accusations of \"fatphobia\", I would argue that the main character's weight is treated as secondary to the primary story of grief and despair, as a symptom and not the problem. The film has a few shocking moments, with most happening at the start of the film, only to get the audience accustomed with the physical state of the main character. I would also argue that if people accuse something of being fatphobic simply because they are disgusted by seeing fat people, then they themselves are the problematic ones.",

He sees so much optimism in others, but so much disgust in himself.

There are definitely some that order all the time, but you don't get to know know much about them at all. But all you do know is that for how often they order, they cannot be that healthy.

A tour de force in embodying pain and joy through the simple gesture of eye contact through moments of both dialogue and solo shots. A story encapsulated in empathy and surrounded in sorrow, Aronofsky is able to recreate the intimacy of stage play through the blocking and committing to focus of the character Charlie and the week we spend with him, his family, and his environment. I do believe I had some hangups with the way the daughter character Ellie played by Sadie Sink, was handled towards the end of the movie. Without spoiling, I don't think the emotional pendulum is off based giving the story and the character, I did feel the grim reality was almost whisked away, in lue of conveying a bit more explicitly the underlying themes that parallel not only Moby Dick but the mystery student's book review essay critiquing Herman Melville's acclaimed novel. In such a fashion, that leans pessimistic yet honest and is the catalyst for what Charlie's desire is for all those around him, especially after the rising action of the first portion of the film. Again, my critiques are simply me acknowledging I didn't give it a 5 but that doesn't mean The Whale isn't a beautiful work of art, with some sad but true messaging throughout it.",

            "content": "It is honestly one of the best performances I've seen on film. As a noted prior film critic back during my college years, and current cinephile. I can tell you that Brendan Fraser's \"Charlie\" is nothing I've ever seen or experienced before. The performance is so emotionally taxing. If, you've dealt with depression, guilt, grief, pain, self harm. This performance will haunt you. Charlie is a very complex man, one thing to note is his optimism, empathy and love for those that share his space. \n\nAdding, the supporting characters held their own too. Ho Chung's \"Liz\" who portrays Charlie's caregiver/friend is immaculate she rightfully deserves supporting actress Oscar nod. Through her story you see someone that has suffered a huge loss, and she's caring for someone who's given up and she's perilous to stop their self destructive behavior. However all she wants is to make Charlie comfortable. Her performance is on the nose but extremely nuanced as well. If, you've loved someone that has essentially given up on life and also witnessed these same behaviors in someone else you'll feel her performance. It is devastating to witness two people you love essentially suffer the same fate. And, there's nothing you can do about it. \n\nLastly, there's Sadie Sink's \"Ellie\" her performance is visceral. And, she'll surely be splitting the votes with Ho Chung. Her performance is harsh, unrelenting and punishing. She portrays Charlie's daughter, if you've ever felt abandoned by someone you loved, a parent you'll understand. She essentially is all what Charlie lives for however she never knew. But, as a kid it's not up to her to push for a relationship it was him, that should have fought for her. Despite his limited mobility and depression, him not being in her life affected her deeply, and he deserves her wrath. I've never been abandoned by a parent, however I have people in my life who have and I understand the pain that it causes, and scars that never heals.\n\nOverall this movie is masterful and is a character/case study on our humanity and empathy. I've viewed some hot takes and read some articles where critics gave negative reviews and claimed the movie was \"fatphobic\". Those folks just want to be derisive and surly for the sake of being an other. If, your takeaway is that. You are lacking in emotional intelligence. \n\nThis film's purpose is for the viewer at the end to feel as optimistic, as Charlie. And, if you can pick yourself up through despair and grab life by the reigns, you owe to yourself and those that love you to do so.",

I would be shocked if they gave the Oscar to anyone else as this is a performance that equally parts quietly beautiful and a stellar physical transformation. Sometimes the story feels a bit uneven or repetitive but the dialogue is pretty engaging and it all comes together in a meaningful way by the final act. I felt sometimes Sadie Sink's character was meaner than was actually believable, but her performance wasn't the issue, it's more of a script problem. Nonetheless, Fraser owns the screen every second he's on it and creates a character that is deeply empathetic and ultimately flawed yet lovable. In the end, it is looking like Darren Aronofsky will yet again get another actor an Oscar, and Brendan Fraser gives us one of the easiest to-root-for-comeback stories of the year in an unmissable film.",

Brendan Fraser plays his role as Charlie perfectly- he's the man who, even when he's being confronted with something he doesn't agree with or dislikes, still keeps himself composed enough and never really raises his voice in anger at anyone. It's more realistic than many other movies in a similar ilk. I also applaud the movie for tackling an issue you don't really see outside of TLC's My 600lb Life and etc. Most overweight people are played off either as comedy or as highly confrontational about their weight with reality being most fat people know they're fat, admit they're fat, and yet are still very much real living and feeling people who are just as much deserving of a protagonist role in a story as the chiseled hunk or shapely femme fatale.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with the movie was the fact that much of the exposition is through dialog rather than flashbacks or actions. I understand that this is a modern trend in movies and that it saves on budget, but I would have enjoyed a few more instances of, say, showing the deceased partner or glimpses of Charlie's life prior to his binge eating.\n\nAll-in-all, as a fat guy myself I connected with this movie and hope to see more movies like it in the future.",

It's all a lie, and also elevates the depravity of the fallen human race.  The living God of Jesus Christ is alive and personally experienced by millions of people across the earth for generations.  Those that are not exposed to truth, and deceived by lies and perversions from man; are missing out from a powerful experience with their creator who loves them and wants to save and heal them miraculously with the truth, and who is unwilling for anyone to be left out of His eternal kingdom.  Our creator knows you more deeply than you will ever know yourself, He heals the broken hearted. :)",

Charlie doesn't seem to get pity or disgust from anyone except true strangers. We the audience are strangers at the beginning of the film. The people who truly get to know him have a deep love for him. I think most of the audience will be included in that group by the end.\n\nThere is a lot to unpack, but overall I think the entire cast understood what this film was meant to do, and it's a masterpiece. Circumstance can put us in difficult places, and even good people can hurt us. But, we can still love them, even though our world has changed. \n\nIt's hard to grow, and learn lessons in modern cinema. This film feels like an honest attempt at bringing more compassion and understanding into our world. \n\nIt made me feel something, and reflect on things. I liked it a lot. Also, beautiful work Brendan. Thanks.",

The issue is that the film adaptation strips a lot of the wry humor away that was on stage and instead revels in its misery.  We pity Charlie because Fraser is charismatic, but it teeters on being misery porn.  The movie never helps us see things from Charlie's perspective, instead, it just gawks at him and makes him as sad as possible.",

            "content": "what a fantastic bookend to Fraser's (almost) freshman effort \"Gods and Monsters\".  Certainly a tour de force for him.  One thing that I noticed critics complaining about is how 'stagey' the film is.  Well, it *was* a stage play.  Not the first time an adaptation for screen doesn't play as we think it should.  ( it should be noted that Hunter, the playwright, said in an intrview with NBC \"Darren said on day one that we're a theater company, and we dug into it as you would dig into a text. He blocked it like you would block a play with the exception of like, we weren't playing everything to an audience.\"  So there you have it. \nI have to say that my main / only complaint was an aspect of Sadie Sink's performance.  And I don't mean to say her performance was bad in any way.  (although it was clear to me from the first minute that everyone in the cast could act their pants off - and no one was going to come close to Fraser, who pulled this off with a knowledgeable grace that perhaps no one else could).  Sink gave a fine performance.  What stuck with me after, though, was how, when she was raging (often) she many times resorted to the same ragin' spot.  A quote from W Magazine: 'To capture Ellie's pain, Sink and Aronofsky nerded out on acting fundamentals—experimenting with blocking, the character's way of moving through the apartment, and the different forms in which her anger manifested.'  I submit they didn't perhaps, 'nerd-out' enough.   Granted, when almost all the action is inside the living room of the apartment, options are limited.  And granted, this is a 20-year-old actress, climbing a veritable mountain of a role.  I just would have liked to have seen something *more* come out of the 'nerd out'.  As for what many folks have noted (which maybe should be called 'squeamish factor'), as Charlie says.....it's honest.  Too honest?  Like Charlie, too large for comfort?  I can't speak to that.  I can only say that it was a huge dose of honest humanity.  And that dose was, in the main, due to Mr. Fraser.  Welcome back, dude.",

While he didn't actually gain all that weight to star in the film, his commitment to learning how to move in such a bulky and complex set of prosthetics his commendable. That isn't mentioning his engrossing portrayal of a man who has regrets and has fallen into a secluded life gorging himself to death in a dingy apartment. Yet despite all of his flaws Charlie wields an enormous empathy and recognition of positive attributes. This is apparent in his interactions with his students through the online course that he teaches and even more so in his relationship with his estranged daughter. Darren Aronofsky clearly spent a long time finding a lead that would work for the film and Brendan Fraser really REALLY works. \n\n        Speaking of Charlie's estranged daughter, Sadie Sink also brings her A game as Ellie in a portrayal of a daughter who his hurt by her father's mistakes and clearly wants nothing to do with him in the beginning of the movie. It is evident that her mother Mary (played by Samantha Morton) only sees Ellie's negative aspects but Charlie sees something more. When Mary shows Charlie how unflinchingly rude her daughter is online, the FIRST words out of Charlie's mouth are spoken in admiration of Ellie's honesty. Charlie knows that Ellie's outward behavior is indicative of a much deeper core that he wants to draw out of her, and it's so emotionally satisfying to watch. I know people will criticize the casting for grabbing at star power but I think the casting overall is really great. \n\n        The score is so menacing, yet ultimately triumphant, The story rides such an emotional wave that I forget it's all set in a dingy apartment. I somehow want to read Moby Dick now; I don't know what else to say about this movie except that more people should be going out to see this movie!",

Main character had a bad thing happen in their life and became just an awful person. He uses money to guilt his child into spending time with him instead of actually becoming someone worth spending time with! Worse - his fake optimism that exists for anything other than his own life or responsibilities. The missionary character was ridiculous and made no sense, neither did his caregivers story- trying to make you feel for them but the writing sucked. Overall, this needed a couple rewrites before ever being made and it's a shame because Fraser's acting was good for the most part. I don't think this paints a very good picture for those suffering with the kind of pain shown here- if anything, it says you're only worth something if you hoard money and time your outreach to those who should be loved ones perfectly. Further- as someone far removed from evangelicalism after growing up in it- if you're going to take that topic head on maybe consult some people on what it's actually like to be scorned by a church community. This didn't represent those people well either, and maybe that was the saddest part.",

This one involves food. These are very very very real things that people use as coping mechanisms. And they can, and do, destroy peoples lives. Body Positivity and Fat Acceptance do not have to discount the quality of storytelling that's happening with The Whale, but unfortunately, that seems to be what's happening with critics right now. \n\nThere wasn't a dry eye in the AMC theater I saw \"The Whale\" in this afternoon. Most of us stayed seated well past the credits, still stunned by the film and its performances. Employees had to ask us to leave so they could clean.\n\nI recommend seeing this film.
