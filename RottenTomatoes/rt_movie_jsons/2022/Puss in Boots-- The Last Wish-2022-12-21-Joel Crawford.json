    "summary": "This fall, everyone's favorite leche-loving, swashbuckling, fear-defying feline returns. For the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. Academy Award\u00ae nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar\u00ae nominee Salma Hayek). In their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided--against their better judgment--by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guill\u00e9n, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar\u00ae nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, \"Big\" Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).",

A great sequel. For my extended review I will speak on aspects of the movie so if you do not want to be spoiled please do not read. First I would like to talk about Puss and his growth as a character. I absolutely love the way Puss goes from a prideful, arrogant, and irresponsible cat to something more mature and less reckless.  He learns that he is not indestructible and that he feels fear. Through this realization Puss does not run away from his problems anymore and decides to instead go head first into his biggest fear. Death. Which leads me to my second aspect of the film, the antagonist. In the movie there is a bundle of side antagonist who actually have a purpose and fit the story well. Each with their own motives and the writers did a great job explaining what they were after and why in such a short time. The lead antagonist Death was by far the best aspect of not only the film but also the development of Puss. He shows that Puss is both vulnerable and scared which leads him to face his fears and fight Death head on. Such a great antagonist to a great film. I would suggest leaving the franchise as it is and to not make a third movie so that they can't potentially ruin everything the second movie brought to the table. A must see movie.",

            "content": "Puss in Boots, is, for the most part, a character that grew up with his audience. \n\nWith this sequel coming out an entire decade after its predecessor, people definitely were not expecting this release. \n\nIt's a rare thing when a sequel, especially a spin-off sequel, is met with open arms from audiences from sightings of a mere trailer, let alone an actual viewing. \n\nPuss in boots has a gorgeous stylisation, with a unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, that makes use of bold strokes, both within the literal art style and within the story beats themselves. Even the camera direction and angles used, alongside the editing is something that seriously lends to the viewing experience.\n\nWith unique character designs and bold, oversaturated use of colours, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, is a film that isn't afraid to lean into its painterly and cartoonish roots to help convey mood and emotion within scenes, in a way that does not in any way retract from the experience. It, alternatively, lifts the viewing experience up immensely with the way in which it is done. \n\nIt's a film that evokes unexpected emotion from the viewer, with scenes that tackle real life issues such as mental health struggles and even the concept of mortality and existential dread, with a realistic and raw approach, in a fashion typically not explored or portrayed in these styles of movie, at-least not with the level of care and tone-appropriate humour the film manages to utilise without denoting the character struggles.\n\nThis film also uses an interesting story telling mechanic, employed by having several characters within it that one could consider the \u2018true antagonist' of the film depending on either the viewers perspective, or the time within the story as it progresses. The villains in this movie are all very three dimensional, and the level of foreshadowing that comes alongside that, is simply astounding. \n\nAll in all, a film definitely worth a watch, and then another, to catch all of the details you might have missed the first time, thanks to that pesky yet effective foreshadowing.",

The animation style is stellar, vibrant and the character art is crisp and flourishing to see with the vfx effects. \n\nIn a more in depth dive into the films pacing, at first the Giant being set up as the 'villain' but immediately losing to Puss set up an interesting perspective of 'who is the villain'. Whilst many would argue death is the main antagonist, he also equally isn't in a sense that his existence sets up Puss's own character development, death isn't evil he is instead a major factor in a characters growth. \n\nOverall the film takes you along the ride of seeing Puss not only as a character grow but also face his own fears as well as establish a bond with others as well.",

It follows the story of Puss, the charming fugitive feline who, following a scary encounter with Death, decides to stop his adventuring as he finds out he only has one life remaining. Soon after, his journey begins one again as he finds out the mystical Magic Wishing Star exists, with the ability to grant his one wish \u2013 the wish to reclaim his nine lives of course. \n\nThis, however, is not an easy mission as other well-known fairy tale characters with a twist also battle for the wish. Overall, the epic quest is filled with hilarious, hearty and fearful moments, with an incredibly fleshed out storyline jam-packed with emotion and meaning. The film successfully explores themes of friendship, courage, love and ultimately the beauty that one life has to offer.\nIt is perfectly paced, with the main characters having sufficient and meaningful screen time, as well as an incredible dynamic with each other, and each scene having an importance and relevance. The animation is phenomenal and visually striking, and the action scenes are fast paced, smoothly transitioned, and spread out to keep the film intriguing. It is a one-of-a-kind film which has the ability to appeal to both kids and adults.\n\nI would recommend this fantastic film to people of all ages, as this level of story-telling and striking animation is rare to find in today's cinema!",

It has wild half anime visual style, crazy action scenes, fairy tale craziness (although that shtick has dropped off since the original Shrek).  The humor is not wall to wall, but organic, and almost always lands.  But more importantly, it has more mature themes of coming to grips with mortality and life priorities.

Not the best movie, The Prince of Egypt and A Beautiful Day in The Neighborhood are the best movies I've seen, but Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a must-watch. Even as someone who didn't like the first movie, I think this movie soars in every aspect. Puss, Kitty, and Perrito are a great cast of main characters, each of which feel grounded and entertaining at the same time. This movie having 3 villains could have made it feel overstuffed and like it was doing too much, but no one villain takes time from the others and they're all so well written. Jack Horner is a refreshing villain, he is completely irredeemable and evil, something that Disney should do more with its villains if they ever decide to have an actual villain again. Goldilocks and the 3 bears are incredibly sympathetic, well written characters, they're some of my favorites. Wolf was so threatening, generating chills any time he was onscreen. The animation of this movie is so stylized and gorgeous and puts what the first Puss in Boots did to shame. The music is great, \"Fearless Hero\" is one of my favorite songs from a movie, there's a reason everyone remembers this song after seeing this movie. I could go on and on, but you get the point. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is an uncontested masterpiece, by far my favorite Dreamworks movie",

Another thing is the predictable ending.

        {
            "content": "(SPOILER WARNING) (TLDR AT THE BOTTOM)\n\nThis is what animated kids movies should be like. Behind all of the bright colours of the gorgeous animation, making all of the action scenes an absolute spectacle to feast your eyes onto, is a simple plot with an absolutely massive impact. \n\nThe story is light hearted enough so kids can get enjoyment out of it, but it also treats its audience with maturity, not playing safe and having the \u2018bravery' to insert extremely deep messages. One of which is the over-arching theme of mortality and how we need to appreciate what we have.\n\nThis theme is represented beautifully through its characters. The protagonist puss in boots learns how he has taken his lives for granted. He learns this through the other characters such as Perrito. \n\nAt first glance he seems like the clich\u00e9 annoying side character for comic relief, but turns out being a warm, friendly and extremely likeable little chap. The fact that he does not have a wish, along with some other character traits, shows us and puss how he is content with the life he has, and only looks forward to his simple dreams, letting the rest develop along the way. His dream is to become a therapy dog, which is an important detail to note further into the film. \n\nOf course I cannot review this movie without mentioning Death, one of the best animated villains I have seen in a while. He shows puss his hatred towards him for taking his lives for granted, and enjoys inflicting fear into other people. In his introduction scene he is extremely close to taking puss' final life, coming as close to a scar on his forehead, with one drop of blood slowly creeping down to his shocked face. (Another example of this film's maturity) in this scene we see puss experience true fear for the first time in his life, as he is petrified of dying right there, right then. This is the moment he comes to realise how much he has taken for granted, and it was all at the fault of this menacing wolf character.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there, he constantly torments puss, showing up throughout random parts of the film, in which every appearance, send massive chills down puss' and my spine, with his truly uncanny whistle. \n\nOne of these appearances leads to what is in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in the film. Puss begins to run away in a state of absolute to panic before coming to a stop. We see that he is struggling to breathe, and his vision is blurry. Perrito is the only one there, and without any dialogue, Perrito simply rests his head on puss' chest, and in a slow decent into calmness, puss regains his control. Perrito has completed his dream of being a therapy dog. The shear realism of this scene, along with the mature dealing of the situation is what makes this scene, and this film in general truly one of a kind. \n\nTo finalise, we also have many other great characters, most notably, Goldi the three bears, the redeemable villains who learn to appreciate their family, and Big Jack Horner, the pure evil villain who does not appreciate what he has at all, to which he learns to consequences. Overall he is an extremely funny character with a \u2018charming evil' to him. All of these characters are balanced out perfectly through the films perfect pacing. Nothing seems to drag on at all.\n\nTLDR:\nThis movie is an incredible creation. All the characters are amazing in their respected ways, the animation is a true spectacle of passion and creativity, and the plot is simple, but truly impactful with the balance of light hearted humour and the downright mature themes. \n\nPersonal experience:\nI have never felt so much towards a film before, the mature themes especially hit hard and really made me look over how I spend my one life. I would honestly not recommend this film to really young audiences, because this film is best experienced when you truly understand the mature tones and messages. I absolutely adored this film, and I hope you did as well.\n\nP.S. this is my first proper review of a film, so sorry if some parts are a bit confusing, and the pacing on this is no where near as good as the films lol. There's so much to say but I don't want this to be too long. But still if you made it this far, even if skipping to the TLDR, thanks for reading, hope i expressed my opinions well enough.",

It's a film that anyone can enjoy. I don't think I really have any real big problems with this film because the animation is super vibrant the characters are lively, even the villains, Jack and death are some of the best, animated villains or even just villains in general that I have seen in a long time there's a big complaint about this movie being too crowded but I think it's just fine. The first half really makes it feel like a Puss in boots film but by the end, it really flashes out all the other characters in Waze I didn't expect, and I love this film for doing that. I really don't know how Shrek five would top this but if it does, then respect because this film was incredible I don't think it's as good as Shrek two, but it is darn close also, I watch this film with my friend after I watch this film you'll never guess what I watched after I watch this film again for a second time it's that good 9/10",

Death is horrifying and probably one of the best villains iv'e ever seen , Jack Horner is hysterical. The animation is amazing and Goldilocks and the three bears were a funny, and an emotional group with great character arcs. Perrito is a great character with funny jokes and a kind and adorable personality, and his sad backstor\n Iv'e watched this movie 3 times and on my second viewing iv'e noticed that one of the locations in the map when perrito holds it is called the river of relaxation which is where his owners nearly drowned him. Trust, anxiety, fear and emotion is handled so well and there's a lot of things for adults to enjoy. Death is an extremely dark villain and there is some bleeped swearing but that makes this movie the best. This movie took risks and after being stuck in hell for years. Hollywood doesn't respect animation. They think of it as something that is only meant for kids, but movies like this, and many other DreamWorks movies like Shrek, how to train your dragon, Kung fu panda, and Wallace and Gromit the curse of the were rabbit. And to anyone who doesn't like this masterpiece than maybe these kids movies are a little to mature for you.",

I would recommend looking into Puss in Boots as well as all the other movies tied to it made by Dream Works before you watch it. Maybe then you'll realize the dark humor that's shown in previous movies that they set you up for.

It takes a character you've probably never heard of despite being a real poetry character \"Little Jack horner\" and turns him into a heartless villain with no tragic backstory, just straight up evil, and it makes his character really funny, while still having other villains that have motives like goldilocks, who wants to have a real family, and death who wants to take puss's life because he doesn't appreciate it. Honestly, it's an amazing film with top tier animation, and it is possibly the greatest DreamWorks movie.",

It was a little scary for younger kids (2-5yr olds) as we heard some kids crying in the theater when the death character was coming to get Puss & Boots for his last life.  Over all it was one of the best kids movies and our son ranked it in his top 3 of all time.  My wife ranked it as one of her favoritesmaybe her best of all time.

Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura they're all just fantastic. I was genuinely invested in the characters and not solely on nostalgia. not that this film does a few callbacks but those aren't some cheap fan-services but something that add a little substance to the greater story.\n\nnow, the animation and the cinematography. ughhhh, it's so freaking beautiful !!! spiderverse swung in style so puss in boots could land perfecttly on it's feet. there is clearly inspiration for the animation here but instead of some cheap rip-off, it really feels like an artistic choice and comes off as an artist's fairytale come to life here. the movie literally starts with the words \"this is a fairytale...\" and lives up to it! the cinematography too is something to look out for. this film haz better shots than I can spot in a big budget Hollywood blockbuster these days. DreamWorks atleast never fails in that department and always manages to exceed expectations!\n\nto be honest, I wasn't really expecting anything from this film because the shrek cinematic universe has been near-dead for so long, but this film gives me hope. this film gives me something to put my faith in. you'd think that years of development hell would usually mean bad for a film but not for PUSS!... IN BOOTS!\n\njust go and have a good time with this. and if you haven't yet seen the trailer for the film, don't do it. just go into the film blindly like I did. It will surely give you a few surprises! in my opinion, this is the best film in the Shrek Cinematic Universe since Shrek 2, which isn't saying a lot, but it should since Shrek: Forever After was the only good film after Shrek 2.\n\nP.S.: the new DreamWorks intro is so good. I just love it!",

When he come on screen and the whistling just gave me chills it was perfect, its was like i were being hunted by the one and only death like i can feel the fear he carries. Great project for a kids movie, it add a lot of story to puss like the way he revealed his true colors at the end of the movie and the friendships he have along with the adventures he have, showing that puss is a huge character in the Shrek universe even one of the strongest he last against death in a battle. I really like how they end the movie, SPOILERS they way death gave him a chance at life because he showed who he really is and hes not that overconfident guy who think he can work alone, he shows that he have heart. Death was no longer searching for that same guy anymore he saw his true self i love that, instead of just making it where they made death surrender or die OR show that hes weak. The moral of the story and the text make a lot of sense and was inspiring truly an experience.\n\nThe villain in this movie is really scary and the whistling sound that he make gave me chills. I could feel the fear that he carry, like I was being hunted by Death himself. This movie is a great project for kids because it add a lot of story to Puss in Boots' character. We see him reveal his true colors at the end of the movie, and the friendships he have along with the adventures he go on. This show that Puss is a huge character in the Shrek universe and even one of the strongest because he last against Death in a battle.\n\nI really like how the movie end. SPOILERS Death gave Puss a chance at life because he showed who he really is and he's not just an overconfident guy who think he can work alone. He show that he have heart. Death was no longer searching for that same guy anymore because he saw Puss's true self. I love that the movie didn't just make Death surrender or die, or show that he's weak. The moral of the story and the text make a lot of sense and was truly inspiring. The movie is a great reminder that it's important to show our true selves and that we can all change for the better.\n\nIn conclusion, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great movie that you should definitely watch. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, and the villain is truly scary. The movie add a lot of depth to Puss in Boots' character, showing that he's a strong and complex character in the Shrek universe. The movie's ending is satisfying and inspiring, reminding us of the importance of being true to ourselves. If you're a fan of Shrek or just looking for a great family movie, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is definitely worth a watch.",

It doesn't harp on at the audience; it doesn't lecture, and it doesn't reiterate the typical \"environment good, white men bad\" rhetoric that Disney has been repeating since they turned awful. Puss carries a genuinely essential and universal message about making the most of your life, overcoming hardships and bad luck and coming out all the stronger for it with an appreciation for what you have. It may be hard for modern audiences to relate to putting others' needs before your own instant selfish gratification, but it's nice that that's also a theme.\n\nIt's fantastic, and I would love to see more studios returning to a more wholesome and honest approach to making movies.

            "content": "I watched the movie for the first time a little under two months ago and can I just say, I was in awe. I was in Florida, visiting my grandparents for vacation and it was one of the first things I wanted to do with my grandma while there. I had heard a lot of praise for the movie from my friends (age range 14-20) and since I'm an enjoyer of animation in the first place, I went to go see it. Now, I will say I went into this with little background of how the first movie went - I had watched it once, and that was several years prior. Good thing about The Last Wish, though - you don't need too much background information, so to an extent it can work as a standalone movie if you really want it to be. Going into the actual movie, WOW! The animation was absolutely stunning. They definitely took a lot of inspiration from Into The Spiderverse regarding the animation, mixing the 2D and 3D together. I've seen several reviews saying that made it \"hard to watch\" or \"look cheap\", but it was quite the opposite, quite dynamic! It was also very colorful and very detailed, but not too much so - \"just right\", as Goldilocks would say. Speaking of Goldilocks: regarding the characters, I think they were also very well done. It's easy to root for Puss, he's not one of those protagonists that you get bored and annoyed with, especially with Kitty and Perrito supporting him in his leading role. The villains of the movie were also very well done: Death (the wolf) was quite ominous and accurately embodied Death, \"straight up\". Goldilocks was a flawed character rather than an actual evil one, and it was nice that her story and wish was resolved at the end in a sweet way, though I will say if I have any critiques at all you could see that from a mile away. Jack Horner, though being the most unapologetically evil character, is also one of the funniest and most memorable of all. Killer design, funny lines, John Mulaney did such a great job voicing him. In fact, all of the voice actors and actresses were flawless - they fit their characters and fit the tones perfectly. \nA lot of reviews against this movie say it's too dark, but I think that's what makes this movie so beautiful. Yes, one of the main topics is mortality, and if that's not something you are ready to talk about with your child - assuming that's who you're going to bring to the movie - then do not bring them. However, if you want them to be able to discuss and see the topic of mortality in a healthy, safe way, this is definitely the movie for you. A lot of media these days struggles in how to discuss death. I think The Last Wish definitely illustrates how ominous and scary the topic of death may be, with its personification of death (the wolf character). At the same time, Puss is able to tackle his fear of death in the end. \nAll things considered, this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park. There is so much to enjoy out of this movie, from humor, fun characters, sweet moments, dynamic fight scenes (which do NOT take up the whole movie, by the way!), absolutely GORGEOUS animation, and a killer soundtrack that doesn't get enough credit...and of course, the fact that there is a lot to think about after watching it. \nI highly recommend this movie. Treat yourself and/or your loved ones and go watch it.",

Great storytelling, great villains, excellent character journeys and a kid's film that has more profound and more mature themes that even 12A and 15 films lack. While I admit the Wolf may be slightly too scary for the age range it appeals to in its more vibrant child-like audience, I think it fits into a wider family film that has its laughs for the kids while not being afraid to make an emotional effect on the grown-ups. Kids and grown-ups love this film alike, just what a FAMILY film should do. Family films are now more kid's films that grown-ups watch out of necessity, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is hopefully the start of animation going back to being a family occasion and not just a kids-only appeal. Dreamworks could be onto the renaissance of animation, and if the same team is working on Shrek 5, I am definitely on board.",

            "content": "This is the first time where I have seen the audience scores aligned with the critic scores. Normally, I would say critic scores are trying to be cooperate-friendly and be as nice as possible to the movie(the exact opposite of what a critic is ironically), but I have to say, the critic and audience score is very justified. I may or may not update this post, because I have only seen this movie once.\n\nSo right now, I am going to be upfront, and write my critiques out of the way so I can talk about the good stuff after.\n\nSo, I don't know if it's the effects of my sensory issues and loud movie theater speakers clashing, but it induced a bit of anxiety in me. It could've just be the first few minutes kind of rushing through along with other effects, or it was just loud speakers and my sensitive ears colliding. I really don't know, I would have to rewatch so other time to see. The first few minutes are kind of just a fuzzy memory to me.\n\nI also don't know why they didn't just address the problem between Puss and Soft-paws earlier in the movie. There isn't necessarily anything bad about it, but I feel it would've been better addressed earlier.\n\nThat's really my only concerns, not even a problem really.\n\nI think that all the villians are all pretty solid for there being multiple villains. You know what. Scratch that. They aren't just solid villains. They are all really good villains. Plain an simple. \n\nJack Horner isn't trying to be relatable at all. He doesn't have some sad back story that tries to get you to sympathize with him. He is just pure evil. He believes only he should be entitled to his power, doesn't give a damn about anyone else, and would do anything to get what he want, even if it means needlessly putting others lives at risk, even those who dedicate there services to him. It is a bit more refreshing to see that we aren't being guilt tripped through a story, and we are being shown that evil isn't made because of bad things. It can just be made in anyone, regardless. Plain and simple. \n\nHe also isn't 2 dimensional either. He might not have a conscious telling him what right and wrong is, but you are shown he has a reason for doing it, even if you don't understand his ideologies or reasonings. It is showcased in ways that you understand what he is doing and why. He knows that once he gets his hands on the power, no one will be able to stop him anyway, and he is confident he can get it.\n\nOhhh\u2026 and death. Death is just amazing to watch on screen. He literally gave me the chills anytime he was on screen, and I love it. That's how you right a villain. When his presence on screen is so intense, that you get chills just seeing him. He is just a badass. Through and through. Nothing else. And I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way. He is a total badass. Straight. Up.\n\nHe has so many memorable quotes, I just can't help but reference them as I am writing this review! He is genuinely that fun and memorable as a villain!!! \n\nHe also has a motive that isn't just clear like Jack Horners, but you understand why. And you don't just understand why, his motives are almost justified. You almost root for him at times.\n\nNot to mention Puss in Boots arc where he goes from arrogant ass who doesn't truly value his lives until he realizes he doesn't have any to lose, to one who would like to spend his life wisely and happily, realizing what life is.\n\nEveryone going after the wish has a reason to go after the wish, and then they realize they had what they wished for, and it's just so good. It shows that you could learn to look at what you have and not take it for granted.\n\nI could go on for hours and hours why this movie was such a good movie. But I bet you probably came here for a shorter review just to see if this movie. You didn't come for a whole essay. So I am going to cut it short here and save everyone including myself time. This movie is going to be one of the highest ratings I may ever give to a movie. It's that good. Watch it as soon as possible.",

Puss in Boots, voiced once again by the incomparable Antonio Banderas, is as swashbuckling and charming as ever. And the addition of new allies like Dulcinea (voiced by the delightful Tiffany Haddish) adds depth and heart to the story.\n\n\u0e07\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a DreamWorks movie without stunning animation and plenty of humor. \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" delivers on both counts, with breathtaking visuals and plenty of laughs to keep audiences of all ages entertained.\n\nIn a world where animated movies are a dime a dozen, \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" stands out as a true gem.

The Last Wish is just amazing all around and I'm really happy now that more stylized animation is being used by other studios in a really cool way. This movie was one of the last movies that I thought was going to be really good but I'm very happy that it went above and beyond what I thought it was going to be. The story is pretty cliche and generic yes but it's everything around the story that makes this film so good. The animation is incredibly. The Spider-Verse style works very well for this film and it still stands out from Spider-Verse in its own unique way. The characters and their own respective arcs are great. There really isn't one weak character here. Puss himself gets some excellent development and his journey of grabbing with the concept of death is very emotional and well written. Kitty Softpaws also has a really good arc and chemistry with Puss and Perrito has some really great moments. All of the villains here are great. Goldilocks and the 3 bears all have a good arc and Jack Horner is one of the funniest characters ever included in an animated film and works amazingly well as the irredeemable villain but the real standout here is Death. Death is probably one of if not the best Dreamworks villain. To have Death be personified and built up the way it is in the film is just something else. His interactions with Puss were always amazing. The humor was great as well. Pretty much every joke from Jack landed and all the other jokes were really great as well. Everyone involved with this film felt like they really cared about the characters and the story and that's what makes the film so great.

The animation was superb, with a slight action style that added a unique spark to the already beautiful visuals, which had such a variety of themes. Plus, the character design. I'm still getting over how amazing the wolf looked, absolutely horrifying but so fun to watch. The direction was one of the best I've seen in any animated movie, with stunning shots that I'm shocked other films haven't used. The worldbuilding was so compelling, with elements of fantasy and adventure so interesting and thought-provoking, and ideas so brilliant I've truly never seen anything like it. The voice acting was perfect, casting celebrities that are actually good at voice acting, and actors I've never seen before that still were great. The characters were set up so well, with emotional sequences and character building that was heartfelt and realistic, despite the movie being about talking animals and fictional creatures. The comedy was wonderful, with Disney parodies and fairy tale references, plus sequences that were extremely funny. There's practically nothing wrong with this movie- everything was so riveting and fun to watch, always entertaining you while keeping you in suspense. Overall, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, animated or not. I was invested throughout the entire experience, rooting for characters in their toughest moments, and genuinely tearing up multiple times. This movie is outstanding.",

I never tought that I, who watches in my age World War movies and documenteries would feal such passion towards an animated movie. This movie made me watch \"The Adventures of Puss in Boots\" andthe original movie again. The love between Puss and Kitty or Puss and Dolcinea is for me even comparable with Hiccup and Astrid.

I didn't have high expectations - I decided on a whim to see it after two recommendations in separate, unrelated YouTube videos. I didn't even remember this is a sequel. Nevertheless, it was fantastic, and a fantastic standalone film. The animation style is delightful, and similar in many ways to Into The Spiderverse, with an overall painterly, comic book aesthetic and creative use of variable frame rate and colour. The story brilliantly balances real heart with cracking jokes. The characters are all super endearing and energetically acted - suave Puss and his old flame Kitty, effervescent Perrito, relentlessly, comedically cruel Jack Horner, surprisingly familial Goldi and her three bears, and the spectre following Puss everywhere. The story is interesting, taking someone who has grown to think himself untouchable and challenging him to stop thinking about himself for once, and along the way a loner learns to trust again, a dog with the saddest backstory finds a loving family, and an adopted child comes to appreciate her found family. So much else to love - the Shrek cameos, the touching portrayal of a panic attack, the in-universe theme song (\"He is your favourite fearless hero\"), the touches of anime in fight choreography. I can't wait to see it again.",

Each and every part seems to contribute to a lesson or meaning, and really builds each of the characters that we see in the short amount of time (less than 2 hours). The buildup is solid and the ending is amazing.\n\nThe voice acting is flat down some of the best I've ever heard for any animated movie, fantastic and describes each character exactly. I actually never noticed this about any other movies but it really stood out to me from this one. \n\nOverall the movie is a 10/10, from a solid critics viewpoint.",

            "content": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a masterpiece. The movie was over 10 years in the making and it shows. Not a single part of it feels rushed, forced, or poorly done. It has gotten stellar reviews on all fronts because the movie is flawless in every regard. It's no wonder that a fantastically executed depiction of one of the most consistently beloved characters in history makes for the greatest movie of all time.\nThe movie utilizes an animation style inspired by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a movie similarly praised by critics, nigh on universally for its fantastic art. Dreamworks used this same system in the production of Puss in Boots, another example of why the decade-long wait after its original announcement contributed to how truly spectacular the movie is. The painting-like style of art created an atmosphere that felt very much like a fairy-tale as opposed to the just-off-reality vibe that CGI movies of the past had, or the totally devoid of realism style of completely hand-drawn movies such as Aladdin or the Lion King. Dreamworks gave us the best that there is in the animated world by refusing to hold back on the art style. The fact that all movies with higher acclaim amongst critics happen to be live action only serves to illustrate why this movie isn't considered better by so called professionals.\n\tThis art-style helps contribute to the simply stunning fight scenes in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. However, the visuals are not the only thing that makes the swordsmanship in this movie stand out. Unlike other movies using swords, The Last Wish holds a great degree of accuracy to real life swordsmanship. In every single fight, it is clear who is attacking who, who is on offense, who is on defense. Puss can be seen parrying, and then counter attacking with a well executed riposte just like in real fencing. Puss' fight with Death at the end of the movie is the most spectacular fight throughout, with both characters showing off the true height of their ability, utilizing their respective advantages in speed, dexterity, strength, size, cunning, and more and not just pointlessly slapping sticks together between them. What's more, Puss' use of a so-called \u2018gatito blade' in his offhand, is highly consistent with the use of parrying daggers, which were quite popular in Italy and Spain for use in rapier fencing. Such historical accuracy is quite rare in TV shows and movies, and for it to be found in a children's movie where that is rarely a concern just goes to show how much effort was put into the movie. Finer details such as these serve to show just how great of flawless masterpiece this movie really is. What's more, every fight in the movie serves a purpose other than just violence for the sake of violence. They help create exposition, advance the plot, and develop characters, whether that be by showing \u2018Big' Jack Horner's ruthlessness, the strengthening of Three Bears familial bonds, or galvanizing Puss to be brave and value his lives and the time he has with his friends.\nThe message of the story is found in the final fight scene. Without having to be explicitly said, the message is still clear, you should cherish every second. The movie also has much to say about how it's ok to be afraid, a lesson many young boys, and all men really, need to hear. It has a flawless and nuanced depiction of a panic attack, something that can't be said for most movies, and shows us that we don't always have as much control as we thought we did, and that's ok. Therein lies the elegance of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. It is, at its heart, a children's movie, and therefore has the obligation to leave the audience with a clear and positive message. This is no easy task for a movie to accomplish without being heavy handed. Luckily, for the Last Wish, the movie is far from heavy handed, with every message in the story being flawlessly woven into the very essence of the movie, instead of being carelessly stapled on top like so many other movies do. The reward of being appropriate for all audiences and for leaving them all with a positive message is incalculable and one of the many reasons Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is greater than any other movie, despite their higher approval amongst critics.\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish is a work of art. It is not only accessible to all audiences, but entertaining to them as well. It surrounds a beloved character that is a known-quantity in his beloved status amongst all, and does him justice in innumerable ways. The movie's attention to detail, and sheer visual beauty set it apart from any other animated movie ever made, while its character development, positive messages, and ability to stay within a PG rating puts it far ahead the dark live action movies that dominate the highest rated spots amongst movie review websites. Dreamworks didn't hold back on this one and, on God, it shows.",

The animation style was refreshing for the franchise, the humor was more balanced with the character-driven story, and despite maintaining three different villains the film feels solid rather than clunky. Instead of frequent pop culture references and dodgy jokes that pad for time in the later Shrek films, this Puss in Boots sequel weaves the influences of classic Spaghetti Westerns and swashbuckler films with a family adventure storyline and affirmative, positive themes about appreciating life and those around you. It knows when to be lighthearted and when to be serious, and introduces us to one of the coolest original villains in family animation - a wolf embodiment of death - by not holding back on the menacing aura and instead focusing on it; hopefully the sense of danger will encourage other franchises to stop oversanitizing their films. If I were in the movie's target audience, it would probably be a film I would swear by for the rest of my life (sort of like Shrek 2), but in this case I'll just call it a very good family movie that came out of nowhere.\n\nI hope you're all ready for more Shrek because now it's basically guaranteed to happen. And they will likely be disappointing. (3.5/5)",
