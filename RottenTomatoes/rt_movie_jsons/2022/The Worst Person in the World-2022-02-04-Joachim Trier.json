            "content": "Joachim Trier's directorial debut was dedicated to starting a trilogy that connects through the town he was raised in, sprinkling existential questions about love, ambition, memory and identity. It's just a matter of time till one picture's inclusion of an interconnected slate pops up under the radar, then later discover other works involved and possibly intrigue. His latest caps his connective discourses under evident relativity, relevantly defining a worst trait in a person as titularly stated and narratively explained.\n\n\"The Worst Person in the World\" is Julie, who lets her indecisiveness constantly change her unclear paths towards a career choice, even desires by her unclear quest for love. Simply put, she's undecided. Divided in fourteen chapters, including a prologue and an epilogue, the film chronicles four years of her life stationed in Oslo as she finds meaning and assurance of who she really is and how to figure out what she truly wants whilst romantically assisted.\n\nUsually a career path is the primary focus that sorts out other crucial choices, while romance provides blissful support that reassures against loneliness. Trier flips it in another direction poised to inspire Julie about how much the self should be valued without any deposition towards the choices she made picks as well. But then the narrative functions like an incoherent romance you lose yourself in, without justifying an uninteresting romance novel you decided to check out only nothing been proven satisfyingly. The chemistries are pure with fine performances enhanced by their thematic interactions, but their romance doesn't stir much regarding indecision as a topic. Though genuinely detracts from the formula, not much is worth engaging in except for the theming that seemingly been demoted as secondary.\n\nTrier's third story of his anthological trilogy based in his hometown \"The Worst Person in the World\", scores over its thematic communication with performative enriching points, but the romantic focus, albeit the supportive motive, lessens the delivery down to just an average acceptance.

            "content": "The final instalment of Joachim Trier's \u2018Oslo' trilogy has finally arrived. \u2018The Worst Person in the World' is a powerful affair that flips the idea of a traditional rom com on its head. Following an indecisive main character who brings you along with her on a 12-chapter quest for to find herself and what she wants from life. \u2018The Worst Person in the World' firmly establishes itself as one of 2021's best films right from the get-go.\n\nJulie (Renate Reinsve) is a young woman who finds herself trying to navigate her way through life after a life-changing epiphany which results in her deciding to become a photographer. She first meets Aksel, (Anders Danielsen Lie) a successful comic book artist and the two hit it off, despite Aksel being 15 years her senior. They then enter a relationship together but before long their mundane relationship is interrupted when Julie meets Eivind (Herbet Nordrum), their impromptu meeting results in Julie ending things with Aksel but leaving the chance for them to reconcile. Eivind and Julie soon form their own relationship, quickly forming an ardent bond. What comes next is an emotionally rich journey that forces Julie to take an in-depth look at who she really is.\n\nRenate Reinsve gives an awe-inspiring performance in the lead role, her absence from of the major Best Actress line-ups this awards season is painfully noticeable. Reinsve leads cast that also all give marvellous performances \u2013 Anders Danielsen Lie's portrayal of Julie's ex-lover is arguably one of the most gutting things about \u2018The Worst Person in the World'. However, the crux of their performances comes when Julie is faced with a major dilemma, turning to Aksel for advice as she faces a tough decision. What follows is an incredibly raw, fragile sequence that tugs at your heartstrings. These wonderful performances allow for Joachim Trier and Eskil Vogt's magnificent screenplay to be brought to the screen.\n\n\u2018Riders of Justice' cinematographer Kasper Tuxen immerses audiences into the city of Oslo with the help of 35mm film and gorgeous visuals. Tuxen takes full advantage of the Oslo skyline effortlessly integrating it alongside the characters. These easy-on-the-eye visuals are a part of what makes \u2018The Worst Person in the World' feel like a masterclass in filmmaking alongside the brilliant screenplay and sensational performances. The film is one of more refreshing features surrounding the 2022 awards season, what it lacks in not being a charming biopic or star-studded action flick, it makes up for in complex characters that audiences can resonate with. It also isn't as clean cut as your typical rom com, Joachim Trier brilliantly bends the rules of the overdone genre, giving it a dark twist that brilliantly works in the film's favour.\n\nJoachim Trier weaves themes of feminism and womanhood into the undertones of \u2018The Worst Person in the World', creating an in-depth character study of one woman and her search to find out who she really is, and what kind of person she wants to be. This is a film that forces you as a viewer to investigate yourself and your own relationships \u2013 do you see things through to the end or do you give up halfway through? Acclaimed director Joachim Trier brings audiences a film that becomes an instant classic from the first viewing. \u2018The Worst Person in the World' is a poignant and mesmerising film that is the perfect way to close Trier's \u2018Olso' trilogy, and well-deserving of its two Academy Award nominations.",

Things can be learned from this and it rises to the level of all great art by transcending expectations while at the same time going just as far as it needs to and not one bit further.

The film focuses on her relationships with two men, a fiercely intelligent writer of comic books and an amiable barista, successfully delving into remarkable highs and devastating lows, and ultimately ending in tragedy, that evolve over time.

There are amusing moments, uplifting moments almost and also more sad and even poignant moments too but overall I quite enjoyed this. I thought the characterisation was good.

            "content": "Text: This Norwegian film, The Worst Person in the World, is a romantic comedy that portrays the shattering of human minds, especially in the 20s or 30s of years youths. The protagonist of the movie Julie wants to experience life in her own way but is restricted by some of the personal liabilities in her life. Her mind is getting changed according to her perception of life. She fell in love with many people and as well as she shares a bed with them but for a short span of time she just attracted to a Comic book writer Aksel and they lead a living together life. But at some point, she was just attracted to another man and avoids Aksal but at that time Aksal was so much fond of her and it looks very disappointed for him to leave her. But that relationship with Julie (with Eivind) doesn't was a steady one which also leads to a collapse. So in this sense, the conclusion of the movie relies on the continuing journey of Julie to the next level of her life. She is not affected by the failure in her life because she believes that it all happened to her only because of her own decisions. At the early stage, she always thought about her perspective of life that surrounded her, and that's why she points out that \"I feel like a spectator in my own life\". She wants to rid of that spectatorship from her life. Is she successful, is the question that remarks the entirety of the movie.\nSummary: Success or failure; the question for Julie",

            "content": "This fantastic film speaks honestly about intimate relationships, full of imperfection, deep knowingness, and pain, feelings that are familiar to anyone who has been through a break-up. We journey through life with Julie, a captivating, creative, sometimes selfish but ultimately likeable lead who oscillates constantly between searching and settling. Joachim Trier is skilled at bringing us along for this ride though her internal and external worlds with the help of playful storytelling devices; in one scene, we are treated to a visceral magic mushroom-fuelled Freudian journey through the psyche. In another, time literally stops as the unfolding of a new relationship eclipses all else. In these moments we see inside Julie's mind; Trier wants us to understand his characters and even in moments of sudden upheaval, we understand their motives. The characters are given self-awareness and intelligence, which is part of what makes the film's conflicts so compelling to watch. In one of the most heartbreaking scenes, Julie tells her lover, \"I love you and I don't love you\" and we are there with her, experiencing her conflict, contradictory but decisive. Humour has a place in the film, too, but to great relief it is never used to break tension; difficult emotions are given time and space to be processed. We are also invited us to think about intergenerational trauma, feminism, \u2018wokeness', nostalgia and psychoanalysis, if we want to (these occur through casual dinner party conversations, off-handed comments and a matter-of-fact narrator). We certainly come away from the film with more than we bargained for. We remember that life is messy, unpredictable and wonderful.",

The Worst Person in the World may not be earth-shattering in scope, but it's a testament to the authenticity of the drama that the film can be so impactful with so few characters. \n\nThis Joachim Trier project is particularly hard-hitting given the naturalistic and empathetic development of its conflict, with Renate Reinsve's Julie exhibiting relatable insecurities and uncertainty, which in turn fuels major life-changing events with lasting and profound implications for both herself and those around her. Then there's the film's depiction of love, simultaneously subject to human frailty and potentially resilient beyond measure. Taken together, it's an interesting and potentially devastating taste of life's unpredictability, of connections made and lost through circumstances both beyond and within our control. Even though throwing in a character with a sudden and unexpected terminal disease feels a bit like cheating, there's a core to this film that feels honest and real. \n\nSolid direction and very good acting, I only wish the trailer didn't spoil the 'frozen time' sequence.

Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair called it \"exquisite, wistful (and downright sad)\", praising the cast performances and Trier's writing. In his review for IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of B and commended Reinsve's performance, stating \"If Julie is less of a character than a vividly realized archetype, Reinsve didn't get the message.\" Vanity Fair and The Atlantic declared The Worst Person in the World to be the best film of 2021.\n\nThis is Joachim Trier\u00b4s third film in his \"Oslo Trilogy\", following \"Reprise\" (2006) and \"Oslo, August 31st\" (2011). The film premiered in competition at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival to widespread critical acclaim, with Renate Reinsve winning the award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. At the 94th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best International Feature Film and Best Original Screenplay. (via Wikipedia) The film has a prologue, 12 chapters and a epilogue. As a fan of Joachim Trier\u00b4s \"Reprise\" and specifically \"Oslo, August 31st\" I was glad to see that he finally was closing the \"Oslo Trilogy\" with \"The Worst Person in the World\" and reading about all the accolades and praise I was really looking forward to see it. First of all, the acting is of a very high standard and Renate Reinsve gives us a splendid performance. And Anders Danielsen Lie is great as always. The story is hardly unique and I personally thought that the film is a bit scattered with all the chapters that creates an unbalance. Maybe that was Trier\u00b4s aim as Julie\u00b4s life is scattered. However, that is an issue to my mind since the flow becomes broken. I think as well that that the film is a bit flatlined, there\u00b4s no emotional punch like in \"Oslo, August 31st\" which I miss at least. I can relate to Julie in certain of her actions, but is she likeable? Not really, which makes you less engaged. And that goes for Aksel as well. I had high hopes and they were not fully met. It\u00b4s a solid film, but not Trier\u00b4s best in my book.",

This is a fantasy by two men about two men who are redeemed by the love of a woman who has no life outside of her relationships with them. \"The worst person\" of the title is the first of these men, a somewhat sexist gen-x artist who takes her for granted, and then, apparently is redeemed in her eyes by getting terminal cancer and telling her she was the best thing to ever happen to him. Reinsve's character is not a person, she is a device designed to make the film appear less sexist.\n\nIt's such a shame, because so much of the film is really beautiful.

Instead, what we get is a charming female-centric film, which considering it's co-written by two men, Trier & Eskil Vogt, happily doesn't feel awkward or disingenuous. There's certainly notes of early Woody Allen/Annie Hall here, before it moves subtly into Greta Gerwig/Noah Baumbach territory (Marriage Story and Frances Ha come to my mind), especially when romance is replaced with the cold hard facts of co-habitation. Which makes the final act dip into melodrama and Love Story territory a little hard to fathom and tonally slightly jarring. However, what holds everything beautifully together is, firstly, Trier's flair as an imaginative film-maker. Everyone who watches this will find that scene with a city of people frozen mid-action a romantically delightful moment, which also turns out to be the turning point of the film, but there are other smaller moments (like the hallucination sequence or an air-drumming scene in hospital) to cherish and makes me appreciate what a meticulous and visually fascinating director Trier is. Secondly, and equally important, are the tremendous performances, by Anders Danielsen Lie, who's very good even if he has sympathy on his side for his tender portrayal of Askel; and Reinsve who's spectacular, making an otherwise irritating character, understandable and almost loveable despite her flaws. Calling this an anti-romcom just because it's about a young woman going in and out of relationships seems doing this a disservice. For me, it's a story about someone who grew up and found herself who just happens to be female, for a change.",

I'd like to single out Anders Danielsen Lie, who is also in another 2021 release I love. He's such a lyrical, almost unreal presence in this movie. I don't know how he and the director Joachim Trier pulled this character off without going sentimental and making the character's dramatic purpose obvious.  One thing though: I didn't need this epilogue. I think the film would have benefitted from an ending with her walking the streets of Oslo at night and then welcoming the sun. A chapter in her life has ended, and she might feel mature enough to make some real choices. I think this would have worked better.

I could definitely find a way to relate to most of the characters, who all came across as uniquely interesting and well developed, and I thought the performances were excellent all around. The dialogue between these characters was probably most important to the film's success, and felt incredibly authentic, easily capturing my attention and focus, allowing me to feel at times like I was in the actual room. I definitely was getting some \"Before...\" trilogy vibes at times and even though the films were still quite different in many ways, I remember being left with some of the same emotions during the credits.\n\nAnd sometimes, similar to Julie, it can be a stronger experience just to feel things, without having to try to frame every emotion through words.\n\n*2022 Theater #6",

She doesn't quite know what she wants to do as a career, so she goes in and out of education and professions.  She also doesn't know what she wants from a partner, so she bails on relationships when things get difficult.  This movie focuses on two of her main relationships, one with Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie), and one with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum).  Now other than the Oscar buzz surrounding this, it was the title that grabbed me with this one.  It just reaches out and gets your attention immediately, so I knew I had to check this out even without knowing a ton about it.  I think this works better for home viewing than in a theater, but I did ultimately end up liking it.  Now I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that I expected this woman to be a worse person.  Yes, she can be selfish from time to time, but it is still relatable to be unsure if you're in the right line of work or with the person you're supposed to be with for the rest of your life.  It's the weight of expectations put on by yourself that can make you feel like the worst person in the world.  Julie is a flawed person, and this is very much a character study, so I can see people having a disconnect if they are looking for something to latch onto.  For me, that wasn't a bother, and I liked the poignant moments that get peppered throughout.  This is a very existential movie, and I found it similar to the beloved-by-everyone-but-not-by-me Drive My Car, only I found this script to be more relatable.  Because it gets contemplative at times, I did feel the length, which gets exacerbated by the fact that this is divvied up into fourteen chapters and tells you as such at the start.  It made me check the clock when I didn't even want to, which is why I think this would work better to watch this when it hits streaming.  That way, you can watch 3-4 chapters and take a small break as you would do with an engaging miniseries.  The Worst Person in the World is a smaller and quieter story, but I did always relate even when my attention wavered.  They always bring it back home with a good point or a striking line of dialogue, which is what I appreciated most about this film.  I also highly enjoyed the moments of magical realism that they slip into; you can see it in the trailer, and it makes you wish that was more prevalent.  Overall, I can give this a low recommendation.",

There was a time that I wouldn't watch anything with subtitles. Thankfully I was given multiple opportunities to overcome this bias and have, in return, seen so many films that I would never have seen otherwise.\n\nI don't hand out five-star reviews regularly; they're reserved for indeed what are my favorite films each year. To put it in perspective, the only other film I gave five stars to this past year was \"Last Night in Soho.\" Cinema is personal, and I don't know what makes one better than the next to each person; no one does. My favorite films from last year maybe someone else's least favorites. That's fine; if we all liked the same movies, the world would be a pretty dull place.\n\nThis film defines why I do the Oscar Death Race each year. I know that not everyone is a big fan of the Oscars (I currently have a pretty big issue with them handing out what they consider lesser awards before the ceremony, but that's a topic for another post.) You don't have to be the biggest fan of The Academy to appreciate still the films that get nominated. Each year I get to watch so many notable movies, I've been on the hunt for this one for a while now, and I was ecstatic when I saw that it was being released at a theater local to me.\n\nRenate Reinsve (Julie), the lead of the film, and the glue that holds it together give what I would consider one of the year's best performances. The fact she wasn't nominated for best actress blows my mind. I will say that The Academy has made some significant strides this year, getting international films nominated in multiple categories (especially with this and \"Drive My Car.\") Reinsve was able to capture my imagination precisely by giving a realistic performance. I felt like I was almost watching a documentary rather than an acting performance. It should go without saying that a lot of this appreciation indeed goes to the writers and director.\n\nThe other two most vital roles in the film were Anders Danielsen Lie (Aksel) and Herbert Nordrum (Eivind), who played critical roles that worked together to complete the story. I was shocked how both were able to go from villains to heroes in my eyes throughout the film. The film is beautifully broken into 12 parts (as well as a prologue and epilogue) with a runtime of just a little over two hours; it makes the entire movie very digestible to any audience.\n\nAs I've covered before, I'm not a massive fan of films that are artsy just because, thankfully, we see a grounded approach to the imagination here. A few scenes are \"beyond belief\" but are given reasons as to why. They're not just fantastical without purpose; I have a much higher level of appreciation when there are intentional decisions to film. This allows a film that's based in reality but one that lets your imagination wander.\n\nThe only ironic aspect of the film I found odd was that Oslo (the city the film primarily took place) is the largest city in Norway; however, Julie repeatedly runs into people she knows. I rarely run into people I know, and I live in a much smaller city. It was just an amusing little bit I picked up on.\n\nFor more reviews and my YouTube channel, please visit linktr.ee/Overlyhonestmoviereviews\n\nFollow me on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.

            "content": "This is my 28th film of the festival and easily my favorite. I definitely pushed myself too far this festival and hit a wall, and staying at the worst airbnb imaginable where I could only get two hours of sleep didn\u2019t help. I spent most of the morning being fucking miserable and just trying to stay awake. Then this movie started and I had goosebumps from the first frame to it\u2019s last. I felt invigorated for every minute of it\u2019s 2 hour runtime and just sat there with a dumb smile on my face even during the film\u2019s most painful moments because I knew I was watching something that would mean a lot to me for years to come.\n\nI don\u2019t have any analysis rn, I\u2019m just happy when a movie can make me feel this way. Oslo, August 31st was one of my favorite films of the 2010s and somehow Joachim Trier has crafted something at a completely different register but every bit it\u2019s equal. This is easily my favorite film of the festival, it\u2019s gonna be near impossible to beat as my film of the year. Movies rule, man.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAlright, it\u2019s been 2 days so I\u2019ll expand a bit. If you follow the work of Joachim Trier, since his 2006 debut, Reprise through 2012\u2019s Oslo, August 31st, and finally this film he\u2019s been creating a very loose trilogy defined more by themes, location, and actors than by some overarching narrative. And the stories he\u2019s been telling have simply been these kind of very true to life films about young people trying to find their way in the world and more specifically in the city of his native Oslo. He\u2019s had a real knack for capturing the kind of experience of being a millenial better than probably any filmmaker I can think of and has done so with a real empathy and humanity. Sometimes those portraits of life can be really bleak like his prior film Oslo, August 31st but they all feature moments of breathtaking beauty and this is perhaps his warmest and most beautiful yet. \n\nIt features all the ideas essential to his work of identity, nostalgia, love, ambition, and interpersonal relationships with as much care as his work ever has, but with his age, he seems to now have enough distance to both be wiser in his observations and find the inherent comedy in the concerns that seem to dominate our lives in the moment. In this one it centers around Julie, a young woman who having just turned 30 finds herself still unsure of her place in the world, unable to find reassurance in her professional or personal life of where she\u2019s going. And as we see the next few years of her life the film doesn\u2019t cop out and provide easy answers but ends with a resolution that I found completely beautiful and extremely touching.\n\nIdk, I\u2019m still on a high from this one, I\u2019ve sat here for two days now just listening to the soundtrack on repeat desperately googling for a release date so I can see it again.\n\nAs of now, this is my first 5 star film of the decade.",

This film brings to mind other scandinavian filmmakers of the past.  The starkness of the lives at a point of interruption with emotional purging is the core of this film that is made of a continum of vignettes.  It is book-like, the chapters are a forward and backward glance int o the characters and their private worlds and how they journey through them.  I highly recommend this film as it keeps you going where some others have not had that forward thrust to finding the ideal life.  There is no ideal life, just the skeletal frame upon which man creates his own stories and truths. Like Ibsen, we become more aware of the needs of a female in today's world, which like Ibsen, who broke barriers of the femal strength and breaking away from what is supposed to be the normal, we are taken step by step into a plot that swerves and then is accomplished.  This is a wonderful story of sexual admissions and omissions.",

The film had a universal humanity that spoke of all of the complexities of life. The performances were spot on and the narrative flowed seamlessly even though the film had \"chapters\".

The main protagonist is merely an underdeveloped sketch of an actual character.  She's an indecisive young Norwegian woman who we are told has above-average intelligence and beauty but works at a book store.  Apparently, she is a great writer also because she likes to write about having sexual experiences with flaccid men.  In its greatest sin, the movie predictably stumbles into themes of life and death at the end, but fate interferes with her having to make an actual choice.  It is as if the director didn't want the young ingenue ruined by any actual characterization.  \n\nDo not see this boogie meandering garbage  - it will only make you lose faith in the film criticism community and doubt your own sanity.  To be fair, there is one scene that resonated with me, a dream sequence where the lead flung a tampon at her father's face.  This movie is the tampon flung at all our faces.",

            "content": "Joachim Trier's Oslo-trilogy comes to an end in its third decade. In Reprise (2006), Oslo, August 31st (2011) and The Worst Person in the World (2021) all tell different stories that focus primarily on interpersonal relationships and study them with great attention to detail. In the case of this black-humoured romance, the focus is on the inner life of the protagonist Julie, who over the course of four years increasingly asks herself questions of meaning about her own existence and the relationships with her fellow human beings.\n\nWhile the Norwegian capital is the setting for the events in the trilogy of the same name, Anders Danielsen Lie is the other constant in Trier's unrelated three-parter. In all the films he plays an essential role and is directly involved in the central relationships. Here he is Julie's distinctly older boyfriend, Aksel. An artist who devotes his entire career to a children's comic series with a cat as the title character, giving free rein to his artistic vision. His character is initially established as merely Julie's better half, but transforms as he progresses until he suddenly becomes controversial. If it weren't for Lie's charismatic performance, Aksel would even be despicable and unlikable. However, you never think of him that way because there is so much more slumbering in this person than the abstracted artist. Watching him play with mimicry and emotion breaks your heart and makes it beat faster at other moments. Foremost responsible for this is the chemistry Lie shares with his scene partner Renate Reinsve. Reinsve is the true revelation as the internally torn Julie. Although her decisions often leave you shaking your head, I could completely relate to her in every situation. Because Julie does what most people in ambivalent relationships completely forget to do: She listens to herself. She is a self-determined person who makes decisions only out of her own intention. This either means that you can never really relate to this character and take her to your heart or, as in my case, you find her totally relatable. Perhaps this was also the reason why I always emotionally enjoyed putting myself in Julie's head and followed her every move with great interest.\n\nThe grandiose acting would never have such an imposing effect without an equally strong screenplay. Joachim Trier has understood how to write and direct this story as real as possible. This is not only due to insanely authentic dialogue (The break-up scene!), but also to the way he brings certain narrative strands together. What some interpret as poorly structured is, for me, very organically woven together. I realise that the division into chapters in films bothers a lot of people. In The Worst Person in the World, however, they help me to stay fully engaged with the characters and their developments. The chronology of the script makes the film feel very down to earth and not at all pretentious. In the end, The Worst Person in the World is an unassuming romance that, like so many films in this genre, doesn't try to explain relationships with a raised finger, but simply lets them happen - and I credit Joachim Trier for that.",

Renate Reinsve plays Julie.  When we first meet her she is a medical student.  She isn't fully engaged to her studies, so she drops out to pursue psychology.  She starts dating one of her professors and moves onto wanting to be a photographer.  She shifts again when she starts dating a Aksel, a comic book artist several years older than she.   The film is romantic and at times a comedy, but it is not a romantic comedy. The characters and situations are far too complex and thought provoking.  Julies biggest crime is believing that excitement comes in trying something new.  The beginning is better than the routine. The beauty off the film comes in watching her mature to a point when she recognizes that the true rewards come with time and are not easily earned.  And that life isn't about setting reset when the thrill of the chase is done.",
