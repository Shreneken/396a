Here the focus is on the purpose of films and why people are drawn to them, whether they are watching or making them. We can also see the impact that films can have throughout and the effects they can have on people. I wish more films would go as deep as this one did on the subject. Also, we have a memoir on one of the most prolific directors of our time, directed Steven Spielberg himself. When these two things are combined, it makes for a great picture. Even though it is 2 and a half hours long the time flew by and the story kept me engaged the entire time. Also, the performances the entire cast gives is top tier. Michelle Williams though is the real standout. She could easily win the Oscar for Best Actress. Even though it's Spielberg's story, she is basically the second main character. As an avid watcher and lover of film, this is by far my favorite of the year. Spielberg put so much of himself into making this and it really shows. It's his most personal film yet and is a true masterpiece. If you love films, you owe it to yourself to see this one.",

Rather directly, he went on semi-autobiography direction whereas he can transfer his own story into representative characters, even if they're mostly still identifiable through his perspective. Triumphant once again, we're given the film-loving roots plus the straining difficulties stemming from personal, discouraging affairs, and the genuine nostalgia of our own growth with thorough touches refusing to leave any unresolved notes. We're introduced to his inspirations and managed to pick out subtle references to his previously acclaimed classics, as part of his cinematic venture's thoroughness whilst revisiting his past and curve it as a narrative.\n\nPraiseworthy for all it can be, it seems Spielberg's main aim was towards the performative showcases perfectly embodying the self and spiritual identification only he can see happily like opening a time capsule to his past that led him onto an amazing path. Remarkably cast and brilliantly performed, particularly few at their best, as they're the true center in this honest, exceptionally scripted intimate portrait under the maintained trademarked magic dimmed down to a more personal level. If we were to determine where this film would rank in defining its release year's best of the best, it to show the formation of a cinephile's originated love that helps nurtured the cinema whilst reliving those nostalgic beginnings of mostly cherished times then deciding to project those memories personally and faithfully dramatized for a full circle momentum.

            "content": "One of Steven Spielberg's outstanding characteristics besides being a pioneer and a master director, especially in his works of old is his versatility. He has dipped his feet in almost all kinds of genres and has succeeded in his own right \u2013 science fiction to top them all, adapted screenplays, original war-time stories, adventures, et al appealing to an audience of all ages. It wasn't going to be too long until we would have seen him creating something based on his own formative days.\n\"The Fabelmans\" is pretty much his story shadow-played through a fictional family. One would have expected this sooner from him, but apprehension of the possibility that such a personal creation could hurt his parents held him back, even though his sister Anne had written something for him to direct almost a couple of decades back. His mother and father passed away in 2017 and 2020 respectively.\nThe film starts with the little boy Sammy's first brush with cinema, and his awe and anxiety towards the scary images on the silver screen, way back in 1952. One can possibly relate to Sammy's curiosity and attraction towards the fantasy of replicating a train crash he had seen in the film, using a model train. And then filming it using his father's camera, and his mom's sheltered encouragement. \nSammy is immediately taken up by that magic of capturing moving images, his control over creating something fantastic, adventurous, and pursues it with passion.\nThere is the trademark Spielberg aura of a young family's dynamics \u2013 sunny disposition, chaos, happiness, joy and squabbles as Sammy's family grows and his parents Mitzi (Michelle Adams) and Burt (Paul Dano) are now parents of two more girls, younger to Sammy. The touch of typical American-Jewish family culture is natural and I think quite intriguing for those alien to it. I loved the playful moments watching the toddlers have their way.\nAs Sammy grows up into his teens (played by Gabriel LaBelle), persistently pursuing his passion by making home-made movies with his friends pitching in as actors, he discovers that all may not be as uncomplicated as it looks in his family.\nThe overall play and flow of the story is nothing outstanding \u2013 it almost feels like a typical youth's story growing up with his family in the \u201850s and \u201860s, though Sammy's attraction to making movies right from his toddler-hood is embedded with a personal touch and dedication by Spielberg. His candidness at telling some hard truths of his story is also commendable.\nThe main supporting cast of Paul Dano, Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen are good in their places, giving LaBelle the spotlight as much as possible. Michelle Williams is quite intense and shines through a great many emotions and moods, especially with her eyes. Judd Hirsh is almost miss-able with a cameo-like appearance, but his act is a reminder to me that it doesn't matter how long your presence on the screen is; if you have a crackerjack burst of histrionics and a good monologue (remember Jack Nicholson's explosion in \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) or Anne Hathaway in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (2012)), there is a good chance you will be recognized.\nI was really taken by Julia Butters' cameo as Reggie, Sammy's younger sister at a key moment in Sammy's life. It's not much but it is a small gem. One might remember her (I definitely do!) as the little girl who bantered with and gave some life lessons to Leonardo DiCaprio's brooding character in \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" (2019) like a wise old soul. Someone to watch out for.\nIt's a great ode by Spielberg to his story and his ever-growing passion for film-making and pioneering innovations that paved way for the directors who would weave visual magic on the screen.",

His father treats this as a hobby and his mother encourages his love of creating art. During this time, we follow the family through different dynamics, social issues, and following your dreams. \n\nAs a lifelong fan of movies, I have to say I loved this movie. It was amazing to watch someone begin their filmmaking journey and see it evolve over time. Especially knowing that this is loosely based on Steven Spielberg's life and he is one of my favorite filmmakers. \n\nAlso, I enjoyed watching the family dynamics. They showed real highs and lows within a family and the generational differences on what they believe is a viable career (seems like something that will never end). \n\nMy only criticism of the movie was that it was a little bit on the long side. There were just a few scenes that I didn't feel were completely necessary to the story. \n\nIf you have the opportunity to watch this movie, I say take the time to sit down, snuggle up, and enjoy. It is a great reminder to follow your dreams, work hard, and do whatever it takes to make them come true. I always appreciate the reminder that we only have one life so it's our job to make it the best we can. The best looks different for each of us, but it's our responsibility to shoot for the things that will make us feel fulfilled. Nobody else is going to make it happen for you, so snag every opportunity.",

Mr. Fabelman is a scientist who tells himself that he loves his work, wife and family and that Benny is his best friend. Mrs. Fabelman tells herself that she is the creative one who loves her family and that her secrets are her own business. But, as the young protagonist Sam Fabelman learns, these fables are not really true. He learns his mother really loves Benny and not his father - and his mother confirms this when confronted - and that his father may not actually be his father.\n\nSteven Spielberg's origin story bears a strong resemblance to two films that came out in the early 1980's - ET (his acknowledged favourite) and Fanny and Alexander By Ingmar Bergman. Both are family sagas about divorce, youthful passions and strange events with a tinge of magic. It is a story of his passion for film and his genius for making films, which started very early and as of this film, hasn't yet stopped. Film as autobiography has never been so blatant or accomplished than this, nor as kind and perceptive. Paul Dano is Burt (his dad), a brilliant, bumbling, slightly cold man who has been cuckholded by Michelle Williams (his flamboyant and slightly crazy mother) with his best friend Benny ( Scott Rudin).  Gabriel La Belle (Sam) learns about film making and life, with all its ups and downs, in this unique, confessional film. It is brilliantly scripted by Spielberg  and Tony Kushner, shot with great care by the director  and the cast is impeccable. That this film was ignored by the Oscars is a terrible insult to Spielberg  and the cast, and to film making itself. It is never gimmicky, always emotionally acute and paced with great skill.\n\nIt was even better than All Quiet on the Western Front, my previous best of 2022. A classic.",

It's also beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and includes a cameo from director John Ford as played by David Lynch, giving a succinct introduction to keeping your films interesting. As a summation of everything Steven Spielberg has learned up till now, and as one of his most personal, most autobiographical films, it is very entertaining and watchable, packed with cute digressions, humour, and a humanistic story. It also suffers from Spielberg's typical weaknesses. I guess that makes it a great auteurist film.",

But then, so does the Rocky, Star Wars, and Fast & Furious franchises. Success and acclaim doesn't guarantee quality, as the annual winners of Grammy, Emmy and, yes, Oscars proves.\nWell, this is Speilberg's tribute to himself and all his noble aspirations and mawkish, childlike wonder. It's a step up from a relative bringing out family videos, but at least those have an honesty about them.\nManipulative and self-aggrandizing, he apparently thought his enthusiasm would transmit to the audience. It doesn't.\nGood luck at the Oscars, Steve.",

            "content": "every picturemaker has an origin story; they all have a moment of realization when they knew the true magic of what cinema can do and Steven Spielberg has to have the biggest flex in telling his own story of filmmaking through film itself.\n\nsammy is taken by his parents Mitzi and Burt Fabelman on his first trip to the movie theater to watch Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth. a nervous sammy watches in horror with mouth-agape fascination, as a pair of circus trains collide. to us, as 2022 audiences, the crash effects are crude and the scene is pretty lackluster, but to sammy in 1952, it truly is, The Greatest Show on Earth.\n\non the ride home, sammy's parents are debating if the movie was too scary for him but sammy says nothing, still wondering what he saw and that night, he goes to bed dreaming of trains. we then see sammy screaming for his mom at the top of his lungs and we instantly assume The Greatest Show on Earth has given him the Greatest Nightmare on Earth. alas, that isn't the case. sammy is jauntily jumping in bed and he knows exactly what he wants for Hanukkah: A Train Set. he then recreates the crash scene from The Greatest Show on Earth with his train over and over until his mother gives him the family's 8mm camera to shoot his own version of the sequence. she thinks that the camera will get the crashing trains out of his mind, or at least encourage him to stop smashing the very expensive toy around. although it does happen, it's not quite what you'd expect; instead, sammy has now transferred his interest from the train to the camera and once he did, he never let it go as evident from the film and his director itself.\n\nwhat's most intriguing about this film is that you can tell, that even after 70 years, the real Steven Spielberg remains equally obsessed with movies. he's obviously learned a lot about how to make them since 1952; but he has never lost sight of the why.\n\nthe performances in this film are just heartbreaking and beautiful. paul dano has never had a bad performance in his entire career and his streak remains intact. and what's even more impressive, he has given us the role of a psychopath on a murderous spree and that of a loving, heartbroken father wanting what's best for his boy both in the same year. truly one of the best actors of our time. michelle williams OMG. what an absolute icon. this might be her most nuanced, emotionally-wrecking role to date and that shows. she was obviously the best part of the film for me because although the film never antagonizes paul dano's character (because he truly is the nicest person to exist who thinks rationally and is confined to reality), you know that he and michelle william's character can't stay together for long. they eventually have to seperate. the film uses this plot point like a chekhov's gun waiting to fire, a powder keg waiting to blow and steven builds up to that moment of lives being shattered with utmost delicacy. even the after-effects felt due to that are felt to the core and just brilliantly written. Gabriel LaBelle honestly is literally me. he is afraid, emotional, unsure of what to do in life if not following his true passion and even willing to sacrifice that passion for the sake of the family. truly a standout performance and I wish to see more of him in future films. rest of the performances are also really great and not a single loose thread.\n\nthe background score. 2022, a year of such great musical numbers and background scores. we have avatar 2' action packed score, babylon's trumpets, and the batman's epic and rousing theme (which I still think is the best score of the year and the academy does a real disservice to michael giacchino by not even nominating it). just when we thought we had it done and dusted, john williams rose from the ashes and gave us the beautiful score of this film. truly some exceptional work here. each and every single one of the piano pieces are beautiful and I desire to have this on vinyl.\n\nthe cinematography is also beautiful and not wanting to say much here without spoiling the absolute beauty of the shots, the 2 best scenes of the film for me are michelle williams gracefully performing in front of the car headlights in a gorgeous white gown and the last shot of the film which skillfully shifts the horizon from the middle to bottom.\n\nI'm just happy that even though I had the chance to watch this at home, I decided to wait for that theatrical experience and got the best out of it.\n\nP.S.: truly bummed and shocked to see this film's box office failure. cinema is truly dying and only we can save it guys. please go for this film in the theatres if you can because this is spielberg's most personal film to date and it deserves your attention.",

It is a nostalgic and beautiful look that also acts as an ode to the film industry and in which Spielberg shows us what shaped him into becoming one of the most beloved filmmakers of our time and how he lived through the antisemitism he had to endure in his early years.

Here, it's Steven Spielberg in the director's chair and, as in \"Belfast\" and \"Roma,\" the director's whole soul is on display for the world to see. Reverent, earnest and occasionally cheeky, this film leans further away from the traditional trappings of the Hollywood biopic, opting instead to tell a coming-of-age tale that's freer in form than I was expecting. In any event, it's undeniably fascinating to see any filmmaker mulling over the different elements of their own life and then applying artistic flair to it in turn. There's something even more surreal, however, in having that filmmaker be the literal person whose last name is most closely associated with the profession of filmmaking itself.

While The Fabelmans doesn't reach the levels of any of those films it's still a really great edition to his filmography. On the surface, The Fabelmans can seem weird. \"Why would you make an autobiography about yourself\" is what someone might ask and while \"pretentious\" might be the first thing that comes to your mind, The Fabelmans doesn't feel that way. The film honestly feels more like a Spielberg therapy session than a Spielberg biopic. It feels more like Spielberg coming to terms with who his parents were and why they mean so much to him especially his Dad and how they influenced him into making films. As with most of his films, Spielberg's directing is great and it feels much more personal than it has since probably the late 90s or early 2000s. The cinematography as well is gorgeous at points and the performances are mostly all pretty top notch. Paul Dano, Seth Rogen and Gabriel LaBelle all did a fantastic job here. Michelle Williams was good but her performance was more mixed in my opinion. Sometimes she was really good and sometimes she was just a bit much. John Williams's score was great as well. Nowhere near his best work but still some really good and nice music. I would say that the film doesn't become truly great up until the last 30 minutes. Everything else before that is good but it definitely can feel slow for good portions of the film. Once we get to the High School prom though is when the film becomes great.

Coincidentally, Spielberg, who is 76 waited until both of his parents were dead to make this movie. And when you learn the secret he carried his whole life, you can see why.\n\nThe core conflict in the fictional Fabelman family is between \"the scientists\" represented by the father and \"the artists\" represented by the mother. Sammy Fabelman, who represents young Steven Spielberg, finds himself solidly on the artist's side. But once you decide you're an artist, you spend the rest of your life learning that art is pain, at least according to Uncle Boris.\n\nOne of the greatest story arcs is the change in the way Sammy views his parents, from perfect, strong, steady forces in his life to broken people, as unsure about things as everyone else. This happens as Sammy is growing up, trying to gain certainty is his own identity and aspirations.\n\nSammy's mom encourages her son to follow his heart, no matter what - a beautiful message which is somewhat tainted because at that time for her, following her heart meant leaving her husband and breaking up her family.\n\nMichelle Williams, per us' is the best part of any movie she's in, no matter the haircut. Paul Dano is amazing as the family patriarch. Seth Rogen, still with his characteristic goofy laugh, plays a more serious role than normal, and he does it well.\n\nIt's an ode to film, and I love film, but I do think that Hollywood can easily drift into navel-gazing and a self-congratulatory posture that no one asked for at the drop of a hat. If you love film or love Spielberg, definitely see the movie, but overall I think it's too disjointed and personal to stand on its own as a great film, or even a good story.",

The Fabelmans is a film he's been intending to make for decades, and with the onset of COVID and the subsequent lockdowns, he's finally had the time to formulate it. It's been said that's it all about the love of movies and how both watching and making them can be a transformative experience. But having sat down and watched it last night, I was surprised how much this theme often went by the wayside. The film, at its core, is about the family unit, which can be both loving and volatile, sometimes in equal measure. When the filmmaking element is involved, it's not overindulged or even especially romanticised. Our lead's passion for making movies is treated as a dream, an aspiration, but it's not presented as a crutch. It's not something you can run to when you're in despair and expect it to take your problems away. Sammy Fabelman uses the power of film to explore and examine his family, not to glorify them. It presents the development of cinematic technology and trends over a relatively brief but important period of time, and even offers a few glimpses into the filmmaking process, which Spielberg himself has said came from his own experience. Being semi-autobiographical, it offers a window into the personal life of one of our most acclaimed cinematic figures; a man whose films we all known, but who we have never really connected with on a personal level. I liked all the performances, even though a few teetered on the verge of melodramatic at times. It clearly comes from a place of compassion and earnesty, and that's what resonated so strongly with people. It's runtime of 2 and a half hours gives us the time to get comfortable with it characters, but it frequently leaves you checking your watch. Also, for a biopic made by and about a famous figure, it doesn't take a lot of risks or do anything we haven't seen before. Even the confrontations and arguments feel sanitised and even glossed over. For these reasons, it's a film I enjoy and admire, but would almost certainly never revisit unless it was for a specific reason, like if I was making a video, recording a podcast or writing a document on it. I'm very happy that Spielberg got to tell this highly personal story, and as predictably whimsy as it can be at times, its still a beautiful story that any fan of cinema should check out at least once.",

It concentrates mainly on his childhood and teenage years.\n\nThere is no doubt that he is one of the greatest film makers of all time, just look at his filmography: Jaws, E.T., The Colour Purple, Jurassic Park, Amistad, Saving Private Ryan, Munich, Lincoln and several other very well made films.\n\nI just wish that this film 'The Fablemans' would have gone into more detail about how he made those films, that would have been very interesting.\n\nBut showing his beginnings in a Jewish family that moved around the United States (NJ, to AZ, to CA) shed some light on the dysfunctionality of his family, his experiences with anti-semitism and the development of his ambition towards making short films with primitive cameras.\n\nMichelle Williams and Paul Dano have strong roles. Seth Rogan (who can't act worth beans) plays the role of Williams friend and eventual love interest. \n\nJudd Hirsch has been nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his role in this film. This is a joke considering he is in the film for amount five minutes, during which he does nothing Oscar worthy. But with Steven Spielberg directing this movie about himself, I guess anything is possible.\n\nOverall: disappointing, but better than the other garbage that was nominated in 2023 like: Elvis, Everything everywhere all at once, Causeway, All quiet on the western front,  Banshees of Inisherin, Aftersun, Avatar . . . it has truly been the worst year in Academy Ward history.",

With Paul Dano and Michelle Williams as opposites-attract parents and Seth Rogen as an uncle, the movie could've been a riveting look at the legendary filmmaker's childhood. However, their performances are overwrought and the movie's excessive focus on the perils of the relationship between Sammy's parents detracts from the story. Judd Hirsch adds some much-needed life to the film and Gabriel LaBelle does his best with the role, but the John Williams score sounds recycled and the editing is too laborious for a 150-minute movie. Ultimately, there doesn't seem to be any real urgency to \"The Fabelmans\" and it's unlikely to make much of an impact on the upcoming awards circuit; the casual movie fan can wait on this one.\n\nSpanish Review\n\nA pesar de su premisa prometedora, la \u00faltima pel\u00edcula de Steven Spielberg, \"The Fabelmans\", no da en el blanco. Con Paul Dano y Michelle Williams como padres opuestos y Seth Rogen como t\u00edo, la pel\u00edcula podr\u00eda haber sido una mirada fascinante a la infancia del legendario cineasta. Sin embargo, sus actuaciones son exageradas y el enfoque excesivo de la pel\u00edcula en los peligros de la relaci\u00f3n entre los padres de Sammy resta valor a la historia. Judd Hirsch le da un poco de vida muy necesaria a la pel\u00edcula y Gabriel LaBelle hace lo mejor que puede con el papel, pero la partitura de John Williams suena reciclada y la edici\u00f3n es demasiado laboriosa para una pel\u00edcula de 150 minutos. En \u00faltima instancia, no parece haber ninguna urgencia real en \"The Fabelmans\" y es poco probable que tenga un gran impacto en el pr\u00f3ximo circuito de premios; el aficionado al cine casual puede esperar en este.",

He wants to recreate the train wreck from the movie, and it's his mom who suggests filming it on an 8mm camera... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: this is Steven Spielberg's long-awaited film of his youth. I love and respect Spielberg, but this is Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent. There isn't a single aspect of the movie that I found interesting or redeeming. Why did Spielberg assume that his family's comings and goings, including his parents' marital challenges, would be so unique and hence interesting, when in fact this is what happened to millions and millions of families in the 50s and early 60s. As a complete aside, as most of you know Spielberg lived in Cincinnati until age 11, then moved to Phoenix. A significant early part of the movie plays out in Cincinnati, but there is not a single reference, none, to Cincinnati. Why? In contrast, the second that the family is moving to Phoenix, Arizona, the area is mentioned multiple times in the film. I find it curious, to say the least.\n\n\"The Fabelmans\" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim and then was released in US theaters just before Thanksgiving. Since then it has significantly underperformed at the box office (a mere $12 million after 7 weeks). The matinee screening where I saw this at the day after New Year's at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended well (I counted roughly 30 people). I honestly cannot think of any movie by Spielberg that is worse than this, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone. If you haven't seen this yet, please save yourself the time and money. You'll thank me later when you catch it streaming at some point.",

            "content": "Inspired by childhood events and his parents' divorce when he was a teenager, Steven Spielberg's 2023 Oscar contender, co-written with playwright Tony Kushner, is an intensely personal and introspective film, which is immensely easy to like and enjoy, mashing up multiple genres that include an aspiring film-maker's coming of age story, a divorce family drama and a high school rom-com. Gabriel LaBelle, in a grounded and winsome performance, plays Sammy Fabelman, Spielberg's substitute, while Michelle Williams has the showier part of his free-spirited mother, and Paul Dano takes the subtler and often overlooked role of his down-to-earth and more practical father. As Dad's career goes from strength to strength, resulting in his family's migration across the country, Mom's unhappiness with her marriage bubbles up to become something that's no longer containable. Structured as a movie of 2 halves, the sudden pivot mid-film from family to high school anti-Semitic bully drama can cause whiplash but there's a satisfying payoff when it's all threaded through to demonstrate the power of films and its importance in Sammy/Spielberg's life, which is appealing for me on a Cinema Paradiso level. Bar the final epilogue scene (which will delight Spielberg enthusiasts), the story here has universal appeal and application to any young person who has lived through a parents' divorce, but more cynical viewers understandably can find this a schmaltzy exercise in sentimentality. Thankfully the film handles it all with sophistication and masterly control, as the treatment of Sammy's discovery of a family secret and the subsequent confrontation with his mother demonstrate; and Spielberg's effortlessly dexterous and calibrated execution, with quaintly stylish visual compositions and fluid editing, blending in Sammy's film footage for additional authenticity and warmth, is how he gets away with it and why there's a difference between saccharine and Spielbergian.",

It is fascinating to see the beginnings of the man who brought films such as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Indiana Jones\" to life. Though it took a minute for me to become invested in the characters, once the pacing hit its stride, I was hooked. \n\nThe film tackles difficult topics, such as racism and infidelity, without forcing an agenda. There is a truth to \"The Fabelmans\" that was uniquely charming. Spielberg is not afraid of silence, and some of the most memorable scenes are from those quiet moments. Rather than relying on words, facial expressions perfectly conveyed the message he wanted to tell. \n\nWhen the film started, I was concerned about the acting and the script. Some of the performances were stiff and felt pretentious, at least at first. It was evident that the pressure of portraying Spielberg's family was daunting for some of the actors. After about 20 minutes, the acting seemed more natural, and I was able to see the passion behind each performance.   \n\nAs the film is based on Steven Spielberg's childhood/youth, there were a lot of small stories over the 2 hour 30-minute runtime. At times, these individual scenes felt disconnected from the ultimate narrative. Similarly, some of the editing was choppy and out of place. Ultimately, the story came together, but there were some unnecessary stops along the way.\n\nIf you love films, you will find joy in \"The Fabelmans\". After finishing the movie, I felt inspired in a unique way. It is evident that Steven Spielberg put his heart into this project and that he tapped into deep, personal roots. As the Academy Awards approach, this film is a lock to win one, if not more of their seven nominations.\n\nBest Character: Sammy\nBest Scene: Late Night Passion Projects\nBest Quote: \"Movies are dreams that you never forget.\" \u2013 Mitzi Fabelman\nBest Piece of Score: \"Mother and Son\"",

            "content": "For a director who has always prioritised entertainment over aesthetics and audience over auteur, The Fabelmans is an oddly discomfiting watch at times, even for a movie that seems to be trying to hit some emotional truths while maintaining the youthful protagonist's wide-eyed view of his chosen profession, movie-making. In a way, it's an homage primarily to the young Sam Fabelman's mother, and a nod to the maternal sacrifice required of her in choosing family over art, motherhood over music. This theme is repeated throughout the film, in scenes with his uncle - also with a toe in the movie business - where he tells Sammy that he'll be ripped apart by the choice between art and domestic life just as his mother, played by Michelle Williams, is.\nThere's an oddly unsettling quality to some of the 'happy family' scenes throughout, although the characters of Sammy's sisters are funny, natural, and just a tad anarchic themselves. In the end however, this emotional queasiness rises to the top, as Mimi's eccentricities tread a fine line between endearing artiness and pathological narcissism. The same tone is struck in ET as Elliott's mother strides distractedly around her chaotic post-divorce house, into which an actual extra-terrestrial has moved without her noticing, a fact that Spielberg plays on as she repeatedly crosses ET's path, highly strung and oblivious.\nIn The Fabelmans, however, Spielberg is reaching for something even closer to home - his own actual formation as a filmmaker. And like his protagonist Sam, he doesn't lack courage, drive, or even - as his sister points out - the necessary strange detachment. Neither do the depictions of his parents lack compassion or nuance. Not at all. But this doesn't make it an uncomplicated watch. It's as if, like Sam filming the anti-Semitic bullies in his school, he can't resist glorifying them and ingratiating himself at the same time. It's like a superpower, this creativity: in positioning the aesthetic superiority of the athletic blonde bully, he protects himself from the more dangerous aspects of his own 'underdog' status.\nThe Fabelmans are foregrounded as a Jewish family from the narrative get-go, and the movie certainly doesn't shy away from this fact. There are even bigger themes at play here though - life vs art; sacrifice vs responsibility; parenting vs freedom. For Jewish protagonist Sam Fabelman, the movies are a way of, as Mimi Fabelman suggests, 'controlling his anxiety' and, at the same time, winning over his detractors. It's a dangerous game though, as even the bully realises. Sam's portrayal of him as 'golden boy' is no less of a trap than Sam's role of underdog.\nIn the end however, it's the artistic conversation that matters most, as 'representer' and 'represented' grapple with their respective roles and come to an uneasy truce. \nThe youthful Sam defends his high school movie by saying 'the camera sees what it sees.' But an old veteran like his mentor John Ford (keep an eye out here - pun intended - for David Lynch) knows better -  it's the ANGLE that tells the story...",

Superb visual storytelling and of course meta layering \u2014 using cinematography to capture the magic of filmmaking itself: shots of faces watching and experiencing films-within-the-film, luxurious details of and close ups on 50s and 60s film tech, etc. Michele Williams is a revelation in this. Dialogue sometimes a big clunky/stagey (you can hear Tony Kushner at a typewriter in some of the later scenes dialogue)  and the last third drags just a tiny bit.

Michelle Williams ALSO had an excellent performance and she most certainly belongs in the Oscar race.

            "content": "THE FABELMANS, a semi-autobiographical account of the film's director, Steven Spielberg's childhood years, co-written by Spielberg and Tony Kushner, stars Gabriel LaBelle as the young, budding filmmaker Sammy Fabelman. Sammy's hesitant, yet supportive parents, Mitzi and Burt Fabelman are played by the luminous Michelle Williams and the convincing Paul Dano. Also in the film, Judd Hirsch making a short but memorable appearance in his recent Best Supporting Actor Oscar-nominated performance as Sammy's cantankerous Uncle Boris. Spielberg pays homage to the wonders and realities of youth, dreams and love of cinema seen through the eyes of Sammy whose early life witnesses his mother's unrealized musical aspirations, his father's multiple job changes resulting in the Fabelmans various moves from state-to-state, and the ultimate breakup of his family following his parents divorce. All this going on while Sammy realizes and begins to nurture his own artistic talents for filmmaking. A highlight of the movie is an almost unrecognizable David Lynch who appears at the climax of the film as Iconic director John Ford who talks to Sammy about the importance of horizon in good filmmaking. Steven Spielberg is one of the great directors who is blessed with a true gift for storytelling and he accomplishes this, again with THE FABELMANS. You may recognize his abiding love for Indiana Jones in this film through the character of a handsome, tough on the outside, flawed on the inside high school track star, caught on camera on Ditch Day by 18 year old Sammy Fabelman. It's obvious Steven Spielberg never forgot him.",

Produced after the death of his mother Leah Adler and using the fictional family name of the Fabelmans the movie focuses primarily on the iconic film makers family and the impact his parents divorce had on his young life. \u00a0\"The Fabelmans\" is rich in \u00a0exposing the influences behind classic movies like E.T. ( Set in a broken home ) and some early techniques at effects the film maker used to better his home movies.\u00a0\n\n\"The Fabelmans\" starts in the 1950's with Sammy Fabelman experiencing for the first time the magic of cinema with his parents. Slightly traumatised by the movie, particularly a train crash scene it's from this emotional experience the first glimpses of becoming a film maker appear. Who of us that have delved into the arts ( film making, actors , singers , performers , etc ) didn't start off creating these types of home made replicas? \u00a0The idyllic family set up, with the ever growing confident and more adept young home movie maker, \u00a0becomes derailed when after editing his 8mm footage of a family camping trip he discovers all was not as he remembered. \u00a0The impact of what Sam discovers about his concert pianist mother and that fateful trip results in the eventual breakdown of his parents.\u00a0\n\nAs the movie moves into the early 1960's and Spielberg's high school years \"The Fabelmans\"touches on religion, race issues and first love. Due to the impact of that fateful camping holiday and therefore following a hiatus of not wanting to make any further home movies, Sam is persuaded by his girlfriend to film the end of school year beach party get together. \u00a0The impact of Sam's return to film making is clearly visible after the graduation film he produced is shown at the school prom to great acclaim. \u00a0\n\n\"The Fabelmans\" is well documented as being a love letter to cinema but equally it is Spielberg's love letter to his family. This is the movies key fact, the acceptance of multiple things happening all at once. Vocation is driven by both fear and talent, loving relationships break down, and movies that appear simplistic are highly sophisticated. With an extremely satisfying ending \" The Fabelmans\" is a beautifully crafted work of art and remarkable insight into one of the most famous and influential directors Hollywood has ever produced",

Anyone that has watched the Wonder Years Will be immediately familiar with format\u2014the nostalgia, the examination of a family through the experience of one main character. But when that cutesy-ness lingers in the final third it morphs into out-and-out daytime TV melodrama. This film has a lot going for it but ultimately fails to close out its great ground work at the business end. All good coming of age films are relatable and complex, the best are profound and offer artistic insight in to our lives though the director's lens. Unfortunately the Fablemens fails to make the final leap despite the inclusion all the necessary complexities that should enable such a conclusion. It has complicated sexual relations, family relations, personal passions and an array of inequality and injustice that life provides\u2014all inspired no doubt by the Wonder Years and Spielberg's own life. As expected, this is complemented with a lusciously beautiful presentation of 50s and 60s nostalgia. And mainly for these reasons it is an engaging and highly enjoyable film only let down by a garbled and somewhat rushed final step. Instead of showing a exploration and blossoming of the main character after multiple setbacks, failures and family shake ups, the Fablemens relies on an cameo (a very good one) from David Lynch to end on a suspenseful albeit smug final scene (smug because of the semi autobiographical nature of the film). Much like the rest of the film, the elements required are present in the final third but they are presented austerely and without the consideration and depth of emotion required to deliver the bit when the main character actually comes of age\u2026 I left the theatre with a strong suspicion that this was meant to be two films, or perhaps even a TV show. With better prep and an editor on the side of the viewer rather than, well, Spielberg, we might have got what we expected. Wilhelm scream count - 0.",

He is great with action, editing, lighting, etc., but generally misses the mark with dialogue scenes.\nTHE FABLEMANS is, to be honest and blunt, absolutely terrible.\nIt is supposed to be a fictional account of his foray into film-making at an early age, but comes across as a series of scenes which do not connect. There is no rhythm to the movie, and no actual storyline.\nTruth: I left after the first hour. Walked out and away from this mess!\nThe cast, somehow up for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble, is awkward. Paul Dano, as the fictional boy's father, is miscast, seems to be trying too hard to be fatherly, and came across dazed.\nMichelle Williams flounders. She never finds her center. Then again, she's given bizarre things to do like show us half-eaten food in her mouth and dance around in the woods.\nJudd Hirsch hams it up, and eats the scenery, but not in a good way. He continues the stereotype of what a \"Jew\" is supposed to be. \nSeth Rogen gives the best performance in the hour I actually watched.\nThe scenes sit flat. No movement. The dialogue is dull. Who cares about Dad going on and on about IBM?\nSpielberg has, frankly, lost his magic touch.\nThis is a movie that, somehow, won The Golden Globe for Best Picture.\nThen again, NBC owns Universal Pictures.\nNBC aired The Globes.\nSo...\nTHE FABLEMANS has no connection to its audience.\nGrade: F\n#Oscars #movies",

This film has a runtime of 2hrs 31 mins and I can honestly say that every second of that flew right by. I was engaged and hooked into the story right from the very first scene. \n\nUltimately this is a movie about people who are suffering. One is suffering for his family to love him, one is suffering for love, and one is suffering for his art.\n\nIt was interesting to see the instant connection that Spielberg had with movies. He was hooked as soon as he saw the train crash in \"The Greatest Show On Earth.\" So much so, that he tried to recreate it and the rest is history as they say. \n\nThe acting in this film was just phenomenal. You could really feel the internal struggle which plagued Paul Dano throughout the film. He knew his faults as a husband and father, but did  nothing to be better. He just kept on being a workaholic and this ultimately caused the downfall of the family.\n\nGabriel LaBelle Really shined as the main character. He slowly gains his footing into film making and uses it as an escape from his reality, but also as a means to show the truth. He persevered and eventually got what he wanted, a chance to break into the industry. He never had support from his father, he suffered for his art. We can ultimately see how Spielberg developed his style. \n\nMichelle Williams is the standout star in this one. She really portrayed her character well. Her pain at not being with the right person really felt real. She didn't even need to speak all her mannerisms and facial expressions did the work for her. She is a selfish as they come (even admits it) and I personally didn't like this. Why break up your family like that? Life will not always be exciting. You have a loving husband and wonderful kids and you threw it away to be with his friend. Shame on her.  \n\nIt  goes to show that you don't need to have any special effects or exploding cars to make a good movie. A great story will always triumph, and this movie certainly has. \n\nIt's a must watch. \n\nThis gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 10/10",

His relationship with his parents (and to a certain degree with his sisters and his great-uncle) are central and inform what makes his movies so utterly heart-felt.

I don't know how much in this are true, this proves he has got a great family always motivates him emotionally and financially. I like the early part until leaving in Phoenix, and find that maybe high school time was his dull and darkest period (that is not that terrible in real) and the contrasting direction makes you feel so. Again his use of child/youth actor is masterful in this, too. You won't feel this has a long running time. One thing I just laughed that his affection towards crash started so early if its true.",

Young Gabriel LaBelle is an actor of note as he carries loads of his life - parents, siblings, \"uncle\", classmates, but most notably, his art.  It's not heavy drama; certainly not a blow 'em up, shoot 'em up action movie. It's about a close loving Jewish family with a penchant for art and film making. Conflict comes from within the family and classmates at school.  The family is worthy of 2+ calming hours in a theater.",

A semi autobiography paying tribute to his love for films from when he was only a young boy, while also diving deep into his humble up bringing. The film almost feels like a bunch of old home family videos collected over the years, documenting the Fabelmans story through the eyes of a young aspiring film maker, Sam Fabelman. We get a close look at how Sam Fablemans love for film making, eventually helps him uncover a dark family secret. One which will shape his family's entire future. The film focuses heavily around the joys and problems that families face, and there are elements throughout the film that we as an audience, can all definitely relate to one way or another to our own lives. It's so emotional, deep on so many levels. And what it means to follow one's heart, and the risks we take in order to live out our dreams.\n\nWhile the film won't ever hit the heights of Spielberg's signature films, it really is a love letter to his passion of film making, a film that only a legendary director of his calibre, has earnt the right to make. Michelle Williams performance is absolutely phenomenal, she absolutely nailed it! She deserves a  nomination for best actress in a leading role at the Oscars, at the very least. While she was the stand out performance, every single actor in the film is magnificent. \nAll in all, I walked out of the cinema extremely impressed, Speilberg has delivered a beautiful film, one which gives us a close look at what helped shape and inspire, one the greatest minds in the history of film making. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

            "content": "The Fabelmans is an affectionate and emotionally resonant ode to the life of a family and the power of film. It has some small faults but overall it's a masterful film from a master of cinema. Director Steven Spielberg made a film based on his life and after reading his life story it's remarkably close to the truth. The film is basically divided into three parts. In 1952 New Jersey young Sammy Fabelman is taken to the movies for the first time and is awestruck. Sammy lives with his parents and two younger sisters. His father Burt is a computer engineer and lends Sammy his movie camera, where Sammy makes home movies. When Sammy is a teenager the family move to Arizona after Burt takes a job with GE. Sammy continues his love of film making small films with his friends. This part of the film really shows how one person can fall in love with the magic of cinema. The third part of the film I think is the most successful. The family moves to California, but the parents grow apart and Sammy gets bullied at high school. We see here strong emotional scenes that are handled with truth and honesty. This is a broadly entertaining film that even though at times early on veers into sentimentality it's easy to see how personal this was for Spielberg. It's an honesty portrayal of his parents and clearly shows how movies captivated him from a young age. The film is tender, funny and deeply human. It's filled with great performances but I especially loved Paul Dano and Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy. Spielberg is a true master and this fine film stacks up with his best.",

This is such a wonderful film and the only reason I'm not giving it a perfect score is because of the runtime. Unlike Avatar, I don't think the 2 and half hour runtime of this movie was necessary. I think a good 20-30 minutes could have been shaved off and it would have had the same effect. Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are fantastic as the parents of this family. Williams really sells the idea of being a woman conflicted by her marriage. And Dano really shows off the range that he has, from the Riddler to start the year to this Father trying to keep his family together to end it. Seth Rogan delivers a fantastic dramatic performance, so much so that his trademark laugh feels so out of place here. Gabriel LaBelle is just fantastic in this. Not many people can keep you invested in a 2 and half hour long movie but he did here. I was invested in his story and now I'm invested in his career and where it goes from here. I've loved Julia Butters since her time on American Housewife but I haven't seen her since she exited the show and was replaced, but I'm so happy to see her here. It took me a second because she's so much taller now but she's great here and I'm happy to see she's still acting. Jeannie Berlin and Judd Hirsch have great small roles that really flesh out this family and make it more relatable and dynamic. David Lynch makes a really fun cameo at the end that I imagine was super fun to film. The Fabelmans is such a powerful movie about family and the wonder of seeing your first movie. They do such a good job showing us why a kid would be in love with movies and how they're made. Stephen Spielberg is such a genius filmmaker and you can tell the craftsmanship of this movie has been upped on every level. This is clearly a passion project for him and I'm so happy it's as good as everyone said. I just think some of the scenes could have been tighter so the runtime could have been a lot shorter. But the acting, story, and score are all so well done. I would definitely recommend heading out to see The Fabelmans, if your AMC is even playing it. 9/10. -Tyler",

            "content": "Before I launch into this review, here's a bit of background.  I was a teenage filmmaker, like the protagonist, who filmed my own productions with families and friends that I would then screen in church basements or high school auditoriums.  I was predisposed to LOVE this film, and indeed, at times, scenes felt like they were lifted straight out of my youth.\nAlas, that was only about 20% of the time in this dull, over-wrought, over-long, poorly written snore fest that barely rises above the worst made-for-tv failing-family storytelling.  Part way through, I sensed that Spielberg himself must have been the chief writer.  I consider him something of a flawed genius.  When he turns his talents to suspense and action, he has no equal.  When he gives himself over to sentimentality, he's one of the worst.  To understand this better, think of two scenes from Jurassic Park...The terrifying T-rex night attack, and the sappy brachiosaur scene that feels lifted straight off of Saturday morning kids t.v.  How does the same filmmaker produce two such disparate scenes in one movie?  Fabelmans is 10 minutes of t-rex followed by 50 of brachiosaur.  \nI sometimes wonder if Spielberg has an astute grasp on how human emotions work, since so many scenes feature odd and strange behaviours from the characters.  The arrogant jock gets weepy at a high school film screening that makes him look like an action hero.  Perhaps he's motivated by his guilt at how poorly he's treated the film-maker.  But I've known guys like this...and in that moment, at that point in his life, he'd be nothing but pumped up.  The realization that he may have treated others badly is something that would come much later in his life, if ever.  Ditto the strange emotions of the protagonist during his screenings, when he could barely look at the audience or the screen.  If film-making is your escape from everyday life, you'd be hyper-focused on your audience reactions and likely, on cloud 9, especially when you're getting a good reception.  My own screening experiences were very much like the film's lead, and they were unfailingly a thrill and a high for me.  Escapism at its very best, not a moment to be all introspective and weepy.  \nClunky, expository scenes and dialogue are rife.  There's a cameo by Judd Hirsch that is \"deus ex machina\" at its worst.  He literally drops into the movie to explain what the overarching theme is, and then is whisked away minutes later.  \nI think my biggest beef with the film lies in the marketing.  The trailers and commercials make you think you're going to watch the story of a brilliant wunderkind using his wits and talents to reach the pinnacle of his art.  There's times when that's exactly what this is.  But it's never long before that's derailed and we are off to some other less interesting place for long long periods of time (I checked my watch more and more as it wore on). Hell, the kid even abandons his craft for a good chunk of the third act. The net result is about a half hour of an interesting movie buried in a tedious two and a half.  And my two movie-going partners concurred with all of the above.",

Based loosely on Steven Spielberg's adolescence, it follows the story of Sammy Fabelman, an aspiring young filmmaker who discovers a family secret and is forced to confront difficult truths about his past.\n\nThe film features excellent performances from its cast, particularly from its young lead, Gabriel LaBelle, who brings a nuanced vulnerability to the role, and Michelle Williams who is brilliant as Sammy's confused mother.\n\nThe cinematography is stunning, bringing an ethereal beauty to its scenes that transport viewers into another time. The movie also features captivating music from the era, tying in with the film's overall theme of nostalgia and remembrance. The intricate set design and cinematography also help to paint an effective picture of life in 1950s Arizona.\n\nThe Fabelmans is far from perfect due to its almost too-glossy look and the feeling that it doesn't dig deep enough, but it succeeds due to its strong performances and smart storytelling. It's a film that offers an inspiring glimpse into the power of film and its ability to help people confront difficult truths. Overall, I found it enjoyable and thought-provoking, and it left me feeling a little wiser for the experience.",

This is a masterful, paradoxical story crafted by one of cinemas most impactful directors about his upbringing as a novice filmmaker in a time when filmmaking, as we know it today, was in its infancy.\n\nSpielberg tells his memoir through Sammy Fabelman, and he could have only dreamt about back in the 60s and 70s of capturing his younger years with this level of expertise and technological innovation. The film is not only a lesson about the history of film but an intricate exploration of film techniques and family dynamics.\n\nThere are many revelations and gutsy, tough themes in \"The Fabelmans\", but none speaks more strongly than that of the capabilities and evolution of film - that cameras often capture and preserve moments that can't be captured, or often go unnoticed, in real life.\n\nThis is proof that film is magic, a precious time capsule where Spielberg pays homage to the movies. Yet not everything is glossy, as we also get an intimate look at the challenges that come with marriage, parenthood, coming of age, bullying, and antisemitism. Yes, some scenes are emotionally charged, even painful, but others are beautiful and funny, and Spielberg's trademark moments of innocence, wonder, and awe shine through.\n\nTop this masterwork with some great performances, especially by Gabriel LaBelle as Sammy and Michelle Williams as his mom, Mitzi, and you have one of the best films of 2022.",

I was fascinated to watch the impact of the art of  cinema on the gifted boy, and how his gift of art grew along with him as he matured. I grew up knowing a gifted ballerina my age, and watching an artist mature from child to adult is like watching God in action. Additionally, watching the family's move from east coast to west coast in the 1960s is also fascinating. All the scenes showing the children during that time period are good and really important, because the differences between the 2 coasts at that time were tremendous. My family and myself experienced the same emotions. The west coast's lack of tolerance, anti-semitism, the beach scene, are all examples of culture change that my siblings and I experienced. The parents were not aware of their children's struggles, probably because they were having their own struggles with the changes in roles and the norms in marriage during the 60s. The movie was very entertaining, everyone over 55 should identify with it. And for those under 55, watching this movie will  educate you about the American culture of the 1960s. That decade was very challenging to grow up in. Super movie for these 2 reasons and much more.",

That'll be how we end the movie.\"\n\"Sounds good, Steven.\"\n\nI don't think The Fabelmans is the masterpiece that others seem to believe it is. It's a very nice movie, but every film about filmmaking really needs to pull its weight and differentiate itself these days, because come Oscar season we seem to get a small handful of films about \"the craft\" that may or may not be pandering to members of the Academy, patting each other on the back over their choice of career. It's clear that there was passion and sincerity as Spielberg describes the totally-not-child-version-of-himself growing up and seeing the power of the camera, how it gave him a different perspective and a creative outlet. The stitches binding together Sammy's love of film and the observations he makes on his family's life make the two inseparable, but they don't necessarily add much in the way of insight to one another; this very lengthy film has some shockingly standard story beats - parents drifting apart, a couple of school bullies, a sense of professional aimlessness - that are all cinema ex machina'd by the restorative waters of a handheld camera. Film isn't treated so much as a salve, a placebo, or an escape in The Fablemans as much as it is a miraculous cure-all, and maybe it's that lack of realism (or cynicism?) that makes the wonder feel too sickly-sweet. Very likable, particularly the creativity that Sammy exhibits with his early filmmaking, but it seems odd for Spielberg, the creator of the blockbuster, to act as if the commercial side of cinema doesn't exist and it's easier to create this more easily digestible wonderland version. Or maybe I'm just cranky. \n\nWatching this so soon after I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's BARDO is an interesting experience; both are meditative pseudo-autobiographies on the role of film and filmmaker with heavy emphasis on family, but where I\u00f1\u00e1rritu chose to address cultural issues and experiment, Spielberg stayed relatively grounded and sentimental. Not a problem with either, more an observation. \n\nSo is Seth Rogen a legitimate actor now? I mean, we're not that far removed from Sausage Party. (3.5/5)",

But, perhaps that was the goal.  Unfortunately, it left theatre-goers getting up to get popcorn or visit the restroom because you wouldn't miss anything by leaving the theatre.   More editing of extremely long, unnecessary scenes, less time pouring over his childhood and more examples of him learning his craft, his professional experiences and rise to being an exceptional director (early work) would have been much more interesting and enlightening for the audience.

The characters were not relatable, and the story was boring and did not inspire empathy.\n\nWhen watching some of the scenes, I didn't know what emotion to feel: sadness, anger, sorrow, frustration, or something else? The script was awful; I didn't know what some of the lines meant or even the sentiment they were intended to convey.\n\nThere are still parts that I don't understand. There were so many loose ends and lingering questions, even at the end of the movie. I understand that, in real life, there might be remaining uncertainties; but why did he decide to give everyone fake names if he wasn't going to slightly alter the events/details for the better of the movie? \n\nI suppose Michelle Williams played a complex character interestingly, but Paul Dano seemed kinda creepy, which I don't think was the intention.

While it very much does that, I was more surprised to see what a great coming-of-age movie this is. It's about a family on the rocks and I could feel how personal this was for Spielberg. His direction is heartfelt and every scene kept me engaged. I thought the performances were all fantastic and there really isn't a weak link anywhere. I felt the movie also spoke to things I am personally interested in like Spielberg's life as well as his love for the movies and how it developed. I felt the ending of the film was a bit abrupt and think the movie could have shown even more story and been over three hours if it wanted to, and I would have been completely fine with that, which I don't say often. Overall, this is a movie that delivers that warm and sweet feeling I can safely expect with any Steven Spielberg project, and while it might not be the best movie he has ever made, it is still a fantastic one that is most definitely his most intimate and personal.",

            "content": "The Fabelmans is a semi-autobiographical based on Steven Spielberg. Funny enough it is also directed by Steven Spielberg. I haven't ever seen a biopic story that is also directed by the person the story is about. That interested me a lot but knowing it was about the legendary director Steven Spielberg is what made me want to watch it. Is the movie an overly self-indulgent semi-biopic, or does Steven continue to show why he is such a great director?\n\nThe film is such an interesting piece as the characters themselves are fictional but based on real people. For example, the character that is meant to represent Spielberg is named Samuel \"Sammy\" Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle). What I appreciate is that Steven doesn't shy away from the flaws of the character representing him. Sammy is very passionate about filmmaking but he loves it so much that he puts it above his own family. His conflict is trying to pursue his passion while his family is tearing apart. On that note, there is a complex family dynamic with the clash of the logical but stern yet loving Dad (Paul Dano) and the artistic but selfish yet encouraging Mother (Michelle Williams). Sammy inherits both qualities from his parents but also some of their worse. Seeing the struggle of chasing a dream and their isolation is such an engaging theme. None of the characters is terrible people. They do wrong things but there is a lot more nuance to them. The story is incredibly warm, funny, gut-wrenching and powerful.\n\nThe performance here is terrific and worthy of an Oscar. Michelle Williams gives an unforgettable performance as the mother, Mitzi. She shows how caring yet weird of a mother she is but shows how she is gradually getting more and more broken as the movie progresses. She could have easily made her character incredibly hatable but her performance succeeds in making the audience sympathize with her despite her being the main cause of the rift in the family. Paul Dano is also terrific as the dad, Burt. His performance is less eccentric and more subtle but he perfectly conveys the internal struggle of the character. Gabriel LaBelle plays Sammy and he is great. His character is sort of arrogant and Gabriel manages to convey that without being overly pompous and annoying.  LaBelle is terrific at communicating a young kid whose emotions are on the verge of exploding. He is a very promising young actor. In terms of supporting actors, Judd Hirsch appears for only two scenes yet he gives such a strong performance that takes over the scene. David Lynch also appears in just one scene but his scene might be the most memorable moment in the film.\n\nThe music is composed by legendary composer John Williams and he continues to do a great job. Although, the score here isn't his most memorable. The cinematography is done by Janusz Kaminski of Schindler's List fame and he continues to be great here. There are tons of great and memorable shots that capture the essence of filmmaking in The Fabelmans. There is an amazing shot that has Sammy using his hands as a screen with a projector aimed at his palm which is stunning. If I had any issue with the film then it has to be the 2nd act with Sammy in high school. Scenes concerning Sammy's romance and his bullying are a little uninteresting compared to everything else. It doesn't help that his girlfriend feels very over the top and the bullies act like all the generic jocks you have seen over a dozen times. Fortunately, the high school stuff have a strong landing.\n\nOverall, Steven Spielberg continues to show that he is still one of the best directors out there. Despite the film being a semi-biographic on him, he doesn't shy away from the flaws of him and his parents. He shows the struggle of chasing your passion which might resonate with a lot of people. If Spielberg decided this was his last film then this would've been a great final outing. However, from this film alone, I know he loves making films and he won't stop here. I can't wait to see his next work.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has been the most popular film director of the last fifty years but he's never turned the focus squarely on himself, and that's the draw of The Fabelmans, a coming-of-age drama that's really a coming-of-Spielberg expose. The biographical movie follows the Fabelman family from the 1950s through the late 60s as Sammy (our Steven\u00a0 Spielberg avatar) becomes inspired to be a moviemaker while his parents' marriage deteriorates. As a lifelong lover of movies and a childhood amateur filmmaker, there's plenty here for me to connect with. The fascination with recreating images, of chasing after an eager dream, of working together with other creatives for something bigger, it's all there and it works. I'm a sucker for movies about the assemblage of movie crews, those found families working in tandem. However, the family drama stuff I found less engaging. Apparently Sammy's mother (Michelle Williams) is more impulsive, spontaneous, and attention-seeking, and may have some un-diagnosed mental illness at that, whereas his father (Paul Dano) is a dry and boring computer engineering genius. I found the family drama stuff to be a distraction from the storylines of Sammy as a budding filmmaker experimenting with his art and Sammy the unpopular new kid at high school harassed for being Jewish. There are some memorable scenes, like a girlfriend's carnal obsession with Jesus, and a culmination with a bully that is surprising on multiple counts, but ultimately I found the movie to be strangely remote and lacking great personal insight. This is why Spielberg became the greatest filmmaker in the world? I guess. I'll credit co-writer Tony Kushner (West Side Story, Lincoln) for not making this what too many modern author biopics have become, a barrage of inspirations and connections to their most famous works (\"Hey Steven, I want you to meet our neighbor, Ernest Thalberg, or E.T. as we used to call him back at Raiders U.\"). The Fabelmans is a perfectly nice movie, with solid acting, and the occasional moment that really grabs hold of you, like a electrifying meeting with a top Hollywood director in the film's finale. For me, those moments were only too fleeting. It's a family drama I wanted less family time with and more analysis on its creator.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

Michelle Williams and Paul Dano star as his parents, who support the young filmmaker despite family troubles and moving from place to place due to Dad's job.

I was also impressed by the way it simplified directing lingo to a palatable state for a general audience. And despite being a somewhat niche film, it's surprisingly relatable for anyone who has ever been passionate about anything (i.e. everyone).\n\nA masterpiece of writing, acting, and directing, The Fabelmans is a lovely film that I can't recommend highly enough.",

The whole cast in the film did a great job including Gabriel LaBelle, Michelle Williams, and Paul Dano and even though Judd Hirsch was in it for a little bit but he did a great job as well. The cinematography throughout the film from the beginning to the end was great and John William's score was great as well from beginning to end. Steven Spielberg never disappoints in this filmmaking. This film was emotional throughout and I thought this film portrayed his young life very well and I hope another one comes out where it explores during his whole career with the whole cast again showing the early days of him making the movies and related because it would be worth it. The film had many funny and sad moments throughout the film. There aren't much movies made that are based on the young life of movie directors and I'm glad this one was made and there should be more of them. This film portrayed the young life of Steven Spielberg very well and it was so unexpected and this film really pays tribute to Steven Spielberg's parents very well and also pays tribute of how Steven Spielberg became the director he was today of how he was influenced to become a filmmaker as a child to his early life. This film is one of his best movies that he created that he took his time to make that was worth it and wasn't a big box office hit because this film was different and made for a different audience than his other movies, but this film is one of his top great movies that he made including Jurassic Park, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Schindler's List, the Indiana Jones franchise, Jaws, Close Encounters of the third Kind, Saving Private Ryan, Minority Report, Munich, Catch Me If You Can, Lincoln, War Horse, Bridge of Spies, The Post, Ready Player One, and West Side Story.

It feels like Spielberg is just pouring his heart out on screen and we're watching. The performances here are absolutely incredible from everyone involved, Paul Dano is amazing here per usual, and Michelle Williams is at her best here. Gabriel LaBelle is outstanding in his breakout role, playing a fictionalized version of Spielberg himself. Whatever the film needs to convey each actor is on their A-game, which can also be attributed to Spielbergs brilliant directing.\u00a0I think this will go down as one of the best films released this year, and a top ten Spielberg feature. This is easily my favorite film released this year so far, I haven't felt this deeply connected with a film like this in a very long time. While films like Everything Everywhere All At Once\u00a0and The Banshees of Inisherin\u00a0are definite contenders for my number one this year, The Fabelmans\u00a0means a lot more to me than both of those incredible films.

Given a camera from his mother to help as an outlet for his creativity, Sammy manages to capture an act that will tear his family apart if shown. A love letter to the events of his past, director Steven Spielberg uses Sammy to relay to the audience the pains of growing up Jewish in a post-World War II era as well as the joys of his life's calling.\n\nWith the continuing trend of older directors looking back and retelling imagined versions of their youth (Belfast, Armageddon Time), Spielberg proves yet again that he's one of the masters of the craft. Showing the slow dissolving relationship of the Fabelman family as contrasted with Sammy's growing love and talent for storytelling gives the movie the necessary weight while not being shy to inject moments of humor throughout. A point of interest that Spielberg intentionally plays with is the magic of movies as a use of escapism; for most moviegoers, a movie is a great way to forget life's ills for a couple of hours and be swept away to far flung lands said audience may never get the chance to experience for themselves. Unfortunately, in The Fabelmans, it's Sammy's discovery while editing film that really kickstarts the unravelling of the family. Full of heart, emotion, a love of movies and the process behind the making of them, The Fabelmans never gets too saccharine or overly sentimental; Spielberg rides a perfect line between dreamy nostalgia and melancholic remembrance.\n\nStarring Gabriel LaBelle, The Fabelmans shows the makings of an excellent young actor who's poised to have an amazing career. Confident, funny, cold, and extremely vulnerable at times, LaBelle is the movie's brightest spot. With his easygoing charm, it's easy for audiences to immediately latch onto LaBelle as his portrays Sammy Fabelman, the Steven Spielberg stand-in for the story. There's times Spielberg perfectly captures the wonder on LaBelle's face, primarily when Sammy is shooting or editing a movie. While not as strong in some of the film's more emotional scenes, specifically those with his parents, LaBelle still manages to provide an overall impressive performance, especially in the shoes he's filling.\n\nAlso starring Michelle Williams and Paul Dano as Sammy's parents, it's not immediately clear why either actor took these roles. It's not until late in the film where Michelle Williams really starts heating up and giving a great performance that it's clear to see why she accepted the role. Williams cruises along through the movie, but in two powerful scenes kicks into a higher gear where the audience is reminded that she's a four-time Academy Award nominated actress. There are depths of sadness to Mitzi Fabelman, and Williams swims those depths with the skill of a well-seasoned sailor. The pain, the attempts to hide the pain, and the depression that battles Mitzi throughout the film make for some of the more poignant scenes in the movie.\n\nFor his part, Paul Dano's performance is incredibly subdued in a way that only Paul Dano can do. Fresh off his take as The Riddler in Matt Reeves' The Batman, Dano does a come about-face here as the soft spoken, loving father figure of the The Fabelmans' household. As a technological wizard, Burt Fabelman uses his skills and saavy to increase his family's station in life, although some of the family moves seem to have ulterior motives behind them. While never spoken aloud in Burt's presence, there's a secret that hangs about the family that Dano manages to squeeze every drop of doubt from. With an incredible internal performance, this role of Burt Fabelman is one of Dano's best.\n\nIt'd be criminal to not give a mention to veteran actor Judd Hirsch. Appearing in only three scenes in the film, it's the second scene, the meat of his time on screen, that Hirsch steals every bit of shine from Gabriel LaBelle and takes him to acting class. Charming, funny, and still deadly serious, Sammy's great uncle Hersch lays down for Sammy the two paths that face him in life. Almost a monologue with brief interruptions from Sammy, Boris provides one of the year's best scenes as a character who drops a bit of backstory for Mitzi as well as being the catalyst for Sammy. Hirsch's performance speaks to decades of screen and theater work, nailing his timing while dispensing his life advice and had he more screen time, Hirsch could've had a clear shot at a Supporting Actor nomination.\n\nDirected by Steven Spielberg, The Fabelmans shows a storyteller entering his sixth decade of moviemaking still retaining the ability to produce stories that inspire awe and wonder. It's never easy to adapt and fictionalize one's life into a story for mass consumption, but Spielberg does so in a way that neither paints him as a saint nor asks the audience for pity. While it's unlikely that Spielberg will reveal which elements are real, which are embellished, and which are completely fabricated, that fact that all three blend so seamlessly together shows just how he and writer Tony Kushner are (this being their fourth collaboration behind Munich, Lincoln, and West Side Story). From a directorial standpoint, Spielberg doesn't bring anything new or flashy out of the toolbox. Unlike West Side Story, which features some impressive feats of cinematography, timing, and coordination, here in The Fabelmans he turns it down a notch, preferring to keep the focus off his talents and on his fictionalized family.\n\nOverall, The Fabelmans is one of the year's more heartfelt stories. A fictionalized retelling of the youth of one of the best living filmmakers, Spielberg shows both the ugly sides and the bright sides of his life in a way that keeps the audience engaged and locked in. Knowing how the story ends makes the journey even more entertaining; seeing Sammy's love and appreciation for filmmaking blossom and mature gives the audience an insight into the life of a man who's dedicated his to the art of storytelling. With excellent performances from the three main leads, as well as one powerfully raw scene with Judd Hirsch, The Fabelmans stands as one the best movies to start winding down the year.",

The film is absolutely emotional; it's mainly about family and deals with the vicissitudes of family interaction while paying homage to cinema.\n\nAs a kid, Sam Fabelman learns an important lesson from his father, one of the basic principles of filmmaking: retinal persistence. Like magic, films are a simple succession of still images which gives the illusion of movement. When Sammy attends his first movie projection the event turns into a life changing experience. The story follows his life while he discovers his passion for movie making supported by his family: his dad Burt (Paul Dano), his mother Mitzi (Michelle Williams), his 3 sisters, and his uncle Ben (Seth Rogen). His father is an electrical engineer, his mother a concept piano player and the fusion of technicality with art certainly shaped his craft. The family's dynamic was beautiful yet cloudy at times; a source material turned in melodrama, perfect for great storytelling.\n\nI love the humanity that The Fabelmans displays. And I loved the way the film showed and captured Sam's life overall, in the sense that it didn't just feel like you were watching a story. As the audience I could really understand and feel the emotions Sam was feeling. The core of the storyline are the characters and the relationships between them. Despite the Fabelmans are not a perfect family, they stand out in their unity and the bond between them. The relationship between Sam and his mom, masterfully performed by Michelle Williams, is mesmerizing to watch. There's a complicity that it is put to the test, generating wonderful conflict. Williams scenes are like study material for an actor. But every cast member is great at its craft in this film. The camera moves fluidly from the family dinners, to the action scenes contained in Sam's early films through the corners of the houses where the family moved and the places that hide the deepest family secrets. Janusz Kaminski's photography resembles the era and has the perfect warmth, and the score of John Williams stays in our hearts. The Fabelmans deserves a nomination on each major category in the upcoming Academy Awards: Best Film, Best Original Script, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Score and Williams and Dana most probably will nod Best Actress and Best supporting actor respectively.\n\nMy favorite scenes are Sam experimenting and reproducing the train crash he watched in his first movie experience and Mitzi watching herself in his son family movie. My favorite quote: \"Guilt is a waste of an emotion\" which I consider profoundly meaningful of what this movie is telling its audience. The message of the film is to be able to find balance in adversity. Families are not perfect, but true bond should prevail.\n\nThe Fabelmans is PG 13 due to mature thematic elements and brief violence and drug use.\n\nI give The Fabelmans 5 out of 5 starts and recommended for audiences 12 to 18 and adults. The Fabelmans opens in theaters November 23, 2022. By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST.",

With biographical drama, Spielberg takes nostalgic trips down memory lane reminiscing childhood pain motivated him make movies entertain. It's Spielberg's first attempts dramatize parent marriage deterioration set stage for his love of moving image, but he achieves deftly. Using captivating cinematography, Spielberg draws viewers into a teenager's journey of self-discovery coming to terms with his troubled upbringing pursuing passions for filmmaking. Emulating \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", Spielberg effectively utilizes lens flare showcase Sammy Fabelmans' awe-inspiring obsession with filmmaking profession. Recalling Roy Neary's laser-focus obsession with searching for aliens leading towards marriage deterioration, Sammy Fabelman becomes obsessed with shooting motions pictures against lens flare backgrounds. Spielberg showcases extraordinary controls over productions-design, costume and music, construct out-of-the-world movie-going experience. Spielberg effectively pays homage to his famous movies (ex. 1998's \"Saving Private Ryan\") through behind-the-scenes footage of films Sammy produces. Spielberg's screenplay is also sensational, creating compassionate portrait of teenager experiencing divorce repercussion through minimal dialogue. One appreciates marvelous performances. Gabriel LaBelle gives breakthrough performance as Sammy Fabelman. With smart expression, he conveys bravery, obsession and perseverance of adolescent whose obsession with making movies allows him overcome parent marriage deterioration. Michelle Williams is wonderful in role of mother possessing artistic skills supports her sons' dreams fulfills capturing moving stills even though it doesn't pay the bills. Williams imbues complexity into a mother experiences marriage deterioration using tone of voice. Finally, Paul Dano's dazzling. As sensitive father sheds tear when son states he doesn't want pursue engineer career, he brings heartbreaking emotion to the movie. Finally, \"The Fabelmans\" deserve appreciation for its universal message about determination pursue dreams forming bond aliens E.T. galaxies expeditions. Recalling \"E.T. The Extraterrestrial\", Spielberg discusses universal themes of child-like innocence, divorce and community which everyone will relate towards. As film-buff whose hobbies always clashed with professional responsibilities, I related with Sammy Fabelman. Hence, \"The Fabelmans\" is one of those special movies offering wide-ranging appeal. Fans of Steven Spielberg will definitely enjoy \"The Fabelmans\" and so will movie-goers seek heartwarming entertainment. Like flipping through nostalgic images of a photo album captured Jurassic-Park paleontologists stored households torn apart by E.T. divorce tragedies, it brought back fond memories of my own childhood stare up at skies searching Close-Encounters-of-the-Third-Kind galaxies enduring bullying for A.I.

Covering a span of about fifteen years, The Fabelmans finishes with a spectacular scene of Gabriel's meeting with famed director John Ford (David Lynch), clearly based on Spielberg's own meeting with the crusty master of American cinema.  The acting throughout is brilliant, including a short but impactful performance by Judd Hirsch as Gabriel's uncle, some beautifully rendered scenes (Gabriel's mother watching a film in the closet, a turning point in the movie), and plenty of insightful and touching dialogue.  The movie lags a bit when the family initially moves to California, but otherwise, it is one of Spielberg's best films.",

She was astounding. Paul Dano & Seth Rogen totally inhabited their characters. Everyone seemed born to play these parts. I was also tickled by a handful of cameos that make this film just that much more special. It's long and character driven. It's not for everyone, but for those to whom it resonates, it is one that will be a cherished and rewatched item in their film collection.

I loved the family that was so dysfunctional - it added to the journey and reason that Spielberg made the world of filmmaking his chosen mission in life.  The characters were interesting, but a bit shallow, as they were almost stereo-typical...I remember when the late Neil Simon did his trilogy plays that became films - especially his Brighton Beach memoirs.  That was an everlasting example of a tightly knit, Jewish family who learned to exist with each other - this however, lost the family charisma..and was a tad bland in the expectations of the characters - almost as if Spielberg did not want great performances, he used great actors, but the finished product was a bit too generic.  Tony Kushner (Angels in America) is a fabulous co-producer and writer - he is one of the greats of all time - but the lack of total emotional involvement in the portrayals left off that extra star.  I know that I am probably one of the few who gave it only four stars - but - I am also quite observant and knowledgeable of his better works and those of Mr. Kushner.  Guys - it shoulda/coulda been magnificent if only there was more angst and empathy happening.  It is still a must see film, but do not say - it is Spielberg and Kushner that gives it a full five star - realize that if you did not know who collaborated upon it, you would feel differently..BTW - I am a fan of bot gentlemen!",

Not to give the whole story away, but their decisions were mostly poor ones, and not the kind of example parents should be for their children.

            "content": "\"The Fabelmans\" is nothing short of Spielberg's magnum opus. It is a masterful film, as one would expect! As well, it is of course deeply personal and intimate at the same time \u2014 we really get a chance to get inside Spielberg's head more than ever before. We truly get to see the world through his eyes for once; see the childhood life he lived that inspired the way he would approach so many of the films that we have come to love. But that isn't what really struck me so immensely with this film; while I loved this exploration of his past through his family life, religion, friends and film, I adore this film because it helped me find myself. There were a scarily high amount of moments I was watching and found myself thinking how I would do the same thing, from visualizing shots with toys as a kid, to turning to films to help processing my emotions, to inner conflicts between following dreams of pursuing film or doing what is best for the family or future. Not to say I am some sort of up and coming Spielberg; I for sure am not, but I could identify myself in the character of Sammy (who is essentially the film's version of Spielberg). This film was an incredible experience for me to watch. The film brought me back to how I first fell in love with movies; and I am indebted to it for that. This film spoke to me on a deeper level than any film ever has, it touched my soul.\n\nI treasure Steven Spielberg; his work is some of my favourite pieces of cinema I have ever seen. To see him offer us the chance to explore his love of cinema and his own path to finding his way into the movie making business was magical. And this movie is him at his very best; it is much more than just autobiographical. This film is the most vulnerable Spielberg has felt as a storyteller, every shot was very clearly a memory. It is a poignant examination of coping with life's unexpected hurdles through art, even when you don't understand why. It's about how artists cope by creating something to occupy that empty space in themselves. \"The Fabelmans\" should speak to anyone who has ever struggled with their voice, communicating to their parents about what they want to pursue and that their passion is not just a phase. Especially when life changes in ways we can't control, while art is something we direct. Boiled down, it's about the power of movies and how they can change one's life, seen through the lens of a simple family drama. I loved how Spielberg portrayed his parents; the relationship he had with them and their divorce, as it had such a profound impact on his filmmaking, from \"Close Encounters\" to \"ET\" to \"Catch Me if You Can\". Through doing this, Spielberg shows how therapeutic it can be to express and see life expressed in a heightened and crafted way. It is just pure brilliance.\n\nSpielberg proves there is no one else like him; cinema would be so much less rich without his vision and style. His storytelling and visual sensibilities are pitch perfect, the choices he makes are objectively the best ways to tell the story he wants to tell. The direction is of course impeccable \u2014 you feel the magic of filmmaking through Spielberg's direction, a feeling one rarely gets with cinema these days. Everything, from the staging, cinematography, lighting, production design, costuming, music (John Willams' score, while minimal, is perfect), editing and especially acting is stunning. We don't get movies like this anymore, it is just so rich in every aspect! \n\nThe acting was very notable in this movie. Spielberg really knows how to cast the perfect actors for a role, and this might just be some of his best casting yet. First off, Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are both incredible in their roles, delivering impressive performances that will be easy award contenders. David Lynch and Judd Hirsch have some awesome, scene stealing cameos that were some of my favourite moments in the film. But the true star is Gabriel LaBelle, who plays Sammy, our young Spielberg. This might just be the best breakout performance I have ever seen from a young actor, and it is certainly one of the best performances of the year! I fully believed him as a young Spielberg, you see his awkwardness, but also how his love of cinema and filmmaking informs his life. Plus he looked exactly like Spielberg himself at that age, and was such a great lead for this film!\n\nUltimately this movie is one that I will love for years to come. This movie gave me the greatest insight into one of the greatest directors alive, as well as to myself as well. If you want to know how I see the world, this movie shows it off exactly. I don't think I've ever connected with a movie more than I did with this one. The movie shows why movies are so important, and it helps that you really feel the magic of film with this one as well! It is a celebration of cinema, of filmmaking, and it gives you an even greater amount of respect and appreciation for Spielberg himself. I loved it, more than I can ever put into words. I love a lot of movies, but I have a different type of love for this movie that is higher than most. This movie touched my soul, it's an ode to the thing I love most in the world; the movies.",

If I was Queen, Id say screw the turkey and save the Christmas (Or Hanukkah) gift money and lets do an activity philanthropic donations and bowling perhaps.\n\nI say this to introduce how I felt about The Fablemans, directed by Steven Spielberg which he co-wrote with Tony Kushner. Meaning, most of the adults were acting on an annoying stage play hyperbolic level while the kids were believable, led by the ideal super actor and Spielberg teenage representative, Gabrielle LaBelle.\n\nPaul Dano was decent as the nerd scientist Dad whos enamored by his wifes histrionics, ignoring her fixation on his best friend (Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen respectively). Williams and Rogen took part of the fun of of this film for me, due to the aforementioned, adults are boring thesis. Their acting was eye rollingly annoying, so schmaltzy you wondered who could even stand being in the same room with them. But I guess thats why they were meant to be together. Judd Hirsch, while also melodramatic, as an Uncle of Williams, made more sense to me (who doesnt have an out there Uncle?).\n\nThe teenage high school rom com section was spot on which is saying something since Im usually allergic to the cliche high school bullies, first romance, yada yada. Here, I was riveted with breathtaking scenes between LaBelle and Chloe East as well as LaBelle and Sam Rechners hallway scene (all three definitely future stars). These moments were complex on a level that the adult parts were not. Fortunately the kids took over this movie in time and grandeur and made this holiday film worth participating in.",

If you have ever tried to be an artist, are a struggling artist or grew up in a family that valued practicality and physical tools but downplayed art and conceptual things, this film will hit home. Even though it's a pretty standard coming-of-age story, I see people giving it bad reviews or saying they didn't understand the story and that's probably because this may be Spielberg's most Jewish film yet. Not Jewish in the obvious and overt way them being hunted by Nazis, struggling during the wars etc. Instead the film is very Jewish culturally and dramatically from songs that are sung and dinners to humor and dialogue. People may not have expected that (I didn't) but maybe it's due to having Jewish friends that I found the humorous parts hilarious and the overall story entertaining.  Again at its core it's a coming-age-story and a family drama, so it's smaller in scope and topic compared to Spielberg's other movies. \"The Fabelmans\" is probably my favorite dramatic film of the year. \n\n\nIf you want more of my film/TV thoughts follow me: @MedleyMovies",

This film misses the mark by a landslide. Steven Spielberg blew what could have been a great story. It has wonderful actors doing their best with what they were given, but it doesn't have any heart or soul and there is absolutely no emotional connection between the audience and the characters onscreen. Most egregious of all, is Steven Spielberg's total lack of balls... this film is too safe and in no way brave. Total dud.

Terrible casting in my opinion - Paul Dano is one dimensional and feels like a cliche of a cliche of a cliche, while Seth Rogan should just stay in his lane and stick to fart jokes. \n\nCredit where credit is due - they nailed the production design (even though I always wonder why everything looks so clean - resulting in people looking like they are wearing costumes instead of actually living, breathing humans). The super-8 movie sequences are very fun, and again, glimpses of brilliance in some of the editing scenes as well...\n\nOverall - a total mess!",

This story, brought to life through a screenplay co-written by Spielberg and Tony Kushner, literally speaks to you and resonates with anyone of any age who aspires to be an artist in any field.\n\nThe rest of the performances are terrific, with Michelle Williams as Sammy's mother Mitzi being a major standout, same with Paul Dano as Sammy's father Burt, and Judd Hirsch, who gives a memorable monologue as Sammy's great uncle Boris. These 4 performances deserve tons of award nominations. The cinematography is beautiful, as we can all expect from the great Janusz Kaminski. John Williams' score, while a bit more subdued and minimalist this time due to it being mostly driven by piano, suits the film's uplifting tone, no matter what people think of it. Highly recommended and for sure to be a major Best Picture contender for this year's Oscars. Go see it on the biggest screen possible if you can.",

While it may have presented a vulnerable review of Spielberg's life, which is a gift in and of itself, the movie was rambling and disconnected. Far too long. A couple of folks in our theater actually left in the middle of the movie. While the acting is wonderful, the screenplay is wanting. As Rex Reed said, the movie is \"only intermittently interesting and less than what I'd call mesmerizing.\"",

There are no words to describe how she was brought to life on the big screen by Chloe East, you just have to go see it yourself    Monica was incredibly meaningful especially because she was pulled from Steven\u2018s  Spielberg's  real life.   All of the characters truly performed and transported you back in time.  This movie is a must see!",
