This is because the character in the movie is religious and according to \"critics\", it's the wrong religion (Hinduism). WATCH IT. \n4. Not the usual Bollywood BS with dance and action scenes. This is made in Hollywood style storytelling. WATCH IT \n5. Tells the real life story of a one-in-100-million genius who refused a job offer at NASA given by the President of USA himself. \"Critics\" who abuse/ashame their motherland hate this level of patriotism. WATCH IT.\n6. Depicts also the story of a nation who's govt itself act to destroy the nation's scientific progress. A story of India prior to 2014. WATCH IT.",
