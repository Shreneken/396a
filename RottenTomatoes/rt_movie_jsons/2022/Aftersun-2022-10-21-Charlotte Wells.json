    "summary": "At a fading vacation resort, 11-year-old Sophie treasures rare time together with her loving and idealistic father, Calum (Paul Mescal). As a world of adolescence creeps into view, beyond her eye Calum struggles under the weight of life outside of fatherhood. Twenty years later, Sophie's tender recollections of their last holiday become a powerful and heartrending portrait of their relationship, as she tries to reconcile the father she knew with the man she didn't, in Charlotte Wells' superb and searingly emotional debut film.",

If you liked that, you might like this.  \n\nThe acting *is* good, but it is disturbingly slow and the flashing lights scenes made my head hurt. If you're prone to migraines, you might want to pass. \n\nGlad we rented and didn't buy it. Wont watch it again and wont recommend it.",

            "content": "To say this is a slow movie about a divorced dad/daughter on a trip says you just missed the whole point. It's a quietly emotional film with multiple small, heartbreaking bits of mental health reality woven into what should have been just another childhood vacation memory. I do think the movie speaks louder and more true to those personally familiar with the crushing struggle of deep depression, but it's equally interesting and actually important for others to see the effort Dad puts into trying to just be \u2018normal', wearing that mask that anyone intimately aware will immediately recognize. The truth of all that  may feel a little uncomfortable as it slices in and out of the light moments but that seems to be the director's intention. I think it was beautifully acted and edited; the heavy heart you'll feel may help you to listen more carefully in your own life.",

            "content": "It's not often I outwardly want to review a movie, but I just wasted \u00a34.50 on renting this movie and I want to spare someone else the same fate. It's truly one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Think those artistic long dragging focus shots of banal things. For example, 3 mins of Mescal smoking a cigarette and moving around the balcony. 2 min shot of his breathing underneath a blanket. Just because a film is well acted and has a couple of artistic scenes, doesn't make it a good movie. There is no plot, and look vacation artsy movies can be good: The Descendants for example. This was just dull, boring, and thinks way too highly of itself. \n\nSo we're *Spoiler* watching a girl who in present tense is watching old footage of a holiday and remembering her dad when she was young. Although, this resort holiday she's remembering has absolutely no substance to it. \n\nHe's just a normal dad and she's a normal girl. They have nothing interesting about them, there's a total lack of plot. I don't know who this movie is for, other than just for people like Mescal, who is great, but for people like him to secure BAFTAs and emmys for a movie that realistically wasn't good but for art's sake we'll pretend it was so moving. \n\nAs I say, I can handle movies of this nature, The Descendants, Call Me By Your Name, etc, all holiday focused movies. But the difference with them was that there was 1) plot, and 2) the location was idyllic. \n\nThe only thing I think this movie probably invokes is just remembering to look back and remember how you love someone, and remember your family. Hold on to precious memories and youth. \n\nBut frankly, this movie has as much depth as a \"live laugh love\" wall sticker. And even then, at least that statement is clear and knows what it is.\n\nWhat is aftersun other than just another slow paced artsy film?",
