I have to caution that it's 3 hours long, but it goes by quickly, or watch it streaming in two sittings if you must. It's also got gallons of blood so it's not for the kiddies. It's a fictional story about two real heroes of India's revolution, Raju (Ram Charan) and Bheem (NT Rao Jr), against the British Raj in the 1920s. They never met in real life but the film supposes they did. The two handsome stars become friends not knowing they are on opposite sides. A little girl, Bheem's sister, is kidnapped by the British. While they try to rescue the girl, Bheem falls in love with the governor's niece. And then one has to wonder if the men's friendship can ever survive what befalls them. The action and stunts are astounding, The sets are colorful. The music and choreography excel. You won't be able to get the tunes out of your head. You have to take that leap of faith that two men could have such extraordinary strength. But this story of their friendship and their fight against the Raj as they try to rescue the girl is amazing. RRR supposedly means Rise Revolt and Roar, or else it stands for the initials of the two stars and the director (SS Rajamoulli, the Spielberg of India). There are subtitles. The symbolism abounds, for those knowledgeable of Hindu or Telegu custom, but for me, that went over my head. I loved this anyway. And, those two men can dance!",

I've never seen such powerful and explosive physical prowess of the main actors who switch from action fighting to in-synch dancing!  We need to see more Indian movies! There's been such a surge or hero movies in the West that RRR blows them all away.  This means we need to invite movies from India and the world!

Started out as a search for a kidnapped girl, then devolving into a revenge/ pursuit film, then turns sharply into a sort of quest film. 5. Sub-titles would have been nice, as the characters all mumble. 6. I didn't like the anti-British aspect, which i think, and hope, was exaggerated, especially the cruelty. Britain could NOT have ruled India all those many decades by being mean to its citizens. 7. The characters are super-natural, which made us think it was either a comedy or a fantasy. The stunts are way over the top with imagination. 8. Disliked all the song and dance scenes--- is this a musical???? Again, too long and confusing. It dragged in the middle, and toward the end I thought it was over. It should have been. Too much. Too many stories, too many characters, too much of everything. I suppose this kind of thing is popular in India and with the counter-culture crowd? I was glad when it finally ended. Sorry, didn't like it. I was rooting for the tigers.",

Our protags are Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) and Raju (Ram Charan), whose stories are given equal screen time, with one's being much more intricate than the other. Everything is over-the-top, from the cartoonishly evil villains (Ray Stevenson, Allison Doody, Edward Sonnenblick) to the use of exotic, wild animals as weapons. The tone is set when Raju engages in a Kill Bill-like fight scene to retrieve a malcontent from an angry mob. RRR arises out of \"Tollywood,\" or the Telugu-language film center in Southern India. It is filled with song and dance, some more understandable than others. For instance, the \"hook dance\" scene moves along the plot, as the dance itself is a scene showing that the Indians can defeat the pretentious British in a dance-off. Other dance numbers seemed random and superfluous, merely padding an already extensive run-time. The side-story of Bheem and Jenny (Olivia Morris) was forced and merely inserted to show that not all of the white people were terrible. RRR is a spectacle of national pride and definitely does what movies of this grandiosity are meant to do: entertain.",

It's one of the very best films of 2022. \n\nWith all the accolades and nominations it has been receiving and the uniqueness that sets itself apart from the other films make it a nomination-worthy for Best Picture at the 95th Academy Awards because it is indeed one of the best pictures of 2022!\n\nAfter multiple viewing:\nOH MY GOD!!! I never thought this would ever happen! Steven Spielberg and S S Rajamouli having a conversation about their films! Wow! A testament that Mr. Rajamouli has really made something special! \n\nRRR was far from my radar to be honest. Though I always say to everyone that I welcome all types of films, different genres, from different countries but Indian Cinema has always been one of my least favorites. Not anymore! RRR has opened my eyes and changed the way I look at Indian Films\u2026 It's an astonishing introduction not only to Tollywood Cinema (Telugu Language, different from Bollywood, Hindi Language) but also to, how large Indian Cinema really is and what Indian Cinema can bring to the table..\n\nI'm a huge fan of RRR now and will not stop spread the word of how great it is. I've seen it more than ten times at this point. 2022 was a great year for films, though there's a lot more that I have not seen but RRR was an amazing addition to last year's very best films\u2026 It's my favorite film of 2022. \n\nRRR is truly unforgettable!

That's why only after watching the trailer, I realized that Raju will also be against the British government. And yes raju and bhim's friendship happened by just an event i mean such a deep friendship may take time,A movie based on such friendship will be unique for America,but it is very common in India.\n4) characters are to cartoony, Raju's character has some character development , But Bheem's character was very one-dimensional\nRRR's characters lacks depth, \nThis is the condition of commercial movies in India, they don't understand the importance of character's depth, they don't understand the importance of a good villain in the movie,\nI could not connect with the characters,i could not connect with their friendship, I did not feel anything real in it. i need little bit of subtlety to connect with their bond more\nI was not interested in the story and characters of the film because I have seen many such stories and characters many times in Indian cinema\n5) honestly in some scenes Rrr's CGI was not good \nAnd I have problem with comedy in rrr, you will get to she this in many indian films that a desi boy falls in love with a foreign girl ,but our desi boy does not know how to speak English which creates comedy, whole name pronouncing thing was so lame and such an old trick to create comedy\nFinally I don't hate rrr it's better than other trash Indian comercial films like pathaan, kgf and pushpa but I don't think that Rrr is the best movie of 2022\nOver all 7/10 for me\nRemember everyone's opinion and taste is different, you have every right to dissagree with me,If everyone had the same opinion, than websites like rotten tomatoes wouldn't exist.",

Is that intentional, for effect?\nI've never been one for musical type movies, either, so that didn't work for me. And the CGI, which I normally don't have an issue with, was pretty glaring in how obvious it was.

Loose is an understatement. It's so loose that it is falling apart - apart from reality that is. \n\nA reviewer at RogerEbert.com describes British Governor Scott (played by Ray Stevenson) as a \"cartoonishly evil\" character. True enough, but that's because everyone and everything in the whole damned movie is cartoonish! Calling one character from this absurdity \"cartoonish\" is absurd. It's like singling out Elmer Fudd as \"the funny animated one\" from the \"Looney Tunes\" series.\n\nI initially did not want to watch this because I feared that it would be like viewing a three hour video game (yes, it's running time is 3 hours and 7 minutes). But, since we have a Netflix subscription, and it was an offering, we decided to give it a try. I wasn't wrong about the video game fears. The film does have that look.\n\nSurprisingly, we were not disappointed in the film's overall entertainment value. Actually, we were quite amused by all the insane scenes and we both frequently laughed out loud. \n\nBut this raises the question, \"Is RRR a comedy?\" To be honest, I'm not sure. Every description I've read labels it a drama. But really? If the producers were looking for drama, then why frame your intended seriousness in the goofiest, craziest, wildest cinematic nonsense of the year?\n\nDue to all of its rib-tickling silliness, I'm giving this movie a marginally positive rating. If it is not supposed to be funny, well, I'll recommend it anyway. Who doesn't need a good laugh these days?",

When a young village girl is taken away by a mean British governor's wife (cue pantomime hissing), NTR Jr's kind but extremely skillful tribal leader Komaram Bheem is sent to Delhi to bring her back. En route, he befriends, in an unequivocally homoerotic/platonic manner with an action drama equivalent of a romcom meet-cute, Ramm Charan Teja's ruthlessly determined Rama Raju who has his own secret agenda and is coincidentally tasked to hunt down Bheem, except initially, both are unaware of the other's true identity. With plot development constantly taking a backseat to logic and physics-defying action sequences that are nevertheless stupidly entertaining and musical numbers that bring the film and its momentum to a shuddering halt, S.S. Rajamouli's film is a cornucopia of pleasures and eyeball-rolling insanity. For every rousing and ingeniously choreographed piggyback fight sequence with Bheem carrying an injured Rama, there's an incredulous herbal remedy conveniently available to magically heal Rama allowing him to run in minutes; whilst ropey special effects with the animals are almost forgotten (and forgiven) after a dazzling display rescuing a child from a burning train or an impressively mounted, infectious and totally bonkers dance-off spectacle, which in and of itself perfectly encapsulates a film this brazenly mainstream, manipulative and maximalist.",

Ram Charan and Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao Jr. play the characters of Bheem and Raju perfectly and they know how important these characters are for a lot of people in India and around the world. The creativity that RRR has to offer, is something I have never seen before until now, the stunt coordinators did a incredible job, at keeping the fights interesting and impactful. RRR sure has some flaws, the VFX are not always the greatest and i thought that the over use of low framerate slow-motion was a bit overdown, however those things come with the package of a Bollywood film and they give the movie their own identity. The dance sequences were so much fun to watch, with everybody giving it their all. I must give my compliments as well to the stunt guys, you guys really did some fenemonal stunts and took a lot of risks doing them. Overall RRR is a refreshing movie, something that Hollywood would never do and something that has made so many people around the world incredibly happy!",

They both have some great chemistry together and do a great job at developing their characters. S. S. Rajamouli's direction is really fun and so much better than his directing on Bahubali. The action is some of the most insane I've seen put to film ever. It's something that's hard to describe and is better being seen by your own eyes. You won't be disappointed though. It also has probably my favorite dance scene ever put to film as well. I honestly can't think of anything that tops it. When the film isn't action oriented or doing something fun then it can really drag. There's a 30-40 minute portion of the film that really drags on and on. Some of the performances here aren't exactly amazing also like from Alison Doody. If you want a really fun action and character oriented movie to watch with friends or on your own then I would highly recommend checking this out.",

I wasn't expecting another magnum opus, but I was expecting a gripping story, replete with incredible screenplay, clever action sequences and a fair share of twists and turns in the plot. RRR fails to deliver on all counts.\n\nI don't even know where to begin. Rajamouli takes too much time introducing the protagonists - the Fire and the Water analogies are meaningless and poorly concocted. One cannot but help wonder if all that wasted time in the movie could not have been used to develop a more interesting plot. The protagonists themselves are so bad in every respect that I can't even remember their character names in the movie. Compare that to the like Kattappa and Bhalla and Sivakami in Bahubali or even the relentless Fly in Naan Eee, and you soon run out of leeway. There is a weak attempt at justifying underdeveloped ideologies for the two main archetypes in the movie, and it is so poorly developed that it fails to hit the spot.\n\nThe plot meanders along aimlessly from one boring scene to another, with random characters weaving in and out like caricatures in a bad comic book. There is a scene where NTR gets to take a crack at a cop who unnecessarily roughs him up in an earlier sequence. Knowing Rajamouli, I was expecting more impact in that scene, but it was so predictable and poorly delivered, that it failed to leave any impression whatsoever.\n\nThere is an even weaker attempt in the movie at rekindling a romance, which goes nowhere - neither is it interesting, nor is it likeable. And the flashbacks are pathetic attempts to justify pointless ideologies that they are only a distraction in the movie, and best forgotten sooner rather than later. Characters like Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt have been thoroughly wasted, as are Shriya Sarin and Samuthrakani.\n\nThe music is ok, and the cinematography is ok, but the most important ingredient in any movie, the lowest common denominator, so to speak, is the story and the plot, and as hard as he has tried to piece something together in RRR, Rajamouli has failed miserably.\n\nIn sum, I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie. I hope the director finds his way again, and makes a compelling comeback in his next flick.\n\nThanks for reading!",

And especially given the context of the Indian Revolution, showing both its brutality while also making the experience both insightful and dramatic lends merit to the entire experience put to film. It really does feel like a modern epic, which is so antithetical to modern cinema, at least in the 2020s.\n\nFun is the name of the game. This is just fun. Its core keeps upping the ante.

This movie is a remarkable achievement for Indian action cinema, and for primarily one reason of the uttermost importance: it seamlessly mixes very classical, Shakespearean plot with mind-bending, incredibly creative action scenes that are made with skill and imagination becoming of artisans whose dwellings are no lower than at Mont Parnassus. Neither of those two are praiseworthy on their own \u2013 without the story \"RRR\" would be an empty action flick more akin to what Marvel and DC do in the US, and without the action will become a dull and overly simplistic period piece more akin to an umpteenth re-edition on \"Ben-Hur\". But this movie has both and they work, God, how they work to make this movie the best it could possibly be. Only at places (especially at the ending) it becomes too didactic and the viewer is reminded that it is also, at least in the smallest part, a propaganda piece, even if it states at the very beginning that it does not intend to be so. Forget that though, \"RRR\" is perhaps THE cinematic event of the year and you would be hard-pressed to find anyone who would event attempt to say otherwise.",

In the middle of the movie the plot takes a break to close a subplot, to give rise to tell us the denouement with another subplot in between and to continue trapping the viewer despite the great length of the film, with very well cared battles in photography, choreography and shots that embellish the heroes of the story. Negative points: like every Indian movie it is overacted but it makes it a little fun to watch; CGI in certain moments, mainly the animals, is a little weak that at certain points takes you away from the magical atmosphere in which the movie takes you.",

I will admit that I am not a huge fan of musicals and while I do love a good action movie, extremely over the top is something that is a turn off to me. Having said that RRR is a well made movie. That is the only praise that I can get it. The story is generic, which isn't too much of a strike against it. There are a lot of stories out there that have been repeated over and over again. The issue that I have with this movie is the extreme nature of the action. I do love a good over the top action movie but, there is something about how it's done that resonates more than anything else. Instead of coming off insanely awesome, the action seems more of a borderline parody. I had the same issue with the recent Fast and Furious 9. This movie comes off more like a live action cartoon, which can be extremely offputting. If you need a sense of groundedness to your action movies, this is not the movie for you. Overall, there are some moments that really do make the movie enchanting but for me those are few and far between.",

            "content": "Hollywood should be taking notes.  So this is a fictitious story about two legendary revolutionaries (N.T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan Teja) in India in the 1920s.  Their paths are on a collision course, but will they emerge as friends or foes?  Now I typically don't watch a whole lot of Bollywood.  It's for the same reason that I haven't gotten into all that much anime: the library is so extensive that I don't know the best place to start.  With RRR, however, too many of the right people have been saying the right things about it.  Perhaps it has something to do with it being the most expensive Indian movie ever produced, but regardless, I decided to give it a watch on the last day of my vacation.  After all, three hours is a pretty tall commitment, so what better time to watch than a day with no obligations?  RRR may take up a large portion of your day, but pound for pound, this is about the most bang you will ever get for your buck when it comes to watching a movie.  RRR is ridiculous in the best way possible.  Yes, it's outlandish, but it's honestly not that far off from the very best Marvel movies, with the only difference being that they aren't spelling out that these two guys have superpowers.  You will know exactly the kind of movie you are watching by the time you get to the title card.  Granted, that's at the 40-minute mark, but it's a wildly entertaining opening.  What I love about this movie is that it knows that it needs to keep topping itself.  Because they are aware of that, it keeps escalating, and it keeps your engagement heightened.  That makes it so you don't care about the extended runtime.  I'm not usually a fan of movies being this long, but there are always exceptions.  Personally, I took a couple of mini-breaks during the act shifts, but I was always excited to pick it right back up again.  This is a movie that kind of has it all.  Obviously, if you've watched a trailer or the autoplay Netflix bumper, you know that they have action covered, but there is also comedy, romance, singing, and expertly executed dance numbers.  What more could you ask for?  I only have a couple of minor quibbles for RRR.  I don't think the CGI on the animals is the best you've ever seen, but that might be for the best because they do some pretty crazy stunts with them, and nobody wants to see an animal in peril.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the English actors in this.  I'm not sure if S.S. Rajamouli is just better at directing people who speak Telugu, but the majority of the white actors felt like Imperial officers from Star Wars for the majority of this.  That said, these are pretty minor flaws, and I'm not going to hold it against this hugely enjoyable experience.  There's a solid chance that this will get promoted to a five-star movie if I give it a second watch, and let me tell you: I highly desire to watch this again.",

            "content": "While it was a long movie, the numerous plots converged into one massive hit that is RRR. Seeing something so outlandish, fun and action-packed was refreshing while trying not to be too serious about itself. I think if it were too serious, the depiction of British rule in India would have met backlash or not lend itself to a wider worldwide audience. It wanted to depict the struggles of being under colonial rule, as well as marrying depictions of well-known characters and gods in their culture. While some may find this to be nonsensical, especially the action scenes, personally, I think this was a benefit, because the British rule was harsh and cruel, and this may be harder for the wider audience to stomach. The costume design, set design and actor choice were impeccable. While the storyline was 3 hours long, it was gripping throughout! The multiple storylines created emotion as well as story and character development that was fulfilling. The FX used lent itself well to the outlandish nature of the movie, and used only during action scenes or montages. The music and dance used in the film was fantastic and fun, providing moments of relief and highlighting the relationships between the characters.",

For example, the introduction to Bheem's character of him catching a tiger was there to not only make him look cool but capturing the tiger actually had a purpose that was paid off later in the movie. All of the dramatic and over the top moments in this movie are like that; they are there for entertainment purposes but they also serve the overall story, and this is why I think this movie works so well. It was a perfect example of using crazy sequences in order to create better storytelling. I didn't mind the over the top moments because without them this story wouldn't have been as good and I wouldn't have cared about it as much. The movie made me love the two lead characters because it made them seem so cool and heroic, and this was thanks to the dramatic action and moments.

The CGI is a little overdone, and the terrible British dictatorship is a touch much, but it still looks good.

Make more interesting movies with better writing and maybe possibly, hopefully with a bit more believable fights that aren't so ridiculously inhuman that it just makes you scoff at how dumb it is. I'm hoping that this fake and unbelievable fighting that started with dabanng will end very soon because it just makes people cringe more than anything now.

The visuals, action, dancing, all of it - A++. \n\nMy only minor gripe would be that the plot was easy to figure out. It was not ground breaking by any means and it was clear to figure out what the \"twist\" was. This did not detract from my enjoyment of RRR at all, but if I had to find one thing to critique, this would be it.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed RRR. It was unlike anything I've ever watched and I am excited to explore more Indian cinema. Many thanks to Straw Hat Goofy for recommending this one on TikTok.",

The film them proceeds to be as whacked out as possible, as if Hunter S Thompson was filming Indian history.  The narrative and battle scenes made zero sense and were completely implausible.  I guess fine if you are making a cartoon, which is basically what this film is, replete with mustache twirling British baddies.

I imagine the rough American equivalent would be if Ben Franklin and George Washington teamed up in their younger years for a dash of revolutionary guerrilla warfare, but there's no way a Hollywood studio would be able to make that work. \n\nS. S. Rajamouli creates a sweeping film that is less concerned with the tightness of its writing (and certainly not with realism) as it is the visual spectacle; while the quality of the CG might not be up to the standard of other big-budget productions, RRR makes up for it largely with its willingness to use it in creative ways. In this director's world, emotion is the standard currency, so if we want a joyful dance-off between our two protagonists (who are again, real-life Indian revolutionaries) against an entire British garden party, we'll get one. With leads as charismatic as Ram Charan and Jr NTR, this script conveys just as much about male friendship as it does about the Indian struggle against the British Raj. Representative of quite a bit of what is distinctive and enjoyable about Indian film. (3.5/5)",

Jr NTR is only 5'5\" and in this movie he is shown crazy tall and bulky. Almost as big as a tiger. I am myself an Indian but these movies are selling false information.

Me and my boy actually wanted to give the dance a try. It won't be that good, but the point is that the actors were damn entertaining and amazing executing those moves. \n\nThe action scenes were just as badass. It's so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that I loved it. It's basically a superhero movie. The two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining. \n\nThe story itself was not bad, even though it dragged so much during the middle part. I was bored for a good chunk, waiting for more action scenes. The backstories didn't really add much to the present plot, even though they provided some more fun action. And of course, I didn't feel any emotional connection to any of the characters, as I just wanted this movie to be all about the over-the-top action.\n\nOverall, it's a highly entertaining movie that I had a great time even though there's still many problems with it. 7.5/10",
