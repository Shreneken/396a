I could tell this was the case because twists and big reveals were happening and I shrugged them off almost instantly. I can see why this movie might appeal to blockbuster fans, but I felt like the movie still could have benefitted from a better and more engaging story. It could have added stakes to some of the more intense action scenes and made for a more compelling experience. Overall, it is an okay movie to watch for some basic entertainment, but I can't see myself ever revisiting it because it's way too long and has too much going on.",

From his previous films, we could say connecting different parallel events and making all the characters from different scenarios coming all together for the final showdown is his prime talent. So, he is the best man to do this job of creating this fictional universe and He does this job exceptionally well. The events of kaithi are brilliantly connected to VIkram and Both share a really good Universe. We have some really good cameos (not to mention Actor Suriya's role that was lit) and the way the movie ends has really set up new ways for Kaithi 2 and Vikram sequel (and many more who knows!!).\n\nAll the actors in the film have done a really great job. You would become an instant fan of Kamal. Vijay Sethupathi has a really interesting characterisation who looks frightening and makes you laugh at the same time. Fahad Fahsil was Incredible. Even his eyes show different emotions. Seeing Suriya with this negative role was exciting and different but it was great. \n\nA really entertaining story. Watching Kaithi once would actually help you understand the plot more easily. The events of the film take place at a really high pace. So watching it twice would give you a better understanding. The story has a lot of twists throughout the film.Stunt Scenes were really entertaining!! (Anbariv just keeps on entertaining us movies after movies - beast,kgf2,etc). New Camera techniques were used perfectly. One would notice This technique was previously used in Master and Beast in small amounts.\n\nBGM was rocking. Anirudh proved once again why He is the Rockstar. Been giving hits after hits. All variations were awesome and perfectly used. \n\nThe only thing disappointing in this film is its VFX. They could have done better. We have seen scenes in Beast how the VFX have evolved in Kollywood. It's sad a film of this level has poor vfx. It degrades the viewing experience. Nevertheless, It is still highly entertaining. They need to get a better vfx in future films.\n\nFinal Verdict: A must watch. Action movie fans would love this film!! Try not to miss the big screens. A Highly entertaining movie which is rewatchable. Looking forward to the sequels.\n\nRating: 9.5/10",

Kamal Haasan and \"Loki\" might have been doing this for ages. Yet, in the age of Netflix, doing this is a bit more conspicuously shameful. A shallow characterisation, disjoint emotions, gratuitous violence, politically placed scenes for women, characters from even the American TV series \"Breaking Bad\"... The list is too long to explain why this is not a \"Pan-world\" film as many claim. If even an unwanted sixth installation of \"Ip Man\" is inspiring curiosity from foreigners, then a supposed cinematic universe receiving lacklustre response in North India can explain how the movie has little to offer apart from star power. For people who do not watch international media a lot in India, this might be a treat. The film even says its main villain is India's \"Pablo Escobar\" and lifts some concepts from \"Narcos\". Chiefly, the problem the film's hero seeks to address is not at all a problem in real life in India. A good chunk of scenes are just speeches in a neutral tone that is inimical to even entertainment. Vikram - not the Eastern European style revenge saga this advertised to be, an insult to everyone involved",

He returns with an Arnold Scwarzenegger like bravado, along with his trademark amazing acting skills. Its a film ardently made by a loving fan, Lokesh Kanagaraj, who not only makes it as a tribute to his favourite star, but also as an ardent movie lover as well. His way of action seemed to look like it peaked in Kaithi, but we, as the viewer, are thrust into a world in Vikram which will not only surprise you, but also engage you throughout. The first half plays out like an investigative thriller, focusing more on the brilliant characters played by Fahadh Fasil and Vijay Sethupathi. But once the story shifts fully on Kamal Haasan's Vikram, it sends the film into a careening, testosterone pumping, action filled thrill ride. Its a movie that focuses on the violence of the action and the story equally. There's a reason for whatever is happening, and the reasoning is done so well by Lokesh. Honestly, this is what big blockbuster films are made up to be! This is what tamil cinema should be heading to in terms of summer films, and if tamil cinema is headed to \"universe\" building cinema, this is a fucking amazing start! Kick ass film, and so worth the hype!",
