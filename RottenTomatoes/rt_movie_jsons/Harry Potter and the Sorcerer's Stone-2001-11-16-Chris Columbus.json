            "content": "Final Thoughts:\n\nHarry Potter would undoubtedly have been a classic in its book form, but, thanks to the cast and crew of the film adaptations, the series became a phenomenon. From detail-attentive storytelling to character castings that feel like the creators performed real magic to pull them from the pages, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone smartly uses its beefy runtime to tell an unmissable coming-of-age fantasy. A strong, old-timey feel creates distinct aesthetics, and John Williams' musical score is a special magic of its own.\n\nFor the full review and more posts like it, visit my site: https://thephoenixprjct.com",

From the moment the opening credits begin to roll, audiences are swept away by the stunning visuals, soaring score, and captivating performances.\n \nOne of the strengths of the film is its ability to capture the spirit of Rowling's beloved book series. From the charmingly British setting to the quirky characters, the movie perfectly captures the essence of the story. Fans of the books will delight in seeing their favorite scenes and characters brought to life on the big screen, while newcomers to the series will be captivated by the film's unique blend of magic and adventure.\n \nAt the heart of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is its trio of young heroes. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson shine as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively, bringing a perfect blend of humor, heart, and heroism to their roles. Radcliffe, in particular, is a revelation as Harry, imbuing the character with a vulnerability and determination that make him an instantly likable protagonist. Grint and Watson, meanwhile, provide strong support as Harry's loyal friends, bringing their own unique charms to the roles.\n \nThe supporting cast is equally impressive. Richard Harris is perfect as the wise and kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore, while Maggie Smith brings a stern authority to her role as Professor McGonagall. Alan Rickman is also outstanding as the snide and sinister Professor Snape, a character who becomes increasingly important as the series progresses. Together, the cast creates a rich and diverse tapestry of characters that are both memorable and engaging.\n \nVisually, the film is a feast for the eyes. The Hogwarts School is brought to life with breathtaking detail, from the moving staircases to the enchanted portraits lining the walls. The special effects are also impressive, particularly in the scenes involving Quidditch, a magical sport played on flying broomsticks. John Williams' iconic score is the perfect accompaniment to the action, conveying a sense of wonder and excitement that perfectly captures the spirit of the story.\n \nDespite its many strengths, however, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is not without its flaws. The pacing can be a bit uneven at times, with some scenes feeling rushed while others drag on. The film also has to condense a lot of material from the book, resulting in some important plot points feeling somewhat underdeveloped. At times, it can feel like the film is trying to cram too much into its two-hour runtime.\n \nThat being said, these criticisms are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a film that will capture the hearts and imaginations of viewers young and old. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and a reminder of the magic that can be found in even the most ordinary of places. With its charming characters, breathtaking visuals, and timeless story, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" is a true classic of modern cinema and a must-see for anyone who loves movies or magic.",

It's all all of them and when watching continuously, it's very fun. If the movie comes out at each time, I think I am one of them that will definitely follow the story of this story and is a movie that can be seen.  All ages and is a movie that anyone who sees it for the first time must be excited and follow the movie from the search for information to a movie made from a personal novel. I didn't read a novel before watching the movie.  But saw people who read the movie say that the content in the novel is more diverse and more detailed in the movie and in the movie has changed a lot of chapters  But if watching a movie and going to read a novel, it might change the perspective of watching movies in another way.\n\n The plot of the movie is based on the story of a character named Harry Potter who lost his parents as a child without knowing the real reason and was raised by his biological aunt.  which the feasting is not good at all  His aunt raised him like he was a servant.  and when he reached the criteria that he had to study  The magic school had sent him a letter to attend as a preparation.  His parents actually said that his parents had died by being killed and had taken Harry to go shopping for school.  And studied at the magic school for the first time, got to know the friendship that he had accidentally encountered and learned through both the good and the bad side together as this friendship is like the only family that Harry  There is in life, no matter how the story is, his friends will help and take care of each other. It is considered a movie that represents very good friendship.  And saw the development of Harry trained to use in the fight against the people who killed his parents.  The story of Harry potter is a very interesting movie, if anyone has not seen this movie, it is a missed opportunity.\n\n In summary, from looking at and searching for information and seeing different opinions that  This movie is considered a very popular movie, most of them have to watch and are movies that can be accessed by all ages, with interesting content, worth watching and may  Getting the content from watching this movie. Overall, this movie is a magic movie, making people interested and is a realistic movie and may be different from other movies and the scripts have changed to the novel.

Robbie Coltrane is the best actor in the film with a great deal of charm more than anyone. The cinematography is very well done with very elaborate sets and well shot scenes. the only thing is the CGI at times doesn't look as good as the rest of the practical sets most of the time. The music is very well done also. The only real major knocks to this film are the editing & pacing which while still are solid, have a bit too many ideas. The film feels like the first half is about Harry & his friends adjusting to school while the second half is about the mystery of the stone. This is fine but the problem is it starts to drag and feels bloated. It feels like its being too faithful to the novel while sacrificing focus. Some scenes like the flying game, going into the restricted section could have been cut and nothing would be lost. Although there well done scenes. Also the first half with them adjusting to school feels like the scenes don't put together don't have a logical flow although there still well done. Also its worth noting most of this film has a very childish feel to it while the final act does go on the dark side and get more intense which I enjoyed. In conclusion despite some unremarkable child acting, bloated run time and unfocused narrative at times this is a solid film that holds up well. Definitely worth a watch for any fan of the franchise and worth viewing to get to the others.",

Por\u00e9m, eles souberam trabalhar bem com a trilha sonora, o humor, a tem\u00e1tica de auto descoberta e amizade do trio na aventura pela Pedra Filosofal, principalmente da metade do filme para frente. Portanto, apesar de muita coisa n\u00e3o convencer, ele acerta em alguns momentos, no entanto, n\u00e3o passa nas regras dos 15 anos, pois ele \u00e9 um filme que dificilmente voc\u00ea conseguiria assistir novamente e \u00e9 melhor ficar com a nostalgia.",

As an adult, I thought it had many interesting concepts and believable young and flawed characters without being too immature or annoying, but the film was held back by a lack of depth and any real stakes to draw me in very far. Everything seemed to go the protagonists' way after a point.\n\n\nFor example, Hogwarts has a magical, broom-flying sports game with a set of rules and goals that can all be negated and ignored by catching the golden snitch. Furthermore, the wizards in charge of the school arbitrarily assigning points to its students felt a bit too convenient at times, particularly near the end. If I were in Slytherin, I would be protesting Dumbledore's clear favoritism toward Gryffindor, and I hope this comes to pass considering House Slytherin is meant to represent ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness.\n\n\"But this is a movie about wizards, so the rules don't need to make sense!\" is a type of argument I hear repeated with similar stories that hold no weight with me. Magic can be explained in this universe as a natural force, so I can buy the mystique of its unknown power. But giving the protagonists constant wins from nonsensical rules is lazy world-building.\n\nTo the film's credit, unique stories were told in how the wizards (mostly Harry) interacted with the magical school of Hogwarts. This setting lends itself to interesting interactions that I wouldn't often see in other media: a child responding to his deepest desires manifested in a magical mirror or how a group of kids will react to a trap that activates based on your physical struggle against it, for example. \n\n\nMy favorite part of this movie is found in the potential stories created by the setting. While the first movie failed to live up to the full potential of the school, I hope the next few movies delve deeper into more than just classic magical battles and sports games such as exploring the various students and houses, including more of these students in the story, and not having every story conveniently end with everything coming together to the benefit of the main characters. Part of what makes Harry an intriguing character is his calm and brave demeanor despite a life of tragedy. But because the other characters didn't have an obvious deeper struggle in their backstory or their school lives, it was difficult to emphasize with them.",

The movie is correctly titled Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nI will start with where the movie lets itself down - and that is in the train ride to Hogwarts. The timing is all over the place. The train seems like it has gone for an absolute age before Ron decides that everywhere else is full. Then Hermione declares that the train is nearly there, while it is still broad daylight and it arrives in the pitch dark. \n\nNear the end of the film in the chess scene, why did Ron need to be riding the chess piece? That made no sense.\n\nNow - the good bits. The overall storyline is great - yes it is simplistic, but it is based on a children's book, so that is to be expected. The dialogue has some great moments, particularly where Ron and Hermione and concerned. The cinematography is excellent too, with great use of colour. The score by John Williams is excellent - one of his best (aren't they all, though?) and evokes the magic that matches the film.\n\nAll in all, great for 2 and half hours of light, escapist entertainment.",

With the first book coming out when I was three years old and the first movie when I was seven, there is a special place in my heart for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.\n\nI know that it is not the most remarkable piece of art when looking at it from a filmmaking perspective. However, let us remember that this movie was made for children. When it comes to world-building and enveloping the audience, I would argue that this movie goes toe to toe with Lord of the Rings and some of the other greats.\n\nWhat Chris Columbus and company did is nothing short of game-changing. They took excellent source material, stayed true to the book and built upon it. The visuals, specifically involving Hogwarts, are gorgeous. The score by John Williams is one of the most recognizable of all time. The characters are instantly likeable (or despicable). There is honestly so much to praise and love about this movie.\n\nWhile not every scene is necessary to the plot, those \"pointless\" scenes further add to the feeling of magic. From sitting in Flitwick's classroom to ruminating on a windowsill with an owl, I could watch footage of Hogwarts on repeat. This is a movie that I could turn on at any time and jump right into the story. Simply put, I instantly have a warm feeling which stays with me the whole way through.\n\nWhile the acting and dialogue have some rough moments, particularly with the younger actors, the casting is excellent. From Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane to Richard Harris and Maggie Smith, there is not a single dud when it comes to the adult cast. The students are also perfectly cast, with the main trio's chemistry on full display.\n\nAt the end of the day I'll say it again, I know that this is not a perfect film, but it is a magical film. The movie is highly rewatchable, endlessly quotable and enchantingly enjoyable. When defining \"comfort film\", this movie is at the top of the list. Simply put, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone set the stage for one of the most popular movie franchises of all time and one of the most impactful parts of my childhood.\n\nBest Character: Rubeus Hagrid\nBest Moment: Arriving to Hogwarts on the boats.\nBest Quote: \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.\" - Albus Dumbledore\n\nAdditional Note: Having the house cup ripped from Slytherin is why I have issues with premature celebration. That being said, the whole sequence is still chill-inducing.",

The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) does a great job of easing the viewer into this world, setting the foundations for the franchise to build off of, however in doing so it does skip over a few bits which would be tightened up in the later films when it adapts a more serious tone, however there is no denying the amount of fun this film produces as well as the importance for the franchise it built.\n\nThe trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are so enjoyable to watch and lead the story, it is so impressive how strong of leads they are given their age, obviously with child actors there are a few nitpick inconsistencies but nothing too bothering.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) birthed a mega-franchise which created many childhoods as well as opening up peoples mind to more creative fantasies thanks to the sheer amount of detail executed in this movie.",

Throughout my life - school days, college, internet; I often used to see people going non-stop about Harry Potter (I think they are called Potterheads). Harry Potter this, Harry Potter that. So finally yesterday I decided to give it a try and oh my god, it's amazing! Why didn't I see it back when I had the chance to?\nIt is kinda unbelieveable that such a nicely detailed CGI movie was released in 2001. I know the VFX had grown a lot better since Lord of the Rings trilogy was also made at the same time, but still I was not prepared for it. I was expecting it to be just some regular CGI that didn't age too well. Trust me, if you haven't watched the movie till now, it hasn't aged at all. It can very much still be the selling point of the movie.\nI had watched some parts of the movie, like the beginning where Harry's cousin was brought back home after he fell in the snake's cage and the Quidditch scene, but I didn't have any powerful memory of any other scene from the movie. In the scene where Voldemort says to the professor, \"Kill him!\" somehow I used to remember that scene to be the teacher first saying \"What should I do?\" to which Voldemort replies that. And I'm glad I didn't have any previous memory of this movie, because that way I was able to experience everything for the first time.\nThis movie has the 2001 movie's vibe to it, where the story is very straightforward and the childish background music makes it seem very easy to understand. I haven't seen any other movie of the franchise, as I'm going to watch the next part after writing this review. But I hope it stays that way, since it's very easy to understand and thus I can watch the movie on my phone while doing my work on my laptop.",

But with the fact that it was one of the first movies in that era that was a story about the magic world It made me, both childhood and now, that even though I was able to guess the events of the story, the movie was able to find a point where we were very excited, entertained, and passionate about this magical adventure. this magical world It is an amazing movie for me.

The did such a tremendous job that the actual plot points for foiling Voldemort were handled at an absolute sprint - they spent perhaps 90 seconds dealing with the Devil's Snare, for example. It wouldn't have been reasonable to ask for a longer movie than this as it was already clocking in at 2.5 hours, and thus the job they did juggling tons of exposition with an exciting plot was beyond reproach. The child actors did a wonderful job and it seems like sheer luck that they grew up to be attractive, talented young adults as the series progressed. Hedwig's Theme from Williams's score is my favorite piece of film music of all time and it wasn't even remotely overbearing at any point. Endlessly rewatchable. Kudos!",

I have watched the movies in the past, and decided to rewatch the series for old times sake. The sorcerers stone is a solid opener to the series. It does a great job at establishing the world, the characters, etc. It is just a fun, mostly happy childhood movie that creates that emoptional connection between viewer and the universe. If you are watching this series for the first time, you will love this movie. However, as someone who has seen these films before and knows the ins and outs of the universe, this first movie is a bit slow at times; struggling from pacing issues.

            "content": "There's nothing like the first\nThere's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\nI'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the \"magical\" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.\n\nWelcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!\n\nUsually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as \"guest stars\" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word \"earwax\" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as \"Maggie Smith cats\", mumble \"Shouldn't have said that,\" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?\n\nFirst movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.\n\nEach installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name \"Fluffy,\" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie",

The film gorgeously directed by Chris Columbus of Home Alone fame boasts an incredible cast of veteran British thespians including Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, the late Alan Rickman, and John Hurt. But this movie would not work without the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione played respectively by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Here at the beginning of their careers as children they carry this movie from beginning to end and their chemistry makes for one of the most memorable trios in cinema. The script manages to tell the story in a reasonable amount of time given the amount of set up. The special effects are really an incredible achievement and transports us into a fantasy world that feels grounded. The creatures, props, and sets bring Harry's world to life in a way never before seen in movies. Finally, the score by the legend John Williams is perhaps one of the most beautiful and joyful scores ever and has reached iconic status. This film is a masterpiece filled with imagination and wonder that left an entire generation including me in love with Harry Potter",

Recently my niece asked me about them, and when she discovered that I had stopped part way through the film universe asked me to watch them with her. This will be my second viewing of the first four movies though nearly two decades have passed since I last saw the Philosopher's Stone (I refuse to recognize the bastardized title). It will be my first time experiencing the final four pictures.\n\nThe opening sequences of the Philosopher's Stone were charming albeit in a disturbing fashion. The abuse young Harry suffers at the hands of the Dursley's feels bizarre when viewed through a PG prism. Though the creative team does a great job bringing Rowling's magical world to life, which kind of sadly quickly takes your mind off the darker elements. Outside of Radcliff the cast does an incredible job embodying these iconic characters\n\nWhile I don't think I'll ever be able to separate the films from their incredible counterparts, I did myself a disservice all those years ago.

Knowing Chris Columbus from Home Alone, I was a little skeptical going into this film, but he put his intuitive style all over it, shooting a real dazzling looking film.\n\nThe overall concept of the film is outrageously original, filled with tremendous potential and heart, with many memorable scenes! The premise of the film is where the issues come in. The premise is fine, and good kickstart for this favorable series, but it wasn't focused, or fleshed out nearly enough; All the creative team cared about was setting up all this exposition. The exposition is fine to a certain extent, but when seventy percent of the film is exposition, with another fifteen percent being some fan service-filler scenes, it makes it hard to get invested into what's going on, at this point in time. If the creative team cut out most of their filler scenes, they could've tightened up the narrative more, while giving the film an easier run time to digest. The film had a pretty decent pace for more than sixty percent of the film, but the middle act became more of a slowburn pace, creating a few unnecessary plots, that just got left to die.\n\nI give so much credit to these casting directors, for casting this star-studded cast! With this film being filled with a lot of characters, the creative team did a good job of balancing everyone, crafting countless memorable character moments, while giving them some nice layers to start to develop. It's no secret to say that the three main wizards in, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, are the selling point to this film! Almost automatically, they're given phenomenal chemistry, and banter to play around with. They have this pure motivation, that make them really investable, and easy to root for. Although some of the supporting characters can go underdeveloped, they were still a huge asset to the film, and they all came to play ball!\n\nThe screenplay by Steve Kloves was pretty well written overall, besides some of the parts and characters that went underdeveloped. He adapted this nice mythical speech style, that worked really well with the setting and plot! The comedy was really well balanced, and interwoven into this, sometimes darker toned film. Steve Kloves worked really well with J.K. Rowling to craft this script, and they made more than a handful of memorable quotes, that will just stick aroun with you forever!\n\nThe creative team created tremendous potential with a new world, that opens doors to endless opportunities! The production design looks absolutely beautiful! The creative team utilized so many great set pieces, while having so many great practical costumes and makeup to go along with this amazing world.\n\nIt's understandable that the magic isn't all there yet, but I would've liked a little more, with some conflict, to give the film more risks. Columbus had the perfect opportunity to add a lot of stakes, because of the kids inexperience, but the creative team didn't quite jump on it. One of the bigger issues of the film, is the effects. They weren't terrible at the time, but they don't hold up that well, and the creative team carried themselves like they created seamless work.\n\nThe score is one of the biggest success this film has. John Williams is a master composer, and he easily crafted one of the most known scores in cinema! The score adds so much depth and intensity to every scene that it's in!\n\nOverall, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will always have a special place in my heart, but it has room for improvement.",

            "content": "This first film in the blockbuster franchise was one of my favorite films growing up, but does it hold up in 2020, or is it blind nostalgia? I'd say it mostly holds up but there are things that I didn't notice when I was younger, it has its issues so let's dissect this film a little bit. Chris Columbus makes such a fun and believable world that you desperately want it to be real, magic is seen as an amazing wonder in this movie and you are pleasantly surprised by it as you discover this whole magical world for the first time with Harry Potter. John Williams' score goes without saying, it is very magical, not just because it makes you truly feel the magic people are using, but because it is so fitting and emotional, he is the greatest cinematic composer of all time and this is one of his absolute best scores. The casting and performances were all perfect, the young leads surprised me and I cared about them, but Alan Rickman as Snape was amazing, I love his character and his presence just makes you feel depressed, this was by far his best role, narrowly beating Hans Gruber. I always enjoy the Dursleys, no matter how cruel they are to Harry, and Richard Griffiths is the most underrated actor in the series. The production design and practical effects are top-notch in quality and it helps make you feel like this world exists with these creatures and the beautiful Hogwarts castle. This film is not without issues though as I have several that I noticed upon rewatch. This film is long and slow, it is drawn out because this needs to do a substantial amount of world-building and it is also an origin story for all three of our leads; I understand why they did this, but they could've taken out maybe ten minutes, or at least replaced it with more plot development, this film definitely drags at times and not a lot of time is devoted to the overall plot or the antagonist of this movie. I did not care about Quirrell at all and thought that he was a wasted character who should've been more important considering he was the main villain, not a lot of time was given to the actual sorcerers stone either, we didn't get to fully understand why it was such a coveted item and it feels more like a half baked sub-plot. The camera at times gives some weird angles and tracking shots which I've never noticed before. The full-body CGI is very noticeable and terrible, especially when compared to the amazing practical effects. Back to the positives though, I really enjoyed the Forbidden Forest sequence, it was dark dreary in tone which was refreshing from this happy go lucky, magic is awesome tone that is present in the rest of the film. Quidditch is by far my favorite thing in the wizarding world and the match in this movie is so exciting and viceral, you really wish that it was real and that you could see the amazing sport in real life. This film was a pretty good start to this epic franchise, though most of its problems have to do with pacing, bad CGI, a weak antagonist, and a main plot that was sidelined during the first half of the film and rushed through in the second half. The great acting from everyone, a decent script, Columbus' sure direction, and great makeup and production design paired along with great performances from our young leads and memorable side characters make this a pretty good movie and a solid start to the franchise.",

After his parents are killed, he has to move in with his aunt and uncle who hate him. They treat him terribly just because the aunt didn't like his sister for one specific reason. This reason is that Harry's parents are both wizards, meaning that they can use magic and spells and other magical things. A man named Hagrid comes to get Harry so that he can attend Hogwarts, the school of witchcraft and wizardry. This is when Harry finds out that he is a wizard and that there is a normal world and a wizarding world. Harry then attends this school and meets friends and they all have to figure out the mystery behind the sorcerer's stone. \n\tI am someone who is very into the Harry Potter series. This movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an excellent movie. It puts mystery, adventure, and fun all into one film. I enjoy how the movie explains the characters backgrounds well. It makes it more interesting that we know that Harry's parents were killed and how they were killed. It also makes the plot more interesting that Harry's aunt and uncle hate him so much and that they keep him being a wizard a secret from him because they don't want him to end up like his aunt's sister, his mom. This brings up another factor of this movie that I appreciate, the character development.\n\tThroughout the movie, we learn a lot about all of the different characters. We learn about Harry's best friend, Ron Weasley's background. About how he has a huge family, goes to Hogwarts, and is also kind of squeamish, but also brave. We also learn about Harry's enemy, Draco Malfoy. Draco is a very mean and hostile boy that also goes to Hogwarts. He tries to make Harry's life adjustment as bad as he possibly can. This balance of people that are good to Harry and bad to him are what makes the film and its plot more interesting for the viewers, like me, to watch. \n\tAnother reason to enjoy this movie is because of its setting. The movie starts out in the normal human world. I think this was important to include because it shows how much adjusting Harry Potter had to do when he went to the wizarding world. When he was introduced to the wizarding world you could tell that he was a little overwhelmed in the beginning, but as time went on it became his new home. I think that putting Harry in a wizarding school was a great choice to do. This way, Harry would be forced to learn how to use his wizarding abilities and have to interact with other wizards his age. This all makes the plot amusing and leaves the viewers wanting to keep watching. All in all, I think that this movie has many good features to it which makes me recommend others to watch.",

Actors like Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and Maggie Smith portrays the characters brilliantly and it adapts the book so well. Every character and location is exactly how I describe it and there are so many great moments like the entire 3rd act, the Quidditch match, the Mirror of Erised scene, our first look at Hogwarts and many more. Chris Columbus put so much passion into this movie. I laughed, I cried, I was scared, it's everything I wanted and it exceeds the already excellent book. The child acting and CGI is not the best however and since the first book is my personal least favorite one, it also has to suffer from not the best source material but this movie will always hold a specual place in my heart (A-)",

            "content": "A charming introduction to the wizarding world of Harry Potter!\n\nChris Columbus' children's fantasy adventure film Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) is a dreamy fantasy picture that will make you want to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I loved growing up with these movies as a child, now as an adult, I appreciate their delightful filmmaking and storytelling all the more. Richard Francis-Bruce edits this movie with such a natural pace that time flies by with a new quaint scenario of magic every scene. Columbus set a new standard for family entertainment by creating all this cinematic iconography with his greatest film: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. It is pure joy for 152 magical minutes of childhood nostalgia.\n\nJ. K. Rowling's writing is like stepping into the magical fantasy world of wizards and witches that we all dreamed of casting spells and going to far away places. She understands the perspective of children desiring more from life, whether she writes about family, friends, love, adventure, travel, or courage in the face of adversity. Rowling invented an entire magical universe all her own that I'm forever grateful for her mind. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a delightful family movie that remains a personal favorite of mine to this day.\n\nHarry Potter famously found the most talented child actors around with natural performances, nice chemistry, and genuinely heartfelt emotions. Daniel Radcliffe is incredibly sympathetic and likable as the eager, yet shy Harry Potter. Rupert Grint is hilarious as the endearing poor fool Ron Weasley. Emma Watson was born to play Hermione Granger with her quick wits and adorable charm. She plays Hermione more smug initially until she warms up to the boys and their adventurous spirit. Tom Felton is perfectly cast as the villainous bully Draco Malfoy. His name even means bad guy, so you know Felton had this in the bag with his smug face and elitist attitude as Draco. He lets you know Malfoy is wealthy and comes from a long line of money and isn't afraid to cheat his way to the top. He's a phenomenally hateable antagonist and memorable character.\n\nRichard Harris is so kind and gentle as the formidable wizard headmaster Albus Dumbledore in all his flowing robes and magnificent beard. He sounds so soothing and knowledgeable that I think Harris' serene and kindly Dumbledore is my favorite incarnation of J. K. Rowling's iconic wizard character. Maggie Smith is gleefully stern as the brilliant witch Minerva McGonagall. Harry Potter is simply her best acting. Robbie Coltrane is hilarious and sweet as the lovable giant Rubeus Hagrid. Alan Rickman is phenomenal as Severus Snape with his wicked wit and morbidly serious tone. Rickman is so fun as Professor Snape because of the look of disdain he puts on so well. Richard Griffiths is very fun as Harry Potter's mean uncle Vernon Dursley alongside Fiona Shaw's wicked Aunt Petunia Dursley. Ian Hart is interesting as the timid and stuttering Professor Quirrell.\n\nI must mention the legendary actor Sir John Hurt cameos as the nice wand merchant Garrick Ollivander in the most mystifying scene in Harry Potter when Harry chooses his wand. Hurt captures an air of mystery and warmth that you will believe in magic!\n\nOther excellent supporting roles of note are David Bradley as the sadistic groundskeeper Mr. Filch with his cute cat Mrs. Norris. Matthew Lewis as the cowardly Neville Longbottom. Warwick Davis as the bank teller goblin and Filius Flitwick. Verne Troyer as Griphook is scary and neat. Harry Melling is such a jerk as Dudley Dursley. John Cleese is funny as Nearly Headless Nick like Julie Walters is kind as Ron's mother Molly Weasley. You can even see a cute young Bonnie Wright as Ron's little sister Ginny Weasley at the train station!\n\nChris Columbus' charming direction is what makes Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone so charming. You want to visit these magical places in an enchanted English countryside as it all looks real. The production design is mysterious, dusty, warm, and quaintly inviting. The practical effects are mixed carefully with excellent for the era CGI, where a talking snake looks real as does many magic spells. The only green screen that's noticeable is the backgrounds while students fly on brooms and the troll. Even the sorting hat still looks cool.\n\nJudianna Makovsky and Graham Churchyard's costumes are already iconic from Dumbledore's robes, Snape's suit and cloak, to the Gryffindor scarves. Clare Le Vesconte's make-up is inspired with crazy choices for goblins and wizards alike. John Williams' score is so pleasant that you can never forget his theme songs for Harry Potter. He carefully composed each piece for each scene as the notes are cues for particular moments on screen for magical emphasis. He outdid himself with one of his most beloved and memorable scores within his illustrious career as a composer.\n\nColumbus brings his usual Christmas spirit and child's playful attitude alongside his resplendent directorial choices. The scary sequences are dark and mysterious, while various payoffs are cleverly established earlier up with clever framing and sequencing on his part. His swift and imaginative direction transcends time and age as he crafted a wonderful feature for all ages. John Seale's striking cinematography captures wide shots of Hogwarts castle, dark foggy forests, hidden chambers, and brightly lit halls with equal grace. Seale's close-ups are iconic and very expressive.\n\nIn conclusion, Chris Columbus directed a classic film with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone with his creative direction, Williams' legendary score, and a cool cast of talented kids.",

Se voc\u00ea leu o livro, sabe do que estou falando. A adapta\u00e7\u00e3o respeita a obra original e tenta ser fidedigna as possible. Inclusive, talvez esse seja o filme mais fiel de toda a franquia.\n\nA escolha dos atores foi certeira. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson e Rupert Grint formam um trio com uma boa qu\u00edmica que funciona. Fora o sotaque brit\u00e2nico que \u00e9 de apaixonar. Tamb\u00e9m vale a men\u00e7\u00e3o a Richard Harris, que apesar de n\u00e3o ser meu Dumbledore favorito, definitivamente \u00e9 o mais bem adaptado.\n\nEm quesitos t\u00e9cnicos o filme se torna balanceado. Aqui temos uma OST fant\u00e1stica, talvez uma das mais conhecidas do planeta terra - e n\u00e3o \u00e9 por menos. Al\u00e9m de emocionante, marca uma grande presen\u00e7a no filme, que definitivamente n\u00e3o seria o mesmo sem.

A dura\u00e7\u00e3o do filme foi muito bem escolhida- n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito longo a cansar e nem a ponto de se distanciar muito da obra original, mesmo que tenham cortado uma quantidade significativas de coisas do livro. Sendo assim, \u00e9 obvio que o universo/atmosfera n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o rica quanto a dos livros, mas isso alguma vez j\u00e1 foi poss\u00edvel?!",

Rowling and is the film is the first instalment of the Harry Potter film series.\nThis movie is so well done, and to me seems like it was ahead of its time. \nHarry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has lived under the stairs at his aunt and uncle's house his whole life. But on his 11th birthday, he learns he's a powerful wizard -- with a place waiting for him at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As he learns to harness his newfound powers with the help of the school's kindly headmaster (Richard Harris), Harry uncovers the truth about his parents' deaths -- and about the villain who's to blame.\nI would say that the casting of the film is perfect. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. They steal your heart and every scene they are in. Also, the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane make their characters likable.\nSometimes the visuals are better than others, but it was good for being made in 2001. The film has a big runtime, but the script is so tight it feels like it blows by.\nOverall, anyone who loves fantasy films and worlds with great visuals, this film is for you. I go back to this movie all the time, and I highly recommend it.\n4.5/5",

The film was directed by Chris Columbus who also directed Home Alone. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley.\n\nThe acting is good for the most part, but a few of the children actors feel off a lot of the time. Daniel Radcliffe was fine, but he felt like he was phoning it in a lot of the time.\n\nThe characters I felt were strong and memorable, but in my opinion I think that Harry Potter is one of the most overrated and annoying characters from successful book/film history.\n\nThe cinematography was sound with some very good shots of the characters and scenery.\n\nThe settings of the film are quiet strong ranging from a train station to Hogwarts  the famous magical school.\n\nThe set design and props I thought were some of the best things within the film from the building designs to the various magical items. \n\nThe costume design and makeup was also strong especially with Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid and Richard Harris as Professor Albus Dumbledore.\n\nThe style of the film is sound from the colour scheme to the settings, but I felt that with the budget they could've made it more colourful.\n\nThe practical effects from the makeup to the stunts were done well, but the special effects I felt have aged really badly. Some times it would look fine, but at other times the CGI looks so laughably bad.\n\nThe film also had some action toward the end which I felt was pulled off quiet well.\n\nThe score of the film in my opinion is very strong and memorable. The other music was also good, but not as memorable.\n\nThe film also had some comedy which I felt wasn't bad but not good. I only laughed twice within the film and both moments involved Hagrid.\n\nI did have quiet a lot of complaints with the film from some of the rules to the film feeling slow and off at points.\n\nOne of the better things within the film was Hagrid. I felt that they used his size very well unlike some other movies with bigger characters. \n\nThe film I enjoyed, but I wouldn't say that I would watch it over most other movies.\n\nOver all I give it a \n5/10\n56%\n2.8/5\n\nMemorable, but disappointing",

The cast was excellently selected and I will always stand by that. The dialogue kept me interested, yet sometimes things were stated too obviously. The only part that did not reflect on the book well was the end where they left out a part of the test to get to the Sorcerer's Stone. The acting and plot was very well done overall.",

Harry Potter movies were directed by David Yates, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Chris Columbus and Mike Newell. As I said before, it's a fiction movie and one of the bests that have ever existed.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe stars on it as Harry Potter, the main character. He was 11 when he appeared on the first movie of this saga. He has been acting for 15 years since 2001. He is well known because of the saga's reputation. Also Emma Watson acted there as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. As Daniel, it was their first time acting in a movie so they don't have any movies before. In the movie they're Harry's best friends. I think their performances are good because they get really into their characters, even for being their first time acting. For example when they are having a sentimental moment, they got so into their own characters that it seems like it's their real life. This make that the movies can have a really impressing emotional effect.\n\nThe plot is about Harry Potter, who was an orphan kid that lived with his uncle when receives a letter inviting him to a wizard school called Hogwarts. There, he meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, that become his best friends share lots of dangerous and interesting adventures and solving mysterious. I think it's a very interesting plot, because it's full of mysteries, suspense and obviously magic. But don't forget that as Harry grows up, the movies become darker and deeper.\n\nIt's films are set at the Cambridge University, that seems magic with lots of special effects done with computers and camera changes. These special effects, doesn't only make this school seem like from a fantasy book, it also makes that the magic wands, dragons, objects, spellings and wizards come alive. It's soundtrack is good. It was composed by John Williams, who helps you to introduce completely in this mysterious magic world. Well, my favourite scene, occurs at the last movie they've released and it's when Harry fights against his arch enemy, Lord Voldemort. They have a magic fight with magical animals and their respecting wands. Also it has got many emotional effects, as Harry's solved mystery from his parents deaths and friendship is present all the time at the movie.\n\nI think most fans will be happy with the ending of this interesting saga. And people who haven't seen it before, should do it because it introduces to a fantasy world on which you can do whatever you want always trusting on your friends, and being yourself. When you get plugged with the first movie, then you won't stop until finish. One of the lots of the messages of the movies is that friendship is the base to beat all enemies such as hate. I give it a ten out of ten. (10/10)",

After watching Sorcerer's Stone throughout the years, time and time again, I can confidently say that it is the weakest of all the Potter films. Well, it's a close call between this and Deathly Hallows Part 1. Nonetheless, it's still a somewhat entertaining flick, that at the very least, sets the stage nicely as a grand introduction to a beloved franchise. (4/5)",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy movie released in 2001 and directed by Chris Colombus. It's based on a J.K Rowling's book. There are 7 books in this saga and they all tell us the story of Harry Potter, the wizard. This caracter is played by Daniel Radcliffe who is now know for his representation in the movie. On the movie but also on the books, Harry Potter is friend with two others caracters : Ronald Weasley (played by Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (acted by Emma Watson).\nEven if it's a fantasy movie, this one is adaptedto children and adults : the magical aspect that we find again on the next 7 movies is here very marked. We discover an all new world on whitch one sorcerers and fantastic beasts are existing. But there is also danger and it's interesting for older public.\n\n   The story takes place in England, in the Hogwarts school. Harry Potter is an ordinary eleven years olded boy raised by his uncles : the Dursley. He hates them and his parents died since he was born. Harry discovers one day he is a sorcerer and he musts go at Hogwarts school, a school for people like him. On the sorcerer's world Harry is actually a famous person because he is the only one who faced and survive to the black wizard, Voldemort. He is now caught up by is past and must face it with the help of his friends Hermione and Ron.\n\n   On this film and on all the others, Daniel Radcliffe portrays very well the caracter of Harry Potter. First of all, he looks like him. Then he knows how to convey the main caracter's life. Even if he is supposed to be an Young boy, he brings a childlike aspect to the caracter but also a brave one. Harry Potter thanksto Daniel Radcliffe, is oblivious and curious at the same time.\n   As for Emma Watson, I think she is the best actor in this trio. She played perfectly the unbearable and haughty personality Hermione has. We can say she is smart as Hermione Granger.\n   Of course, Rupert Grint conveys very well too to the life of Ronald Weasley. he brings us something that make Ronald funny and fearful.\n   Finally our three actors grew up with the movie caracter's and it makes them believable.\n\n   Warner Bros had a budgect of 125 000 000 $. With an amount that bigger we expect a lot of techniques and special effects. Chris Colombus fulfill our expectations. First with the soundtrack. The soundtrack is always here to convey with the caracter's feeling or to let the viewers know tht there is a danger. For example the music change to be a light and joyfull one on happy moments. and when the rythm goes faster we know something mportat is going to happen. Afterwards, we notice a lot of littles techniques on the way they shot the hots to make them more believable. For example, when Harry speek to Hagrid (a half-giant) we see him by low angle shot (18'39min). It makes the caracter bigger. Then there is a panoramic view of Hogwarts school at 38'48 minutes to shows us the school is huge and wonderful. In addition the costumes are very important on this movie because they create the magical aspect of this world (floating candles, uniforms...). To end the special effects make the movie a blockbuster (ghost, troll...).\n\n   We can say that Hary Potter and the Philosopher's stone is a great film which respect very well the book with the same name. And even if the book is better than the movie, the movie is convincing and take us into a beautiful new world.\n\n  You better see it, after all it's the best sorcerers movie ever in this cinematographic world.\nHope you enjoyed, bye ;)",

I couldn't think of anyone else in these roles after the credits rolled. Columbus' direction is also excellent; painting a picture of contrasting lights and shadows that clash to create a warm and welcoming picture quality. \nThis is a film that continues to stay in my memory long after it is over because it excels at creating a believable fantasy world and characters.

The sets look absolutely fantastic, some of the best in a fantasy film. You feel like the backgrounds are coming to life, mostly because, they often are. The effects have held up really well. Nothing exceptional by todays standards, but still very admirable. The acting from the kids is easy to criticise, but does give it a certain childish charm, and you can tell how hard they're trying. Add on top of that the fact that the central trio are perfectly cast and all have their memorable moments, and you can't be too upset by their frequently stilted deliveries. The main problem is it's adherence to the novel, which feels very rigid and workmanlike, leaving little room for spontaneity, and makes it feel like more of a series of set events than a fully fluid experience. But with that said the film has so much likability and creativity that's its managed to endure for over a decade and holds a very special place in our culture. It's sense of wonderment, discovery and exploration are sure to sweep you away.",

Rowling is this 2001 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone', directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Nine Months). Get taken away to a wonderful world of sorcery, where an unlikely hero gets confronted with a great evil. Filled with magical characters, amazing effects and above all a very powerful storyline, this movie hits the spot. Perfect for all ages. Starring Daniel Radcliffe (The Woman in Black), Emma Watson (Noah), Rupert Grint (Into the White), Tom Felton (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Robby Coltrane (From Hell), Maggie Smith (Death on the Nile), Richard Harris (Gladiator), Warwick Davis (Willow) and Alan Rickman (Die Hard), and guest stars John Hurt (Alien), Julie Walters (Calander Girls) and John Cleese (Monty Python saga). \n\nHarry Potter (Radcliffe) lives in the closet underneath the stairs in the house of his relatives, the Dursley family. On his 11th birthday, Harry learns from a half-giant called Rubeus Hagrid (Coltrane) that his parents were famous wizards who were killed by Voldemort, an evil sorcerer. He was a baby when it happened and miraculously survived.  Hagrid invites the boy to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Together they travel to London, where they buy the necessary school supplies in a secret wizarding street, called Diagon Alley. \n\nOn the Hogwarts Express, Harry meets Ron Weasley (Grint) who comes from a large but poor wizard family, the intelligent Hermione Granger (Watson), whose parents are non-magical and the intolerable pure-blood Draco Malfoy (Felton). Arriving at school, all first year students are welcomed by professor Minerva McGonagall (Smith) and led to the great hall, where they get sorted by a hat into one of the four houses. Harry joins Ron and Hermione in the house of Gryffindor. After the warning of the school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Harris) to stay away from the Forbidden Corridor on the Third Floor, Harry notices one of the teachers, Severus Snape (Rickman), staring at him. \n\nLater that year, Harry, Ron and Hermione stumble upon the Forbidden Floor where they have an encounter with a three-headed dog, that seems to be guarding a hatch...",

It was a bit of a tough watch for me, as I had just finished the book series before watching this film, and there are so many details lost in the translation from book to film.  I knew there would be, because there is just too much in the books to jam into a reasonably paced and standard length film.  Even still, I though that the film still had to rush in places, particularly in the first 30 minutes.  This rushed pace kind of took me out of the film  I was also not prepared for some of special effects to be what they were.  There are some scenes that are just to heavy in lower-quality CGI, and that also took me out of the story.  However, despite these flaws, I thought the had a very good cast.  The child actors are all quite good, and I especially enjoyed Emma Watson's Hermione in this film (because she kind of reminded me of my niece with her appearance and attitude!).  I also enjoyed Hagrid's portrayal, which was a little less foolish than in the books, so far.  I'm divided on Dumbledore's portrayal, as I thought he had the right look, but the voice is not what I had always had in my head.  All in all, it is a pretty good film, especially if you are a fan of the book series.",

If I was given \u00a310 to spend on a book I would automatically head for the horror, sci-fi or thriller sections so the fact that Harry Potter is fantasy just shows how amazing the books are!\n\nThe first book is Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The story starts with Number 4 Privet Drive about a boy called Harry Potter who lives in the cupboard under the stairs of a house owned by Mr and Mrs Dursley with their overly spoiled son called Dudley. In the fist quarter of the book it shows how Harry begins to receive letters which are addressed to him, in his cupboard and at the top of the letter a crest show the letters S,G,R AND H embellished with a snake, a griffin, an eagle and a badger. Even though this alone sounds mysterious Mr and Mrs Dursley don't allow him to read the letters and will go to any length to stop him. As the book progresses The Dursleys go away to a hut in the middle of the ocean to ensure no letters can arrive, but at midnight (before Harry's birthday) a giant of a man, later on to be recognised as Hagrid, bursts in and tells Harry he's a wizard! Hagrid also tells Harry how he came to live at Privet Drive as his parents were murdered by the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort. He also gives Harry the letter he had been hoping for for weeks it includes a letter to say that Harry will be attending Hogwarts school for Witchcraft and Wizardry and a list of essentials for his year ahead.\n\n\nSign up for Bookmarks: discover new books our weekly email\n Read more\nHagrid also informs Harry that he will have to catch the Hogwarts express which is located at King's Cross at platform 9 and 3/4. When arriving at King's Cross Harry soon realises that there is no platform 9 and 3/4, or at least that is visible. Then Harry meets what is going to be his second family, The Weasleys with 7 children, the youngest boy being Ronald Weasley who will soon become Harry's best friend for life. When they arrive at Hogwarts the first years wait to be sorted by the sorting hat. Harry and Ron are both placed in Griffindor to the delight of the other Weasley children currently attending Hogwarts. (The other houses are Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.)\n\nAs the year goes on at Hogwarts Harry and Ron attain a new best friend for life by the name of Hermione Granger and to the end of the year they have to all three face a battle against the dark Lord!\nThe film has inspired me to learn magic. The film also has many suspensory parts and makes me interested in learning magic. Hermione is very beautiful and she is an excellent student at Hogwart School. Harry Potter has two close friends, Hermione and Harry Potter has been patient as long as he was with his uncle's family because he was often beaten by them.

On his 11th birthday, Harry receives a mysterious letter, but his uncle destroys it before he can read it. Letters keep coming, and the Dursleys panic and hide away on a remote island. But they're found by Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), a huge, bearded man with a weakness for scary-looking creatures. It turns out that the letters were coming from Hogwarts, a boarding school for young witches and wizards, and Harry is expected for the fall term, so Hagrid whisks him off to begin his new life as a wizard in training. On the train to Hogwarts, Harry meets his future best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). When school begins, things really get exciting, with classes in Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts, a sport called Quidditch (a sort of flying soccer/basketball), a mysterious trap door guarded by a three-headed dog named Fluffy, and a baby dragon named Norbert.

            "content": "Strengths: When adapting a book to a film, keeping the essence of the source material is crucial. Chris Columbus and company succeeded there with the first Harry Potter film. He was a great choice for the early movies, as he nailed the more light hearted feel of these installments. It's quite the enchanting start and all the characters are given great introductions. You feel for Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), laugh at Ron (Rupert Grint), get annoyed but charmed by Hermione (Emma Watson) and are the perfect blend of suspicious and intrigued by Snape (Alan Rickman). By the way, Rickman and Maggie Smith (McGonagall) were seemingly born to play their respective roles. John Williams does a great job with the score, as well. The wizard chess scene, time in front of the mirror, and trek through Diagon Alley were all standout scenes. I also really liked how attention was paid to giving us a look at various aspects of Hogwarts and Qudditch.\n\nWeaknesses: Though a few things look great, some of the effects weren't up to expectations for a movie with this kind of budget. The scene with the keys near the end looks particularly rough. As was some of Harry's time in the Quidditch game. The stakes also probably weren't high enough in the trials the kids faced. They beat the devil's snare and key room with relative ease. Some of that is on JK Rowling, but more tension could've been added to the film version. Instead, it all felt too easy. Though I appreciated the look at the magical world, some of it could've been cut to make it so the movie didn't last as long as it did. Towards the end, there was a sense of it dragging on.  \n\nOverall: Better than Chamber of Secrets to me, though behind the rest of the films in the series. It works as a way to setup this massive universe and does well in aiming towards children. There are issues with effects, the length and some of the conflict near the end, but this was a satisfying first installment. It's wonderfully faithful to the source material and has a heart of gold.",

            "content": "I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking. The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with. The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story. Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.\n\nMany kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become: a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves. There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes. I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed. He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on. The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.\n\nOne of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence. By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace. The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence. I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life. The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film. The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another. My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages. Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure.I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like \"The Phantom Menace,\" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was \"How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?\" rather than \"How entertaining is this film overall?\" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.\n\nCritics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Mary Poppins,\" are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.\n\nAs a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, \"Adventures in Babysitting\"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.\n\nI had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like \"Home Alone\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.\n\nBut much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--\"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers\"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.\n\nNot that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.\n\nThe problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary \"muggle\" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.\n\nAlthough the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.\n\nThe answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.\n\nWhat we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.",

Harry is offered a place at prestigious Hogwarts, a boarding school for wizards that exists in a realm of magic and fantasy outside the dreary existence of normal humans or \"Muggles.\"\n\nBefore heading off for a life in another state shortly, I pushed myself to rewatch a series of films that I had been dying to see since my childhood. But I had been pushing it off in fear that the first couple of films would be really dated. Finally, I decided to put the first film into my Xbox. By my surprise, this film held up really well, and the Blu-Ray rendition actually looked really good. And I'll be honest, I had fun seeing the roots of our heroes, and I can't wait to watch them grow up through the next seven films and join their adventures. \n\nSo to start out, the beloved \"Harry Potter\" cast all give fine performances as young children. Daniel Radcliffe was a great lead and held a solid performance as a young child. Rupert Grint did a great job as the geeky, goofy, yet supportive best friend. Emma Watson was also fine, even if her character came off as that annoying, know-it-all friend that we've all met. Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid was also introduced as this lovable giant who will definitely be a fan favorite for years to come. It was really interesting to see the cast at a young age, especially knowing how far they would go. \n\nThe visuals and cinematography certainly wasn't as bad or dated as I expected it to be. Granted, some parts and moments definitely looked like something you'd see from the early 2000's but for the most part, this is a film that still holds up decently today. That was a real nice attribute that this film had and it really made the whole experience better for me.\n\nIn the end, this film really did feel more like a kids movie. I mean, it was made for the target audience of younger children, even if it was still entertaining for adults. There were some cheesy and goofy parts for sure, but it also was the beginning of a much more dark and deep story that's still going. Like I said, I still enjoyed this movie a lot and I had a lot more fun than I thought I would. Maybe it was the nostalgia of seeing it as a kid, or maybe it was the fun in seeing the beginning of things so iconic. Either way, this film was more than enjoyable. \n\nIn the end, I think this film holds up really well, and is a great start to a beloved franchise. I can't wait to see the rest of these films again and review them all soon. For now, I'm glad I finally rewatched this film so soon.",

Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.\n\nImagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.\n\nAnd have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.\n\nNow I know what you're going to say: \"But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!\" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?\n\nAvada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.\n\nImagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.\n\nI can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:\n\n\"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.\"\n\nAnd that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.",

As a film it delivers as a set up and as its own self contained adventure, besides some meandering in the second act and the speedy timeline, the Philosopher's Stone is almost a beat by beat adaption of the book, leaving out and tweaking one or two sequences for the sake of run time. It has aged a little but overall there is no doubt that this is solid film for all ages that is an essential watch for people who have not seen it. Also can't forget that John Williams' score is one the greatest ever.",

I really liked the actor who played Dumbledore in this first movie, R.I.P. I wish he could've kept playing him, but in return we got an amazing replacement. God, Dudley's such a spoiled little brat. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon did a wonderful job raising their kid, a wonderful job. I hate how they all treat Harry as if he's some child slave worker. Although I will say, the actor who plays Uncle Vernon is hilarious. He has such a great knack for comedy. \n\nI love how they stereotyped goblins as being the ones who run Gringotts Bank. Ironic since goblins are known for stealing things and for being greedy. The prosthetics for the goblins were so good. The set design pieces for Diagon Alley and Gringotts are also very impressive. Really great practical effects going on. I love how John Hurt plays Ollivander, it's perfect. Makes me love John Hurt and his acting even more than I already do. I love how Harry meets Ron for the first time when he's trying to find Platform 9 3/4. I'm glad Hermione chilled out over the years because she was pretty try hard as a kid. She was really cute and funny though. Emma was the perfect choice to play her. That shot of the boats with Hogwarts in the background is iconic. It's so magical lol. Very well choreographed shot. I love the way Dumbledore claps as the kids are getting sorted into their houses. He pats the top of his hand lol. \n\nI actually love Snape as a character. Talk about the underdog hero in the series. You can tell Alan Rickman gets comedy. Already off the bat you can tell Snape has a personal grudge towards Harry. I like Professor McGonagall. She's kind of like the stern but lovable and fair grandma. That life-size chessboard scene is so iconic. I love the design of the chess pieces. \n\nIt's definitely the most whimsical and kiddie movie out of all of them, which makes sense since Harry is at his youngest, but it's still great. There are a couple cheesy moments throughout, but it doesn't bother me as much. I was very taken back by how impressive the acting was. There were great performances all around from everyone, even the kids and especially the adults. The lighting and atmosphere in this movie is exquisite. I love that shot of Ollivander in the wand shop right after he says, \"I wonder\". There's so much rich atmosphere and ambience in that one shot. It's unforgettable. There's actually a lot of very well composed cinematography in this movie. The world building is some of the best in the fantasy genre. I do have to say though, some of the GCI looks dated as heck. But can you blame it? It came out in 2001. At the end of the day, Sorcerer's Stone is a really fun cozy good time. It's something I'd definitely watch again.",

I personalyl enjoy the films more starting with the third one because of the darker tone and overall feel of the films. This film and its sequel do however benefit from being much closer to the original story and from the preformance from Sir Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. Michael Gambon while capable never lived up to Harris's preformance I believe. The effects are well done and arnt overdone. More sets and wardrobe and hte implimentation of everything that could be practical being practial runs throughout the series and that is a true benefit to the enjoyment of the series and will allow them to last a long time and be enjoyed by fans both old and new for repeat viewing.",

The characters establish themselves thoroughly through behavior alone, which, for a franchise with this many characters, is not easy to do, yet this film does it seamlessly. The characters are very diverse and unique in way that one does not often see in cinema.

In many ways, this was our generation's Star Wars.  It was the 2000's pop culture phenomena.  I'm happy to say that the first film, The Sorcerer's Stone, still undoubtedly holds up.\n\nI feel like I should first mention just how impressive it is that Warner Bros and their casting directors found the perfect Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  Yes, the rest of the film is also impeccably casted with Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, and Tom Felton just to mention a few, but it's the core three characters that carry this franchise.  Watching the three of them play off each other so effectively at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring.\n\nGranted, heroes are only as good as their villains, and luckily they have a great one in Lord Voldemort.  Even though in Sorcerer's Stone it's hard to really call him in the big-bad, considering he's not resurrected yet, but his presence is definitely felt.  With that said, I wish they would have involved Professor Quirrell more in the main plot.  He's a sketchy guy, but you never get a real sense that he's working to resurrect Voldemort.  In fact, he's barely in the movie, so his presence towards the end is unexpected, but I didn't feel like it was earned.\n\nBut the mishandling of the villain doesn't diminish the tremendous amount of fun The Sorcerer's Stone brings to the young franchise.  Chris Columbus does a nice job of setting up all the relationships and characters we will come to love later like Hagrid, Dumbledore, and even Snape.

            "content": "Life in the Wizarding World\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n\nThe wondrous world of wizarding, created by J.K. Rowling, is brought to us in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first of seven movies based the world-famous Rowling's series of children's book. \n\nDirector Chris Columbus (Goonies, Mrs. Doubtfire) brings Rowling's captivating fantasy world to life, with touches of reality. A challenging task, since no films have portrayed Rowling's work before. \n\nThe plot portrays eleven-year-old orphan Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), a lonely boy who knows nothing of the wizarding world or the journey he is about to embark through over the next few years.  \n\nWhen Potter receives news that there is a wizarding school, Hogwarts, and that he has been accepted, he is more than thrilled to see what this new world contains. Harry quickly realizes who is friends are and where his loyalties lie. The \"know it all\" Hermione Granger (played by a sophisticated Emma Watson), and the reserved and meager Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), quickly become his best friends. \n\nAs the school year progresses, Potter, Weasley and Granger find out more about the wizarding world. As well as the devastations and exhilaration that can come along with it. Teacher mentors like Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) the head mistress of the Gryffindor house, along with Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) the headmaster of Hogwarts and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) Hogwarts's groundskeeper help the three friends along their journey and try to keep them out of mayhem. \n\nWhile Potter and his friends may violate rules of the school, it becomes absolutely necessary if they wish to keep themselves alive. Harry embarks on a huge undertaking to defeat the vilest of all wizards, Lord Voldemort, whom killed Harry's parents.  They share a special connection, Harry and Voldemort, which they must ultimately put to an end. \n\nWith twist and turns, Rowling keeps audiences of all kinds enthralled throughout the story. Between spells being hurled, mythical creatures coming to life and enemies engaged in action, your imagination of the wizarding world is unrestricted.",

The characters that aren't eleven years old are also very well done, and the mystery that unfolds around it is an interesting one. The score is also superb, no surprise it's done by John Williams. All these things allow me to overlook the way Christopher Columbus has an inability to pace anything fast, and the number of plot-holes that come with adapting this story.

I also wish there was more of a reason for the kids to be going after the sorcerer's stone in the first place. I get why they do it, but they are 11 years old and this is their first year at Hogwarts, I don't believe these kids would actually go out of their way to put themselves not only in this much danger, but also in a place where they are breaking every rule Dumbledore places for the students at the beginning of the year.

The sets are amazing which looks like a different world from a marketplace like Diagon Alley, to the school like Hogwarts. Steve Kloves did a great job with the script, and it has great twists in it which I watched this before I read the book. Chris Columbus also did a great job with the direction too. It has some funny moments in it and the soundtrack is just magical to listen to. The only gripe I had, is that even though the special effects are really great, there were some moments that the effects looked dated and just looked off to the scene that it's playing like the Quidditch scene, even though it's exciting to watch.

They are insanely rereadable, packing full of entrancing story, awesome characters, and so many Easter eggs, I don't think humanity has managed to figure them all out yet. I know there are seven of them, but seriously, read the books before you see the movies.\n\nThe film adaptation of the first book is very true to its source material. Yes, some of the subplots are cut out, and yes, the dialogue is streamlined and loses a lot of the whimsy that makes the book so incredible. It's still a really fun watch, and seeing it again after so many years reminds me why I love this series so much.\n\nI don't feel qualified to judge the acting of the kids in this movie. Acting is hard, and when it's something of this scope, it's tough to do. I'm going to wait a couple films before I pass judgment. The adults, however, I am more than happy to judge. Peter Griffiths and Fiona Shaw do wonderfully as the Dursleys; you love to hate them, which is the whole point of those characters. Richard Harris is Dumbledore just as I pictured him in the books. Alan Rickman sets the mood for Snape wonderfully, while Maggie Smith dominates as McGonagall. Robbie Coltrane does very well as Hagrid, showing both his compassion and occasional bumbling. Also, keep an eye out for some other well-known actors in small parts, such as John Hurt as Ollivander, and John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick.\n\nJohn Williams provides an absolutely magical score here. The famous \"Hedwig's Theme\" is heard both softly and loudly, and we get great motifs for Hogwarts, Voldemort, Quidditch, and even the chess game.\n\nIt is a touching, well-designed story that will appeal to viewers young and old alike.

It was just amazing seeing the gang all young again! This is a much 'happier' movie than the other ones in the series, as it gets darker and darker the more you come near the end. And this is one true classic for all ages to enjoy! Intriguing story, very well acted by it's young stars and the CGI, although quite noticeable is still pretty good for it's age.

            "content": "Ah Harry Potter one of my favorite franchises of all time! I decided to revisit all the Harry Potter films to catch up on some memories and reflect on still how great they are even in today's generation. Let me say the plot is unique, clever, and entertaining. The special effects is top notch to this day even though the movie released in 2001! The CGI looks amazing even though in the soccer game sequence all the characters where fully animated but it still looked very cool. The first film is really light hearted, sweet, and fun. But towards the end the movies becomes a little dark which is good. I would've liked it if the movie explored more dark elements and not just that one scene towards the end. The acting is really good and every actors looked like they were actually trying and putting in a good effort in their acting. The movie is unpredictable most of the time and when they have a twist I will become very surprised. The movie is extremely entertaining with a funny script, suspenseful scenes, and enjoyable sequences like using magic. The movie suffer flaws like the extreme run time on the movie. The movie is very slow at the beginning. Certain scenes seemed repetitive, so the movie kind of lacked inconsistency. Even though I was on the edge of my seat towards the end of the movie. The movie was over and I was dissatisfied at the end. I felt like they rushed the ending to end the run time faster. I wasn't so intrigued of the main plot of the sorcerer's stone and who stoled. I kind of felt like it was over utilized a lot for the movie and how tiring and even boring when the characters are still investigating about a stone that I don't know nor care about. Besides my minor complaints this movie is literally magical. The people who made this film made something new, original, and entertaining for all ages. The makers also made new ideas to make this movie actually work and stay to the source material of the book to boost up the movie a whole lot. That is why the Harry Potter franchise and the movie will go down in movie history. Everyone can enjoy this film it's fun for the kids and adults to watch. Also, you can't wait what is going to happen next after you watch just one. That is why I am going to give \"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone\" an A- grading!",

            "content": "Louis Buhler \nEnglish 101\n10/07/14\n\t\t\t      Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone \n\tAny Harry Potter movie can have an impact on anyone with a colorful imagination, but the first Harry Potter movie is perhaps the best. Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is the first of the epic series created by J.K. Rowlings that can be watched by the whole family. This movie has many appealing characteristics that consist of a good story line, camera work, transitions, and acting.\n\tThe storyline of The Sorcerer's Stone is very appealing to not only children that fantasize about being a wizard but to parents that can also broaden their imagination along with their child forming a new bond between them. This movie is about a boy named Harry Potter who is left on his aunt and uncle's doorstep as a baby when his parents are murdered by a dark wizard. When the dark wizard approached Harry to kill him the curse had back fired killing him and leaving Harry with only a scar. Often mistreated and misunderstood by his aunt and uncle Harry catches a break when he finds out that he too is a wizard and will attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry like his parents once did. Harry finds home in this school until he faces his worst nightmare for the first time to start this epic series. The storyline of this movie deserves a full bucket of popcorn because there's hardly a dull moment leaving your imagination run wild.\n\tThe camera work of this movie is excellent. In the first scene where the audience sees the castle there is a slow upward pan of the students paddling across the lake to the fire lit giant castle in the distance. The shots are really clear and the audience tends to lose itself in the beautiful back drops of the shots that most sometimes forget it is only a movie. The camera work of the movie deserves a full bucket of popcorn for the excellent time and effort they put into each shot.\n\tJ.K. Rowling did a great job at over looking the transitions making sure that most of the movie followed hand and hand with the book except for a few minor conflicts. Though the transitions can be drawn out from time to time it is hard to notice because you can get lost in the beauty of the castle in each drawn out shot. The transitions deserve a full bucket of popcorn because they are clear and to the point with meaningful details in each scene.\n\tThe acting of Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone was pretty good considering there was not much experience with their lead roles. Daniel Radcliffe who played the troublesome role of Harry is a son of a casting agent. Daniel made his first debut with the Harry Potter series when he auditioned for the part in 2001 soon to become one of the industries most successful actors. Rupert Grint played the role of Ronald Weasley who was Harry's best friend and partner in crime. Rupert Grint was born in England and did not have much experience in the movie industry until he too auditioned at age 11. Emma Watson played Hermione Granger who was the brains of the trio. Emma seems to have the most experience out of the three not only being an actor and model but also releasing a clothing line. The acting of this movie deserves a half a bucket of popcorn because even though the acting is decent some of the emotions seem forced and exaggerated which shows their lack of experience.\nThe movie as a whole deserves a full bucket of popcorn. Besides the acting which is easy to get past because of how impressive the three are at such a young age, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone is a great movie for the whole family. This movie will leave your imagination wandering with a wonderful bonding experience with anyone else that has seen the movie also. This movie is a must see.",

In other words, it makes me feel awful to have to say something negative about what is a good start to possibly the greatest film franchise of all time. But I want to be objective. So, I'll try to just get the negatives out the way firstly and quickly: the film definitely has not aged well. Its PS2-worthy graphics are sometimes laughable, particularly in the troll and Quidditch sequences. In addition, the film sometimes struggles to cram everything into the short space it has - for example, that the first act with the Dursleys is so short is both a curse and a blessing: we don't get to experience the nitty-gritty early years of abuse suffered by Harry that is so well documented  in the books - but on the other hand, it just means we get to the magic of Hogwarts so much faster. And finally, on a negative point, its decidedly light and almost twee tone makes it very much child-friendly, but may cause the adults to lose interest now and then. I'm sorry, but these things had to be said.\n\nBut let's face it - who cares? To anyone who's never seen or read Harry Potter before, this is the compulsory stepping stone in what turns out to be a most magnificent journey. So brilliantly crafted by Columbus and of course Rowling, Philosopher's Stone features some of the best acting talent Britain has to offer - special mentions going to Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, the late Richard Harris and, in particular, Alan Rickman as Snape - the role he was born to play. The sets depict almost exactly what any reader has ever imagined, and the kids - well - they're pretty bloody cute.\n\nPhilosopher's Stone is not the best - it's just a taste test. What happens next is delicious.",

This film for me was good, not great I must add but one movie that truly shows us something new and makes people just generally happy afterwards. It isn't awesome by any stretch of the imagination and I'll go into that later on but this does at least set a bench mark in film, one that started one of the biggest film franchises of all time.\n\nThe movie is a nice mix between a kind of light and lovely kind of thing, but then dark and oddly scary in certain ways. The movie is for the most part heart-warming and gives you a beautiful sense of \"I'm there\" kind of feeling and one which instantly connects you with the characters. The plot can have it's more terrifying moments and especially maybe for the young viewers, a certain scene including the Forbidden Forest comes to mind on that one. \n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are not great as our main heroes but they're not bad either actually, they don't really know how to act just yet but they still regain that nice sweet feeling about them which is all that counts here. The whole cast is a plethora of greats, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and many others contribute to the great cast who just make this film really what it is and make it all importantly, fun.\n\nIt's possible as they say, that Christopher Columbus the director stuck too close to the books here and really should have deviated from the scenes which well, only work in the book. I applaud him for staying true but I have to say the film is over long and stuffed full of long periods where very little happens and that can at times make this seem slightly dull. I do like Columbus here though, I think he directs well and Steve Kloves adapts the screenplay pretty well too, yet again good all round.\n\nNow one thing that may not be most remembered but for me should are the special effects which for the day are really great and make this so much more exciting at times. Certain scenes just wouldn't work without them being good and the team behind it seem to create a visually good looking film too. Staying on the way this looks the sets are magnificent and truly incredibly done, on such a large scale it is difficult but they pull it off and first time as well. \n\nI felt this film is like an epic that is both for adults and kids and that is for me what sets this apart from other such movies in the fantasy genre. It shouldn't leave anyone feeling negative afterwards and really makes you kind happy in a way that leaves you positive about the whole movie and is another reason this is so memorable. It's hard to not fall in love with the Harry Potter world, the film not so much but the thing it is set in, very much so.\n\nOverall a good movie and also one that kick-starts a huge franchise of films that are so remembered and will be for me, in years to come. It's the kind of movie that isn't great but is still a classic in senses, so many people around the world can quote it and words and phrases from this movie continue to be used in everyday speech, just magically wonderful.",

            "content": "When a film series has achieved international recognition and enjoyed enormous commercial success, it becomes very easy to believe that its eventual standard was replicated throughout its history. The appeal of Star Wars, Indiana Jones and James Bond is so widespread throughout our culture that the individual films begin to blend into a single entity; the notion of Star Wars as a very good thing makes us forget the shortcomings of the individual films.\n\nAs with each of these examples, it simply isn't the case that the Harry Potter series has always been of the highest quality. For all the praise it has garnered, especially for its impact on the British film industry, the series had a very shaky start. Watching The Philosopher's Stone now, there are times when it is hard to believe that we ever got as far as the seventh book being split into two lucrative parts. While it comes with the very best intentions, it is decidedly ill-disciplined and unengaging compared to later instalments.\n\nThe roots of this problem lie in the choice of director. J. K. Rowling's original choice had been Terry Gilliam, who was then coming off the back of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Gilliam's vision for the film was ambitious and every bit as fantastical as his work on Brazil, but the studio opted for Chris Columbus following the director's two-hour pitch to executives. Columbus' track record with family-friendly hits like Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire went down much easier than Gilliam's history of quarelling with studios and his multiple (but largely undeserved) box office failures.\n\nThis decision, taken before any of the film had been shot, shapes the entirety of both The Philosopher's Stone and its sequel. It's the classic example of a studio playing it safe, putting a potentially lucrative property in a safe pair of hands, who will in turn deliver something which will offend the least amount of people and thereby create the widest possible market. Columbus' directorial style is an accountants' dream, and the worst nightmare of anyone who cares about proper fantasy filmmaking.\n\nIn my review of Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief, I spoke about Columbus' conservative approach to the source material and how this hurt the finished project. In both cases, he opted to stay extremely faithful to the original novels, personally going through the script with Rowling to ensure that all the minor details were intact. While attention to detail is always welcome, with Columbus it manifests itself in literally putting the page on screen, in a manner which makes the whole experience much less cinematic than it could have been.\n\nThere is evidence of this throughout The Philosopher's Stone, particularly in the many long scenes with our three main characters in the corridors of Hogwarts. These scenes feel for all the world like the actors were reading their lines directly from the book, without the adjustments being made for the visual language of cinema. Not only are these scenes a lot longer and more expository than they need to be, but they give the sense of a film crew fighting against the material; the camera chases after the story, rather than grabbing it by the scruff of the neck like a proper adaptation would.\n\nBecause the talky scenes feel so much like readings from the novel, the film doesn't flow especially well. All the more action-based scenes, like the quidditch match, the broomstick lessons or the wizard's chess scene near the end, feel like set-pieces which have wandered into what otherwise resembles a recital rather than a film. And because the dialogue is often flat, these scenes don't carry the weight they they need to carry; rather than building up to, say, the chess game, it comes out of nowhere and feels like a distraction.\n\nBy attempting to cram in every last detail of the book, Columbus has committed the ironic sin of gradually alienating a mainstream audience. While fans of the book may be impressed by how faithfully certain scenes are replicated, this approach results in a film which is altogether too long and too leisurely paced. With The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson sought to be as faithful as possible to J. R. R. Tolkien's work while acknowledging the need to keep the plot moving and make changes to keep casual fans interested. Columbus has neither the skill nor seemingly the desire to pull this off, appearing to settle for dramatic longeurs to avoid upsetting fans of the book.\n\nOne could argue that this film has to be slower than those that followed it, because it has to introduce and explain so many different aspects of the world of wizards. But at the time of its release, there was never a guarantee that the series would run its course: not all the books had been written, and the studio took a big chance on the three young actors - probably the biggest chance they took on the whole production. The Fellowship of the Ring may be the gentlest instalment in Jackson's trilogy, and it does have to set up a lot of things, but it's still a rivetting thrill ride whose dynamism pulls all its interesting ideas and themes to the fore.\n\nColumbus' conservatism is also present in the visual sensibility. When pitching the film, he claimed that he wanted to make the scenes in the muggle world \"bleak and dreary\" while those in the wizard world would be \"steeped in colour, mood and detail.\" He referenced David Lean's work on Great Expectations and Oliver Twist in his chosen cinematography, while comparing the colour palettes to those in Oliver! and The Godfather.\n\nThe thing is, you would never garner any of this from actually watching The Philosopher's Stone. The scenes in the muggle world look like a dodgy American take on what a typical British household might look like: for all the charm of the late Richard Griffiths, it still feels too chocolate-box to cut the mustard. While the film does have a loosely Dickensian feel, it is not the Dickens of Lean, with its bleak shadows, striking expressionist angles and emphasis on social inequality. It is instead the Dickens of many American versions of A Christmas Carol, in which all the edges have been taken off and even the least fortunate people look like they've been well-fed for years.\n\nThis overly cosy sensibility means that many of the darker or more gruesome qualities in the story aren't allowed to have that great an impact. Some of the CG effects are pretty good, such as the sorting hat or putting the face of Voldemort on the back of Professor Quirrell's head. But when they're being presented in the context of scenes filled with warm candles and goofy jokes, they either feel like bizarre intrusions or come across as silly and unthreatening. The film plays up the sentimental aspects of the book far too much, especially in the mirror scene with Voldemort and the bedside chat between Harry and Dumbledore.\n\nIn the midst of all this disappointing mediocrity, there are a number of aspects to The Philosopher's Stone which are enjoyable, either on their own terms or within the context of the overall story. The series' biggest asset from the beginning has been its cast, with each of the three main child actors finding their feet reasonably quickly. There are some obstacles in their way, with Hermione being far more irritating than she is in the later films, but the actors feel settled in their parts and at home in front of the camera.\n\nThe adult cast are equally appealing, for a variety of different reasons. Alan Rickman was simply born to play Severus Snape: resisting the urge to turn in another Hollywood villain performance, he instead uses his unusual delivery to keep surprising you about the character. Richard Harris is very capable as Dumbledore, as is John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander: while both parts are essentially exposition with extra dollops of whimsy, both actors manage to bring some kind of weight to their dialogue. The only weak link in the adult cast is Ian Hart: while his Quirrell is convincing (if annoying), he simply isn't intimidating enough as Voldemort.\n\nThe film is also pretty funny, perhaps because we have such a strong bond with the cast in the the first place. The running gags about Hagrid breaking things and telling people things he shouldn't have done are funny throughout, as are all the bad things that befall Neville Longbottom over the course of the story. The humour is played very broadly, with much of it being set up a little too obviously, but for the most part it still feels genuine in its delivery.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a mediocre first offering in the then-fledgling franchise. Despite having a strong cast and quite a lot of entertaining humour, it's ultimately far too cautious and literal an adaptation to pass muster as a properly cinematic outing. Its flaws become all the more painfully obvious as the series grows and develops, making all its decisions to play safe seem utterly ridiculous in hindsight. While not the worst instalment in the series, it's hardly the start that we wanted or deserved.",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was always a magnificent story from my childhood with all kinds of magical appeal, so to finally watch it again as an adult I could appreciate it for everything that it was.\n\nAnd I can happily say that aside from a few flaws, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was still the magnificent piece of storytelling from my childhood.\nAs an adult I was able to identify some of the little issues in the film. Mainly they were that there were brief moments where the visual effects weren't completely stellar and looked a little rough. But then again, considering that the film is dated by 13 years I don't really blame it.\nAnd also, there is a lot to take in from the Hogwarts universe. There are many characters, mythical creatures and spells to learn from the universe, and for the wrong viewers that could be too many. Admittedly, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone manages to tie everything together well and lets the universe unfold around viewers as they sink into the universe and become seduced by its magic, but it is likely that some viewers may be overwhelmed attempting to take it all in while following the story and remembering all the characters. It isn't too likely, but there is a chance.\nStill, disregarding all of that, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a magnificent spectacle of storytelling which stays very true to its roots as a novel as well as being a generally exceptional fantasy venture.\nThanks to impeccable direction from Chris Columbus, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone manages to work as a large success in various areas of storytelling and achieve amazing visual feats at the same time. \nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has no problem telling its magical story and it stays to the same path of J.K. Rowling's source novel perfectly. It captures the essence of the novel's magic and depicts its universe near-flawlessly. The screenplay in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone captures the language of the novel and all the characters with it, and combines it with a touch of humour which always comes well timed even if it feels a little pretentious on occasion. It makes Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone a thoroughly well written feature with a lot of strong characters and intelligently conceived humour against the backdrop of a simple story in a complex universe. And there is a lot to learn from it as it covers themes of friendship, heroism and magic as well as many other things very well.\nAnd from a visual perspective, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is unforgettable. As well as benefitting from fairly effective visual effects, the entire film features outstanding costumes and a powerful production design all shot on some unforgettably beautiful scenery which is vibrant with colour and stunning imagery which flawlessly establishes the universe of the film and never looks back. The design of Hogwarts itself is unforgettable, and it makes everything full of a lot of rich realism to boast. Fantasy films rarely feel as real as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and thanks to its visual characteristics and it's gradual pace in which it reveals more and more of them, audiences learn practically as much about Hogwarts itself as Harry Potter does as he enters the world and comes to face everything within it. Everything is also captured with excellently angled cinematography which captures the mood of each scene as well as the scale of the spectacle, always moving gently and never becoming too shaky or quick for its own good.\nAnd as an atmospheric venture, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone boasts powerful sound effects which are edited into perfect timing of the film, all against the backdrop of an unforgettable musical score composed by the legendary John Williams himself. The music in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is perfect and always tunes into the emotions of the scenes well, so it can be boasted as being some of John Williams' finer work.\nAnd refusing to stop with all these positive film aspects to boast, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone manages to even ride to skills of an exceptional cast into the sky and soar. It's because the cast all are convinced that Hogwarts is real and so they don't play the characters, they embody them flawlessly and being them to life. And these is not one miscast, but simply too many to talk positively about so I have to narrow it down.\nDaniel Radcliffe is the perfect choice for the role of the titular Harry Potter. He is easy to sympathise for from the first second he is on screen, and from there and forth he just grows and develops. He has the innocence of being unknowing of the wizardry world at the start of the film which later develops into a thirst for knowledge and adventure which makes him an awesome hero. Daniel Radcliffe has a natural juvenile British charm which makes him perfect for the role, and the way he interacts with all the other cast members exhibits a certain skill that usually requires years of acting experience to achieve. Daniel Radcliffe nails the role of Harry Potter, and he deals with the lines with sophisticated talent which is just terrific.\nRupert Grint's performance as Ron Weasley is also terrific. Sharing an excellent chemistry with his many co-stars and mainly with Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, Rupert Grint establishes the sort of anxious uncertainty of the Hogwarts universe which is perfect for the character. His nervous attitude and consistent neuroticism make him the ideal decision for the role of Ron Weasley, and with his own juvenile charm he manages to perfect both the physical and emotional aspects of the character. He is a large source of the comic relief in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and he succeeds at it without any real problem whatsoever.\nAnd Emma Watson is unforgettable in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Playing the smart female archetype who dominates the three main protagonists her book smarts, Emma Watson's confidence and sharp line delivery makes her the living embodiment of the character Hermione Granger. She is such a charming and lovable figure yet irritating at the same time. She finds that balance so that she never puts all her performance skills into playing one single archetype. She balances between them and acts with such an intelligent gusto, the kind that a strong character like Hermione Granger really needs to be brought to life. And Emma Watson finds that and delivers it with a flawless charm and impeccable chemistry with the surrounding cast members. Emma Watson is a flawless casting choice in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and her confidence and demeanour is just refreshing.\nRobbie Coltrane also makes himself an icon for his performance as Rubeus Hagrid in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. He takes on a role looking so different to himself but never deviates far from his natural Scottish charm. Personally, Hagrid is my favourite character of all the Harry Potter series because of his chemistry with the young cast which is very friendly, the fact that Robbie Coltrane's performance gives a certain strong honesty to the character and simply because he takes a character that is commonly a thin figure and makes him a deep and meaningful character with a lot of dedication to line delivery and physical nature of his character. Robbie Coltrane is an excellent British actor, and his role as Rubeus Hagrid flawlessly overshadows his other appearances in films such as Mona Lisa or guest spots on Blackadder. Robbie Coltrane is impossible not to like as Rubeus Hagrid, and he just steals the screen whenever he appears on it.\nRichard Harris' performance as Professor Albus Dumbledore is too easily perfect because he captures the same kind of wisdom that Sir Ian McKellen captures in the role of Gandalf the Grey in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, though in a more restrained performance. Richard Harris simply delivers his words with a simple peaceful charisma which is no challenge for an actor as skilled as he. Richard Harris creates a perfect support for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in his performance, and he is a true genial presence.\nMaggie Smith has a certain mix of wisdom and sass about her in the role of Professor as Minerva McGonagall. She has an ability to dominate which comes with her age and the sense that she has a vast understanding of the universe that the young protagonists are just learning about. Her small amount of screen time manages to make an impact on Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall, and her line delivery and facial expressions ensure that her character stands strong amongst a big crowd of talent.\nAlan Rickman has a certain mysterious dark quality about him which makes him perfect for the role of Severus Snape, the same mysterious darkness that gave him a career breakthrough for playing antagonist Hans Gruber in the action classic Die Hard. He constantly leaves audiences asking questions due to his his unpredictable nature which is shrouded in mystery, and it is quite frankly one of his greatest roles to date. The character Severus Snape manages to capitalise on the endeavour of Alan Rickman's various acting talents, and he plays the part with serious gusto.\nTom Felton is also an awesome presence, and John Cleese, Warwick Davis, John Hurt, Ian Hart and Richard Griffiths all manage to make fine additions to the cast as well by contributing their own dedication to the characters and fine line delivery in their respective roles.\n\nSo riding an impeccable universe as the medium for telling its meaningful magical story, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is an exceptional start to a film series that would later become highest grossing film series of all time.",

            "content": "Many people now has been started to wonder, is it a bad thing that almost every movie in Hollywood ends happily? Cause in real life, after all, success and happiness only last for a short time, but movie makes an illusion to the public that happiness could last, like, forever. Forever is a word that belongs to god, and, after all, in human's word people all end as dead after all. So those film people started to talk about ending a film unhappily, but this movie shows me that Happy ending is worth remaining.\n\tI know it's kind of silly to bring up this happy ending idea because it's used so often that we sometimes even didn't aware that a film has ended happily, couples get together, wrongs are righted, epiphanies experienced, crimes solved, villains apprehended. However, cause some people work in the film area, and they use all day long to think about every part of a film. \n\tHave u ever thought about what if the film ends unhappily... say, Harry dead for protection of the Sorcerer's stone. Of course it's not gonna happen because there are still six other films to shot, but here I just suppose that there could be a new protagonist, Jim Potter in the next films. What will Harry's death do to the audience? I know I would break my heart, and probably decide not to watch another Potter magic film. So there might be business loss if the film ends unhappily.\n\tLet's think another way, say, Harry and his friends all survived, but the stone was stolen. Then the film would look like just a waste of time. I get this kind of feeling like I spent a week to prepare a quiz, but I failed. That could happen, and that has happened to me actually, but it just feels so bad. People wouldn't like going to the cinema for this kind of feeling, and the rate of harry Potter on Rotten Tomato would be amazingly low. So films end happily because most people like watching happy endings.\n\t In this movie, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are the representatives of good, and Voldemort is the bad guy. With the spiritual core concept, Voldemort has to be beaten by the good ones. Hollywood's favor towards happy endings reflects the USA's history of pioneers. America is the spiritual home of new beginnings, which may be why it has always had a soft spot, a special gift, for happy endings. People tend to have positive ideas, and believing in good always beats bad is the reason some pioneers insist. With the spiritual core concept, Voldemort has to be beaten by the good ones. It's also a way to spread positive thought to the public.\n\tIn my opinion, if over being used, unhappy endings could also be regarded as clich\u00e9. What I really dislike is those \"happy endings\" that the grounds for the happiness have not really been prepares, where it feels imposed and strictly obligatory. I think a good balance is when an ending can match the tone of the rest of the film and still surprise, at least leave me thinking, just like the Harry Potter series had done.",

            "content": "Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone is the first and most family-friendly of a great series. It's perhaps one of the best starts to an epic series that only gets better as it goes along. The story isn't new in some places, but the idea of a school for wizards has never been done nearly as well as this. (Yes Wizard School by Jane Yolen I mean you). The visual effects are astounding and trully ahead of their time. The characters are all very memorable, and have been very well-casted. If I decided to write an opinon of every character I'd be writing this review for a very long time. Harry Potter himself is one of the greatest fictional heroes of all time in my opinion and this movie may show it best. He does what  many good heroes do and dives into the unknown with courage and loyalty to his friends. He doesn't know magic like some of his friends do as he was raised by Muggles, but he still does his best and (spoiler alert) winds up saving the day. Ron is a comic relief character done WELL. He does contribute to the story, and does wind up helping Harry and Hermoine in the end. Like many other characters he shows true bravery and is willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. Hermoine is a great heroine in the sense that her ability to master spells doesn't come from bloodline or great power but more from her own brain. Professor Dumbledore (played much better by Richard Harris) is a great mentor character, but still has some entertaining lines here and there. Snape is a very seemingly sinister character, but his complexity that develops as the series goes on is fascinating. Voldemort is a very iconic villian, and there's a very good plot twist related to who's been helping him. The movie is exciting,entertaining, and at times quite funny. It shouldn't let any fan of the series or any non-hater for that matter (yes I'm including you prude Christians in that) disappointed. See it for yourself and make your own decision.",

That long ago!?!? Yeah, man, feel old yet? I still remember being against the hype like: \"Harry Potter? What kind of title is that for a movie?\" And of course, I never got around to watching the first adaptation of J.K Rowling's now-renowned book series in theaters. But once it was out, it was a huge hit. I still recall how big the merchandise was on that Halloween because when my school did it's annual \"show off your costumes parade,\" I was that one kid who didn't really know about it and who had yet to see it. In fact, I didn't get to watch 'Harry Potter' until the following summer on a trip to California (my relatives had HBO). But once I did watch 'the Sorcerer's Stone'--I fell into the hype of its sequels (for the most part). Chris Columbus just nails everything to near perfection (even if the movie's running length is a bit too long); the set designs the costumes, the special effects, etc. One scene that stands out to me till this day is when Harry and his friends enter Hogwarts for the first time--if I didn't know any better, I'd say I was there with those kids. If Columbus supplied the image of magic, then John Williams supplied the sound of what it means to be a wizard. Another memory I recall is being in music class, my teacher began to play pieces from famous composers (Bach, Mozart, etc) and as soon as 'Hedwig's Theme' played, EVERYONE shouted. \"John Williams! I love that movie!\" All of that aside, 'the Sorcerer's Stone' is a great film, I never thought that it'd have spawn like 8 more movies but at the same time--there'd never been a movie like this before and it's not hard to see why it became the smashing hit that it was and remains to be.",

            "content": "The Sorcerer's Stone gets off to a pretty uneven start with the insanely over the top antics of the Dursley family. Thankfully though, once they are out of the picture and we get to Hogwarts, the movie settles down and is really very watchable. As for performances, the young cast, while very charming do let their inexperience show from time to time. They are though well supported by the more experienced adults Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane. Alan Rickman is especially effective as Severus Snape.\n\nThe technical side of this production is also a mixed bag. For the most part the effects work. Especially within Hogwarts as the students negotiate moving staircases and animated artwork. The effects become a little less impressive during the flying sequences on brooms. It's pretty easy to pick out the moments when the live action actor has been replaced with CGI.\n\nOverall though this is a very solid first outing for the Potter series. It's a lot of fun, and with help from an excellent score from the genius composer John Williams, quite magical!\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nI can't imagine there's anyone out there that read the book, and then didn't see the film. If you are new the Potter series. Just expect a fun magical ride. It's opening ten minutes are a little uneven, but once you're past that, the film has many strengths. The story is good, and the young cast do a pretty decent job breathing life into their popular characters.\n\nBest Format:\n\nDespite some of the few questionable visual effects, this is still best viewed on a big screen. At home, a HD viewing is a must.\n\nBest element for me:\n\nThere's a lot to like here, but I'd have to say Alan Rickman's performance was the stand out for me. \n\nhttp://www.TalkieGazette.com",

            "content": "Back to the beginning.....\nTen year old Harry Potter(Daniel Radcliffe) is an orphan living with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who couldn't care less about him. They are nothing but cruel to him. After some mysterious letters addressed to Harry, the family runs away to a miserable hut in a rock. They completely ignored the fact that that night was Harry's eleventh birthday. On the dot of midnight on Harry's birthday, a giant called Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane) breaks down the door and tells Harry something that the Dursleys had been holding for years: Harry was a wizard. Within two minutes of entering the magical world, it becomes obvious that Harry is famous, although Hagrid was reluctant to tell him why. Finally, with persuasion, Hagrid tells the reason for Harry's fame: Harry's dead parents didn't die in a car crash;they were murdered by the most dangerous, evil, dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort. It is alarming how close Harry came to being killed himself. Amazingly though, the death curse failed to kill Harry, instead, it rebounded on Voldemort, who fled. Then Harry arrives at Hogwarts, a wizard boarding school in England. He becomes fast friends with Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint) and archenemies with Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton). They develop dislike for the bossy, know-it-all girl in their year, Hermione Granger(Emma Watson). But Harry and Ron extend friendship toward Hermione after they  overcame a mountain troll, saving her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are happy with all of their teachers-with the obvious exception of unfathomable Professor Snape(Alan Rickman). After Harry nearly has what would've been a fatal fall from his broomstick, Harry, Ron, and Hermione's dislike of Snape increases; it was clear to them that Snape was trying to kill Harry in an \"accident\". Their proof for this conclusion is that Hermione had seen Snape jinxing the broom-Harry would've died if not for Hermione's quick action of setting fire to Snape's cloak. Loathing turns to hatred when Harry figures out that Snape is after the something that is being guarded by Hagrid's monstrous three headed dog, \"Fluffy\".  With some brilliance on Hermione's part, the three of them realize that anyone would want the something that Fluffy's guarding; it's the Sorcerer's Stone. It's a stone that transforms metal into gold and makes the Elixir of Life, a potion that makes people immortal. Then Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through a detention(because they were out to see Hagrid; also just in time to see Norbert the dragon hatch) in the forbidden forest that changes their whole perspective of the situation. Harry and Malfoy pair together in the search of a hurt unicorn. But when they found it, dead, it wasn't alone. A hooded figure was kneeling by the wound, drinking the unicorn's blood. Malfoy screamed and bolted, but Harry-blinded with the pain of the lighting shaped scar on his forehead-stumbled, trying to back away from the figure, which was coming as if to attack. But before it had the chance, Harry was rescued by a centaur named Frinzee. Frinzee gave a startling answer to Harry's question of \"what was that thing you saved me from?\". Although the answer was indirect, it helped Harry see the seriousness of the situation. It was none other than Voldemort himself who had attacked Harry and\"I think if he'd have the chance he would've tried to kill me tonight\". Snape was trying to get the stone for Voldemort, who would be restored to full strength using the Elixir of Life. Once he's back, Voldemort would have nothing in mind except murdering Harry. Harry and Ron greatly appreciated Hermione's comforting words \"we're forgetting one thing:Who's the one  wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched\". While walking with Ron and Hermione, Harry had a lightbulb: \"Don't you think that it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger turns up and just happens to have one? How many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?\" After a really brief anxious talk with Hagrid, Harry's worst suspicions were confirmed. Hagrid had told the stranger(which was obviously Snape in disguise) how to get past Fluffy! They run to tell Dumbledore(Richard Harris), only to the electrifying news that he wasn't there! It was plain as day that Snape had sent a fake message to get Dumbledore out of the way, so he could steal the stone that night. Harry, Ron, and Hermione bravely and unanimously decide to follow Snape in an attempt to thwart him. They encounter a series of enchantments, which include a plant which strangles you unless you relax, a room full of vicious flying keys, and a giant chess game. After Ron got knocked out in the chess game, Hermione stays behind and Harry goes forward because, as Ron had said \"Harry, it's you that has to go on, I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you.\"  In the last chamber, a shock was in store for Harry. He expected to meet Snape (and maybe Voldemort), but the man who was in the chamber was........Professor Quirell (Ian Hart). After getting over the surprise, Harry registered one fact: Quirell was trying to get the stone. Before he could decide on any action, a voice that seemed to come from Quirell himself, though he wasn't speaking, said \"Use the boy\". Quirell shouted for Harry, who saw his reflection putting the stone in his pocket, once he stepped in front of the mirror(that was the key to finding the stone). A quick touch to his pocket told Harry that incredibly, he had gotten the stone! But of course, he lied to Quirell. But then the mysterious voice said \"He lies...\". After a short try to force Harry to tell the truth, the voice said \"Let me speak to him\". Quirell said to the voice that it was not strong enough, but the voice insisted. You'll be very surprised to see what's under Quirell's turban(unless you've read the book before, like me). A head, which confirmed his identity as Voldemort, was sticking out of Quirell's! I won't spoil the rest of the details, but the battle that follows, although rather light(that completely switched around later on), is ausome! I wish I would've been a kid when this came out. But the truth is that I was only five months old at the time when it was released(you got it right; I'm twelve and a half now, and this is brother's account, I'm actually Kayla). So I was disappointed, when I began riding in the Harry Potter roller coster when I was nine, that all the movies except the last two (sixth had just came out) were already done. I missed the excitement of having the new movies come out every year or two. But although the anticipation was missed; I remain adoring of this movie, done when I was just a baby, by actors and actresses who are double my age.\n\nA+",

But every franchise has a beginning, and as the first book in the series, The Sorcerer's Stone was that film.\n\nFortunately, under the direction of Chris Columbus, this movie took off like a Nimbus 2000!  The Sorcerer's Stone succeeds on so many levels, not only for adapting the novel, but also for creating an entire world filled with witches, wizards, and all of the many mythical creatures we've all heard of in legend.  This film is so much fun and is really engaging, even for those who haven't read the book.  And for those who have read the book, you will be pleasantly surprised at how close the film remains to the book.  In fact, of all of the Harry Potter films, this one is one of the truest adaptions of the novels.  The casting of Richard Harris as Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is nothing short of genius.\n\nThe Sorcerer's Stone is definitely recommended.  Anyone can enjoy it.  I will say that this movie is more geared towards children, and lacks the darker tone of the later films, but for a first installment that is introducing us to the characters, that is perfectly acceptable.  And finally, some advice: Read the novel before you watch this film.  Not only will it keep you spoiler free when you're reading it, but it will help you to better appreciate this film.",

            "content": "This magical start to the family-beloved series of films is a charming, whimsical, and child-like fantasy held together by an entertaining story completely accurate to the book. However, I believe the film would have been a tad better if the acting hadn't been so childlike at parts.\n\nPLOT: Young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) was left on the doorstep of his abusive relatives, the Dursleys, as a baby and is now about age eleven, still living in the closet under the stairs and hoping for more. Things change days from Harry's birthday when a letter comes in the mail for Harry, which never happens usually. Despite the constant flow of letters from the same address every day, Harry never gets to read one due to his relatives' incessant doing away with them. It even gets so bad that the Dursleys have to move overseas with Harry to escape the tirade of letters. However, a great man named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) burst down the door and informs Harry that he's a famous wizard from two famous wizard parents and has been invited to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry unknowingly goes where he's astounded by the world of magic and where he meets his best friends, awkward Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and know-it-all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). Things are going well with Harry in this new lifestyle until he realizes of a danger involving a secret stone and a dark lord. It's a great plot executed very well.\n\nACTING:The acting in here is pretty great for the most part. The performances, whether young or not, are iconic either way. Out of the adult performances, the best would have to be from Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, and Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell. These three seemed to be the most excellently played and most captivating of the adult performances. The more childlike performances were pretty okay for younger kids. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson weren't the most expert actors at the time obviously, but their performances, whether childish or not, are iconic in the world of film. I don't believe their performances were the best by all means, but they definitely went down in history. The other performances I'd like to mention would be Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Richard Griffiths as Dudley Dursley, Richard Brummer as He Who Must Not Be Named, John Hurt as Mr. Olivander, and John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick.\n\nSCORE:The score in this film is very well composed by the great John Williams and sets the magical mood for the film very well. The theme in this film is almost as iconic as the performances are.\n\nEFFECTS:The digital effects in this film are still very high-end for being made in the early 2000s. The digital effects of \"Fluffy\", the paintings, the baby dragon, and everything are very well done and realistic for being made in the early 2000s.\n\nOTHER CONTENT:This is one of the film series that goes down in history as memorable and iconic. This start of the film series starts us off in a very playful mood with a childlike wonder and great accuracy to the book. This definitely isn't the best of the Harry Potter films, but we all have to start somewhere, and starting off this light is a very great accomplishment.\n\nOVERALL,a great fantasy with a great plot, pretty great and iconic acting, iconic and magical score, fairly high-end special effects for the early 2000s, and a very playful mood to start on, but the childlike performances almost deter the overall performance of the film.",

I embarked on a marathon with my cousin who had never seen any of the Harry Potter films about a year ago and I recently watched it this summer with a 5-year old girl just watching it for the first time. When Harry Potter flies his broom for the first time, I notice her face light up. That's when it occurred to me that this film is truly magical. Not only is the plot about kids and magic, but it is magical movie how it strives on the human emotion. Not since Star Wars has a movie franchise really moved me like this. Happy, Sad, Angry, Scared. All these emotions are front and centre and in full effect. Yeah, if you are seeing this for the first time as an older teenager, it might not have the same effect but this is one of the best franchises to expose your kids to. Sure there are some dark scenes for little children but there are so many more uplifting scenes that it really doesn't matter. A great start to a great story which are the Harry Potter films!",

To me, I never understood back in elementary school why everyone who was anyone and their grandmother praised this series, it was boring a young me thought. But I decided to re-watch it as an adult, and much to my surprise, I feel the exact same way. It's your basic Moses rags to riches story where Harry is shunned by his extended family after his parent's death and soon receives tons of mail asking him to attend Hogwarts where him and his family are famed celebrities. That's basically the first 15 minutes of the film, people shouting \"Harry! Harry Potter!\" with great joy as I'm thinking to myself \"What is so great about this kid?\" Apparently he's the only person Voldemort, the evil villian, didn't kill. And he has the scar to prove it. The first hour is devoted solely to him and his getting used to at Hogwarts, kind of similar to what a college kid would go through. It's just a snorefest, I'm sorry. Now is the film a complete failure? No, not really. The cinematography looks pretty and for its time is pretty pleasing to look at. Is there no redeemable moments? Actually no, there are plenty. The downside is, they are too short. The run through all the obstacles they face takes like a minute and it's not really gripping enough. The climax was a cool plot twist with the villain, but its all messed up when Harry all of a sudden has the stone out of nowhere and kills Voldemort with literally his bare hands. That's it, his bare hands! Where is the creativity in that? I don't know, it may just be in me and I am definitely in the minority. But granted this came out the same year as Fellowship of the Ring, one of my favorite movies, I was just expecting so much more. As far as I'm concerned, it was a major letdown that definitely didnt have to be and shouldn't have been.",

Everything is brighter and fantastically whimsical here, but the film doesn't shy away from being at least somewhat scary at parts.  As a child, I probably wouldn't be exaggerating in saying that this film changed me as much as 'Star Wars' and 'Jurassic Park' did.

He was the family member most like me and the only one I really remain in contact with as an adult, and back then he always brought home a neat present whenever he went traveling (he had quite the wanderlust in him).  And that year he brought me a strange book, telling me that \"everyone was reading it\" in the U.K. and he felt that it wouldn't be too long before people started reading it here too.  And my god, was he right.\n\nHowever, this is not why I am here.  I am here to talk about a movie based off that incredible book that I loved so much.  Almost four years after I discovered Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone (it was still called that then as the US publication hadn't come out yet), I was fairly damn excited to see how the film adaption would go.  The first Lord of the Rings film was only about a month away and I was hoping for something not too different.  And...well I really loved the film when it first came out, but looking at it and the book again, as an adult...it's a lot sillier than I remember.  Now maybe it's because of course I'm an adult now and no longer a kid and too used to gritty things like HBO, but Harry Potter as a franchise has definitely aged.  Don't get me wrong, the first film is still great...but not as great as I remember.  While I wasn't surprised that the film was fairly long for it's time (the book wasn't exactly short either), but it was so predictable, probably even for somebody who hadn't read the books.  And yes, while Daniel Radcliffe did grow into his role and became much better, he wasn't too great here, but he was a frickin' kid, what do you expect? Either way what held the film together in my opinion were the supporting cast members, ie Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris (RIP).  They're definitely great in their respective roles and feel like the glue while the child actors were still trying to define themselves in their roles.  But this was only the first movie, join me next time to see how the second one holds up!",

And I was correct.  Essentially, I got what I expected, which- in this case- isn't a bad thing, but is it unfair to have hoped for a bit more from one of the most famed film series of all time?\n\nHarry Potter is an orphan child that is taken to Hogwarts (a school for wizards) upon being informed that he has magical abilities.  Harry befriends Ron Weasely and Hermione Granger, and it isn't long until the trio discover a villainous plan to steal the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\nAs far as fantasy films go, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is pretty solid.  A lot of things are going for it.  The characters are likeable, the acting is good, and the story- while extremely familiar- is engaging.  At the same time, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has no small number of issues either.\n\nThe length is one of the biggest problems.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has a two and a half hour run time, and frankly, the tale seems absurdly slight for a film of such length.  Indeed, there seems to be no real middle in the story.  Just an absurdly long beginning and a really fast ending.  The film just kept building up to something, but ultimately there was nothing to build up to.  The treasure here lays in the journey, not the destination, but it would've been nice to have a little more meat in the conclusion.\n\nThe other most notable issue is the special effects.  While there are a number of effects that are pulled off quite well, the vast majority are hopelessly dated, cheap looking, and even phony at times.  One's tolerance towards this may vary depending on the person.  The film is entertaining enough to be enjoyed in spite of dubious effects, though they can be quite distracting at times (and downright laughable at others).\n\nThe acting is mostly good, though as the film deals with children, the acting is far from excellent.  Daniel Radcliffe is respectable as Harry Potter, but there are a number of poorly delivered lines on Radcliffe's part.  Emma Watson is good as Hermione Granger too, but the highlight of the children actors is Rupert Grint giving a standout performance as Ron Weasley.  Richard Griffiths has a small, but highly memorable bit, as the father of a spoiled child.\n\nThe score, composed by John Williams, is appropriately magical.  With a very memorable main theme, and some really excellent action music, this is a superb fantasy score.\n\nThe best thing about Harry Potter is that it creates an environment you want to return to.  You want to spend more time with the characters, you want to spend more time at Hogwarts.  But you also want to have something to do while you're there.  And there's simply not enough going on to justify a 152 minute run time.  Still, most of the film works, and there are some really good ideas here.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone isn't quite enchanting, but it does cast a rather good spell.",

That effect does occasionally get lathered on a bit thick, but a speedy pace and densely populated realm are usually enough to compensate for such moments. JK Rowling's rich, sprawling, imaginative world is downright hypnotizing on the screen, loaded with treats and treasures, and it's tough to look away for even an instant. Although the CGI work is distractingly bad in a few instances (it very nearly ruins the Quidditch match), the child actors are average at best and there isn't much adversity to our heroes' hunt for the MacGuffin Stone, it's still a cheery, entertaining introduction to a universe that's positively buzzing with potential.",

            "content": "2001 was the beginning of two of the biggest franchises of all-time, with one of them being the highest-grossing. That franchise would be Harry Potter, a franchise based on the highly popular books by JK Rowling. Is Harry Potter worth the hype? Well, it's certainly no Star Wars, but it's a million gazillion times better than the garbage that is Twilight.\n\nOrphaned boy Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is living with his cruel aunt and uncle (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths) who tell him that his parents were drunks who died in a car crash. But on his 11th birthday, Harry meets Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), who tells him that he is a wizard and that his parents were also wizards who were actually killed by an evil wizard named Voldemort, and that somehow, Harry, as a baby, managed to defeat the evil wizard, making Harry \"The Boy Who Lived.\" Harry then goes with Hagrid and goes to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy, a place where Harry can learn about how to be a good wizard. There, he gains two good friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and an enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).\n\nBut the fun begins when Voldemort's spirit, who still wants to destroy Harry, wants to become human again, and he's using a Hogwarts professor to attempt to steal the Sorcerer's Stone, an object that can make a person immortal. It's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to risk their lives to defeat Voldemort once and for all.\n\nThe first chapter also stars Richard Harris as Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore,  Maggie Smith as transfiguration professor McGonagall, Alan Rickman as potions professor Snape, Ian Hart as professor Quirrell, and John Hurt as wand maker Ollivander.\n\nAs I said, Harry Potter is the highest-grossing franchise of all-time, but that doesn't necessarily mean that's a good thing. There are some issues involved in this film. First off, as a fan of the book, I was not impressed with the lack of dark tone, like the book had. It seemed like the producers and director Chris Columbus, famous for comedies like Home Alone, didn't want to scare the little kids, even though there are some scary moments in the film, such as Voldemort's appearance. However, the rest of the franchise goes into darker territory, giving the franchise it's true potential.\n\nAlso, the pacing is a little too slow for a two and a half hour movie. Because it stays too true to the book, the film lacks a bit of originality and makes some of the teaching moments a little dull. Thankfully, the producers took this mistake and made improvements as the franchise goes on.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the first Harry Potter is a bad film. Actually, for the most part, this is a good film. Visual wise, the first Harry Potter is impressive. Many of the CG effects are very realistic, from an evil troll, to people flying around the school on broomsticks in a Quidditch match (sort of like basketball and soccer with a bit of flying), to a centaur who helps Harry along the way.\n\nThe casting is also well-done. Featuring an all-British cast, the casting is well-done. The three main child actors, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, early on, have the personalities of great actors, particularly Emma Watson. Richard Harris is memorable as Dumbledore, and it would have been interesting to see how he would have done the role had he lived long enough to do the whole franchise. Other fantastic roles include Maggie Smith, Richard Griffiths, and Robbie Coltrane. But who really steals the show in this? For me, it would be Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. His voice and personality steals every scene and not only is his character a little menacing, but also really entertaining and sometimes funny. I bet Rickman had fun doing this role for 10 years.\n\nAnother highlight would be the John Williams score. The theme song is one of his most memorable, and while he's made better scores, there's still some things to love in a John Williams score, and this is one of them.\n\nSo in the end, while the pacing is slow and there's a lack of pure darkness in a film that should have a dark tone, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a decent beginning to what would be the highest-grossing franchise of all-time.",

It's a fun and adventurous film that's lighthearted and silly, and it has a lot of downfalls because of it. It's predictable and really geared towards children. \r\n\r\nThe special effects are AWFUL. The Fellowship of the Ring came out the same year as this. You could argue that it had a bigger budget, but even then they took time to polish the CGI while making two other movies beside of it and they were realistic and groundbreaking for the time that hold up 10 years later. Even then, they had a lot of practical effects that also looked good. If they're going to make us look at these special effects the whole movie and keep them on screen for extended periods of time because YOU think they look good, polish them and spend time on them because they're absolutely awful when they came up.\r\n\r\nDumbledore, Hans Snape and other experienced actors are really good, but the kids just need more talent. The highlight of the film was definitely the quiditch match.

There is a lot of initial character development that goes on in this film to explain why friendships, rivalries, and amnities rise up through the rest of the series. There is mystery in this film but that is overshadowed by the focus on the mythical world where magic reigns supreme.\n\nSUMMARY- the perfect playground for the imagination. RECOMMENDED!",

I remember watching this movie in the theaters as a kid, and then journeying back into the books, re-reading the whole series for the third time.

This point is of course null and void due to the fact that they're all grown up now, and have proven themselves as actors! All of the professors make outstanding acting decisions and the ensemble cast is neatly, and masterfully, outlined with the finest Britain had to offer. 4/5",

A trilha sonora \u00e9 emocionante. H\u00e1 muitos momentos que se consegue alcan\u00e7ar com sucesso o clima dram\u00e1tico, aterrorizante e divertido proposto pelo livro do qual este foi baseado. Temos \u00f3timos atores, como Maggie Smith (Minerva), Alan Rickman (Snape), Richard Harris (Dumbledore) entre muitos outros. \nUm bom filme, mas que acaba errando em coisas que deveriam ter sido evitadas por conta da excelente mat\u00e9ria prima (o livro de Rowling) que eles tinham em m\u00e3os.",

            "content": "The Harry Potter film series never really slipped below a good quality, though Order of the Phoenix came closest, but it did have it's better movies.  Half Blood Prince was a real surprise as a film given that the book felt like it was largely stalling for time.  The first entry, The Philosopher's Stone, can proudly count itself amongst the better Potter movies.\nGiven the brevity of the novel, and the considerable running time of the film, the inaugural HP adventure is the most fully realised.  This acts in benefit to the later films as time is well spent on introducing all the players who would remain throughout the run, without having to sacrifice chunks of the story.\nFor the one person maybe reading this who doesn't know, Philosopher's Stone introduces Harry Potter to the world of witchcraft and wizardry and charts the course of his first eventful year at Hogwarts and begins his battle with the evil Voldamort.\nChris Columbus produced a brilliantly detailed film here.  Every nook and cranny has been carefully sculpted to suit the Potter world.  Casting is flawless.  The three young leads introduce us to the high standard they would consistently deliver, though Daniel Radcliffe's nerves were still evident as Potter himself at this stage.\nAlan Rickman added Professor Snape to his rogue's gallery and Tom Felton is impressively despicable as Draco Malfoy.\nThe film hits all the action beats of J.K. Rowling's debut novel.  The Quidditch scene is outstanding.  Fast and violent, it's an exhilarating watch.  The journey into the forbidden forest is creepy and worthy of some horror movies, while the finale pushes the boundary of what could have been acceptable in a PG rated movie.  Though little of him is seen in this movie, Chris Columbus combines all these things to make us believe that Voldamort is very bad news indeed.\nApart from the thriller like Prisoner of Azkaban, when all the cast were really hitting their stride and you had some great additions, Philosopher's Stone is probably the best of the Harry Potter movies on account of its detail and sense of adventure.  A cracking way to kick off this beloved series.",

The first installment is a solid start., though it certainly has some issues.\n\nSomething that often bothers me about fantasy tales is that there are rarely rules and limitations set upon the universe. Without rules or limitations, writers can feel free to have as many conveniences as they want. This isn't really a big problem with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but I could see it becoming a troublesome issue. The film does have one big problem, however, which is that a lot of what occurs in the film and what exists in the universe makes little to no sense under logical examination or is simply left unexplained. Quidditch is way too dangerous and risky to be played at any school (even a school of witchcraft and wizardry), and there is no way that the violent acts committed during the game would be considered acceptable. Ron didn't need to get hurt at all, since he didn't even need to get on top of the knight. The troll could have just hit Harry with his hand instead of his club. What do the Muggles see when wizards and witches enter Platform Nine and Three Quarters? That that is the only significant gripe I have with the film that I can really elaborate upon. Overall, the film is enjoyable, yet not really noteworthy as a standalone work of art.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an entertaining fantasy adventure film with a likable cast, no visual style, a great score by the talented John Williams, a well-executed twist, some impressive special effects, and good costume design.",

Lo que yo opino de esta cinta es que fue buena. Se respet\u00f3 con detalles los hechos del libro. Eso es destacable por cierto. El carism\u00e1tico grupo de actores fue una buena elecci\u00f3n. A pesar de todo, hay algunas partes en contra. Primero, estar demasiado ligado al libro. Respetar la narrativa como lo presenta el libro est\u00e1 bien, aunque creo que se exager\u00f3 un poco. Los efectos especiales todav\u00eda no estaban al cien por ciento, a pesar de las escenas llamativas.\u00bfVale la pena verla?

Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. With that said it is worth watching at least once.",

I think that since they were trying to follow the book so closely, the pacing may have sufferred and a lot of things don't go into much detail.

The child actors all carry a decent effort in bringing characters like Harry and Draco to life, but you're glad there's some more experienced helpings from Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith to break up some of the less graceful line deliveries by our first year heroes.",

And it's all because of this, a great movie that both kids and adults will like, and one that will go down as the beginning of something special and remarkable.  And it's not even the best movie in the series.\r\n\r\n\"Sorcerer's Stone\" is remembered because of its willingness to stay as close as possible to its source material, something not a lot of movies can succeed at doing but something that it pulled off spectacularly.  I was amazed watching the movie in the theater when I was but 14.  Back then, I thought it was the greatest thing ever; now, I still think it's pretty damn good.\r\n\r\nThis movie will stay in the back of the minds of even the people who hate Harry Potter and everything that he stands for because of its Star Wars-like nature.

Sometimes it follows the novel too closely with some characters and ideas that overall could have been left out (the ghosts for example, do not play an important part in this first story) and at times it's awkward to have us bounce quickly in-between all of the classes the students attend. However, it does a good job of introducing us to this world, it has a lot of really memorable moments, a great cast and there's a lot of imagination here (some from the movie, some from the original book), it's a humble beginning to a series of films that's sure to become essential viewing and a lot of people's favourite for years to come.

            "content": "I have mentioned many times that throughout the history of cinema some films have capture the imagination of a generation, and it is undeniable that the saga that had that effect in my generation is J.K.Rowling's \"Harry Potter\", a saga that took a decade to conclude. Did this saga have a solid beginning? \n\nHarry Potter is a 10 year old boy who lives with his abusive uncles, but his pitiful life changes drastically when a tall bearded man reveals to him that he is a wizard and offers to take him to the wizard world where he belongs. The amazed Harry decides to follow this man in order to receive magical education, but little does he know about the dangers of this brand new world. \n \nLet's get something clear: The first 4 chapters of this saga left a big mark on my childhood so undeniably there is going to be a little bit of nostalgia and bias (I'm sorry I can't help it). Every iconic franchise needs a solid beginning in order to build a successful franchise so I am more than happy to report that the first chapter of this saga is a more than solid one. \"Philosopher's Stone\" has enjoyable performances by its adult cast (I particularly love Alan Rickman as Snape) while the child actors try their best and they have their moments but overall it's what you expect from child actors, the CGI has aged well, it has tons of creative ideas, the characters actually have personality and go through some character development, the score is possibly  John Williams' best work of the 21 century (yes, including the prequels), the story itself isn't quite spectacular but still is filled with solid and creative ideas, the production design is jaw dropping, and its entertainment value is quite high. But regardless of my nostalgia, now I see the problems I didn't when I saw this in theaters. Chris Columbus direction is extremely bland that it feels like the film is on autopilot as he just filmed pages of the book but without adding any new substance (this truly was the perfect project for Terry Gilliam), the script could have use some rewrites as it has many unnecessary scenes that are just there for world building (I get that you need to do that in your first installment of a new world but you can do that on the first act), the ending desperately needed more detail, and it has major pacing issues. \n\n\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" manages to introduce viewers to a creative world that has capture the imagination of an entire generation (myself included in said generation) and could do the same for the upcoming ones, regardless of the pacing issues. A captivating, charming and highly enjoyable start for a saga that has potential.",

Stylistically, this film is as bland as they come.  This is somewhat excusable, seeing as how it's the first attempt and the filmmakers had to have been somewhat unsure of the best way to interpret such a popular and beloved book series.  The series' target audience definitely hasn't been pinpointed quite yet, and director Chris Columbus really doesn't know what he's doing.  That shouldn't come as a surprise to any of us, though.

This film has a tone that is hard to find in most other child friendly films. \r\nThe first time i saw this film I was 12 years old and I remember it filling me with a sense of joy similar to the first time that I saw The Wizard of OZ. In a lot of ways both films area similar, the protagonist gets taken into a magical world that is both filled with Excitement and Danger. Both protagonists also meet a group of friends who help them along their journey. At the end of their journey both of the protagonist learn something about themselves and how important it is to have people who care about you. Sure that may seem naive now when most films are filled with cynicism, but I think more films could use a bit of it.\r\n\r\nThe three young actors in this film are lacking in the 'acting' department but it is not so bothersome because they are surrounded by A-list actors who know what they are doing. The CGI may be dated now but it does not detract from the overall magical affect of the movie.\r\n\r\nOverall the small problems in this film are not enough to deter my love for this film.

On the other hand, because there are no risks taken, there are scenes that seem arbitrary; there was little creative license taken.

But what I can say is the first film is a pretty good one with lots interesting secrets and some pretty funny moments here and there. I would deffinatly reccomend this film (fan or not) cause it just has a lot to offer. However there is one big issue I had with this film and that was its plot. Now the plot of this film was simply about the sorcers stone and the movie dosent really feel like that at most times in this film. Most of the time it just feel like Harry's just trying to get used to his new life as being a wizard and going to Hogwarts. That wouldn't be a big problem if this film would talk about the main story just as much. But instead this movie became very boring because the plot wasn't a big prank of this movie. Now one thing I also loved about this movie was the ending because I loved how they had to face all these diffrent magical obsticals and finally get to the main villian. Now even thoe the main villian was pretty easy to beat I liked who he was cause it was pretty surprising and you had a fair share at figuring out who he or she was. So overall no real big issues other than the main plot (the scorchers stone) should have been a bigger part of this movie. Also one more thing I loved about this film is the fact that it felt like we (the audience) were going to Hogwarts for the first time and that can be very hard to pull off but this movie did it very well. So I do reccomend it.",
