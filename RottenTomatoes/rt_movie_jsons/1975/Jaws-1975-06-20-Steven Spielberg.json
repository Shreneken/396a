    "summary": "When a young woman is killed by a shark while skinny-dipping near the New England tourist town of Amity Island, police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches, but mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) overrules him, fearing that the loss of tourist revenue will cripple the town. Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled ship captain Quint (Robert Shaw) offer to help Brody capture the killer beast, and the trio engage in an epic battle of man vs. nature.",

What made this so great was that you didn't see the actual shark until the last third of the movie. It keeps you guessing and forming an image of this monster. It makes it a lot scarier. The characters are simple yet effective and you care for everyone. The dialogue is very natural and doesn't feel forced and on top of that, the cast all give great performances. This is a near perfect movie and I had a fantastic time rewatching this.",

And even if you hear the music you instantly know what's about to happen. From the documentaries I have seen before, this movie has people lined down the block just to see it at the theatres yet the box office record doesn't add up to today's movies such as Avatar and Avengers End Game, but back then, movie tickets didn't cost so much. I think it would be really cool if they would also announce how much tickets have been sold aswell. Maybe 5 seats sold is equivalent to 2 seats with today's prices. \n\nthis is actually a great movie. One thing is that I actually find really cool about this movie is that there is so many moments that actually is quite awkward especially it's dialogue because conversations in real are never perfect and once you start to realise how perfect conversations are in movies it sounds more scripted. And this movie has so many moments that the way the conversation starts or flows isn't typical, especially when most noticeable when Matt comes over to the chief's house for dinner. There is also so many scenes that relies on reaction to the characters or their actions, there is even moments when something is being said and an answer isn't given immediately. The cinematography is really amazing, alot of light in the beach which for me was kind of odd but then over time I got used to it. For the date this movie was released it's still amazing. The sound in this movie is absolutely great even though while one person is talking other people is taking aswell just as loud which is another reason why it's imperfections actually make it better. Even though the shark wasn't seen as much because when they made the movie, they had problems with the mechanical shark, it doesn't feel like as it did in the new Godzilla movie. This is still one of my favorite movies",

The effects are stunning, the acting is phenomenal, the story is enticing, and the execution is great.\n\nThe movie starts with two teens trying to enjoy a late-night swim and the girl falls victim to the shark in one of the most iconic deaths of all cinema.  We cut to morning and one of my favorite film characters, Chief Brody, is introduced.  He ends up investigating the strange death and deduces it was a shark.  But Mayor Larry Vaughn does not approve because he wants to make money off of the tourists.\n\nThis situation spirals into Brody, an ichthyologist named Hooper, and a shark hunter named Quint going out into the sea on the Orca after the giant beast.  The scenes with them bonding as a group are great and hilarious, and the recounting of the USS Indianapolis' sinking by Quint probably displays the best acting and writing of the whole film.\n\nAll in all, this is an incredible movie.  The deaths are great, as is the acting and story.  One of my favorite movie villain deaths of all time comes in the form of Chief Brody shooting the oxygen tank in the shark's mouth and blowing him up.  I also have massive respect for everyone involved behind the scenes because this movie was a tough one to make, but I'm sure glad they came through.  Also, John Williams never ceases to make iconic scores.",

Little later the sharl returns and eats a dog and Alex Kitner (Jeffrey Voorhees) to then when it seems that the shark was caught. But nope it's the wrong shark. Other highlights are Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfus) as the shark expert knowing that probably the tiger shark wasn't the real thing. Quint (Robert Shaw) easily is one of the best characters. One of the best emotional points of the film is when Quint gives his USS Indianapolis speech. Spielberg's suspense is second to none. The amazing theme from John Williams, Verna Fields the editor. They all make this film and I don't use this word lightly this film is a masterpiece, perfect. 100/10 if you haven't seen this film I would drop whatever your doing and watch this film",

I remember yelling at the tv to go back and get a bigger boat! And when quint smashed the radio I was screaming at him right along with chief Brody! Watched it in IMAX on cinema day for only $3!  When the chief blew up jaws aka Bruce it sounded like and explosion happened in the theater. Shook the chairs. Now onto witness this masterpiece in 3D!  The guy sitting next to me said “ that was a hella good movie” he said it was his first time watching and he had to be around my age. What I’d give to be able to see this for the first time everytime I watched it 😆🤷‍♂️. Best movie EVER made. Wish they’d go back to filmmaking like this and leave all the over done CGI out of cinema.  Spielberg you da man!",

This movie is a good structure and is interesting.\n                                  \n     This movie has been well aged till now in days because it would still be interesting to the audience. This can be shown in one of the most interesting parts of the movie, by the end of the movie no one would imagine it would end with the shark exporting and one of the main men dying. This movie is not well aged to 2022 because of the negligees shown and how it can affect a large group of people. A big example of negligees in the movie is when the police notice the mayor of the shark on the beach and he refuses to close it down. If a  situation like that was to happen now in day the actions token would be very different. One of my favorite characters is the chief Martin Brody. The special effects are a little outdated, but I believe this makes you terrible throw time. I personally truly dislike mayor Larry because he does not show\n any type of care for the town. The whole nature vs man can be really interesting to many people and mysterious.\n\n           Overall this movie is really interesting and can be a fun favorite when it comes to nature vs men. The structure of the movie makes some of the characters almost mysterious so we don't know what they would do next. I would give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars because everything is interesting but some of the actings can be unprofessional.",

Definitely the first of its kind and beautifully done by Steven Spielberg. \n\n Does the movie hold up in 2022? Yes, there are many aspects of the film that I say can pass today's cinematic standards. The music is a big part that I want to speak on, the legendary soundtrack by John Carpenter certainly holds up today, the suspense it adds to each attack makes it even more terrifying . The Story plot is the one of the main parts that make this film a classic, the idea of a 20 foot long great white terrorizing and going on a killing spree is the first of its kind. The acting is definitely also a highlight of this film, the death scenes were so realistic, the two most realistic points were the opening scene with one of most terrifying and realistic frantic screams ever and the ending with Quints gruesome bloody death. \n\n\nAspects of the film that I think would not pass today's standards . The end of the film, the ending seems rushed and not clearly thought out, like how the shark flops its head up on the deck of the boat and eats Quint when Hooper was just hiding in the water? Actually there were multiple points in the film that Hooper could have been killed another time was when he and Brody went out on Hooper's boat where they found the mangled ship, in this scene Hooper came face to face with the  shark. Regarding the shark prop, after the shark devours Quint and goes for Broady, the shark crashes through the glass window of the sinking boat,then you get a close up of the rubbery fiberglass prop, which sets off the terrifying scene. The shark prop would definitely not stand up to today's CGI effects. \n\n\nIn the question of does \"Jaws\" hold up to 2022, I believe it could, the acting and story and the directing all together create a timeless classic some consider one of Steven Spielberg's greatest. This question is very argumentative on both sides.\n\n\nI would recommend this to anyone in search of a good thriller/horror film, I would not suggest this film to someone who does not enjoy gory death scenes and someone looking for a super effects filled movie. \n\n\nOut of five stars I would rate this film a four out of five.",

            "content": "It's a beautiful summer night on the great vacation island of Amity Island. You decide you want to take a night swim then while you are 100 yards out, BOOM shark attack, you're gone. For this being a movie made in the 70's I feel like it holds up extremely well and was very entertaining 50 years later. A killer shark swims into town and is gifted with a summer feast with all of the swimmers, and boaters. After the first attack the chief fights with the mayor to shut down the beaches. The mayor declines due to it being so close to the 4th of July, and what is a vacation destination for if not to be open on the 4th of July. More attacks happen and the chief calls in a shark specialist, Hooper, to help. A shark hunter, Captain Quint, also comes to town with a hefty price to kill the shark. After more attacks the mayor agrees to pay the fee to kill the shark. The three set sail to kill the shark once and for all. After days of hunting, and battling, and opening up to each other, the final battle ensues and while Jaws did get one last dinner by eating Captain Quint, Chief Brody gets the job done and blows the shark up at the last possible second as the ship is sinking. \n   Did this movie hold up in 2022? I think it did. I think while the special effects, camera work, and even some of the acting have been vastly improved through the years it is still a good movie and very watchable and enjoyable in 2022. I think the plot of the movie holds up extremely well, there have been many shark movies since Jaws and they are all either trying to copy Jaws or just don't live up to the plot of Jaws. Some of the parts that don't \"hold up\" are the special effects, and camera quality. I put hold up in quotes because that is unfair to say hold up when technology has improved over the 50 years since this movie was made, so comparing it to movies in 2022 it will lose that battle but for its time some of the effects were very special and rare. The shark doesn't look good compared to today as I'm sure it was made out of paper mache or something like that while today you can CGI anything you want so it is unfair to compare. So I would say they are in between holding up or not, they have been very outmatched but it doesn't really take away from the viewing experience for me. The not so great effects of the shark almost make it better for me, a bit more cheesy and funny. Seeing the head of the shark pop up as it eats the guy on the kayak, and then when it is almost all the way on the boat eating Captain Quint it just adds a funny part to the movie even if it isn't supposed to do that it adds to the experience for me. The thing I disliked the most was some scenes that had seemingly random cuts to black screens then cut back to basically the same scene. One example was when everyone was at the docks looking at the shark they had caught and everyone thought it was over.  The chief was talking to Hooper and the Mayor and then it cut and the black screen appeared and then it just basically changed camera angles. It didn't need that cut to the black screen. It switched to him and Hooper still talking but the family of one of the children who died coming from the funeral and the mother slaps him blaming him for her child's death. Normally I feel like those cuts are used if you are changing time or changing to a whole new event, not just switching  from one camera angle to another. This happened a few other times and really stuck out to me. \n   If they did a shot for shot, line for line remake just with improved cameras, and special effects I think it would come out and be the number one movie for a long time. Most shark attack movies try to copy plot or story lines from Jaws, and that is because it holds up and is still so popular to this day. I would urge everyone to watch this film because I had never seen it, but I knew how everyone said it was good but I would think ‘It's from the 70s will I actually enjoy it?' The answer was yes I did enjoy it, and if you are like me and like action movies with lots of killing then you will enjoy this movie too. I rate it 4 out of 5 stars.",

Honestly, I thought the movie was pretty good, and I can see why it's pretty popular even after all these years.\n\nThe movie absolutely holds up in 2022, despite having been made almost 50 years ago. One of my favorite scenes was when Captain Quint got killed by Bruce (the shark) and blood splattered everywhere. This scene, despite showing the rubber shark, looks so cool even today. This is all without me mentioning that Captain Quint is my favorite character, so his death is still pretty sad. I also really enjoyed the different ways the characters tried to fight the shark, such as Captain Quint harpooning it with the yellow barrels to chase after it and eventually Hooper scuba diving to try and fight it himself. Despite all this, some flaws still appear, as in all movies. An obvious one being how in some scenes, Bruce the Shark looks unrealistic. Everyone has said this a thousand and one times, but it's just true. Another part is how the town dealt with the shark attacks. Nowadays, people can just call an organization and easily let them deal with it, but it's also understandable since Amity Island seems pretty lonely.\n\nOverall, I can definitely say you will like this movie if you're into suspense and blood. While it isn't bloody, there are scenes where blood is heavily shown. I really enjoyed the movie and can see why everyone thinks it's amazing.",

For me I'd have to say the movie was pretty good especially to be made in the 1970's, but just like every movie, it has flaws.\n\n       I like the movie but if it was made in 2022 no one would watch it because the effects are not good AT ALL. The fact that it was made in 1972 is a crutch and they didn't have the technology that we use today. The quality was bad and the way the shark was biting quint was really unrealistic. I also think that a lot of the acting was terrible and sometimes awkward. There are a lot of things they did good though, the scene when quint and the research guy were drunk and speaking really really vivid. I also liked the iconic sound that they use when jaws is near and will most likely get his next kill. One other bad thing about the movie is the time it took for them to go out to sea to finally kill Jaws. \n\n            In conclusion, as a person that is  used to watching high quality movies and great CGI, Jaws isn't that bad. I'd rate the movie about 3.5/5 stars. I think if the movie would be remade and the affects, acting and CGI were redone in current time, Jaws would get at least a ⅘ stars from me.",

Later on a hunt for the great white shark started. In 2022, Jaws does not hold up much. The movie is great but considering special effects, graphics, actors, and budget. The movie isn't caught up with these things since in modern times, all production, studios, etc. are new and improved. Like in Quint's death scene the shark looks like an animatronic and some might not like that idea added into the movie. For a movie made in 1975 I'd say it was a good movie, everything in this movie is a cinematic constructed horror adventure. As a whole the movie is good but isn't enough to hold up during these times, but If you're interested in action and horror this movie will be a good pick. I'd rate the film a 4.5/5.",

            "content": "A classic film loved by many, Jaws follows the hunt for a bloodthirsty shark and his explosive demise. As Amity is on the menu, a massive great white must be stopped by a rag-tag group consisting of a police chief, a marine biologist, and an old boat captain. As famous as this story of a small town vs. a sea monster is, it has lost the respect it once deserved. Between the poor cinematography, and poor animatronics, Jaws is a tale that should follow in the footsteps of Bruce.\nJaws is far from the worst movie of its time, and that's shown in how well much of the dialog holds up. The characters are often funny such as Brody trying to be a seaman. He's awful at tying knots, he doesn't know anything about boats, and he constantly complains, but it's amusing to see the shift in tone as for once Brody is acting immature and isn't the center of attention. We can also see excellent misdirection in the 4th of July scene. Not only is the fin hidden just enough it tricks the viewer into thinking they noticed a small detail, it's just two kids and takes the viewer off edge before the surprise attack in the pond. This first glance of the shark makes the animatronic look very impressive, but unfortunately it is the only time the infamous shark looks remotely convincing. \nFrom this point onwards, Bruce is never fearsome. While he has a few surprising jumpscares, I've seen paper mache look more convincing. Then as Quint is locked in his jaws, we get a wonderful long view of the shark animatronic. No longer is this a fearsome sea beast as the villain appears more as a latex children's toy, and moves in such a basic way it's predictable, it's not frightening, and it's boring. While I understand the difficulty in working with electronics in the water, let alone on that scale, the shark presented closes the movie looking unrealistic and as unnerving as a kitten compared to earlier on in the movie.\nOverall, Jaws is not a poor movie, but it shows its age. You can clearly see this movie was made in the 70s with a 70s standard, and 70s technology. You will like Jaws if you can ignore the effects of a movie and get involved in the story. Jaws will make you wonder where the unseen beast is and had me on the edge of my seat wanting more than the glimpse of a fin, and supported by such an amazing soundtrack that is just another incredibly well known work of art by John Williams. However, if like me, you value the visual appeal of the movie and the realistic characters and setting drawing you in, much of this movie's appeal will be dragged away like a skinny dipping teen.",

One part of the movie that can hold up  was the opening scene. Chrissie Watkins was a young adult who was swimming in the ocean when she got attacked gruesomely. In this scene her body was flinging around while she was fighting to get away. The acting was great, because it was, to an extent, realistic. One part that wouldn't hold up was the ending. Quint's death didn't look realistic, because the shark itself looked really fake in that scene, because the teeth looked rubber and the body of the shark looked soft rather than realistically rough.",

This alone raises the film up ½* for me - it's impressively made.\n\nI don't, personally, think the story is as perfect as the aforementioned. Don't get me wrong it's all entertaining, but I feel it peaks with the shark terrorising the town as a whole - when it's down to just the trio, I didn't enjoy it quite as much. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss do give notable performances, though.\n\nGoing back to my initial point, the effects for the shark are incredible. I kinda wanted to simply see more of just the shark, even if we do get more of the great white towards the conclusion. Heck, the film from the shark's prospective would've been 5*. Lastly, that John Williams score is sensational - I think every film fan, whether they've seen it or not, knows that famous theme.\n\nAlmost 47 years after its release, I've finally seen 'Jaws'. I don't honestly think the story/the characters itself are anything out of this world, but there's so much to admire and praise from a technical aspect. A marvel, really.",

Once they start to grow that brotherly bond, though, the main trio is really engaging to watch.\n\nThe practical effects are really impressive for the most part, although it looks a bit awkward when too much of the shark is shown at once (a standard problem for \"vintage\" creature features). Also, I think I might be a little desensitized to this sort of thing, but the shark honestly didn't look all that big to me 🤷 I guess it probably seemed pretty huge at the time!\n\nThe writing is solid and it balances its scientific (almost sci-fi) plot with an exciting finale to make an impressively engaging film.",

It weaves together the conventions of disaster movies which were big at the time; horror-thrillers like Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds; and adventure stories like Moby Dick.  Spielberg's ace in the hole has always been expertly mounting action set-pieces.  He is the master and he does not disappoint here.  (The original director was fired at the direction of author Peter Benchley who didn't like that he pitched to him a scene about a \"whale\").  Spielberg grounds the stories with characters we love and understand; this is not a trashy potboiler ala Peyton Place like the book was; the movie's u exploitive realism in the land scenes in Amity expertly sets off the over-the-top action scenes.  The acting from Dreyfus, Scheider and Shaw is also superb; all working at the top of their form; the palpable tension between Shaw and Dreyfus (which was quite real!) sets off sparks: and also helps to ground and realize the shark-kill scenes.  And John Williams visceral driving score is a masterwork!\n\nThe realism level is low here; great white sharks don't actually stalk and kill people; they eat minnows; this was actually inspired by the true story of a rogue TIGER shark which are much more dangerous.  And the number of deaths committed by all sharks pales in comparison in any given year to the amount of people killed by dogs, crocodiles or hippos for example.  (Or being bitten by disease-ridden mosquitos or being hit by a car; etc.) Man's primal and overweening fear of the shark is a somewhat irrational one mostly built on tall tales and legends like this one.  \n\nBut the movie definitely works when you're watching it; one of the best adventure-thrillers of all time!",

Even with the shark that doesn't look realistic by today's standards, Jaws still delivers the suspense and the terror and is a textbook study on how to escalate tension for a maximum payoff.\n\nIn terms of acting, the chemistry between Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw is a delight to take in.

            "content": "Jaws Movie Review\nDid you know sharks kill an average of 10 people a year, worldwide?\nNow, imagine eight shark kills in a single week!  Yesterday, I watched a Steven Spielberg classic, Jaws. Jaws is about a killer Great White Shark that is attacking swimmers off the coast of a fictional island called Amity, which is off the coast of New England.\nThe acting is great, with many award winning actors, including Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw.\nRoy Sheider plays Martin Brody, the star of the movie, and the local sheriff of Amity. Martin is from New York, but moves to Amity with his family because he feels that in a small town, he has more of an impact on preventing crime.\n\"'I'm tellin' ya, the crime rate in New York will kill ya. There's so many problems, you never feel like you're accomplishing anything. Violence, rip-offs, muggings. The kids can't leave the house. You gotta walk 'em to school. But in Amity, one man can make a difference. In twenty-five years, there's never been a shooting or a murder in this town.\" Quote from Martin Brody. \nAn ironic detail about Martin Brody is that he is afraid of the water, even though he is the one (spoiler alert!) who kills the shark in the end. \nRichard Dreyfuss plays a leading role as an oceanographer named Matt Hooper, who specializes in sharks, and helps track down the shark.\nRobert Shaw plays Quint, a professional shark hunter, who is strange but entertaining. He has a leading role in helping to kill the shark.\nThe special effects in Jaws were not entirely accurate, but are still exceptionally impressive for a 1975 movie, and can even hold up to today's standards, as well as the rest of the movie.\nThe suspense in Jaws is incredible, and the ominous, trademark, Jaws soundtrack plays every time the shark goes in for the kill.\nIn my opinion, Jaws is an absolute masterpiece, because of it's great suspense, colorful characters, and awesomely gory kills. It has an excellent plot, nail biting suspense, and most importantly, never has a dull moment. Jaws is surprisingly scary for such an old movie, and ages like fine wine.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI have been watching movies since I was 3, starting with Disney, all the way up to movies like Scream and The Bourne Identity. I have always loved raving, complaining, and watching movies. My family and I have had a Friday night movie night, and I have watched upwards of 350 movies.",

Many people refused to go in the water the summer this film came out due to the fear that lingered long after they left the theater.

Roy Scheider was made to be the Island Sheriff with a fear of the water.    A young Richard Dreyfuss brought humor and charm to the film.  However, it was Robert Shaw, playing a modern Captain Ahab, that was most memorable.

The audience is seeing like the shark and together with the music (the soundtrack of the film) puts a kind of anxiety of the type \"the shark is going to kill anybody?\". But later all this feeling disappears with the coldness of the image change. \nAt minute 15 there is a tranquility which puts anxiety, the people were swimming with a probably shark? But why? This people are so dumb, and when the police want to close the beaches they come angry. Ohh, it was for your security. \nThe people are a kind of sheep because when the shark attacks, EVERYTIME, all of these go for see the shark, sometimes risking their lives, so no comment. \nSpeaking of \"risking their life\", all people know the shark's attacks, but they go swim anyway, what is in their mind? Ash? \nIn conclusion I liked the word used by Hooper \"eating machine\" because I think it describes in excellent manners the shark and the story which revolves around him. \nThank you for reading so far :)",

Jaws also have a revolutionary score by John Williams and it was one of the first Spielberg, William duo. we follow the story of a small tourist island that is getting attacked by a giant shark and three people on a boat go and hunt the beast and those 3 fishermen are Martin brody, Matt Hooper, and Sam quint. the first half of the movie is a horror movie with a haunting suspenseful score and the second half is an action and adventure film with a more upbeat film. the first half is set on amity where chrisse Watkins and Alex Kitner gets attacked by a shark. Kitner's mom puts up a $3000 bounty on the shark that killed Alex Kitner and of course, a bunch of crazies starts trying to kill the shark and they caught it!... they thought hooper talks some science stuff and says that not the shark. later that night hooper gets the chief drunk and they go to check out the shark...It was the wrong shark who could have imagined. they go on to a boat and see a boat and one of the best jumpscares happens when ben gardeners dead body just pops up and scares a tooth out of hoopers hand. The next day at the beach two kids prank the very populated beach of amity but then there's a real shark Michal Brody is on a boat with his friends and there's another guy there and boom shark attack! Michael goes in shock and while at the doctor brody gets the mayor to sign the contract for quint. brody hooper and quint go on the boat and shark just kinda toys with them for the rest of the runtime. hooper is sick of the shark and goes into the cage to stab it with a poison needle but the shark goes attacks the back of the cage and scares the hooper he drops his poison thing evruntlly he get out the cage and hides behind a rock and they show some awesome footage of a real-life shark getting caught in a cage nobody was hurt during the real-life footage thankfully. quint and brody pull up the cage and the shark leaps out of the water and onto the flooding boat and nom noms on quint. brody is stuck on the boat and the shark tries to eat the man but he gives the beast an oxygen tank instead and gets a gun and shoots at the shark when Smile you son of a b***h! BOOM the sharks blows up. hooper rises and they swim back to the shore the end waits.. jaws 2? jaws 3  and jaws the revenge! what alright that's the review for now",

In my opinion Spielberg should have won several Oscar's before he finally won it in 1993 for Schindler's list. ET should have won best picture and director and close encounters should have won some major Oscar's too. Also Indiana Jones and raiders of the lost ark and last crusade were better than any movie made the same year they were made, so he deserved some more credit than he got for those.

I also feel the helplessness the people being attacked feel because of the disadvantage that they are at in the water and how hopeless it is getting away from an aquatic animal in the water. This movie also makes me freak out every time anybody steps into the water. What I marvel at most though is the firs time you see the shark underwater. We all know how unrealistic the shark looks outside the water. I am not to thrilled with the first time you see its head outside the water.

The film that propelled Steven Spielberg to fame is a terrifying suspenseful film filled with incredible characters, a hell of a dialogue, and masterful direction. Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw create one of cinema's most memorable trios with incredible characterization and comradery. The script is excellent with a dialogue that has become iconic. But is Spielberg's direction where he does not show the shark who is the star of the film that creates images of sheer terror and suspense that keeps us on the edge. The shark still terrifies years later and was mechanical but feels real. Finally one of the most terrifying scores in cinema by John Williams signifies the theme of the shark and it creates suspense and fear in the audience. Jaws is simply a masterpiece, a movie that supersedes its time and has become iconic because it's simply a work of art. One of the best American films.",

I'm not afraid of sharks, but this film definitely makes you appreciate one of the most savage creatures of the sea. This is one of my favorite Richard Dreyfuss films, he's convincing and at times humorous. My favorite scene is where Quint, the actor Robert Shaw, talks about the USS Indianapolis... In my opinion, one of the best scenes in movie history. Roy Schneider was a match made for his role, and I don't think anyone could have done it better.

Of the numerous classic pictures directed by Spielberg, Jaws remains his masterpiece.",

A decisão de mostrar o tubarão em poucos momentos é assertiva e aumenta a curiosidade/suspense do mesmo.\n\nOs personagens são excelentes. É muito fácil se por na pele deles, até mesmo do prefeito visto todo o contexto que aqui é dado sobre o povo americano - principalmente no sentido de que o mesmo é o reflexo deles. falando sobre a caçada ao tubarão: ela é interessante. Acredito que alguns momentos foram longos demais, mas talvez essa sensação se dê porque eu estava começando a ficar com sono. O \"gore\" do filme me pareceu um pouco perdido, visto que o filme tem uma pegada sessão da tarde quando prestamos atenção na OST. O tema é magnifico e emblemático, mas o conjunto de musicas subsequentes deixa um pouco a desejar na proposta do longa, na minha opinião.",

            "content": "The plot has a great white shark is attacking swimmers and boaters off the shores of Amity, which is getting ready for the July 4th tourist weekend.  The police chief (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beach, but the mayor (Murray Hamilton) doesn't want the beaches closed because the town makes all of its money during the summer season.  I had no idea when I started watching this movie that it would have elements of today's pandemic – trying to balance health safety versus economy.  It's a main thread in the first hour of the movie and it goes horribly wrong due to poor choices.  I sure hope it does not portend the same for our country's current situation.\n\nBack to the plot.  The police chief is finally allowed to hire a shark hunter (played by the amazing actor Robert Shaw) and they along with a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) head out in search of the man-eating enemy.  The last hour focuses on this great sea adventure, which includes lots of chatter between the three characters and some terrific action sequences.\n\nI have not watched \"Jaws\" since I was a teenager – mainly because I remember the boat scenes where the three main characters were hunting the shark were long, wordy and boring.  I'm sorry I waited this long to watch this movie again because what I find now in my 50s is that Stephen Spielberg knew how to make films although I still found those hunting scenes a bit too long.  In terms of movie making though, early on in the film, Spielberg loves to play with multiple conversations going on at the same time, which I did not recall from watching it back in the 1980s.  It's kind of a nifty technique that brings layers of dialogue to the story.  It was one of his early films, but you can tell he had talent even back then.\n\n\"Jaws\" is a fairly tense thriller although the mechanical shark does pale in comparison to what today's computer-generated efforts would be able to produce on film.  I thought it would be dated, but a man-eating shark story never really ages.  I wouldn't watch it the night before going to the beach though.  You won't get in the water.",

This movie has one of the most iconic scores by John Williams and he is becoming one of my favorite composers of all time and this has one of my favorite scores of all time and it just creeps up on you and then hits and it feels amazing. Old movies like these are so authentic with the audio and the film it really is different from other movies made nowadays. People had to be scared when they were watching this because there were no shark movies and it was in the summer so they had to be scared out of their minds with I love when a movie does that it makes it so much better. I love the shark pov they add and I don't know if other shark films do it but I love the shot and I hope other films do it. This movie has so many iconic lines like \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\", and iconic characters like the Mayor and Cheif Brody, and the amazing iconic score that is so haunting by John Williams. It is very rare that a film creates cliches and troupes like this film for a whole genre and the main reason why these films create cliches and troupes is because they are amazing and some of the best films ever created and it was so successful it made a whole genre that blows my mind. Steven Spielberg is becoming one of my favorite directors of all time, I love what he does with each of his films and I am excited to see what he does with his new musical film West Side Story. There were a few jump scares that actually got me and I forgot there were jump scares besides when the shark jumps on the boat. This is such a simple story about a team trying to kill a shark but they make it complicated for the better of the story and I love it. This film really holds up with today's films and I was surprised by that a lot. One of the most iconic shots of all time and one of my favorite shots is in this movie when they do a dolly zoom which is when you zoom in or out while tracking the camera forward or backwards I absolutely love that shot so much and it was first made by Alfred Hitchcock who is one of if not the best director of all time. One thing I have heard of is that the animatronic shark was so hard to work with it even almost cost them the entire movie and they had to repaint it each time they used it which blows my mind they got this movie made. I love the ending so much and it is one of the endings that paid off so much besides the ending to Return Of the King that paid off a lot.\n\nLike I said before the score is absolutely one of the best of all time and I love it so much. The cinematography is amazing to the shark pov which I love and the shot placements I love so much. I'm actually surprised that it didn't get nominated for an oscar the cinematography is actually really good. The editing mixed with the cinematography is amazing in this film and those are two of my favorite element of filmmaking which those both contribute to the theme and story of the film which I love. The acting is actually really good in this film I thought it would be a hit or miss but it is very very good I don't know why I doubted it. I love the writing and the dialogue in this film and it is so iconic because it works for this film and it just so amazing. The sound editing and mixing really holds up with today's films which is amazing. I love the tension and the suspense they create and adding the amazing score really makes those tension and suspense-filled scenes amazing. Overall I absolutely love this movie and would recommend it to anyone.\n💯%",

            "content": "The birth of the summer blockbuster, Jaws is a tense psychological thriller that, for the most part, lives up to the hype. As a story, Jaws is kind of basic. The writing itself takes no real liberties to differentiate it from any other film of the time, but what made Jaws stand out was the way everything is shot. The scenes filmed from the shark's perspective are probably some of the most iconic shots in Hollywood. The shots were so impactful that it changed the way I looked at the movie itself. I started looking at those shots of all those people's bare legs on a beach like it was a restaurant menu. Given the technological boundaries, it's miraculous Spielberg managed to pull a movie like Jaws off. Rather than having the actual Jaws animatronic in every shot, the music and angles of the shot tell the story to the audience. This kind of film making is something missing in modern cinema, and it's a shame that it isn't quite this prominent more often. Another thing that is amazing on the technical side of this movie is the way Spielberg worked around the fact that everything was filmed around water. While this was used to the advantage of the film, it also dragged it back some. While the building of the universe in the first act is made quite well. The way that the protagonists beat the shark is prolonged, eventually, I got somewhat tired of it. This kind of movie where the story is mediocre, but the visual and technical aspects are incredibly impactful is the summer blockbuster at its core. While the story was just okay, it's important to understand how important Jaws is to the history of film making.",

The Chief of Police Brody (Roy Schneider) and the Mayor Shaw (Murray Hamilton) are in conflict over whether or not to close the beach due to a recent shark attack. The mayor wins the argument to keep the beach open only for another attack to happen and the adventure begins. As the movie continues more and more attacks happen and the Chief Brody takes matters in his own hand and begins to put together a team that can help him pursue this elusive shark that is threatening the residents and vacationers to this island. The Chief was able to convince a shark expert Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a lifelong shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) to go along with him to hunt down this menace once and for all and take the shark out. In this hunt we see how focused the Chief has become and when he lays eyes on what he is dealing with face to face the real adventure begins. He then realizes he has a formidable adversary and it's going to take a lot more than he thought to take down this creature\nThe success of this movie was due immensely to its time of release and it opened in over 400 movie theaters, up until now no movie had ever opened with such preview buzz thus creating the first of the \"blockbuster\" type movie. This movie was able to take something that is very likely to happen and heighten our awareness of what could happen. This was one of the first movies to take a real set of circumstances and placing man with animal just by going to on vacation and taking a swim. \nThe music and the cinematography played a huge role and letting the audience know just how scary of a creature we were about to encounter up close and personal. The placement of the music within the film was excellent. The music has gone down as one of the most recognizable scores in the history of film. Spielberg put his signature in this film when he created this music that only works with this film. This movie kick started Spielberg's career as one of the top grossing directors in Hollywood and went on to be one of the biggest top grossing films of all time.",

It is based on the novel of the same name by Peter Benchley.\nEven for the time it came out this movie is still entertaining as hell. It's not the most realistic take on a shark, but it tells a revenge story that keeps you engaged.\nIn the film, a giant great white shark attacks beachgoer at a New England summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw).\nYou can't say anything bad about the acting in this movie, especially from the main cast. I was surprised by that given the age of the film. There are only a select few films that I consider both classics and to have good acting.\nSpielberg brilliantly took what could have been a cheesy movie and turned it into a classic that will never be forgotten. Between the acting, directing and the amazing score, this movie is one to be talked about for years to come still.\nOverall, this is yet another master craft from one of the greatest filmmakers out there. Nobody can walk away from watching this movie thinking it could have been better.\n4.5/5",

The way Spielberg directed all of the scenes in this film from the quiet scenes to the scenes where a shark kills someone it is all so well done. I also like all the great ties in these films just thought I should mention it. Another thing I love about this film is the practical effects for Bruce (the shark) even though he do not see him a lot when we do it is weird to think it is all practical, like Terminator this was a time before all the SFX to make all the action scenes fake. This film also a very satisfying conclusion but they did make 3 others which is okay but if you do not watch the other 3 you still feel satisfied with the ending of the first film. In conclusion this is a great film with great direction and practical effects, this film changed cinema forever with everything, it is so good.",

Jaws was the first summer blockbuster- the film that heralded the start of an amazing career of young Steven Spielberg and the one film that single handedly caused beaches to close down that summer. Jaws has two villains. During the first half of the film, the enemy isn't the shark; it's the face of bureaucracy, as personified by the mayor. More concerned with the economic bottom line than with the possibility of someone being injured, Vaughn muzzles Martin, allowing further deaths to occur. While Martin battles Vaughn and his puppets on the town council, the shark lurks in the background, ready to take over the role of antagonist when the mayor gives way. The second half of the film is the classic man against beast, with Jaws representing the rarest of movie monsters - something that exists in the depths of the ocean (albeit typically in smaller dimensions). This, of course, is the clash for which people watch the movie, and it is handled with great skill. ",

            "content": "While I appreciate the historical importance of this film I don't think it holds up to today's entertainment standards and I do not think it is one of the greatest films of all time. Director Steven Spielberg is of course famous for directing countless classic popcorn thrillers with Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) being among the films on his resume. This was the film that launched it all however as it was a smash hit, even earning a Best Picture nomination, after the minimal success of The Sugarland Express (1974). This is not one of my favorite films of 1975 as I prefer Nashville (1975) and Barry Lyndon (1975) but it was certainly the biggest financial hit of the summer.\n\nOn the small island of Amity, hard-nosed police chief Martin Brody, Roy Scheider, begins investigating a case in which a local woman was killed by a shark. He is urged to suppress information about the attack due to the fear that it will hurt the local economy by cutting down the amount of tourism. The shark continues to attack people as tensions rise and Brody teams up with well educated shark hunting enthusiast Matt Hooper, Richard Dreyfuss. The public becomes interested in the case and professional hunter Quint, Robert Shaw, offers to kill the shark for payment. The men all head off together in an attempt to kill the shark and although they initially do not jell they eventually find common ground and are able to take down the shark.\n\nMy biggest issue with almost all films of this type in which we are meant to delight in the gore produced by a vicious villain, in this case a shark, are that the humans being killed by them are lacking in dimension and are therefore very difficult to care about. It's not that Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw have not given fantastic performances in other films but they have so little work with here that it is hard to see them as characters worth investing in. I was unaffected by the sight of random teenagers being ravaged by a shark both because the sight was a little bit ridiculous and because I had no reason to care. At the end of the film I didn't feel like I knew who these characters were and the fact that they survived didn't make me feel triumphant in the way that it should have because they were just a collection of ideas rather than fully formed human beings we could relate to in their terror.\n\nThe most appealing parts of the film come when we see them battle the shark as the score is magnificent, the sequence in which they try to capture the shark is well shot and some of the best lines pop up here. I would argue that the film doesn't do as good a job at setting up as it should as when comparing it to another film that fits into the horror genre and spends the majority of it's time building up suspense, The Shining (1980), I was utterly bored during the first half of the film. All of the technical elements of the film receive recognition and deservingly so because they are impressive now and would have been even more so in 1975 when it was so far ahead of most films of it's type being released.\n\nHad I seen this film in 1975 I would have been more impressed by it as entertainment of it's type would not have previously existed in the form that it does now and I would not have been able to anticipate all of the plot beats. Sure, the film still excites at some moments and it's special effects still stand out as being groundbreaking but I found myself bored more often than not and that left me with time to ponder the shortcomings of the film which lowered it's status in my mind. A film does suffer over time as even one as famous and acclaimed as this doesn't necessarily connect with audiences 44 years later who are so familiar with the media that it has inspired and for me I have to say that I was underwhelmed.",

That isn't to say that this story doesn't play upon old fears as it is from a time long ago, but the story is still interesting enough (and hopefully most are educated enough about its inaccuracies at this point) that it is a fun and scary time with a creature that could exist, but probably (hopefully) doesn't.

            "content": "Las fauces de Steven Spielberg, como muchas películas seminales, son recordadas en momentos y legados. Recordamos momentos que van desde el horroroso sonido del grito de una mujer al desaparecer en un océano, hasta la conmoción de un hijo que hace caras con su padre. Recordamos legados como Jaws asustando a la gente fuera del agua, a los cineastas que inspiró, a las décadas de las colocaciones de \"películas más terroríficas de todos los tiempos\", y (para bien o para mal) la responsabilidad de la película de crear el éxito de taquilla moderno.\n\nDurante los últimos años, hay una serie de momentos que se destacan cada vez que vuelvo a ver Jaws : la Orca , con Quint, Brody y Hooper a bordo, saliendo al mar, enmarcada siniestramente por Spielberg para que parezca que está tragado por la boca abierta y esquelética de un tiburón que cuelga en la casa de Quint. Lo que generalmente se esperaría con ese disparo es una nota amenazante o dos de la puntuación de John Williams para ayudar a la imagen del presagio. En cambio, ese disparo corta a la Orca y Williams, libre de ruidos de dos notas, permite que la música se acumule, se hinche y exhale un tono alegre que hace que JawsSiento que casi está saltando o dejando escapar un suspiro. Esos momentos se han vuelto cada vez más importantes para mí porque marcan el punto de inflexión para que Jaws se convierta en algo ligeramente diferente en su segunda mitad. Concretamente, algo mucho más divertido.\n\nNo es que Jaws no sea divertido en su primera mitad. Es, aunque de una forma más bien parecida a una montaña rusa: disfrute derivado de la tensión y el miedo, intercalados con respiradores breves para permitir las risitas y las sonrisas que alivian los nervios. Sin embargo, cada vez que veo  Jaws ahora, me sorprende que la segunda mitad de la película no sea la mejor parte, sino la que más se entusiasma a Spielberg. Es fácil decir que, debido a nuestro conocimiento del modus operandi post- Jaws de Spielberg , que Ed Howard ( Slant Magazine ) captura perfectamente :\n\n\" ... La aventura masculina de velocidad libre recorre gran parte del trabajo de Spielberg. Es un aspecto clave de Jaws que va de la mano con su horror: la sensación de asombro casi juvenil que es tan reconocible en muchas de las películas de Spielberg y que surge aquí en la forma en que celebra la heroica expedición para atrapar al tiburón ... Spielberg quiere que nos asustemos con su película, pero también quiere que estemos atemorizados y emocionados \".",

The shark looks fake but given the year this was released, it was understandable.

It did an amazing job of setting up a film where this story feels so real and it was terrifying. I credit this film for a lot of things and I appreciate it even to this day. \n\nOne thing great about this film is the story. It builds the story up so well without ever giving ground. It moves at a steady pace and has one of the best villains in the history of villain. I mean, this Great White was and still is one of the most ferocious villains in cinematic history. I think that says a lot to the story telling aspect and how well this film executed that.\n\nLook, I'm not really a sucker for older films. \"Jaws\" is certainly a classic but it's not exactly my cup of tea. It felt like the third act ran a bit too long and I couldn't keep my attention span there. That's not to say the film did bad, because it didn't, but it's not historically what appeals to me.

The acting is great throughout and the trio of Chief Brady, Hooper and Quint have become a fixation of cinema pop culture over the years, primarily because their banter and experience aboard the Orca is what most people remember. And of course the Shark itself which is probably even more scarier than movie monsters because they actually exist.",

            "content": "You will reconsider swimming in ocean waters ever again!\n\nAmerican auteur Steven Spielberg's horror adventure thriller Jaws (1975) holds up even half a century later! Jaws broke new ground as the first blockbuster and it's simply a thrill ride of a massive shark eating swimmers off a beach by a coastal town for 4th of July season. It really is the best movie to watch on Independence Day every year. Endlessly rewatchable and considerably scarier than many modern horror pictures that have tried and failed to capture the fear of what lurks in deep waters compared to Jaws. Producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown helped Spielberg get Jaws made through much documented troubles from getting funding for a fish film to making the enormous physical shark puppet. Steven Spielberg came out the gate swinging with his first major success for his ambitious Jaws. He establishes likable characters with their own flaws and fears before they ever go after the shark.  Jaws may be Spielberg's finest film.\n\nSpielberg's direction is fascinating. Spielberg relies on a magnificent mechanical shark puppet that looks genuinely real to this day. Jaws is all the more scary because of Spielberg trying to do things practically and creatively. He only hints at a shark being present and then stuns you with reveals of teeth and corpses to Jaws fully lunging onto shark to wreak havoc. His love of stories about fatherhood works wonders for Jaws. Brody is a police chief, but also wants to play with his son, yet harshly scolds him and abandons his family on one level to go after the shark. \n\nSpielberg's entire filmography is all about fatherhood, parenting, and abandonment issues. Jaws sets all that up beautifully. Spielberg lets you get to know this coastal police chief with a childhood trauma that leads to his fear of water, an eager oceanographer with a childhood fascination with sharks, a salty sea captain with a lust for fishing giant fish at all costs, to the greedy mayor thinking only of profits over the lives of his citizens and visitors getting eaten in shark infested waters.\n\nRoy Scheider is fantastic as calm and rational Police Chief Martin Brody. His increasingly paranoid fear of the shark is hilarious, while he is also sympathetic as he's merely trying to keep his town and family safe. Scheider plays a loving husband, tough police chief, politely mannered, and endearing horror hero. Roy is a genius actor. I love watching Scheider portray Brody. I will go to my grave saying Roy Scheider should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for Jaws.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss' cocky scientist Matt Hooper is funny with his cavalier personality and cathartic frustrations with ignorant locals and officials not listening to science. His young confident sailor and aspiring scientist with shark expertise is a fabulous foil for Robert Shaw. Shaw's surly fisherman Quint with his rough aesthetic and crazy personality is captivating. His monologue about the U.S.S. Indianapolis' sailing crew getting eaten by sharks before his eyes is haunting. Shaw is likable despite his hardened manner and blunt speech. He should have gotten an Oscar honestly for Jaws.\n\nMurray Hamilton's cowardly Mayor Larry Vaughn is so funny and pathetic as he callously lets his citizenry and vacationers die on his watch. Lorraine Gary is very nice, supportive, and concerned as Roy's wife Ellen Brody. Lee Fierro is quite moving as Mrs. Kintner, who loses her son. I'm always stunned when she confronts Chief Brody since he kept the beaches open even after knowing a young lady was killed by a shark a week prior.\n\nVisually, Jaws is probably Spielberg's most striking picture. From the interesting fast zoom to a close-up shot of Roy Scheider's shocked facial expression on the beach after a shark attack to the beautiful backdrop of calm waters that are hiding a dangerous aquatic predator. Jaws is so stylish and cool. Cinematographer Bill Butler gets creative with when he'll just show a shark fin, Jaws' face, or his entire fish body. I like how the camera often takes the shark's perspective in the water approaching a boat or victim. He builds suspense from the water to the ports. He uses all these enthralling close-ups as the actors get to monologue that really captivated me. I always love when films focus on their characters rather than just the story.\n\nBestselling novelist Peter Benchley is the author of his book Jaws as well as the screenplay writer for Spielberg's film. I love Benchley's deep characterizations of these men with their own strong personalities and defined motivations for seeking out this shark. A police chief trying to protect his community, a father protecting his family, as well as Brody wants to redeem himself out of guilt after allowing a little boy to get eaten by Jaws when he kept the beaches open at the mayor's demand. I like Benchley harshly critiquing the cowardly mayor's politicking and profiteering as the bodies pile up for fish food. Benchley's social commentary is brilliant in Jaws.\n\nI appreciate that Benchley later regretted writing Jaws as it created the social hysteria to kill sharks en masse and be afraid of these majestic creatures of the sea. He kindly became a shark conservationist to help keep sharks alive and not endangered. Screenplay writer Carl Gottlieb helped adapt Jaws with knowledge of scuba diving, fishing, and marine life besides compelling dramatic storytelling. There's even a progressive science and fact based rationale versus the superstitions and local hysteria on a thematic level. What a fantastic story Jaws is with scary shark sightings and attacks like we've never seen before or since Jaws nailed it. These relatable characters ground Jaws on land before we set out to sea in search of sharks. Jaws' real scares, colorful characters, startling direction, and charismatic acting lead to it remaining a timeless horror thriller. It is part social commentary, while ending up a full blown horror film. Jaws knows how to establish its world quickly and thoroughly, then blast you with fearsome imagery.\n\nComposer John Williams wrote a legendary score for Jaws. His tense music is practically another character. It sets the tone for each moment. From his half step main theme for Jaws to his explosive rush of melodies for the visceral shark attacks. You will be on the edge of your seat as Williams' symphony tears into you like Jaws himself. Williams shows you what less is more means when his simplistic yet effective score chimes in suddenly. Jaws' score contributes intensity and atmosphere. John Williams' compositions for Jaws are as iconic and scary as horror movie soundtracks get. Sound designers John R. Carter and Robert L. Hoyt creates water flowing sound effects to the shark biting down or loudly ramming the ship noises to add to Jaws' fearsome nature.\n\nEditor Verna Fields's sharp cuts keeps the world's first blockbuster afloat and enthralling for 124 minutes of aquatic horror with one giant fish alongside compelling human drama. Going from the shark perspective to the victim is a neat editing choice that defines Jaws' cutting edge style. The conversations are cut to let the actors simply talk without incessant cuts, then scenes will hard cut to a new shark attack or worried townsfolk. Jaws is creatively cut at a brisk pace that makes it feel like it's like a half hour long.\n\nProduction designer Joe Alves made cinema's greatest practical puppet effect with the mechanical shark Bruce to be the movie shark Jaws. The small town sets look very natural. Set decorator John M. Dwyer adorns the fishing vessels that have realistic equipment everywhere for hunting down sharks at sea. Make-up artists Del Armstrong and Jim Gillespie's make-up gives Robert Shaw gritty tattoos and a mustache, while Roy Scheider is clean cut like his character and Richard Dreyfuss is just a bit scruffy.\n\nThe acting is so believable and likable with Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss leading a thankless fishing voyage to hunt down Jaws. You get to know each of their characters, motives, and personalities. Jaws contains as charismatic a cast as you will ever see.\n\nGive Jaws a watch during a bright Summer day, then see if you will ever want to visit a beach again.",

            "content": "The debut blockbuster, Jaws, invaded U.S cinemas forty years ago today. The PG rated, 124 minute fear factor feature adaptation novel immediately caught the film-going audiences in 75. \nUniversal's Jaws swallowed instant success at the box-office, with $260,000,000 unadjusted domestic gross and a staggering $1,173,202,000 adjusted domestic gross. \nPossibly the most well constructed horror story in cinematic history, having the actual Great White appear just over half way into the motion picture. Its dooming presence is established in the opening sequence as it takes the life of Susan Backlinie.\nAll three characters are perfectly set-up and have well balanced screentime. Captain Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is Amity's police chief, and he is the one who reacts in the same way audience do, petfrified of the waters and concerned for the people of Amity Island. We genuinely feel sympathy for him when he is publicly shamed by Mrs. Kintner from the loss of her child, blaming Brody for his death. This brings us to the character Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity Island and pressures Brody to keep the beaches open for the 4th July, ending in disaster as Micheal Brody ends up hospital from the shock of seeing a man eaten by the shark. Then there is Quint (Robert Shaw), the intimidating but comedic with his witty lines such as, \"Half assed astronaut\" to Hooper and \"I saw one eat a rocking chair once.\" The man ex-navy marine has a good heart and has a hatred for sharks. My favourite character is next, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the witty scientist is the perfect example of a well rounded person. As he is the shark expert and bring fear into the audience as we see him terrified of the aftermath of Susan Backlinie. The chemistry of all three characters really come together when they are on the Orca and are hunting the killing machine. Especially the chemistry between Hooper and Quint butting heads of old vs new theme. But, then bonding when sharing scars from past shark attacks and all three men singing together. \nThe direction Spielberg chooses to go is without question perfect with the pacing not being too slow or too fast. The gradual build of tension throughout the motion picture pays off with the final battle with Brody and the man eating shark. \nOf course the score has to be mentioned with the great John Williams orchestrating it. Probably the most known theme in cinema, the film wouldn't be the same without the intensifying and sinister tone. It supports the film perfectly whenever the shark was on and off the camera. \nOverall Jaws is in my top five of Spielberg's filmography. The classic blockbuster will always be remembered as a monument in the horror genre.",

In their quest for the shark, the fellas take a little break when they happen upon a peaceful looking island, which happens to be home of Cerulian, a beautiful mermaid. The fellas set up a campfire, get drunk, tell more scar stories, and fall asleep. In the middle of the night, Quint wakes up abruptly to discover Cerulian perched on a rock under the bright moonlight. They get wet and wild but agree that this was nothing more than ships passing in the night. The next morning the trio heads back to conquer that daggone shark. Quint cant get Cerulian off of his mind. He writes her love letters and sends them in bottles. The rest of Quint's fate is carried out as is, in the original picture, but we have more explanation as to HOW HE WAS THE ONE WHO GOT EATEN BY THE SHARK AND NOT THAT LAME LAME HOOPER as he was distracted BY LOVE.

I watched this movie and all its sequels, and the sequels disappointed me so much more than I could have expected. They all missed the point. Jaws 2 copied the original story but added high school drama--childish drama is not the appeal of Jaws. Every other sequel missed this point as well. \nWhen I watched Jaws for the first time, it reminded me of one of my favorite books: The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. The appeal of Jaws is not the shark; we only even see the shark two or three times in the entire movie. The point of the movie is Martin's determination to protect his island and the psychological and physical struggles he will endure to do that; this is, in my opinion, very comparable to Santiago's struggle with the marlin. These two narratives are respectable and inspiring. And that, I think, is what makes Jaws an amazing movie (and it's sequels not so much).",

The story follows the town's chief as he investigates the source of the issue. Through watching the film, I found myself thoroughly enjoying it quite a bit more than I anticipated. Jaws didn't fail to let me down in terms of suspense and surprise, and that was thanks to the editing.  I feel that this was especially achieved in the pacing of the editing. Editor Verna Fields does a great job at drawing out each shot to build tension and to create and further the suspense. This is evidenced in a particular scene that takes place at the beach. The chief of police has just discovered that a great white shark has caused the initial death on the beach. In his attempt to shut down the beach, the town's mayor, who insists on keeping the beach open regardless, intercepts him. In the scene, the chief is on edge as he keeps watch of the beach's attendees. The scene cuts between different drawn out shots of those attendees as we wait in impatience for the potential impending threat. I found myself constantly on edge as I watched through these moments. The payoff of the scene being executed the way that it was were those great moments of surprise when the shark would finally surface and take on its next prey. I watched the film with some friends of mine, and we would literally jump out of our seats every time this would happen. One thing that I particularly enjoyed was that in the scenes that the shark made an appearance in, even though you knew the shark was coming, you were still surprised when it materialized.",

Robert Shaw gives an amazing performance, which I've later discovered is about 50% improvisation, as were a lot of Scheider's and Dreyfuss's. \n\nAs I understand it, this movie took literally forever to make and was extremely difficult to make given that it was shot out on the ocean.

He is paired up with shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss).  Upon discovering that they're dealing with a rather large great white shark, they have a hard time convincing the clueless mayor (Murray Hamilton) that they need to take serious measures to stop the predator.  It's not until another shark attack on a beach crowded with tourists that they hire local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to kill the shark.  Soon the three men board Quint's boat to take down the shark and it's tense action from then on.\nBased on the book by Peter Benchley, there are a lot of changes made for the film but you may not care because it's so well paced and put together.  Due to reported production issues, we don't see the shark a whole lot but Spielberg made it work through John Williams' famous score.  For me it made sense because the shark does look fake.  The performances are wonderful, the script is well written and the characters are developed and interesting.  Even better, the action in the third and forth acts is exciting and tense.

            "content": "Steven Spielberg's classic film about a giant shark terrorizing a small New England resort community is masterful entertainment and also (along with \"Star Wars\") ushered in the age of the blockbuster film, essentially ending major studio support of smaller edgier films of the 1960s and 70s. I recently listened to an interview with Roger Corman, the prolific low budget exploration filmmaker, who noted that after he saw \"Jaws\" he said to himself that he's in trouble because the majors figured out what he'd know for years, in terms of what audiences wanted to see, and did it much better. An argument could pretty easily be made that this is the greatest nature-gone-wild movie ever made. \"Jaws\" truly is a great film, but when most of it's competition was the the likes of \"Frogs\" (about a deadly hoards of frogs)  or \"Them\" (about giant radioactive ants) or \"Night of the Lepus\" (about giant killer rabbits), it shouldn't be much of a surprise \"Jaws\" wins out (okay, Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" is a pretty excellent nature-gone-wild film, but \"Jaws\" is still better). But back to \"Jaws,\" this is the film that put Spielberg on the map. Up to this point he'd mostly done television and had one film under his belt, the fine \"Sugarland Express,\" but \"Jaws\" is a popcorn movie of the first order. Roy Scheider is the Chief of Police for the sleepy beach community of Amity Island when he's confronted with a likely shark attack at the outset of tourist season. Murray Hamilton is great in a supporting role as the mayor who won't let Chief Brody shut down the beaches, that is until a horrific attack in front of legions of beachgoers. At that point Brody is authorized to enlist the help of young shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and crusty shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). Brody, Hooper, and Quint are a wonderful trio of contrasts aboard Quint's ship as they hunt the giant great white shark. One early exchange between Hooper and Quint quickly sums up their relationship:\n\nQuint: You have city hands, Mr. Hooper. You been countin' money all your life. \nHooper: All right, all right. Hey, I don't need this... I don't need this working-class-hero crap.\n\nAnd you have Brody, who lives on an island but doesn't ever go in the water, playing the level headed one of the trio who wants to be anywhere but on a boat. The character dynamics between the three are terrific fun to watch and lead to many memorable scenes and quips (\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" or \"Cage goes in the water, you go in the water. Shark's in the water.\" or \"Slow ahead. I can go slow ahead. Come on down here and chum some of this sh-t.\" or \"I'm not going to waste my time arguing with a man who's lining up to be a hot lunch.\" and then there's the USS Indianapolis speech. Quint's tale (and character motivation) is a perfect marriage of acting, writing, and direction and is likely my favorite scene of the film. Robert Shaw is absolutely riveting as he tells his tale of his WWII naval vessel going down after being hit by Japanese submarine torpedoes and the men having to survive for days in the water as sharks preyed upon them.  \"I'll never put on a life jacket again.\" There's been much discussion as to who wrote this scene, but according to Spielberg it was first written by playwright Howard Sackler, who wrote about three quarters of a page, and was then expanded by the great John Milius to about ten pages of dialogue, and lastly Shaw himself pared down Milius' work to what appears in the film. This has to be one of the all-time greatest moments committed to film. But the suspense Spielberg builds towards the end as the ship is slowing sinking while the three men struggle to figure out how to kill the shark and/or how to survive. The way the camera bobs up and down with the waves and how the camera gets lower and lower into the water as the boat slowly sinks is extremely effective in immersing the audience in the situation, especially if you've seen this film in a darkened theater on the big screen, where you nearly feel Brody's sea sickness, not to mention his terror as the shark gets closer and closer. But as fun this film is as a rollercoaster thrill ride, you also can't forget the quieter moments, such as the dinner table scene where Brody and his son silently mimic each other, which audiences would later realize is a moment of pure Spielberg. Or the smaller comic moments early in the film with Broday taking reports of kids from the karate class \"karate chopping\" the fences, perfectly establishing Chief Brody's usual police activities. Even these small moments all serve a purpose and there is not a wasted moment. Additional, no one could review this film without acknowledging the contribution of John Williams' iconic score. After watching the film I listen to Williams' score and found his heavy use of strings and even some of the themes very similar to Bernard Herrmann's score for \"Psycho.\" Overall, this film is an American film classic and is a must see for all audiences.",

How many variations of \"We're going to need a bigger boat.\" have you seen or heard in your everyday life? It is easy to see why Jaws became the first big summer blockbuster film. The visual effects still hold up even with today's standards. If you pause the film, you may be able to see how fake the mechanical shark actually looks, but combined with Spielberg's masterful camera work, he has been able to fool audiences for decades. However, it isn't the shark that makes the film so great, but the lack thereof. The shark isn't actually shown until halfway through the movie, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. An invisible enemy combined with the iconic soundtrack by John Williams creates an aura of suspense that is palpable.\nThe scene that really makes this movie memorable is the speech delivered by Quint to Hooper and Chief Brody out on the Orca after comparing scars and sharing drinks. He describes the weeks he spent floating in the sea after the Indianapolis sank, watching his crewmates get eaten by swarming sharks. Throughout the movie Quint is your stereotypical sea captain, singing sea shanties and drinking almost nothing but booze. Robert Shaw's stony faced, slightly slurred delivery is remarkable, horrifying the audience just as much as it horrified Hooper and Brody. This speech reveals to us why Quint is the way he is while making his death that much more ironic. The thing that has haunted him for most of his life is what ultimately ends up killing him.",

            "content": "The tension created in Jaws is unlike others. Even without showing the shark for almost half the movie, Spielberg is still able to successfully instill fear in the audience. The iconic \"dun uh -dun uh -dun-dun-dun-dun\" (which you probably just hummed to yourself while reading), lets viewers know exactly what is about to happen. We do not need to see a civilian getting ripped to shreds to be scared. The music itself is enough to send a chill throughout viewer's' bodies. One of the scariest parts is how ordinary all of the victims are. This allows the viewer's to connect and sympathize more with the characters, and makes it feel more realistic. The movie is relatable to teens, for it is so normal for younger people to hang out on the beach at night. As a teenage viewer, I have now learned that I never want to go swimming at night. It is also relatable for adults, pulling on the heartstrings when little Alex is attacked, almost forcing parents to imagine themselves in the same position. Regardless of age, this movie will make everyone feel uneasy at some point. \n\tI believe this is one of those movies where you pick up on something new every time you watch. The first time, I never would have guessed that the tank would result in the shark's demise. The second time, I wondered how I had totally missed that. As I had learned in film appreciation, every part of a story is important. There are numerous shots that focus on the tank, just filming it laying there for a few seconds, which seems very out of place. In reality, Spielberg was completely foreshadowing the importance the tank would play in the killing of the great white. This movie contains so many little details that can easily be overlooked, but when noticed, just adds more to the creative genius that is Jaws.",

            "content": "Jaws is considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made and it is easy to see why.  When it came out to be a horror movie in 1975 it is surprising to think that after watching it, there was more to this film than you could have expected from the title and poster of the movie.  There are many examples to why this was as great as it came out to be one being that it is considered to be the first ever \"summer blockbuster\" making way for other films to come and rack up the big bucks during the summer seasons.  Second is it's impacted on pop culture, as you can see countless references to the movie in your favorite TV shows, radio stations, and other movies as well.  But probably the most impactful is the fact it scared people into thinking there is a shark in the water,  after seeing this film you can admit you feel a little skeptical about taking one step into the ocean.  The movie has remained a spectacle today and holds up as well and here is why.\nWhen the script was first bought by Universal Studios in 1973, the producers didn't know what to make of it.  It was a script that was ready to go into production but they couldn't find the right director or cast for the picture.  Once the producers landed on a young director, Steven Spielberg, they were 100% ready for production and had the leading cast of Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss ready to go.  The film was finished and production was considered hell.  Many script changes, malfunctions with the mechanical sharks, and actors having fights with each other.  Many of the film crew were surprised by how the film came out including Steven Spielberg.  Spielberg said, \"I thought this was the beginning of the end of my career, this production continues to haunt me today.\"  But once Jaws hit theater in 1975 people were waiting in lines out of the theatre to go in see it, it became a worldwide phenomenon making $470,653,000 worldwide.  Viewers were hooked by this film and it easy to see why.\n\tThe reason why Jaws is so great is the well development of layered characters that are not just plain 1 dimensional characters, the filming which made it so frightening as putting the point of view toward the shark and letting the human imagination determine what is doing the damage to the victim, and lastly the pace of the movie, this film did such a great job telling this story and it has the work of Spielberg's taste for adventure all over it.  This film keeps viewers hooked from beginning to the end.\n\tWhen this film ended I wondered whether or not is ok to swim in the ocean.  But everytime I step foot in that water and have doubts about what is under the surface of the water, I have this film to thank.  Not only that, for this is considered as my favorite movie I have ever seen.",

The pure terror that is constantly reoccuring through a mechanical shark keeps the audience at the edge of their seats while frustration builds off the shark's incredible power. Spielberg did a brilliant job of concealing the shark until nearly the middle of the film. This creates incredible suspense as the audience waits for the next attack, scaring them away from the ocean. With limited technology, the mechanical shark look fairly realistic but I did not expect it to look so real in the water and later on the boat. This realism adds to the terrifying sequences of attacks as it looks like a real shark that could come back and attack you.\n\tApart from the shark attacking is the incredible development of the characters themselves. As the film progresses so do the characters, we watch as Chief Brody loses his fear of the water and eventually bests the evil that is the shark. Also, we see a growing relationship between Hooper and Quint as they compare scars which leads to the Quint's monologue telling the story of the USS indianapolis. This story had been analyzed, improvised, and delivered brilliantly through Robert Shaw which commenced the damage to The Orca. The overall journey of the three crew members took the audience to a place they will never forget.",

The illusive suspense of the killer shark haunting Amity Island paired with the terrifying genius of John Williams's soundtrack transports viewers into a summer vacation gone wrong. A timely thriller to kick off the swim, beach and vacation season, Spielberg struck a gold mine. With this film, theaters and film makers discovered a new market giving birth to the iconic summer blockbuster. American film has this beginning to thank for its long list of beloved summer hits including Back to the Future, The Dark Knight, Grease, Gremlins, Top Gun, Inception, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ghostbusters and Toy Story 3.\n     Among having Jaws to thank for an abundant list of classic favorites, the film in it of itself hits all the marks. Spielberg's character development comes to a climax in the famous boat scene. The crux of Hooper, Brody and Gardner's understanding of each other is also a revelation to the audience at the same time. While Gardner is giving insight to his character through his anecdote about his encounters with sharks, the speech also serves as a building tension to finally seeing the shark that is the film's driving storyline.

The music is one of the most memorable and biggest part. The bass slowly going faster and faster when the shark gets closer and closer to its target. It really makes you scared of the unseeable. You don't see the shark until halfway through the movie, but you're still scared right from the start. You're on the edge of your seat waiting for the shark to pop out of the water and claim its next victim, but sometimes they were just false alarms and the shark comes out when you least expect it. The shark itself wasn't that great of a prop, but was used so well by Spielberg in the sense that he only used in quick camera cuts that were also up-close to the shark. One thing that I don't like that the movie did in my opinion is the way sharks are viewed by people now after they watch this movie. This movie made sharks out to be evil monsters that kill everything they see. People started to deliberately go out and kill sharks, people that never even go into the water. People have a slim to none chance of being involved in a shark attack. Overall, I really enjoy this movie and believe everyone should watch this classic movie.",

From the year it was made I'm surprised how all the effects and acting turned out. The beginning of the movie really amazes me because even though you know the movie is about sharks, something about not seeing the actual shark adds an eerie vibe to the movie. You don't really know what's pulling the kids down into the water or how big whatever \"it\" is. I think Spielberg did a great job at directing it that way. Until when you really start to see the shark for the first time and realize it is a monster and start to fear what everyone in the movie was fearing. \n\tThe middle through the end of the movie is my favorite part personally. The three actors they hired for this movie to play Martin Brody, Matt Hooper and Quint was great casting. Each of their roles was not only great acting, but made the movie more interesting to watch. How three very different men come together to defeat this monster of a shark and end up doing it amazes me. What I did not expect was Quint to be the one who died. I figured it would be Hooper since he seemed to be the more weaker one out of the three. The showing of his death was pretty gruesome but also awesome. That's when you really get a close up of what the shark looks like and honestly the special effects were just as good. Again, mentioning from what year this movie was made, I would assume the shark would look like a clay animation. But I was really surprised on how real it looked in the movie. I really was happy with watching this movie, I thought it was a good story plus good effects and shots. I would give this movie 5 stars.",

            "content": "Similar to what Arachnophobia and Psycho do to showering, Jaws causes you to want to stay on the nice dry beach, far far away from the water's edge this summer. Opened in 1975, Jaws has continued to invoke a psychological fear from the moment Spielberg decided to start his opening scenes off with a girl being attacked by a shark and escalated to a full scale shark attack on the weekend of 4th of July, all leading up to the final man-to-shark battle at the conclusion of the film. \n\n\tThis film is split into two sections- the \"before\" the shark is seen, and the \"after\". The \"before\" part is prior to when Spielberg allows us the pleasure of seeing the much alluded shark. He builds up the idea of 'evil' and 'enemy' with his other characters to go along with the suspense that his film is building up, so we don't even really notice that the shark is missing in a sense. He was able to build this up in his music choices. This \"evil\" is seen in the mayor (Murry Hamilton) along with the town council, when they refuse to close down the beach even after the first death, because they don't want to lose the town money. Without his stamp of approval, further deaths occurred and he is eventually forced to admit that something must be done about the shark problem. \n\nThe shark itself we only see in fleeting and distant sightings, none of which satisfy our desire to see the beast. In the final 20 minutes of the film, do we actually get a full length shot of the creature- and then we see the reason behind Spielberg's non inclusion of the animal- it looks fake. But in retrospect, we did not even need to see it in the earlier moments of the film, since Spielberg's cuts and inclusion of suspenseful music allowed us to have a growing sense of fear and doom anyway.\n\t\n\tThe end was, in my opinion, a plot twist. There was the defeat of the deadly beast- but there was also the death of a ruthless character we had grown to love- a tragic death at that. There have been many movies that have attempted to replicate this film, and many more that have created spoofs, but nothing will ever be able to compete with Spielberg's work.",

            "content": "A pioneer for modern suspense techniques, Steven Spielberg's film Jaws, remains the greatest and uncontested summer beach blockbuster of all time.  Even those who have not had the pleasure of watching it know of the famous theme song as the shark slices through the water to reach the next victim. Even more outstanding, the suspense that Jaws created for horror movies to come was by chance. The way the events unfold throughout the movie directly correlate to a broken down mechanical shark and it is not until halfway through the plot that the viewer finally meets Jaws once and for all. For this reason, Spielberg has a unique chance, one that he masterfully uses, of adding an element of mystery to the plot. Often time's before the shark attacks, the viewer gets a high angled shot onto the legs of possible victims before he makes his final move and effectively gives the killer a point of view. One of the most impactful and gruesome uses of this shot is when little Alex Kintner and his yellow float are chose as the next victim and all the viewer sees is a fountain of blood. For some, Jaws hit so close to home that they were repelled by the thought of swimming in the ocean, much less to dip a toe in to feel the water's temperature.\nOne of the most iconic lines in Jaws is when Matt Hooper says, \"What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks, and that's all.\" This line perfectly encapsulates the essence of the shark and it nonexistent \"humanity\" and instead refers to it as a machine without thought or feeling. However, this quote also serves to heighten the stories of the people on land, specifically Chief Brody This film may be mistaken for the typical horror bloodbath, yet it works hard to be anything but. This is a story of tragedy, of family, and of humanity.  To make sure that the audience understood this, Speilberg added the scene when Brody and his son are sitting at the dinner table. Chief Brody did what was simply evolutionary expected of him when he made \"little sharks\" yet there is a difference between him and Jaws. When his son starts copying him it shows a clear human and emotional connection that any parent viewing it could relate to. \"Give your old man a kiss,\" Chief Brody says with affection. This is a film about people just as much as it is about a murderous shark. This film is effective in conveying the love and loss between characters and developing their lives. It expertly manipulates the viewer to laugh one second and to feel hopeless the next. Jaws will always be the classic beach movie that is watched the week prior to Memorial Day Weekend to entice the nostalgia and appropriate fear as people head off to swim in the lovely blue sea.",

The music, camerawork, dialogue, characters, and story all combine to make the movie a classic.  With all of these elements Spielberg crafts a film that thrills and entertains the audience throughout the whole experience.  The music of the film is a excellent piece, combining simplicity with longer notes.  This combination creates a suspenseful and intense atmosphere which fits the premise of the movie perfectly.  Using the camera to mimic the point of view of a shark also draws forth the feeling of suspense.  The anticipation of not knowing is actually Jaws number one thrilling aspect.  Humanity has feared the unknown for as long as we have existed and Spielberg preys upon it like a shark preys upon innocent children.\n\n\tThe interesting characters and story capture the audience keeping them glued to their seats through the entire experience.  The characters had personality and felt real, connecting to the viewer on a personal basis.  When designing or casting these characters you have to keep in mind how a person or specific character would react in a certain situation.  Spielberg achieved this feat with flying colors as everything from the dialogue to the actions that they take it all feels real.  That is another thing that Jaws did well is basing the story in reality.  None of the story felt farfetch, which is one of the reasons that this movie achieves its goal in scaring people.  The idea that this could happen to you is a frightening message, and one that Jaws delivered effectively.  Spielberg made a classic that can stand the test of time, and will continue to strike fear into audiences for years to come.",

            "content": "The film Jaws is like no other and has the perfect story line.  Instead of making the shark the villain initially, the mayor is portrayed as the bad guy with greed pushing him to do the wrong thing.  This is a concept that most people are familiar with.  The rich man who is only concerned with the money involved rather than the deeper meaning and safety of others.  Even though a shark attack is super uncommon nowadays, people still tend to have a fear of them.  I remember being younger and being scared to go swimming in pools in case a shark was for some reason lurking in there.  This fear is instilled in most people which makes this film even more scary.\n\tConsidering the age of this film and the special effects being used, it does a pretty remarkable job at making this shark absolutely terrifying and realistic.  The acting certainly accentuates the realness of the attacks.  In society, humans seem to view themselves at the top of the food chain and believe that no animal can stop them.  This shark contradicts that belief and seems to be in charge for the majority of the film.  Despite efforts of shooting it, dragging it, and stabbing it, the shark continues on frightening the people of this island.  Even though in the end the shark is killed, it was an intense battle and multiple lives were lost in the process.  Overall, I am a huge fan of the film Jaws and would recommend it to many.",

            "content": "Jaws is one of the most terrifying monster movies ever made, yet it has less than 10 minutes of the monster on screen. The shark is not the monster, it is the ingenious music and the tense atmosphere that cause us to dread the creature.  However, the shark itself is not even a looming threat until the second half of the film, as the first half and even a majority of the second half are dedicated to the characters. That is why this film holds up even 42 years later, because Spielberg knew to create memorable, likable, interesting characters that hold our attention when the shark is not devouring helpless people. He knew to use the shark sparingly, he knew to turn the shark into an entity with John williams brilliant score, he knew to make every kill different  and every scare unique. Spielberg knew that gore and a cool monster wouldn't make a great film, he used the subtlety of a film like Haunted House with the tone/feel of a modern day summer film to create a truly unique and wonderful movie. \nThe shark is not scary, it's not a very creative design nor does the animatronic look very realistic, but Jaws is terrifying. We almost always see the shark with a point of view shot, giving us a sense of helplessness as we see move through a sea of legs and close in on it's prey. We know what will happen, yet we can only dread the inevitable as the camera cruelly and slowly moves to its target. The music builds up slowly, gradually, going from creating ominous dread to heart-pounding terror right before the kill. Another thing that makes the shark terrifying when it is on screen is the fact that every scare is done in a different way. Unlike a Friday the 13th film or Elm street sequel, where every kill is just an over the top gore fest, every time someone dies it is different. For example, when the teenage girl gets attacked to the shark, we our are cruelly subjected to see almost every minute of her death, hearing every scream and cry, paralyzing us with fear. Yet the Kittner boy's death is completely different, we merely see the mass of blood in the water, and the bitten life raft, making this death more shocking than letting the tragedy come in when The mother calls out for her son in vain. The different methods Spielberg employes to make the shark scary prevents the creature from becoming predictable, keeping the audience on it's toes. However, we are never bored when the shark is off screen, as the main characters are some of the best in blockbuster history. \nThe writers of this film knew that having a scary monster is not enough to engage an audience or make a film last, so it seems they dedicated more time in making these characters interesting, memorable, likable, and relatable. They succeeded, as years latter we still quote Quint, Hooper, and Martin Brody and even remember the some of the side characters like Ellen and the Mayor. I think what separates these characters from the Jurassic Park-esque stock characters (which can be entertaining in their own right) is that cast is not overly large. We only have 3 main characters in Jaws and primarily follow one, as opposed to something like Lost World, Which starts with out with 5 main characters. Because of the relatively small cast, our main trio get much more focus and are able to be fleshed out in a more natural way. There are no long, Shyamalan style expostion monologues explaining the characters to us, we simply watch the characters. We are introduced to Brody by seeing his family life and average routine, We see Hooper mocking the shark hunters and how he does his job, and we gradually see Quint go from unhinged sailor to insane hunter. The film lets us grow attached to these characters, allows the audience to form a connection with them, become invested in them. Brody, Hooper, and Quint personality feel organic and fresh, allowing from some fun and interesting interactions. My favorite is the relationship between Quint and Hooper, as their polar opposite personalities bounce off each other in some brilliant scenes. Quint's rough, old fashioned, and violent personality clashes with both Hooper's jumpy, sarcastic persona and reserved and scientific approach. Yet despite their passionate arguments, Hooper seems to have a desire to prove himself to Quint or best him. This perfectly exemplified when Quint crushes and empty can,  and Hooper crushes a plastic cup in response. You could show someone this scene and they would instantly get an idea of what these characters are like and how they work off each other. Brody, Hooper, and Quint are the reason why Jaws is a great film, they are the reason we watch this film over and over again. When they are not on screen, the hybrid of slow cinematography and intense music known the characters refer to as a shark keep on the edge of our seats. This is why Jaws is the greatest horror film ever made, one of the greatest blockbusters ever made, and a cinematic masterpiece.",

The ever-prevalent despair when some poor unfortunate and naive actor wanders into the water and you know what's coming, but there is nothing you can do about it. That is true horror-movie fear, and Jaws has plenty of that. Even viewing the long-shots of the boat just peacefully floating in the water promotes some level of anxiety in even the toughest movie viewer.\n\nMuch of the fear of the movie comes from the fact that you rarely ever actually wind up seeing the shark that is spoken of often throughout the film. It's right in front of your face practically the whole movie, but it is only seen at the very end of the film, This is a classic film tactic that is still used in horror movies, today. It mimics reality as well, as you will rarely see a shark before it takes a chomp out of you.",

            "content": "There's only one movie that people credit with making them too scared to swim in the ocean or even the pool in their backyard. Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" took the film industry by storm when it was released in 1975. Its simple yet terrifying theme song, which remains iconic to this day, was ranked 6th on the American Film Institute's 100 Years of Film Scores. Spielberg brilliantly combines this music with underwater traveling shots to create tension as the audience sees the world from the shark's point of view. It's impossible to know when the shark is going to strike, thus striking fear into the audience. Despite major production issues that almost left \"Jaws\" half eaten and washed up on the shore, \"Jaws\" became the highest grossing film of its time.\n\n Being loosely based off of a book written by Peter Benchley, Spielberg created a horrifyingly realistic representation of Benchley's made up world in which a small town has a powerful, man-eating shark on its hands. Some may say the effort put into creating a giant, mechanical shark was not worth the final outcome because it didn't give the most convincing performance. However, by not allowing audiences to see the shark until the second half of the film, Spielberg retains some of its flare. The effects used to make it look as though the shark is pulling three barrels underwater or slowly swimming underneath the boat give off the appearance that they are dealing with not only a strong, but a smart beast. Supplemented with real shark footage as well, \"Jaws\" holds more than enough of a fear factor to keep anyone's feet dry, at least until they watch its sequels.",

            "content": "The film Jaws created by effects genius Steven Spielberg, and was based off of the book written by Peter Benchley, and took the film world by storm in 1975. The movie was one of the firsts of its kind because it basically became the first summer blockbuster setting a precedent on what one looked like. In my opinion Jaws is a nearly flawless film that takes the viewer on an interesting journey starting with a couple of attacks on people, to a full fledged manhunt to take down the shark. There are many things that make this film so great; the way that Spielberg does not show the shark for the first half of the film, the amazing portrayals of the three main characters that go on the shark hunt, and finally the story of the film is perfect and flows beautiful. \nThere is so much suspense and tension built up over the course of the first half of the film with the viewer in the point of the shark. By doing this it creates the actual horror of the shark attacking people without actually showing the full shark, and when they show the shark in pursuit of its victims all that is seen is his dorsal fin. This technique further adds to the suspense of an attack, and then they finally build all of this up to the full reveal of the shark whilst the men are hunting it. Next the portrayal of the three main characters is perfect, and they each add a key element to the film that is essentially irreplaceable. The first character we meet is Roy Scheider's \"Matt Brody\" the local police chief who works on the island and is afraid of water. That little detail is completely ironic because in a shark hunt he is going to need to be on a boat in the water, and that just adds further to his character development. The next character that is introduced is actually Robert Shaw's \"Quint\", but we don't completely get his story until the actual shark hunt because he is only in the one scene to announce he'll kill the shark. Therefore the next character made known is Richard Dreyfuss \"Matt Hooper\" who is a rich-kid marine biologist who is there to study the shark and help bring it down. He provides a perfect foil to \"Quint\" as they butt heads on the boat(and the set), making their character dynamics an interesting one to follow. After \"Hooper\" is introduced the audience gets to meet the real \"Quint\" as they begin their journey to kill the shark. This is when we see \"Quint\" in his element being the hard nosed, ex-military man who has the \"his way or the highway mentality\", and is arguably the best character in this film. Seeing the three characters together on the boat and the way they interact with one another is phenomenal they add depth to the film.",

            "content": "Jaws is a fantastic film that uses technology in a way unknown to its time. This technology is truly shown through the shark. The shark, from the point of view of the audience, looks as if it is actually a real shark. In reality, the shark is made from machinery and technology and in its full form does not look too realistic. Spielberg is able to deal with this by using specific camera angles that make the shark have the effect that it does. Furthermore, when Spielberg portrays the shark, he often does it in a way that does not even show the shark. This is done through a point of view shot through the eyes of what is thought to be the shark. The audience, in fact, knows that it is the shark through the classic music played as the shark approaches a person.\nAlso, aside from the shark, Spielberg does a great job on his film through the tension and shift in mood. This movie quickly moves through highs and lows. The film often quickly switches from a peaceful mood to a high tension dark mood. This is done through the sound and effects. When the mood is peaceful, all the audience can hear is laughter, splashing, and kids playing. This is while you see the bright sun and bright colors around the beach. This mood quickly changes when the cut goes to the shark with the high tension music approaching a person. After each attack, the water turns red and there is no more screaming. There is only screaming and running of the people.",

Since Jaws has a huge fan base and is the most notorious shark film, I already had an idea of the plot. However, knowing what was going to happen before I saw the film and knowing it was created more than two decades before I was even born, Spielberg still created one of the most memorable works of cinematography. When I was a kid, I remember being out in the ocean and my older cousin imitating the music that corresponded to the shark. Even at a young age I knew what the music signified, a shark. \n\tAfter seeing Jaws for the first time last year, I really enjoyed the movie and was happy to have finally watched it. I have just watched it for a second time a week ago and the movie was just as good or even better than it was before. A huge scene that makes this movie for me is the Indianapolis Speech that Quint delivers. The whole time the crew of men are showing their battle wounds and sharing a good laugh, as a viewer I feel like I am on the boat with them and it's a typical night out at sea, void of problems. As Quint begins his speech, his speech captivates the audience and causes me to hold my breath. Quint is this strong, fearless, confident fisherman throughout the whole film. Once he reaches the speech we see a more vulnerable side of him, showing the similarities the three men actually have with their caution towards sharks and the ocean around them. His speech shows a huge turning point in the atmosphere and foreshadows a possible death the men can face as no one can reach them out at sea just like the Indianapolis.\n\tOverall, the movie is perfectly structured with each scene having a purpose that drives the plot and makes the film a huge success.",

            "content": "Duh duh, duh duh; we all know that famous soundtrack by John Williams that leaves us haunted by the depths of the ocean, the anticipation is the scare and that is utilized by Stephen Spielberg in his movie \"Jaws\". For almost half of the movie didn't need a shark. All it took was some well conducted music and a camera and we all know what's going to happen which is brilliant in film. For a movie in 1975, the effects were astounding, blood, the shark, the explosions were all fake but felt so real which made the movie more intriguing. Jaws is a sense thrilling blockbuster that will excite your ears eyes and mind.\n\nBut Spielberg and John williams were not the only players that brought this movie to stardom. The actors were well chosen and executed the movie almost perfectly. Most of the actors that were chosen for the parts were not even the first pick. Actually Jaws came to be from mostly second choices and improvisations. The introduction for quint was supposed to be in a movie theatre while he watches moby dick, but they couldn't get the rights, and that's how the famous scene of fingernails on the chalkboard and the famous quote \"Y'all know me. Know how I earn a livin'. I'll catch this bird for you, but it ain't gonna be easy. Bad fish. Not like going down the pond chasin' bluegills and tommycods. This shark, swallow you whole. Little shakin', little tenderizin', an' down you go. And we gotta do it quick, that'll bring back your tourists, put all your businesses on a payin' basis. But it's not gonna be pleasant.\" We will see this reference in the simpsons and many other shows. Also Quint's monologue in the ship about the SS Indianapolis was off script and it was touching and amazing and the reactions of Roy and Richard in the first take are the only natural reactions and had to be used. The most amazing aspect of Jaws is that most of the movie was made with 2nd choices and I could only imagine what it would be like if it was made with everything Spielberg wanted.",

            "content": "The 1975 American thriller Jaws directed by Steven Spielberg and based on Peters Benchley's 1974 novel is a movie to never forget watching. The movie leaves an impact, maybe even being able to leave fear or paranoia of going down the beach to some people. Spielberg does an amazing job of portraying suspense. He does this by playing that infamous music in the background or taking slow, peaceful shots of the scenery before a head floats out of a boat. The main characters and their desire to catch the shark make them hero like which is why they are characters to give props to.\nAn example of the peaceful shots in the movie to create suspense includes one of the very first shots of the girl running into the water and floating. The audience has an idea that something is going to happen but the scenery is calm and the shot of her floating is slow which makes everyone nervous for her. Foreshadowing plays a big part in this movie as well especially the part where Chief Brody doesn't want his son to take the boat in the ocean so he tells him to put it in the bay side. What Spielberg wants you to think that everything is going to be okay because the boat is in the calm bay. There are pauses in dialogue between the chief and his son which makes suspicion rise within the audience. Another shot that catches the audience by surprise is when Hooper dives down to track the shark but the audience is introduced to a scene that makes them jump out of their seat. Overall, between the scary music and peaceful shots in the movie the audience is definitely thrilled. \nRoy Scheider plays the town chief police, Brody, and is someone to connect to because he wants the best for everyone. He was originally scared of going out in the water and what makes him even more likeable is that he ends up going out for the sake of his town. There is no doubt in my mind that if Quint, \"Robert Shaw\", wasn't in this movie then it wouldn't of have been as good as it was. Shaw brought an edge to the movie because at first you almost hate him for being such an ass but he ends up bringing life to the movie because how funny he is. He doesn't mean to be funny but because he doesn't care what other people think it makes the audience envy him in a way. Shaw plays a fisherman who is obsessed with hunting the shark and his dedication is obvious. It's great how he wants to out show Richard Dreyfuss who plays Hooper, a ichthyologists. As soon as they meet each other Hooper feels disrespected, it's like watching brothers fight but Quint will always win. The characters have conflicts and may not understand each other but they are all certain how much they want this shark to be destroyed.",

            "content": "Jaws - The number one horror movie known to keep people away from the beach, and also a timeless classic. I tell ya, I have never been the type to be scared during, nor after films - I get startled easily by jumpscares, but for the most part, it's just easily brushed off. Not this film. It was intense throughout the whole ride, from start to finish, and it don't hurt that the effects at the time still hold up beautifully, thanks to Spielberg's amazing talent in film work and dedication. I will say that the story itself was predictable - but that's a given when you have a lot of later films copying off of this one to ride on its coattails. Like, you could tell that someone was going to die in that scene where the people are swimming in the water on Fourth of July, but at the same time, it seemed like it was intended to be that way to build up suspense, and that it did. It goes to show that predictability can sometimes make something pretty unpredictable. \n\tNot only that, but the characters in Jaws were both very memorable and relatable, something that is unheard of in a lot of horror movies. In most horror films, you got these either morally ambiguous or grade A jerks that end up being eaten, and then you have the protagonist who acts as the audience surrogate. Here, our main guy is Chief Martin Brody, and while he is the chief of police in Amity Island, you also see that he has a family that he wants to protect from the man eating shark lurking in the ocean. In one scene, you see the three main heroes hunting down Jaws, Quint, Brody, and Hooper, all of them talking together over a drink telling horror stories about their adventures by the ocean. Not only does it help with relating with the audience, but it makes the possible death of any of them all the more intense and that kind of storytelling is what makes Jaws so memorable. It's a story and characters first, effects and scares second - they don't have to rely on cheap gore or shock to make people invested and enjoy the film. People come back for the adventure of it all, and the impact that it has on them in how it combines its horror elements with its great writing and development is enough on its own to be a classic on any movie shelf.",

Straight away, we have to deal with the giant rubber shark that leaps onto the boat towards the climax of the movie. It didn't really work in the 1970s and it really doesn't work now but by the time it appears, it ceases to matter as the sheer terror has been well established. The movie is formed of two distinct acts. Firstly, we have the onshore story of how the small American community of Amity Island learn of the monstrous, great white shark that has come to visit their shallows at the start of the holiday season. While in the second act, we go aboard the fishing vessel Orca with her captain, the local police chief and a shark expert and follow their attempt to track and kill the beast. This second act is a real jewel of a character piece thanks to the fine acting talents of Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss. I love the scene where Shaw's Quint and Dreyfuss' Hooper compare scars in an attempt at one-upmanship and the line from Schneider's Chief Brody \"You're going to need a bigger boat!\" has entered film legend. There's also that terrific score by John Williams that does so much to terrify the viewer. The theme is now such a part of popular culture that there can be few of us that haven't had those menacing bars of music reverberating through our heads at some point while we paddle in the sea at Paignton.",

Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw lead the cast and deliver some pretty good performances.  But the real star of course is the shark, and Spielberg does an excellent job at giving it a real sense of terror.

            "content": "'Jaws' is a classic example of a masterpiece in cinematic movie making. I watched it on the remastered Blu-ray edition today for the first time since I last watched it probably 15 years ago either on VHS or DVD. It's a film I've so rarely seen that I'd almost forgot the main and finer details and indeed the plot developments which happen over the entire course of its 2 hour run time. I'd forgotten who the sharks victim's were and how the film ended. In fact, I almost completely forgotten the last third of the film until today.\n\nFor some films, time does not treat them well, and there are certain 'classics' ('Once Upon a Time in America'/'The Deer Hunter' to name two) which are not particularly good. I feared this would this would be the case with Jaws, especially as I could barely remember any of it, indicating that my viewing of it was a forgettable experience. Well, that assumption couldn't have been further from the truth. The direction and cinematography are (still) outstanding, the story is paced nicely provided a few jumps and plenty of tension and suspense along the way. The acting is solid from all the cast, and the main protagonists are all likeable and memorable in their own (often midly quirky) way. Clearly I wasn't paying attention when I watched 'Jaws' all those years ago! I was also surprised to learn just how good the effects and the formidable shark have stood the test of time.\n\nOf further note, the remastered Blu-ray is probably one of the best I've had the pleasure to experience. Spielberg and Co. were on the board for this remaster, and it clearly shows. The picture quality, and all that entails, is superb for a film of this age, but what utterly stunned me was just how well they remixed and remaster the audio. Due to the fact that this film was produced and released (1975) in the 70's, it's hardly surprising that the original track was produced in mono. The Blu-ray remix and remaster is now in 7.1, but this is probably the only remix of a film of this age that works this well, at least on my experience. Most of the remix is largely front heavy (with the exception of the superb musical score) but it provides excellent and natural spacing. But there are also occasional (when the scenes call for it) nicely placed discrete effects that really brings the viewer into the scene. The dialogue is also super clear but not tinny or abrasive like some dialogue recording of a similar era. Quite simply, like the film itself, this is a remaster that defies the test of time and sounds much more modern than it is. 5/5",

As someone who respects and loves the work of Steven Spielberg, I always avoided this one film of his, possibly one of his most important films, due to the simple fact that I don't enjoy horror films and thought this was apart of that genre. After actually viewing the film however, I must concede that I was completely wrong and robbing myself of the enjoyment of this masterful film for much longer than necessary. The film is less about the aspect of horror and sheer destruction and death that the shark can bring, and is much more about the characters and their fears of the unknown. Chief Brody, being scared of the ocean, boats, and anything sea related, Quint who saw his brothers and sisters in uniform while serving in the Navy being ripped apart by sharks, and by Hooper who wants to prove his knowledge of sharks and abilities on this journey, all these characters make for a compelling 2 hour film that masterfully gives you emotion and backstory to characters without drawn out flashbacks or over the top reactions. Most of the backstory if given simply through dialogue between characters which the viewer pieces together, I always appreciate that sort of story telling. The music is famously fantastic thanks to the amazing work of John Williams, the shark himself still holds up as special effects today thanks to the practicality of him, and the entire message of the film still stands the test of time. The message of fearing the unknown but tackling it anyways for the betterment of our lives.

Jaws is one of those films that will always be a classic gem to me as there's no other shark film that's up there with Jaws, not even the sequels. The acting is terrific and which I'm glad that it made movie careers from Richard Dreyfuss and the late Roy Scheider. I'm glad that it builds up to the shark rather then showing it right away as it builds the tension and mystery to whether it's actually a shark, and if it is, how big was it? The movie doesn't really show much of the shark as it shows more of the characters here, and they got enough characterization that I find them interesting throughout the entire movie. The effect on the shark looks so good to this day that it really was ahead of its time. The writing by the author Peter Benchley and The Jerk co-writer Carl Gottlieb is really well-written with some funny humor, and a scare that actually got me. The score by John William is really catchy, and the movie's theme song will always be good for years until the end of time. The last act is a lot of fun to watch, and it's tense. Jaws is a fantastic film to this day, and it's interesting that Steven Spielberg was well known as it started with this movie.",

If you come looking for that a guarantee you wont find it. But a thriller? Jaws easily ranks among the best.",

            "content": "Jaws is a bone chilling story that is emotional and terrifying. The suspenseful music sparks immediate fear without even seeing or hearing the horrific monster from below.   The story takes place in the beautiful, peaceful town of Amity, where the summer days at the beach are near close to heaven until it is suddenly taken over by the brutality of a blood thirsty great white shark. The movie Jaws is at the top of the suspense list in film making history, It's amazing and addicting storyline keeps you guessing, keeps you watching, and most importantly, keeps you thinking about the fear that lurks below long after the credits are over. Jaws was clearly created for the suspense-thriller genre and exceeds all expectations!\n            Jaws was the first of it's kind and for many people, the slow and continuously faster beat of the opening song makes people cringe every time they think about entering the water. The story of Jaws is enough to put you on the edge of your seat, but when added with stylistic and perfectly timed music, it makes you want to close your eyes but still peek through your fingertips. The soundtrack of the movie is brilliant, timeless and recognizable even today-years after the film's release. It is very stirring to the older generation but will certainly have an everlasting affect on the new and upcoming generations. One that when played, everyone knows its origin and meaning, even if they haven't seen the film. The first scene of the movie sets the tone with the bone chilling music and that keeps you watching unable to move throughout the entire 2-hour long thriller. The music is undoubtedly a huge part of this movie's success and staying power.\n            Jaws is a classic! One of the best of all time. Most people would say that when they think of the genre suspense, one movie always comes to mind, Jaws. This movie is a must see! It's a movie that touched millions throughout the 1970's and is continuing to do the same a half a century later. As I sat and watched this classic film, I thought to myself that in today's movie industry everything is action packed with much detail and high tec cameras and graphics. This is what moves us today but watching Jaws made me realize how a suspense movie should be made. Jaws is a movie that was made without todays technology but it far outmatches anything that has been made of late. Jaws is one for the ages and will always be one of the greatest suspense-thrillers ever made. Jaws will make you rethink swimming in the shallowly blues of our beloved but unpredictable oceans.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has truly made history in cinema! He has indeed, invented one of the award- winning movies of a lifetime! I am here to tell you that this movie is nothing less than suspenseful. When there are signs of a bloodthirsty beast deep below the ocean blue, you have no other choice but to wonder what will happen to the next human that plunges into the water. This is nothing short of dramatic irony, intensity and of course the detail that is highlighted to make this movie possible. There is complete irony within this film. As I noticed the \"Amity Island Welcomes You!\" sign, I couldn't steer my eyes past the picture portrayed on the billboard shown in the movie. The picture emulates the women smiling, sitting on her surfboard, out in open water. When speaking about a movie dealing with a shark and then having the lady on the billboard sitting in open water, will obviously have a problematic issue. This sign was portraying nothing but happiness that \"should\" be experienced at the beach. Throughout the movie, we see plenty of \"fishy\" things happening that lead us to wonder, what will happen next? The dramatic irony of all of this is that fact that we as the viewers KNOW what is out to get humanity in this situation. Even before seeing the movie, we can assume what is happening to an extent. The camera view being used has helped shape this movie to what it is today. You wouldn't expect angles to play such a detrimental part of a movie, but for this Spielberg movie, it does. Another main aspect that carried this movie through the suspense genre was the music they had composed. From the instruments with a lower- flat noted sound to the tempo of each beat speeding up, this leaves you with the anxious feeling that I mentioned earlier. Their timing not only with their tempo, but when to place it within the movie was absolutely fantastic! To only place notes that ring \"here I come\" when the shark is about to attack couldn't have been more perfect for the set up.  Without the affects of the music, the dramatic irony of it all and especially the shark being hidden away for the majority of the movie, we wouldn't have the movie Steven Spielberg calls \"Jaws\". Let us not surpass the movie that is a motion picture legacy.",

I remember my father telling me about when Jaws was first released in theatres in 1975 and how it scared people out of the ocean.

The Amity police chief Brody is the main human character. (Roy Scheider).\nWhen it becomes apparent that Amity has a problem! Brody with the help of a marine expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) take to the waters to hunt the beast down aboard a fishing vessel.\nBrodys immortal line 'Where gonna need a bigger boat!' becomes one of cinemas greatest lines of dialogue.\nThe music score by John Williams is incredibly scary and recognisable becoming again totally associated with the film.\nThe shark effects are totally man made. Cheap but effective and long before CGI ruined films!\nThe death of Quint is one of the most gory images I have ever watched and I've watched some sick films.\nSpielberg would reach global fame for this film and his great work would go on for years.\nRobert Shaw as Quint looks totally different to the Red Grant character he played 12 years previous in From Russia With Love.\nA cinematic masterpiece.",

Everything about the film is amazing, and its amazing that this film was even made because of what was going on, on set during production.\n        One of the reasons I love this film is the characters, Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss, to name a few, are excellent characters. Chief Brody, played by Roy Schieder, is a great the every man in this film and he is one of my favorite characters in film because he has to deal with the safety of his family, the safety of the town, and because of an ignorant mayor, is blamed for the death toll by the shark. Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper is also great (all the characters in this film are great) he is the funny character and not that he is comic relief, but him being the rich shark expert? genius, but the real humor that comes from him is  his interaction with Quint. Quint is the rough and grough shark hunter, played by Robert Shaw, he is the man who has his heart set on killing this fish, at his core he is character, he is a rip off of Captain Ahab, but where his character become his own is the back story given to him and the bosey loud performance, that is the stuff of legends.\n          The one this that truly the best thing in this film is the score by John Williams. The theme is simple, but it sticks with you through the years and has become one of the best and one of the most recognizable themes of all time. Also the script is great, it gives so much time developing these characters, and when the story looses a little bit of weight in some moments, the weight of the characters are able to carry it so well that at that point anything could have happened and I would have been totally invested. And the best part of this film is the fact that imagination is used to keep the shark alive, barrels, imagination and barrels. And when the shark does appear, its all the more power.\n        I love Jaws, I love everything about it, this fill is not for the general movie audience anymore, those looking to see cool shark moments where it eats people, will be disappointed, but those who want to be invested in characters and to overcome this ordeal, then you won't be disappointed.",

I think I first watched it back either 1985 or 1986 and made ever attempt to watch it when it was on television.  Although I didn't finally buy it until 2000, but the fact that it was TV all the time meant that I didn't have to.  The book the movie is based on sucked big time and I'm thankful the movie went against it.  The only problem I ever had with this film is I never saw it as a horror film.  Jaws has never scared me ever.  The film to me is more of an adventure film.  I don't mean any disrespect to those who love it as a horror movie, but that's how I feel about it.  Jaws should have won best picture back in 1975 and I cannot believe it lost.  But there's nothing I can do about it and just get over it.  This film will always be to me the greatest film of all-time.",

I liked the slow build up of the shark and how they used creative shots to show the threat of the shark without showing the shark as a whole.  I like how the movie was kind of split in two pieces, with the first half on land and dealing with the politics and hysteria of a town trying to deal with a disaster, while the second half was very man versus nature.  All of the town politics and rules and laws were left behind and it came down the the crew versus the shark; stark and simple by comparison.  I think it's a fairly well acted film as well, especially Robert Shaw's Quint.  I liked the history given to this character, as revealed out on the ocean while on the hunt.  This film is quite strong and I can see how it made the waves it did at the time of its release and why it remains talked about to this day.",

            "content": "I admittedly think Steven Spielberg is a rather overrated director - he seems to make quantity over quality - but boy, this film certainly falls into the quality category, and we need to remember this was one of the director's first few movies.\n\nIt amazes me that we got such a great film when there were a lot of problems on set, the most significant one being the mechanical shark not working properly. I believe they also weren't on schedule and definitely went over budget for this film. Spielberg was very clever to compensate for the mechanical shark though - he turned to suspense, a la Hitchcock, to frighten the audience by not actually showing the shark until halfway through the film, which was a brilliant decision. Who knows? Maybe the film would have seemed more quirky if more of the mechanical shark was shown if it wasn't malfunctioning.\n\nThe character development of Brody is simple, yet really strong and smart for the context of the movie. When you're up against a giant shark to defend an island community, what a train wreck it is to be afraid of the water. At the conclusion with the closing line \"I used to hate the water, I can't imagine why\" we know he's come full circle - if Brody can take on a monster of the sea, what makes you think water would still scare him?\n\nJaws also has some really good humor, a lot of it stemming from the character played by Richard Dreyfuss. The quirky shark-studier is a great character to balance out the tension between a man who wants to protect his community and a man who has a personal vendetta against sharks - who by the way delivers one of the best monologues in film history.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that Brody is blamed for the first couple of victims when the mayor of the town puts heavy pressure on Brody to keep the beaches open in order to turn a profit. It doesn't bother me in the sense that it is a bad aspect of the film, it just seems unfair, and you sort of sympathize with Brody since he wanted to protect the community and he let the community down. If anything, this is a great aspect of the film if it gets you to sympathize with Brody like it did for me.\n\nEven though this film is PG, maybe hold off on showing it to kids (unless they close their eyes at certain points) as it can upset them easily - I was terrified of Quint spurting out blood at the end of the film as a child. In general though, this is a movie everyone should see in their lifetime.",

            "content": "Let me tell you about one of the most important and successful films in cinema history. It was based on a novel by a first-time author. A Hollywood studio optioned the rights to the book even before its publication and then hired a director whose only other feature film had yet to be released and who later tried to back out of the job. The original screenwriter was the novel's author and he quit after producing three adaptations which were all rejected by the studio as inadequate. The novel was a surprise hit, but the director decided to drop or change several of the book's major plot points as well as the personalities of the main characters and the basic tone and focus of the story.  When the director first heard the core music for the film's score, he laughed, thinking it was a joke.\n\nLess than two weeks before production on the movie began, two of the three lead roles were yet to be cast. The script was worked on by several more people who declined screenwriting credit and was ultimately finished by one of the film's actors, who continued working on the script throughout production, often finishing writing scenes the evening before they were to be filmed. The young director stubbornly insisted on filming in a much more problematic setting than other available options. On set, persistent mechanical problems with the movie's key props forced the director to completely change how he wanted to shoot the movie - and caused the movie to go increasingly over budget and behind schedule. In the end, filming took nearly three times the number of allotted days and cost about two and a half times its original budget. Even then, the director insisted on shooting one more sequence that the studio refused to pay for, leading him to use his own money and shoot in a backyard swimming pool.\n\nWhen it came time to release the film, the studio gave it a wide release and opened it in the summertime, both of which were usually only done when the studio expected a movie to perform poorly at the box office. The movie I've been talking about is \"Jaws\", which opened on June 20, 1975. I guess you could say that everything turned out alright for this movie and the people who made it. More on that later. First, for those who haven't been fortunate enough to see it, a little about the movie itself.\n\n\"Jaws\" is the story of a single great white shark and the havoc it wreaks when it camps out in the waters off of the fictional New England resort called Amity Island. When a swimmer's mutilated remains are discovered on the beach, the town's new police chief (Roy Scheider) attempts to close the beaches, but is overruled by the town's mayor, who fears the impact on the town's economically crucial tourist season. After the shark claims some more victims, the beaches are finally closed, right on July 4th weekend. Chief Brody, visiting oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a grizzled local fisherman known as Quint (Robert Shaw) set out in Quint's boat, on a mission reminiscent of \"Moby Dick\". Whether for money (Quint), professional reasons (Hooper) or to protect his family and the rest of the town (Brody), the three men are determined to kill that shark - at any cost.\n\n\"Jaws\" is a very effective film which is part thriller and part monster movie. Whether originally planned this way or not, the limited number of times we actually see the shark builds the suspense, which is only further enhanced by the film's score. The shedding of some of the book's subplots, allows for better character development, which makes the characters both more interesting and more likeable than they were in the book. The movie's extras are mainly locals from the actual shooting location (Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts) and many of them have small speaking parts. Unfortunately, the overall quality of the acting suffers a bit from this heavy use of non-actors, but the especially strong performances from Scheider, Dreyfuss, Shaw and several others make up for it. The story's slowly building tension is punctuated by moments of sheer terror and even a few humorous moments, as well as some very memorable scenes and oft-quoted lines (\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\"), all of which makes \"Jaws\" one of the best balanced and most engaging horror thrillers in film history.\n\nNow, let me tell you a little bit more about one of the most important and successful films in cinema history. As mentioned earlier, things turned out alright for \"Jaws\" and the people who made the movie. That two note combination (E and F) that made Spielberg laugh when he first heard it played on the piano signaled the shark's presence throughout the movie and became one of the most recognizable pieces of music in the history of cinema. The composer, John Williams, went on to win an Oscar for his score and later said that \"Jaws\" jump-started his career. Speaking of which, Spielberg went on to become one of America's best-loved and most successful directors, earning seven Best Director Oscar nominations and eight Best Picture nominations as co-producer, winning Oscars for \"Schindler's List\" (Best Director and Best Picture) and \"Saving Private Ryan\" (Best Director). (Word is that he's also gotten better at shooting on schedule and within budget.)\n\n\"Jaws\" itself became the highest-grossing film in history, up to that time (holding the record for two years, until the release of \"Star Wars\"), and spawned three sequels and many forms of merchandising. Today, \"Jaws\" is considered the father of the summer blockbuster. The movie's marketing and release strategy has become the industry standard for big summer releases. Having said all that, regardless of the struggles overcome to bring this movie to theaters or the wide-ranging impact that it had on moviemaking overall, the most important thing about \"Jaws\" is that it's a damn fine movie that still holds up well today.",

The music by John Williams is a hundred percent one of the best features about the movie as a whole, especially with the classic shark suspense track. The three lead actors of this unforgettable film (especially Scheider and Dreyfuss) all play some of my top favorite characters out of most films. The suspense and the engagement are both considerably well done as the film gets more terrifying and also as it gets more fun and interesting. There's no underwater horror film out there that can ever top this classic in which it practically started a new phenomenon of good fearful movie watching.

            "content": "I have to say I'm a tiny bit annoyed right now that Jaws isn't listed under the horror category. Horror is a very under-appreciated genre and it deserves this movie. With that said, Jaws is my favorite horror movie. Just about every scene in this masterpiece can be taken apart and analyzed. You want to know how to scare an audience? Take a look at the scene where Brody is throwing chum in the water and Jaws pops up. So many points can be raised about that scene to illustrate how to do a jump scare right. And there's enough praise to go around for every actor involved. From the concerned and feeling powerless expression on Brody's face, to the youthful energy of Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw was born to play Quint. I like every movie Shaw has done, but this is his most noteworthy role. He plays it so well the first time I watched the movie I thought maybe they found a real fisherman who lived in Amity and they really paid him to hunt their shark. Speaking of the shark, it looks very authentic. Roger Ebert once said Speilberg told him the secret to bring a puppet to life is by putting emphasis on the eyes, and he's right. Too many monster movies hide the eyes of their monster because the eyes are the hardest part to make look realistic, but they're the most important part, which Spielberg has proven with E.T. and Jaws. Besides the great acting and special effects, the music is very important, too, maybe even more so than everything else. My opinion is with horror, and with all genres to some extent, the music is the key factor and many movies fail because of neglect in the music department. Look at all the popular horror movies: Jaws, Halloween, Friday The 13th, The Exorcist, and so on. They all have soundtracks that are awesome, creepy and get stuck in your head. Now look at good horror movies that aren't so popular, like Child's Play and Hellraiser. I would argue that Child's Play is a better horror movie than Friday The 13th, but it has no memorable music so the movie is forgettable. Look at how virtually all modern horror movies have lazy music and are forgettable. Well, it's hard to make a good soundtrack when it's interrupted constantly by jump scares. Anyway, enough about my movie theories. Jaws is the Citizen Kane of horror movies and everyone should see it at least once.",

There is just something about Jaws, overall I think it is just great storytelling, and sure the shark looks fake when looked at now, but for its time no one thunk it. Jaws also gave us one of the best conversations ever put on film, where they compare wounds and then Quint talks about the ship going down and being stuck in the water for days with sharks everywhere, it just has so much weight to it. I also think that this is probably one of Spielbergs best films, I am sure that can be debated, but I know it is one of my favorites and will always hold a special place in my heart, plus I can always hear the music when swimming in open water, Du Dum, Du Dum, Du Dum, Du du du du du du AHHHHHHH.\n5 Beards Out Of 5\nCheck out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RMTlZrCzGQ",

But like all classics, it doesn't matter how many tryhard attempts at recreating a masterpiece appear on our cinema screens, there is no denying the pure injection of fear which comes from watching Steven Spielberg's masterpiece; Jaws.\n\nThe story takes place in a sunbaked little town called Amity Island, a town which lives for the summer because the tourists come to town. But things are thrown into disarray when new-to-town Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) discovers the victim of a shark attack on one of the beaches. Unwilling to lose the influx of customers as a result of the tourist season, Mayor Vaughn decides to keep the beaches open. After the attacks continue, however, Chief Police Brody, icthyologist (read: shark nerd) Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and local shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), unite to hunt the shark down.\n\nSteven Spielberg is the man to be thanking for this masterpiece. Without him, the film could have turned into an uninteresting shark fest which would work for shock value but wouldn't have the devastating impact that it still has today. What could have been a string of disjointed set-pieces is put together brilliantly to make this film one of the greatest horrors of all time. The mystery and restraint shown by Spielberg throughout the film is reason enough to call him a genius, not to mention the expert characterisation which he cleverly weaves in here and there. Each of our characters are fleshed out and 3-dimensional, as well as being equal parts loveable and frustrating. The perfect use of music, the incredible camerawork, the nerve shredding moments of fear, all of it is put together seamlessly by a master at work. There are moments of pure shock and there are moments of extended tension which will have you tearing at the cushion which you hold for comfort. One thing's for certain, it keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe acting in this film is far over and above what you'd get in today's cookie-cutter horrors. Roy Scheider is great as Police Chief Martin Brody. He shows the incredible frustration which his character feels as he is overruled again and again by a man motivated by greed. He shows that he can do humour as well, with wry lines like \"He's in the yard not too far from the car.\" But while he is great as our lead, It's Richard Dreyfuss who steals the show as the more-than-slightly hyperactive Matt Hooper. Like an over-caffinated obsessive-compulsive, Dreyfuss inhabits his character perfectly, showing his indignation, his frustration and his fear with a childlike exuberance which makes him such a likeable character. Robert Shaw plays the almost crazy shark hunter Quint and is fantastic in his role. He mumbles, working class hero-like through his lines \"You go in the cage, cage goes in the water, you go in the water? Shark's in the water. Our shark.\" with a perfect condescending feel which suits his character to a tee. The comradery between these three characters is one of the best parts of the film, and as three initially different characters begin to accept and even embrace one another for their differences, you can almost forget that there is a monster shark on the loose. This is a tribute to not only Spielberg for luring us into a false sense of security, but the realistic relaxation by the actors onscreen which double the effect.\n\nEvery part of this brilliant film works together perfectly in order to create this incredible experience. Yes, accidents on set did make scary scenes even scarier and the experience made Spielberg vow to never film on open sea again, but there's not too many films which can boast that an audience ran out of the cinema, into the bathroom, threw up, and ran back inside to keep watching the test screening. It's a morbidly fascinating and pants-wettingly scary film which have you steering clear of beaches for some time, yet coming back for repeat viewings over and over again.\n\nDefining Scene:\nThat brilliant first death sequence. The combination of John Williams infamous strings and Spielberg's fantastic direction makes this scene unforgettable.",

That's actually the premise and what happens through most of the movie, but it's all so incredibly varied and engaging that this is actually a hard flick to categorize. It's an horror movie at times, a satyrical take on summer villages, an adventure movie later on with sort of Moby Dickian aspirations on some dialogues, amongst other delicious details. Not sure if Spielberg created the modern blockbuster here because of all the above reasons. All I know, is that Jaws is an excellent movie that does many many things right, both on a technical and storytelling levels.",

Loosely based on a series of shark attacks off the Jersey Shore in 1916, Jaws is the [shark]tail of a picturesque New England island plagued by a series of brutal shark attacks, and the relentless pursuit of said shark by the police chief, a marine biologist and a rouge fisherman. Spielberg overcame numerous setbacks and achieved legendary status with a \"less-is-more formula\" so hard to emulate now it's near mythical. Building up the suspense and turning the screws unbearably tightly in the first half, Jaws then comes full circle and nudges into all-out horror for its second half. The fact that it is also a finely-nuanced, character-driven drama is due to Bruce's constant malfunctions, forcing Spielberg to improvise a little subtlety. We all know how it turned out in the end...",

Great risk led to great reward, though, as this is now regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films of all-time. This was Spielberg's trial by fire, and he succeeded. Today, we look back on his career - Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones films, E.T., The Color Purple, Schindler's List, Minority Report, Lincoln - and it's rare to find a filmmaker who's carved out such consistent quality for so long. Greatness had to start somewhere, though, and it began with Jaws.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2014/08/05/benjamins-stash-31/",

The tension keeps building to an almost unbearable level as three men face off against a demonic great white shark in a small fishing boat in the middle of the ocean! I almost had a heart attack during the final scene. This is almost a horror film, and if it was any gorier it would be. All of the acting is superb in this, in particular Robert Shaws performance as  an eccentric sea caption with a personal score to settle with the shark.\nThe movie feels very grounded and realistic, with lots of hand held camera shots and a somewhat simple, yet effective premise. The town does not want to lose money during the busy tourist season, and refuse to close the beaches even though the shark has taken out several people including a woman and a little boy. The musical score in this film is so iconic that it is instantly recognizable even to people who have never seen the film before,  and creates a brooding tension and dread that creeps up on you. There are moments also when no music accompanies the sharks arrival, making the shock and terror even more profound. This is the way thrillers are done folks! It is a gripping, nervously funny, and terrifying cinematic gem from one of the greatest directors of all time Steven Spielberg!",

Jaws is without a doubt one of Spielberg's   classics thanks to its well acted cast, tensioned suspense, gruesome and offscreen death scenes, a final and memorable act, and of course the always impressive great white: Jaws.

I missed John Williams' phenomenal score, that only complements the fear and desperation that the great white invokes.  I missed special effects that prove CGI always is not the best thing (look at Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus).  Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss are compelling to watch as the three that finally take down the dreaded predator.  As the police chief, Scheider is solid, invoking a sense of authority while being haunted by his past fear of the sea.  Richard Dreyfuss' enthusiasm as the shark expert is infectious.  Robert Shaw as Quint brings an unhinged bravery to the role of Quint.  These three together at the end are great and kept the momentum of the movie going.  Before the hunt we were greeted by scenes of fear and political ineptitude.  The blood, screams, and fear of sharks are all things that 'Jaws' boasts.  This was Spielberg when he kept it simple.  This is when he would not focus on a bloated plot or soaring emotions.",

This clashes delightfully with the wild, climactic ending, which is exciting, terrifying, and one of the best climaxes I've ever seen.  And the fun, colorful characters played by Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw are arguably the best part of the film.  Under the direction of Spielberg, all of these elements come together for the perfect storm that is \"Jaws\".\n\nDespite being more of a suspense-thriller, \"Jaws\" laid the groundwork for the wave of horror films that followed it.  It is a film that can take you completely by surprise or make you jump at nothing.

            "content": "That's right, until July 2014 I had never seen Jaws. I approached it with some trepidation because, even without seeing the movie, pop culture has made me aware of the general plotline. Not to mention the fact that I had seen several scenes from the film (including the final climactic moment.) So, being fully aware of so much before watching, I was afraid that it would not be able to impact me in any way. I could not have been more wrong! Spielberg deserves every accolade he has received for this movie because every piece of the puzzle that goes into constructing the scenes was perfectly thought out in order to create amazing tension. For instance in that final climax, even though I had literally seen this part of the film before, I was on the edge of my seat and holding my breath. A big part of that is the script. It is built just right, with enough moments between the action that allow us to catch our breath and become invested in the characters. Even Quint, easily the least likable of the main characters has a moment where you see some of what made him the man he is today, and you can't help rooting for him because of this. \n\nThe trio of lead actors are a perfect mix of personalities and I like the performances we get from Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw. It is vital in a film of this kind that we become connected with the protagonists so we can feel like a part of their struggle to beat this shark, and the high-quality acting helps a lot. But the most impressive aspect of Jaws is the stress Spielberg creates in the audience. After only seeing one death scene in the opening, somehow they filled me with uneasiness every moment someone is in or even near the water. And, even though I tried, I can't pinpoint one aspect that made me feel this way. Was it the score? The lighting? The reaction shots from the actors? I just don't know, but even in scenes where there was clearly no danger I was still worried that any time a shark could pop up and the ocean would fill with red. I understand that after this movie came out there were people who literally became nervous about swimming in pools or even taking a bath, and I totally understand that. This kind of strong excitement and anticipation is something I rarely experience when I watch movies, it takes something truly special. I have a feeling that, with a few more viewings, Jaws could become one of my favorite films of all time and I could boost this rating to a perfect 5 stars. I wish I could see it on a big screen. \"Must see\" is not a strong enough recommendation for this movie!",

And yes, the rubber mechanical shark still looks a bit dodgy. It looked dodgy back then as well, however, which is why the captain of this ship hid it away until nearly the end of the film...well, that and the fact that it luckily kept breaking, that is. Granted, Jaws didn't invent the genre. In fact, the film employs a Hitchcockian style of suspense in building up to a slowburn reveal of the actual shark. And, at its heart, the film remains a first-rate monster movie that often baits its audience from the creature's underwater point of view in the tradition of Universal horror classic The Creature from the Black Lagoon. Indeed, a certain soon-to-be legendary director knew his film history which is a major reason why he became a part of film history. Because of his vision, all aspects - from letter perfect performances to expertly written script to powerful score to masterful direction - amount to a ridiculously exhilarating scaremaker of the highest order--then, now, and for years to come.\r\n\r\nIn this surprisingly PG-rated thriller, a police chief (Roy Sheider), marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss), and seasoned fisherman (Robert Shaw) set out to stop a gigantic great white that's threatening the island town of Amity during its busiest tourist season.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the legendary technical problems that plagued the process, the production also boasted a weapons grade talent who still would've been on a superstar trajectory whether the mechanical shark worked or not. Indeed, the path to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., The Color Purple, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Lincoln may've been different without Jaws, but this director was always bound for greatness. Spielberg cut his teeth on television (Rod Serling's Night Gallery, Marcus Welby, M.D.) and already had a few flicks under his belt (Duel, Sugarland Express), but consider that his landmark filmmaking touchstones were already in full effect in Jaws. Framing ordinary people in extraordinary situations. Maintaining humanity and morals while facing inhuman terror. Finding humor even in the most horrific of moments. Zoom-in close ups of his star's awe-struck faces. It's all there, along with soon-to-be frequent collaborators John Williams (giving us an unforgettable - admit it, it's playing in your head right now - score) and Richard Dreyfuss (giving us a quirky career-making performance). Roy Scheider, who Spielberg admired in another '70s classic called The French Connection, brings an authentic feel to the lead character, Police Chief Brody, which grounds the drama all the more. Luckily, the script developed the players beyond caricatures. Perhaps, no character evinces this more than Robert Shaw's Quint, who turns from a salty son of a sea cook into a tortured survivor with one speech that gets burned into your mind forever from the first time you hear it. When talk came of Jaws 2, Spielberg initially wanted nothing to do with the inevitable sequel. At one point during pre-production of the film, however, he reportedly entertained one possibility. What if they made it a prequel based solely on Quint's searing USS Indianapolis speech, a chilling first-hand account of hundreds of sailors getting picked off by sharks in icy waters following their vessel getting torpedoed that was written by writer/director John Milius (Conan the Barbarian, Red Dawn)? The sharks at Universal, of course, said 'no.' Perhaps, this muted prequel idea remains one of H'Wood's greatest unfulfilled coulda-beens. Without this follow-up, we'll just have to make do with the scary near perfection of Jaws. Lucky us.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Here's to STILL swimming with bow-legged women",

            "content": "Director Steven Spielberg put himself on the map with his famed father of summer blockbusters on June 20, 1975.  The highest-grossing film in history at the time of its release, Jaws established a formula for future summer pictures to follow, which places greater focus on high concept premises and action-adventure.\n   Its story is based on the novel of the same by Peter Benchley.  A great white shark begins to terrorize swimmers at a small New England resort town, and the police chief, Brody (Roy Scheider, The French Connection), responds by closing the beaches. But, as the profitable Fourth of July is fast approaching, Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) reopens them, allowing the shark to continue wreaking havoc upon the shoreline. When the shark attacks Brody's son, Brody, oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfus, American Graffiti), and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw, From Russia with Love) set out to sea to destroy the beast.\n    Jaws's three leads are sharply written and possess strong personalities that sometimes band them together and sometimes drive them apart. The interactions between them and other characters are precise, unique and nuanced; they all feel real.  However, while the scholarly Hooper and crusty Quint have acquired sea legs and have exciting professions, Scheider's Brody is the everyman caught in the middle of an extraordinary conflict, an archetype that Spielberg now commonly employs.  He is a man who knows what is right, but finds himself chained by society's foolishness and, as a result, more deaths follow.  Thus, Brody's motivations for destroying the shark are both personal and moral - he intends to right his past wrongs and protect his family and town. Plus, he's scared of water, and that's definitely not helpful in a movie that spends a lot of time in the open ocean.\n   The action is endlessly thrilling.  As the mechanical shark suffered from a multitude of technical problems, it remains hidden for most of the movie, and that makes Jaws incredibly powerful.  Because the human mind has the tendency to fear the unknown, the shark becomes more than just a monster; it becomes a dark, ominous presence implied by John Williams's superb score and attacks seen from its point of view, causing us to construct a horror beyond comprehension within our own minds.  In a stroke of genius, the camera focuses only on the panicked thrashing of the first victim (Susan Backlinie) and her piercing screams, her desperate pleads to God - the death is brutal because we see and feel her fear. Gore is sparsely used, but when it does appear, it is all the more shocking.  Spielberg makes us wait until we see the shark for the first time, building suspense and excitement all the way to the climactic battle. And yes, while the shark has a habit of looking like the robot it is whenever its head fully emerges from the water, one can't deny that it is an impressive feat of engineering that mostly fulfills its purpose during its brief screen time during the film's final act.\n   Spielberg's shark flick is also a lot deeper than people credit it to be. Quint, a character just as greedy as the mayor, seeks to exploit the town's money in return for catching the shark. He is in the quest for glory, selfish desire, and to fulfill a personal vendetta against all sharks, so it's no coincidence that he's the only lead character who perishes.  The shark itself represents the force of nature and shares a relationship to Quint similar to the one between Moby Dick and Captain Ahab.  It attacks people not because it is evil, but because it is just an animal seeking to survive. Humans in the film, and real life, habitually tempt fate, venturing into regions where they have no right to be, regions occupied by other living creatures, regions where interactions between man and beast are inevitable. Instead of understanding this as an inevitability, humans, like Quint, seek to right perceived wrongs by creatures seen as evil only because that concept is assigned to them. With that in mind, the movie is less black and white than it seems. Like the great Shakespearean plays, Jaws holds a mirror up to us and forces us to truly examine ourselves.\n   Jaws is an ambitious, adventurous and masterful film that takes a deceptively simple concept and executes it to the highest degree through iconic performances, fantastic spectacle, and excellent mood-building devices. It is one of those rare movies that makes us forget about reality and draws us in completely. Though Spielberg and his daring crew battled numerous setbacks and failures during a long, arduous shoot, the film remains triumphant to this day because its creators came up with creative ways to overcome its problems. Perhaps more so than any of its peers, Jaws is very much the definition of \"art through adversity.\"",

It also put a then unknown Steven Spielberg on the map as a skillful director.  Humorously, though, JAWS went through a LOT of difficulties during production period, mainly on account of a \"mechanical\" shark that malfunctioned more often than not.  But you wouldn't know this from watching the end result.  The film is tightly edited (using whatever \"usable\" footage of said shark could be used), and arguably benefits from a lot of moments where we don't actually see the shark as it stalks its next victim, but follow its point of view.  (This was mainly due to complications with the technology back then.)  But it was John Williams' foreboding, thumping score that really set the tone for this energetic thriller.  Having said all this, what really makes JAWS is the dynamic between Roy Schieder, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw as the heroic trio who set out to kill the shark.  All three are fleshed out as compelling, interesting characters that allows the audience to identify with them, making the grand climax all the more satisfactory.  JAWS spawned three (dubious) sequels of degrading quality, but the original remains a classic, and deservedly so.",

First, The acting was superb, particularly the interplay between Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. It doesn't hurt that they are played by three highly skilled actors and supported by a script that snaps with great dialog and, for about the last forty minutes, non-stop tension. The most notable example is the long (but not drawnout) scene in the Orca when the three discuss their fears and motivations for catching the shark. \r\n\r\nSecond, the deirection by Spielberg.  Spielberg takes a lot of time for character development, but he doesn't lump it all together at the beginning of the filmScenes like Brody's son mocking Brody's expressions at the dinner table, or Quint's speech about why he hunts sharks, are crucial to understanding the motivations of characters, but Spielberg makes sure they come at times where a release of tension is needed.\r\n\r\nFinally, the ingenious music that John Williams composed for the film, especially the two note theme that announces the impending arrival shark, which has become part of our pop culture. Other production aspects deserve mentions as well, from Bill Butler's superb cinematography to the mechanical shark itself, which, despite the well-known tales of it not working most of the time, still looks menacing.\r\n\r\nJaws is one of the best monster movies ever made simply because it takes time to explore the human side of its story.  It is a penetrating drama, a kind of throwback to 1950's monster films.  It influenced films such as Alien and  Deep Blue Sea, whether in the general construction of story, the setting, or more literal takes on a monster in a closed environment. Even if this weren't the case, Jaws would still be essential viewing for anyone serious about film.",

No entanto, saber se o talento existe é uma tarefa mais simples. Basta que se faça muito com pouco! É certo que este lema é injustamente inserido em muitas categorias onde não deveria estar, mas, no que diz respeito ao cinema, é quase irrefutável. Steven Spielberg fê-lo. Jaws é um filme com recursos escassos. Contudo,isso só serviu para extrair o génio de todos os envolvidos na película, sobretudo do realizador, que deixou bem gravada a sua marca, a qual o tornaria num dos mais influentes e bem sucedidos realizadores de todos os tempos.\nNuma época em que o cinema de terror, tal como o conhecemos hoje, dava os seus primeiros passos, Jaws foi uma novidade avassaladora.\nA história é simples: um tubarão, em pleno arranque das festividades do 4 de Julho, ataca uma ilha onde habita uma sociedade pacata, desacostumada a esse tipo de perigos. Passada a fase da relutância em não querer admitir que se trata efectivamente de um tubarão, não resta outra alternativa senão caçá-lo. \nIntenso, assustador e com uma história muito bem escrita, é fácil perceber por que razão o filme de Spielberg se tornou um clássico.\nMas o que torna o filme eterno é a sua banda sonora, criada pelo fantástico John Williams. Todos reconhecerão certamente o som do trombone que assinala a chegada do predador dos mares...\nOutra característica interessante do filme é a sua intemporalidade.\nVisto hoje ou daqui a dez anos, manter-se-á sempre o suspense e a experiência continuará na mesma gratificante.

            "content": "A string of fatal shark attacks have beached on Amity Island's doorstep in the week leading up to the 4th of July weekend, the Island's biggest tourist attraction of the year. Local Deputy of Chief Police, Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider), struggles to get the Mayor to understand that the beaches must be closed to prevent any more deaths. Unfortunately, Mayor Larry Vaughn fears the opposite; closing the beaches will ruin Amity Island's summer tourist season, the town's primary income source for the year.\n\nIt's not long into the film before we and the terrified people of Amity Island discover that this creature of the sea is not one to be messed with. Unseen for the majority of the film (mainly the first half) Steven Spielberg creates a fear of the unknown. And who doesn't fear the unknown? Clever use of the camera and iconic musical score hints that danger is nearby but for the poor guy on screen, they have no idea what's lurking underneath them. It captures the feeling of helplessness I have every time I swim in the ocean, or even when I was younger just in the local swimming pool. Maybe it was Jaws that made me feel this in the first place!\n\nThroughout the film, floating objects are used to portray the sharks sense of direction. One scene in particular shows an old wooden dock being snapped out of place and dragged out to sea by the shark before turning and charging back to a panicking swimmer. By using the wooden dock not only can we see the unknown but also register it's sheer strength. It's a monster.\n\nI had to wonder who the 'villain' of this film really is. The man-eating killer shark  doing what it can to get by or the 'putting everyone's life in stake for profit' Mayor. One shocking scene halfway through the film shows a crowded beach with nobody in the water. The Mayor walks over to a friend, a father with his family, and forces them to get in. They do so unwillingly, their faces read pure fear but eventually it leads to a sea filled buffet for the shark (I don't refer to the shark as Jaws because that's just the name of the film, not the shark itself). It may be shocking but it was a shockingly great way to make the Mayor even more of a douche.\n\nMartin Brody soon teams up with shark enthusiast Matt Hooper and shark hunter Quint. There's some tension between them which is escalated with the fact they are alone on a small boat out in the ocean. It creates exciting chemistry when they are risking their lives trying to catch this beast. Despite having more camera time in this part of the movie, the shark looks and moves incredibly well for a film from the 70?s. It definitely still holds up today.\n\nIt's been almost 40 years since it's release and still Jaws remains as one of the best suspense/thriller film ever released. If you haven't seen this film for whatever reason you need to check it out. If you've already seen it before, maybe it's time to watch it again.",

Based on the novel by Peter Benchley, this film is one of the most terrifying films of all times. The big star: a man-eating great white shark (in reality a huge mechanic dummy). I really love this film; it's man versus nature, and it music composition by the genius John Williams (everyone knows the tune) is absolutely nerve-racking. The movie was so successful that it got three more sequels and formed an inspiration for many other shark-movies. In the main cast we have Roy Scheider (the French Connection), Robert Shaw (From Russia With Love), Richard Dreyfuss (Close Encounters of the Third Kind) and Lorainne Gary (Jaws franchise). A classic to put your teeth in. \n\nWhen Amilty Island's Sheriff Martin Brody (Scheider) finds the remains of a girl who was attacked by a shark when she went skinny-dipping in the night, he wants to close down the beach for swimmers. But that's against the will of the local business people, who make a living by the summer tourists, so the mayor denies Brody's request. Shortly after that, the Sheriff and his wife Ellen (Gary) witness several other attacks. One almost killed their son Michael. With this many casualties, something needs to be done. Brody joins the local shark hunter Quint (Shaw) and Marine biologist Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss) to track the shark down.  The three men set out on the vessel Orca and plan on killing the terrifying sea creature...",

Without a doubt jaws is one of the best films ever and it's my personal favorite Spielberg movie. The main cast is absolutely amazing and all of the acting is fantastic, even the child acting. Roy Scheider is fantastic in this film, he's a very like able character and you really feel for him when no one really listens to him at the start of the film. He's one of the best characters ever put to film. Richard the Dreyfuss is also fantastic, he's a very likable character also and he's quite funny as well. Robert Shaw is one of the most likeable assholes in film history, I love the character of Quint, he's a pretty badass character and I love some of his lines. The actress who plays Chief Brody's wife is great, I forget her name but she's brilliant. This film is amazingly directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg, considering how many problems there were with the production of this film it's amazing how well Spielberg was able to direct this film. It's actually quite inspirational. The script and editing for this film are flawless. This film is a masterpiece in suspense and tension, it's fantastic and has you on the edge of your seat. Without a doubt though the thing that makes the film so tense is not the scary shark attacks it's the music. John Williams score is absolutely amazing, it's tense and foreboding and just makes all the shark attacks amazing. The score is so brilliant and it's one of the best scores ever put to film. This movie is full of iconic scenes, like the amazing and probably my favorite scene in the movie is where Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint are on the boat, they drink, they laugh, they show scars and then Quint tells his story about the Indianapolis and the Sharks eyes, it's an amazing scene and is fantastically acted by Robert Shaw. There are so many other great scenes also like the iconic and terrifying opening, the shark attack scene with the boy on the raft or the touching scene where Chief Brody and his son copy each other and pull faces, it's a cute scene and a very. Touching scene. One of the great things about this movie that everyone talks about is how they hide the shark for the first hour. This could have easily back fired but it works so well. The big reveal of the shark is great and leads to one of the most iconic lines of all time. Overall Jaws is a masterpiece of a film, it's one of the best movies ever made and it's a fantastic horror movie. It's without a doubt one of my favourite movies and in my top 10 of all time. A+",

Scheider is asking again if they need a bigger boat and there's a very odd scene transition that fades down his dialogue as he's speaking. I thought John Williams didn't really know what he should be doing during one sequence when the three protagonists are chasing the shark, the music has more of a free-spirited high-adventure tone and it struck me as dissonant with the action onscreen. And, this might just be a matter of my own taste, but I really hated the scene when the mother of the young boy who was killed confronts Scheider's character. I imagine he does feel responsible but the lady is way off and she receives no rebuttal (a mother in grieving doesn't get challenged, I guess), and that sort of thing gets on my nerves. Another pet peeve of mine, the film hasn't a denouement to really speak of. Pretty much other than that it is a great movie and I think well deserving of its place in cinema history.",

It is well written, interesting, and just great. Maybe the first act is a bit slow moving, but it gives us important character moments, and leads us up to bigger and better things to come.

In this case about the inadequacy of the efforts of this flawed hero to protect people. The rows of broken and derelict fences reflect Brody's futile efforts to defend the community from the leviathan threatening them. (yeah, i got a bit pretentious, I know) As much as I love this movie, I still hate watching poor Mrs. Kitner. :( And I admit the shark at the end is a bit silly but I don't care even a little. And Quint. Can we talk about how awesome Robert Shaw is for a second? Quint his hilarious, has a powerful presence, and is oh so entertaining. The three guys play off of each other so well. The last act at sea is so fun. \n\nThe cinematography and editing are brilliant. Especially at the Alex Kitner attack scene, When Brody is nervously watching the water and there's all those false alarms. The way it's shot and edited with the wipes moving closer to Brody so quickly really set the tense mood. That guy blocks our shot and Brody's view.

Adding to that intensity is John Williams brilliant score, without his score most of these scenes wouldn't have been as suspenseful. Williams's score is also one of the best in film history. Like I said in my review for The Exorcist you would expect some dated effects, but the effects for Jaws hold up entirely because they are so incredible. Jaws's screenplay is quite riveting because of it's engaging story, well written dialogue, and cool characters that the audience can actually care about. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss all give wonderful performances as the main heroes of this extraordinary blockbuster along with an amazing supporting cast. Jaws isn't just one of the best blockbusters ever made, but one of the best movies ever made. If you have not had the opportunity to see Jaws yet than get on it immediately because it is one of those movies that you must see before you die.",

(I'm starting to fall in love with Richard Dreyfuss).\nJust as the first month of summer has gone but, the chief of police for the town of Amity believes there may be a shark roaming the main waters of where the townspeople typlically swim in. After the second attack and kill of a young boy, the town is certain there is a shark, and Chief Brody (Scheider), professional fisherman Quint (Shaw), and oceanographer and lover of sharks Hooper (Dreyfuss) must set sail to kill this shark once and for all.\nEven though it takes a little more than half the movie to get to the climatic scenes out at sea, the first half of the film is riveting. The mayor of the town is worried that the townspeople may get cranky and want to leave for another beach that doesn't have shark and for the mayor, that means a loss in revenue and reputation.\nThis film is so riveting and greatly written. I don't think there was ever a dull moment.\nIs it just me or does Roy Scheider have a close resemblance to James Woods?\nOverall, this film even made me scared at the jump out moments, and I greatly enjoyed this classic film. I am glad I finally watched it.\nJaws, I give you a 90%.",

Unlike most blockbusters these days, however, this film was not just an efficient money-maker to draw in audiences, but was one of the most beloved tales about man and his disadvantaged battle against nature in its most primal and deadly form.  An indisputable classic that has rightfully been remembered, and suffers little from its old-fashioned effects and the fact that the shark is just a large piece of rubber.

            "content": "In 1975, a relatively unknown director at the time, Steven Spielberg decided to make a movie like no other about a man-eating shark. The project proved to be extremely difficult, with many huge delays to difficulties in operating the mechanical, animatronic shark. There were tons of production delays and due to going way over-budget, Spielberg thought this was the end of his filmmaking career and many thought the film was going to be the biggest disaster in the history of film. When Jaws was released however, audiences were wowed and scared by it, breaking many records, and this film, along with George Lucas's Star Wars, are credited for the founding of the summer blockbuster. It also made Spielberg one of the most successful directors of all-time, creating other acclaimed films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, and ET.  How does Jaws rank up today compared to modern blockbusters as The Avengers and Lord of the Rings? Well, it's still an amazing, horror thrill ride.\r\n\r\nJaws begins when a great white shark attacks a female skinny dipper at a late-night party. When her remains appear on the beach, Amity police chief Brody (Roy Scheider) intends to close the beaches, but mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), believing that news of the shark attack will hurt the beach business during 4th of July weekend, dismisses it (\"When you say shark, then we've got a panic on our hands on the 4th of July.\"). After several more shark attacks, the Mayor eventually agrees for a major shark hunt. Shark hunters catch a shark, but it's discovered that it's not the shark who attacked. So then, Brody, shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), and marine biologist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) go on an epic mission to kill the shark before it attacks again.\r\n\r\nAlso, Lorraine Gray plays Ellen Brody, Brody's wife and Craig Kingsbury plays Ben Gardner, a shark hunter who gets attacked and shows up in a famous jump scene.\r\n\r\nJaws was the film that launched the massive directing career of Steven Spielberg, even though he had made films prior, such as The Sugarland Express. His honors over the years are well deserved, cause it still remains one of his best films. Spielberg has returned to the horror/suspense genre again with films like Jurassic Park and Temple of Doom, but Jaws remains to this day his definitive horror masterpiece.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the shark was going to be seen more, but due to the mechanical difficulties of the animatronic shark, Spielberg decided to pull an Alfred Hitchcock, where the shark wouldn't be seen at all until towards the end. That concept really makes the film work in it's thrills. I enjoyed the fears and tensions that the shark was going to show up, and it turned out to be a false alarm, and then, the shark shows up finally, which makes Jaws a true horror icon. Now, when we actually see the shark, the mechanicalness of the shark feels a little cheesy and dated in today's times, but the suspense still carries on to where you don't care at all if the shark is a mechanical shark.\r\n\r\nFor a horror film, there's some fun humor as well, particularly in the scenes on the boat. When the shark shows up for the first time, Brody tells the captain, Quint, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" Another instance. when Brody and Quint are arguing, Hooper mentions, \"Oh boys! I think he's back for his noon feeding.\" I also love the part where Hooper crushes a plastic cup in anger due to frustration over finding the shark. These scenes make us care for the three main characters and their intentions to kill the shark once and for all. \r\n\r\nThe casting is also spectacular. Roy Scheider is great as Chief Brody, and I love the fact that he's scared of the water, making his character the more entertaining. Richard Dreyfuss is also well-cast as scientist Brody, and the scene where he goes into a shark cage is one of the most suspenseful sequences in the film, and possibly, film history. The one who really steals the show is Robert Shaw as Quint, the crazy shark hunter. Cleary inspired by Captain Ahab from Moby Dick, Shaw gives it his all and gives us some chilling speeches, particularly a sequence where he tells the audience about his encounter with sharks on the USS Indianapolis, which is based on a real life incident that occurred during WWII. That speech there gives me goosebumps and is just as suspenseful as the shark scenes. \r\n\r\nAnd speaking of shark scenes, none of the shark scenes would have worked without the score by my all-time favorite composer, John Williams, who became a longtime Spielberg collaborator after the massive success of Jaws. The Jaws theme, which consists of only two notes, is the biggest reason why Jaws works so well in the suspense department. It's dark, creepy, and awesome. There's also some cool, adventure, piratey music that shows up throughout the film that's also a highlight. This is one of Williams's best scores ever, and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Score.\r\n\r\nJaws remains a horror landmark, a Spielberg classic, and one of my all-time favorite films. I'm not a big fan of the horror genre, as the overuse on gore has caused the genre to go massively downhill, but Jaws, like Psycho, maintains the level of suspense and scares that creates what an essential horror film should be. No wonder why many people were scared of going back into the water. (I'm not one of these, however.)\r\n\r\n\"Smile you son of a...!\"",

Jaws is based off Peter Benchley's book and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw. Jaws is a movie that gets better everytime I see it and is one of my favorite movies ever. Easily the best thing about this movie are the characters. They are very likable and you don't want them to be eaten by the shark. Speaking of the shark, you don't see the shark that much mostly because the mechanical shark would not work most of the time, but Spielberg was careful not to show too much of the shark. The way you can tell that the shark is around is the music by John Williams. John Williams music is absolutely fantastic and it is one of the best scores for a movie ever.I think my favorite scene from Jaws is when Chief Brody, Quint, and Hooper are talking to each other and they show their scars and Quint talks about a bone chilling story and then they sing and suddenly the shark attacks the boat. Spielberg has said that is his favorite scene from Jaws and every scene is fantastic. Jaws is truly my favorite horror movie and one of my favorite movies ever.",

Outstanding in almost every way- a taught thriller about a summer town collapsing under the shadow of terror. The politics of the situation is merely hinted at in this adaptation of Benchley's novel, but the film is full of wit, wonder and brilliantly realised characters- there are small moments, unpolished, that give Jaws it's heart and there are some sobering moments too- John Milias provides Robert Shaw's Quint with a beautiful soliloquy on his first shark encounter, while Scheider and Dreyfuss shine under Spielberg's masterful direction. Williams score is more terrifying than any beast could be, which may be just as well given that Bruce (the shark) hasn't aged well. Not that it matters- this is still a landmark of cinema because of the quality of direction, cinematography, screenplay and that music. In my opinion, the greatest film ever made.",

It could easily delve into cheesy territory in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, but Spielberg shows why he is the master of spectacle. The film strikes a fantastic balance in tone, often juggling high tension and humor without missing a beat. Enough can't be said about the superb camerawork and tight editing, which ratchet up the drama and horror that still stand the test of time.\n\nOn repeated viewings, I've come to really appreciate how clever the writing is in Jaws. There's a bevy of jokes, but scenes such as the dinner where Roy Scheider sits with his young son are so delicate and powerful without the help of any animatronics (It's perfectly followed up by Richard Dreyfuss stopping by, jokingly asking the Chief how his day was, to which Chief Brody responds \"Swell\"--you can't top that).\n\nThe film takes an ill-fitting whimsical tone upon entering the high seas, which is a minor distraction (especially with that section of John Williams' score), but other than that it's a true blockbuster for the ages.",

It is a mindless eating machine that will attack and devour anything. It is as if god created the devil, or basically itâs based on author Peter Benchleyâs bestselling 1974 novel and was later adapted into a feature film by a young filmmaker named Steven Spielberg (E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan), who was chosen by Producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, to direct Universal Picturesâ 1975 horror/thriller classic JAWS.  Before codifying with 1977âs Sci-Fi classic STAR WARS, This was the film that set the standard for the new Hollywood popcorn blockbuster while frightening moviegoers out of the water and would become one of the greatest movies of all time.  In the summer resort Town of Amity Island, swimmers are being killed by a gigantic great white shark. In order to stop this horrific monster from killing more victims, it will take Amityâs water hating Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), grizzled local shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), and wisecracking Marine scientist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to hunt it down. The film also stars Murray Hamilton (The Graduate) as Amityâs ignorant Mayor Larry Vaughn, Lorraine Gray (1941) as Martinâs wife Ellen Brody, and author Peter Benchley making a cameo appearance as a television interviewer. My parents were around their early 20âs when this film came out that summer, and I would never see it till I was eleven years old on the year of its 25th anniversary in 2000. It scared me a little bit when I first saw it, and as I grew up, Itâs not that much scary to me at all. Shot in 159 days from June to September of 1974 in Marthaâs Vineyard, Massachusetts; the filming of JAWS was a disaster from delayed shooting days, an unfinished script, bad weather, and three nonfunctional mechanic sharks that forced Spielberg to shoot most of the scenes of the shark only hinted at. The great white shark, nicknamed âBruceâ by the production team after Spielberg's lawyer Bruce Raimer, was made by Production Designer Joe Alves and Special Effects artist Bob Mattey. When they were completed, they were shipped to the shooting location, but unfortunately they had not been tested in water, and when placed in the ocean, the full model sank straight to the ocean floor. When it was released in 464 theaters on June 20th, 1975, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to a total of 675 theaters, the largest simultaneous distribution of a film in motion picture history at the time. During the first weekend of wide release, JAWS grossed more than $7 million, and was the top grosser for the following five weeks. During its run in theaters, the film beat the $89 million domestic rental record of the reigning box-office champion THE EXORCIST, becoming the first film to reach more than $100 million in U.S. box office receipts. Famed Music Composer John Williams, who had previously scored Spielberg's feature film debut THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS and went on to collaborate with him on almost all of his films, contributed the filmâs score that won him the Academy Award for Best Music - Original Score and went on to rank #6 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years of Film Scores. Director Steven Spielbergâs JAWS is an absolute favorite to all movie lovers. See it before you go swimming!",

While the cast, writing, story, and direction is great; the best part of the film is the problem the crew had with the shark.  This problem led them to using less of the shark, and unknowingly formulate one of the greatest decision in cinema.  The lack of seeing the shark adds an incredible amount of depth, suspense, and terror; that it makes  the film better.  Jaws is a gem of cinema that will make you reconsider a trip to the beach anytime soon.",

            "content": "Sometimes things do not go as plans and turn out better than you ever could have hoped. Stephen Spielberg wanted to make a movie about a killer shark but it turned out to be one of the scariest movies of its generation. I'm talking, of course, about Jaws. This thriller has a very simple premise but turned out to be one of the best movies ever made. Filmed on Martha's Vineyard, this film was a pain to shoot, but the reward was well worth it.\nJaws had a really strong cast with Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider, and Richard Dreyfuss. Chief Brody struggles to convince his summer town that there is a killer shark in their waters. The big problem is that it is 4th of July weekend and they need this weekend because tourists bring in all the money the town needs to survive. If word gets out of a killer shark that means no money which means no survival. Murray Hamilton plays the foolish mayor who won't listen to reason. The shark kills a few people and push comes to shove. Brody brings in Matt Hooper, a shark expert, and they figure out the shark is a great white. This thing is a cold blooded eating machine. \"All this fish does is eat, sleep, and make baby sharks, it's that simple.\" Eventually, the town hires Quint, a local fisherman and Brody, Quint, and Hooper venture out to kill the shark. That is our story and it really is done so well.\nJaws is based off a book and they are similar. The basic story is obviously the same, character relationships and development is very similar. The only difference is that Hooper and Brody's wife have an affair. In the movie itself we see them get along and build a relationship and its interesting how Spielberg threw a little tease n there for fans of the book. Also the endings were both different which I also find interesting. The movie ending was way more explosive and enjoyable.\nAs I said this movie was terrifying when it was released in the 70s, but it was scary by accident. The mechanical shark they used was named Bruce, but the thing never worked. To make up for it they only showed parts of the shark. It takes a long time to see what the full shark looks like. Sometimes it's not what you see that is scary, it's what you don't see, and that is what worked so well. We see a girl screaming for her life and getting dragged around, but we don't see what is doing it. It is almost disturbing but it worked and films have copied this tactic time and time again. There were also a lot of problems filming on the open sea. I mention this because any real fan of film would appreciate to know how hard it was to make this movie and how dedicated the filmmakers were to deliver.\nAlong with the scary images of a torn leg, a decaying face, and blood being spit out of a mouth while the jaws of the shark pierce into the abdomen are horrifying, John Williams makes it ten times worse with two notes. Everybody knows the Jaws theme and how it starts out slow and picks up. As it gets faster and faster the shark gets closer and closer, and finally strikes. Music makes the movie, I say it all the time, and John Williams proves it once again, and he did it with two notes.\nTowards the end of the movie all the focus is on Quint, Hooper, Brody, and the shark. Hooper and Quint's relationship is really hysterical. It is old school verses new school. Quint is the rugged fisherman who just makes it up as he goes along. Hooper is the rich college boy with a plan. They butt heads a lot and their sarcastic remarks back and forth are very entertaining.\nMy favorite scene in the entire movie is towards the end when the three men are on the boat telling stories of how they got their scars from sharks or whatever. Then Quint tells a true story of the USS Indianapolis. The USS Indianapolis was a cruiser that sank and all the sailors were in the water and over a few days sharks attacked and killed mostly everyone. Quint was on that ship and he tells the story. Robert Shaw gives one of the best speeches I have ever seen in any movie. The way he tells the story. \"And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes.\" He describes sharks really well and that story was not something I expected form the movie. The true story takes the audience out of the movie and you feel sadness. We dig into Quint's character and even the way the camera just focuses on Quint and how he tells the story. This is a scene I watch twice every time because I love the way he delivers the speech. The only problem I have with the movie itself is that there are two scenes that scare the daylights out of me and I still can't what, and it is impossible to understand what Quint is saying without subtitles.\nOverall, Jaws is a classic and I love the way it was made, the people in it, and the movie itself. The movie works and it is nearly flawless. Jaws is a movie everybody alive in this world needs to see at least once. I bought this on blu ray and it was the best up converted movie I have seen so far. The picture was perfect and the sound was amazing. Sometimes I find myself constantly changing the volume of my surround sound but not with Jaws. Jaws easily gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.",

Many movies with the same idea followed it in the future but none were even able to be compared to this film. The three main characters in the film are so different from each other, of which my favourite is that of Quint because even he has a lot of negativity in this monster flick. Jaws is not among my favourite films because horror is a genre that I favor least because I am never actually scared by anything that comes on the screen. When it comes to the horror type of films, my favourite is The Mist(2007) [It is also a monster flick] and the second is 'Hills Have Eyes'.

Even the scenes like the one with the guys on the boat drinking, telling war stories and singing is incredibly memorable. The way characters picked off one by one almost makes it the world's most sophisticated slasher film, but it's better than that in a way that can only be explained by seeing it.

Spielberg may not have meant to make this film so suspenseful, by not showing the audience the shark until midway through, but it works perfectly for this film. John William's score does an excellent job of adding to that suspense or maybe the score makes the suspense whatever the case it works perfectly. The greatest feature of this film is the great acting and chemistry between the leads, Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper), Roy Schneider (Chief Brody), and Robert Shaw (Quint). The constant bickering between them when they are cooped up on that boat together is great. The shark scenes are certainly great, but the complementary of this great cast is the factor that makes this film so excellent.",

The movie that kept millions of people from going in the Ocean in the 70s, Jaws tells of a shark terrorizing a tourist trap off the coast of Massachusetts. The policeman (Roy Scheider) must team up with a marine scientist (Richard Dreyfuss), and a hunter (Robert Shaw) to bring down the monster. Together they embark to try to hunt down and kill this menace of the deep. Little do they know how dangerous this creature is. When they finally meet they are in for a few unpleasant surprises.

In the book I thought that the stuff with the town was a lot more interesting, because they gave more detail about their lives, and describe all of the effects closing the beach would have on the town. However I thought that the part in the book with Brody's wife was annoying, and I disliked her and Hooper in the book. I am glad they cut that part out of the movie so the film would be more focused on the shark, and the main characters trying to deal with it. In the book Hooper is more interested in studying the shark, and he doesn't appreciate the danger of it at all. He is an ignorant guy who you really dislike in the book, but they made him much more likeable in the film and I was glad to see that he survived at the end of the film. In the book Quint is exactly the same as he is in the movie, so Robert Shaw gets major props for his performance. The movie has elements that are better then the book, and the book has elements that are better then the movie.\n\nThe book has a lot more drama in it. The movie to me was much more suspenseful then the book. The book had a lot more personal drama, and would go a while without hearing about the shark. The book had the drama with Brody's wife, the mayor, and all of the things going through Brody's head. The movie was more suspenseful, because they don't show the shark, or tell you what kind of shark it is until about an hour into the movie. They also do things like making you wonder what is going to happen, and when. The book did have a lot of suspense, but the movie was slower so it could build suspense. Overall they are both equal.\n\nI liked the fact that the shark's movements look mechanical. The reason why is because they really tried to make the shark seem like it was just some kind of machine, and the fact that it looks mechanical when it moves makes it look like a machine too. The shark in Jaws is practically a different breed of Great White sharks. They really do a good job making it seem that way. However there are times when it looks fake, because of the way it's body looks. Because of the technology back then, they couldn't give the shark the body flex that most Great Whites have. When it turns it head left and right it looks like it is being moved by somebody else, because it is mechanical. Also if you pay close enough attention at first it had a light blue on the top half of it's body, but on the 2nd day out there it looked more like it was more black. But other then the few times when it looks like it is clearly a mechanical shark, the use of the mechanical shark. \n\nAn interesting fact is that they named the mechanical shark Bruce on set. Also at first they were supposed to show Bruce in every scene of the movie just like in the book. But nobody had ever used a mechanical shark before, and they were trying to get Bruce to work. Bu they couldn't get Bruce to work in time to start filming so they had to come up with a way to make the movie work without showing the shark until they got it to work. It worked out for the best, and the film is so great because they waited to show the shark. I think that is an example of everything happens for a reason.\n\nEverybody knows the famous line \"Your gonna' need a bigger boat.\" That is an awesome scene because you had been waitng for Jaws to make an appearance, and you can tell they had been out there all day, and then suddenly bam Jaws is there. It is a really well acted scene too. When they watch the shark swim past the boat, and you see how long it is. So amazing. The best scene is when Quint tells the story of when he was on the U.S. Indianapolis. It is such a cool scene, and Robert Shaw's acting was so good in that scene. If you look closely when Brody is out on the bow he grabs a gun, and you see a shooting star go by in the sky. I am sure they did that on purpose to show, that he wishes the shark was dead already.\n\nThis film has a lot of surprising things that happen that make you jump when you see them, because they are unexpected. You jump at the scene when Hooper finds the tooth in the boat. I won't spoil the thing that makes you jump for people who haven't seen this yet, but it freaked me out when I first saw it. There are several times when they show the shark and it makes you jump. Though this is not a scary film, it does make you jump at random times. Some people may find this scary, but I didn't.\n\nThe scene when they first show the shark is one of my all time favorite movie scenes. First the kids swim in the water with a cardboard fin as a practical joke, but when they finally get busted, a girl on the other side of the island see's the real thing. It goes into the pond where Brody's son is, and eats another man. First you just see the sharks fin, but after it knocks the mans boat upside down, you see it's head moving towards the man with it's mouth open, and he gets pulled under water. It's awesome because of how cool the way they show the sharks head for the first time. If you have seen the movie, you will know what I am talking about. That is the thing Spielberg is the master of different camera angles. He uses the angles to show things in such an interesting way that you always can tell it's his work when you see it. He and Alfred Hitchcock are the masters at camera work.\n\nNot only is this a great man vs. nature story, but also it is a story of conflict, and hard decision making. It is about a man fighting against people to do what is right. Martin Brody knows he must close the beaches, but he is fighting against the mayor to do so. Mayor Vaughn whom you hate, believes only what he wants to believe. He refuses to close the beaches, because that will destroy their summer. Amity Island is a town that makes all of their money during the summer. It would kill the town to close down the beaches. You hate him, because you know people are going to get killed because of him, but at the same time you feel for him, because he is in the worst possible position he could be in. Brody will not get blamed because he wanted to close the beaches so it wouldn't be his fault. That is the big conflict that he faces. The mayor is the antagonist in a certain way. At the end when the mayor learns he was wrong you feel bad for him, because you know how bad he must feel. That is why it has a lot of conflict, and it is about making the hardest decisions. That is why it is so good, because no matter what the mayor does he will get heavily criticized for it.\n\nAnother thing about this film is how Spielberg ties his signature style in to it. Like when the shark dies at the end, you see it sinking, and then you hear the dinosaur growl, while there is very peaceful classical music in the background. He gives of all of these emotions that no other director has ever given me, by doing things like that. My favorite scene may be the scene when Brody is sitting at the table, and his son keeps copying all of his motions. It's such a cute scene, and it is so heart warming that scene. The heart warmth I get from Spielberg films is different as I said earlier from other films, and that is a great example of it. The final scene too, when he learns that Hooper is still alive. It was the same feeling, but different. It was a more calming, and southing feeling that you got after all of the action stopped.\n\nI am sure after reading this really long review you know why now Jaws is my all time favorite movie.",

Maybe if the government sent some dentists under water to fix them big teeth, they wouldn't be as intimidating. Anyway, essentially, one's fear of the ocean is thanks to Bruce the Shark. \n\nJaws is exciting and drips (it's more like a waterfall) with suspense. There's a lot of great comedy in here and suspense to get your adrenaline going for the whole night. \n\nJaws, a film that's great for its amazing score by John Williams; amazing and comedic performances; great iconic lines; superb direction by Steven Spielberg; and the priviledge of being one the greatest summer blockbusters of all time.",

Then you have to actually talk about the story and the characters though. Not one character really stands out of the pack as being particularly memorable for any reason and the story to me felt kind of generic. There are some absolutely fantastic scenes in this movie though, like near the end when the man is in the cage underwater. That scene could have been ten minutes longer and I wouldn't have minded.

Hell, can you even get in a pool without doing the music when you sneak up on someone?  This is a very iconic movie that's perfect as a good Halloween time flick for a few jumps.  The movie is about a great white shark that terrorizes a small Ocean side town.  Three guys then set out to kill the shark.  Chief Brody(Roy Scheider), Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss), and local fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw) lead the way and are all three fantastic characters lead by great performances.  This is Spielberg first true Blockbuster(and considered Hollywood's first Summer Blockbuster), and really sets the stage for the great work he would continue to make for the next 30+ years.  I recently bought this on Blu Ray as it was completely remastered and restored and had read how this is the absolute best this has ever look.  It looks fantastic and like it was made last week, not 37 years ago.  Holds up amazingly well, and a movie that should be passed on generation to generation.  Can't wait for Grant to be old enough to enjoy this with me and scare him every time we go swimming.",

With remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, franchises, and cinematic universes taking over our local cinemas each mid-year, it's easy to forget that this whole business started with the troubled production of Jaws. Spielberg's coming-out party stands-out 40 years later as a timeless piece of pure capital-F Filmmaking that surpasses most, if not all, that it influenced. With spectacular characters and thrilling scares, it still makes audiences pause before getting in the water.\nThe modern-day leviathan tale of a tourist town dependent on out-of-towners for their economy (sound familiar, Panama City?) terrorized by a giant shark on July 4th is celebrating its 40th year of keeping audiences dry. The zeitgeist moments are wonderful (jumping mechanical sharks, \"you're gonna need a bigger boat\"), but those thrills are matched by the timelessly human characters and dialogue. Spielberg grounds the excitement in enough reality to keep us engaged, specifically in the three men at the center. Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw have incomparable chemistry, playing some of the most endearing individuals in movie history.\nSure, the mechanics of the shark itself are somewhat antiquated but that's to be expected. I can only imagine what we will think of the effects in Jurassic World in 2055. The immutability of the personality in Jaws is what has kept us returning to it decade after decade. This Independence Day, celebrate your national freedom by enjoying one of the greatest popcorn films of all time...just make sure you go to the beach first.",

Talk about captivating, Spielberg was at the top of his game here with this movie that cost $9 million dollars and made over $470 million dollars. It was also responsible for introducing the idea of summer block buster releases as the movie was shown in over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign.\n\nThe movie is based on a novel of the same name by Peter Benchley, but Spielberg focused on the main theme \"the shark\" removing all the other subplots.\nShot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production, mostly due to the mechanical shark's malfunctions, it also overran its budget and ran past its schedule, and some of these reasons are why some believe Spielberg opted out of being involved in Jaws 2.\n\nThe movie plot was thus: During the summer break some teens were having a night party on fictional Atlantic resort Amity Island.\nOne of the girls went skinny dipping while her friends continue to party on the beach. \n\nWhile waiting for a boy to come join her she got pulled under by something that leaves only you the view with the idea that death came.\n\nWhen pieces of her body washed ashore, the Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) feared that it was a shark attack and wanted to close the beach for the town's safety, but Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) disagreed.\n\nHis point being, the town's people survived mainly on tourist trade and the July 4th holiday was also approaching so he refused to close the beach.\n\nHe soon changed his mind after a boy and a man also died due to shark attack. \n\nHe then decided to hire Quint (Robert Shaw), the only local fisherman willing to take on a Great White.\n\nThe movie score is something that will stick with you and it resembled that used by classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. \n\nTo overcome some of the difficulties encountered Spielberg mostly used an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances.\n\nJaws have had three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley.\n\nJaws also won three Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound.  It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost it to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (which starred Jack Nicolson).\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

John Williams composes one of the best pieces of music ever heard on film and whenever it was heard on screen it made the shark scenes more thrilling and tense to watch and it gives you goosebumps. I was never bored during the dialogue scenes because the script was well written and Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss gave great performances. It was interesting to hear their conversations and their stories and you really got to know them right before they face off against the shark. Robert Shaw's introduction in the movie was one of the best scenes and it automatically made him one of the best characters in the movie. I really think that there are no flaws to be found here at all with the film and it was hard to not like it.

I hadn't watched this film since the dawn of cable tv and it felt like I was watching this for the first time.

It is often imitated by other films that hardly capture the lightning in a bottle that it did. The film is a household name, a favorite among all movie buffs. The terrifying opening hooks us instantly, and as it turns out, the problems behind the scenes turned in the best results. Spielberg's decision to keep the shark under wraps makes the attacks all the more suspenseful. The shark itself looks terrific to this day. There is wonderful character development in Martin Brody (played terrifically by Roy Scheider), his family, and the residents of Amity Island. Richard Dreyfuss's Matt Hooper is a funny and sympathetic character, and Robert Shaw's performance as Quint is pitch-perfect. His U.S.S. Indianapolis speech still gives you the shivers. The final act with the showdown between the three men and the 25-foot, 3-ton Great White still packs a major punch. Overall, the film balances perfect tension with intense shocks, and John Williams' score still scares the hell out of you. After almost 40 years, Jaws never ages. It's a timeless classic that continues to give us good reason to stay out of the water.",

            "content": "The problem of the twenty-first century is the problem of visibility. I am, of course, referring to how movie monsters are always front and center these days. No, Iâ(TM)m not the first person to point that out, or even the hundredth, but after watching the new edition of Jaws on Blu-Ray, I feel like this issue needs to be addressed more than ever. When I watched it, I felt personally threatened by the shark, not just empathetically so. Explain to me how that could happen, and then I could turn to something like Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Manâ(TM)s Chest, and feel nothing when the Kraken shows up and demolishes a massive pirate ship?\n\tAfter sitting through the first hour or so of Jaws and finally getting a glimpse of the man-eater, the payoff felt real to me. Steven Spielberg deals little tidbits of the shark to you in the form of either spontaneous violence, or gruesome physical evidence, like the shark tooth thatâ(TM)s the size of a âshot glass.â? Spielberg, even at the age of 29, was a savvy enough director to understand that our imaginations are far more dangerous than reality usually is. So when we see Brody flipping through a detailed, illustrated book about sharksâ\"and then see all the disastrous stuff from the pictures actually happenâ\"weâ(TM)re left feeling just as at sea as Brody, Hooper, and Quint (pun definitely intended).\n\tBut the sharkâ(TM)s low profile is not the only reason why Jaws is so great. Even though it was one of the first summer blockbusters, watching it again makes me realize how slow of a burn it is. Of course, the story is paced masterfully; thatâ(TM)s not the problem. Spielberg opens the movie with the moonlit murder of a teenaged girl, and then the next scene is set in Brodyâ(TM)s tranquil seaside house. The contrast is startling, yet organic and effective. Rather than immediately cutting to Brody inspecting the bloody mess left by the shark on the shore, Spielberg lures us into a false sense of security by easing us up to that point. Itâ(TM)s almost more sadistic for Spielberg to treat his audience this way than if he had showed us explicit close-ups of the girl being torn apart underwater.\n\tAnother reason why Jaws is so revered is because of its focus on character. The story does take itself seriously, and never devolves into straight comedy, but the tone of the movie is far from dark. This is because of the levity brought by Hooper, played by Richard Dreyfuss. Heâ(TM)s a younger man than Brody and Quint; he loves sharks and knows a ton about them, but his enthusiasm about his job is boyishly infectious. Compared to Brody and Quintâ\"both of whom have been at their jobs for quite some time nowâ\"Hooper is a greenhorn. He is not there for comic relief, because, as a shark expert, he serves a key role in the mission. But without him there for Quint to bicker with, weâ(TM)d only be left with the two older men to trade somber stories, such as the bummer tale of the U.S.S. Indianapolis. Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw both turn in excellent performances, but I would argue that Dreyfuss is the superior presence here.\n\tProbably the coolest part about Jaws is that it manages to include all the hallmarks of summer popcorn flicksâ\"boobs, explosions, and violenceâ\"without losing its heart. Spielberg has a more professional and nuanced approach than our current crop of blockbuster directors, and so Jaws satisfies both your superego and your id at the same time. Itâ(TM)s a shame that Spielberg, who is still making movies, is not turning out the same quality work as he used to. For me, man vs. shark will always be more interesting than horse vs. war.",

He fully justified the hopes pinned audiences and critics at his first job in the \"big cinema\" - tape \"Sugarland Express.\" Producers David Brown and Richard D. Zanuck decided to entrust Spielberg more impressive budget (the numbers from seven to twelve million - that is, as of 2008 it could be from twenty-four to forty-odd million dollars).\n\nBut the success of the movie \"Jaws\" has surpassed even the wildest expectations. He was the first summer blockbuster in the history of American film, raking in $ 260 million and failing to attract audience of 126.8 million viewers. And if you count the results, taking into account inflation and changes in ticket prices, then this picture is now in seventh place in all the years of being the highest grossing film work, awe-inspiring. At the same time film \"Jaws\" recognized as a classic film - and the audience (is rated 8.3 points out of ten voting in imdb), and critics: according to a survey of the American Film Institute, conducted in 2007, it was named the 56th in a row among the hundred best cinematographic USA.\n\nOf conventional fiction (American critic Leonard Moltin used the term \"chewing gum\"), from the pen of Peter Benchley, director Steven Spielberg has created truly one of the most intense and frightening film. Exciting atmosphere of action, multiplied by the entertainment with unique special effects, gave impressive results. In this \"blockbuster\" with the multi-million budget (only one stuffed with electronics man-eater cost nearly a million dollars), the director, in fact, repeated construction of much more modest cost \"The Duel\". As if a man were opposed not just an ordinary shark, which was to attack people off the coast of New England, near the island of Martha's Vineyard (incidentally, Benchley novel was based on a real case), and some completely unknown, the strange sight of supernatural power.\n\nAgain, according to Spielberg, this is the most evil or the Rock (call it what you want!) Should win, personally overcome only the individual, one by one, and, as they say, with his bare hands. Also - quite inexperienced hero (not like Quintus, an avowed hunter sharks) and does not have special knowledge, like the scientist ichthyologist Cooper. The local sheriff Brody, by the way, still does not know how to swim (this is anecdotal in common with what the director is also a panic fear of the water, removing the \"Jaws\"), more suited for a quiet family life than going to the sea for sharks, and in general looks like an insecure intellectual. Also helps him to win is not skill, intelligence or knowledge, and human duty. Sheriff wins his own, finding a spiritual strength, hidden reserves to fight with what seems to be indestructible. Not reminiscent of the struggle with the mysterious phenomena in the films of Steven Spielberg fight man almost to himself, his own weakness, hidden evil that still exists somewhere inside him?\n\nDirector film \"Jaws\" ingeniously injects anxiety and fear, using all possible means, from shock, impact and always unexpected impact on the psyche of the public - to create a truly nervous situation perception. This, of course, contribute to: the now classic \"terrible\" music by John Williams (for which he got the \"Oscar,\" \"Golden Globe Awards,\" \"Grammy\" Award and BAFTA), which seems to warn of approaching danger as the corresponding sounds and noises (makers of sound score were also rewarded Academy Award Â (R)); purely directorial findings reinforce oppressive feeling, and setting the right rhythm virtuoso installation Verna Fields (another \"Oscar\"). Then there were three series of man-eater, including - stereovariant, is no match for the power of the original experience, which gave birth to the audience almost mythical, archetypical, nesting deep in the human subconscious animal fear.",

We get to see the terror it brings to humanity, how people react to it and the battle between safety and commerce.  It's in the second half when all pretense of \"art film\" is thrown out the window for an adventure.  Sure, the shark body slamming the rear of the boat to flood it is a bit over the top, as is pretty much everything that comes after this point.  Yet I'm willing to forgive this.  Why?  It looks pretty damn awesome in the end and it provides a complete, unfiltered look at the shark.  After all, two hours into the film and the audience deserves it, right?",

This is one of Steven Spielberg's best work as a filmmaker, ever since, after \"Jaws\". Spielberg did some great movies after this one as well, a few bad ones and some underrated ones.\n\nRoy Scheider (52 Pick Up), Robert Shaw (The Deep) and Richard Dreyfuss (Stakeout) are just terrific in this movie. Leonard Maltin called this movie a rare bubble-gum story that truly works. I argee with that. There is a few obvious technical errors in the movie. The scene towards the end with the mechanical shark mixed with the real one, you can tell the differences.between the fake one and the real one. Also the shark roars in this one! Watching the blu-ray of this movie. I thought \"Jaws the Revenge\"' the shark was roaring. But for this movie does work!!!\n\nJohn Williams` music is excellent and so is the flawless ending. Don't miss one of the best movies ever made, Certainly the best Blockbuster movie known to the critics and audiences. A real true classic from the 1970's.",

I remember the release of Jaws like it was yesterday, the hype that surrounded it was colossal. Jaws as you recall is the movie that started the summer blockbuster!! It is the perfect balance of horror, and action/adventure that make Jaws still today 37 years later still as effective as the day it was released. Spielberg took a bubblegum story (although the book is a good read) by Benchley and turned it into a classic film that many imitate, copy, steal or just try to capture the essence but ultimately fail every time. The keys to Jaws sucess where three: 1 John Williams score, 2 Verna Bloom's editing, and 3 the minimalistic use of Bruce (the shark) due to performance problems. Without these factors Speilberg couldn't have made such a great movie. As for the Blu-ray release well tomorrow we will find out much better a great movie can be!       \n\nUpdate 8/20: I purchased Jaws on Blu-ray on 8/14 and watched it the next day, and I am pleased to say that it was a spectacular transfer well worth the wait! The picture was crystal clear and the sound was near perfect. With over 3 hours of extra features this version of Jaws should satisfy almost all fans, the original documentary has an extra hour added to it as well as a brand new doc. My only gripe is not with Jaws at all but with Best Buy! Jaws is a classic film, one of the best but Best Buy stocked so few copies. I know that 1975 was quite a long time ago but Jaws is miles above a lot of the dreck they make today (think Battleship, John Carter, Jack and Jill the list could go on and on) and yet hundreds of these fill the shelves. I shudder to think of how the big box stores are going to treat the Indy series come November. But anyways Jaws is a spectacular transfer to Blu-ray, and again the wait was well worth it!!",

Jaws is not only the best shark movie out their but its also proof that Spielberg films out their. Jaws is about a giant shark that arrives on the shores of a New England beach resort and terrorizes the swimmers, until a local sheriff teams up with a marine biologist, and an old seafarer to hunt the shark down. Steven Spielberg is by far one the best directors out their and whats so impressive about Jaws is that Spielberg is famous for directing epic biographies, dramas, mysteries and even sometimes action movies but Jaws is different because its a thriller, which is totally unlike Spielberg however he pulled it off great, this is definitely one of Spielberg's best films. The best part about Jaws is the characters who are portrayed excellently by Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfus, and Robert Shaw these three actors not only do a great job playing these characters but have some of the best on screen chemistry of any trio in Hollywood. Another great aspect of Jaws is the films intensity, do not let the PG rating fool you this is one of the most intense films I have seen, its even more intense then some PG-13 or even R rated movies out their, not to mention it even convinced an entire generation of people not to swim in the ocean. At this point I would point out the flaws in a film but I can't find any with this film, its pretty much a perfect film. Jaws is a classic film that has everything a sharp script, an intense storyline, and a great characters brought to us by an amazing cast, if you need a classic to get you in the Shark Week spirit go watch Jaws you won't be disappointed.",

The huge and bloodthirsty sharks are remarkably detailed and realistic, all of the characters that take part in this gore-fest act surprisingly believably and the viewer can feel their pain and suffering in every scene. It's a blockbuster for the ages, one that started the whole race for the best summer movie of the season. Undeniably effective, fast-paced, scary, and the climatic, creepy music composed by John Williams that gives the creeps and prepares the audience for the inevitable worst. And it's influence will always be present, no matter how many years will past.",

            "content": "Before the wacky \"1941\", the delightful family classic \"E.T.\" and the thrilling adventures within the \"Indiana Jones\" series, Steven Spielberg made his big break with this classic blockbuster about a big shark going around and slaughtering people in gruesome ways. Wow, back in the '70s, before PG-13, they really were stuck with G, PG and, um, some other rating, I don't quite kno-oh yeah, R! Eh, considering how they've still got stuff like the topless scene in \"Titanic\", all of the head severing in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Michael Bay trying to push the PG-13 envelope as much as he can with violence (I have never seen someone's head ripped apart with axes in an R film, but considering that it happened to a robot in \"Revenge of the Fallen\", I suppose it's alright for kids), toning down the rating on blockbusters for a bigger audience is a pastime as old as blockbuster filmmaking itself, though you would think that, by this time, they would realize that it doesn't matter what you rate a film, because people are gonna bring their stupid kids anyways. Around the time the dumb 20-somethings started bringing their screaming rugrats in to watch \"Saw\" with them, I just had to say forget the censors (Anyone else noticing the mild hypocricy in my saying, \"forget\"?). Actually, a statement like that probably should have been dropped around the time they stamped PG on this film, because if Steven Spielberg is known for nothing else outside of the cheesiness and a diverse filmography... and producing everything... and having a lot of money... and six kids, then he's known for getting pretty hardcore with the gore, or rather, hardgore. Well, at least he knows how to compensate for all of the violence by building good films around it, and if nothing else proves that, then it's, well, \"Saving Private Ryan\", which is violent to the point of being ignorantly offensive, but shoot, it is an awesome film. Outside of that, other testaments to Spielberg's making enjoyable films regardless of extreme violence include \"Munich\", \"War of the Worlds\"... \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" based on the face melting, \"The Temple of Doom\" based on the heart removing, \"Amistad\" based on the horribly bloody massacre of an entire ship crew (Jeez, what is wrong with Steven Spielberg?) and, of course, this film. Still, as good as this film is, too much violence for a PG rating is the least of its problems.\r\n\r\nWe're going back to the good old days, back when certain throwaway thriller character types were still fresh, and that's good and all, but really, the problem with the stock characters found in this film nowadays isn't just that they've become bad cliches, but that they really just don't have a whole lot of depth or considerable believability, and evidently haven't since their debut. Now, some of our leads get his or her fair share of exposition, and certain supporting players feel more fleshed out than others, though Steven Spielberg has never been especially notorious for subtley, and while many of these characters aren't walking around wearing a big sign that says, \"Shark Bait - Literally Half-Off!\", many crucial component characters to the story, whether they be supporting players or even a few leads, don't feel terribly fleshed out, or even of that much interest to Spielberg and, by extension, the audience, thus rendering quite a few characters to fall flat as rather artificial, especially when we're facing such exaggerated characters as the dirtbag mayor who doesn't want it getting out that the beach is shark infested so that he can get plenty of attendance for the Fourth of July. Now, I understand that this film is more about the thrill of the kill, so I'm not asking for extensive backstory or thorough subplots, but the limiting of humanity within the film dilutes substance, and with there not being a shark attack every scene, you're going to need that extra compellingness, especially when you consider that this film seriously needs that livening up at points. I know that it's hard to hear that this film gets slow, but buddy, when there's not shark going around slaughtering people, the film loses momentum awful quick, rarely, if ever to the point of becoming dull, but decidedly to the point of becoming too steady for its own good. At over two hours, this project is a bit longer than quite a few of the films it inspired, as well as a bit longer than it should be, and when this film hits a slow-down point, it really does slow things down, with storytelling that drags along limply and just doesn't \"bite\" too deeply or even hold that much \"water\" (Okay, I'll stop), and with the film's substance going diluted by the aforementioned improvable characterization, the film simply becomes disengaging when there are no terribly tense moments, which, even then, have their effectiveness tainted by the film's flawed storytelling. Okay, now, the film's substance value isn't quite a significant as I'm making it sound, but really, a film like this relies on its substance more than you would expect it to, as it supplements the tension, and with this film being too slow for its own good when there's no ruthless killing of completely uninteresting and rather inhuman characters, what we're ultimately left with are the makings of a bloodless bloodbath of an underwhelming thriller, like the ones we have plenty of today. This film, however, is above that, not so much because it was just so inventive for its time or because its time was long ago enough for annoying critical nostalgia to set it, but because what this film does do right sets a standard, even, to a degree, for stylish thrillers.\r\n\r\nNow, Bill Butler's cinematography isn't especially sensational, even for the '70s, though it is consistently handsome, with occasions that really are pretty striking, yet no matter what, the photography is cleverly manipulated to emphasize the claustrophobia of the film, being used to play with scope in a fashion that's tensely intimate, and even a touch grand at points. These somewhat sweeping, yet still pretty airtight shots stimulate sharply, stylishly amplifying the effectiveness of the film, though, as any self-respecting film or music respecter will tell you, it's the audible stimulants that really spark things up. Make no mistake, John Williams' score truly is brilliant, being pretty distinctly John Williams, but still extremely unique by its own, playing with such somber composition points as those certain infamous two notes to create a unique style that's both a joy and terror to listen to, as it breathes subtle potency on its own, let alone in the context of the film, and as Williams brings in the bigger and broader notes to give the film both grand sweep and broad intensity, it's hard not find yourself pulled to the edge of your seat, excited by both the phenomenal score and the piercing tone the score supplements, especially considering how not-too-shabby the sound design is. Typically, tone has to be initially established before it can be supplemented, but really, the tension supplements to this film are so razor-sharp that they alone could establish the tension, which of course makes the tension as it is all the more potent, because Spielberg already firmly establishes the tone of the film with a powerful manipulation of atmosphere, whose effectiveness may go hurt by the missteps in substance handling, but is still handled by Spielberg competently enough to draw about as much blood as the shark he's making so scary. Still, as much as I complain about this film's substance being messily handled, this film's story is fairly strong, and while many characters don't really resonate, the characters that do resonate are undeniably pretty colorful and memorable, whether it be Richard Dreyfuss' charming oceanographer Matt Hooper character or Roy Scheider's struggling leading Martin Brody character. Characters such as these are well-concieved and even pretty well-portrayed, and when Spielberg actually takes the time to flesh them out, the more artificial-feeling character types are all but \"drowned out\" (See what I did there?) and the story shines especially bright, and as I said, it's already a pretty well-concieved and well-manipulated. Now, the film doesn't \"strike\" (Okay, that was a bit of a stretch) with as much intrigue as it should, being that the story and potential for compelling substance are stronger than you might think, yet at the end of the film, the film remains intriguing, as well as stylish, competently acted, competently directed and altoghter pretty thrilling at points, and after a while, the final product \"sinks its teeth into you\" and leaves you to find difficulty in breaking loose, for although this film doesn't \"bite\" me as firmly as it has many others, you'd be hard pressed to not find yourself thrilled by this classic piece of blockbuster effectiveness with a hint of compelling substance.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film takes its share of wounds from faulty substance - mostly spawned from sometimes uninspired characterization - and the breaking up of the shark attack sequences with large chunks of consistent slowness that may not render the film all that dull, but definately leaves things to slow down to the point of rendering the film somewhat disengaging, though not at all underwhelming, as the film catches your eyes with Bill Butler's fine photography and your ears with fine sound design and John Williams' outstanding score work, while Steven Spielberg draws constant tension during the action sequences through his firm grip on atmosphere, as well as investment through his flawed but generally strong control of substance - made all the stronger by some good performances and some characters that are, in fact, colorful and memorable -, thus leaving \"Jaws\" to bite as a compelling, tense and generally rewarding blockbuster classic and breakout for the father of the blockbuster.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

In those films, the killer is human, whereas here; it is not. The body belongs to a girl who went swimming in the ocean the night before and never came back. We saw something attack her off-camera from the blue abyss. Her body is found mutilated beyond comprehension; her limbs separated from her torso. This is clearly not the work of a boat collision. No, the only thing that could do this in these areas is a shark. In the perimeter of the island, they are rarely ever seen, but the locals know they're there. But these are people with the mentality of us all; if something is not frequently threatening, then we shan't let it spoil our fun. This is their twisted philosophy on the matter.\r\n\r\nChief-of-Police Martin Brody (Roy Schneider) wants the beaches to be closed down until they can successfully capture the shark. He's called in a marine biologist who specializes in these animals to assist. But the 4th of July is only a few days away, and this is a profitable time for the island as it means hundreds-to-thousands of beach bums will be roaring into its gates hoping for a nice weekend by the sea; which is why the Mayor insists that the beaches remain open and available to the public. But then, disaster strikes. The famous scene at the beach in which the shark takes the life of a middle-aged woman's little boy. Her hysteria puts the islanders in a state of wide-spread panic; and soon, large groups of fisherman are boarding their boats to set out and try to bring back the dead corpse of the shark that killed the child. It is at this moment that the marine biologist - Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) - arrives.\r\n\r\nWithin the second act, the boats return and the men believe they've found, captured, and killed the shark responsible for the kid's death. Hooper examines it further and requests that he be able to gut it so that he may see what's currently in its digestive track. The size of the captured shark's mouth did not match that of the bite-marks on the dead girl's corpse - or at least what remained of it. And sure enough; they got the wrong one. It's time for Brody to take the initiative; he assembles a crew - him, Hooper, and the fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) - and sets sail for the very ocean which the shark freely roams. With them they bring explosives, harpoons, guns, and barrels attached to the combination of the last two so that they may track the shark if the harpoon successfully makes contact with its flesh. And there goes the third act.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly one of the best thrillers there is. The plot is set-up simplistically enough, but the set-up itself works well for the film; the complexions are hidden beneath, and they beckon any viewer who truly loves the film to keep revisiting it again and again. But each act is executed with such utter finesse that you soon stop caring about \"simplicity\" or even \"predictability\". Even the great films have their flaws - hell, EVERY film does - but when it comes to the major and logical complaints, there aren't too many to be made in regards to \"Jaws\". Spielberg proves that he is a fierce and relentless filmmaker; not only gifted with a distinctive style, but also with the ability to stage gut-wrenching tension. I don't suppose this film will ever age as so many of its predecessors - good, bad, or just plain ugly - have. That's why it's so great to wear the title of a true original. Nobody had yet considered staying out of the water before it. But the impact has left its mark on our society and has even inspired other shark movies to reassure us that it's not always safe to take a dip. To say the least, it's made us fear the black-ish jagged fin more than anything else out there.\r\n\r\nThis film's shark is old-school animatronic. Upon revisiting \"Jaws\", I can now safely rest on the opinion that animatronic sharks will almost always be more genuinely scary than the fancy CGI ones that we see so much of today. Perhaps the only thing more frightening is a real shark, and oh, that's just too risky by the standards of most modern filmmakers. Spielberg used to make movies into magic; with effects that were - for the time - state of the art, he would draw you in to what I like to call the cinematic experience. \"Jaws\" is a killer shark movie written in gore, POV shots from the perspective of the swimming shark, and a suspenseful musical score by John Williams that anticipates the approaching animal as it comes full-speed ahead. The whole thing whizzes by very fast indeed. It's an experience, a stimulating one, and no other killer shark movie can even hope to compare (but of course, a few have tried).\r\n\r\nIt's debatable whether this is a horror film or a thriller, although I like to consider it the latter. I don't know why. The difference often times feels nigh indistinguishable. The emotions that the film elicits are no different from that of most horror films (or at least the good ones), yet it's based on mood and tension rather than blood and gore (although it still delivers in such departments). Then again, so are the best of horror films. It's not worth arguing about. \"Jaws\" is quite possibly one of my favorite thrillers because it doesn't sacrifice intelligence or its characters for the scares. It still holds up real well today, and is almost certain to fry your nerves. It's 2012, and when the film first made its debut it was 1975; yet we're still gonna need a bigger boat.",

The shark itself looks very real and was ferocious, and while its scary, its absences are the scariest moments, we are taunt to imagine where it'll attack next. The casts (Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody, Robert Shaw as Quint, and Richard Dreyfuss as Hooper) are awesome, three people that are too different teamed up to hunt down this perfect killing machine. Brody's lack of experience, Quint's haughtiness and haunting past as well as Hooper eagerness and pride is the major drive in this movie.

In fact, he came up with the acknowledged best horror film of all-time. \r\n\r\nPLOT:It's summer on Amity Island and everyone's getting ready to have beach parties by the water. That is, until talk of a huge shark killing people starts buzzing around. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) starts getting nervous and protective about the citizens and tourists of Amity Island, so he calls up oceanologist, Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), to help gather information and convince the mayor to close the beaches and send someone out to kill the shark. The mayor says no, until another fatal attack occurs. The mayor succumbs and hires expert shark-hunter, Captain Quint (Robert Shaw), who goes for a high price. Now the chief, oceanologist, and Quint must go out on the ocean and catch the beast. It's a good plot idea executed brilliantly. \r\n\r\nACTING:The performances in here are all great and memorable. The three main characters definitely clicked somehow and stole the show. The shiners, including the three main characters, were Roy Sheider as Chief Brody, Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper, Robert Shaw as Quint, Murray Hamilton as Mayor Larry Vaughn, Susan Backlinie as Chrissie Watkins, and Lee Fierro as Mrs. Kintner. Each played a truly memorable part. \r\n\r\nSCORE:The score is brilliantly done by the great John Willams. The score is not only memorable, but iconic, as everyone remembers the Jaws theme. \r\n\r\nEFFECTS:The effects of the blood, remains, and the shark itself are still today haunting and as scary as they were. They also looked more real than any blood effects you might find today. If you didn't know, they used a mix of stock footage and a mechanical shark to make \"Jaws\" real. The result (though in behind-the-scens interviews, they say the shark was malfunctioning) was a violent, scary, and harrowing trip into the water and back out. \r\n\r\nCAMERAWORK:The camerawork in here was actually pretty good. Spielberg caught some amazingly creepy and artsy shots. I didn't think Spielberg was that much of a camera expert. \r\n\r\nOTHER CONTENT:This film is iconic to everyone who has seen it. No one can forget such a memorable film. If you ask someone, \"What's the movie with the shark?\", they'll most likely say \"Jaws\". Everything is memorable in here, from lines, to characters, to certain scenes, and to even the music! More importantly, today this is still extremely scary and can make more than one person scared to get in the water, and can fill just about anyone with undeniable terror. Even more importantly than that, it's so scary because it's real. This monster isn't a regular Frankenstein or zombie, it's a real-life, natural animal. The same goes for the characters. Everything in here could very well be true. That's what makes it so good. Spielberg's sense of perfection came out in a different form, but it was definitely there. \r\n\r\nOVERALL,an epic horror film with a brilliantly executed plot, great acting, iconic score, haunting effects, good camerawork, extreme terror, real events, and everything about this film becoming memorable.",

            "content": "Like an old friend visiting town, \"Jaws\" is back on the big screen. It's a newly restored print and Spielberg's classic has never looked or sounded better. \r\nWhen I hear the phrase \"movie magic\" I don't think of Michael Bay leaning over the shoulder of some computer whiz as he adds more pixels to a CG robot. I think of the sort of photos you see in any documentary about the filming of this movie, or those found in the pages of Carl Gottlieb's excellent account \"The Jaws Log\". Pictures of disgruntled fx men standing around a motionless rubber shark, scratching their heads, \"how the hell do we make this work?\". Make it work they did, thanks mainly to the improvisational genius of Spielberg. Knowing the shark, which came to be known as \"Bruce\", wouldn't always be available when needed, Spielberg had to come up with other ways to represent it's threat. Witness the scene involving two night fishermen who are menaced by the shark despite it never being visible. A broken piece of pier changing course in the water is all that's needed to terrify the audience. We know what that floating wood represents, there's no need to see a mouthful of teeth. Likewise the yellow barrels harpooned to the shark. Their change of speed and direction tell us everything we need to know. Had the shark actually worked every time it was originally thought necessary this would no doubt be a far less effective movie.\r\nThat the film would even be completed was often called into question. The studio execs were constantly on the young directors back, too many captains on the island. They constantly questioned his film-making decisions but thankfully Spielberg stuck to his guns. As a result the movie is packed from start to finish with some of cinema's greatest moments; Scheider's son mimicking his father at the dinner table, Ben Gardner's half-chewed head popping out of a damaged boat's hull, the shark rising out of the water as Scheider chums the water and the one-shot barge ride to mention but a few. Some of it's dialogue has become legendary, lines like \"We're gonna need a bigger boat\" and \"Smile you son of a...\",  along with Shaw's fantastic monologue recounting the USS Indianapolis sinking. I doubt there's any book of scenes for actors which doesn't feature the one penned by John Milius and delivered incredibly by Shaw.\r\nThe one part of \"Jaws\" that's become burned into our pop culture psyche is undoubtedly John Williams' fantastic score, recognised by even those few poor souls who have never seen this great movie. Williams is regularly criticised, often rightly, for his tendency to over-indulge himself, filling every scene with bombastic music. Here he gets it just right, a large portion of the  movie unaccompanied by score. When that staccato rhythm appears it does so at just the right moments. One of the most interesting parts of the score is that of the scenes where the three protagonists give chase to the shark. Williams gives us a joyful rather than ominous motif, reflecting the new found thrill Scheider's character has discovered. This is after all, like Spielberg's \"Duel\" and \"Close Encounters\" predominantly a movie about a man's escape from his mid-life crisis.\r\nIt might be the greatest adventure ever filmed but it's also a film rich with metaphor. If you like to find hidden meanings you could consider this the middle act in Spielberg's Jewish trilogy, sandwiched between \"Duel\" where Dennis Weaver finds himself out of place in a world of gruff Gentile truckers, and \"Close Encounters\" where Dreyfuss returns to a homeland he's never been to yet feels a kinship with, an outer space Zion. Here Scheider and Dreyfuss are two Jews on an island of Gentiles, desperate to alert them to a threat which is only dealt with after the unthinkable has happened. The entire movie could also be read as a WWII analogy. Scheider is America, reluctant to take action until Pearl Harbour (Amity Island) suffers a brutal attack and the threat is made explicit by it's European allies (Dreyfuss), and forced to form an uneasy alliance with Russia, represented by Shaw, the angry bear who makes the biggest sacrifice of all. This is never made more explicit than the scene in which the three compare scars, Dreyfuss' mainly the result of vanity and a spirit of conquest while Shaw's are the wounds of a proletariat struggle for survival. Scheider only has an appendectomy scar which he chooses not to reveal; his wounds will come later.\r\nComing to Blu-Ray on August, you may be tempted to sit this one out but you're doing yourself a disservice, you'll never see \"Jaws\" look this good. If you see one blockbuster this summer make it this one. A great script, quality actors, a director at the top of his game and a rubber monster; this is cinema.",

I probably know this film to well - the dialogue, musical cues, minor faults and all.\nJaws was the first ever 'Summer Event' movie, way back in 1975, and was the mainstream introduction of a Mr Steven Spielberg to the world (barring Duel, and Sugarland express). Speilberg directs perfectly, creating many memorable scenes (Indianapolis speech, the horrifying shark attacks and that beautiful reverse tracking shot of Brody on the beach are the true stand outs). The three main cast members (Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss) are out of this world, and the story that was based on Peter Benchley's novel is taunt from the off, and thankfully trimmed of the novel's sometimes soapy themes.\nOK. The shark. Bruce was not an out and out success. But that is what completely makes the film. Speilberg had no choice but to use the model shark sparingly, and this works wonderfully to the films advantage, keeping the menace off camera for as long as possible.....using POV shots of people swimming......and utilising John Williams famous and fantastic score to great effect. The shark may only have five or ten minutes of screen time, but it's presence is felt throughout the whole of the film.\nJaws had a profound effect on me, and I believe it is a benchmark in cinema history that will never be bettered.",

Nowadays, the term blockbuster is associated with poor-quality mass-produced movies churned out just or the sake of profit. However, Jaws set this standard because it was an outlier for its time: an extremely successful movie that was still of extraordinary quality. Jaws set the bar for all other big-studio movie-makers, and who can blame them? It has some of the most ground-breaking special effects of the 1970s which made the gargantuan namesake shark all the more terrifying. It contains some very naturalistic elements as well, almost a sort of modern Moby Dick. Man v. the unstoppable, brutal, and (most frighteningly) apathetic force of nature manifested in the form of a Great White Shark. This eating machine is hear all to the ignorance of the beach-goers and the penny-pinching beach-owner at the beginning of the movie. When the idea of this movie and/or the book on which it was based was first pitched to a studio or publisher, they must have seen it as a farce. After all, what are the chances of seeing a Great White shark off the coast of New England? It's the sheer foreignness of that idea that makes Jaws all the more terrifying: quaint, naive tourists in their comfort zone on the beach of Amity Island; worst case scenario: a great white shark appears. Which is precisely what happens. Just the idea of something so ridiculous actually happening is what plunges the beach into a state of such utter chaos. It is a suspenseful thrill ride unlike anything you have ever watched. A classic, indeed it is.",

The next day, Chief Police Martin Brody suspects that there is something attacking the tourists when something does attack the tourists that day as the multimillion-year old shark returns to the sea to dine on the tourists. The Mayor orders the local fishermen to catch the long-living fish species but greedy to reopen the beach despite the warning from ichthyologist Matt Hooper. Martin and Hooper team up with an old local fisherman named Quint who is willing to take on the shark. The three set out on Quint's boat named \"The Orca\" ready to face their swimming predator of the sea. Jaws was the first film that the set the genre of fearing the open water and because of this, I'll never go swimming in the open water ever again. This is the 10th best horror movie I have ever seen in my life and everyone should understand why. I wish Steven Spielberg actually took a look back on his earlier days and really would understand how great he was. Jaws gets a solid 10/10.",

Who would have thought that a typical monster masher movie would be this entertaining? The reason is that Jaws spawned all of those horrible attempts to recreate it. There are thousands (Lake Placid, Anaconda, Deep Blue Sea etc.) but none can match up to how dynamic Jaws is.\nThe best actor award goes to Richard Dreyfuss. Once again, his performance is amazing and resonating.  \nMy one complaint is that the film becomes horribly monotonous once we witness 15 minutes of three yellow barrels zooming across the water surface. \nThere is the occasional disappointment of looking at a creature that resembles a obese shark (because of the recent popularity in CGI), but the fact that Winston could create such a creature is amazing. He truly was a legend in the industry.\nYes, this film changed the industry. Yes, this film did lead to a shocking decline in the global shark population (is this really a positive thing?).\nBut, I cannot justify EMPIRE making this their 5th best film. No ways.",

The film's real achievement is how it makes us truly feel the water is a dangerous place; we experience trepidation when characters approach the sea and a sense of being trapped when they return to the island. It's Spielberg's ability to conjure these emotions in us that makes Jaws rise above its B movie trappings to become an object of supreme terror and supreme entertainment, in equal measure.",

            "content": "Making a movie monster that is genuinely, viscerally scary is not easy. Making it scary in broad daylight, when artificiality cannot be hidden away in shadow, is even harder. Hardest of all is creating movie characters that archetypal enough to become iconic yet human enough to connect with each other and with the audience on more than a surface level. \"Jaws\" makes all of these things look ridiculously easy. It's such an engrossing, enjoyable (even when startling) experience that its quality is something you feel on an instinctive, subconscious level rather than something you can think about and convince yourself of. Only during an umpteenth watching might you be able to pry yourself out of the moment long enough to consider why it works so well. I think the crucial ingredient in the alchemy, more than the life-like and glassy-eyed shark robots that famously never worked during shooting, more than the heart-pounding zoom on the beach as Chief Brody realizes that the shark and his child are both in the pond, more than the brilliant and artful editing in the next scene as he runs faster and faster through the crowd of beachgoers while the camera jumps closer and closer to him, and even more than the John Williams score that is surely the most imitated among his oeuvre of unlikely hits... more than these, I think it is the characters and the casting that seal \"Jaws\"'s place as one of the best movies of all time.\n\nRoy Scheider is Chief Brody, a serious cop type with the rather obvious quirk of hating the water, but he plays the role with a method-esque realism that allows us to imagine ourselves in his shoes. Scheider plays Brody on the edge, well shy of neurotic but definitely bottling a lot in, and it doesn't take much to tip him over into anger, fear or, finally, joy. He's up against two much less method-y, much less bottled-up actors and characters: Richard Dreyfuss's nerdy, cocky scientist and Robert Shaw's... well, adjectives fall short of what Shaw creates for Quint, the captain of the Orca. Quint is the broadest, most familiar archetype in the film, a salty sea dog who reckons experience over book-learning, but Shaw fills the character to overflowing with history and personality. His monologue about the real-life 1945 sinking of the USS Indianapolis, filmed in a long unbroken take that feels eerily still and breathless, is the highlight of the movie. Slow, quiet monologues are NEVER the highlights of thrillers, horrors, and summer popcorn fare. But \"Jaws\" is unique. These three characters bounce off each other and at any moment can and do explode into conflict, but they also have enough depth that each one can lock in with the others in interesting and unexpected ways. Sometimes it's Scheider and Dreyfuss's grounded characters against the unstable Quint. At other times it's the landlubbing Brody who's out of the loop while the two experts trade fish tales. We probably wouldn't want to join them on the boat, but they're always great fun to watch on screen. Spielberg's cameras are arranged so that three men can almost always fit in the same frame at the same time.\n\nIt's impossible to imagine \"Jaws\" without its supporting cast, too, especially Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody and Murray Hamilton as Mayor Larry Vaughn, but it's the three principles who are indispensable and irreplaceable. Their absence is a big reason why none of the three Jaws sequels work or really even count. If \"Jaws 2\" is tolerable, it is only the presence of Scheider that makes it so. On the other hand, even a reunion of all three main characters from the first movie couldn't have saved the stupefyingly stupid script of \"Jaws 4: The Revenge\" of \"This Time It's Personal\" infamy. Perhaps it is the highest testament to the quality of \"Jaws\" that people went to see those later movies, in the ever-vanishing hopes that they would recapture even a glimmer of the glory of the original.",

            "content": "Jaws, in many ways, is the original source responsible for the film industry as we have known it for the past three-and-a-half decades: the era of the big-budget, widely released, high concept summer blockbuster. It is also the breakout film of Steven Spielberg, the man responsible for many of the aforementioned summer hits over the past 35 years. So, as the film that \"started it all\", so to speak, how does Jaws hold up on its own after decades of wear-and-tear and scores of wannabe imitators and sequels? The answer, quite simply, is near-perfectly. Nothing will ever recreate what it must have been like to view Jaws on the big screen in June 1975, and some of the effects don't hold up so well (see: the shark vaulting itself onto the boat at the end) but nevertheless, the definitive shark movie is still every bit as exhilarating, bone-chilling, and thrilling as it ever was. Spielberg's direction (and his utilization of the shark prop) is the work of a young hotshot at the flowering of his true talent, adopting what could possibly be described as the best use of the \"less is more\" approach ever, as the shark is kept in the shadow of the water for the majority of the runtime, with both Spielberg and writers Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb realizing that the idea of the shark is even more frightening than the actual thing. The story is also an easily accessible, well-written thriller, that quickly draws you into the serious terror and financial trouble the island of Amity faces as a great white kills and terrorizes its beachgoers, and three men, a cop, a shark expert scientist, and a big game sea hunter, set out to kill the beast (while delivering some of the most quotable lines in cinematic history). And those three men are brought to life by the leads who portray them. Roy Scheider nails the tough-but-approachable demeanor of Police Chief Martin Brody, and Richard Dreyfuss serves as both a source of important information and great comic relief in the form of marine biologist Matt Hooper. However, the true star performer of the film is Robert Shaw, giving a sense of determination, calm, and a little bit of insanity to the role of seasoned shark hunter Quint. And John Williams' iconic theme of terror is just as big a character as the leads and the shark. Jaws is a movie that crosses so many borders, and delivers such an exciting, terrifying, and action-packed tale, that pretty much anyone (minus fearers of sharks or seas) can watch and love it. It is a movie that grossed $470 million worldwide (in a time when it was rare for a movie to gross $100 million), and is a classic, one of Spielberg's finest.",

Everything about this film is fresh, even if it is a little dated in look and sound. Most films today don't ever come off this strong. The dialogue is fantastic, the pace keeps the thing moving by quickly, the cinematography is great and the performances are amazing from everyone. This is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorite films that I could watch over and over again - and most likely will. It would go on to warrant three sequels, a world-famous theme park ride and a horrendous video game. It also cemented itself in, not just popular culture, but everyone's daily lives. The line \"you're going to need a bigger boat\" is probably one of the most quoted lines in film history, said by anyone when something seems insurmountable. The same goes for the awesome Jaws theme, which its composer, John Williams, won an Oscar for. Anytime anyone goes swimming now, someone will invariably sing the tune out loud and pretend to be a shark. Few films have ever had this much of an impact on its audience. Jaws is an absolute masterpiece and, in my opinion, one of Steven Spielberg's top 5 best films.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I love this movie. This is one of those movies that I feel safe when I call it flawless. It was effective back when it first came out and it's just as effective today. A Great White Shark is terrorizing the place called \"Amity Island.\" Roy Scheider plays the paranoid police chief, Martin Brody, and he does a great job. You feel for him when he's doing research on sharks. You can tell that he dreads the idea of a Great White attacking such a small area. He dreads it just as much as the audience dreads when that famous music starts to play. That music composed by John Williams is famous to this day and indicates that a shark attack is inevitable. Throughout most of the film, we don't even see the shark. We only get to see underwater from the shark's perspective. In other words, looking through the eyes of the shark. The suspense is one of the best things about this movie. When the music starts, the sense of fear spreads and you are left wondering where the Shark is at the moment and who is going to be attacked. As the movie progresses, we are introduced to more characters who play a big role in the movie. Richard Dreyfuss plays Matt Hooper, the brainiac of the movie who is whimsical, yet willing. Robert Shaw plays Quint, the tough and resilient sailor who is intent on killing the shark. Brody, Hooper and Quint set off to find the beast in the middle of the ocean and the entertainment only gets better. This isn't just your average shark attack movie; it is character driven. As we learn more about the characters, we connect with them on an emotional level. My favorite scene in the entire movie focuses more on Quint's character rather than the Shark. The trio is in the cabin of the boat at night and are talking about scars they've recieved in the past. Quint then begins his tale of when he was on the U.S.S. Indianapolis the night it sunk. It is a very chilling tale and an underrated movie scene. Robert Shaw does an excellent job in his part. The first time we get a glimpse of the shark is about an hour and a half into the movie. The best thing about it's reveal is that it's so unexpected that you can't help but get creeped out by it. This film is an instant classic and it will never be forgotten. It's one of my all time favorite movies.",

But Jaws is simply not your standard modern monster flick: it's much more than that, and in a really exceptional way too. When I first saw it, I felt it transcended the boundaries that most monster flicks nowadays indulge in: mainly gore. Jaws didn't have gore to a wide extent, and I firmly believe that this added to its effectiveness. However, all this would simply have corroded away were it not for its top notch cast, especially its tripod cast - Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw - and also its supporting cast, including of course Murray Hamilton as an almost babyish-like Mayor. In other respects, the most notable was its terrifyingly suspenseful score, composed by John Williams, which was really a high point. In the end, Jaws had all those elements that make up a great and engaging thriller - plot, performance, music, suspense and monster - well planned, acutely structured, precise, and above all, compelling.",

            "content": "There is a famous saying; imitation is the highest form of flattery. Yet often said imitation can be to the original's detriment, as it undermines its power. But like all classics, it doesn't matter how many tryhard attempts at recreating a masterpiece appear on our cinema screens, there is no denying the pure injection of fear which comes from watching Steven Spielberg's masterpiece; Jaws.\n\nThe story takes place in a sunbaked little town called Amity Island, a town which lives for the summer because the  tourists come to town. But things are thrown into disarray when new-to-town Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) discovers the victim of a shark attack on one of the beaches. Unwilling to lose the influx of customers as a result of the tourist season, Mayor Vaughn decides to keep the beaches open. After the attacks continue, however, Chief Police Brody, icthyologist (read: shark nerd) Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and local shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), unite to hunt the shark down.\n\nSteven Spielberg is the man to be thanking for this masterpiece. Without him, the film could have turned into an uninteresting shark fest which would work for shock value but wouldn't have the devastating impact that it still has today. What could have been a string of disjointed set-pieces is put together brilliantly to make this film one of the greatest horrors of all time. The mystery and restraint shown by Spielberg throughout the film is reason enough to call him a genius, not to mention the expert characterisation which he cleverly weaves in here and there. Each of our characters are fleshed out and 3-dimensional, as well as being equal parts loveable and frustrating. The perfect use of music, the incredible camerawork, the nerve shredding moments of fear, all of it is put together seamlessly by a master at work. There are moments of pure shock and there are moments of extended tension which will have you tearing at the cushion which you hold for comfort. One thing's for certain, it keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe acting in this film is far over and above what you'd get in today's cookie-cutter horrors. Roy Scheider is great as Police Chief Martin Brody. He shows the incredible frustration which his character feels as he is overruled again and again by a man motivated by greed. He shows that he can do humour as well, with wry lines like \"He's in the yard not too far from the car.\" But while he is great as our lead, It's Richard Dreyfuss who steals the show as the more-than-slightly hyperactive Matt Hooper. Like an over-caffinated obsessive-compulsive, Dreyfuss inhabits his character perfectly, showing his indignation, his frustration and his fear with a childlike exuberance which makes him such a likeable character. Robert Shaw plays the almost crazy shark hunter Quint and is fantastic in his role. He mumbles, working class hero-like through his lines \"You go in the cage, cage goes in the water, you go in the water? Shark's in the water. Our shark.\" with a perfect condescending feel which suits his character to a tee. The comradery between these three characters is one of the best parts of the film, and as three initially different characters begin to accept and even embrace one another for their differences, you can almost forget that there is a monster shark on the loose. This is a tribute to not only Spielberg for luring us into a false sense of security, but the realistic relaxation by the actors onscreen which double the effect.\n\nEvery part of this brilliant film works together perfectly in order to create this incredible experience. Yes, accidents on set did make scary scenes even scarier and the experience made Spielberg vow to never film on open sea again, but there's not too many films which can boast that an audience ran out of the cinema, into the bathroom, threw up, and ran back inside to keep watching the test screening. It's a morbidly fascinating and pants-wettingly scary film which have you steering clear of beaches for some time, yet coming back for repeat viewings over and over again.\n\nDefining Scene:\nThat brilliant first death sequence. The combination of John Williams infamous strings and Spielberg's fantastic direction makes this scene unforgettable.\n\nQuotes:\n\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\"\n\"That's some bad hat harry.\"\n\"Here's to swimming with bow-legged women.\"\n\"Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies. Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain.\"\n\"This was no boat accident.\"\n\"Here lies the body of Mary Lee; died at the age of a hundred and three. For fifteen years she kept her virginity; not a bad record for this vicinity.\"\n\"Smile you son of a bitch.\"\n\"I used to hate the water.\" \"I can't imagine why.\"",

Unlike most films in this genre, Jaws actually uses the music in perfect timing to convey emotion from the audience and add a depth to the movie by doing so. \r\n\r\nThe plot is simple to understand, it's about gigantic great white shark beginning to menace the small island community of Amity, a police chief, a marine scientist and grizzled fisherman set out to stop it. Now while this may not sound all that interesting, you're for even thinking all the talented Steven Spielberg knows how tell a story with the camera.

At a little over 2 hours, there isn't a moment where your eyes aren't glued to the screen. If it were any shorter, I have a feeling it wouldn't be nearly as effective. If it were longer, I may have found myself dozing off. But in the hands of the always amazing Steven Spielberg, it's impossible to. A film that scared an entire generation of movie-goers from stepping into the water, \"Jaws\" is quite simple one of the best suspense thrillers ever made. In fact, I have a feeling the film would have made Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense himself, proud. It is proof that Steven Spielberg has always been inspired by him. From the blending of comedy and suspense to provide needed comical relief after hair-rising tension, to a memorable score that pays a homage to Hitchcock's famous shower scene from \"Psycho\", Spielberg uses a variety of Hitchcockian techniques to create suspense. The performances are superb, the writing often witty and funny, and the direction definitely a nod-back to Alfred Hitchcock's style as a filmmaker. If there's one minor problem I have with \"Jaws\", it's that it often lets logic fall under a bus. Take, for example, a scene in which a news reporter is spreading the news of a shark attack at a beach, with people at the same beach in the background. And yet, they still step into the water...seriously? If you're a fan of suspense movies or just love movies in general, \"Jaws\" is a timeless film that you must see as soon as possible. However, just keep in mind that you'll never want to step foot into water ever again.",

I would consider my greatest fear to be the ocean, and not going into into the ocean or swimming, its the idea of being in open water in the ocean and not knowing what is around you.  That is the true horror behind Spielberg's terrifying classic, that people are attacked by sharks all the time.  The story takes place in a fictional vacation island, and this is one island I would never want to visit.  The opening scenes show us what we are in for and really give us an idea of the future of the film, and even though I thought the story would just be an excuse to make a shark film, Spielberg proved to me that even a film like this can have one heck of an adventure.  But what really surprised me about this fantastic script was the characters, who all show the tensions behind people in danger and the consequences of a killer beast that they can't stop.  Roy Schneider is incredible in this film and his dangerous and brave performance really drives the film and gives us a sense of security against the shark.  Richard Drefuss is what I feel was the comic relief, he is a fun and smart character with a lot of humanity and his presence is enjoyable.  Robert Shaw is one of the most memorable characters because of his personality and his characters unique stories and traits.  Jaws could've been some simple summer film that people only remembered for its box-office performance, but instead its a smart, entertaining, intense, well acted, brilliant horror film that started the directing career of one of the greatest visionaries in cinema and became one of my all-time favorite films.",

            "content": "This is my favorite movie of all time.  I have seen it at least 25 times in my life.  It is the only movie that I can watch over and over and over again without getting bored of it to some extent.  Stephen Spielberg is the man, and he is the greatest film director of all time.  What makes him the greatest is how epic his films are.  People to this day are still scared to go into the water, because of this film, and I will admit that I do start to think of sharks when I swim a certain distance from shore.  I have been watching this since I was ten, and it has been my favorite movie since I was ten.\n\nThe film is very different from the book, but I think overall the two are just as good.  In the book I thought that the stuff with the town was a lot more interesting, because they gave more detail about their lives, and describe all of the effects closing the beach would have on the town.  However I thought that the part in the book with Brody's wife was annoying, and I disliked her and Hooper in the book.  I am glad they cut that part out of the movie so the film would be more focused on the shark, and the main characters trying to deal with it.  In the book Hooper is more interested in studying the shark, and he doesn't appreciate the danger of it at all.  He is an ignorant guy who you really dislike in the book, but they made him much more likeable in the film and I was glad to see that he survived at the end of the film.  In the book Quint is exactly the same as he is in the movie, so Robert Shaw gets major props for his performance.  The movie has elements that are better then the book, and the book has elements that are better then the movie.\n\nThe book has a lot more drama in it.  The movie to me was much more suspenseful then the book.  The book had a lot more personal drama, and would go a while without hearing about the shark.  The book had the drama with Brody's wife, the mayor, and all of the things going through Brody's head.  The movie was more suspenseful, because they don't show the shark, or tell you what kind of shark it is until about an hour into the movie.  They also do things like making you wonder what is going to happen, and when.  The book did have a lot of suspense, but the movie was slower so it could build suspense.  Overall they are both equal.\n\nI liked the fact that the shark's movements look mechanical.  The reason why is because they really tried to make the shark seem like it was just some kind of machine, and the fact that it looks mechanical when it moves makes it look like a machine too.  The shark in Jaws is practically a different breed of Great White sharks.  They really do a good job making it seem that way.  However there are times when it looks fake, because of the way it's body looks.  Because of the technology back then, they couldn't give the shark the body flex that most Great Whites have.  When it turns it head left and right it looks like it is being moved by somebody else, because it is mechanical.  Also if you pay close enough attention at first it had a light blue on the top half of it's body, but on the 2nd day out there it looked more like it was more black.  But other then the few times when it looks like it is clearly a mechanical shark, the use of the mechanical shark.  \n\nAn interesting fact is that they named the mechanical shark Bruce on set.  Also at first they were supposed to show Bruce in every scene of the movie just like in the book.  But nobody had ever used a mechanical shark before, and they were trying to get Bruce to work.  Bu they couldn't get Bruce to work in time to start filming so they had to come up with a way to make the movie work without showing the shark until they got it to work.  It worked out for the best, and the film is so great because they waited to show the shark.  I think that is an example of everything happens for a reason.\n\nEverybody knows the famous line \"Your gonna' need a bigger boat.\"  That is an awesome scene because you had been waitng for Jaws to make an appearance, and you can tell they had been out there all day, and then suddenly bam Jaws is there.  It is a really well acted scene too.  When they watch the shark swim past the boat, and you see how long it is.  So amazing.  The best scene is when Quint tells the story of when he was on the U.S. Indianapolis.  It is such a cool scene, and Robert Shaw's acting was so good in that scene.  If you look closely when Brody is out on the bow he grabs a gun, and you see a shooting star go by in the sky.  I am sure they did that on purpose to show, that he wishes the shark was dead already.\n\nThis film has a lot of surprising things that happen that make you jump when you see them, because they are unexpected.  You jump at the scene when Hooper finds the tooth in the boat.  I won't spoil the thing that makes you jump for people who haven't seen this yet, but it freaked me out when I first saw it.  There are several times when they show the shark and it makes you jump.  Though this is not a scary film, it does make you jump at random times.  Some people may find this scary, but I didn't.\n\nThe scene when they first show the shark is one of my all time favorite movie scenes.  First the kids swim in the water with a cardboard fin as a practical joke, but when they finally get busted, a girl on the other side of the island see's the real thing.  It goes into the pond where Brody's son is, and eats another man.  First you just see the sharks fin, but after it knocks the mans boat upside down, you see it's head moving towards the man with it's mouth open, and he gets pulled under water.  It's awesome because of how cool the way they show the sharks head for the first time.  If you have seen the movie, you will know what I am talking about.  That is the thing Spielberg is the master of different camera angles.  He uses the angles to show things in such an interesting way that you always can tell it's his work when you see it.  He and Alfred Hitchcock are the masters at camera work.\n\nNot only is this a great man vs. nature story, but also it is a story of conflict, and hard decision making.  It is about a man fighting against people to do what is right.  Martin Brody knows he must close the beaches, but he is fighting against the mayor to do so.  Mayor Vaughn whom you hate, believes only what he wants to believe.  He refuses to close the beaches, because that will destroy their summer.  Amity Island is a town that makes all of their money during the summer.  It would kill the town to close down the beaches.  You hate him, because you know people are going to get killed because of him, but at the same time you feel for him, because he is in the worst possible position he could be in.  Brody will not get blamed because he wanted to close the beaches so it wouldn't be his fault.  That is the big conflict that he faces.  The mayor is the antagonist in a certain way.  At the end when the mayor learns he was wrong you feel bad for him, because you know how bad he must feel.  That is why it has a lot of conflict, and it is about making the hardest decisions.  That is why it is so good, because no matter what the mayor does he will get heavily criticized for it.\n\nAnother thing about this film is how Spielberg ties his signature style in to it.  Like when the shark dies at the end, you see it sinking, and then you hear the dinosaur growl, while there is very peaceful classical music in the background.  He gives of all of these emotions that no other director has ever given me, by doing things like that.  My favorite scene may be the scene when Brody is sitting at the table, and his son keeps copying all of his motions.  It's such a cute scene, and it is so heart warming that scene.  The heart warmth I get from Spielberg films is different as I said earlier from other films, and that is a great example of it.  The final scene too, when he learns that Hooper is still alive.  It was the same feeling, but different.  It was a more calming, and southing feeling that you got after all of the action stopped.\n\nI am sure after reading this really long review you know why now Jaws is my all time favorite movie.",

It's up to a police chief, an oceanographer and a shark hunter to come together and neutralize this unstoppable death machine.  This movie recently celebrated its 40th anniversary, and it is just as effectively terrifying as if it had come out yesterday.  It is brilliant filmmaking that you don't get to see every day, and Spielberg in his top form is always something that is destined to stand the test of time.  Just like the vast majority of the public, I feel that this movie has incepted a base fear of sharks in my brain.  It's a frightening concept: something you can't see, just beneath the surface, and to top it off, it is engineered by nature to be the perfect killing machine.  Being drown and eaten at the same time has to be one of the absolute worst ways to go, and if you remember anything about this movie, it's likely the opening; you see a young girl get toyed with before succumbing to her sharp, shiny fate.  It gets in your head, and this is the movie that I feel unlocked the secret to psychological horror: it's what you DON'T see that makes it scary.  The infamous prop shark turned out to be a in a blessing in disguise; the original script called for the shark to be given a lot more screen time, but because of technical difficulties, Spielberg wasn't getting the shots that he wanted.  Because the shark is only hinted at through implications, it makes it that much scarier, as your imagination kicks in and fill in every single gap.  You are on the edge of your seat every single minute anybody is in the water because this is so well done, and you don't want to see anybody die, not even the simpletons who attempt to collect the bounty on the shark's head.  All three of the leads give knockout performances; Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw all share a perfect chemistry together, and when shit is hitting the fan, you are in the moment entirely because of their reactions.  One of my favorite scenes of this film is in the third act when they are in the boat, comparing battle scars.  The scene goes from funny, to dramatic, to a drunken sing-along, to scary, and I don't think I've ever seen a movie do that before.  Also, I can't wrap up this review without touching upon the classic John Williams score, and those iconic opening notes are immortally carved in everybody's brains as meaning shark.  It's an incredible movie where the tension only escalates and this is absolutely mandatory viewing material for a countless number of reasons, but also because this is where the blockbuster started.",
