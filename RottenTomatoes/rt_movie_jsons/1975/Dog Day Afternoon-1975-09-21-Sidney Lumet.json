    "summary": "When inexperienced criminal Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) leads a bank robbery in Brooklyn, things quickly go wrong, and a hostage situation develops. As Sonny and his accomplice, Sal Naturile (John Cazale), try desperately to remain in control, a media circus develops and the FBI arrives, creating even more tension. Gradually, Sonny's surprising motivations behind the robbery are revealed, and his standoff with law enforcement moves toward its inevitable end.",

            "content": "La Casa De Papel (Money Heist) straight up rips off this piece of art and trancends it to trash.\n\nWhy does someone rob a bank? There has to be a reason right? Obviously, the first thought that comes to mind is, MONEY! but what's the real reason?\n\nThe story's simple, three amateur (are they really amateur though?) bank robbers plan to hold up a bank. A nice simple robbery: Walk in, take the money, and run. Unfortunately, the supposedly uncomplicated heist suddenly becomes a bizarre nightmare as everything that could go wrong does.\nI just wrote the plot synopsis that's available on IMDb because I want you to personally experience the story unfold as it throws some amazing and shocking reveals about characters one after the other whilst simultaneously making a commentary on a bank robber's psychology (how one plans it, how one manages to follow the plan, what to do if the plan goes sideways and most importantly whyyy do it???)\n\nI started this film due to me having a personal bias for Al Pacino and I think that's what made his performance in this so special for me, he just shines throughout! I cannot appreciate how much I felt for him. Never cared for a single thief in Money Heist (even though they had 5 seasons of character development) but here, felt nothing but sympathy for Sonny (Al Pacino) even when the film's barely 2 hours long! This gotta be one of his top-notch performances.\n\nThe screenplay is just briliant. Screenwriter Frank Pierson manages to reveal info to the audience at the perfect time possible (and that's a pretty hard thing to do by the way) for which he deserves extra praise. The directing of this film is also great, there are no extraordinary shots as most of the film has been shot inside the bank and the street beside but the camera work on display here is exceptional. After seeing the film, when I saw the film's production process, I learnt that most of the shot's have been captured using roller skates so as to allow mobility to Al Pacino's character which is just such a satisfying thing to know!!!\n\nThe only thing that bugs me a bit is the ending but I can't really rant anything about it since it's a true story and they intend to keep the facts as it is and maybe I was expecting more cleverness after the first two acts.\n\nOverall, a must watch film with a completely unexpected motivation for the bank robbers.",

Cazale is also excellent as Sonny's out-of-depth accomplice. The chaotic street scenes, with the watching crowd warming to Sonny and cheering him on, are well handled by Lumet. The film does become a little overextended in its final third, as night falls, and in protracted exchanges between Sonny and his ‘wife' and family, but the hostage scenes inside the bank are superbly written and performed making this one of the most memorable films of its type.",

You will not find your well timed, precisely trained, sunglass clad, and crisply dressed crew anywhere near this film.\n\nPacino's manic energy coupled with Lumet's gritty, almost documentary like, style would have made this a perfectly enjoyable film even without the memorable narrative. There were such interesting and unexpected turns in this screenplay which provided much more depth to the main characters and allowed the audience a more nuanced understanding of the individual motivations driving the plot action.\n\nThe dialogue had some unexpected moments of levity which I thought created a more \"true to life\" tone.\n\nThis is probably one of Pacino's very best performances for me but Charles Durning deserves a shout as he was excellent in support as well. 8.5/10",

            "content": "Sonny's robbing a bank. Why is he robbing this bank? He's desperate. It's the early 70s, and life just feels stuck. He's desperate for love. He's desperate for autonomy. He's desperate to make the people around him happy with their lives too. He's snapped. Is he doing this to help others, or to help himself, or for no reason other than he's lost his grip on reality? \n\nDespite his act of antisocial behavior, his antics have drawn a crowd. Not just onlookers, but participators. They happened to be in the area, and thought why not watch this scene? They've got their good guys, their bad guys – or wait, they've got their bad guys, and they've got their good guys – who do you support in a moment like this? The cops, the same cops from the Attica prison riot massacre, are trying to keep nearly a dozen hostages from being killed. And they're right to be worried. Sal is the real question mark here. The quiet ones are the dangerous ones in these altercations. You've got Sonny, venting his existential frustrations out in front of the cops, the crowd, and the universe. Like a chess piece surrounded by the enemy but protected from a distance by a checkmate blow. \n\nSonny throws money from the bank to the crowd, and they end up trampling each other and a police officer. What are we to take from that? Do we ask about why the bank has the money that the people desire enough to compete with such viciousness? Sonny himself has decided he's not going to play games to get the money he needs for the things that are important to him. \n\nThe press is there too. Making sure everyone knows that Sonny isn't heterosexual. And maybe that's the deepest part of this movie. Sal would rather be killed in a failed bank heist, with no similar motivations to Sonny's, than be even thought of as a homosexual. He hasn't said a word to anyone, and no one has seen his face outside of the bank the entire movie, but he speaks up to the FBI officer to tell him to inform the news that he's not a homosexual. \n\nSonny and Sal fought in the Vietnam war for the country, and they came back without fear of reprisal. They'd already learned that morality requires social order, and in lieu of that, the strong make the rules. The strong make the rules that suit their interests. In this way, coming home from a destabilized war zone, where military generals and guerilla warlords set the moral standards, to a stagnating society where banks and police set the moral standards, it can be no wonder that a man like Sonny, pushed to his financial and emotional breaking points, would make a decision that could change his world. It could change it for good. It could change it for bad. He and Sal decided to kill themselves if they got caught; they'd already chosen death over the lives that would await them, yet Sonny keeps seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. And I think the message is that the light isn't always real. Hope is endearing, but it can be fatal. \n\nSonny lost everything he had. He keeps his pain. His wife remained on welfare. Leon got his surgery, but Sonny didn't pay for it. And that's okay. Relationships come and go. Sometimes your suffering increases while those around you have momentum. Other times your star rises while others fall. Fate befalls us all, and the masters of society should be aware of the side-effects of marginalization. The name Dog Day Afternoon implies that Sonny had his day, after years of toil. But I don't think he did. He didn't have his day. He never will. What he did do, was pull back the curtain and glimpse the power he'd lacked throughout his life. He had the crowd, he had the private jet, and if he died, he had the assurance that his wives would be cared for. He lived, and got nothing. How's that for a moral?",

            "content": "A legitimately funny heist-gone-wrong flick (just a few minutes into the movie, one of the three would-be robbers loses his nerve and just leaves) that gradually shifts to a powder keg built around the national mood in the 1970s. Disillusioned by Watergate and Vietnam, the country is embodied by Pacino's frantic Sonny - a veteran now left a paranoid wreck after being shaken to his core by the past few years' turmoil, and the absence of present opportunity or any promise for the future. Through him the country got to live out a communal passion for anti-authoritarianism, experience the rising LGBT consciousness and presence in the cultural mainstream, and see an unfortunate reflection staring back (Sonny isn't a perfect figure; he's noticeably very flawed, and is holding people hostage at gunpoint no matter how you interpret the situation). In Pierson's screenplay, it's evident that there are clear problems with the established order, but the methods used to combat them aren't exactly problem-free, there are no easy answers.\n\nWhat stands out is the acting talent on display, I've never seen Pacino's more manic tendencies mesh so well with the character he's portraying before. Paired up with a restrained, despondent John Cazale (who is always great, literally no exceptions) and a pair of foils in both the vaguely-inept-but-loud Sgt. Moretti (Charles Durning) and the quiet, dangerous FBI Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) as the two faces of American authority, Dog Day Afternoon is one of the better anti-authoritarian films to come out of the mid-70s cultural melting pot.

Sidney Lumet here didn't achieve the same brilliance with dialogues that Quentin Tarantino did in Reservoir Dogs and The Hateful Eight, at least to my mind. The second block has more energy, and it's almost perfect. More characters are introduced and well-developed, like Leon and Angie, the dialogues are better, the atmosphere is more thrilling and the best phrase to describe the ending is \"WTF?\". I loved how the film concluded. Besides that, the movie makes a social comment about homosexuality and transsexuality, something I would never think to see in a 1975 movie. And to crown this undeniably great picture, despite its slow rhythm, Al Pacino is perfect as Sonny: he is intelligent and smart at the same time he has no idea of what he's doing, due to his inexperience on robbery.",

Sadly, there is not a lot of money in this movie, and that's where things go wrong for the boys. Faced with impossible odds from this botched job, the drama that unfolds between these two brothers in crime is akin to \"Of Mice and Men\", and has a sympathetic disposition as the film exposes the personal struggles that drove them to this situation. We thought it was cool that Pacino made a popcorn connection to Gattica! We don't know why he was screaming it in this movie, but maybe they left it in cause the director is a fan of Gattica too! There was not a lot of music in this movie; it would have been nice if they gave Hanz Zimmer a call. This movie was based on real events and does deviate from the facts here and there. Its interesting that they used Sal's real name and changed the name of the main character in the movie (John Wojtowicz to Sonny Wazowski) even though John is the one who got paid for the story.

Dog Day Afternoon feels like the poor middle class screaming out in frustration at the unfair system and quality of life we are all subjected to, so in desperation, two unprepared men attempt to rob a bank with little preparation for the impending hostage situation. Frank Pierson's script is full of hilarious black humor with a morbid sense of dread. He cleverly dissects the bank robbery genre with conflicted emotions and complex motivations.\n\nSidney Lumet's direction is phenomenal in how realistic every gripping moment of Dog Day Afternoon's harrowing ordeal. It's an entertaining, funny, tragic, and absurd movie that would make for a great farce or tragic play if it were not a true story. Dede Allen's editing is very crafty for the time with long drawn out scenes followed by rapid fire cuts for emphasis. Victor J. Kemper's cinematography is stuffed with heartfelt close-ups that feel all the intimate thanks to Al Pacino's vulnerable and commanding lead performance as Sonny. You feel every moment of uncertainty and anguish from John Cazale as the disturbed and deeply troubled Sal.\n\nYou can see the insecurity and confusion passing across Pacino and Cazale's faces throughout Dog Day Afternoon. It's a beautiful story with a fondness for the LGBTQ community and people struggling with poverty. Dog Day Afternoon feels important, but it's so simple. It hits you so hard because of its moving message and down to Earth performances and Lumet's realistic direction.\n\nStop what you're doing and give Dog Day Afternoon a watch. I found it quite moving and I only hope it touches you as well.",

            "content": "Usually, shit hits the fan in the third act of a heist movie, not here. In Dog Day Afternoon, the bank robber trio becomes a bank robber duo within the first 10 minutes, leaving Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) to carry-out the tissue-paper-thin plan. We know these aren't professionals, as they call each other by their real names, burn papers in a trash can, thereby bringing attention to the building, and conduct their heist so late in the day that the armored truck had already come for the afternoon's pick-up — typically, robbers are so jazzed to score that they arrive too early before any transactions have taken place. It's tough to dislike Sonny and Sal, and they even strike up something of a friendship with some of their female captives, they let the security guard (John Marriot) leave when he starts showing signs of a heart attack, humorously let the women take turns using the restroom, and make sure everyone gets some pizza. When it's revealed that the whole heist, at least Sonny's cut, was to pay for the sex-change operation of his trans girlfriend, Leon, a sort of humanity takes hold and you hope at least he makes it out alive. And for a second there I really thought they were going to get away with their minuscule score — even though I knew this was based on an actual event. Didn't want to see Sal go out that way, but damn that FBI agent (Lance Henriksen) set him up good. It's considered one of Pacino's best performances, if not one of his least recognizable, and it's true, he's electric and gives a full range. You ever hear some college asshole yelling \"Attica! Attica!\" at campus safety? (Okay, that was me.) Well, this is the film the famous line comes from. I often write about how I love films that take place in an NYC I never experienced and Dog Day Afternoon falls perfectly in that category — it's the 70s, it's hot, it's violent, there's John Cazale.",

As for the main protagonist, it took awhile for me to gain a rapport with him, but as his character history started to unravel I started to feel empathy despite still rooting for him to go out in a hail of gunfire. This isn't \"Set It Off\" (as entertaining as that was) - this is a biopic. And in this biopic there is a call to how those tied to the institutions of society are treated, as opposed to the those that never get the opportunity to speak. Would Sal have been given Sunny's same treatment if he too was a war vet and an incidental spokesman for homosexual activism and mental health advocacy, but purposely the director never lets the viewer get that perspective by maintaing the primary focus on Sunny as he half-heartedly attempts to pull off a bank job while really trying to become a martyr in the process to leave the institutions that he is so tied to behind, ending with him institutionalized once more while his accomplices both cowardly and brave are in their own ways set free.\n For a character penning his will in the middle of the film to throwing money at the crowd claiming he's a hero, Pacino delivers Sunny as the ultimate anti-hero for the audience : in his selfishness you can hate and relate and in his selflessness you rally around him like a saint. Only movie magic can make a story rooted in this reality this compelling and while watching \"Dog Day...\" (or nodding off on it, damn thing needed an intermission) I cant help but have my belief in fairy tales renewed while knowing this won't end pretty.",

We get to really know and understand our protagonist and his motives. Additionally, the supporting cast isn't filled with one-dimensional characters as well. The employees of the bank act accordingly and Sal played by John Cazale is always worried and uncertain of how it'll play out now that they're surrounded. The more unnoticeable aspects are executed in a manner to further the film without distracting you, such as the editing which allows for a perfect pacing of the worsening situation. Overall it isn't too fancy or huge in aspirations, but what it does accomplish with what it has is very impressive. Nice work from Sidney Lumet in directing this classic.",

            "content": "Director Sidney Lumet has always had an ability to interrogate the media's influence on society, whether it's the radical politics in Network (1976) or the glamorizing of a criminal in this film. What seems like a slight concept is compellingly stretched out to feature length here as we see how the plight of this one man effects those around him and the willingness of others to profit off of him and then quickly abandon him. I can't say that I loved this film but I did admire how well it was constructed and could of course appreciate the fact that the distinguished cast puts in great performances. This film was also a part of the incredible 1975 Best Picture lineup and while it is my least favorite of the five films I still find a lot to appreciate in it.\n\nFather and husband Sonny Wortzik, Al Pacino, decides to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank in an attempt to pay for the sex change of operation of his longtime lover Leon Shermer, Chris Sarandon. Accompanying him is Sal Naturale, John Cazale, who is equally inexperienced at robbing banks. When the two arrive they quickly realize that they have not adequately planned to successfully rob the bank and discover that all of the money had already been collected before they arrived. They attempt to extort the police through bargaining with the hostages and Sergeant Eugene Moretti, Charles Durning, is kind to Wortzik and attempts to diplomatically negotiate with him. Wortzik decides that he wants a plane to fly himself and Naturale out of the country to another nation and speaks to his lover and his wife before he departs. With the arrival of a new negotiator Wortzik realizes he is in over his head and tragedy strikes when he eventually reaches the airport he was meant to depart from.\n\nPacino gives one of his most famous performances as the crazed, incompetent bank robber who is driven by a deep and genuine love even as he threatens to shoot several innocent women. He uses his wild eyes to great effect here as we are absolutely convinced that he is insane but the occasional dropping in of his knowledge of the day to day operations of a bank encourage us to believe that there is a certain intelligence behind his dogged persona. He has the thick New York accent and the mannerisms that we have come to expect from him but in many ways this feels like his most naturalistic performance as he is asked to seem vulnerable even with a gun in hand and an off kilter personality. You feel for him as he talks to his lover for the last time and realizes that his love is not returned by him but terrified of him as he screams at a stuttering Carol Kane.\n\nLumet's direction is masterful, as it so often was, as he constantly reminds us of the wider implications of this event and the small scale of Wortzik's efforts to extract this money someway, somehow out of the police. He is smart to let the pacing slow down in the second act as even I was shocked by how quickly the first stages of the robbery progress. This was obviously a deliberate decision to show how, as the robbery slowed down, so did the media and public interest in the event leading Wortzik and Naturale to become burnt out and bored instead of passionated and concerned. Shockingly, Lumet never won an Academy Award and while 1975 was too competitive of a year for him to deserve the Best Director award he should have been rewarded for 12 Angry Men (1957) one of the greatest films of all time.\n\nThe end of the film is depressing as we see a man we care about die but there is a finality to this tragedy that feels in keeping with the realistic tone of the film as a whole as losing this man forces Wortzik to wake up to the reality of his situation. Yes, we get the usual postscript informing us of the fates of the many characters we followed but this was not an average bank robbery film and the characters will stay with us for a long time because while they were unsuccessful they had good intentions and their flaws were real and human.",

The pacing is fantastic, there are many political underlying themes(the lower class's revolt, transgenderism) and it came out at a time when there was much disconcert on the streets of America. It is truly a great film and its reputation has only increased with time. Watch this one. 8/10 (Watch it for Lumet's crisp direction and Pacino's acting). Solaris (1971):  Stanislaw Lem's Solaris is a highly regarded book and Andrei Tarkovsky's film adaption is pretty much spot on, though Tarkovsky being an auteur brings his own touch to the proceedings. The story is about a cosmonaut who is sent to a space station revolving around a mysterious planet in the future. The cinematography and production design are haunting- the spaceship is so different than what we usually see in Hollywood. The acting is restraint and works here. Some people have said there is a sense of pretentiousness and rightfully so as some scenes go on way too long. But hey, this is Tarkovsky we speak of.

He's bumbling and ill-prepared as the leader of this bank heist, yet he's cagey and street-wise as a New York rat.  \n\nWe first get a glimpse of how amateurish these criminals are when one of the three bails early on in the robbery, which is a comical moment.  We also smile at Pacino's handling of the situation.  He realizes the importance of the hostages he suddenly finds himself holding, but far from being heavy-handed, he tries to be decent with them.  He whips the crowd up into an anti-establishment frenzy by shouting \"Attica!\", throwing wads of money into the air, and paying for pizza delivery.  He gets into a shouting match with a police sergeant (Charles Durning).  He talks to his wife, mother, and transgender lover (Chris Sarandon), and each conversation is touched with pathos, and fantastic.  To his mother he says \"I'm a fuck-up and I'm an outcast. If you get near me you're gonna get it.  You're gonna get fucked over and fucked out.\"  It's the outcast underdog that we find ourselves rooting for.\n\nI love the simple acceptance of his sexuality, which is incidental and doesn't devolve into some type of stereotype - well ahead of its time.  Director Sidney Lumet shows the seamy side of New York, but at the same time, its humanity.  The characters are blunt, but understanding of one another when they simply say what they want.  The relationships in this tense stand-off are fascinating.  \n\nI also liked how Lumet gets us into the story immediately.  We learn the backstories and characters of the criminals, including Pacino's henchman (John Cazale) gradually, and in little moments, such as finding out he fears their escape plan because he's never been on an airplane before.  The film works as both a hostage drama and as a character study.  It may be a teeny bit too long at 125 minutes, but has held up well over the years, and is definitely worth watching.",

As for how the real story of his character -- a mediocre bank robber turned local TV star of the day -- is told, picture a freshly sharpened knife being used over the course of several years, still sharp enough to cut but noticeably duller. Director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson search to agree on a single point of view, as they examine different dimensions to the day-long tale. And in many isolated scenes, they really are on point when it comes to media scrutiny, crowd mentality, contemporary relations with authority figures, etc. Speaking of contemporary times, you gotta give some credit to the two for detailing a truthful relationship between Sonny (Pacino) and his to-be-transsexual wife Leon (Chris Sarandon). Sonny knows how to play a show, and so does Pacino. There is a catch to empathizing for Sonny, under Lumet's vision. By the ending, we lose some of the important context that Sonny and his partner Sal (John Cazale) have been holding several people as hostages for the entirety of the day, outright saying to each other that, if necessary, they are ready to kill. This is intentional for the final twist to come out of nowhere, and in its execution, a job well done. Who do I care about then? Hostages, certainly, I want them to be safe. The police, fuck them. The FBI, goddamn, fuck them! The bank robbers, um... They deserve punishment, but be easy on them...? A good true story to snag, with great dark humour bolstered by Pacino, but, if Lumet wanted to complete his analysis on small felony justice, he may have fared better by taking inspiration from the story instead.",

In the early parts of the film, I thought it was going to be a simple story about a bank robbery gone wrong. In reality, that is exactly what we get for the first act. Then things start to transition and it becomes almost a satire of how the media spins a story like this, and how people can idolize a sympathetic criminal. What I never saw coming was the explanation of why Sonny is committing the crime. That twist was hidden from us for at least half of the film, and when it is revealed it amazed me. Dog Day Afternoon was so ahead of its time, and it doesn't approach the topic in an offensive or mean-spirited way. Of course this is just a subplot to the main story, and whenever it got back to the simple hostage crisis I wasn't nearly as impressed with the movie. The conclusion had the stakes set high, and built up a lot of tension. Unfortunately, I think they telegraphed the ending a little too much, so it didn't pay off with a finale that lived up to all that came before. However, I have to hand it to Dog Day Afternoon for being progressive, and Al Pacino for delivering a superb performance.",

            "content": "If you have been a fan of any Al Pacino role and you have not seen Dog Day Afternoon, you have not yet experienced all that Al Pacino can offer. Dog Day Afternoon is by far Al Pacino's best work, and yes, I've seen The Godfather films. Sidney Lumet's 1975 feature Dog Day Afternoon showcases a depth of Al Pacino that I was unaware existed. Also starring John Cazale, Dog Day Afternoon explores the debilitating feeling of being torn in two directions by the world around you. The crisis one may confront by not being able to live their identity pushes Al Pacino's Sonny to rob a bank in order to get the money for his lover's sex-change operation. Gritty, true, and soul-crushing, Lumet proves his directorial force while bringing out the best in Al Pacino to illustrate the depths one will go through to save himself by saving those around him.\n\nOn a hot summer day in Brooklyn, New York, Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) set out to execute their plan to rob the Chase Manhattan Bank. After weeks of mulling over their plans, coordinating delivery times, casing the outside and learning the best times to attract the least amount of attention, they finally enter the bank. Sonny is at a time of extreme desperation in his life. He is in a listless marriage to his wife and two kids, and he desperately wants to rob enough money from the bank to afford his partner Leon's (Chris Sarandon) sex change operation so the two may live together full-time. Sal, the understated partner in crime, a listless man seems to have no direction in his life and is easily brought into the scheme by the promise of riches from the heist. The bank manager and teller staff agree to not interfere with the robbery, even helping the downtrodden robbers as best as they can. Thinking it will be a quick in and out affair, Sonny and Sal are rushing through the job until they realize that there is little money in the bank, as a majority of the money was taken out of the bank that same afternoon. Before they can escape, a call comes in from the police department that they have the bank surrounded. What began as a robbery quickly develops into a hostage situation as Sonny sees his plans foil all around him. Eventually, feeling sorry for the men who continuously vow not to hurt anyone, if they even could, a kinship develops between Sonny, Sal, and the bank employees. Now seeing the only way out as a jet out of the country in exchange for the safe release of hostages, Sonny unwillingly turns into a captor continuously negotiating the release of hostages and listing demands. At the depths of his own despair, Sonny prepares for the worst while hoping that he can still manage to make a life out of the mess he had before he ever stepped into the bank.\n\nThis is one of those films that you watch and you hardly realize there are any other actors in it besides Al Pacino, he steals the show that much. Within the first 10 minutes, you could see the nuance brimming over the top of Pacino's characterization of Sonny. The most incredible part of this film, which also shows the directorial prowess of Sidney Lumet was that by the 10-minute mark, the duo had already entered the bank. A film that jumps into the action so early in the film also falls victim to poor pacing, especially considering that this is a film that takes place largely in one place. The pacing was never a problem in Dog Day Afternoon; each wrenching minute that elapsed emerged the audience even deeper into the mindset of Sonny and the desperation he was experiencing. I am a huge fan of films that take place in one setting, and I never thought I would like one more than I liked 12 Angry Men, also by Sidney Lumet, (obviously it's time for me to watch even more of his films) but Dog Day Afternoon takes the crown of best one setting film, in my book anyway. One setting films are so hard to do well, oftentimes, they come off stiff or too theatre-like, but Lumet knew what he was doing behind a camera leaving audiences with the best in the genre. You feel the desperation of Pacino's portrayal in such a way that stays with you days after viewing. Dog Day Afternoon is a standout, more than earning all of its critical acclaims. What a miss for Pacino from the Academy that year!",

He's like this crazy, humorous guy that matches his expressions, he's just unbelievable in this film. The only flaw that I saw on this one, are those slow dramatic moments inside the bank which is kinda unnecessary, which still it says the side of the hostages.

And I found this movie to be great. the acting is top notch of course from Pacino and Cazale. and it is very capably directed by Sidney Lumet. the first hour of this movie is perfect from the dialogue to the attempted robbery and the great suspense that doesn't let up. however around the halfway point, the movie dragged a little bit as yiu find out more and more about Sonny as a person. certain things are revealed about his character and his motivations for the robbery, and although it is interesting and important, it slowed the pacing down a lot. the movie is also not predictable at all which is a huge plus for me personally. Overall this movie deserves to be a classic, it is great, the pacing was just a tad bit off and you don't learn much about Sal as a character which were two flaws that brought the movie down from what I was hoping would be a 10/10. still very good. \n\n7.8/10",

            "content": "The prime goal of a bank robber, besides immediate financial gain, is efficiency, and this is for a number of reasons. Nobody wants to hear the story about a successful bank robber for the very virtue that he was successful and, on that particular day, evil won. The immortalized stories and the ones that get repeated through generations, or, in this case, get movies made about them, are those that were peculiar or not-so successful. An inefficient bank robber has more of a probability of their identity being discovered, their alibi in case of indictment being compromised, or their ultimate goal of getting the money and running being corrupted by the police, who's prime goal is also efficiency. The issue is that robbing a bank can go a number of different ways and nobody really knows what will happen until it is happening.\n\nThese reasons and more are why the story of John Wojtowicz is so intriguing. Based on the true story - a story so absurd that it must be reiterated time and time again that it is indeed rooted in fact - of a bank robbery taking place in Brooklyn back in 1972, Dog Day Afternoon follows three men, Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino), his friend Sal Naturale (John Cazale), and another accomplice named Stevie (Gary Springer). The three men attempt to rob the First Brooklyn Savings Bank one morning, and the plan goes awry almost immediately when Stevie loses his cool and abandons the two men after Sal first draws his gun. In another unfortunate circumstance, Sonny and Sal realize they've chosen to rob the bank right after the daily cash pickup truck has arrived, meaning the bank only has around $1,000 in the vault.\n\nSonny attempts to make up for this circumstance by stealing the bank's traveler's checks and burning the bank's ledger that keeps track of all of them. The smoke from the small blaze alerts nearby businesses and law-enforcement of suspicious activities, and what was supposed to be a routine, by-the-numbers robbery becomes a hostage situation and a media spectacle. The incompetent and defeated Sonny winds up attempting to hold the young, female bank tellers hostage, as well as maintain his cool long enough to request enough supplies and transportation to get him and Sal to safety as quickly as possible.\n\nThe problem is that, throughout the course of Dog Day Afternoon, nothing happens as quickly or as conveniently for the characters as possible. The result is like watching a pathetic bank robbery put on by a band of Saturday Night Live cast members, as both Sonny and Sal are stuck between a rock and a hard place throughout the entire film. This also makes this particular film so interesting because of its constant situational humor that seems to keep building and developing as the film goes along. Nothing goes right for the characters, despite their efforts to make things work, and that's one of the fundamental building blocks of comedy that director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson constantly toy with.\n\nBy classification and its inherent nature, Dog Day Afternoon is a crime drama. It centers around a bank robbery and, regardless of how ill-conceived and managed such the bank robbery is, its narrative is ultimately fixated on a crime. Having said that, it's worth noting how seamlessly Lumet and Pierson interweave comedy and dry wit into the film's narrative, not turning the contents of the story into a laugh riot desperate for uproarious reactions from the audience, but allowing the pathetic characters and the poor circumstance to work for themselves and create comedy very naturally. It's only right that Al Pacino, an actor who can play both low-key and over-the-top, often in the same film, lead the cast as a character who, throughout the course of the film, looks like the personification of an unattended pot left to hopelessly boil over on the stove with nobody in sight to save or cool it down.\n\nDog Day Afternoon's sole setting and slight number of characters allows for familiarity in faces and locations to build very elegantly. Neither Lumet nor Pierson get too caught up in the spectacle of the entire event and shift the focus away from the interior meltdown to the commotion occurring outside. I'd actually be hardpressed to believe, at least after seeing this, that a short film centered around a successful bank robbery captured in one setting would be as tense as this. The unpredictability and the sheer lunacy of all that is unfolding really assist the film in creating something so crazy without gratuitous shock value that it's truly something to behold for all of its one-hundred and twenty minutes.\n\nStarring: Al Pacino, John Cazale, Gary Springer.

            "content": "\"Come on, now. Who do you think you're dealing with? A fucking idiot here?\" Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) asks the employees of the bank he's attempting to rob as he scurries about unmasked, without a plan, and with a partner (John Cazale) who thinks Wyoming is a country.  If he didn't have such a big gun and wasn't in such a reckless emotional state, then I might, if in the shoes of the head teller, respond with a hard yes.  But I'm a nice guy without enough good sense to avoid messing with the slightly unhinged - to sit back and bathe in the pathetic events of this criminal train wreck might be better for my health instead.\n\tAs audiences, we have grown accustomed to robbery-based films that glide by with lightweight finesse, the cinematic population consisting of a few too many \"Thomas Crown Affairs\" and \"Italian Jobs\" to prove that, in actuality, most crooks are bumbling, not suave.  So it's no surprise that \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is based on real events - in the nonfictional world, slippery Steve McQueens and Michael Caines do not exist.  We are, unfortunately, stuck with unbalanced Al Pacinos who leave us ripping out hair out rather than ricocheting back in fear of their sinful prowess.  \n\tSonny is a man acting out of desperation, not rationality, and that's what makes \"Dog Day Afternoon\" such an enormously involving film; it is more concerned with why the guilty parties are so bent on committing high-attention theft than on the crime itself.      Sonny is not a playboy nor a mastermind but a perpetual loser whose life is all work and no play - it is a workout to simply psychologically ready himself to wake up in the morning.  He is party to a failed marriage and a party to a dying extramarital affair; but Sonny, it seems, is more driven by the latter, as it acts as his motive for robbing a bank.  His lover (Chris Sarandon) is in dire need of money to fund a sex change operation.\n\tIt doesn't take long for the robbery to turn into an event, as Sonny isn't much subtle and catches the eye of a group of policemen perched across the street - minutes later is a crowd attracted, the hold-up becoming a major hostage situation.  The public loves him: they see him as an anti-hero standing up for the 99% (until his sexuality is revealed and they turn into a body of jeerers).  But two dim-witted men cannot hinder the movement of bank tellers for very long - especially considering the FBI soon camps out in front of the building - and Sonny is eventually forced to come to terms with his reality, and how an act of spontaneity is no way to go about changing one's life.\n\tBest about \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is its cockeyed humor; robbing a bank and threatening to kill a group of vulnerable women is no joke, but it sees the human comedy that forms when society's most prominent outcasts get it through their heads that they can emulate Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid without a blueprint in mind.  No one in the film actually feels threatened.  They are so entertained by the spectacle that surrounds them that even the hostages themselves are having a good time.  \"My place is with my girls,\" the head teller replies to a cop who pricks her with the idea of the opportunity to run away from the building in hopes of escape.  She sounds heroic, but she likes the attention of the media, and Sonny is not enough of a threat to make her want to discover safety.  Similar is a pizza delivery boy who shows up at the front steps of the bank to serve Sonny and company's dinner; \"I'm a star!\" he shouts after he collects his cash.\n\tI suppose \"Dog Day Afternoon\" could be looked at as a biting media commentary, but it is more compelling of a film when viewed as a character study.  It begins with the tone of a black comedy, but little by little is the sheer tragedy of the situation revealed, particularly when we meet Sonny's lover for the first time.  Then and there, we come to understand just how parched Sonny is for some sort of a normal life.  Not committing a crime is not a thought that passes through his head.  He can only see the end result, which is a crooked view of happiness that even he can't seem to understand will never arrive.\n\tPacino, at his most formidable in the mid-1970s, gives one of his greatest performances in \"Dog Day Afternoon,\" though his characterization can hardly be called a \"performance\": he becomes Sonny, not with actor contrivance but with ease encapsulated by a mere twitch of an eyebrow.  Charles Durning, as the lead detective who does most of the negotiating, is excellent as a man not concerned enough to take extreme measures but concerned enough to sacrifice his reputation for the safety of Sonny's hostages.  Most startling, though, is Sarandon, whose uncanny ability to portray an underlying hurt causes our hearts to ache as he makes up for the judgment Sonny so heartily lacks.  \n\tCinema has changed a lot since the 1970s, and one can only wonder just how much of a success a modern-day film equivalent would be - are present audiences as capable of absorbing a gripping character study that never changes location, that relies solely on a handful of accomplished actors? \"Dog Day Afternoon\" is an intricate configuration of what Sidney Lumet does best: finding entertainment, consolidation, sympathy, in people.",

            "content": "After seeing it on the big screen for the first time, one thing I took away from the film when I reflected on it was that this film is similar to early Spielberg works in a way.\n\nWhat I mean by that is I read a book on interviews done with Spielberg, which touched on the idea that his early work revolved around stories where the media was involved somehow; the media looking at the event was an undertone of the film. In Dog Day Afternoon we get these aerial shots of Sonny outside the bank that captures what an event this was to the public - hundreds of extras as policemen, the media and the general public trying to catch a glimpse of the excitement of a bank robbery.\n\nSonny even becomes an icon to the public when he says he doesn't want people killed, and gets people in an uproar when he reminds them of a similar situation in Attica (I believe) a short time ago. We see the people's reactions change as it is revealed that he has homosexual lover; some give him hate but he draws the attraction of the gay community.\n\nAnd these people aren't even inside with him as we are, missing out on how he acts in person. We see a performance by Pacino that cries out desperate and excitable in the best of ways. We see him stumble over problem after problem with the robbery, but he refuses to give up. He's a smart guy, having worked at a bank before, so it breaks him when his foolproof plan goes haywire in all sorts of directions.\n\nJohn Cazale is also in this film, and from what I have seen him in I say that he is a very underrated actor; without saying much in the film he has to pull of his character with subtleties, not exaggerations, and he does this very well. His best scene in the film is when he is being accused of being a hypocrite since he thinks the body should be protected since it is god's temple, yet he is in the process of robbing a bank.\n\nThe film seems to drag at points with overly long sequences leading up to when transportation to an aircraft arrives for them. That doesn't mean these sequences lack content; there is a great moment when Sonny is making his will in case he dies before getting on a plane, but it feels like we wait half an hour between steps to his plan. Also, I was unimpressed by the actor who plays Sonny's lover.\n\nMy friend pointed out that this film is somewhat anti-climactic but I didn't really think a big climax was necessary for this film, though I get his point. This is a great work of art that makes me want to watch more of Lumet's work in the near future, such as 12 Angry Men or Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.",

            "content": "It's nigh impossible to think of this movie without one word ringing like a Church Bell inside your head over and over: Attica! Attica! Attica! Shouted relatively early on during its running time, it is arguably the most deeply resonant element from a movie made way back when the heady optimism of the 60s Hippie era was dead and buried. In a decade when the common man was at a loss at every step, our main character Sonny, played with all with the right notes by Hollywood heavyweight Al Pacino, is the embodiment of that misfortune, and along with his hapless partner Sal, a very understated John Cazale, robs a bank in broad daylight, and things seem doomed from the get-go.  Sidney Lumet crafts a movie which is funny, suspenseful, claustrophobic, and constantly keeps you guessing which way it's going to swing. Pacino is electrifying as the leading man who goes from petty thief to folk hero in record time, and you can see why the masses would love such a character. One of the primary strengths of the movie is that we see the action from both sides: The robbers and the authorities, and are constantly forced to question who are the 'good' guys and who are the 'bad', and if such a line can be so clearly drawn. The movie opens with a frenetic energy, and if it could sustain that throughout the film it would be mind-blowing. Alas, the film begins to drag as it becomes evident there isn't enough story or action to fill its rather excessive length, and so we are forced to endure some unnecessarily long scenes and even longer exchanges of dialogue. It does get fairly boring, but the positives are just too good to ignore. The first half of the film alone is worth the price of admission. The second half, not so much.",

Based on a true story from 1972 of a bank robbery by John Wojtowicz and Salvatore Naturile Dog Day Afternoon is a gritty heist movie starring Al Pacino as Sonny who we later discover is a Bi-sexual. Unlike most heist films nothing goes to plan for Sonny and his dim witted sidekick Sal, arriving at a bank with no money their great heist quickly falls apart leaving Sonny to try scheme his way out whilst having no intentions to hurt anybody. Arguably one of Pacino greatest roles we see the characters depth as his reasons for the attempted bank robbery are revealed as well as a deeply tortured soul. The film shows the exploitation of the media industry, as we discover more of Sonny's humanity the media turns him from Robin Hood anti hero with the onlookers cheering him on, to a crazed blood thirsty mob mocking his sexuality and condemning his actions. Overall 9.5/10 the conclusion could not be more Hollywood however as the clixmatic showdown is the true story this is a perfect example of life imitating art, this gritty crime drama is a must see America Classic.",

            "content": "Nunca había podido ver este filme, y como gran admirador de la actuación de Al Pacino, siempre había querido poder verla. Por dicha, finalmente pude verla y ciertamente es una excelente película con un estilo genial que logra amalgamar drama, violencia y comedia, que ahora es algo normal cuando se ven filmes como los del Quentin Tarantino, pero en 1975, ciertamente Sidney Lumet logró presentar un producto políticamente incorrecto, de la manera correcta. Ya que actualmente me parece que los estudios y filmes van más y más en el camino de la sociedad pusilánime como se presenta en \"Demolition Man\" que podrá ser muy \"sana\" pero han perdido los \"huevos\" y que son un reflejo de lo que ciertos sectores de la sociedad ahora influencian el efecto que provocan las opiniones de otros. Este filme es basado en un artículo publicado en la revista Time, describiendo la singular situación generada debido a un fallido asalto bancario y la subsecuente asedio de la policía alrededor del banco que dura horas. Lo que primero me sorprendió (pero de forma positiva) es la gran cantidad de ironía, humor y situaciones hilarantes que este filme tiene. Como no la había podido ver, creí que era un drama crudamente violento, pero que realmente presenta esta sui generis combinación de estados de ánimo que se pueden traducir en simplemente una apropiada representación de la vida misma, de la vida real. Ya que esto es como el asunto del secuestro de la Embajada de Chile en nuestro país hace unos años, era una situación seria, un incidente que generó muertes, algo para no tomar a broma, pero es inevitable notar las ironías y momentos cómicos como ver pasar corriendo para arriba y para abajo a los policías para que los vieran en cámara, luego como estuvieron \"negociando\" por 2 horas con un hombre muerto, etc... Y aquí, con situaciones diferentes, es eso mismo, es un asalto bancario, que genera una situación de secuestro y largas horas de asedio por parte de la policía tratando de solucionar la crisis, pero que está inundada de humor, de situaciones que si usted tiene sentido común no puede evitar reírse a carcajadas. Este filme me recuerda también obras como \"Las Fisgonas de Paso Ancho\", como algo pequeño explota en un incidente que llega a involucrar a todo el barrio, igualmente aquí, en el filme, algo que inicia en una sucursal bancaria insignificante, llega a detonar en un incidente que toda la ciudad estaba siguiendo, aglomerados en las calles adyacentes del evento, en sus casas siguiéndolo por TV, y hasta saliendo a las calles cuando la historia los \"alcanzaba\". Una soberbia actuación de Al Pacino, quien es sin ninguna duda, el actor preciso para poder interpretar su complejo personaje, apoyado por John Cazale, que ya tenía experiencia de colaborar con Pacino en la saga de \"The Godfather\" y que aquí saca a relucir todavía más su capacidad histriónica. El brillante elenco de \"cajeras bancarias\" donde cada una aporta momentos geniales en la narrativa y donde ciertamente Penelope Allen (que fue una madre sustituta en la vida real de Pacino cuando era adolescente), Marcia Jean Kurtz y la entonces desconocida Carol Kane (\"Taxi\" TV Series), pero también casi cada personaje principal y secundario llegan a tener sus \"cinco minutos\" de gloria para demostrar su valía de estar presentes en esta brillante película. Ganadora del Oscar a Mejor Guión Original (que si estaba basado en un artículo de la Revista Time, debería haber sido considerado un Guión Adaptado) pero que también es un mérito de todo el elenco ya que es sabido que a la gran mayoría del elenco se le permitió improvisar (con infinito éxito) muchos de sus diálogos. Nominada a 5 Oscares más, y que la Revista \"Empire\" declaró en el 2006, la actuación de Al Pacino en esta cinta, como la #4 de las mejores 100 de todos los tiempos. Es sin duda una de esas películas relevantes todavía hoy en día que todo mundo debería ver (y espero saber apreciar su genialidad) alguna vez en sus vidas. Attica! Attica!",

The fact that this bank robbery scene actually happened is what makes the movie more compelling to watch, especially the fact that it happened in Brooklyn, New York 1972, and where else better to have a crazy bank robbery in New York, where the most impossible happens. Al Pacino gives without a doubt one of his most best and iconic performances ever in Sidney Lumet's \"Dog Day Afternoon.\" Sidney Lumet is no joke of a director, after wtaching \"Serpico\" today I thought I would give \"Dog Day Afternnoon\" another shot since I had mixed feeling about it when I first saw it, but I was just a kid then driven on action flicks, but now seeing it as a young adult I can say this is without a doubt one of the best movies EVER made. The time period for the film is captured so well and the performances between Pacino, John Cazale (Who always amazes me) Chalres Durning has the New York hostage negotiator to even Chris Sarandon who plays Pacino's gay lover Leon, to hell even having Lance Henricksen as the FBI agent that drives Pacino, Cazale and the hostages to JFK Airport with the rtest of the hostages is enough for me as a movie buff to love this movies especially since it is so well directed by Sidney Lumet who I desperately have to start getting into after watching \"Dog Day Afternoon\" again. This is a movie that keeps you glued to your seat from beginning to end and truly deserves to be in the ranks of the 100 best Hollywood movies ever made. This was made during ther Golden Age of Hollywood as I truly believe the 60's and the 70's was the best time for movie making as so many memorable movies came out around then. \"Dirty Harry,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" \"The Godfather Part 1&2\" \"Saturday Night Fever,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" but that's just the 70's but you get the point. But there is something about \"Dog Day Afternoon\" that just sticks in the back of your mind when you watch it because it truly is a remarkable film and deserves to be one of the best American movies ever made and no one can take anything from that....not even the FBI\n agents in this movie lol.",

Police Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning) leads the police, who surround the bank. By the point, Sonny and Sal's actions have attracted a crowd, most of whom now seem to be cheering on the actions of Sonny and Sal. It's a well made film, done on a low budget, but the performances by Pacino and Cazale are the glue that hold the film together, Pacino is like a firework, whereas Cazale has a calm energy, admirably underplayed.

            "content": "Sidney Lumet is the master of making a fantastic drama out of something that takes place in one location and Al Pacino is the master of giving outstanding performances and never winning anything for it. Dog Day Afternoon is a great film where everything goes wrong for our characters in the first 5 minutes and it only gets worse from there.\n\nWhether or not this film sticks to what actually happened, and from what I've read- it doesn't, the film feels very real, it has a documentary style feel to it all and it makes it feel very authentic. For the first 20-30 minutes, at least, it looks like a continuous shot and again it feels very authentic, it looks like we are watching a real bank robbery happen where everything goes wrong, so the filmmakers did their job fantastically. I also like how there is no music, it just increases the realism, even to the point where the end credits happen and they just appear. \n\nAl Pacino knocks it out of the park by doing something a little different and does a fantastic job, and has our undivided attention. His accent was very good just like everything he was doing, a lot of the film was improvised and added to the script later (which was a good idea because they won their only Oscar for the script) and it comes across on screen in the best of ways. Not that its badly made but the fact that Sonny needs to think of everything on the spot comes across great and we're left wondering what could go wrong next. It's perfect casting, not only because he does a brilliant job but because he looks like the real Wojtowicz, which he was actually compared to when the robbery happened. It's also a fair portrayal, we get to see why he's doing this and really gains a lot of sympathy. I think Durning should have been nominated for an Oscar, he gave a great performance and worked with Pacino great. Sarandon also did a great job and I liked the build up to his character and his eventual reveal, it's subtle and surprising. John Cazale was good as usual... For what they gave him.\n\nWhile we get to understand Sonny and see why he's doing what he's doing, John Cazale almost had nothing to do and we really don't learn anything about his character at all. We get snippets here and there and a very touching scene about cancer because of what happened to him but he's really underdeveloped. While that might be true to what happened in the real robbery and he wasn't really the focus of the event, it doesn't make for a good character. I also think the film was too long, it was around the hour forty mark that I thought this but I can't really think of any scene to take out, those scenes are important to the plot and nothing in this film is filler. It tells its story and ends straight away. \n\nDog Day Afternoon is a very impressive film that actually has quite a few nice surprises in store, given some of the subject matter, it is a very respectful and quite impressive thing that was accomplished in 1970s cinema. One character laughs at something Sarandon's says and everyone looked at the guy that laughed in shock and I really liked that moment. With great acting and directing, Dog Day Afternoon tells its odd story in the best of ways.",

            "content": "August 22, 1972-Two young men hold up Brooklyn's Chase Manhattan Bank at closing time. What begins smoothly quickly goes awry, leading partners-in-crime Sonny Wortzik and Salvatore \"Sal\" Naturale to inadvertently take the bank's employees hostage in a desperate attempt to escape the 200 policemen surrounding the building. The media immediately gets involved, allowing locals to immerse themselves in the melodrama and use it as a distraction from the late summer heat wave. A crowd of intrigued onlookers swarms the bank, observing the ongoing events and loudly expressing their reactions in equal parts cheers and jeers. Sonny finds himself in a position of celebrity, a would-be spokesman for the workingman, fed up with union wages and discontent with what his country has to offer him. His initial popularity vanishes when his supporters instantly turn on him after a local news station exposes his homosexuality and reveals that the motivating factor behind his criminal behavior is to fund his partner's sex change. \nThis dramatization of real-life events comprises the narrative of Sidney Lumet's 1975 film, Dog Day Afternoon, a \"naturalistic\" work that sits firmly within the pantheon of 70s cinema (Hollywood's \"Golden Age\"), a genre of films made between 1967-1976 that is defined by omnipresent themes of isolation, hopelessness and disbelief in the American Dream. In an era when \"movies mattered,\" filmmakers chose projects that responded to and commented upon the defining cultural and political aspects of the time. Elements of these films included French New Wave stylism and neo-Western narratives, typically following morally ambiguous (often male) protagonists to an ambivalent conclusion and conveying nihilistic themes along the way. Late 60s counterculture had an obvious impact on the genre, as many 70s films carry overt anti-authority messaging, Dog Day Afternoon included. \nA perfect storm of changes within the studio system and America's cultural climate allowed for this renaissance of filmmaking to occur. As a self-censoring industry, Hollywood once had a strict Production Code, which subsequently fell apart in 1966, allowing for more grown-up films to make it into the multiplexes. Simultaneously, Hollywood began to alter the ways it financed its movies and allowed directors more creative control over projects. The Production Code and studio system provided little room for \"auteurs\" (Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock stand as notable exceptions), so Hollywood directors with distinctive styles did not emerge until the late 60s. Around the same time, the audience for films began to gear toward the younger \"rock n' roll\" generation, so morally ambiguous screenplays covering subject matter such as pot-smoking drifters (e.g. Easy Rider) suddenly looked much more lucrative to producers.\n  By the time Dog Day Afternoon came around, Americans had survived a decade of social division in response to the Vietnam War, perpetual loss of trust in American politicians (and authorities) due to Nixon and-of most relevance to this particular film-crippling economic recession. The first two of these trends could not have unfolded the way they did without the sensationalism of modern media (notable moments include the Tet Offensive and the live broadcast of Nixon's Watergate testimony), a development that forever changed American culture. The instant celebrityhood attained by news coverage even managed to incentivize criminal behavior, leading fame-hungry individuals to commit acts of violence in exchange for notoriety.\n\tBased upon a 1972 LIFE article entitled \"The Boys in the Bank,\" Dog Day Afternoon contrasts the media's portrayal of events with the deeper realities that actually comprise them. Within the film, the media presents to the public a bizarre tale of a homosexual gone mad. Lumet's camera instead exposes a deeply human portrayal of a desperate man trying to support his loved ones, and for the first time in his life, be somebody. This instantly accessible humanity goes on full display to reveal the media's corruptive ability to alter events and sway public opinion. As Roger Ebert wrote in his original review of the film, \"The presence of reporters and live TV cameras changed the nature of those events, helped to dictate them, made them into happenings with their own internal logic\" (Chicago Sun-Times). Lumet attempts to capture all of this and more with Dog Day Afternoon.\nBorn in Philadelphia but raised in New York City, Sidney Lumet began acting at five years old, appearing in Yiddish theatre productions that his father produced and directed. He would later study acting at Columbia University and direct Off-Broadway plays for a few years before moving onto television in 1950 during the dawn of the so-called \"Golden Age of Television,\" a breeding ground for many of the key players in 70s cinema. \"Lumet has suggested that the key to his talent as a director may well be his origins as an actor,\" Joanna E. Rapf writes in her compilation book, Sidney Lumet: Interviews. This background likely contributed to his reputation as an \"actor's director,\" or someone who could \"deliver powerhouse performances from lead actors, and fine work from character actors\" (Thomson). This skillset, and his working relationship with New York City (an omnipresent character in 70s film) catapulted Lumet into the top tier of directors with the help of a string of successful films, including 12 Angry Men, The Pawnbroker and Serpico. Lumet's varied choices in directorial projects quickly established his fierce \"anti-auteurship,\" with which he denounced the idea that \"good\" directors need to have their own recognizable style. Perhaps fittingly, several critics have pointed to Lumet's lack of noticeable aesthetic as a weakness in his skillset. \nWhen Lumet initially chose to take on Frank Pierson's screenplay in 1974, he had reached the point in his career where he not only had great freedom in choosing his projects, but he also held the coveted right of \"final cut,\" the privilege of deciding-without studio interference-which cut of a film got released to theatres. \"I'm pretty sure that if I want a new writer on the script, the studio or producer would let me pick one,\" Lumet writes in his autobiography. \"Final cut is a tremendous source of security\" (Lumet 48). To give a sense of Lumet's clout at the time, fewer than a dozen people working in Hollywood held this privilege. His critical and commercial success up to this point secured studio funding for Dog Day Afternoon with relative ease-no small accomplishment, and this at a time when producer Robert Evans had to fight bullishly to get Chinatown made. \nIn the original LIFE magazine article, journalist P.F. Kluge describes John Wojitowicz (Sonny) as \"a dark, thin fellow with the broken-faced good looks of an Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman\" (Kluge). By 1974, each of these actors had already contributed heavily to the mythos of 70s cinema, Hoffman with The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy and Pacino with the first two Godfather films. Having worked with him on Serpico in 1973, Lumet cast Pacino in the part of Sonny. \"It was a remarkable group. Pacino led them with a mad courage I've seen only two other times,\" Lumet writes (Lumet 33). One of the earliest Hollywood stars to subscribe to the \"Method\" school of acting, Pacino had shown time and time again his ability to embody characters right down to their smallest tendencies, from Frank Serpico's pervasive paranoia and androgynous swagger to Sonny nervously toying with his pocket watch. By juxtaposing his vastly different performances in Godfather Part II and Dog Day Afternoon, released within a year of one another, one can begin to comprehend the dedication young Pacino had to his craft. He and Hoffman, among others, made way for a new type of leading man in an industry that had historically only hired those who fit the bill of \"Hollywood Handsome\" (e.g. James Dean, Cary Grant).\nAfter securing the role of Sonny, Pacino insisted on the casting of his friend John Cazale as Sal despite the actor's twenty-year age difference with his real-life counterpart. As a character actor, Cazale had already turned in a remarkably consistent body of work, having played habitual screw-up Fredo Corleone in the first two Godfather films and Harry Caul's (Gene Hackman) starry-eyed coworker in The Conversation. Lumet then chose relative newcomer Chris Sarandon to portray Leon, a gamble that clearly paid off, as he received an Academy Award nomination for his performance. To contribute to the film's naturalistic feel, Lumet cast untrained actors as bystanders and even as minor supporting characters, including the pizza delivery boy who famously proclaims, \"I'm a star!\"\nLumet continued to round out the important positions in his crew with formidable 70s figures, including editor Dede Allen, who had established her tendencies for innovative, New Wave-style cuts in films such as Bonnie and Clyde and Serpico. Lumet had developed a close relationship with the renowned editor on the latter film, as the two worked closely to edit it concurrently with production to meet time constraints set by the studio (Lumet). Finally, Lumet chose Victor Kemper (The Friends of Eddie Coyle) as his Director of Photography to \"reinforce the film's documentary feel\" (Lumet 89). Despite complaints from the studio, Lumet chose not to commission a score for the film, as he felt he could not \"justify music weaving in and out\" of a project designed to imitate real life (Rapf). As a result, the film's only music comes in the form of Elton John's \"Amoreena\" during the opening credits.\nLumet's significant amount of creative control led to some tensions with studio executives and screenwriter Frank Pierson. \"You have euchred us!\" an anonymous production manager yelled at Lumet through the telephone (Lumet 35). He expressed anger over a scene the director had chosen to cut from the script, which included footage of Sonny and Leon's real-life counterparts' wedding. Lumet thought it would inspire too much sensationalism and render audiences incapable of relating to Sonny, while the studio saw it as a marketing opportunity to build up the film's notoriety (A common tactic; just a few years earlier Midnight Cowboy sold tickets using the tagline, \"Whatever you've heard about Midnight Cowboy is true.\").  Final cut allowed Lumet to have his way, and he replaced the footage with a picture of Leon in his wedding dress. \n\t\"The first obligation was to let the audience know that this event actually happened,\" Lumet said of Dog Day Afternoon's distinct visual style, though he may as well have been talking about Pierson's screenplay (Lumet 88). Lumet and the cast improvised upwards of 60 percent of the film's dialogue during table reads, a staggering amount, but a decision that led to naturalistic characterizations by each of the key players. It also provided for much of the film's trademark humor. Legend has it that Cazale improvised his \"Wyoming\" line, which acts both as a recurring joke and an effective bit of character development. Lumet even left a few scenes (including Pacino's infamous \"Attica\" speech) for improvisation on the day of shooting. Of course, all of these improvisations resulted in an almost complete rewrite of Pierson's original dialogue. People commonly joke about writers getting slapped around in Hollywood, but Lumet insists that \"[Pierson] was selfless and devoted to the subject matter. The actors may not have said exactly what he wrote, but they spoke with his intention\" (Lumet 34). Lumet calling the shots on set may have allowed for a more holistic take on the material, but the other players' contributions should not be underestimated. Pierson won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay and, according to Lumet, \"he deserved it\" (Lumet 34). \n\tUpon its September 1975 release, Dog Day Afternoon received almost universal acclaim from the major critics, with much of the praise falling upon the film's darkly hilarious dialogue and Pacino's moving performance as Sonny. \"The interactions between Pacino and other key characters are magnificently written, acted and directed,\" writes the staff of Variety. Pacino had established himself as something of a critic's delight by this point, having earned their allegiance early on with his performance as a heroin addict in 1971's The Panic in Needle Park. \"[Sonny] becomes one of the most interesting modern movie characters, ranking with Gene Hackman's eavesdropper in The Conversation and Jack Nicholson's Bobby Dupea in Five Easy Pieces,\" writes Roger Ebert (Chicago Sun-Times). The film went on to earn five Academy Award nominations, including one for Pacino, though its only win was for Pierson's screenplay. The film found box office success as well, capitalizing on its broad and timely cultural appeal to earn $50 million off of a $1.8 million budget (Lumet became notorious for finishing productions under budget, having picked up a tendency for thrift during his time spent working in television.). The movie holds up to this day, and stands tall as some of Sidney Lumet's finest and most culturally impactful work, providing poignant commentary on the modern era's exploitative media and the humanness behind seemingly absurd behavior.  \n\"The televised image certifies the reality of events and, at the same time, removes them by equating their meaning to that of the commercials-the cheerful haiku-that frames them.\"-Vincent Canby; New York Times\n\tCanby included the above piece of wisdom in his 1969 review of Medium Cool, an extraordinarily meta film about the media's role in inciting politically-charged events. I would argue that it applies more accurately to Dog Day Afternoon, in which a man finds both a voice and an audience by lashing out at the world, only to realize that his actions represent little more than a distracting freak show on the periphery of a hot summer afternoon. The public values him and Sal based upon their entertainment value and little else. The local media feeds this furnace of exploitation to feverish heights for the sake of its own ratings, simultaneously piquing the public's interest in the story and preventing them from seeing the relatable truths behind it. The public sees a man madly screaming \"Attica!\" and hurling money at riotous crowds. They see a man crazy enough to have a drag marriage presided by a defrocked priest. What they do not see is Sonny Wortzik, a loving husband and father who grew disenchanted with life and wanted one last shot at changing things for himself and for others. \n\tLumet wastes no time in setting the tone for this humanization, opening the film with a montage of everyday events in order to achieve the opposite effect of the media's sensationalism. The five-minute opening credit sequence (featuring the aforementioned \"Amoreena,\" a moseying tune with lyrics about everyday life) serves to set the film's overall feeling of normalcy. Instead of building up tension toward the bank robbery, we barely even notice when it has started. As city noises begin to drown out the music, Lumet transitions seamlessly from hidden-camera footage of New York City to a shot of Sonny, Sal and Stevie sitting in a car outside the bank. \"They seemed like just one more shot of a group of people on that oppressive summer day in New York,\" writes Lumet (Lumet 57). This visual aesthetic provides the viewer with no choice but to acknowledge that these are normal people, not unlike the ones shown immediately beforehand. \n\tWhile much debate amongst film academics goes into the definitions of Realism and Expressionism, Lumet has said that Dog Day Afternoon's aesthetic falls more along the lines of \"naturalism,\" or \"as close to documentary filmmaking as one can get in a scripted movie\" (Lumet 54). In some ways, this approach provides for fewer esoteric conversations regarding shot composition and imagery. It makes Dog Day Afternoon entirely different from a more expressionist work like Citizen Kane, in which nearly every freeze frame tells a subliminal story. Lumet and Kemper craft a visual narrative that observes the characters and events without necessarily commenting on them; the camera draws as little attention to itself as possible. This commitment to naturalism demanded that Lumet and Kemper use no artificial lighting (the only lights used to shoot inside the bank were the ceiling fluorescents), shoot exclusively on location and-for many of the indoor sequences-use handheld cameras. They could have easily shot the film in a more conventional manner complete with neorealist imagery and archetypes, but Lumet believes that style stems from \"organic connection to the material\" (Lumet 51). Of course, for him, this meant a visual story that matched the narrative one, which itself shows the humanity behind a so-called freak. He could not further sensationalize Sonny's actions. On the contrary, he attempted to reverse the damage the media had already done. \n \tAs the credit sequence comes to its conclusion, we find ourselves observing what quickly establishes itself as a bank robbery. Stevie (Gary Springer) walks casually, hands-in-pockets back to a beat-up car in which Sonny and Sal sit. He says something inaudible to Sonny, who proceeds to shut off the radio (implying the characters could hear \"Amoreena,\" yet another example of Lumet's dedication to naturalism), prompting Sal to walk up to the bank, take one more look back at the car for self-assurance, and enter the building. Exterior shots of the bank show its guard (John Marriott) lowering the flag and locking the doors behind customers, implying that the bank will soon close for the day. Sonny-with a suspiciously long package under his arm-and Stevie enter the bank, putting in motion history's most prolonged failure of a heist. \n\tThese early moments with our protagonists prove instrumental both in terms of characterization and in making obvious their impending doom. As Lumet writes, \"Inevitability is the key... The script must keep you off balance, keep you surprised, entertained, involved, and yet, when the denouement is reached, still give you the sense that the story had to turn out that way\" (Lumet 31). Sonny and Sal hurdle toward their self-made ruin, which makes itself obvious as soon as the former fumbles around when withdrawing his rifle from its packaging. Sal projects a stoic intensity that seems to suggest barbarism akin to that of Hannibal Lecter, but will later reveal itself as something else entirely. Stevie then gets cold feet and-in a move surely designed to establish the film's comedic tone-rushes out without even thinking to leave the keys to the getaway car with Sonny. All of hope of a successful robbery seems lost, but wait! Sonny quickly goes about reestablishing a cool professionalism that matches his two-piece suit. He makes a series of quick-witted moves, suggesting an intelligence that seems contradictory to his already long list of screw-ups. \"We'll just move it right along,\" Sonny says repeatedly, presumably to reassure Sal and himself that they are still in control of the situation. Pacino runs back and forth across the bank floor with a bug-eyed intensity, drawing the blinds then blacking out the cameras to prevent video transmission. When the bank manager goes to open the vault, Sonny barks at him not to trip the alarm using the \"spot key.\" A spot key? How many people know what that is, let alone how to differentiate it from the real key? He similarly rejects the head teller's (Penelope Allen) attempt at giving him decoy money. Sonny soon reveals that he used to work in a bank and that he is a \"Catholic so [he] doesn't want to hurt anybody,\" thus flipping the audience's initial assumptions about him and quickly turning him into a puzzle that the viewer is asked to dissect. \"Sonny is many things and wants to be all things,\" Ebert writes (Chicago Sun-Times). Sonny seems to think this of himself as well; he at one point declares, \"I know a lot about a lot of things.\" Lumet and Co. proceed to reveal those \"things\" to the viewer in a manner befitting of the film's quasi-documentary trappings.\n\tAs previously stated, the film makes obvious the bank robbery's failure to the viewers, even if they are not aware of the events it is based upon. After burning the registry in another example of his recurring foolishness, Sonny gets a phone call from a group of policemen in the building across the street. \"We've got you right by the balls,\" says Sergeant Eugene Moretti (Charles Durning). \"You don't believe me? I'm looking at you right now. Right now I can see you.\" An immediate look of panic in his eyes, Sonny glances through the window and sees a stereotypically fattened cop pointing at him. While the screenplay does not reveal how the cops came to know of the robbery, Kluge's original story details a conversation in which Mulvaney (Sully Boyar) sends a coded SOS while on the phone with a client. As Moretti and Sonny converse, the camera does not immediately opt for the standard reverse-angle shots that filmmakers usually use to dramatize conversations, but instead stays with Sonny to keep the faux-documentary's focus consistent. \"Look, I told you to get out of here while you could, but you just had to hang around,\" barks Mulvaney. Sonny and Sal drop to the ground in despair, but their story has hardly begun, and is yet to become media frenzy. \nAs the narrative progresses, Sonny and Sal's character development occurs in two arcs that seem to contradict one another: via their exchanges with the other characters and the local media's (as well as the authorities') attempts to uncover their backstories. Lumet's viewers get to know the complex man that Sonny is simply by observing his uneven behavior. He first tells the police that he will \"start throwing bodies out the front door\" if they approach the bank and uses his status as a Vietnam War veteran (supposedly, though this is likely untrue of Sal since he admits to never having flown in an airplane) to validate this threat, but he then allows the bank's employees to take phone calls with their loved ones and even use the bathroom. \"He's the kind of man who would take care of you,\" Pierson once said of Sonny (Rapf). Sonny verifies this statement repeatedly, as he makes sure to cater to his \"hostages,\" even going as far as to order them pizza and teach them rifle twirling. Sal's seemingly ice-cold demeanor similarly fails to hold up under scrutiny once he reveals his silence to simply be isolation when he suggests that he and Sonny shoot themselves. The accessibility of these two becomes even more apparent once Sonny calls into question his own opinion about whether or not the authorities are the good guys. \"They'll shoot you, you know? The cops...you see what they did in Attica? 42 people they killed, the innocent with the guilty\" he says to Mulvaney. The film seems to affirm this point when, just a few minutes later, incompetent police officers nearly shoot an asthmatic security guard as he exits the bank. \nAt this moment, the turning point occurs in which the media makes Sonny into a local celebrity, giving him the power to captivate the attention of nearly everyone in New York City. Meaningful high-angle shots show both police and media helicopters alike flying overhead, symbolically linking the two. The camera cuts to Pacino, who barks back and forth with Moretti in one of the most intense improvised confrontations ever set to film. In the meantime, buses full of armed policemen arrive, adding to the purposefully absurd number of them already on the scene. Realizing he can call the shots for perhaps the first time in his life, Sonny runs back and forth like a Shakespearean protagonist delivering his soliloquy. \"Get back there!\" he yells, pointing at a cop. \"He wants to kill me so bad he can taste it! Attica! Attica! Tell them to put their guns down! Put your guns down!\" The newly formed mob cheers, screaming \"Attica\" in call and response. Then, in an oft-overlooked but powerful moment, Sonny proclaims, \"If it wasn't for the TV guys they'd kill us all!\" In a perfect example of intentional sequencing, the film then cuts to Sonny's parents watching the news coverage on television, affirming that the media does in fact alter the course of events for everyone involved. Sonny's mother was watching live coverage of her son's tragic downfall from the comfort of her own living room. This serves to reveal to the film's viewers an essential component of Sonny's character (his Freudian mother issues) while contrasting this inside knowledge with what the news anchor tells the public. This type of juxtaposition occurs again after Pacino's second outdoor demonstration. Lumet chooses to cut to Sonny's wife Angie Wortzik at home with her two kids, ranting about how crazy her husband has been acting lately. The pieces of his character start to come together for the film's viewers, but the public still sees only a charismatic bank robber. Sonny has become an instant celebrity, impregnable because of the public's irrational obsession with him. He feels the power this gives him and capitalizes upon it as much as possible, needlessly yelling slander at the policemen to draw a response from the crowd. Even the bank's head teller panders to the audience when Moretti tries to keep her outside. \"They're my girls, I'm going back in there!\" she says, with a smile and a wave to the laughing crowd. She excitedly runs back into the bank to brag to her \"girls\" about her live television interview. If this wholesome, maternal character is controlled by a desire for any small amount of fame, then surely all of us are. \nSonny soon recognizes that he does not possess a real voice to speak to the people, as evidenced by his declaration to a newscaster: \"I'm here with my partner and nine other people, and we're dying, man. You're going to see our brains on the sidewalk. They're going to spill our guts out, and you're going to show that on television, have all your housewives watch it instead of As the World Turns?\" Sonny knows that he and Sal represent a freak show to the public and little else.\n Small bits of character development continue to occur within the bank, including Sal's insistence that cigarettes \"taint the temple of the Lord,\" but the true shock to the film's viewers as well as to the onlookers within the film comes when Leon arrives. It's important that Lumet and Co. choose to deliver this information to both audiences at once. The film's viewers find themselves shocked at first, just like the mob of onlookers, but we then get the joy of peeling back the layers of Sonny's complexity. We see the media's coverage of the revelation and the aforementioned photo of Leon in his wedding dress. The newscaster then cuts to a commercial break and says, \"We'll be right back with coverage of two homosexuals robbing a bank.\" In a particularly funny reaction, Sal whines to Sonny about the false reporting. The news station has no basis to assume Sal was also gay, and yet they say it anyway to stoke the public's interest in the event. As Bob Dylan famously said in an interview with Time magazine, \"They've got too much to lose by printing the truth...you know that!\"\nIn Dog Day Afternoon's tragic last act, Lumet allows the viewer to more fully comprehend Sonny's motivations, imbuing the character with nearly universal accessibility in order to critique the media's dangerous tendency to distort the reality behind events. The camera follows Sonny through a sequence of two phone calls: one to Leon, and the second to his wife Angie. The first is a desperate plea for forgiveness, an apology for failure and a sorrowful goodbye, while the second is resentfully done out of a sense of obligation (\"the kind of man who would take care of you\"). With Leon, we feel Sonny's love come through in an honest and affecting way, as the back-and-forth close-ups of Sarandon and Pacino tell a powerful narrative simply via facial expressions. Lumet filmed this scene twice in back-to-back unbroken takes to build up Pacino's level of emotion as much as possible. \"By the end of the second take, Al didn't know where he was anymore,\" Lumet writes. \"His eyes locked into mine and he burst into tears, then slumped over the desk he had been sitting at\" (Lumet 122). This level of raw emotion provokes a visceral reaction in the viewer, creating an instant sense of connectedness to Sonny that is more deeply personal than anything the media could ever convey, as if it would ever want to. The similarly affecting Last Will speech that Pacino delivers serves the same function of providing insight to the film's viewers that the mob outside the bank could not hope to comprehend. At this point, their sole relationship to the event is still just the initial shock of learning about Sonny's homosexuality. Visually, we see this when-after the phone call scene-the camera cuts to the street, where gay rights activists chant \"Out of the closets and into the streets!\" Viewers of the film can see the depths of Sonny's complexity, but the public remains fixated on his sexuality because of the media's sensationalist coverage. \n\tMany people would argue that the film's most important message lies in its anti-establishment ideals, which make themselves apparent in the portrayal of the police force as inept public servants who oppress the people. The cops' stupidity shines through on multiple occasions, including when they let an angry bystander through the barricade to tackle Sonny, or when the tactical unit behind the bank fails to communicate to the ones out front that they are going to try to sneak through the back window. This messaging culminates with the film's denouement, when a lieutenant brutally shoots Sal-with whom the audience sympathizes-in the face (A conscious decision on Lumet's part to alter what happened in real life, in which they shot him in the chest). I do not argue against this reading of the film, as I think it works alongside my critique of modern media to comprise effective social commentary. However, I do believe that Dog Day Afternoon functions best as a critique of the media's sensationalism and man's obsession with fame. It is a deeply human portrayal of someone whom the public may mistakenly label an outcast, or as Lumet puts it, \"Freaks are not the freaks we think they are. We are much more connected to the most outrageous behavior than we know or admit\" (Lumet 14).",

Oft blieben seine Filme sogar hinter meinen Erwartungen zurück (wie z.B. bei Network oder Before the Devil Knows You're Dead).\n\nMan kann zusammenfassen - ich liebe Lumet nicht, aber ich schätze ihn doch als Regisseur und will immer noch mehr von ihm sehen.\nDog Day Afternoon war in zweierlei Hinsicht auf meinem Radar. Einerseits als critic's darling, IMdB Top 250 und Oscar Nominierter und andererseits als Hauptrolle von Al Pacino.\nPacino war wohl sogar der Hauptgrund, dass ich den Film gesehen hab, und gerade als Pacino-Fan kommt man auf seine Kosten. Mitte der 70er Jahre war Pacino noch nicht so oft typegecastet, und hatte eindeutig noch ein weiteres Repertoire als den missmutigen, alkoholischen Schreihals. In Dog Day Afternoon ist er zurückhaltend, fast schon introvertiert und gleichzeitig ein brodelnder Vulkan. Diese Zurückhaltung lässt ihn um einiges gefährlicher erscheinen als den tobenden cholerischen Schreihals den er heutzutage für gewöhnlich mimt.\n\nDie Rolle des Sonny Wortzik ähnelt in gewisser Weise Serpico oder auch dem Michael Corleone des ersten Godfather-Teils. Alles in allem, würde ich Dog Day Afternoon als seine zweitbeste Performance nach meinem Favoriten Scent of a Woman reihen.\n\nLumet setzt ihn gekonnt in Szene. Hier beweist sich die Qualität dieses Regisseurs: er ist präzise, ein genialer Stimmungsbildner und ein Kenner der Proxemik. Großartig setzt er den begrenzten Raum der Bank in Szene und lässt die Kamera um Pacinos Sonny herumtanzen. Geschmeidig offenbart sich das Geschehen vor der Kamera und doch hat man das Gefühl mittendrin zu sein - Teil der Geiseln oder des Inventars zu sehen, und immer wenn Sonny vor die Bank tritt wird man zum Teil der gaffenden Menge.\nIch kann nicht genau erklären wie Lumet das macht. Es wirkt teilweise sehr naturalistisch, ist es bei näherer Betrachtung aber nicht. Ich denke, es ist eher der klassische, unsichtbare Hollywoodstil, verfeinert, und auf die Spitze getrieben. Lumet ist ein Mann der Diegese, des Geschichtenerzählens mittels unsichtbaren Schnitts und nach strengen Regeln. Er muss wohl der Meister dieses Filmstils sind, nur so ist es zu erklären, dass er über fünfzig Jahre hinweg zu den renommiertesten Hollywoodregisseuren zählte, und dass er die Revolution des New Hollywood überlebte.",

But then there's Al Pacino, whose performance is so adrenaline-filled and emotionally palpable that it catapults this film from great to a masterpiece deserving of classic status and every bit of acclaim it gets. This is a near perfect film, and it's influence is well-deserved and very apparent in today's heist and thriller films. Oh, and not to mention the very well placed comedy that is exemplified by the fact that all the hostages are just chilling in the bank being buds with the bank robbers, smoking and eating pizza.

The events that conspire are based on actual happenings and that just makes the movie experience more enjoyable.  This is more than a film, it is a social statement.  The cast does an excellent job of bringing this to life despite the fact that they worked in a very limited film setting. The main protagonists Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) attempt to rob a bank only to find that they are surrounded by NYPD within minutes of the thefts commencement.  Dog Day Afternoon takes place almost entirely in this New York bank and that is really one of its major strengths.  Direction from Sidney Lument makes the audience feel like they are in the bank with Sonny and his hostages.  During the film I often felt that I was Sonny, just trying to think of a way to get out of this extremely difficult situation.  Al Pacino contributes to this film with an always dependable performance.  He brings Sonny to life.  Combine this with a realistic script and an excellent plot and you have the cinematic experience that is Dog Day Afternoon.  Though this film is primarily a thriller with some funny moments, it is also a tragic drama about the consequences that come with violating the law.  If there is one theme in Dog Day Afternoon it is that crime does not pay.  I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys a good thriller/drama and an overall quality movie experience.",

Sunny and his band of robbers become more like rock stars than robbers to the people outside the bank watching as the police try to negotiate with them.\n\nWhile Dog Day Afternoon isn't action packed or fast paced, it's a classic film that everyone should see at least once.  It's great fun and gives a look at a young Pacino early in his career and forming his craft.",

This is film is good on every level and that's why this is such a well made film. One of the things that makes this movie so great is Frank Pierson's terrific screenplay. The movie's screenplay was just terrific because it had a really interesting story that had me invested while also having some great characters and some great dialogue. Sidney Lumet does Pierson's screenplay justice because he did a fantastic job directing this film. Lumet did a great job at creating suspense in this movie but he also did a good job at balancing the drama in the film and the humor in the film. In this film you have Al Pacino as the star and he is just brilliant. Pacino is just a terrific actor and he just knocks it out of the park in this film. To me Pacino's performance in Dog Day Afternoon is one of the best performances of his entire career. The supporting cast is also magnificent in the film which includes John Cazale, Chris Sarandon, and Charles Durning. Overall Dog Day Afternoon is a terrific film that I highly recommend seeing.",

Dog Day Afternoon follows a man named Sonny Wortzik (Pacino) so desperate for cash he attempts to rob a bank along with his friend Sal (John Cazale). A job which was suppose to take minutes turns into a downard spiral for the pair as they can't escape from a sticky situation.\nThe film is absoloutly exhilarating from start to finish, Sonny is an amazing human being to say he is robbing a bank you can't help but sympathise with his life story which unfolds throughout the film, to back this up the hostages move around freely and seem to enjoy the antics. As for Sal his character seems very on edge, a ticking time bomb waiting to unleash chaos. The chemistry between the Al and Johnny is very realistic and i really did route for the two to make it out alive.\nWhat i thought of the plot is that it was almos too spoofed to be true. Fans was cheering Sonny's name as he came outside to negotiate with the cop, Sonny really was infectious in his human spirit to the point the cops was humbled in his presence. Sonny was so in control of a what seemed a ridicoulous situation that it seemed unreal to be a true story.\nOverall Dog Day Afternoon is an absoloutle thrill ride, an amazing film with references to a french new wave cinematic style giving the film the sense of realism in time and space with helicopter shots and energetic shots. This film for me is a sentimental piece of art which should be enjoyed by women and men alike due to the social issues the film implies, racism, sexuality and equality.",

            "content": "I knew (before watching) that this film had had its fair share of critical acclaim and I was keen to give it a look. Thereâ(TM)s something in the title that conjures a picture in my mind of a violent bank siege; boy was I in for a surprise! It is most definitely not what I was expectingâ¦ so slow I had to keep checking my pulse to see if I was still alive! Donâ(TM)t get me wrong, Iâ(TM)m all for a slow paced taught drama, but this one didnâ(TM)t really work for me. Iâ(TM)ll tell you why after this very brief summary.\n\nWhen Sonny (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale) rob a bank in Brooklyn on August 22nd 1972 they get more than they bargained for. Based on a true story, the events of the day slowly unfold. The men take too long getting out and find themselves trapped in the bank with several hostages. The manager, Mulvaney (Sully Boyar) is very cooperative, as is the chief teller, Sylvia (Penelope Allen); even so, the police are soon in touch in the guise of Moretti (Charles Durning). What follows is the usual thing; promises made in return for a hostage or two. Before they know it there are large crowds outside and the whole thing has become a media circus with Sonny even being interviewed by phone live on the air! As all this is going on we learn more about Sonnyâ(TM)s life and his motivations for committing this crime. As things progress the FBI takes over the negotiations in the form of Sheldon (James Broderick). He is much more with the programme and events begin to move more quickly. Is there a way out for these men though?\n\nQuite a daring film for its day, showing events almost exclusively from the point of view of the robbers. There seems to be a little Stockholm Syndrome going on where the hostages begin to identify with their captors, but this isnâ(TM)t explored too closely. All the performances are very good with Pacino doing some of his very best scenery chewing with Cazale consequently playing it down and very understated (I liked that). It didnâ(TM)t work for me though because I never bought into the stories we learn about Sonny; itâ(TM)s him the film concentrates on mostly. He seems quite savvy when it comes to banks and police/FBI procedures and yet still panics when the police first arrive. I never had any connection with for either of the robbers and so found it quite a bumpy road to go down. Having said that I thought it was well made but certain scenes came across like a bit of an improvised scene in an acting class. I doubt Iâ(TM)d watch it again, but at least itâ(TM)s another I can cross off â~The Listâ(TM).\n\nSteelMonsterâ(TM)s verdict: RECOMMENDED (â¦just)\n\nMy score: 6.1/10",

Sidney Lumet directs the bank robbery in several directions and situations and he ensures they all hit hard. The screenplay is also very strong here and supports the actors as well as the movement of the film.\n\nThe Acting is the high point of Dog Day Afternoon. Chris Sarandon's flamboyant and emotional portrayal of Leon was very good, and next to it was John Cazale as  a haunting, introverted character.\nThe Best part, however was the intense and loud performance given by Al Pacino. As flawless as ever, Al Pacino gives a performance of Sunny so finely that it's one of his greatest. It's loud, it's conflicting, it's intense, it's AL PACINO! He blends elements of Tony Montana and Michael Corleone into this one, and when he shouts \"ATTICA! ATTICA!\", thats the moment you realize he is perfect for the role.\n\nDog Day Afternoon features dynamics used fairly commonly in films now, so to see one of the earliest portrayal of such events in Dog Day Afternoon is great.",

The performances in this film were excellent, Al Pacino and many others like Charles Durning were great.  \r\n\r\nA bit long (over 2 hrs), I think there were some redundancies in the editing that didn't need to be there...too many helicopter shots.  What makes this film interesting is that the man was gay and was married twice.  Also he got the community hating and loving him at the same time.  The mom, the wife, the gay wife who needed a gender operation, all great characters. \r\n\r\nA great film, definitely worth a watch, probably not going to watch it again though.  The performances are probably the strongest thing about this film.  Everything else is solid but not amazing.",

Two bank robbers run into some outrageous hiccups while robbing the bank. An accomplice backed out in the last minute. One bank robber tries to be smart and burns a register in a bin. The smoke attracts a passer-by, risking being caught. After going through all the trouble, the bank vault is actually left with a small sum of money only. Then, without a clue, they are on national TV, surrounded by police, TV media reporters, a huge crowd and ... gay supporters. Al Pacino's character is a bisexual who is married to a chubby woman with two kids and has a guy he claims to be his wife. He robs the bank for his sex change operation. It is afterall a comedy?\n\nNot really. The second half sees the movie declines into darker depths. It ends in a tragedy. I really hope the movie will end with a lighter note. It feels unbalanced. \n\nBased on true events so I kind of cannot complain much. \n\nRating: B",

The movie has a great plot, Al Pacino's character and his friend rob a bank, Al Pacino's character, Sonny, wants it for his gay lovers sex change, you know, turning his lover into a woman... Point is the movie's still amazing. It's one of those movies that I could watch a billion times. Absolutely brilliant! The way all the hostages are all having' fun and enjoying themselves while Sonny and his friend are holding them 'hostage', yeah, they don't want to hurt any of the hostages, and they don't, they treat them very nice, they aren't really criminals, just people that sadly need a lot of money, and that is makes you feel for them and feel bad, they don't mean bad, but they need money, and that made me feel like it was realistic. And I LOVED the way all the towns people agreed with Sonny. The movie itself felt very real, I could imagine watching the news and seeing Al Pacino holding hostages, except the hostages weren't being tortured, they were having a decent time!

I thought both Al Pacino and John Cazale were perfectly casted together.  Pacino was a fantastic lead.  He convinced you the whole time that he was really this man Sonny.  Cazale might not have had as many lines as Pacino, but he none the less played his role nicely.  Dog Day Afternoon also takes some surprising turns that you would have never seen coming if you haven't heard of this incident before like me.  It took me completely off guard and really changed the whole mood of the film.  Dog Day Afternoon is another great film, helmed by Pacino and Cazale, that lives on suspense and drama.",

I did kind of wish it ended with a bit more impact, but it really was a very realistic, well thought out piece. Al Pacino never disappoints.",

The movie's great tension comes from the fact that even though it has a timespan of only few hours, the mood changes constantly as the exposure of the character's inner fears and needs gradually comes to fruition. Al Pacino is great as the clumsy, yet determined bank robber, who became sort of a celebrity through all his wrongdoings. While the robbery doesn't go as planned, Sonny slowly shows his true self, as his insatiate desire to become a star exceeds the urge to steal the money. Unfortunately, his friend Sam isn't as strong and charismatic. He starts to crack, and feels weaker and weaker every minute, and wants for this nightmare to end. And it ends, but not nearly as perfect as the boys imagined. A clever play on cliches, with an emphasis put on the society's reaction to a horrible event, which actually comes as more entertaining that harrowing in the final evaluation. An iconic movie, supported by electrifying performances by Al Pacino and John Cazale. A bank robbery that turned out to be a reality show for the masses. Intriguing.",
