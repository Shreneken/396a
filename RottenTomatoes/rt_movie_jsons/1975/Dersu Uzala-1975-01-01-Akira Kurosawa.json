Set in the forests of Eastern Siberia at the turn of the century, it is a portrait of the friendship that grows between an aging hunter and a Russian surveyor.

Performances here feel genuine, plus I enjoyed seeing the friendship grow more beautiful as the film progressed.  Visually, I loved seeing the various settings and locations this film takes its audiences through, all of which kept the film highly captivating.  It's a slow-paced film, but my engagement was always present due to the delightful and charming story and the gratifying finale. No wonder this film won the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film in 1976.",

This cozy atmosphere is leveraged by established master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa to tell a deeply emotional real life story about the strength of unconventional friendship in a harsh world as well as about how old age changes us all and how hard is to cope with it. This themes are obvious in this movie, yes, but this is not necessarily a bad thing, as it invokes sincerity and wise simplicity of Dersu himself. A tale about a man who became immortalized not because he was powerful or genius, but because he was a good friend. If you will not be bored by its expansive runtime, you will surely be touched by the story of a Nanai huntsman, a person of the kind that now may sadly be entirely gone from this world.",

            "content": "Featuring a friendship full of warmth, but capitalizing on the empty space between embraces and conversation, Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala touches on the return to an earlier way of living - one based on practicality, spirituality, and simplicity. Dersu is tremendously capable, only seen as simple through the lens of those that have become entrenched in society's trappings. He is simultaneously the victim of social changes in the world around him (the slow creep of civilization; his practical skills gradually fading from relevance) and a testament to the brutality of the way of life that he represents; once his eyes start to go, it is considered almost a death sentence. In that way, he's a multifaceted character, something of a 'noble victim' - embodying both the quiet harmony that is woefully missing from the modern world, and the mortal consequences that incentivized the changes. \n\nA critical aspect as to whether or not audiences will like Dersu Uzala is its structure, composed of many long, wordless takes intended to depict the sweeping and grand expanse of nature. It's vital to conveying Dersu as a character, getting a feel for the world that he not only lives in but seems to form a symbiotic relationship with; however, the scenes in the forest are not always wholly necessary, and you do eventually get a sense of redundancy as time goes on (though the bright colors and Kurosawa's clear affinity with the wilderness help to overcome that sensation). Still, when you get scenes as grand as the frozen lake, where Dersu and Arsenyev must frantically-but-near-wordlessly work for their lives as snow blows across the glittering ice, it makes much of the rest of the prodigious runtime feel a bit bland in comparison. (3.5/5)",

Inspired by real events, Dersu Uzala tells the story of early 1900s Russian military man and explorer Vladimir Arsenyev. In his travels through the merciless, yet mesmerizing Siberian taiga, he encounters the titular hunter, a local hunter whose family died and who is in complete and irreversible synchronization with nature.\n\nAs the two men travel together and perpetually help one another, a beautiful friendship blossoms between them, anchored by great mutual respect. However, their connection is so iconic and fascinating mainly because Dersu and the Captain never quite truly understand one another. The film charm also comes from the contradiction between its epic form and its intimate scope.\n\nThe aforementioned central relationship together with Kurosawa's magnificent naturalistic direction make up for one of the best and most memorable journey movies ever made, in spite of some prolonged sequences proving the same points again and again.",

            "content": "Dersu Uzala is a delightful film about a native man from Siberia who helps out a Russian Captain and his soldiers. The film is a powerful piece that looks at the difference between those who live on the land, and those who have grown up in more “civilized” society that are merely exploring the wilderness. It’s hard not to love the character of Dersu Uzala, because he is so smart and loaded with wisdom from a lifetime of living in these conditions. I thought Maksim Munzuk was wonderful at portraying this charming fellow, and showing his never-ending supply of energy. Yuriy Solomin was also great as the Russian officer who forms a bond with Dersu, and I loved watching the progression of their relationship. There were certainly moments of this film where it felt like the story was dragging a little, but most of the time I was fully invested because I cared about these characters. The final act was hard to watch because I could see what was coming, and I knew it wasn’t good news. I had real tears by the end of the movie, and that is always a sign that a movie has impacted me on a more profound emotional level. I’ve seen other films that emulate this same story, and in general it’s not typically the type of drama that connects with me in that way, but I think the titular character had garnered so much goodwill that I didn’t care if it felt like something I’ve seen before. Dersu Uzala is a long film that is even broken down into 2 separate acts, but I think it was well worth the time investment.",

            "content": "How fantastic is it that Kurosawa was a fan of Russian literature, and picked this obscure memoir to make a film out of when the Soviet production company Mosfilm approached him during a very difficult period in his life.  Somehow it seems appropriate, being so quiet and contemplative, and like a return to truth or oneâ(TM)s original self.  The story is fairly simple, relating the real-life adventures of an exploration into the rugged region around the Ussuri river basin when the groupâ(TM)s captain (Vladimir Arsenyev, played by Yury Solomin) befriends a mountain man (Dersu Uzala, played by Maxim Munzuk).  \n\nEarly on we see that Dersu identifies everything around him as a person â\" the sun, moon, wind, water, a tiger, etc.  It seems childlike, but itâ(TM)s actually rather profound - he sees a unity to everything, and that man is not separate from his environment.  He lives as one with nature, respects its power, doesnâ(TM)t waste, and helps others when he can.  As the captain says, âHe had a beautiful soul.  He provided for the needs of a person he didn't know, and probably wouldn't ever see.â?  He also recognizes subtle signs in things like tracks or weather conditions that others canâ(TM)t see.  The scene where he ingeniously builds a makeshift shelter out of tall grasses on the taiga when it gets late and the wind starts howling is excellent.  I donâ(TM)t know whether this character or movie helped shaped George Lucasâ(TM)s vision of Yoda, but there are certainly similarities.\n\nThe pace of the film is on the slow side, and that combined with minimal action may turn some viewers off, but I found that it went well with Dersuâ(TM)s spirit and the environment they were in.  âMan is very small before the face of nature,â? the film says, as Kurosawa gives us beautiful footage of wide open spaces, ice floes, and forests.  Let the simplicity wash over you and cleanse you, like Dersu undoubtedly did with Arsenyevâ(TM)s soul.  Itâ(TM)s not Kurosawaâ(TM)s very best, but this is a good one, and it got the 65-year-old director back on track to make more films at the end of his career.",

The character study of Dersu also is been executed through the observation and the interaction from Captain (viewers' proxy), who is enthralled by Dersu's simple yet ethereal nature, a rare bird may or may not be extinct now. The dual-acting from Munzuk and Solomin is the fruit of naturalistic emancipation and unassuming engagement. \n \nAlso a memorable presence is Isaak Shvarts's accompanying score segues from lithe to menacing, eerie to sonorous, with Russian folklore and shanty as well.\n\nBeing a Chinese, I cannot avoid mentioning the sensitive timing (after China and Japan's rapprochement in 1972 and China and Soviet Union's dispute in 1969) of the film-making, which prompted an accusation from Chinese government concerns a so-called political libel on Chinese people, mainly by vilifying Hunhutsi (which literally means red beard in Mandarin) as the villain and the nature-balance defier. But honestly, this episode is largely overstated since there is no direct confrontation at all in the film, at least for my compatriots, don't let this smokescreen blinds your eyes, DERSU UZALA is a spirited ethnological oeuvre could inspire whoever has a chance to watch it, preferably on a big screen or at least a BluRay edition.",

Inizialmente visto come un rozzo ed eccentrico vecchio, Dersu guadagna il rispetto dei soldati grazie alla sua grande intelligenza, il suo istinto, l'acuto senso di osservazione e la sua profonda umanità. Dersu Uzala salva le vite del Capitano Arseniev e di uno dei suoi uomini per ben due volte. Fra i due nasce una grande amicizia.\n\nCinque anni dopo nel 1907, i due amici si incontrano di nuovo nella foresta. Dersu si unirà nuovamente al drappello ed alla fine della spedizione lascerà i soldati presso i binari della ferrovia e ritornerà nuovamente nella foresta, ma qualche anno dopo incontrerà nuovamente Arseniev in un'altra spedizione. In quest'ultimo periodo Dersu è invecchiato, ma soprattutto è diventato miope e non riesce più a centrare le sue prede e perciò non è più capace di cacciare. Arseniev, preoccupato che non riesca più a sopravvivere nella foresta, lo porta a casa sua, nella città di Chabarovsk, dove risiede con la sua famiglia. Dersu ben presto si rende conto che non può adattarsi alla vita della città, perciò un giorno chiede al capitano che lo lasci libero di abbandonare la città e di tornare nella foresta. Così l'amico decide di lasciarlo andare dopo avergli regalato un bellissimo fucile, con un mirino potente che possa aiutarlo a vedere coi suoi deboli occhi.\n\nQualche tempo dopo, Arseniev riceve un telegramma che lo informa del ritrovamento del corpo di un Hezhen non identificato, che tuttavia aveva con sé il suo biglietto da visita e viene invitato ad identificare il corpo. Arseniev riconosce il corpo e dichiara alla polizia che si trattava di \"Dersu Uzala, cacciatore\". Un poliziotto gli fa notare che non era stata trovata nessun'arma da caccia vicino al corpo: Dersu era stato ucciso per rubargli il fucile, che Arseniev gli aveva regalato al momento del loro congedo.\n[it.wikipedia.org]",

The results are mixed in my opinion, but it gave Kurosawa a much needed boost that allowed him to go on to make a final few masterpieces in the twilight of his career.\n\nThere isn't much of a plot.  Really only vignettes of this man born and raised in the wilderness guiding Russian surveyors in the wilderness and how his view of life differs from his companions.  For 2.5 hours, a philosophical back and forth isn't all that compelling (had to finish this in two sittings).  The tragic end of the story picks up a lot more though and gives a suitably reverent and appropriate closing to the story.\n\nAlthough this was filmed in 70mm and Kurosawa's second color picture, the transfer on the DVD is terrible and doesn't do the sweeping landscapes and forests any justice.  This needs a blu-ray transfer badly, but I doubt it will get one even though Kurosawa won an Oscar for it.\n\nIt's not a feature that gets mentioned very often in Kurosawa's oeuvre and honestly...I can see why.  Not that it's bad, just nowhere near as compelling as his other films.  Probably only recommended to Kurosawa completists.",

Set in the early 1900's in the Russian wilderness I believe, the film follows a captain and his men who are sent into the wilderness to accurately map out the land. They come across Dersu Uzala early in their travels; a wise, compassionate Mongolian man of the wilderness who's humanity is incomparable. The captain and Dersu form a loving friendship, and eventually part ways. Three years later, the captain sent on a similar expedition in the same region, accompanied by more soldiers, eventually finds Dersu roaming the wilderness once again. Dersu develops a horrible paranoia because of shooting a tiger, and discovers his eyesight is giving way. So the captain takes him into his home and town, where Dersu feels constricted and sticks out like a sore thumb. He finally decides his place is in the wilderness, where man truly belongs, and the ending is powerful in its cynicism of our now common society structure. The cinematography is particularly amazing, along with the performances and direction. The movie's pretty slow, so if you don't like slow films in the wilderness it's not up your alley. I've had to write this really fast because I have to leave in a minute so it's probably not incredibly coherent but my main point: don't pass this film up. Very powerful stuff.",

The long periods of quiet, where owls and the crackle of campfires occupy the cutting nights and empty days on the tundra, only serve to accentuate the edges of their friendship, an experience which might only come from that unique immensity which comes from being lost in the woods.

            "content": "Roger Corman Presents, for Some Reason  \r\n\r\nThe history of this film seems a little complicated.  For one thing, while it did indeed win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 1975, it beat the Japanese film in doing so.  Kurosawa it may be; it was still considered an entry from the Soviet Union.  Of course, it's very clearly a Russian story.  These men are tramping around Siberia, after all.  And, of course, the Kino Video release of it comes with the original US theatrical trailer, which features the prominent words \"Roger Corman Presents.\"  If you could choose the two names in all of the film industry to join together in a film, would you choose Roger Corman and Akira Kurosawa?  It is astonishingly improbable.  A Kurosawa film winning an Oscar for the Soviet Union is astonishingly improbable.  Nothing about this movie's background is what would be expected--frankly, a Kurosawa film winning an Oscar is kind of improbable, if you look at the man's record.  Start naming Kurosawa films, and a lot of them haven't even gotten nominated.  [i]Rashomon[/i] won an honorary award, and that's about it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomin) is leading an expedition into darkest Siberia to map out the land of the Czar.  (The Czar is not mentioned, of course, because Soviet.)  They acquire a native guide named, well, Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk).  He is of one of those Mongolian/Siberian/Chinese ethnic groups of which outsiders--read Americans--have never heard, and he has lived in those hills his entire life.  Dersu saves Captain Aresniev's life.  They bond.  When Captain Arseniev comes through a few years later for basically the same purpose, he and the men with him who were in the previous expedition talk longingly about how they wish Dersu were with them, and then of course he shows up. There is more bonding, some more life-saving, and then Dersu does something which, according to his beliefs, means he's essentially doomed.  He freaks out, and it may bring him the doom he believes just in a psychosomatic way.\r\n\r\nThe movie kind of fails itself in the third act, most of which seems unnecessary.  We get it--Arseniev and Dersu are from different worlds, and neither of them can ever belong in the other's.  It doesn't need to be spelled out quite so clearly.  It turns out the story's autobiographical, and I do think we need the ending where it is, but I'm not sure we need to get there the way we do.  I suspect Arseniev's book (his name is spelled \"Arsenyev\" when listing him as the author, and his son, played by Dmitri Korshikov, is listed as \"son of Arsenjev\") goes through the same process, and it's possible that the Soviet money people felt that the story needed to be told as is to show some point about Soviet resistance of the decadent Czarist state or something.  Certainly Kurosawa is not the only screenwriter listed, probably because his Russian wasn't up to the task, but there may well have been Party interference which he needed to work around.  Or I could be making excuses.\r\n\r\nThe film is, of course, beautiful as Kurosawa is beautiful.  The vast wastelands of Siberia are rendered almost crystalline in places, pure and untouched.  For most of the film, basically what we have is Arseniev and Dersu slogging about, frequently followed by Areseniev's men, though not always, doing the whole surveying thing.  Dersu is some sort of exotic figure, tracker and shaman in one.  He tells stories of oneness with the Earth, the River, the Wind.  In some ways, I think he may be an idealized Soviet.  Again, he avoids the decadence of the city.  He is the Defender of the Innocent, even leading the surveyors after bandits who have killed men and kidnapped women, and it is only when others from the area show that they can take care of the situation that he and the soldier/surveyors go back to work.  There is their job, and there are the men who will protect the women, and it is all a product of the greater good of the people.\r\n\r\nFrankly, the men seem to think of Dersu as more of a mascot than a man.  There are a series of photos taken midway through the movie, and a lot of them are basically the kind of pictures you'd take with a child.  Dersu wearing the captain's hat.  Dersu posed on a horse.  Dersu with the surveying equipment.  Pretending to use it, even.  Toward the end of the third act, he is essentially infantilized.  It almost feels like a fish-out-of-water sitcom, [i]My Favorite Hunter[/i] or something.  For all he is the title character and clearly someone Arseniev remembers with fondness, fondness is kind of a deprecating word.  Okay, probably he respects Dersu's abilities in his steppe life, but Arseniev treats Dersu's spirituality as a kind of childishness.  Which, to be fair to him and the film, is how the Soviet structure looked at most belief systems which were not actually belief in the Soviet state and way of life.  Still, that doesn't mean that the film is better for doing the same thing.",

            "content": "Dersu Uzala was Japanese master Akira Kurosawa's first and only production in Russian, it was also the first Russian/Japanese co-production. Co-written and directed by the master, Dersu Uzala follows a topographic expedition troop that is led by Captain Arseniev, played by Yuri Solomin, that encounters a nomadic Nanai tribesman named Dersu Uzala, played by Macim Munzuk, who agrees to guide the men through the harsh wilderness. He is initially viewed by the men as uneducated, eccentric old man but Dersu eventually earns the respect of the men through his intelligence, great instincts and his power of observation. They watch him as he repairs an abandoned hut where he leaves provisions in a container so that a future traveler would be able to survive there. He is able to deduce the identities and situations of people by analyzing their tracks and whatever articles they leave behind. During their time together Dersu saves the lives of Captain Arseniev and his men not once, but twice. The first time is when a sudden blizzard overtakes Dersu and the Captain, Dersu shows the Captain how to quickly build a straw hut for shelter using the tundra grass. By building this hut the two men were able to avoid freezing to death and are soon discovered by the other two men when the blizzard had cleared in the morning. Five years later in 1907, Dersu and the Captain are once again together in the wilderness. While fording a river with a raft, Dersu and the Captain fall into swift moving currents and Dersu forces the Captain to swim across while the raft is close to the shore and then directs the men to cut a tree down which can reach him before he drowns. As the expedition comes to a close, he leaves the men by the railroad tracks and returns back into the wilderness. Years later the Captain encounters Dersu once more on another surveying expedition. On this expedition it is discovered that Dersu's eyesight has begun to fade away with age. He is no longer able to hunt and the Siberian tiger that has been stalking the old man comes very close to Dersu until he shoots at the animal. The Captain asks Dersu once more if he would much rather go back to the city of Khabarovsk with him and so Dersu agrees as he is unable to truly live in the wilderness anymore. During the year that he lives with the Captain, Dersu discovers that he is not permitted to chop wood or build a hut or fireplace in the city park, nor is he allowed to shoot his rifle within the city limits. One day Dersu asks to leave the city and return to living in the hills as he is not fit to really live in such a closed off environment. As a parting gift, the Captain gives him a new rifle, once that he says will not miss even if you can't aim right. Sometime later, the Captain receives a telegram informing him that the body of a Goldi had been found. Because the body had no identification on him save for the Captain's calling card, he is requested to go and identify the body. When he arrives, he identifies that it is indeed the body of Dersu. The officer speculates that he may have been killed by someone to obtain the new rifle the Captain had given him. The film ends with a shot of the unmarked grave where the men bury Dersu.\n\nThe production of Dersu Uzala came in a time that was very rough on Kurosawa as he was constantly having trouble being able to find ways to finance his projects despite his previous successes and his last film, Dodes'ka-den, became a critical and financial flop in Japan yet still earned an Oscar nomination for the year of 1970. With the failure of Dodes'ka-den, Kurosawa became deeply depressed and eventually attempted to commit suicide by slashing himself with a razor over 30 times, yet was able to survive. But it wouldn't be until 5 years later that he would return to filmmaking with the Oscar winning Dersu Uzala.\n\nThe film is based on the 1923 memoir Dersu Uzala by Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev, about his exploration of the Sikhote-Alin  region of Siberia over the course of multiple expeditions in the early 20th century. He co-wrote it with Russian screenwriter Yuri Nagibin based off of the aforementioned memoirs. As with all of Kurosawa's films, each shot is carefully composed to form a dramatic picture. It explores the themes such as man vs. nature as well as the \"old ways\" vs the \"new ways\" of living through progress. It centers on two men who grow an extremely close bond with each other. Both men are from very different backgrounds yet they are able to gain respect for one another and become very close. It is almost entirely shot in the rugged Siberian wilderness and each shot is breathtakingly beautiful. The bond between the two characters and the actors that portray them is just beautiful to watch. The struggles with the wilderness that they go through together makes this such a moving film. Yet another great film from the master of Japanese cinema that proves he was not only the master of Japan but probably the world. Must see for Kurosawa fans! 9/10",

            "content": "\"How can man live in a box?\" This question, which lies at the heart of the masterpiece that is Akira Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala, is voiced by the titular character in the final act of the film. The question, of course, refers to a house, which to Dersu would seem like nothing more than a box. A house to him is like a coffin to us. Kurosawa, who was in exile from Japan when he made Dersu Uzala in Russia in 1975, made the film to not only express his own feelings of estrangement, and loss, but also to ruminate on a theme that has been a part of art since the dawn of, well, art: the conflict between nature and civilization. Dersu, the rugged Goldi man who lives in the forests of a part of Russia (at the turn of the 20th century) not specified, is somewhat of a Tarzan, but by choice. He lives as hunter-gatherer, with only his clothes, his gun, and an incredible knowledge of the forest. Dersu's world, however, is shrinking, and one of the great ironies of the film is that he becomes, by chance, the guide for a group of military surveyors, mapping the region surely for development. The trancendance of the film comes in the relationship between Dersu and the captain of this unit, Captain Arseniev. It is a meaningful, and moving  relationship between two men who should be enemies, and is always colored with a sort of meloncholy that Dersu, his way of life, and his home (which we would not define as a home) will soon be gone. We never exactly  see the forest destroyed, but there is never any doubt that this destruction is coming. Captain Arseniev, at the opening of the film, searches for Dersu's grave, but he cannot find it becuase the trees marking it have been cut down. The simplicity of their relationship is profound, as well as its complx implications. Both men are highly knowledgeable, and highly imperfect. Their humanity is one of the films greatest triumphs. Earlier in this review  I called Dersu Uzala a masterpiece. It is, but saying that of a Kurosawa film is rather redundant. His brilliance as a director has produced masterpieces into the double digits. This films showcases his talent as well as any other film of his, and should be seen by anyone who claims to love Kurosawa, and film in general. It is pretty damn near perfect.",

One of Akira Kurosawa's less recognized films, most likely due to its Russian production.  It's quite a shame really, as this film is one of his best.  The story is so simple, and yet on the genius of Kurosawa could pull it off so well.  He really makes the audience connect with the characters, and brings the splendor of Siberia to life.  My connection to the characters was perhaps the strongest of any film I have seen.  The scene when the two main characters reunite after four years was incredible.  Their happiness was so real, and I felt it just as they did.  And when Dersu became nearsighted and was forced to live in the city, I really felt his sadness.  Akira Kurosawa is beyond genius, and this film is just as brilliant as he is.  Undoubtably one of the greatest films I have ever seen.",

            "content": "1902: Arseniev (Yuri Solomin), a czarist officer and his men exploit and map the Usuri-region. The gigantic pine-forests of the Taiga evoke visions of the Walpurgis-night. Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk) sits down at their camp-fire and smokes his pipe. The old man who lost his wife and children during a smallpox epidemic lives in the mountains without permanent refuge and hunts the stag, the wild boar, the sable. He benefits from the nature but does not exhaust it. As a matter of course he takes the lead of the expedition, shows them how to cover a roof with bark and instructs them to leave stock - rice, salt, matches - for other travelers. They learn not to squander cartridges and that an empty bottle is valuable in the wilderness. They wade through the morass and suddenly the winter sets in.\n\nArseniev and Dersu lose their way on the ice-covered lake Hanka and the snow-drift covers their footprints. Their race against time is perhaps the most breathtaking scene in the film: the men cut as many blades of grass as possible in order to survive the cold night. Arseniev realizes how small man is in front of the big nature. He invites Dersu to join him (\"It' comfortable in the city\") but he prefers his free life. He sees the men off to the train station and they agree: \" He is such a good man!\".\n\n1907, spring, snow-break: Arseniev explores the Usuri-region again. Three months later a vast territory has been mapped, but the task would be carried through quicker with Dersu's help. Arseniev looks out for his old friend: Dersu made much money with furs but a trader disappeared with his savings.\n\nThe Taiga in summer is a jungle. \"Amdar\" (the tiger) follows them. They discover pitfalls with carrion; Dersu is shocked over their needless death. He is at war with the Chunchuse who abduct women. Arseniev helps him save three of their victims who were nearly drowning, but Dersu falls in a torrential river and the rescue-operation is another absorbing (and ingenious) moment in the film.\n\nThe turning point in Dersu's life comes when he inadvertently kills the tiger. He becomes nervous and irritable and fears that the spirit \"Kangar\" will punish him. His vision becomes defective; he misses his game. \"How can I live in the Taiga?\". Arseniev invites him to Chaberowsk: \"My house is your house\". His wife welcomes Dersu in their house and his little son worships him, but Dersu cannot manage life in the city where water and wood cost money; He is arrested when he tries to fell a tree...He feels redundant and decides to return to the mountains. Arseniev understands his request and gives him a brand-new gun as farewell-present. A few days later he is forced to identify his old friend's body: Somebody killed Dersu - for his gun.\n\nDERSU UZALA needs no recommendation: it won best foreign film in 1975 and every fan of Akira Kurosawa will see it sooner or later. Central Asia, this gigantic territory is awe-inspiring in itself (and bear in mind that there is no wilderness in Japan where nearly every tree has been cultivated for aesthetic reasons) and the cinematography is overwhelming - I regret that I have not seen the film on the big screen. What impressed me most was the high-mindedness of the performances. There is not one patronizing undertone. Deep respect for those people who live in, of, and most importantly, with the nature pervades this film.",

            "content": "An improbable film to be sure, Dersu Uzala is a Kurosawa film made as a joint Russian-Japanese venture. Made during the Cold War in the Soviet Union, Dersu Uzala follows a group of Russian army engineers led by Captain Arseniev sent to survey Siberia. They employ a local trapper, Dersu Uzala, as a guide. Initially, the relationship between the engineers and Dersu is only a working relationship. They see Uzala's practical backwoods wisdom as quaint and outdated. However, after Dersu's knowledge saves the lives of the party, they come to respect him. Arseniev in particular form a close bond with Dersu, inviting him into his home in the city after old age begins to take its toll on the trapper.\n\nAs usual, when Kurosawa takes a great story and retells it, the result is excellent. Made during an extremely dark time in Kurosawa's life, Dersu Uzala shows the needs for friendship and having a life one is at peace with. In the style of Kurosawa and other Japanese films of the time, the emotion and interplay between characters can be very subtle by Western standards, but that is their way. As with other Russian films, the pacing can be slow, but that is their way. The two cultures share common ground in unshakable stoicism when faced with a tragic inescapable situation, and Dersu and Arseniev do with decorum what they feel must be done. The Siberian wilderness serves as a beautiful stage for the whole performance.",
