When the mythical king of the Britons leads his knights on a quest for the Holy Grail, they face a wide array of horrors, including a persistent Black Knight, a three-headed giant, a cadre of shrubbery-challenged knights, the perilous Castle Anthrax, a killer rabbit, a house of virgins, and a handful of rude Frenchmen.",

What follows is an episodic journey that includes a battle with the Rabbit of Caerbannog, a game of wits at the Bridge of Death, a couple of confrontations with surly French soldiers (‘I fart in your general direction!!'), and much more.  While the animation that was so effective in the Flying Circus TV show as a transition tool between segments feels like an unnecessary distraction in the Holy Grail, there are enough iconic lines and scenes to make the movie worth watching…and probably more than once.",

And I loved it, I don't think it is quite as good as Life of Brian, but it is definitely one of the better Monty Python comedies for sheer hilarity and fun. The story like Life of Brian isn't the strongest component but this is in no way a criticism and yes the special effects are cheesy but perhaps that was the intention. My only problem with the film was that the ending is a little flat, but that is a minor criticism compared to how much I loved this film. The script is irreverent and highly quotable, and the soundtrack is even funnier. As a comedy it is wonderfully inventive, that debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry through King Arthur, The Black Knight, God and the \"knights who say ni\". Comedy highlights include the trial with Connie Booth's witch and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch sequence. Even the sets are quite well designed and authentic. And the acting is simply wonderful, John Cleese, Terry Jones(the encounter with Dennis's mother was hilarious), Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle perfectly live up to their exceptional talents. Overall, a great comedy and a great film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",

It is indeed quite a shock when the modern world comes to interrupt everything in the end.\n\nAs for the story itself, it is meandering and uneven, but sometimes can be very funny. The Black Knight who still won't give up after losing all his limbs, Sir Robin the not-so-brave, the effeminate son of a tough lord, the three questions at the bridge, Castle Anthrax, and so on.

One could also look at it as a high budget LARPing event. \n\nAll the fine Blokes and Lasses performed wonderfully, particularly John Cleese as several characters and Graham Chapman as King Arthur. \n\nThe Knights who say Ni were truly a special bunch that had me in stitches. Also, I could never get over the horse riding gag.  \n\nNi. Ni. Ni. \n\nI'd definitely recommend it if one is looking for a good laugh.

Coming right off their television show; Flying circus, Holy Grail was conceived and directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilham, as their first film in the trilogy ( we don't talk about \" And Now for Something Completely Different\" ). For a budget of only £229,000, the film doesn't feel cheap or cut back by any budget restraints, and instead fit inside of the joke, like the coconut gag, they couldn't afford horses so built around the lack of budget to create an entertaining and wacky film. The first viewing of this film left me roaring in laughter, rolling off my seat even before the beginning credits had even finished, I had never experienced that amount of laughter before watching this film and still remains a fond memory. The film has a legendary cult following, not surprising since the film is a joy to watch on repeat. Everything about it is great, from the classic cinematography of a Monty Python sketch, to the acting from John Cleese and the rest of the Python gang. This FEELS like the ultimate Monty Python sketch, taking such a... well... DARK AGE ( Little pun for you there), and creating comedy gold. From the 4th wall breaking to the sudden and surprising musical songs, Monty Python has gone all out with this film. The only thing that I could say that could ( for some people), let the film down would be its ending. It is a very British film so if you are not a fan of British humour, you might be a tad disappointed with the ending, however as a brit, the ending for me is bloody brilliant. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a must see for all film lovers and everyone else in the universe, I highly recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humour.",

It's always good to casually watch a good old Mockumentary and this film has many memorable one liners and scenes that certainly left me satisfied. The narrative is a mess, mean that in a good way, but it's meant to be that way and the film has become a classic for a reason. The Pythons are a brilliant group and I will enjoy watching there many other films. Yes it was slightly boring at times and this probably isn't one of my favourite films but I do appreciate it.\n\nQuote - 'We are now the Knights who say...\"Ekki-ekki-ekki-ekki-PTANG.

            "content": "The perfect surrealist comedy!\n\nTerry Gilliam and Terry Jones' absurdist comedy Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) is a classic comedy film wherein nothing makes sense and everything is silly. Monty Python spoof Arthurian Legend by having King Arthur search for the Holy Grail, as commissioned by God, through a series of silly surrealist sketches like Monty Python's television show Flying Circus. It's a fun premise, dealt with an absurdist's irreverence for such a holy subject matter. Monty Python kills you with every blood gag, launched animal, verbose taunt, or sly jab. Absolutely worthing watching still as it holds up tremendously.\n\n The loose feel keeps things light, but Monty Python's writing has never been so tightly wound by quick setups to stellar payoffs. I love the police appearances leading into the copout ending or the French knight saying he already had a grail. Monty Python's genius writing with mature knowledge and childish humor blend well for any number of joke bits on the black knight, Arthur's Knights of the Round Table, Camelot, and castle sieges. Every single line of this movie is quotable, I guarantee it!\n\nGilliam and Jones make great use of their smaller budget with coconuts for horses, mini models for castles, and natural Scottish backdrops for easy Medieval sets. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is seriously one of the funniest films ever made. Hazel Pethig's costumes look like Medieval Times outfits; they are so campy. Monty Python appears like they just walked off a stage play performance onto the silver screen. Pam Luke's make-up is clever enough to disguise many Monty Python members as elderly men, ugly women, and enchanters.\n\nGilliam's interlude animations feel refreshing and funny with cutouts of magazines and paintings moving around with strange voices for a ridiculous amount of fun. John Hackney's editing splices together wild imagery and goofy sequences into a quickly paced comedy that only lasts 91 minutes and feels like 30. Terry Bedford's cinematography is excellent with beautiful wide shots all around Scotland and hilarious close-ups of characters in the backdrop or a key figure making a funny face out of nowhere.\n\nGraham Chapman is super funny as the ultra serious as King Arthur on his sacred quest. John Cleese is hilarious as a quiping French knight, an intense enchanter, the overly eager Sir Lancelot, and the indignant Black Knight. Terry Jones is great as the not so scientific Sir Bedevere. Michael Palin is hilarious as the outrageous anti-monarchist Dennis as well as the chaste Sir Galahad. Eric Idle is a riot as the Dead Collector, the cowardly Sir Robin, and pretty much every supporting role. Terry Gilliam is fun as Patsy with his coconut horse, Green Knight, and the Old Man from Scene 24.\n\nI must mention the adorable Connie Booth is so cute and sympathetic as \"The Witch.\" Carol Cleveland is so silly and desperate as Zoot and Dingo. Neil Innes, the thoughtful composer, is also funny as the First Monk and the Singing Minstrel. Monty Python and the Holy Grail's cast is simply sublime! This is cinematic comedy bliss!\n\nIn conclusion, I always laugh during every scene. How can you not like this pleasantly clever movie?",

You wouldn't watch this for its coherence or cinematography or certainly special effects (although even that gets some self referential laughs).  While much of the film is so absurd it is borderline stupid and the limited physical humor isn't anything special, there are at times very funny sharp-witted verbal exchanges, which makes for some eminently quotable lines - lines I will remember long after I can recall any Tarantino film.

Well, then you have Monty Python and the Holy Grail right after the TV show which I haven't watched before Monty Python's Flying Circus. Now Monty Python is something that I can't stop laughing and all the stuff that happens is really really hilarious and it never stops. It has six comedian actors, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. All six of them are funny. Arthur, King of the Britons is on the journey to search for men to join the Knights of the Round Table but God is here to give him and the knights the task to search for the Holy Grail. And that's it. The rest is all silly hilarious moments with all six actors making the audience laugh. Now I can get the absolute funny stuff that has been going on. When you have got the DVD you see that you are watching a B&W film callled Dentists on the Job and all of the sudden somebody change the film saying that it's not the right bloody film so he put Monty Python and the Holy Grail for you guys. The opening credits is something that I have with it. I've been laughing at it for stopping the credits saying \"We apologise for the fault in the subtitles. Those responsible have been sacked.\" and they stopped the credits again because somebody put subtitles on again saying \"We apologise again for the fault in the subtitles. Those responsible for sacking the people who have just been sacked, have been sacked.\" and then they stopped the credits AGAIN cause the directors of the film (it's not firm, it's film) hired to continue the credits after the other people had been sacked, wish it to be known that they have just been sacked. Then it says the credits have been completed in an entirely different style at great expense and at the last minute and boom and it ends. There's one song that I love is a song called Knights of the Round Table where they ride to Camelot! I did find the animated dragon funny where he chases the knights and it disappeared because the animator suffered a fatal heart attack. Now the way the knights ride their horses are not horses, they use coconuts for horse steps and they pretending to ride a horse. That's funny. The ending is not what I expecting but I won't spoil it. Now what can I say about Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Well, I absolutely loved it. I can watch this film for days and not get tired of it like Life of Brian which I'm gonna do next. I love Fawlty Towers and Blackadder too. And Mr Bean. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of my favourite films of all time and my favourite British comedy of all time and it's a fantastic film filled with funny aspects and with it's King Arthur story too bad they didn't show Merlin in it but when I thought of it, Arthur pulled the sword from the stone and becomes king. As long as people love silly comedies, Monty Python's Life of Brian will be next in my review so stay tuned for that.",

            "content": "\"Monty Python\" makes it clear that the highlight will always be the joke, the laughter, and never the vanity of who is or is not able to make a laugh, and by such dedication and generosity we already have a good reason to follow this story.\n\nThe philosopher Henri Bergson devoted much of his studies on comedy, as we can see in his book (RISO - TEST ON THE MEANING OF THE COMIC). In this work, which breaks down the foundation of laughter, Bergson points to an idea in which the English comedy group \"Monty Python\" uses it almost as a thesis, in the case: Laughter is the mechanics applied to the living being.\n\nIn \"Monty Python & the Holy Grail\" (1975), we have all the distribution of a mechanics applied subtly, without didatisms or presented in a mandatory way in order to provoke the amusement of the public, although it is a comedy, it is not performed Openly as conventionally other films of the genre are proposed, something that can be verified in the film \"The Meaning of Life\", later work of that same group, that uses of \"sketches\", something simplistic and shallow in the construction of comicidad, mainly if we consider The complexity of the comic effect employed in a feature film with focal and linear history.\n\nThe comedy whose main satire focus is on the legend of King Arthur, is a work written and performed by the group Monty Python and which was directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones. The satire employed expands its limits by showing a king on a sacred mission, and who, because he is a believer of his condition, provokes laughter by having this severity interrupted by riding on an imaginary animal which exists only through the beating of a coconut, A sound effect entrusted to his helper Patsy (Terry Gilliam), the sonority is enough for King Arthur of the Bretons (Graham Chapman) to believe to possess a horse that accompanies him through the English lands. This effect not only of the sound, but of a king almost in the mold of the Danish tale \"The new clothes of the king\", where a noble parades naked, but believing to dress a beautiful clothes, therefore, his tailor told him, in King Arthur's crazy, imaginative stance added to the sound of the coconuts will be calculations resulting from a recurring mechanical summation in the film, something Bergson identifies as the mechanics of repetition for laughter.\n\n\"Repeat, a combination of circumstances repeated exactly on several occasions, in stark contrast to the changing course of life - the more comic the repetition (or coincidence) the more complex the repeated scene is and the more natural it is represented (two Conditions - complexity and naturalness that seem to be excluded, and which the ability of the theatrical author should reconcile) \". Bergson, 1900.\n\nThe highlight of this characteristic repetition in \"Monty Python & the Holy Grail\" is the sophistication in which it is built, and in the moments when it is inserted, therefore, it is something that runs the risk of being tiring or beaten but that in the movie exercises A charm to the point of wanting more. The same effect occurs in all circumstances in which King Arthur and his companions attempt to invade castles, but never succeed. Since the attempts, these different, always fail, even when they prove to be an excellent idea, as in the attempt to mold the Trojan horse, which in the film is replaced by a large wooden rabbit handed over to the French.\n\nAn interesting division made to know each of the Knights of the Round Table in detail is a break with the Brecht theatrical model, a break with the fictional narrative, presenting a historian (current to the period in which the work was performed), and Of a television program, explains or tries to explain what happened to the knights, but a tragicomic outcome is given to the teacher, this unused break for free, gains permanent prominence as we feed back the plot of the film, evoking moments of Laughs through the repetition of interruptions of medieval history by a modern police investigation.\n\nWith the break that allows us to know better figures such as the intelligent Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), the brave Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), the chaste Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), and Sir Robin (Eric Idle), the public is graced with performances Clean. We have in each actor a precise \"time\" for laughter and a game of stairs between the \"Python\" group making it clear that the highlight will always be the joke, never the vanity of who is or is not able to make a laugh, and for such a delivery And generosity we already have a good reason to watch them.\n\nDirection and photography make primary recording slips, in some scenes, for example, there is lens blur, and the use of open planes can not always communicate the size of what one wants to reveal, perhaps this occurs for a budget limit , Since many of the plains scenes are flattened in medium planes that do not account for registering castles and settlements (something that needs investments for construction), already in the dark scenes or of mists, the use of close's, big close's and open plans , Rather than assisting in any dialogue, only complicates and diminishes the intended comic effect.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the moments of insertion of the animations are all very well inserted, besides the impeccable art that collaborates and helps in the construction of a comic proposal, and even being drawings inserted in a human history, are used naturally. As Bergson explains, this occurs when a certain comic effect derives from a certain cause, the more natural we are to judge, the greater the comic effect will seem to us: we already laugh at the deviation which appears to us as a simple fact. More risible will be the deviation that we see arise and increase before us, whose origin we know and whose history we can reconstitute. The cause of the insertion of these drawings into the film are always the results of a world and a divine order, which leave the terrestrial plane and present themselves as the world of the human extra-plane, and are recorded just like the illustrations of the catholic church in the middle ages , However, without the seriousness of the trait of the church, but always of the comic trait.\n\nFinally, I emphasize that by appropriating a medieval history, the British group arguably knew how to deal with social significance, creating a timeless work. The plot is strengthened by the idea of ??a group laugh, for we would not enjoy the comic if we felt isolated - laughter seems to need echo, complicity with other jokers, real or imaginary, something the Pythons know well.",

Rather than being a film in its own right, it is more a collection of stand-alone sketches and vignettes.  Whilst this doesn't make the film bad, I think it can be confusing for first-time viewers.

That being said, it can be safely said that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy for virtually everyone. It is even a good experience for children since there is really only one suggestive scene and it is very brief.\n\nNearly every scene in this film is comic gold and very quotable. Who can forget the black night remarking \"'tis but a flesh wound,\" the holy hand grenade, or even the opening scene (are you suggesting coconuts migrate)? Even great historical allusions are made for humor, such as a reference to the idea of the Trojan horse.\n\nThe film also has a great sense of self-awareness and is very meta. The narrator comments on the animator at one point, a woman dressed in white refers to the script of the film, and the characters refer to specific scenes from earlier in the film. This is all in good fun and its self-awareness is primarily meant to add to the humor rather than commenting on art in general which more \"serious\" meta texts tend to do.\n\nHowever, this is a strange film when you take into account that from time to time in the film historians appear to briefly comment on the time period and are disregarded the next second as well as other people that are clearly not from the medieval time period becoming involved in the film. This aspect causes the film to end very strangely and abruptly. Monty Python and the Holy Grail would be stronger if it had a more definitive conclusion than the one it does.\n\nFilled with comedic gold, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a very enjoyable experience.\n\n3.5/4.0",

So for watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail for a third time for review reasons, it's still a hilarious film that has moments that I forgot were in there. The characters are very likable and memorable. The writing is comedic genius and that it got people quoting a lot from this movie. It's really interesting that they put in some history events in there, but make it exaggerated which would make it really funny. There are going to be some funny moments that you completely forgot and might find them funny because there are just way too many memorable moments in it.

There is a basic plot but that's all you would really find as the film is littered with segments that are just there for the jokes and nothing more. This is what you are watching it for as there are some really well written and funny lines found.\nThose familiar with Monty Python will already know what to expect, with all the cast on hand with their multiple characters. Many of the jokes here will already be familiar with anyone who has not seen the film as they are often featured elsewhere, including the coconuts for horses and the famous black knight losing his limbs.\nOther than the verbal jokes, there are also some clever little visual techniques on show such as the film burning and joke subtitles. I won't describe them as it ruins the jokes, but I thought the beginning and end of the movie were some of the best jokes in the film.\nIt's hard to rate a film as it will come across different to everybody who watches it. Is it a well made film? Not particularly but that's not the purpose of it. As long as your happy watching classic British humour with no serious story, then you will love it.",

This movie that features became a cult classic and is ranked as one of the best comedy films ever. The film brings a mixture between British hilarity and ridicule. I must say not all viewers will love it. The storyline is about King Arthur and his knights on their quest to find the Holy Grail. Scenes with the coconut-horse-sounds, the battle with the black knight, the Knights who say Ni and the Rabbit of Caerbannog are unforgettable. Three other films were made: Life of Brian, And Now Something Completely Different and The Meaning of Life. \n\nKing Arthur (Chapman) and his squire Patsy (Gilliam) are travelling around the country to recruit brave men to join them on a dangerous quest.  Knights Sir Bevedere the Wise (Jones), Sir Lancelot the Brave (Cleese), Sir Robin the-Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Lancelot (Idle) and Sir Galahad the Pure (Palin) join their party. The men are approached by God who asks them to seek the Holy Grail. On their way they come across many dangers: a French-occupied castle, a wedding party, a three-headed Giant and the Rabbit of Caerbannog. Will they succeed?",

I noticed that the movie is really cheap and that's what makes it so funny like that scene when are main characters are getting chase by a big monster and the narrator said \"So are heroes are getting chase by the beast but suddenly the animator died of a heart attack\" and then it showed you the guy who doing the animation of the beast fell on the floor dead.",

The laughs are endless and unstoppable, from the uproarious opening credits to the abrupt and incredibly silly ending. The poor production values and cheap look only make the film funnier; it is widely known the budget was so low the actors couldn't ride real horses, and the ending was supposed to be entirely different, but there was not enough time and money to execute it. Along with The Big Lebowski, The Holy Grail is the all-time comedy classic, one of the greatest films of all time, and a film that is always equally funny, whether you're watching it drunk, sober, alone or in company.",

Each of the main members of Monty Python depict several characters, with Graham Chapman depicting King Arthur, who leads a group of knights to find the Holy Grail, a quest that has been given to him by God. The best way to describe the film is funny because it never loses its humor. Scene after scene is a scene of laughter, which keeps succeeding, even toward the end. The film is hilarious and comical, as well as very twisty, with various twists occurring that you don't see approaching. The Monty Python group wonderfully succeeds with this film, while also successfully making fun of the Arthurian times. Well done.",

Yet the strangeness of the original sketch show carries over with ease. My favourite \"subtle\" joke is when a scene with Sir Gallahad and a nurse drags for too long, so unrelated characters interrupt the scene to say, \"Get on with it.\" Some of these characters weren't even introduced. I have yet to see and enjoy better shattering of the cinematic realm. You don't need to be a medieval fantasy fanatic to appreciate Holy Grail as a parody. You don't need to have seen Flying Circus to appreciate the Dadaist comedy of the six-man troupe Monty Python. Watch Holy Grail at least once, and it should become very clear why this is raved as one of the funniest movies of all time.",

            "content": "Obsessively Quoted by Geeks Everywhere  \r\n\r\nI have a friend who has never seen this movie.  Okay, there are lots of people who have never seen this movie.  However, she's started to watch it several times.  The problem has been that, every time she goes to watch it, she does so in company with a large number of people who have already seen it.  Invariably, they spend the entire movie quoting the movie they are watching.  The worst of it is that they quote scenes that haven't come up yet.  My friend finds the whole thing so deeply frustrating that she's never bothered to finish it, and I don't blame her.  I first saw it when it was airing on Comedy Central (or possibly one of its earlier incarnations) when I was in high school, and that's bad enough.  However, to see it in circumstances like those?  Intolerable.  I've told her she should watch it with me, because I won't do that, but she's a bit burned out on the subject.\r\n\r\nThis is, at least vaguely, the story of Arthur, King of the Britons (Graham Chapman).  He is gathering knights to join him at his castle at Camelot.  They are also going in search of the Holy Grail, the cup from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper.  He gathers several knights--not too many, because it's hard for them when they all have to appear in the same scene.  But there is Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Robin (Eric Idle), and Sir Not Appearing in This Film (William Palin).  They have adventures--Sir Galahad finds Castle Anthrax and its Grail-shaped beacon; Sir Lancelot slaughters pretty much an entire wedding party; Sir Robin bravely runs away.  There are musical numbers.  There is animation.  There is the fearsome rabbit.  There are the taunting Frenchmen.  There are, most shockingly of all for a Python film, female characters actually played by women.  There isn't much of a plot, and there basically isn't an ending.\r\n\r\nI've said before that the Pythons are the only group I can think of who preferred their experience filming in Tunisia, and having read some of what went wrong on this one, I can understand why.  At least in Tunisia, they weren't wearing wet wool and staying in a hotel with an inadequate supply of running water.  Graham Chapman had the DTs.  John Cleese filmed one scene standing on a cliff where, if he fell on one side, the drop could have killed him.  If he fell on the other, \"it could have maimed me.\"  It's true that Camelot was only a model, because the Scottish Department of the Environment refused them permission to film in any of its castles, which is most of the castles in Scotland, because the script was \"incompatible with the[ir] history and fabric.\"  They were given this with two weeks' notice, so they had to use two privately owned castles over and over and just hope no one noticed.  I won't say everything that could go wrong did, but quite a lot went wrong, and less did in Tunisia on [i]Life of Brian[/i].\r\n\r\nPeople forget, or else don't realize, that the only Python without an \"Oxbridge\" education is Terry Gilliam, the American.  (Who went to Occidental, not itself a bad school, even if it isn't in quite the same league.)  This means that they are versed in all sorts of things that make it onscreen in surprising ways.  A knight running from a rabbit is a common medieval symbol of cowardice, for example, and so Sir Robin runs from the rabbit in our film.  Of course the monks are chanting in proper Latin; as [i]Life of Brian[/i] would later show, the Pythons know their Latin.  But more specifically, they are singing ecclesiastical Latin, an excerpt from the rites for the dead.  Even having Frenchmen in England is probably a reference to things like the Battle of Hastings.  The story isn't quite as full of historical parody of [i]Life of Brian[/i], which was full of nuggets about first-century Palestine, but there's still enough to keep a history major amused.\r\n\r\nI don't have as much of a problem with people who obsessively quote this movie.  After all, I've seen it, and the quotes aren't spoiling anything for me.  What I do have a problem with is people who quote the movie in place of being funny themselves.  Someone I knew when I was in grade school did \"the Holy Hand Bouquet of Antioch\" at her wedding, and that was funny.  Randomly quoting from this movie is less so.  The issue with Yvonne's wedding was the context.  She got a friend to read from an enormous book, and they went through the whole thing.  It wasn't as funny as it was during the movie, but it was funnier than someone who just quoted those lines for no good reason randomly during a conversation about something else.  It is true that \"Pythonesque\" is a real word in real dictionaries, though not the one my browser uses.  I've heard an argument that its very existence means that they failed at their humour, and I don't accept that, but I do believe being funny is more than just being a parrot, alive or dead.",

Sus 6 miembros ya tenían un muy exitoso programa de televisión que ya había amasado una notoria fanaticada, cuando decidieron incursionar en producir una película. Prueba de que sus fans surgían en lugares insospechados, es que la icónica banda musical Pink Floyd financió gran parte de los costos del filme con las ganancias de su album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". Claro, que los fondos no eran ilimitados y algunas decisiones de presupuesto generaron algunos de sus mejores chistes, ya que el hecho que los caballeros anden a pie, fingiendo que iban a caballo con un escudero atrás haciendo el sonido de los cascos con cocos, surgió de la situación de que no había plata suficiente para alquilar caballos, y que dicha que fué así! Aunque en el programa era usual que ellos cubrieran inclusive los personajes femeninos de los sketches, me imagino que por ser su primer filme expuesto a un mayor público que podía no conocerlos bien todavía, fueron conservadores y casi todos los roles femeninos son hechos por mujeres, sin embargo aún así, los 6 cómicos se encargan de 37 personajes diferentes del filme.

            "content": "Will I give this movie the full rating? Ni!\r\n\r\nPLOT:King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are sent by God to recover the Holy Grail. It is a simple story told in different adaptions over and over in various ways, but this way is the most memorable, with goofy twists and classic moments.\r\n\r\nACTING:The Monty Python troupe serves it up the best they can. Their brand of silly-yet-serious, sarcastic, and dumb acting works in every movie, even if the movie itself sucks.\r\n\r\nSCORE:Typical, but meant to be that way. Fun songs, and a nice piano interlude near the end.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS/ANIMATION:This had both. The animation is of the typical Monty Python brand, which works well, considering this IS a Monty Python film. Duh! The effects were really low-budget and bad looking, but I think they were meant to be that way, so I won't bash them too hard.\r\n\r\nCAMERAWORK:FOr a Monty Python film, there is actually some very nice, nostalgic camerawork in here.\r\n\r\nOTHER CONTENT:Why didn't I give this the full? You may ask. Well, the answer is that I find it to be over-ridiculous at times. I mean, I know it's supposed to be that way, but I just can't get into it. It doesn't interest me as it may some. I guess that's why they call it a cult movie. Also, I hated the ending a lot. I know it was supposed to give off the initial \"That was it?\" reaction, but like I said, I just can't get into it. On the bright side, it does have some of the most memorable quotes, such as \"It's just a flesh wound!\" and \"I fart in your general direction!\"\r\n\r\nOVERALL,a great Monty Python movie with memorable version of a classic plot, greatly original acting, made-to-be typical score, made-to-be bad effects, greatly original animation, nostalgic camerawork, and memorable quotes. But there are times where I find it overly ridiculous that I just can't get into, not to mention the ending..",

Everything is unique and highly original about this film there is not much to dislike about this film, except maybe the ending but this only symbolises the monty pythonesque way of never telling a punchline.\nThe only reason why this film is not a 100% film is because that like most comedies it is certainly less funnier the more times you watch it, unless you give it a space of time for nostagia to kick in. Also I think the ending, though typically pythonesque leaves you feeling a bit deflated thats the only issue! But it is a fairly minor problem, it is a great film and very funny.",

This was the film that introduced me to Monty Python in the first place, and with its instant appeal - stoked by cleverly written humour, brilliant set-pieces, charismatic acting, and a whole host of memorable moments - it became my favourite comedy film of all time, and without hesitation, I can say this is simply the greatest film ever made. I could go on and on about my favourite moments from the film, but that would take forever. What I will comment on is how the Monty Python group has made incredibly effective use of their skills at playing numerous roles. They fit so well into the plethora of different roles that it's as though each role was a different pair of clothes. The film brandishes an excellently impersonated medieval style, blended with the group's signature style of surreal humour and farcical twists. It ultimately concludes in the total opposite of how every other re-telling of the King Arthur legend is told, with the knights being thwarted in the silliest possible way. The ending is only slightly jarring, but in such a way that it actually works well with the rest of the film. A well-aged classic, this is the kind of film that, sadly, can never be made again. After all, you can only make the greatest film of all-time once.",

Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work.  Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch-weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.",

The amount of stupendous incredulity it showcases at each and every turning point simply baffles and confounds reason to all new comedic heights. But then again, it would have lost all its effective charm were that NOT the case. I firmly feel quite reasonable in awarding this, in my personal measure, a full five stars, not only because it was funny and humorous, but also because of its gags, under-hand and not-so-apparent exposes of non-sequiturs, goofs and the like, which in the end proved to be more classic than all the rest of its humor. To be honest, this is definitely the silliest comedy I've ever seen. It's full of impossible anachronistic plot, filled with innuendos and parodies, and of course deadpan humor. But the plot-line held on strongly, with effective timing, choreography, plus quite an amount of parallel storytelling which really evoked my interest throughout. Without the likes of John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, and the rest of its cast and crew, all this would not have been possible at all. In the end, as with its ravishing beginning (with those \"opening credits\"), Monty Python and the Holy Grail is definitely one of the funniest films I've seen thus far. At any rate, it's surely the silliest.",

The story follows King Arthur and his knights on the quest and it was based on Arthurian Legend ... of course, when the story was directed by Jones and Gilliam, you'll expect that will not follow the legend entirely. Along with the rest of the Pythons, Jones and Gilliam performed several roles in the film, but it was Chapman who took the lead as King Arthur. It was nice that John Cleese returned to the group for the film, feeling that the group were once again breaking new ground. Holy Grail was filmed on location, in picturesque rural areas of Scotland, and the money for filming were raised in part with investments from rock groups such as Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull and Led Zeppelin...\r\n\r\nThe influence of this group of funny men is huge... amongst the more visible ones is the inclusion of terms either directly from, or derived from, Monty Python, into the lexicon of the English language. The most obvious of these is the term 'pythonesque', which has become a byword in surreal humour, and is included in standard dictionaries.\r\nIf you like the silly British humour - it is a must - if you're just a normal person, feel free to skip it!",

The humor in this movie made it clear that whoever this Monty Python guy was, he obviously knows how to write jokes.  Later in life I discovered the other Python films and the TV series, but none of them measured up to the genius of this film.  I'm not sure why this movie is so much better in my estimation, but it is.  The Monty Python cast is superbly funny in this movie, of course.  I'm particularly fond of John Cleese, but all the guys are amazing here.\n\nTo be frank, it feels like this movie shouldn't work.  Similar to the TV shows this movie is essentially just a series of little skits that are loosely held together by an overarching story.  Yet each one of those short skits is hysterical genius.  I can't help laughing uncontrollably at most of it, even though it largely makes no sense whatsoever.  I'm not sure what it is that makes British humor like this work so well, but despite the inanity of the situations, it all just plays as wildly hilarious.  Even some of the more gory/bloody moments in this film have a surprising humor about them.\n\nThe negative of this movie is simply that this type of comedy is definitely an acquired taste.  If you weren't born with the gene that allows you to laugh when a knight who says \"Ni\" is startled by the word \"it\" then there's no possible way you will appreciate this film.  That's part of the drawback of British humor because people either get it, or they don't, and there are very few people in between.  Luckily I am blessed with the necessary sense of humor,and that means this is, in my opinion, one of the funniest comedies of all time.",

I caught this on Netflix so paying that monthly service has films of this high quality and it would pay for people to watch these to ensure younger audiences experience such a classic film. This is how sketch comedy films should be made, having the overall arc provides the backbone to launch into anything they want.

Also there were wierd scences or transitions that were cartoonish, but you get use to it kinda. also the ending was a huge, huge dissaster i didnt like it. but everything else rocked",

What can you say about this that hasn't already been said before?  Even if you've never seen it, you've surely been around people riffing it without your knowing.  This is the Monty Python troupe on the very top of their game, and there is a sick genius here that transcends budgetary constraints.  Every single scene is reference worthy and laugh out loud funny, and it is one of those comedies that just gets funnier every time you see it, which is damn hard to accomplish, because so much of comedy relies on the element of surprise.  From the knights who say ni to the black knight to the killer rabbit to the dissertation on African and European swallows, there's plenty here to keep you rolling around in your seat.

This isn't your ordinary comedy that contains repetitive jokes and humor that repeats the same drug and fart jokes from previous comedy flicks. This is comedy that is quite original and will definitely bring in some great laughs, if you don't mind the silly setting. I liked the fact of  how the Monty Python crew act silly and poked fun at the legendary myth of King Arthur and his quest for the Holy Grail. You have this epic journey that all of us have read or heard about and the crew did a tremendous job of just making a complete joke out of their travels. During their journey, the knights will go through various encounters that brings in a type of humor that is definitely unimaginable and original. The stuff the characters go through may look a little childish and silly, but how the crew played out these scenarios worked really well, making the film enjoyable and fun; just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the absolute foolishness brought by the crew. \r\n\r\nI'll probably go and say that the humor is smart because it doesn't present any downright crud and playing out scenarios hilariously to a point where you will have fun, even if you are not laughing out loud. The comedic timing was absolutely superb and presented many classical scenes that will make it hard to point out a favorite. None of the jokes were out of control or pushed the limits to cause controversy, what this film presented were original jokes that I wouldn't have imagined to be put onto screen. The film played out these comic book related scenarios and successfully pulling these course of events perfectly. I really found myself laughing constantly, even up to points where my stomach would hurt.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really found unique was how the Python crew will portray as more than one character. There are no boundaries to what type of role they will play, either acting as a young/old man or woman, hero/villain, minor characters, etc. This is what I find unique and great about their films because it is definitely something you will never see and they pulled it off perfectly. You won't know what type of character they will play and they do a great job of acting as their roles. This film is definitely a recommendation to all, as you will have a great time watching this film, while laughing your guts out.",

That being said, there seams to be a certain amount of depth to it that many comedies just do not deliver upon.  The actual conversations while often totally ridiculous, are almost always interesting.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what really interested me with this film however, is it's sense of place.  In the process of being totally ludicrous and arguably trying too hard to be funny, the picture has a grimy, dirty, cold look to it, exactly the look i would expect out of a tale about a bunch of medieval knights, it lend a great deal of authenticity to it's otherwise silly premise.  Also, when the film winks it's eye at you and decides to briefly play it straight, it's as good as any adventure drama available, but then you recall everyone is riding imagined horses as they thunder onward. funny stuff.\r\n\r\nMonty Python and The Holy Grail is an immeasurably silly spoof on King Aurthur's search for the holy grail, with a great sense of place providing some authenticity.",

            "content": "This movie is so beloved by its rabid cult followers that it makes it unenjoyable for the rest of us. THERE I SAID IT. Anglophiles are a serious problem in America, people with an uncomfortable love of the British who so rabidly eat up and defend everything the country has produced you feel like maybe you shouldn't like it so you don't have to be like them. Which is too bad, because I do like Monty Python, I REALLY do. Sketch Comedy has long been one of my favorite modes of entertainment but having spent hours watching Kids in the Hall and Whitest Kids U'Know they may not be my favorite, but I don't think there will ever be another Python. They remind me a lot of children's cartoons but more for the adult audience and can also be enjoyed by children as opposed to vice versa. The writing is certainly clever and most of the time adult but everything is handled so light heartedly and silly you find it hard finding reasons too not let them watch it. Not just the classics either, most episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus are pretty hilarious from start to finish but as later sketch comedy groups have shown even the best of this genre are not necessarily good at making movies. Python were one of the first to give it the old college try though, filming the Holy Grail between seasons of the show mostly on location in Scotland. However it the film seemed doomed from the get go, with a low budget, dispute among the members and other things setting them back which begs the question is this film worth the worship so many give it? Let's take a look that is but a flesh wound.\r\n\r\nThe film is shot a lot like a series of skits with the same theme around the middle but we start things off with the set up which is that King Arthur (Graham Chapman, who was PISS Drunk during the making of this my God) is assembling his Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Lancelot (John Cleese who gets the best roles in this movie if you ask me), Sir Robin (Eric Idle who's supporting characters are a lot funnier but Sir Robin's cool), Sir Bedevere the Not So Wise (Terry Jones who is probably the most underrated of the group) and his squire Patsy (Gilliam who's...very weird as typical of him) to go fetch the Holy Grail as God has tasked him. Basically it's an exceedingly silly take on the classic King Arthur Legend and all the knights go their separate ways to find the grail so that the members of the troupe can cheaply play all of the characters in the film. Along the way they encounter classic trials and tribulations like the dreaded Knights who say Ni, Carol Cleveland's tits and a three headed knight who eats people among other things.\r\n\r\nAlright first of all let me again say, the crazed, rabid fan base of this film RUIN it for the rest of us. The Knights who say NI were HILARIOUS the first time I saw them I was in stitches with every line masterfully delivered in that ridiculous voice by Michael Palin. I loved the exchange between Eric Idle's Dead Ringer and some man trying to dispose of their father the first time I saw that as well and understood why everyone else loved it so much. I found all of these classic scenes and gags funny. Until the fucking fans of this movie both insufferable people I know and my own actual friends quoted these fucking scenes ad infinitum at which point I wanted to create a time machine to make sure this never existed. I don't understand why this movie in particular people have to ruin SO much to the point it's become a pop culture joke it's not like the movie's perfect by any means. Some of the jokes are utterly pointless other than to satisfy their low budget like the coconut replacing horses not that, that's not charming in its own right. Jones and Gilliam co directed this film and you can see the two drastically different directors pulling it in two different directions. Gilliam has an eye for the absurd and crazy and handles many scenes as such sometimes at the expense of the joke, like the whole Castle Anthrax business. Jones is much less creative, but honestly much better suited for this type of film. Furthermore certain parts seem incredibly sophomoric and childish in all the wrong ways, causing the scenes to drag on and on much longer than they should like...The Castle Anthrax scene again which is easily the flimsiest \"sketch\" of the movie. And furthermore Graham Chapman is very good and funny in some scenes but as has now become common knowledge was a raging alcoholic when this was filmed and this shows in a NUMBER of different scenes, too many.\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't hold a movie's fan base against it, they can choose what type of people their film will appeal too but now how said people will act on this liking. But when a movie has as many flaws as this you probably like me really want too, if nothing else just to rub all the things it does wrong in their smarmy little faces. I think most nerds have a touch of anglophile to them and as such most nerds can admit that at some point at least they've liked this movie which may explain how bafflingly over the top people react to this. I liked this movie, this is a damn fine movie and one of the best comedies both of the 70s and all time. But guys, at the end of the day it's still the third best Python movie out of three. But of course it's the Pythons so the touch of excellence is still there and if you haven't watched this it's time to stomach all those lines you've heard too many times before and give it a try.",

Three years after compiling some skits from that series into a 1971 film, the gang released this film, arguably their first true feature-length work, whilst still faithful to the offbeat, farcical, often nonsensical taste that popularized them.\n\nread it all at my blog",

            "content": "More than one person has confessed to me that they just don't 'get' Monty Python. Some of them have asked what it is they're overlooking, what the point is. I tell them that they aren't overlooking anything. The whole point of Monty Python is that there is no point. It's nonsensical, over-the-top, and you either get it or you don't. Or you do and you're highly offended. I confess that I don't get all of their routines, Confuse-A-Cat for example, but I find most of their material hilarious. And no-where are they funnier than in Holy Grail.\r\n\tEven if you've never seen the movie, or don't have any idea who or what Monty Python is, you already know parts of this movie. Things like the killer bunny, the knights who say Ni, and the Black Knight \"Tis only a flesh wound!\" have become part of popular culture. Who in the English speaking world hasn't heard of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch? Many people may not know where it came from, but they've heard of it. Same for the infamous cries of \"Bring out your dead!\"\r\n Practically all of the film's uproarious routines are widely known, and can be recited word for word by legions of fans. Every scene is just plain funny, and how could they not be, considering the people involved. John Cleese, Erik Idle, and the rest are simply master comedians. Their timing and delivery are perfect, and more importantly, they have some of the most brilliant, deranged imaginations anywhere. \r\nThese guys come up with ideas unlike any that have been thought of before, like a three headed giant who argues with himself about tea and scones, or an order of knights dedicated to shrubberies and the saying of a fictional curse, or a giant cartoon beast that nearly kills the heroes before the animator suffers a fatal heart attack. Or they use deliberate anachronisms, like medieval peasants spouting socialist dogma, or King Arthur killing a noted historian who was recapping the last scene. Yeah, Monty Python breaks the fourth wall fairly often.\r\nAnd they also come up with totally new ways of looking at a well known subject. Take the princess trapped in the castle, who must be rescued by a brave knight. Here they turn the situation on its head by substituting a whiny prince for the beautiful princess, and manage to skewer both sappy song-and-dance numbers and mindless violence while they're at it. Witch hunts are another familiar subject. We've all seen plenty of witch burnings in the movies, but this is the first time that the accused witch is tried using the latest \"scientific methods.\" The logic displayed here is \"more tortured than Pavarotti at a Tiny Tim concert\" to quote Scott Adams, and it's absolutely side splitting.\r\nHoly Grail was the epitome of randomness long before the term had been coined. It is a total farce, in which even the opening credits and the intermission are a joke. It's silly, it's inane, it's insane, it has plot holes you could drive a truck through, and it's one of my favorite comedies.",
