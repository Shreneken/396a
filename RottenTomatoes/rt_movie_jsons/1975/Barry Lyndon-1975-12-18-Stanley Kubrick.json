    "summary": "How does an Irish lad without prospects become part of 18th-century English nobility? For Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) the answer is: any way he can! His climb to wealth and privilege is the enthralling focus of this sumptuous Stanley Kubrick version of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel.",

            "content": "This is on one hand quite a lavish period drama and on the other hand also quite understated, as its a slow, somewhat plodding watch but it features some lovely scenes of many characters partaking in card games, dances and other leisurely pursuits. On the other hand, there are some battle scenes and soldiers are shown being shot to the ground like flies in a perhaps unnerving way. \n\nI liked the use of classical music in the background of many scenes - it felt quite an atmospheric watch overall, although I did get a little bit confused about the precise details of Barry's journeys. While watching it, I felt it was surprisingly engrossing. Its a bit slow but its certainly an enjoyable watch, or so I felt anyway. I liked that there's some soft lighting used and indeed some scenes had the look/feel of a dream almost.\n\nI liked the scenes set outside the stately homes, with pretty backdrops as well as the many people in costume making it a quite appealing watch. The plot itself may seem a little bare but there is plenty to interest the viewer regardless. I liked seeing how the young son grew up, for one thing.\n\nIf your a fan of character based period dramas then I would definitely recommend this film, although it does seem somewhat pompous, it is certainly quite good and I liked that it, if but lightly, mocks nobility.",

While slower paced and more grounded than his other previous works, including 2001 A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange, it is still an engaging and original film. I liked the storyline and felt that while the pace was slower than other films, it's very well paced and never lingers on or looses footing. While not my favorite of Kubrick films, especially with such masterpieces as the aforementioned and others, this certainly is no misfire from the profound Director.",

            "content": "Stanley Kubrick is simply the master — this is not a controversial statement. I've delayed viewing this film because I tend to find pieces set during this time period (by \"this,\" I mean Renaissance to Pre-WWI, a big-ass gap in time) to be highfalutin and kind of a drag. We get the opposite in Barry Lyndon. Based on the picaresque novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon, the film sets the tone early with a picturesque duel — and this will be far from the only duel in this story. Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal — an American who can pull of the accent), the Irish Rogue, embarks on a voyage launched by love and heartbreak (and another duel) onto the European continent where he is subjected to the horrors of war. Given the film's style, length, and (96) score, it's unsurprising that it contains everything: the loss of friends, newfound love, bare-knuckle boxing, desertion, corporal punishment, drinking and swindling, monetary success and social status — and bankruptcy — the thirst for revenge, attempted suicide, and, most gorgeously constructed but heart-wrenchingly painful, the death of a child. There are scenes that look like they've been lifted straight out of a Vermeer painting. It is one more testament to the investment of practical effects. I could go into detail about the magnificent \"Card Game\" scene, but just watch this section of a Cinefix YouTube clip instead. The dialogue is sharp and doesn't get lost in \"oldspeak\" (mine). Moreover, I had flinched at the beginning when I heard the narrator (Michael Hordern) — as I had recently switched off a Netflix series because of the awful voiceover — but found it not only tolerable, but necessary for the film. David Morley as Barry's son (Redmond Barry becomes Barry Lyndon) is one of the better child actors I've seen. The way the story comes back to Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali), Barry's mistreated step-son, couldn't have been better for the ending conflict. You root for him — at least I did — even though you've been on this ride with Barry for 2 ½ hours already. *Side Note* It's insane how they take turns during a duel instead of engaging in the turn-and-shoot version with which I had been familiar. Barry Lyndon joins good-company with A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, and 2001: A Space Odyssey as Kubrick creations that sit at the top of my favorites.",

At the end of the day I just didnt care what happened to Barry good or bad. He was an unlikable character almost from the start and continued to get worse esp in the second half. The heroine was also someone I couldnt invest in. The story line was mostly predictable and shallow. The child part was one of the only humane parts but it didnt feel believable or investigated. at times i think Wes Anderson was influenced by this film, with the narration in between scenes. While influential and beautifully done I didnt enjoy this one that much for what it was.",

As things changed, he also changed. Once a helpless innocent man became a man of cruelty and immorality. Finally, he got what he deserved. Vengeance paid off on him and lost everything he gained. \n\nThis movie advocates the philosophy of change in life and also it says that nothing is permanent. One day the mortal coil will be lost.

I generally appreciate this style of book or film where the audience leisurely follows a character over many years or decades, getting to actually experience the effects earlier events will have later in their life. Class struggle and moral growth were the main themes I honed in on on this first watch, but there were certainly others worthy of exploration.

In this 3 hour long art piece, we explore the adventures and misadventures, the rise and fall of Irish peasant Redmond Barry who, after a rigged duel with a coward English general, has to run away. He is robbed while travelling and with no money and means of transportation, he is to join the English Army, which partakes in the Seven Year War. He witnesses the horrors of war and death, so he decides to once again, run away. Though this time he is captured by the Prussian Army. Anyway, after a lot of luck and heroism, he is given a job in Vienna as a spy, though his roots and nostalgia about his home country exhort him to leave with an Irish Chevalier, with whom he learns the tricks of card playing. While travelling, he meets Lady Lyndon, who he seduces and eventually marries. That's where the first act ends. Mr. Barry has virtually anything he has ever wanted: a family, a respectable position, wealth and fame. Though everything goes downhill from the second act. Barry, who wants to achieve the status of a Lord, spends huge amounts of money into paintings and estates. Eventually, he goes bankrupt, his child dies after falling off a horse, and his wife becomes demented. The only one who will dare to stop him is his estranged step son, who loathes Barry and wants to have his bloodline out of his home.  First of all, the movie is amazing. Every scene and shot in this film was carefully created and taken in a way that it looks like a true painting. That is thanks to John Alcott's cinematography, which I praise way too much. He used photographic lens used by Nasa to shoot scenes with natural light, and yes, almost no artificial light was used for the interior scenes. One might say that the performances are bland, however I must say that the cast is most good. Ryan O' Neal is reserved and cunning, Leon Vitali is serious yet scared, Partick Magee shines as the Chevalier and Marisa Berenson is pure madness. The production, screenplay and diretion is, as always, a treat, since this is one of Kubrick's most beloved projects (it is very similar to a Napoleon project he never got to create), he spent hours and hours of meticulous detail and research into this film. The music is delightful, the costumes are spot on and the makeup is just perfect. Overall, Barry Lyndon is a sensation, an underrated achievement that deserves more attention, though its lenght is too long and the performances needed just a bit more passion and energy.",

He is a phenomenon more than he is a person or an artist or a storyteller. His calmness never holds the screen. It should. But it doesn't. Instead, it melts like warm butter. That, right there, remains to be a mystery. The unfathomable perspective that he spins on the known stories is both dangerous and sensual. The long slow seductive process that is exhaustingly beautiful casts a flattering impact on us, leaving us buzzed and provoked on the themes he explores.\n\nIt is a date night movie in that sense. Despite being ironic in its bones and inhumanly dark in its analysation of the behavior that you would expect. And no, it doesn't shock anywhere to what it has to display. If anything it is a slow burn. You can predict the banality that these characters would go through and it is exactly how it goes. Not only now you are hooked to see the self created doom but also are waiting for Kubrick to put it on screen with his unique visual storytelling skills.\n\nThe result is pure joy. Perpetually even, balanced in \"how\" it has to say. \"What\" has to say gets deliberately lost into the dust. The film is a character driven journey of a guy trying to fit into the change in the social norms of a bygone era where too, it found difficulty to enhance his views. The film starts from zooming in, framing the world that our protagonist lives in and fails to be unselfish in its vocab. As the film develops the camera zooms out to mock his character that thinks he understood the sacrifices and importance of the others in this world. While the truth of the matter is, Barry Lyndon isn't mature enough to take care of himself, let alone others.",

            "content": "I can confidently say that this is one of my favorite films having recently seen it and having had all of my doubts about it going in completely invalidated while I was blown away by a spectacular feat of filmmaking. This film is technically remarkable as the score, costumes, set design and cinematography are all mind-blowing but it's more than just those elements that make this very Kubrickian costume drama work. Having previously said that I think Nashville (1975) was the best film of 1975 I feel that I absolutely must retract my statement as this film is undoubtedly one of the best I have ever seen, up there with Apocalypse Now (1979) and Kubrick's own 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). This is one of those films you absolutely have to see if you love cinema as even though it does not get spoken about as much as Dr. Strangelove (1964) or The Shining (1980) it's probably Kubrick's first or second best film.\n\nInexperienced teenager Redmond Barry, Ryan O'Neal, becomes distanced from his family after challenging his cousin and lover's tutor to a duel which he ‘wins' but which we later learn was staged to get him out of the picture. He travels across Europe but is robbed and ultimately ends up as a common soldier but is able to rise through the ranks again when he deserts the army and meets Captain Potzdorf, Hardy Kruger, who at first forces him back into servitude but later helps him after Barry saves his life. He is able to escape from Prussia with the help of Chevalier, Patrick Magee, but rises even further than his superiors when he seduces the rich Lady Lyndon, Marisa Berenson, and marries her, inheriting her husband's fortune, after he dies. He adopts the title ‘Barry Lyndon' after marriage and lives lavishly but his acrimonious relationship with his stepson Lord Bullingdon, Leon Vitali, could prove to be his downfall.\n\nThe film's beauty cannot be understated as the stunning imagery of nearly every shot in the film appears to have been heavily choreographed so that even simple shots of someone staring into the camera appear devastatingly gorgeous. Occasionally the camera will just stop and focus on a particularly beautiful arrangement of people rigidly posed in beautiful costumes while the finery around them glitters and their emptiness becomes clear. I was sometimes disturbed by how stiff the actors appear in these moments as we feel as though we are watching a painting of inanimate objects instead of people going about their day. Kubrick understands the nature of performance in the lives of those who were members of the upper class in the eighteenth century and the visual techniques he uses to convey these people's lives tell us everything we need to know and more.\n\nThe score is also brilliant as it is just as showy and over the top as you would expect coming from a Kubrick film but it fits the tone perfectly and punctuates some of the best moments in the film. Beyond the pageantry of the film however is an interesting, well told story as Kubrick employs his usual detachment to comment upon the life of a man who fell upon good fortune instead of ever really earning it. Barry never quite fits anywhere and yet he is able to ingratiate himself into the lives of those who are more powerful than him and in that way score a small victory. Yet, for all of the underdog characteristics he has Kubrick steadfastly refuses to present him as a sympathetic hero as we seem him lying, cheating and stealing in his attempts to get to the top and the amount of luck he falls upon is more infuriating to the audience than appealing. It's because of our lack of emotional involvement in Barry's affairs that we can see just how shallow he and the society he exists in are and Kubrick makes a unique, revolutionary film that manages to convey a simple message with stunning clarity.\n\nI really found myself loving this film as the hours raced by while watching it and although O'Neal isn't giving the strongest performance that's not what the film requires and what it does well it does better than almost any other film, it's a testament to the power of filmmaking.

            "content": "Stanley Kubrick's most dull film.\n\nUnfortunately, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) is the textbook example of a film perfectly made on a technical level that leaves you cold with little emotional involvement. I never agreed with the common criticism of Kubrick that his films are cold and devoid of emotional connection, yet after viewing Barry Lyndon, I must agree on this one.\n\nFor the record, I love many Kubrick films like Spartacus, 2001, Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and Paths of Glory. However, Barry Lyndon is far too long, too slow, and too dull with nearly nothing happening. We are supposed to be riveted by this man's downfall, but he is so unlikable and odd that I just cannot bring myself to care. It's not even that this is a period piece as I love many films within this genre, I just did not care for Barry Lyndon.\n\nStanley Kubrick's direction is so creative and stunning. The cinematography is gorgeous as every frame looks like a renaissance painting. But all the lavish wealth of expensive sets, pretty costumes, and period accurate style is lost on me as I could not get emotionally invested in these characters.\n\nPerhaps it is the writing. The dialogue and story are excellent and it is certainly told well. But the editing could have cut this film down by half and it still would have dragged. Kubrick likes to linger on shots to draw out suspense, but the pacing is so dry and slow that I constantly wandered mentally.\n\nThe score is gorgeous and mesmerizing with the endless store of classical music adapted for Barry Lyndon. It fits the classy aesthetic and pretty sets and costumes.\n\nI think the real issue is not just Kubrick's lack of emotion in his direction, but in the lead performance from Ryan O'Neal. He plays the part to perfection going through the motions, but I never feel like he believes this character. He seems so distant and out of touch with what is happening. His Irish accent does not sound convincing to me either. I just feel like he is hapless for the character, but unfortunately O'Neal is also incredibly dull to watch.\n\nLikewise, Marisa Berenson is so bland as Lady Lyndon. She hardly says a word and feels like Kubrick placed her there to just look pretty. She is absolutely breathtaking, but Berenson gets nothing at all to do. She is wasted on Kubrick's inability to write women apparently. She displays a believable depression and boredom, but that in itself is not very interesting to watch either. Together with Ryan O'Neal, they make for the most mismatched couple in cinema history as a bunch of milquetoast mannequins.\n\nThe few supporting roles in Barry Lyndon are all more intriguing than the leads. Patrick Magee is great as the kindly Irish Chevalier. Hardy Kruger is fiercely intelligent and perceptive as Captain Potzdorf. Gay Hamilton is lovely and enchanting as the flirtatious Nora. Essentially, all the supporting actors and actresses deliver better performances than Ryan O'Neal.\n\nI would not say I hated Barry Lyndon, but it did not entertain me. For all its wit and clever dialogue satirizing the shallow opulence, greed, and manipulation of the aristocracy, Barry Lyndon itself is not very engaging. Kubrick is still a phenomenal director, but does not fit period dramas despite the stunning appearance of his film.",

            "content": "Of course, everyone who sees this knows already the story about how Kubrick chose to light the film with only natural sources-but consider the effect in a scene like the one where Barry chats late one night in a tent with his avuncular officer. Lit by only a handful of candles, the actors were told to remain as perfectly still as they could muster so as to stay in focus. Or in the many zoom outs, like the one with Barry gazing hopelessly over the edge right after being embarrassed by Bully during the recital: The camera pulls back slowly with Barry kept dead center, perfectly still even as he shrinks in comparison to the wider world just revealed. Or in the duels which bookend Barry's ambitions, always underscored by the same instrumental variation from Handel: Unlike a chaotic gunfight in a mythologized western, here the participants stand utterly motionless, as if dead already.\n\nThe point is that this is a film of paralysis, where the lighting, camera movements, stage blocking, and even music contribute to the film's sense of overwhelming stagnation-all this even as the story has a truly (albeit ironically) epic scope, ranging across a lifetime, social classes, combatant countries, Europe in war and in peace. In an age (and a genre of filmmaking) we often look back upon as deeply sincere, of a burgeoning romanticism, and utterly passionate, Kubrick drenches the whole thing in a comic irony truer to the wry spirit of Byron and Thackeray than period pieces ever know to try. A BBC adaptation of Austen or Tolstoy this is not, lacking all pretense of billowing emotion and heartbreaking sensibility.\n\nRather, Kubrick's choices aim to show the romantic age with romanticizing it, without looking back with the artificial light and gloss of retrospection. What does it mean to portray an era with authenticity? Does it merely mean getting the costuming, the set design, and the specific cant right? For Kubrick-who here is following up his very similar speculative forays into the future-I think veracity means exposing how the accoutrement, the style and look of an age, in fact betray its bones, its spirit (this is all very Hegelian, obviously, and so once more true to the time). And what is more true of this pre-Napoleonic period than its sense of paralysis? It is an era when rising above one's born lot was practically impossible, as it finally is for the futile Barry, whose efforts are for naught in the end. It is an era when women (to say nothing about people of color, who quite literally could say nothing, and so don't here) have absolutely no political or social influence outside the confines of domesticity, utterly stuck in their patriarchal role. It is an era when change-in hat style (a very subtle detail in the second half), in musical variation, even in army uniform and allegiance-is only artificial, ultimately functioning to keep the social system fully in place.\n\nIt is Barry's sole redeeming quality, and the thing that makes him both the most modern and the most human character in the whole affair, that he aims throughout for change, to break the cycle of social stagnation and personal paralysis through his great ambition. But Barry is still of his age, and so his efforts come to nothing but his own demise-there is a revolution happening somewhere in the wings, across the pond, but Barry is on the wrong side of things, giving money and men to the King, paying tribute to the phallic master signifier of the ruling order. And so the Oedipal cycle-for of course this all comes down the Oedipal dialectical, the son's attempt to outdo the father and claim the love of the mother (country or personal)-remains unbroken, Bully replacing Barry at Lady Lyndon's side, the (e)state returned to its \"proper\" lineage in a classically tragic ending.",

I mean the decisions that Kubrick made here are so odd and feel wrong in so many ways. Is this intended as satire? At first glance I'd say everything is played as if it's a serious drama, but there were a number of moments where I just had to chuckle because a scene was that bad. And I couldn't help thinking that voiceover was dripping with sarcasm. \n\nWhat in heaven's name is Ryan O'Neal doing in the lead role of this film?! In what world was that a good idea? He plays Barry Lyndon so bland and emotionless that I never get on board with him as a protagonist, and he sucks most of the emotion out of the film. That was bad enough, but there's also the lack of an accent that he sometimes tries to throw in there anyways (and that's disastrous.) He never seems like he belongs in this world at all. There were a couple of acting performances that I actually liked in the movie but most of the cast was not good. \n\nThe one aspect of Barry Lyndon that is undeniably great is the visuals. It is sumptuous, from the battle scenes to the fancy dinners. The lighting is great, the costumes are elaborate, and naturally every shot is framed perfectly. I understand Kubrick even acquired a special camera just for this film to capture candlelit scenes, and he certainly took full advantage of that. I don't know if the fact that the film was nice to look at was enough to make it worth more than 3 hours to watch (complete with an intermission,) but it doesn't hurt.\n\nThat length was a real hurdle for me to get past. There was enough going on in the plot so I didn't get overly bored, but considering I found the main character so unlikable I just wanted it to end. In every way I wasn't connecting with the character of Barry Lyndon, because he was emotionless and he kept making the worst decisions. I'm willing to grant that the movie was well-made, and that there may be more to it than I am able to comprehend, but I found the overall viewing experience frustrating.",

I can't imagine how that would have turned out, I would have loved to see that. But this movie will do. It will do for years to come, being that it is one of my favorite movies of all time and probably my favorite Kubrick movie.\n\nThe set pieces and filming locations make you feel like you're really there. And we are really there as a matter of fact. Kubrick really shot in Ireland, Scotland, and England. Makes me want to live in one of those cottages in the English countryside. A truly beautiful part of the world and England.\n\nThe story in itself is wonderfully written pulling you in ever so closer with every event that happens. It is kind of sad to see this young man turn into a somewhat ruthless and ego-driven person. But in the end, he got what he deserved.\n\nAbsolutely befuddled that Kubrick used lenses from NASA to shoot the candlelit sequences. I can't believe that, A, NASA lent him those lenses, B, Kubrick was up to the challenge of shooting such sequences, and C, that Kubrick had the connections to be able to get his hands on the equipment he did.\n\nOverall, absolutely mesmerizing film.

            "content": "I have been re-watching a bunch of Stanley Kubrick films after seeing the excellent retrospective at the Contemporary Jewish museum. I have always loved his films, since I was a young lad, even if I couldn't quite put my finger on why. After all these years continuously coming back to Kubrick, my finger seems closer to a few revelations.\nFeature filmmaking is an artistic genre bent towards entertainment. The Hollywood system has it's stranglehold on this reality more than ever. The irony for me with Kubrick is that it is the uncompromising artistry and vision of his films that is the primary reason I find them so entertaining. Conversely, I recently watched Jaws and realized that it is the best Spielberg film, precisely because it is the only Spielberg film that he doesn't wreck with his own art-killing brand of crowd pleasing sappiness. I don't blame the studios for this. I just don't see Speilberg is an artist, rather, the A-list Hollywood song and dance man.\nKubrick was a unique figure in American folklore. He achieved popularity and, more importantly to Hollywood, his films caught on and made money. Another irony; it is when Kubrick left Hollywood and began to make essentially European art films, that Hollywood took interest. Kubrick had the artistic freedom of the English studios and Hollywood distribution. A rare symmetry. Essentially, a filmmaker with a nearly unlimited budget but whom refused to make films as entertainments. The results are, in my humble opinion, the most stunning works of cinema of the 20th century. Not just a few Kubricks. I believe that each film is entirely it's own entity. It's own masterpiece, unrelated to each other, with the crucial exception that they were directed with the exact same level of detail, excellence, massive tireless preparation, technical innovation, one of the great eyes for photographic composition, and most underrated, one of the great ears for music.\nWhich brings me to the most underrated of all Kubrick's masterpieces, and, one of my personal favorites: Barry Lyndon. \nThe first thing I would say about Barry Lyndon is that I went and had a quick look at Rotten Tomatoes and to my delight, it had a score of nearly 100% And why not? It's well known that Barry Lyndon was a box office disaster when originally released in 1975 and that Kubrick was deeply depressed by this tepid reaction. But we are also beginniing to realize that Kubrick was ahead of his time. What was considered his \"failure\" 40 years ago is now beginning to be seen as one of his great masterpieces.\nIf you look at Barry Lyndon as an entertainment, well, you're looking at it wrong. Go watch Saving Ryan's Privates. If you look at Barry Lyndon as one of the most audaciously existential and masterfully conceived period films, if not the greatest of all, you are getting warmer to the truth of the film. After re-watching Barry Lyndon last night, for probably the 10th time over the years, it seems to me that once again, Kubrick was attempting to re-invent how stories are told using the medium of cinema. In it's odd way, Barry Lyndon almost feels like a sequel to 2001. They both use detachment, just in very different ways. Here, he is literally trying to present a Thackeray Novel on film. He presents the film with the exact same stateliness one would be greeted with opening up the novel, down to the comforting, meticulous voice of the British narrator. In the past, I heard complaints about the narration as messing with the rhythm of the story, however, this time around, I felt the film would lose it's authenticity and its originality without it. it is a film dependent on every ornate detail. Indeed, never has a film been more painterly. Each scene has a visual magic to it. Kubrick is not content with costumes. These are not costumes. These are the actual clothes worn by Irish country folk and European aristocrats of their day. And everything glows - a literal moving picture. The pantings of the era come to life. The camera zooms backwards, flattening out the image to reveal the painting. Kubrick is hard at work here, in the prime of his career. He is leaving no stone unturned, no detail has a lesser value.\nThe other incredibly unique aspect of this film, and back to the Hollywood theme, Kubrick refuses to give us a hero. It's like baroque film noir. Barry bounds around in the first half of the film, and just when we've grown comfortable rooting for him, he ends up disappointing us. Whoring around and \"little more than a common opportunist\". Kubrick isn't interested in heroes. He's interested in reality. His films are like grandiose mirrors. We see the best and the worst in ourselves there. No one wanted any part of that in a 1975 movie theater.\nI touched on this before: Kubrick had a great pair of ears. Perhaps the greatest ears in the history of film directing. His period research into the music of the era is absolutely stunning. Each scene works perfectly; the entire picture feels like one epic song with piano accompaniment by Stanley Kubrick. The man knows exactly what he's doing with music and it's role in the art design of the film. It is one of my very favorite aspects of any Kubrick film.\nPerhaps the strangest irony of all is that in today's word of instant gratification, reality T.V, Netflix, films that never dare go over 2 hours, or never really dare to do anything at all, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon seems to be finally getting it's due. We love Kubrick because there are no more Kubrick's left in this world. We love Kubrick because his films are strikingly unique. We love him because we are tired of films pandering to us. Tired of Hollywood force feeding us on a tin foil platter. \nBless Kubrick for giving us something that glows and breathes with the amber aura of beeswax, casting thick shadows over the harsh burn of an LED monitor.",

Stanley Kubrick directs the film based on Thackeray's 19th century novel 'The Luck of Barry Lyndon'.  Impeccably slow, stately timing, whether comedic in intention or not, leads the film and highlights the seeming silliness of 18th century historical rituals and naivety of Barry the protagonist. Scenes of violence or outbursts of passion are built up to gently and comfortably. Costumes and set are historically accurate to a fault, which married with patterned character arrangements and perfectly composed shots make the viewer feel as though they are deep in the artwork of Gainsborough or Reynolds each time the camera zooms out. Great humour and beauty, if a little long. 9/10",

Stanley Kubrick worked in many ways to bring natural lighting to the film and bringing executing beautiful scenery from playing poker on one scene with the candles, brings in the unique way to bring to cinematography and a new era for creating new ways to bring into film, which I do believe that Stanley Kubrick is the father of that genre. Four hours sitting into a movie is worth watching. Especially if it has the main title Stanley Kubrick over the title. From us rich colors Rich storyline Rich acting I have ever seen in English 1700 like era. As for this is maybe funny this was supposed to be the same cinematography like in Napoleon which was written before Barry Lyndon. And owning a script play I am very disappointed that MGM or Warner Bros. did not want any part of having FM which is written or directed by Stanley Kubrick what a disappointment but thankfully thankfully we have Barry Lyndon for hidden for the rich cinematography that is deserve an Oscar for god sake Oscars suck it for not having any credits for Stanley Kubrick with his rich cinematography and rich story telling.

            "content": "One would think a three-hour British period drama would be something to endure, rather than enjoy, but Barry Lyndon is damn near a flawless film. Not only that, it's also endlessly watchable. It's as well-paced and plotted as any film I can recollect, and director Stanley Kubrick's sense of time and place is remarkable. The film is often regarded as \"lesser Kubrick\" (if there is such a thing), but for me, there are few Kubrick films greater than Barry Lyndon.\n\nOur title character (played by Ryan O'Neal) begins his life a poor Irish farm boy named Redmond Barry. His father dies when he's very young (in a duel with another man), so he grows up quite close to his mother (Marie Kean). He's also quite close to his cousin, Nora (Gay Hamilton), but she has eyes for Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), who could provide a much better life for the Barry clan than a Redmond/Nora pairing ever would. Redmond, not one to take a rebuke like this lying down, challenges Quin to a duel, and it's the former who comes out alive.\n\nHis mother gives him what little money she has and sends him off to Dublin until the situation cools down. Once there, however, he joins the military and gets his first taste of life with some privilege. He eventually deserts, but is forced to join the friendly Prussian army after being outed by a Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Kruger). Years go by, and Redmond continues plotting and scheming his way out of undesirable situations until he captures the heart of a Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). She's married to a sickly older man, but the life she promises is precisely the one Redmond has always longed for. Unfortunately, as he later learns, the very characteristics that brought him to this place are the ones that could lead to a spectacular fall from grace.\n\nIf every Kubrick film deals with man's \"best of times, worst of times\" to a certain degree, Barry Lyndon does so most plainly and most powerfully. There's nothing plain, of course, about the film's look, but the qualities that sometimes feel like secondary themes in other Kubrick films are undeniably front and center here. Two title cards inform us that the first half of the film chronicles the means by which Redmond Barry acquired the style and title of Barry Lyndon, while the second half focuses on the misfortunes and disasters that befell Barry Lyndon. Such an explicit spelling out of the film's thesis in no way harms one's ability to appreciate or connect with it. On the contrary, with the false notion of subtlety cast aside right away, we can invest ourselves wholly in this absorbing character and the absolutely fascinating contradictions that make him up.\n\nIf Barry Lyndon was simply an attempt to prove the viability of \"Napoleon\", as has been written and discussed in the years since its release, it's hard to tell. This film is exquisitely crafted, and the screenplay (written solely by Kubrick-his second consecutive, but final, solo writing effort) is sheer perfection. Based off of a famous novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, the film chronicles the long and very full life of one man, and Kubrick lets everything play out as it should without resorting to shortcuts that might save time or add excitement at the expense of character development. One example of this is the relatively lengthy sequence during which he two-times Potzdorf and helps a fellow Irishman (Patrick Magee's Chevalier de Balibari) escape a potentially sticky situation. The character dynamics in that moment are a little tricky, but they prove absolutely vital to setting up the rest of the film. Kubrick smartly lets everything develop, while editing these scenes in such a way that the relatively light tone and breezy pace of the film's first half don't let up.\n\nThe quality of the writing, however, somehow pales in comparison to the way the world of Barry Lyndon is captured by Kubrick. The costumes are jaw-dropping. The set design and the cinematography, particularly the way natural light is used, are incredible. And the score is an all-time great. It shouldn't come as a great surprise, then, that the film won Oscars in all four of these categories. It was nominated for three others, and struck out-all three times for Kubrick himself, in Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nA film like this obviously needs a strong central performance to work, and Ryan O'Neal proves himself more than up to the task. While he's on his way up, he's naive but resourceful. On more than one occasion, he gets outsmarted, but these aren't situations he forgets easily. Every time he gets knocked down, he picks himself back up, but more importantly, he's sure never to get knocked down in the same way again. Once he reaches his pinnacle (shortly after marrying Lady Lyndon, who's also well-realized thanks to Marisa Berenson), he becomes sloppy. He's reliant on his mother to continue helping him move up, but a number of social and financial slip-ups cause him irreparable damage to his reputation, and after his absolute biggest personal setback-a tragedy, really, that occurs late in the film-he's a lost cause. In all this, however, O'Neal never loses sight of who Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon is: A man dissatisfied with ordinariness.\n\nSo despite being three hours long and about a seemingly unremarkable group of 18th-century European aristocrats, Barry Lyndon is captivating and amazing. It doesn't reach the impossibly high bar Kubrick set with 2001 and Dr. Strangelove, but it's unquestionably in the director's excellent second tier of films-films that would top almost any other director's filmography. Anchored by O'Neal and made all the better by Kubrick's unparalleled eye for detail, Barry Lyndon is the period piece every director dreams he or she could pull off, and it's something even skeptics of the genre should seek out. There isn't anything stuffy about this film. Its themes are universal, and its quality seems unmatchable.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/barry-lyndon-review/",

Maybe if Stanley Kubrick wasn't so in love with the source material and obsessed with his style than the substance wouldn't be sacrificed, and maybe if Leonard Rosenman wasn't so obsessed with proving himself than his soundtrack would match the dramatic structure of the film. However, the second act fixes these problems - the music becomes not a statement of Barry Lyndon's knowledge of classics, but instead a way to bring the emotion of the film to life. The story ceases to be a confused one, but instead has incredible emotional effectiveness. There is a scene involving the death of someone close to Barry which ranks as one of the most heart-wrenching sequences in film history.

Every person in this is loathsome, the cast of characters comprised of selfish opportunists, agentless and faceless aristocrats, pathetic children, and money-hungry peasants willing to sell their family members off for coin. Kubrick has dealt with these topics before, but here he very clearly imbues a unique, active contempt for human beings in general throughout, mocking their pathetic attempts at achieving some semblance of success in an unknowable world, synecdochally utilizing one man's rise and fall to exemplify this phenomenon. It works on a different field than his other films, but it's certainly no less masterful, boldly embracing nihilism and deconstructing life in a way as to warrant a place alongside his absolute best work.",

            "content": "After the release of \"2001 A Space Odyssey\", Stanley Kubrick had the power to finally make his pet project: A film about the life of Napoleon Bonaparte. After expending years researching and preparing for preproduction, Dino De Laurentiis released a film about the same topic -\"Waterloo\"- but it failed miserably in the box office, thus Kubrick´s financers pulled their funding thus killing what Kubrick described as \"I expect to make the best movie ever made\" (such a tragedy that this project never materialize). But in order to not waste all the preproduction work, Kubrick decided to make seventeen century period pace. \nRedmond Barry is an Irish teenager in 1750, who is in love with his cousin but due to some circumstances he is forced to leave his native land.\nMost film lovers agree that this period piece represents the \"fall from grace\" for Kubrick, as it is extremely weak compared to his remarkable resume. Are those statements true? \"Barry Lyndon\" counts with jaw dropping production that flawlessly recreates that phase of European history, it takes advantage of its long running time by telling a rich story, the slow pacing is the perfect choice as it gives you time to understand the character of Barry and to appreciate his world, a beautiful score, arguably Kubrick´s most beautiful cinematography as it recreates oil paintings of the time due to the flat perspective the camera lens provides, Kubrick´s ability to use lighting is at its peak with the use of natural candle lights, some of the characters are well defined, most of the acting is solid, the story may be the cliché \"rise and fall\" but the script is well written, the themes are solidly executed, the dialog is appropriate for the time period, an appropriate ending, and Kubrick´s directing is possibly his most perfectionist (only behind \"2001\"). As you can see \"Barry Lyndon\" has all the Kubrick trademarks but it truly represents a misstep in his career. This period piece has two colossal problems: Ryan O´Neil´s acting is so bland that it makes the character of Barry a hard one to understand, and the questionable narrating storytelling, because this is a character driven story but it is all \"tell don't show\". Those two problems are the reason why I consider \"Barry Lyndon\" a mistake in Kubrick´s career but sometimes the director´s mistakes are more interesting than his successes.\n\"Barry Lyndon\" represents the beginning of Kubrick´s latter career. While it is arguably his most beautiful film, and undeniably one of the most gorgeous looking films ever made, it is one of the weakest of his resume. It is a technological marvel but the storytelling and Ryan O´Neal are what destroy this potential masterpiece. I am a humongous Kubrick fan but I won't name a movie a masterpiece just because it has his name on it. A must see if you love Kubrick's work but just be warned this is misstep in his career.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nWith every master filmmaker, there will be films that would instantly grab you, a perfect specimen that would define one's perspective of the filmmaker and cinema in general, and there are films that are great but slightly pale when compared to the favourites. I may be one of the rare few who find Barry Lyndon to be a slightly lesser product than Kubrick's other works, but I am also not blind to the rationales of those who see this film as pure perfection.\n\nBarry Lyndon utilises the rise and fall storytelling that Kubrick has achieved wonderfully in films like Spartacus, Lolita, and A Clockwork Orange. In this style of storytelling it is most important for a film to contain a protagonist worthy of great attention; and Barry Lyndon, initially titled as Redmond Barry, is no exception. Kubrick has a fascination for individuals who are likeable but at the same time flawed, the only time his film has swerved from the norm is his conveyance of Spartacus, but even then he had very limited control and forced to tell its story and protagonist only through a positive light, becoming more symbolic than realistic. Barry Lyndon's story begins with the character full of innocence and hope, but at the same time also flawed, viewed as a child who is selfish and showing very little empathy for others aside for his mother. It is through this balance that the character rarely ever feels frustrating to follow, and prevents the problems that he carries to be over-dramatic. The situations he goes through during the first half of the film were sympathetic and interesting to watch, with each one allowing us to become closer to the character. It is also during this half of the film where most of the film's comedic tone lurks, but executed so in a manner that still retains the film's seriousness.\n\nThe second half of the film depicts Barry Lyndon's fall from his position of higher society, it details the many tragedies that he had to endure and act as a contrast of his once humble and innocent beginnings. It was during this aspect of the film that I started to find myself less and less interested in following his journey, it seemed to concern more the members that have been affected by his change rather than Barry Lyndon himself; he is the reason why I wanted to embark on this journey in the first place, and Kubrick's decision to distant the audience and view him from the perspective of the sympathised made me become aware of non-story related aspects of the film that I disliked, an example would be the film's slower pacing becoming much emphasised during this act of the film. Though emotionally distant from the character, there were a couple of moments that caught my attention, prime examples would be the final duel or the death that occurs within the Lyndon family; I wish they were abundant enough to keep the whole hour and a half fascinating.\n\nBarry Lyndon can be seen as a film that depicts the destructive nature of reality, breaking the innocence of youth and having to rely on deceitfulness in order to succeed. It was his virtuous actions early in the film that made him such a wonderful individual, but through those actions has further placed him in deeper to a situation he never wanted to be in the first place. It was only during the growing relationship of him and a professional gambler, eventually also his mentor, that he was able to escape. His mentor's influence on him begins to grow, executed subtly, introducing Lyndon to the life of the higher society, enticing him in wanting to climb the social ladder. He inserts himself to royalty with a cunning mindset and through opportunistic methods. From there, we start to see the titular figure fall, becoming consumed by the world that he desperately wanted to belong to, becoming entirely opposite of what he once was; a believer of true love and high morals. It was definitely interesting, but if only the process in the latter stages wasn't so tedious at times.\n\nKubrick's masterful strokes do not only lie in his characters but also in the settings and environment that surrounds them. Take a look at all of his films after Dr. Strangelove; they all convey their worlds with such distinctive beauty that it could easily become a character of its own, a subject on which one could dissect and find meaning of. Barry Lyndon achieves so greatly because of its distinctive beauty, recreating a previous world that we have once settled and admired. Kubrick maintains a sense of authenticity through the use of particular locations that geographically and visually connect with the film's story, shooting interiors with the use of candle lights and natural light passing through the windows, using only electrical methods of lighting as minimally as possible and only done so to capture that naturalism that Kubrick desired. What Kubrick ended up creating is a gracefully moving painting, capturing the glowing softness and beauty that many would recall of that time, mimicking the gorgeous paintings and art that capture the particular period. It is not only in the photography and lighting that captures this overall feeling, as elements from set design, costumes and props coming together to immerse its viewers of a long forgotten period.\n\nBarry Lyndon's grounded tone primarily comes from Kubrick's classical musical choices, intended to accurately capture the film's setting. Paired with other elements of the film's production, it immerses us into its world and story. The film's acting performances can at times come off as cartoonish, especially during the first hour of the film, but this was intended by Kubrick, to keep the film from coming off as too overbearing from its heavy drama, therefore the presence of the classical tracks kept the film from being too satirical.\n\nBarry Lyndon is a wonderful film that is only held back due to story and pacing elements during the second half of the film. It achieves brilliantly in capturing a particular time and place, immersing the audience in the process; Barry Lyndon may not seem much of a technological or visual achievement as his other films, The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and 2001: A Space Odyssey are notable examples, but it is no doubt innovative through brilliant methods of illumination and pairing them with slow but mesmerising zooms. It seems with every viewing, the film's visual beauty becomes more and more stunning, leaving a mark on my mind that stands along with the most beautiful films in all of cinema.",

Also, his long tracking shots, calmed zoom-outs, large cinematography and telescopic wide angles are also part of his awesome slowness. Barry Lyndon is a great story, adapted from a novel by a great writer, produced by a great producer and directed by a great director; all of them are the one and only Stanley Kubrick, and this film is one of his more beautiful ones.\n\nWhile the narrator can mostly be taken as \"Exposition Man\", the story still manages to be told well and with a pacing that it's both slow and normal on speed. Fast, it isn't, but that isn't a bad thing. Something I love from somewhat slow films is that they let you to breath into the world or the time period the film is, that way, you get more into the characters because you feel their world or time period. This is something very few films manage to do: Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey (another great Kubrick film), The first Hobbit movie by Peter Jackson; all these know how to tell a story and stop for some periods of time to let you live their world. Barry Lyndon is another great example of such slow story-telling.\n\nWhen talking about Stanley Kubrick, it's impossible not to mention his filmmaking techniques, and each of his movies uses the same ones, but in a different way; kinda like uploading the same photo over and over, but using a different Instagram filter on each upload. In Barry Lyndon, Kubrick filmed this in such a way that each shot is like a living painting from the 17th century. This is ingeniously made by the use of natural lightning and no electric lights at all. There are scenes with candles lights being the only source of lightning on the shot, making the film much more in tone with the historical period it's presenting. With Barry Lyndon, Kubrick created another innovating cinematography method that also serves as a form of story-telling for the film, something I can't recall seeing in another film.\n\nThis is why Kubrick was the master: he was inventive and new, and because of it, his films were never as great on their time, making Kubrick a genius ahead of his own time. Kubrick, I hope you are resting well in the eternity, as now you are one of the greatest directors of all time. Barry Lyndon is such a beautiful film...there are few words I can use to talk about it. When you see it, its greatness speaks for itself on each shot, on each part of the story, on each change of scenario. Another great example of cinematic greatness from Stanley Kubrick, one of my favorite directors of all time.",

The story revolves around an Irishman who gains and loses a fortune, and while it is 3 and a half hours long, I was rarely bored. In typical Kubrick fashion, Barry Lyndon contains some truly beautiful and surreal cinematography and music. It is also a very cynical movie. Kubrick doesn't focus much on the characters, and focuses more on the environment surrounding the characters. Even the narrator is cynical, revealing events in the plot before they even happen. I think the most cynical thing about this movie is how emotionless most of the characters are. Ryan O'Neal rarely has any emotion on his face, and while this would generally be a bad thing, this only adds to the greatness of the movie. Overall, this is a stunning, although slow at times, film.",

            "content": "Stanley Kubrick's 18th century epic tells the story of Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), beginning with his humble origins in Ireland right through to his rise into the aristocracy and ending with his eventual fall from grace. Barry begins with a passion for his cousin Nora (Gay Hamilton), which she is happy to reciprocate until she meets an English Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter). Barry challenges and kills the Captain in a duel and is then forced to flee from home. From Ireland, Barry ends up in Europe, fighting in the Seven Years (1756-63), with the British then the Prussians (long story!), before the opportunity for him to climb higher than ever in society comes along. \n\nBarry woos and marries the Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) and takes the new name of Barry Lyndon. After years of toil Barry is rich and has everything he could ever hope for. Though Lady Lyndon loves her new husband dearly, Barry has seen her as nothing but another rung on the social ladder and his infidelities, drinking and gambling become the mainstays of his life with no room for his wife. It's the idyll Barry has long dreamed of but he doesn't count on the hatred from Lady Lyndon's son, Lord Bullingdon (Dominic Savage), and as the years go by stepfather and stepson begin to lock horns constantly. Barry always has the upper hand while Lord Bullingdon is a boy but as he matures the stakes are raised and fierce battle lines are drawn from which only one man can emerge as the victor.\n\nKubrick's sweeping epic weighs in at three hours and requires a lot of commitment from the audience but it is a wonderful journey. The settings are breathtaking, the costumes fantastic and you will feel fully immersed in eighteenth century society. Barry's rise and fall is absorbing despite the change in his character. At the outset you will sympathise with the penniless Irish youth but will feel little towards the rich philanderer in the second half. O'Neal is both charming and ruthless in the lead but Barry Lyndon is all about Kubrick's vision and though it wasn't well received on initial release the film has deservedly earned many plaudits since.\n\nBarry Lyndon was the last of Kubrick's epics after Spartacus and 2001: A Space Odyssey and what a way to sign off. While the settings and costumes will stand in memory more than the characters, this is still an engaging film throughout and the classic rags to riches tale though Barry's fortune is destined to never last. The film's length may be off-putting to many but if you can look beyond that there is another classic Kubrick effort waiting to be discovered here.",

            "content": "In \"Barry Lyndon\" we have echoes of how Stanley Kubrick's great un-made project, a biopic of Napoleon, may have looked and felt. It would have been stately, as \"Barry Lyndon\" is throughout, with perfectly still shots that linger on faces, or very slow pans and zooms of impeccable, symmetrical sets. It would have been steeped in period details, as \"Barry Lyndon\" is with its Georgian turns of phrase (a high-society woman is \"a woman of great fortune and condition\"; to sympathize with another's circumstances is to be \"sensible\" of them) and the impressive mounds of powdered hair and layers of makeup on the men and women. Classical music would have abounded, as it does in most Kubrick films and no less so here. There would have been warfare on the continent in which soldiers marched against each other in tight, colorful ranks, and there would have been intriguing marital relations. The latter might have demanded more sustained attention in the hypothetical Napoleon film than it receives in \"Barry Lyndon,\" where the wife seems forever on the cusp of transmitting some insightful commentary but remains unsatisfactorily cipherous. Had Napoleon been made, its lead character would even have had a shockingly similar arc to Barry's considering their very different historical significances (incalculable in Napoleon's case, non-existent in the case of the fictional Lyndon). As it happened \"Barry Lyndon\" is the movie we have, and it is a very good one. No other Kubrick work received as many Oscars (four), all of these in recognition of the film's technical accomplishments. Yet among the director's many masterpieces it has had a relatively low public profile. Could calling it \"Napoleon\" have elevated it into the top tier of his oeuvre in the minds of many fans? The added aura of historical import would have helped, but probably not enough: though the film is very finely-wrought, it lacks the more obvious eye-popping abstractions of a \"2001\" or the overt improprieties of a \"Dr. Strangelove\" or \"A Clockwork Orange\" with which the name Kubrick is and was associated.",

Like Tarantino films have some of the best dialogue, Kubrick here has an excellent plot. Every scene feels necessary and is highly fresh, memorable, interesting, and powerful. I would not go into depth about any plot details, but the entire story is polished, well-formed, and layered. One of the main messages is that dishonesty and immorality can only lead you so far in life before you receive comeuppance. The story works in so many ways that you can make a modern day version of the film and it would be relatable. Clocking in at about three hours, the film will be long for most viewers, but I doubt that anyone will be looking at their watch. Kubrick described by many as an emotionally cold filmmaker is not afraid to write heartfelt and melancholic scenes.\r\n\r\nThe direction by Stanley Kubrick is filled with range. He directs a suspense in a scene and even adds a lot of emotion. Under Kubrick's steady hand, we can cry, and squeeze our armrests at the same time. For instance, the duel between Barry Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon makes us fear for Lyndon's safety while feel sad that Bullingdon has been so mistreated that he wants to kill his step-father. Also, Kubrick is also responsible for the spot-on portrayals given by his actors. You can not resist being immersed in every scene.\r\n\r\nThe actors all give wonderful performances and are pretty much on the same par. However, Ryan O'Neal ,who plays the title character , and Dominic Savage ,who plays the young Lord Bullingdon, have much more subtlety in their roles. Yes, most top-notch actors could bawl their eyes out on cue, scream, and completely go into the role, but it can feel at times over-acted. O'Neal and Savage are not in your face with their emotions, but you can still sense everything that they feel. I prefer the more realistic performances not that I dislike any of them.\r\n\r\nThe authenticity of the film is outstanding. All of the costumes and sets make you travel back in time. There was not a single moment where I doubted that I was in the 1700s. The score constituting of many classical music masterpieces is fitting. I would have preferred an original score, but in terms of adapted scores, this is one of the best. The cinematography by John Alcott is beautiful focusing mostly on the beautiful wide shots of landscapes or cities. The most interesting part about the editing is that it feels like an early Disney feature film with the use of a similar voice of the narrator and classic transitions between chapters of Barry's life.\r\n\r\nOverall, Barry Lyndon is one of the best, if not the best, period pieces of all time with perfect technical authenticity mixed with a wonderful story.",

The sets and costumes were spectacular. The cinematography of 18th century Europe was beautiful. The performances were pitch perfect. Most of all, I liked the score.

It's probably the least talked-about of his films these days, but it's still great in its own simultaneously grandiose and austere ways. Don't ever try to watch it when you're sleepy, though.\n\nThe film is an epic, 3-hour 18th-century period piece adapted from a picaresque novel by William Makepeace Thackeray. Like other picaresques, it doesn't really have a plot, but it does have a story: it follows the life of one Redmond Barry (later Barry Lyndon), who works his way up the social ladder almost by accident. Barry isn't a particularly noble or even interesting person; he's just some shmuck who happens to be in the right place at the right time, for the most part. \n\nKubrick films all of this with big, ornate compositions that remind one of 18th-century paintings; I found myself thinking about William Hogarth during a couple of scenes. In fact, the whole thing is kind of like a movie version of Hogarth's series \"A Rake's Progress.\" The exteriors are often grand and truly beautiful, and the interior night scenes were apparently filmed with actual candle light and nothing else. The film, which won the Oscar in its year for Best Cinematography, holds up better visually than almost any other 1970s film I can think of. The music, which also won an Oscar, is adapted from a wide variety of classical composers. This is definitely one of the most elaborate and technically interesting period pieces ever made.\n\nAnd yet the story is very deliberately told, about a character we are not particularly encouraged to care about, having a life that, the film seems to suggest, ultimately doesn't mean much. We know Ryan O'Neal was capable of expressive acting - he was in Paper Moon just two years earlier. Yet here, Kubrick seems to have encouraged O'Neal to portray a basically blank person with no character or personality. All of the film's grand, precise presentational formality contrasts with this seemingly empty narrative, in which many incidents occur, but none of them seem to contribute to any bigger pattern. That, no doubt, is the point, and in this way the film articulates Kubrick's cold, intellectual, anti-humanist point of view just as effectively as do 2001 and The Shining. It just does so in a very different way, with very different content, than either of those films do. Ultimately, this isn't one of my favorite Kubrick films by a long shot, but I can certainly see how it fits in to his body of work.",

            "content": "A duel to start and a duel to conclude.  With Barry Lyndon, Stanley Kubrick decides to make a one-film master class on how to make a period piece look authentic.  The story has an interesting, yet somewhat familiar two chapter structure, the first being the fun and the second being the descent.  The story is basically the unlikely journey of an ordinary Irishman to the upper echelons of 18th century European aristocracy, mostly through a series of duels.  The messages, if there are any, are that attempting to buy your way to the top won't necessarily make you happy, as well as you not knowing where life might take you.  The character of Barry Lyndon culminates in an impressively tense duel.  The acting is all great, though as an indication of my youth, delivered by actors who are no longer really widely known.  The largely Irish shooting locations were very convincing.  Come to think of it, everything in this film was pretty convincing, especially the visuals.  Cinematographer John Alcott captures beautiful European landscapes and low light interior scenes with equal ease.  Kubrick and Alcott using innovation to shun the use of electric lights greatly contributed to the film's very real look.  The high quality and beauty of the cinematography is one of the reasons why the film looks very timeless, even now at 37 years on.  The other visual factor is high quality costumes and sets, both looking high quality and completely authentic.  The score, compiled from various classical musicians is very appropriate, if loud at times.  With visual captivation and authenticity outshining the story itself, Barry Lyndon stands as one of Kubrick's more reserved epics. (19 October 2012)",

            "content": "To begin with I want to share two observations I made with you.\n\nFirst, if this film would have been made 30 years later, Heath Ledger would have been the obvious choice to play Barry.\nSecondly, Ryan O'Neal looks a lot like Val Kilmer (I wasn't aware of that).\n\nLet's start with O'Neal anyways. He's a rather atypical choice for a period costume drama and not a very Kubrick-esque choice either. He does a decent job though, although his performance neither stands out nor beats out any of the others in the movie. It was certainly helpful though that Mr O'Neal is partially fluent in German so he could pull of his German dialogue rather well (although I have no idea when Irish gentry learns German but it looks like everyone in 18th century Europe communicated in English or German - sry Stanley but they should talk French - a lot).\nThe first act of Barry's adventures reminded me of the great picaresque novels of former centuries (most notably - in German literature - Simplicissimus) and this is also the part of the film where you get scheming, gambling, duelling, fighting and I was thoroughly satisfied with all of that.\nThe second act though plays out more like a bad Jane Austen novel about dysfunctional aristocratic families (a genre I genuinely hate).\n\nNonetheless, Mr Stanley's visual style suits the latter half a bit better although the first half looks pretty amazing too. As I found out he decided to use as little artificial and electric light as possible thus a lot of (interior) scenes are just candle-lit. This makes some of the best-lighted shots I've seen in my film watching past. The score is also perfect for the genre and especially march music in the war scenes adds a cynical note.\n\nAll in all, I found it rather cynical indeed. Much of the cynism is brought to us by the narrator who tells the story in a funny and slightly amateurish way (as if he'd tell it to his children) - I don't know if this was intentional but it gave the whole film a rather unique mood.\n\nAlso, despite its 3-hour runtime I found it modestly paced especially considering its from the same guy who brought us 2001, The Shining and Spartacus which all can be ultimately described as slooooow.\nHere it's just that the story needs the three hours to be told and Kubrick didn't rush through it.",

            "content": "IDENTITY-The sixth of Kubrick's favorite subjects as forementioned by the booklet. \n\nPLOT:Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a simple, poor Irishman that lives with his aunt in 1700s Ireland and is in love with his cousin, Nora. When he gets in a duel over her with a British trooper, he's forced to flee his home; changing names and going through many hard events. Along the chain of events, he marries a rich lady named Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) and becomes a rich Irishman, but this is where the troubles of now-named Barry Lyndon rev up. All through his life, he tries to be a pampered gentlemen, but is that really what he's supposed to be? It is a simple plot executed to the finest degree of unpredictability. \n\nACTING:The acting is top quality. O'Neal does a brilliant job of Redmond. There wasn't a sour actor in here. The shiners were Gay Hamilton as Nora, Leonard Rossiter as Capt. Quin, Leon Vitali as Lord Bullingdon, and of coures Berenson as Lady Lyndon. \n\nSCORE:The score is mainly Irish music, but it's very well done throughout; even if it doesn't always fit the mood.\n\nCAMERAWORK:Like 2001, this Kubrick classic contains some of the finest, most beautiful camerawork as he captures the landscapes, emotions, and action. Even during the fast scenes, any shaky cam goes down not as mistakes, but nostalgia.\n\nOTHER CONTENT:Now, it is said in the booklet that Kubrick uses reverse psychology to make the audience wonder why Barry Lyndon is so important since there is a three-hour movie about him. The real truth behind this is that he's messing with his audience; Barry Lyndon is unimportant unless you find him important. \"Barry Lyndon is Barry Lyndon as BARRY LYNDON is BARRY LYNDON.\" I thought this was clever, but pointless, for it was slow and made you wonder: what did I just watch? The movie is cinematic magic, but it has no real idea to it; a pointless gem if you will. I also found it lacking in substance compared to Kubrick's previous films. But enough of the bad, let's get back to the good. The script is well-written and the scenes are tense from perfect build-up of suspense and release of emotion. \n\nOVERALL, a great Kubrick film with a perfectly unpredictable plot, top quality acting, well done score, beautiful camerawork, a well-written script, and perfect suspense build-up, but it lacks in substance through comparison and it's really pointless.",
