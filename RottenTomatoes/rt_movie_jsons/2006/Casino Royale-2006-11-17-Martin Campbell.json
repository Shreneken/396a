            "content": "Every now and again a new actor is brought in to revitalize the role of James Bond and, over the years, the results have been largely applauded with each successive actor inhabiting the character in a consistent, but subtly different way. Daniel Craig's premiere as the highly-stylish and intense action hero still enjoys his martinis, but allows for a more raw and relatable Bond than we've come to expect. Ditching most of the gadgetry that helped make the character famous, and instead giving us a Bond more reliant on himself than his \"deus ex machina\" wristwatch lasers or x-ray glasses, was a bold move that payed off immensely. Trading the high, world-ending stakes of films like Moonraker or Goldeneye for this much more plausible storyline was another switch that helped cement Craig's version of this timeless character. Casino Royale sees Craig's Bond playing poker in Montenegro on his first mission as a double 0 agent. Of course this isn't just any pickup game of poker. Instead, Bond is facing down a terrorist financer by the name of Le Chiffre (played with an excellently subdued evil by the wonderful Mads Mikkelsen) who is known for occasionally bleeding tears from his left eye (a move that is somehow campy and perfect at the same time). Bond teams up with Vesper Lynd (played with a haunted aura by Eva Green) in an attempt to bankrupt Le Chiffre through a high-stakes game of poker. While the synopsis seems subdued given the epic classic American cinema character of James Bond, it's really just a way of experiencing the expected Bond set pieces through the lens that's both grounded and stylized. What results is a Bond for the new generation. He's grittier, a bit more somber and vulnerable than past iterations in a way that allows an audience to feel for him as opposed to making him a bulletproof action god. The whole thing has an immediately different feel than the Brosnan chapters that preceded it; more human, more relatable and inarguably more watchable.",

            "content": "Daniel Craig fights and investigates his way to stardom as a brutal new James Bond.\n\nDirector Martin Campbell's spy thriller Casino Royale (2006) is a solid picture with tons of action sequences and intense situations. The hand to hand combat choreography and parkour chase sequences are exhilarating and fit Daniel Craig's fit and furious Bond. Campbell's direction can be gripping during conversations, but all the action starts to overload and bore me after minutes of endless chases. Stuart Baird's editing gets me lost in the chaos of the action, but I felt involved in the talking with his careful cuts during the conversations. I wish there was more espionage as I found the scenes of Bond looking for clues and contacts more gripping, but I guess they wanted a more modern action hero Bond. I do love that Casino Royale's biggest scene is one giant gambling table sequence of high stakes poker that's intricately plotted out.\n\nWriters Paul Haggis, Robert Wade, and Neal Purvis give us a few pithy one liners and a horribly convoluted story. I don't know nor care about the villain's motives or plan. I understand that Bond must win the poker game to stop Le Chiffre from getting money to fund terrorists, but that's it. It's all about Bond being young, inexperienced, ruthless, empathetic, and naive before getting coldhearted. Though Craig feels very angry, reckless, and emotional more than skilled or youthful. Casino Royale is a good movie with captivating casino gambling, exciting chases, as well as tense interrogation. Some of the dialogue is too on the nose to retroactively make Bond seem less sexist and self aware, but I've never felt like Bond needed major updating. Eva Green's Vesper Lynd being a well written and complex woman gives her Bond girl all the progression her character needed. Bond's banter with Vesper is charming and some of the best moments of Casino Royale.\n\nDaniel Craig's James Bond is more grounded than Pierce Brosnan's spy who could do anything, but similarly angry and serious like Timothy Dalton's incarnation of 007. He does not have the effortless flirtation skills of Sean Connery, nor Roger Moore's easy charming humor and romancing skills. I think James Bond should encapsulate every aspect of 007, but Craig leans heavier into the fights, chases, and smarmy quips. He excels at intricate poker playing and taunts. He keeps Casino Royale's 144 minutes moving along steadily. His getting in the shower with Vesper to console her after she witnesses him beat two men to death is very sweet and intimate. That shower scene is possibly Craig's best scene as James Bond. I think Craig's acting when 007 is poisoned trying to get the defibrillator working is fantastic in a gripping moment of suspense.\n\nI don't think producer Barbara Broccoli should have cast Daniel Craig as he's easily my least favorite James Bond. Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan are all far more memorable than Daniel Craig. He wants to be more serious, but he starts to feel humorless and not like an intriguing spy at all. The lack of spy gadgets and playful humor is sorely missed for Daniel Craig's James Bond. I don't need or want outrageous gadgets or sexist womanizing, but a few more spy gadgets and flirting would have been appreciated. Casino Royale is too bland. Phil Meheux's cinematography has stunning far wide shots of the environments, but Casino Royale's highlights are his striking close-up shots. The intimate shots of Daniel Craig and Eva Green are playful, expressive, and touching. I hate his hectic camerawork during the action though as I cannot follow it easily.\n\nDaniel Craig is sturdy as a fierce James Bond with brutal fights and suave gambling. I liked the intimate romance with emotional moments between Bond and Vesper. I never found Craig super dashing or charming unfortunately, but he's got some great moments in Casino Royale. Eva Green is breathtaking and sympathetic as Bond girl Vesper Lynd. Her hardened critiques of Bond's womanizing and killing are fun, while it's her forlorn looks and flirty remarks that stay with me the most. She really is lovely.\n\nMads Mikkelsen is creepy and cunning as Bond villain Le Chiffre. His skillful poker playing and hand tell are subtle acting cues and his bleeding eye is very unsettling. Mikkelsen is charismatic and captivating with a really evil and twisted villain. Giancarlo Giannini is interesting as Bond's shadowy Montenegro contact Ren\u00e9 Mathis. Judi Dench is funny and stern as M, while Jeffrey Wright is a neat Felix Leiter, CIA agent. Everyone else is forgettable.\n\nProduction designer Peter Lamont made a really lavish casino set with Simon Wakefield, Stefan Mily, Lee Sandales, Martin Kotek, and Karel Krejnik's exquisite furniture. Everything looks like gold.\n\nComposer David Arnold's score is tense with real energy to it. He helps build tension quickly. His symphonic music raises the stakes. I adore Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell's iconic alternative rock James Bond theme song for Casino Royale called \"You Know My Name.\" Sound designers Martin Cantwell, James Boyle, Eddy Joseph, James Harrison, Stuart Morton, Mark Taylor, Mike Prestwood Smith, Oliver Tarney, Jack Whittaker, and Mark Verner click poker chips and burst gun shots loudly for striking effect.\n\nThe only outfit more stunning than Eva Green's purple evening gown is her black lace dress with a plunging neckline from costume designers Lindy Hemming, Dan Grace, Hana Ku\u010derov\u00e1, Nicholas Roche-Gordon, and Patricie \u0160optenkov\u00e1.\n\nWhy is every man super sweaty in this film, you'd immediately think everyone was suspicious if they looked like they were constantly under spotlights. I hate Daniel Craig's sloppy spiked forward hair. He looks silly opposite Mad's particular side combed haircut that's short and slicked. Thankfully, Eva Green's dark black eyeshadow brings out her hypnotizing blue eyes and sultry black treses. Overall, make-up artists Paul Engelen, Linda DeVetta, Laura McIntosh, Lesa Warrener, Laura Schiavo, Kevin Alexander, Nuria Mbomio, Melissa Lackersteen, Chloe Meddings, and Hana Chylova did nice work for the ladies.\n\nIn all, Casino Royale is fabulously entertaining with raw grit and bloody violence. Daniel Craig captures a hard edged Bond with intense emotions unlike any other previous Bond, even though he's not my favorite 007.",

The film also marks the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel which was previously produced as a 1954 television episode and a 1967 satirical film. Casino Royale reboots the series and starts off with a kind of origin story, at least the origin of how he got his licence to kill and became 007. The movie is filled with homages to the ones that came before it and just having seen every bond within the space of a month I enjoyed picking them out and getting a little over excited especially when Bond meets Felix Leiter. Craig is a very credible and tough Bond. Brutal and cold, like a killing machine, determined to get the job done but can turn on the charm if he needs to. Starting at the beginning of his double O career allows us to see a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond. He's much more reckless and gritty and really pushes his mind and body to the limit. A change was needed from the cartoonish fantasies the Pierce Brosnan Bonds had become, and this is definitely a step in the right direction. With intense action, frenetic and well shot chase scenes, particularly the ones on foot. Perfectly paced and utterly cool. Smartly written, stylishly directed and well acted. Great bond girl, if not one of the best and a great villain. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",

            "content": "(August 30th, 2022) Five months and 17 days ago, I watched this movie for the first time, and it was my introduction to the FANTASTIC universe of James Bond. As Daniel Craig's saga was kind of a reboot in the official franchise, as \"Casino Royale\" is an origin story of James Bond and also the first book written by Ian Fleming in 1953, I thought it was a good idea to start my journey in 007 films by Craig era. I loved that universe, and this experience motivated me to watch all the 007 franchise, from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan. And I still had a ritual, watching these films only on days finished in 7 (7, 17 and 27 of each month, from April 7th to August 27th, one or two movies per day). This franchise is not perfect, there are fantastic entries, like \"Goldfinger\" and \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", and there are mediocre and bad ones, like \"The Man With the Golden Gun\" and \"The World is not Enough\", but the universe, the world-building, and especially, the main protagonist, which was the best thing in almost all productions, made each second of this journey worth. All this time to finally return where it all began. In March, when I watched \"Casino Royale\" for the first time, I gave it five stars, but I was a complete \"noob\" in this universe, it was an introduction for me; five months later, I don't THINK this is my favourite 007 movie, I AM SURE. This is the film that fully understood who James Bond is from the first to the last second. The noir hook is fantastic, it perfectly introduces a Bond pre-00, and this scene is almost at the same level as Sean Connery's first appearance in \"Dr No\". The opening scene is also jaw-dropping, it's BY FAR the best of the whole franchise, and the most different as well (forget about female bodies dancing sensually, the opening here follows the main theme of the film: a casino game); I like the traditional openings, but this one has a special place in my heart, and it's crowned with which is, again by far, the best Gunbarrel sequence of all films. The film maintained one of the few good things of Pierce Brosnan's era: Judi Dench as M. I simply can't describe how much I love her character. Eva Green as Vesper Lynd is not only the best Bond girl ever, as she is pretty, intelligent and fundamental to the plot, but she also has the best arc a Bond girl could ever have; I loved how she starts, and I loved how she ends. I praised the train scene in my former review of this same film, and now that I have a context of all 007 movies and who is James Bond's persona, this scene becomes even better. In a later scene, we also have a small reference to \"GoldenEye\" in a dialogue. But a good Bond movie needs to have a good villain, and Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is on the podium alongside Silva (\"Skyfall\") and Goldfinger (seriously?). He is imposing, terrifying, mathematical, and a tremendous poker player, a worthy opponent. Talking about poker, in my March review, I said that this film made me want to study poker; I had this feeling again, the game scenes are hypnotizing, and I even think I paid more attention now than in my first watching. Don't wait for that agile Bond from previous times, this one is inexperient, makes mistakes, takes hasty decisions, and even almost dies. The classical elements like the Aston Martin, the \"shaken, not stirred\", and the \"Bond, James Bond\" are all here, but introduced little by little, as the universe is being rebuilt. And Daniel Craig, even with only one movie, shows that he's the most human James Bond of all, even more than Timothy Dalton. Oh, and the action scenes are excellently filmed. And the ending is to put a smile on everybody's face. I LOVED EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF THIS MOVIE! Five stars is still a low grade.",

This is one of the more serious entries and I absolutely love that. Daniel Craig is fantastic in the role. Not my favourite bond, not even in my top 3, but he's still really good. All of the official actors that played the character brought something to the role that none of the other do quite as well. Craig has the best run. He just does. I hadn't notice before, and thought he only started doing this in his later films, but he mutters here too. It is a negative, I am unable to sometimes make out what he was saying if not for watching with subtitles. Vesper is a fantastic Bond girl, but if there were any negatives I have for this otherwise masterpiece it is that Bond falling in love with her felt a bit fast-forwarded. Not too forced, in the end, it still is believable, I just needed a bit more time with them together.\n\nMads Mikkelsen is absolutely intimidating as the villain Le Chiffre.

While it certainly got tiresome after a while, Craig's more realistic and Anti-Fun Loving take on Bond certainly helps make this movie feel like an entirely different beast than those from before, and one that you could genuinely take seriously.  Craig's performance is a strong dramatic one, and he does have the gravitas required to carry a movie with this dark and aggressive of a tone.  The main problem with the movie is that it just feels endless; I remember watching this in numerous 30 minute chunks and even then I was feeling the weight of it.  If you like a more serious tone with your Action movie, then Casino Royale is certainly going to deliver - it's not as ambitious as Batman Begins, the movie that it clearly took inspiration from (that being the \"Gritty Reboot\" of a franchise), but it's certainly good at what it does, for the most part.",

In a post-9/11 era, when imperial might has been politically castrated, when the seeming seamlessness of technological advancement gives the lie of a smooth realism, Bond in turn must be castrated at every turn. Don't mistake me: I don't mean to long nostalgically for some mythical manliness, only that the earnest grit and saturation of this version is just as structurally masculine without any subversive or performative winks, a turn that is more prescriptive and authoritarian (just like the rest of the contemporary West).",

            "content": "Casino Royale is such a big disappointment when it comes to an extensive action flick as the film loses itself in various aspects of the film. The major problem with this movie is that the PG-13 rating is holding it back. Several components needed the R rating so it would feel more fleshed out. One of those features being the story. While the story isn't entirely in disharmony, it is not sufficient for a movie that runs over the 120-minute mark. The simplistic plot drags on for too long with so many sluggish scenes. For instance, the poker scene goes on way longer than it should have. The filmmakers knew this, as the awkwardly positioned heart attack scene diminishes the sequence as a whole. Furthermore, the tone of the movie is just off in general. The film tries to be this edgy spy thriller but never gets close to it with this PG-13 rating. The identity of this film is similarly off as it does not feel like a spy movie. The basic plot is moderately decent, but it doesn't warrant an approximately 150-minute runtime. There are numerous scenes in the film where it feels like Martin Campbell is trying to make a narrative that James Bond is this top-notch agent who has the cockiness that everyone loves. Yet, it is never thoroughly achieved in Campbell's vision. The closest the film ever gets to feeling like a spy movie is the opening scene. It is simplistic yet has this sophistication with the black and white filter and that gruesome fight. From that point on, the film loses the spy aspect throughout the rest of the movie. The saving grace of Casino Royale is the cast. Daniel Craig does a substantial job at portraying James Bond, and it feels like he is putting his own essence into the role, so Craig is not playing a typical spy. While Vesper's story was poor, Eva Green does a solid job in the film. Mads Mikkelsen is the most ineffective in the cast as he does very little trying to stand out in the ensemble. His character arc is not well-constructed, and Mikkelsen does not fix it with his performance. As for Jeffrey Wright and Judi Dench, they were excellent in this film. Both added some much-needed variety to the action flick. Before wrapping it up, the last feature of the film that was deeply hard to look at was the visual effects. The visual effects were not the best as some scenes contained visual effects that would be inadequate for anyone watching the movie. Yes, the movie came out in 2006. However, plenty of films had excellent visual effects and CGI that had releases dates before this movie. Casino Royale is a consequential, jumbled mess that runs on for too long as it tries to make a simple story complex. With the R rating holding the film back, Martin Campbell's vision never reaches its ample capacity. The acting is the only feature saving this movie from the tedious mess that it is. A supposed energetic action-thriller is actually an undeveloped snoozefest. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",

James Bond is easily one of the most iconic characters in movie history and the longest running franchise of a British spy working for MI6 who faces numerous dangerous villains around the world. Daniel Craig is James Bond in this one and he is incredible bringing the bravado, machismo, suave looks and his appetite for women that we know from Bond. Alongside him is veteran British actress Dame Judy Dench who returns as M from the pierce brosnan franchise. Mrs Dench is exquisite as a no nonsense lady who cares about Bond and sees him as her best agent but is constantly frustrated by his arrogance and theatrics. Mads Milkensen as the villain is good here but quite underwhelmed for a bond villain yet the torture scene with Craig truly brings the sadism that Milkensen brings to his villainous roles. The script is well written and weaves a story of intrigue, trilling action, government spying and crime fighting and sexy moments that make this film a sophisticated action film of a kind that we no longer see from Hollywood sadly and began Craig's journey as James Bond.",

Intellectually directed and written to boost start the supposably early flare seemingly embodied by Craig's suitable performance of building up Bond's experience that brightened his stardom, but the film seems to be better enjoyed by those who were repeatedly captivated after each film of the long-running franchise of cinematic maintenance based on literature. Engaging entertainment though with thrilling action pieces and intelligence, just not enough to persuade to go back and forward. (B+)",

            "content": "Austin Powers destroyed the old James Bond franchise by taking most of the elements of the classic James Bond films and amplifying them just enough to make them absolutely hilarious. In order to set itself apart from that era, Casino Royal marks a significant departure from the traditional approach to a Bond film, reinventing Bond in a way that is much closer to the character described by Ian Fleming in his original books. Daniel Craig drew significant criticism when it was announced he would replace Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, but from the opening scenes of Casino Royale it becomes clear why he was the right choice. Craig's Bond is gritty, tough and brutal - the sort of characteristics you might expect from an authorised killer. Gone are the pithy one-liners and silly gadgets. This Bond gets his hands dirty with much more violent hand-to-hand combat than his predecessors. The choice of black and white for the opening sequence is clever: it is a nod to the classic spy films of the 1960s, like The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, as well as to underscore to the viewer that this will be a very different Bond film. Martin Campbell's direction is more cinematic than the previous Bond films, with lots of sweeping camera moves and pacy editing that fits the action. Eva Green is excellent as the smart, self-assured British treasury employee Vespa Lynd, another departure from Bond traditions in terms of the stereotypical Bond girl. Casino Royale is so different that is easy to forget this is a Bond film, but Judi Dench plays a crucial role in grounding the film within the Bond franchise, returning as the smart, authoritative MI6 chief \"M\". The storyline is initially hard to follow, particularly in the first act, but becomes clear as the film progresses. There are some great action sequences and enough intrigue to keep your attention right until the end of the film.",

The movie is a bit too long though. The poker scene drag on a lot and as someone who doesn't understand poker, it made it even worse and it just felt weird to progress from Bond being tortured to Bond and Vesper making out a lot. They definitely could've handled the tone better in the third act.

From the overly campy and over-the-top nonsense that was Die Another Day (2002), a serious reboot was needed. In Casino Royale we were provided the perfect antidote to the stale silliness we had been served up for years on end. We get a much darker and grittier incarnation of 007 here that is much closer in keeping with the original source material.\n\nIn the spirit of a great reboot and reset of the series, everything is stripped back to the bone here. Bond is on his first assignment as a 00, there's no fancy gadgets, and the violence is visceral and up close as opposed to detached and almost meaningless in earlier films. Bond is also more emotionally vulnerable here, we see some of that remaining humanity he has inside before it is all stripped away by the end of the film. We see the formation of a cold and ruthless instrument of the government right before our eyes.\n\nChris Cornell's 'You Know My Name' has to be one of the strongest Bond themes and I love how musical motifs from the main song are used throughout the film.\n\nMy only problem with this film is that it's slightly too long, with the last part of the film feeling separate from the rest.

I have no issue with the quippy remarks that aren't necessarily realistic, that's just part of the bond charm. I take issue with normal conversations being awful for the sake of trying to pay homage to the originals. With that being said the action scenes and the story are what shine here.

That honour goes to Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig. Sean Connery was exceptional in the role from the early 1960's but these films are very much of their time.\u00a0\n\n\"Casino Royal\" takes the Bond premise and redefines the character. Like Timothy Dalton's more dark edgy Bond, Daniel Craig also removes the silliness of the previous few films and relies on the man to the job rather than ridiculous gadgetry. I much prefer the darker, grounded element both these actors brought to the role of James Bond.\u00a0\n\n\"Casino Royal\" takes us on a character building journey. How Bond becomes the agent he \u00a0aspires to be. The mistakes made , the lessons learnt and the emotions felt are all explored in this brilliant story. It also has one of the best villains in Le Chiffre ( \u00a0Mads Mikkelsen ) and Daniel Craig is magnificent in his first outing as Bond.\u00a0\n\nThe title song \"You know my name\" performed by Chris Cornell sets the mood and tone of the film as a gritty , dark \u00a0cinematic experience to come. This shows the thought process and detail the filmmakers went into when redefining the franchise. \u00a0\n\nOverall \"Casino Royal\" is the place to start for newcomers to the world of James Bond \u00a0without having to look back. The 1970's and 1990's were not the best time periods for the franchise as the agent seemed to enter a world of slapstick and almost superhero gadgetry. The gritty, dark, more grounded \u00a0Bond, played by Timothy Dalton in the 1980's, was undermined somewhat by his successor in the role, \u00a0particularly in the last two of the Pierce Brosnan films. \u00a0Therefore in\u00a0conclusion, \"Casino Royal\" is a far superior James Bond film than anything previous and sets the bar very high for further entries into the franchise.",

It works very well as an origin story for James Bond that has him making mistakes and being too quick to make rash decisions. All of which makes for a much better and more fascinating observation of his character. Daniel Craig is amazing as he's been in just about every movie I've seen him in. He plays the stone cold killer side of Bond as well as the human side very well, showing no matter what he does he is still just a man. The love story isn't forced and really has a place in the story without overwhelming it. The action is just great, and not overused so to take over the movie but instead spread out to make the dramatic scenes more impactful and make for a complete narrative. All this to say, I loved it.

James Bond is put on a mission by his boss M, to stop a mad terrorist from using money for very suspicious matters by beating him in a game of poker. The film starts out in a very suspicious way, as it should with the fact that it is a spy picture. Precisely apprehensive music plays at the beginning of the picture. A man by the name of Dryden goes up an elevator and he himself looks apprehensive as he goes up the elevator. He looks as if he almost knows that Bond is going to kill him because he has betrayed Bond, and he also looks authentically frightened as well. We are told what kind of film it is at the beginning not just by what kind of music plays but also with what happens at the beginning. \n\tThe traditional gun barrel sequence and montage that is presents in all Bond flicks is done during the introduction. A more modern and creative technique is done for the gun barrel sequence. The montage is done in a precisely unique way by mixing animation in with action or choreography and playing a genuinely upbeat melody. \n\tCasino Royale aside from being an authentically suspenseful film has great action and choreography, which make it a solid action film. An example would be a scene in which James Bond is chasing after a terrorist by the name of Mollaka, and they end up fighting on a crane that's moving, and there is beautiful cinematography with the camera moving around the crane showing them fighting. Mollaka and Bond jump from one crane to the next as well in this exhibition. \n\tAnother example of action in the motion picture is when Bond is chasing after another terrorist named Carlos and he's holding on to the top of a truck as he drives it. They also end up fighting in the truck, which is an example of more choreography and there's also an explosion. \n\tThe picture isn't just known for it's action, suspense, cinematography, and it's notion that it always advices you to pay attention not just with it being a spy film but with the notion that it keeps you males in particular paying attention with the many pretty ladies that are displayed, in it even the one's that have minor roles such as one that has a role of a receptionist and this sort of thing is in other Bond films as well but also for its solid acting. \n\tThere is plenty going on with Daniel Craig's face when he plays Mr. Bond. When Craig gets in a serious fight with a man at the beginning of the film and he knocks him out he breaths really hard thought his nose, and he looks at him like he's above him and he pities him and he's disgusted with him because of what he's done. \n\tNear the end of the film when a lady that he gets romantically involved with named Vesper Lynd is getting tortured his eyes looks like they have plenty of fear in them, and he's breathing authentically hard and sweating a whole bunch too as if his heart is beating really fast even as fast as it has ever beaten and we wonder if he's going to have a heart attack at this moment in the film. \n\tWhen Mads Mikkelsen who plays Le Chiffre the antagonist in the film is yelling he yells in a tone in which is a normal tone in which someone would yell in during this exhibition, and he sweats and sounds as if he's very insecure of himself during this scene as he's supposed to due to what Bond says. Jeffrey Wright plays Felix Leiter in an inducible stable way particularly during the poker scene in the film when he looks at Le Chiffre in an extremely mean way after he's found out what he's done to Bond, and the way he looks at him also looks very tough as if he could even take him out himself. Eva Green also gives a fine performance as Bond's love interest Vesper Lynd. When James Bond talks to her she looks right in his eye's as if she knows she can trust him equally during a scene in which he doesn't believe she can trust him. \n\tI give Casino Royale a 10 out of 10 considering that it's not just know for it's well done action scenes and suspense as plenty of Bond films are but also largely due to its acting and that it's the best Bond film since Goldfinger with the best Bond actor since Connery.",

This is my favorite Bond and all of the other ones have a formula to them and this one breaks the Bond mold and formula and cliches of the previous movies for good and this is a Bond that is more human and grounded. This movie really changed Bond like Batman Begins changed Batman to be more realistic and Casino Royale changed Bond to be more realistic and human and relatable. This movie has some of my favorite one-liners in all of cinema. This movie also has my favorite frame in all of film with Daniel Craig holding a phone and a rifle at the end of the movie it looks so epic.\n\nThe acting in this movie is very good and I think that Daniel Craig is the best actor that has played Bond and he gives the best performance of all of the other Bonds that have played before him. The chase/action sequences in this movie are my favorite. The beginning chase sequence is my favorite chase in all of cinema and Daniel Craig is chasing Sebastien Foucan the founder of free running. They also never use CGI it is all practical effects which is very impressive, in one scene where a car flips, it flips seven times setting the world record for most car flips in any movie. The cinematography is the best in the Bond franchise the way they use the lighting in one sequence is outstanding and the color grading and film grain look fabulous. The script and dialogue is amazing and like I said before the one-liners are amazing. This movie has my favorite score in cinema when Daniel Craig says the iconic line \"The names Bond, James Bond\" the iconic score kicks in and it makes that amazing scene so much better. His arc in this movie and in the next movies is one of my favorite arcs in film and we see the beginnings and the ends of 007. The way they create tension in this movie works so well even in the poker game they create tension and it works so well. The story had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and it is so engaging and gripping and it is just so entertaining. Overall it is my absolute favorite movie and I would recommend it to anyone especially if you love James Bond.\n1000%\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udf82",

Watching it again and again in the span of a decade I still can find amazing things every time I hit the play button. I grew up with Brosnan's Bond but after seeing this movie without a doubt Daniel Craig is absolutely the best version of 007 so far, I love Craig portrayal in this movie and he always gives an amazing performance in every scene he's in, combine it with the Villain, Bond Girl and other characters in this instalment that are just as amazing as another aspect around it. The camera work and the stunt is one of the best things I've ever seen in an action movie, not to forget the cool animation played with the soundtrack in the opening of this movie performed by late Chris Cornell. The story is also one of the best and darkest in the franchise which giving an epic journey with some heartbroken turn, even the ending in this movie is still giving me chills down to my spine until now.

He is excellent in the role.\n\nMads Mikkelsen makes for a grand villain, certainly one to be remembered. Eva Green brings a good dynamic to Bond's female lead, while it was pleasing to see Jeffrey Wright; I always enjoy watching him.\n\nThe plot is entertaining, I was thoroughly locked in during the poker scenes in particular. With that noted, the ending to this film is what marks it down for me. It concludes the main premise nicely, but the other parts felt like an add-on - which are finished a bit too sharpish.\n\nThat is my only negative, as the rest is very good.

Though, the main villain(s) were a bit underdeveloped and the movie left us at a cliff-hanger. Some died a bit too fast, IMO.\n\nSome things still did break my suspension of reality. Why is such a high-stakes poker game have such lax security? Vesper can walk up to Bond while he's playing. Bond can walk away from the game uninterrupted for hours. People are found murdered and kidnapped but security/police is not alerted despite the clientele at the game.\n\nBut besides that, I'm glad the film does great justice to its source material.\n\n4/5.

It's still an invigorated, relevant, creative and sure-footed franchise at this point; every frame and every scene has a myriad of little details that flesh out the world, and make the film feel grounded even though it hits the franchise-high notes of spy-fantasy.\n\nA brazen, brutish, excessive Bond film reboot that I have almost nothing more to say about than has already been written. \n\nThe decision to use previous reboot director Martin Campbell is welcome and clever and the holdover of Judi Dench as M is as obvious as it is surprising.\n\nArt house flourishes; the snapshot in the cut of the section chief's family photo as he's shot, a creatively integrated gun barrel sequence, the Bond-to-CCTC camera cut, and more, elevate the material and prove it as something different.\n\nMads Mikelson is such a menacing and out-there newcomer at the time that it's hard to remember that he's just a banker and not a maniacal evil villain which is a strength. And with Mr. White, the film manages to build a franchise without ever looking like it's trying to.\n\nThe film is bloated and the running time and sheer variety in it makes it a film not just easily put on, but as a flagship evening film with buddies, it has all the whizbang action and badassery and all the clever stings of dialogue you can smirk about.\n\nBut overall it ticks basically every box and is still, almost ten years later, a hallmark of the action summer blockbuster genre. The sumptuous music, the sharp editing, the electric photography, the enrapturing and devilish Eva Green, and the hard, dead eyes of Craig's broken Assassin make it a film to remember and to heartily recommend.\n\nBonus opening credits review: Aptly taking Bond into the videogame age and using the mocap to spice up the notion of watching a film that will revolve around a card game is clever. The lack of exploited women enforces the masculinity of this iteration and makes it feel a little sports gamey. The cheesy music is the right kind of cheesy as opposed to the cringey \"00\" bullet holes and 'status approved' cheesiness that is eventually saved by that ice cold walk into the light and steely blue eyed look as a focal point of Craig's Bond.\n\nSomeone needs to bring Campbell and Baird back to the franchise.",

I prefer him to Sean Connery because Connery's Bond was a bit pervy, whereas Craig's Bond seems more realistic - he's more cold (as an assassin should be), but he's fit and has style/charm. The script is miles better than the majority of the previous films. The plot is actually believable/realistic, there are no silly weapons, the villain is solid, and the action is some of the best in the entire franchise - the opening parkour sequence was great. My only complaint would be that some of the cinematography could have been more smooth rather than contains cuts/shakes, but it's far from the worst shaky cam. Finally, the soundtrack and opening song were great. It's a very enjoyable film that's well worth a watch.",

A lot. And keeping toe to toe with the ever-changing show business, he has quickly managed to grasp the essence of the crisp that this generation craves for. But mind you, it still doesn't make Martin Campbell, the director, the finest of all. In fact, looking at the 1-0-1 criteria of filmmaking, he may be able to JUST qualify as one. Let's take the Airport chase sequence, for instance. First of all it's one smooth ride, with all the elements of the scene mapped out neatly on the screen where its fast and gritty choreography makes the best of the run. Now as far as this was concerned, it is actually Campbell informing us with news, dry news.\n\nWhat it fails to capture majorly, is the momentum of all the action. It's not that we don't get it, we are just asked to reach out for it, it isn't served us up front on the table. If these are its cons, then pros have to be the performances and the cast. But quickly before we sink into Daniel Craig's thunderous blue eyes, another thing Campbell places elegantly in the film, is how the time has passed in any circumstances, the selected highlights in both the narration and execution are subtle and exhilarating.\n\nSo now, Craig.. should we just gaze at him or appreciate his exceptionally powerful scene with Mads Mikkelsen as he tortures him brutally. The humor that has been questioned many a times is twisted and turned so beautifully in here that even a worthy one-liner doesn't make us laugh but leaves a jarring dramatic impression on us. Eva Green with her love track doesn't have that amount of electricity in her romance as that poker table does which ironically is negatively motivated, something that the theme of Casino Royale shares.",

It gave the franchise a much-needed facelift when Pierce Brosnan had run out of 007 gas and the series was crying for a contemporary badass hero we could all look up to and drool over. Craig hits the mark on all accounts and is joined by a star-studded cast of darlings of the silver screen (Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench) in a dizzying plot drenched with energy that feels like witnessing the birth of a new, action-packed, glossy universe to host Bond's 21st century adventures. Even though Ian Fleming's novel precedes the film by more than 50 years, the script does a great job of adapting the story for the modern tug-of-war between political and business power plus the seductive, glamorous forces at play in this new saga. The casino and high-stakes poker tournament symbolise the tension superbly, and the game sequence sustains anticipation and is as engrossing as any of the dramatic action filling Bond's mission with misfires and intrigue. This is James Bond 3.0 - blonde, calculating, ruthless and unstoppable in his cold charm, table tricks and devastating one-liners. \n\nSource: https://bojoko.com/stories/gambling-movies/.",

Although there's nothing in Casino Royale that will exclude teenagers, this 007 is aimed squarely at adults. The November release date is also perfect - the film is almost too dark and serious for the kind of lighthearted, mindless fun we associate with summer blockbusters. The action is amazing but brutal(gone are the clean kills associated with Dalton or Brosnan) and many times Bond gets his ass handed to him which feels real.

Daniel Craig owns the screen in an Oscar worthy performance as Bond.

Craig is certainly the most physical Bond, and this film focuses on really raw, intense and realistic action sequences.  It's one of the best Bond films.

I buy the romance between Vesper and Bond, and it does a good job of showing that 007 is a very tragic figure, and will never have a happy or normal life. I honestly don't have much criticism for this film. I also really like how they modernized the gunbarrel sequence in the intro, followed by Chris Cornell's \"You Know My Name\" ( which, in my opinion, is the best Bond song to date) Badass movie.",

Bond being objectified this time around is an interesting choice that, although at times excessive, mostly worked in the film's favor as did Daniel Craig's more humanized portrayal of the character and his inexperience as an agent. The film is overlong and the romance arrived way too late in the game, but still this is an engaging, frequently even touching and very interesting Bond film that ended up being mostly a successful experiment.",

With the atrocity that was Die Another Day, it seemed like the 007 franchise had been destroyed. People doubted Craig, saying he didn't look the part. It didn't take long to prove them all wrong in just what might be the best action movie of the 2000s.\n\nThe character has been stripped of his gadgets, suaveness, even his prettiness, and turned into a violent, troubled brute who must use his training and dogged determination to succeed. Gone is the campiness of the Moore and Brosnan eras, or the professionalism that Connery and Dalton displayed. The film opens in black and white, reminiscent of film noir, and sets a proper tone: espionage is no longer as glamorous as it once seemed. If one wanted to get into the franchise, this would be the perfect place to start, as it is the origin story of the secret agent.\n\nOf all the actors, Craig probably delivers the best Bond performance. He displays a level of psychopathy not seen since Sean Connery in Dr. No, but gradually becomes more humanized as the picture progresses, with various elements coming together to fully form the iconic spy we know. \n\nThe supporting cast also does a great job. Eva Green provides a complex turn as Vesper, one of only two women Bond truly falls in love throughout the whole series. Mads Mikkelsen isn't given too much to work with as Le Chifre, but it's also nice to see that the villain is humanized here too. He's not a maniac set of world domination, but a man pushed into a corner who must do what he can to survive. \n\nThe film has some fantastic set pieces such as the Madagascar parkour chase, the poker game, a certain excruciating torture scene, and the climatic fight in some crumbling Venice apartments. David Arnold's score harkens back to the work of John Barry on the early Bond films, and the underrated theme song by Chris Cornell adds to the impact.\n\nBy turning 007 into a human being and portraying him in an air of moral ambiguity, the filmmakers have made the right choice. It's a strong contender for best Bond flick of them all, and even if it's not, it's at least top three.",

Casino Royale is not only good as a Bond film, but as an independent spy film in its own right; it's a delightfully dark twist on the Brosnan age gimmicks, grounding this new Bond in reality, with Daniel Craig assisting in a striking performance of the 00 agent. The film takes a riveting pace, with captivating action sequences around every corner and a script so quick if you blink you won't know what's going on. The supporting cast is also largely good as well, with Eva Green Bond-girling wonderfully as Vesper, providing more depth and sincerity than one might expect and Judi Dench continuing to play M with delightful coldness. Bond's adversary Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelsen leaves a lot to the imagination, settling as a sub-standard villain in an above-standard film. The film also suffers from being overlong, with a slightly lengthy build-up, that results in, despite effective writing and direction, a lingering pace issue towards the end of the film. Far too long was spent in that sanatorium that's my point. Largely, however, Casino Royale is a fantastic thriller, devoid of that irritating glamour so captured by previous Bonds, and grounding the character in a scarily familiar reality, that provides for surely one of the best Bond films of all time.",

            "content": "From out of nowhere comes this 'series reboot' of the 007 franchise that seeks to explain the Bond -hitherto very thin- backstory. As such, Casino Royale thankfully has very little to do with the late '60s comedy (or the 1950s tv production featuring an all American Jimmy Bond). It is a slick adaptation of the Fleming story with liberal doses of sub-plotting and a shift from its cold war environment to the contemporarised Islamic terrorist-funded world of 2006. Director Martin Campbell has done a fine job with this film, re-inventing 007 as capably as he did with GoldenEye a decade earlier. Gone are the cringeworthy double-entendres, gimicks, gadgetry,and formulaic storylines. In their place is a tough, occasionally smirking blonde Bond played with a steely conviction by English actor Daniel Craig, matched with a story about betrayal. French actress Eva Green is stunning as double agent Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelsen makes a creepy, disturbing villain with one eye that weeps blood (usually when he's losing a high stakes game of poker). I have shaved the fourth star down to a half simply due to the fact that it is also a very long movie (longer than it needs to be) and some of the action sequences (while brilliantly staged) could have used some culling in the editing process but that said, it's one of the best Bond movies in years.",

            "content": "Rebooting a film franchise can often come across as an act of desperation: an admission that the characters or story have been taken as far as they can possibly go, and a cynical means of luring in a new generation on the pretence of giving them ownership over 'their version' of a property. Perversely, the more successful a given reboot is, the easier it seemingly becomes to pull this same trick again the second that a particular instalment mildly underperforms. It may seem hard to believe in an age of cinematic universes where knowledge of superhero continuity is a badge of honour - but then we remember that Spider-Man and Superman have both been rebooted twice in the space of a decade.\n\nDie Another Day marked the Bond series' 40th anniversary in the most deeply disappointing way possible, serving up a glorified greatest hits compilation which played out like reheated leftovers. Faced with its deserved critical kicking and Pierce Brosnan's subsequent departure, the guardians of the series must have felt that starting from scratch and going back was the only way forward. Casino Royale is a worthy exception to the rule that reboots are pointless and underwhelming, delivering just the sort of reinvention that the franchise needed. It may even be the best film in the entire series.\n\nPart of the secret behind the Bond series' longevity is that it has always adjusted its character and storylines to the culture and politics of a given period. Sometimes it has done this so nakedly that the films in question date badly, whether it's Live and Let Die's attempts at aping Shaft, The Man with the Golden Gun cashing in on Enter the Dragon, or Moonraker trying and failing to be the next Star Wars. Often Bond has been at his best when he acknowledges his mortality and the world changing around him, while retaining the character elements which made him so popular in the first place. Goldeneye made a big deal about the Cold War ending, but it still felt like a story in which Bond had a rightful place.\n\nThe spectre hanging over Casino Royale, and indeed all of the Daniel Craig era, is the Bourne series. The first three films shifted the goalposts of what constituted a modern action-thriller, innovating with its gripping storylines, sharp camerawork and relatable yet remarkable protagonist. Even Brosnan admitted that the series would have had to raise its game in the face of what The Bourne Identity did; watching that and Die Another Day now, it's hard to believe that they came from the same decade, let alone the same year.\n\nCasino Royale manages to match The Bourne Supremacy for quality, borrowing some of its aesthetic touches (particularly in the chase sequences) while also capturing the intrigue of Ian Fleming's original novel. Like Paul Greengrass, Martin Campbell understands the need to knit action and character scenes together to create a holistic, gripping package; the action feels like an integral and natural part of the drama, rather than interrupting it in order to show off the budget. Campbell brings the same calm, steady and methodical touch that he brought to Goldeneye; having saved Bond from irrelevance once, he does it again in some style.\n\nSkyfall so often gets praised for acknowledging Bond's past while still being modern and relevant, but Casino Royale manages to pull off this same trick, and arguably does it slightly better. Where Skyfall consciously tips its hat to the older films through costumes, characters or props (such as the iconic Aston Martin DB5), Casino Royale is more subtle; all the classic elements are there, but they've been modernised and refined so that they make more sense in the real world. It's still fitting for Bond to drive an Aston Martin, and it's a nice touch to see its distant predecessor roll by. But it wouldn't make sense for Bond's car to have many gadgets that he doesn't need, and having the car be wrecked to save Vesper makes complete sense. Where Roger Moore or Brosnan's films glorified the gadgets, this restores some welcome credibility and keeps the hardware under wraps unless absolutely necessary.\n\nAlong these same lines, the screenplay takes all the best elements of Fleming's novel and transposes them into a contemporary setting. It still has all the glamour of the classic casino scenes from the Sean Connery era, but the playful banter and flirting has been replaced with high stakes, tense glances and much more serious consequences. Le Chiffre's relationships with arms dealers and dodgy speculation on the stock market felt current for its day and still feels very fresh; great effort is expended to ground the character's motivations while maintaining an air of intrigue, mystery and threat. The film takes itself seriously, but not too seriously; it wants to have fun, but it puts credibility above out-and-out entertainment, unlike many of Moore's entries in the canon.\n\nLe Chiffre's characterisation is also an interesting departure from what the Bond villain archetype has become. Where the likes of Drax, Stromberg and Blofeld wanted to single-handedly destroy or take over the world, Le Chiffre is essentially a middle-man; he is to the Craig era what Kristatos was in For Your Eyes Only, but better written and with a more interesting, more murky motivation. Like Bond, he is ultimately a pawn of bigger forces who struggles at times not to buckle under the pressure (as the torture scene demonstrates); by making him so small, he becomes more believable and more intimidating, even without the bleeding eye. He may look like the lead singer of Franz Ferdinand in his haircut and dress sense, but Mads Mikkelson plays him brilliantly, bringing a cold, dead-eyed feel to the character which both intrigues and repulses an audience.\n\nCreating convincing poker scenes in films is pretty difficult. The vast majority of efforts go for a highly stylised or choreographed approach, where audience expectations are pandered to through needless editing trickery; think of the final hand in The Cincinnati Kid, or the royal flush sequence in Maverick. Casino Royale's poker scenes may be more stylised than those in, say, The Sting or Rounders, but they are still very well-executed with good pacing and a frisson of unpredictability. What really makes them work, however, is the build-up in the script; there are little poker motifs dotted throughout, with comments about tells and misdirection. Because the film makes such a big theme out of bluffing and people not being what they seem, the card games don't feel like isolated set-pieces, and the later developments with Mathis and Vesper feel credible and yet still surprising.\n \nThe relationship between Craig's Bond and Vesper is very much a modern-day version of the relationship between George Lazenby's Bond and Tracey in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It isn't just that both characters ultimately don't make it past the final reel; the characters are both instrumental in the making of Bond, an affront and a challenge to his impulsive, playboy instincts and a safe refuge from the madness of his job and the people he has to kill. Eva Green is every bit as gripping and electric on screen as Diana Rigg before her; Vesper goes toe-to-toe with Bond and we get genuine character development, making her betrayal and death all the more shocking and heartbreaking. Craig's Bond is a changed man by the end of the film - it's just a pity that the resolution to his heartbreak in Quantum of Solace was as underwhelming and mishandled as the similar attempt in Diamonds Are Forever.\n\nThe heartbreak surrounding Vesper brings us onto another of Casino Royale's great successes: it hurts. Desmond Llewellyn's Q may have advised Bond that he should never let his enemies see him bleed, but the best Bond films have never been afraid of putting him through the mill, getting him into dangerous situations which can only be resolved at great cost - a cost often numbed by women and alcohol. The fight scenes in Casino Royale feel brutal, just as they should do; it isn't interesting to have someone waltz through conflict as though it was nothing. The torture scene and the defibrillator scene are great in isolation, but they are matched by Bond's emotional torment of losing Vesper. For the first time since Timothy Dalton's era - or Goldeneye at a push - Bond's pain feels real and meaningful.\n\nAll of which brings us to Daniel Craig as Bond. While his subsequent films have been hit-and-miss, his performance here is more than enough to silence those who criticised his casting (all those 'James Blonde' jokes sound all the more desperate now). He takes the suffering and burnt-out approach that Dalton brought and fuses it with some of Connery's unabashed cool to create a truly modern and contemporary Bond. He also has the confidence to eschew convention as much as he chooses to reflect or inhabit it; we get a build-up to a cliched sex scene, but then he's quickly on his toes and back to the plot.\n\nCasino Royale is a great, gripping spy thriller and arguably the finest of all the James Bond films. While it is slightly too long and a little too candid with some of its product placement, it remains an extraordinary reinvention of a franchise which had long been in need of a boost. Craig impresses in his first and finest performance as Bond, and Martin Campbell directs with great common sense and precision to create a majestic and immensely enjoyable film. Whether looking at the newer films or the franchise as a whole, this has set a very high bar which has yet to be beaten.",

            "content": "When Casino Royale was released back in 2006, people hated the idea of Daniel Craig portraying the iconic James Bond character. People were nervous that he would destroy the franchise with blond hair and blue eyes, but everyone's hatred of the idea came to a sudden end once the film was released, and it turned out to be the one of the best Bond films ever. In Casino Royale, a terrorist organization is relying on a man with the name Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) to win at a high-skates poker game to retrieve the money. James Bond (Daniel Craig) is assigned to play in the game as well to prevent Le Chiffre from getting the money. Casino Royale is my favorite James Bond film. It did everything right, it had no problems at all, it was perfect. This movie did what a 007 film is supposed to do, it showed the dark side of the character, along with a reasonable amount of suspense. Most of the movie revolves around the actual poker game. The film also brings in one of the best Bond girls in the franchise, named Vesper Lynd (Eva green) who helps 007 with his assignment. This film highly resembles the Mission Impossible films, it features the same style of film. It is a very well written movie that doesn't fail to show the version of the character straight from his origins. It also revived the franchise after previous, 'less than stellar entries'.\nOver all, if you are a fan of the James Bond movies, I would highly recommend it to you. It was perfect. 5/5 stars",

He feels self-deprecating in a way that no other James Bond has. Rather than relishing in being a suave super spy, he seems to despise the job and himself for being the one who has to do it. This is a brutal and calculated Bond that also happens to be a charming detective, rather than the latter being his sole attribute.",

Seriously, the STORY is so twisted and layered, yet unlike the convoluted political nonsense of a 'Mission: Impossible' film, it's personal and so it has high-stakes and flows really damn well. This is impressive on it's own as it keeps you captivated and engaged, but it's even more amazing when you consider how it sets up the next film and keeps you in the know and surprises you just the right amounts. Yes, if it sounds like it's achieved a lot, it has - for goodness sake not only is this an exciting revenge plot, a great spy-thriller and a gripping character tale - it's also the best love story of the franchise so far!\nBut a sophisticated story isn't all that makes this movie; something was needed to lift things above that grittiness. Luckily, this film found that solace in Daniel Craig. My gosh is this guy a good Bond; bringing a steeliness to compliment the new-found tone, yet a charm and witt to make everything all the more enjoyable. You properly, properly root for the guy, and that's thanks to Craig's performance, as well as his relevance and arc in the overall story. He can do smooth, he can do cold and he can damn well do action and as a result he's already the best Bond since Connery. Put all that good stuff in a film with all the usual fun action, glorious locations and sweeping musical numbers? It's kind of a Bond movie, but it's something quite a bit more too.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: A film this fresh and ambitious is bound to have problems, but the question is do they hinder the overall experience? Well, rarely; the only issue I have is that the overall tone is a little hard to adjust to - being such a fan of the classics. Having said that, in the words of 007 himself: \"do I look like I give a damn?\" Hmm I probably shouldn't, but I can say the feeling would have been less jarring had it stayed consistently dark throughout.\nVERDICT: I'd go as far as saying that the story in 'Casino Royale' is one of the biggest achievements in Cinema history. It engages, it flows and it works, and Daniel Craig elevates it even further. Just wow.",

Any questions about Daniel Craig's worthiness are thrown out almost immediately as we are handed a film filled to the brim with exquisite action and explosive emotion. I squirmed in my seat with delight as I have not done since I was a child. What \"Batman Begins\" did for that franchise, \"Casino Royale\" does, and more, for Bond. For a while it seemed that he might not be able to well exist outside the confines of the cold war, but here we are given an entirely modern Bond with enough nods to the original that we can't be too upset. Maybe it's because this is the last novel yet to be filmed in the traditional Bond manner and it is Ian Fleming who has stolen our hearts not this incarnation of the super spy. However I like to think that someone actually just got their act together and concentrated on the film itself as opposed to who they could get the most product placement money out of. Congratulations. James Bond will live on for at least one more generation, and maybe forever. Great set pieces and one of the best chase sequences not involving cars ever put on screen, blended with beautiful locations and even more lovely women add up to the perfect cocktail with the twisting story line acting as the lemon peel in the martini, holding it all together. Many will come out saying that this is the best Bond film ever and I can not rightly say they are wrong at this point. Only time will tell that tale. However every fan can be assured that this ranks amongst the very upper crust of Bond movies, and Craig is no Lazenby. He lends a harsh wit and a thuggish charm to the character and by the end he's no longer the new guy, he is Bond, James Bond.

It is so thoroughly complete as a film that I couldn't find reasons why it is not a 10/10, because I very much enjoy the 2 hours of watching and such genre of filmmaking is my cup of tea. (Plot holes shall be blamed on Ian Fleming's original novel)\n\nIn particular, I live how the scenes are cliche-free and cool, accentuating the badassery of Daniel Craig's Bond. The dialogues are very good. They appeared to be well-thought and was sometimes humorous. From \"Shaken or stirred? Do I look like a give a damn.\" to \"or I'll kill her. Allow me to.\" Old school humor in the lines also describes the character's situation and attitude in discreet ways are a shining aspect of the Bond film. Besides, how can one also not appreciate the acting chops by Daniel Craig, especially during the torture scene, and Eva Green's effort in portraying Bond's 101th bond girl, which has to be one of the more memorable ones amongst all of them. As for the small, detail aspects, the new Bond is given a personality and incredible build-up with scenes like the bomber murdering scene that showed his ego and Vesper's death scene that exemplified Bond's emotional vulnerability. His character was fully developed at the end and that in such graceful spontaneity.\n\nMy favourite moment, which I am often overly elated to tell, is in the app. half an hour poker showdown bet. Le chliffe and James Bond. Before the game Bond told the waitress a bunch of description for his drink, being cool and unorthodox. He soon screwed the thing after an all-in lost in which Le chliffe won all his money, as he was asked choices for his drinks, and it looks like he ain't got no damn to give this time. Spot on.",

Casino Royale is a bloated, over-long affair with a severe lack of realism and a woefully under-utilised Mads Mikklesen.  He could have easily been one of the best parts of the film, but he was criminally under-used.  Casino Royale wasn't a complete failure.  I did like some of its stylistic elements, such as the flashback scenes that were shot in black and white, but for the most part I found it boring and unengaging.\n\nRead my full review here:http://goo.gl/SQJaT4",

This reboot of the beloved character is a darker spin on the franchise and is definitely deserving of that PG-13 rating. One scene in particular will really make you cringe in pain, especially if you are a man. The movie has great performances by Daniel Craig and proves all the naysayers wrong, because if you look back to a year before this movie came out, people were really skeptical.\nIn the end, Casino Royale is a movie that is easily regarded as a classic.

A new 00 agent for MI6, Bond is assigned with incapacitating a terrorist (Mads Mikkelsen) behind an attempted bombing of a plane.\n\nThis is a fun and stylish Bond film. Daniel Craig is a very focused Bond, not so easily distracted by the lure of women. He is also an inexperienced Bond, lacking proper judgement in certain situations. It makes for a very relatable protagonist. Eva Green is also very strong as a British treasurer tasked with aiding Bond in the poker match. Mads makes for an ok villain as well.\n\nThe action in this movie is top-notch. After the opening credits (featuring a solid Bond song), a chase scene draws attention immediately. The stunt team in Casino Royale deserves a lot of props for some of the actions they had to pull off. Also, the music is very solid throughout; the classic Bond theme isn't heard until the very end, signifying Bond's character arc into the mysterious 007 agent we're more familiar with.\n\nThere are some little things I didn't care for in CR though. During another chase scene, there is a knife struggle in the middle of a crowded room, and, somehow, nobody notices. The movie feels long at 2 hours and 20 minutes, and that's thanks to the last 25 minutes or so. There's a twist towards the end that does nothing but serve as Bond's final transformation, and I feel like it could have been done in a way that didn't feel separate from the rest of the movie.\n\nOverall, Casino Royale will please new and old Bond fans alike while serving as a solid action movie. Go ahead and give it a watch if you have the 2+ hours!\n\nFinal grade: B+\n\n-Ben",

Mads Mikkelsen is did a really good job as a villain, and Eva Green is great as a Bond girl while still having her own character that makes it stick out. The writing by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis is well written, and the action sequences are great and fun to watch. The movie doesn't necessarily focus on the action scenes and is mostly on the plot, which is really well done also. The characters are memorable and so is the villain, the poker scenes are intense to watch, even though I know nothing about poker. The movie takes some new risks that made this film stand out, and when I thought that the movie should've ended at the main plot and had no reason to keep going, well it actually had a reason which I'm glad that I found it unpredictable. It's smart, and the film sets it up for the sequel very cleverly, even if Quantum of Solace turn out to be a hateful film for the fans.",

This novel got significant amount of praise and manage to start one of the most successful franchise in the history of cinema and the world most famous spy. But after 4 decades, Eon Productions finally got the rights to adapt this novel and use it as the story that would launch a new era for Bond: The Daniel Craig era. \nBefore becoming the iconic British spy, Bond had to earn his 00 status, and prove himself capable to take down any threat of the United Kingdom. \nIf you have read some of my reviews (particularly my reviews of the whole Mission Impossible franchise), you know that I am a Bond fan, as I love those campy old films in my childhood. But after the ridiculous Pierce Brosnan era (culminating in \"Die Another Day\") and being the subject of multiple parodies (particularly \"Austin Powers\") the franchise needed a reboot, and what better time than the early 2000s when every franchise was rebooted in a new way to make it memorable and realistic, and \"Casino Royale\" is one of the perfect examples of how to reboot a franchise. \"Casino Royale\" counts with an intense story that serves as one of the most personal Bond stories ever put on film, Craig\u00b4s Bond is a fresh air into the franchise as he is confident in the role, it has undeniably the greatest Bond girl of the entire franchise, Mad Mikkelsen makes justice to one of Bond\u00b4s most iconic enemies, Martin Campell\u00b4s directing is confident and focused on the storytelling, the action scenes are spectacular, the cinematography is beautiful, the trademark opening credits and Bond song are among the best of the franchise, the chemistry between Craig and Green is incredible, the amount of detail is impressive, the romantic aspect of the film is genially believable and makes you wish that they don't follow the Bond girl clich\u00e9, the action sequences are wonderfully shot, and the screenplay plays with the expectations of us Bond fans or knowers of the franchise. While it is a little frustrating for a fan that it purposely lacks some Bond troupes (the henchmen, the supporting MI6 characters, some of Bond\u00b4s trademark lines, the standard gun barrel sequence, etc.), but at the same time it is more than justify and the finished result is nothing less than thrilling and unforgettable. \n\"Casino Royale\" is quite possibly the greatest reboot in the history of cinema (I even dare to say that it is a better reboot than \"Batman Begins\", another of my childhood heroes) and is arguably the greatest film of the franchise (it is tied with \"Goldfinger\" in my top Bond film). It is intense, personal, shocking, beautiful, classy and unforgettable. This proves that James Bond is the greatest spy represented in cinema.",

In the end, nothing is truly solved, there is still a higher power roaming free. Nevertheless, this adventure tested Bond more than ever before. He learned many lessons he probably hoped he would never learn. We get to see Bond in really emotional times of his life dealing with love, his career choice, and what it means to have a \"license to kill.\" \nThe script is extremely well written with some fantastic one-liners coming from Bond's lips. We can also feel the tensions as strongly as he does. What adds to this is the way the film is shot and directed. There is an intensity underlying every scene, even if the scene doesn't call for it. These shots also make Bond's kills more personal in their feel. This is not the same Bond as the one who formed its foundation, however, this is a Bond for the modern-times with all the same sleekness and suave looks he needs to carry that name.",

            "content": "It's well documented how much I don't like the Brosnan films but we got a new Bond because of the lack of quality in those films.  That new Bond being Daniel Craig.  Since this film, Casino Royale, was the first Bond film I ever saw, it has a special place in my love of Bond, and films in general.  But it's not just that it was my first Bond, Casino Royale is a great film no matter what.\n\nAs a new Bond usually does, Casino Royale reinvented the formulaic nature of this series.  This all starts by giving Bond one of if not the best female leads of all time.  Eva Green may be the first ever Bond woman of the series as she exemplifies pure strength in her vulnerability.  She is not a damsel in distress and she is in no way the usual eye candy or sex object that the series can sometimes rely upon.  Her chemistry with Craig is undeniable as is her likability as the stunning and seductive Vesper Lynd.\n\nIt's the longest Bond film upon its release which is noticable, but it's also used to the film's advantage.  There are plenty of twists and turns to go along with some of the series' best action sequences to date.  Right from the opening pre-credits to the thrilling climatic sscene, Casino Royale blends the best of what modern day CGI and effects have to offer while also showing tribute to the best of what the series offered so far.  Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre, a quietly manipulating investor for terrorists.  The first half of the film is non-stop action packed as 007 goes after Chiffre, but it really picks up once Green and Mikkelsen come into play.\n\nCasino Royale is in many ways an origin story for Bond.  We begin the film with him just being promoted to '007' status.  He's careless and very much egotistical throughout the film.  But he shows the beginnings to the Bond we love.  We don't even here the classic Bond theme until the very end of the film, but everything really comes together perfectly for this movie.  I think it may be my favorite of the series because it doesn't rely on the beautiful girls and action sequences to tell a great story.  Both of those aspects are very present, but they don't overpower just how great the story and writing are.  But I think the thing I appreciate the most about the film is that it treats the audience intelligently unlike the few films before it.\n\n+Origin story\n\n+Eva Green is fantastic\n\n+High powered action\n\n+Mixed with a twisted and intelligent plot\n\n+Mikkelsen\n\n+Not formulaic\n\n9.6/10",

Stripped of corny CGIs, the stunt actions were amazingly heart stopping. Unlike his predecessors, Daniel Craig is one Bond with more substance, agility,stamina, brains and pain tolerance. His chemistry with Judi Dench (M) was magic. It was clearly obvious, she commanded respect from 007. Very few do. Otherwise his arrogance and punch lines injected superb humour. Brilliant action film with probably the best James Bond ever. Strong, intelligent, gutsy and strikes fear in people with his piercing blue eyes.. Never a dull moment in this nearly 2.5 hours long film Very gritty and painful to watch at times. One thinks James Bond has a very high thresh hold for pain. Nice to see James Bond has his spell of domesticity and inebriation with love. Although it did end tragically and explained his flippant desire of one night stands with future female encounters (save for Her Majesty Service where he met his next tragic love story).

There is no better spy film than the current James Bond franchise. Amen. My only quibble with this film is casting Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. I dunno, she seems fairly average and not very interesting. Hard to understand what Bond sees in her.

This movie brought to the Bond franchise what it had been missing for years: a human Bond. Not a campy super-spy, killing machine; a grounded, fresh take on the iconic character.\n\nThis film also gave us an iconic, very solid villain. The best villains are those who we as the audience can understand. We were able to believe that Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre would go to any extreme necessary because his life was on the line. He wasn't doing these things simply to toy with people, or because he's just inherently evil. If he didn't get the money, he would be assassinated. This gave Bond a solid rival, one who would go to great length to oppose him. Not because he wanted to, but because he had to.\n\nEva Green was a spectacular choice for the role of Vesper Lynd. She manages to not only capture Bond's heart, but the audience's as well. And [no spoilers, although the film is almost 10 years old] the twist at the end of the film works really well, and is surprisingly believable.\n\nThe movie is just overall a really intense thrill ride, but it doesn't simply rely of heart-pounding action in order to maintain its intensity. It often finds it in the most intriguing of places. The poker scenes are some of the most tense in the film. Casino Royale was a brilliant, realistic take on the Bond character and left audiences (myself included) salivating for future installments.",

Daniel Craig is an epitome of that, taking James Bonds character forward with a more raw personality that is honest, arrogant and genuine. The story itself is suspenseful with its own twists and turns and has all that you expect from a traditional bond movie yet feeling completely fresh with less tacky gadgetry and more intelligence. The woman in bonds arm is this time a story of love and lost, a source for all anger and direction for the movies to come in the franchise. Overall its a fantastic watch, one you have to be in the mood to watch compared to the 007 of old which is more of a popcorn flick, a bold move in the right direction.",

            "content": "A soft reboot of the franchise, Casino Royale opens with Bond notching his first two kills to earn double-zero status. His body count rapidly accelerates to an impressive number, considering most of the film revolves around a game of cards. Casino also earned an impressive number at the box office as the highest-grossing Bond film to that point.\n\nThe Daniel Craig movies bring Bond into the 21st century with a bang, leaning far more heavily on traditional gritty action and drama than on the hokey gadgets and superweapons that the franchise was known for. Instead of the Cold War crazies, the film\u00e2(TM)s baddie is motivated purely by money.\n\nMads Mikkelsen is tremendous as Le Chiffre, a banker for many of the world\u00e2(TM)s terrorist organizations. After gambling away his clients\u00e2(TM) funds on a failed stock market manipulation plot, he arranges a high-stakes poker game to try and cover his tracks.\n\nRoyale is guilty of some of the insanely overly choreographed nonsense that befalls many modern movies. As if someone legitimately trying to get away would scale a crane and try to navigate their way through the steel beam skeleton of a skyscraper under construction, rather than simply disappearing into the street crowds. It\u00e2(TM)s hard to fault it, however, as that\u00e2(TM)s exactly the kind of over the top action that the Bond movies are famous for, and its fans have come to expect the fantastic.\n\nThe score is perfect throughout. It builds consistently throughout the airport scene. It\u00e2(TM)s wondrous, hopeful, and adventurous in the all the right moments. David Arnold deserved an Oscar nod for his work. The late Chris Cornell provided a quality title track.\n\nEva Green shares remarkable chemistry with Craig and gives a splendid performance as Vesper Lynd, the Treasury agent supervising Bond\u00e2(TM)s purse strings at the casino and one of the best-written Bond girls to date.\n\nCraig is perfect as Bond, even if the script prevents him from being remarkable. The strong silent type is a hard character to earn any accolades for portraying, but the newest Bond does all he can be expected to do. He\u00e2(TM)s confident, suave, and ruggedly handsome. Easily the most badass of all the Bonds, his writers are unfortunately lacking in the humorous one-liner department.\n\nThe writing team of Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade lays the groundwork for an excellent saga to come and Campbell would make a welcome director in future installments. Overall, Casino is everything a spy movie aught to be.",

I was underwhelmed with both Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, but now I understand the hype for Daniel Craig. This serves as an insightful and thrilling origin to James Bond. \n\nFrom the first scene this film is on point with keeping the pace and action enticing. Moving through the locations and different feeling you get with each set piece keep everything fresh. You have classic chases, gun fights, and torture scenes in spy movies, but the downtime in between is also engaging, particularly the poker game. It's hard to think of a movie in 2006 being dated but the height of Texas Hold Em' clearly influenced this film. However that just increases the buy in to the suspense. You do not see what is coming, ever. I loved how this movie is clearly a learning curve for James Bond to become a world class spy, teaching that he can't just skirt by with his charm and get all the perks without making sacrifices.\n\nSpeaking of which the relationship between Daniel Craig's Bond and Eva Green's Vesper is electric. The chemistry is apparent from the first interaction, and they only increase the magnetism as the situation gets more complicated. The climax of the film leaves the relationship undefined, and her death scene underwater is heart breaking. You feel the anger and desperation in Craig's face, and by the end his demeanor clearly shows someone who has felt substantial loss. The stoic, bad ass character of James Bond is born with his iconic line to end on the highest note. \n\nSome other positives are the very Bond-like villain in Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre, Judi Dench as M, the subtle Bond gadgets/car, and gorgeous look overall. Some nit picks is that since the movie is longer some of the beginning scenes felt less connected, even when they were a pleasure to experience.",

Previous films portrayed Bond as sex first then mission second.  The absolutely stunning Eva Green just takes my breath away.  The filming is superb, story is great, and the pace is kept up.  Showing that Bond is sentimental and caring gives depth to the character and we can root for him because he is a decent guy, not just because.

Other than the fact that I bought my copy for 2 bucks, oh, absolutely! Granted, I haven't seen many of the James bond films, but \"Casino Royale\" does what it sets out to do. Whether it's to establish Craig's Bond for later installments or feed off the success of the previous entries--no matter how you look at it,\"Casino Royale\" works. It's full of great action, suspense, and sly humor; Craig might not look like fits the role of James Bond on the surface. But let me tell you, when the iconic theme starts playing near the end, and Craig says that one famous line. That's it, he's proved himself, and all doubt is erased. It's interesting because after I watched \"Skyfall\"--back when the hype around it was at its height and having never had seen Craig act as 007--I had a bit of trouble identifying with him as the character. And, had I seen \"Casino Royale\" when it was out in theaters, my opinion of the Craig-era Bond movies might have been different. I know, for a fact, that I didn't like \"Quantum of Solace\" that much despite its wickedly awesome title [and 'Quantum' is a short movie compared to 'Casino' and 'Sky.']. So now I kind of want to revisit \"Skyfall\" before the upcoming \"Spectre\" is on the big screen.",

Less obvious but equally impactful is the reforging of Bond for the female gaze, while retaining the Bond Girl aesthetic, with modern updates to give the women more agency. There are two fantastic villains in both Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre and Jesper Christensen as Mr. White, an incredible supporting cast, an incredible sense of wit, relentless and breathtaking action, and a sharp, tense plot.

And from the beginning this takes itself very seriously, although maybe a bit too seriously, but I guess the main aim was to remove itself from the last couple of Brosnan movies as much as possible and start over again. There's certainly romantic plot elements lifted from \"The spy who loved me\" and \"On her majesty's secret service\", which is a fine asset to have. And Eva Green is a perfect inclusion to the Bond universe, while the action is hard hitting and has real weight behind it as Bond gets badly hurt more in this than any other entry. If this just had a touch of humour, which is an important element to any Bond flick, then this would be one of my favourites, but it's still very good.",

Casino Royale can only be described as a high-stakes gambling thriller where Bond is forced to play a ludicrously big poker game in order to defeat a master weapons dealer. \n\nCasino Royale was Daniel Craig's first go at being 007 and the movie goes with that theme, this essentially being an origin story as to how Bond becomes a 00 agent. It starts off with a beautifully constructed black and white scene which goes to show the style that this new Bond undertakes during his missions. But right after the gorgeous opening theme, the film cuts to an action scene with Bond tearing Africa apart and shows his naivety as a special agent and how much he still has to learn to become the agent that he is in that opening shot. And on cue, Bond gets called out by M about it. This beginning to a \"new\" Bond really sets the tone for the movie as Bond now has to deal with overcoming his childishness and put away his ego if he wants to prove himself as a 00 agent. \n\nIntertwined with this theme of becoming a mature 00, Bond has to now delve deeper into the mission that involves essentially defeating the supposed villain Le Chiffre in a very high stakes Poker game. There's never any time for Bond to be just sitting idly, and in the midst of the entire poker game (which has to have lasted about 45 minutes) a bunch o' danger things happen to Bond, which when they happen, you're just saying to yourself: \"Yea, that's something that would only happen to Bond.\"\n\nI think it has to be said right away that I absolutely loved this film, not just because as we progress through his series, I feel Daniel Craig is the best Bond in terms of being able to emotionally relate to him when he goes through his trials and tribulations. Minus Quantum of Solace of course. But this movie also gives us its utmost best attempt at portraying Bond and the rest of MI6 to be more like what would be found in the modern day. \n\nHowever, this film is not perfect, not by a long shot. First off, it is way too long, clocking in at 144 minutes. The last 20-25 minutes could easily have been lopped off as it becomes more akin to a romance gone bad than a typical Bond movie. Second, the way it deals with the villain is atrocious. One of the things that made a Bond film a classic was the villain. You look at past movies like the early Sean Connery films and you remember that you had great villains in Dr. No and Blofeld. Le Chiffre belongs to that club as being a very memorable villain, playing this weapons dealer who's got his own issues to a tee. What ruins it, is how the plot develops to get rid of him. Of course, he's gonna be killed, this is a Bond film, the villain would never survive and make Bond look bad. But the way Le Chiffre is killed is partly a connection to the last 20 minutes when the actual villain of the story is revealed. But that is still the 20 minutes that I would have chopped off in the cutting room. But the movie's purpose in the portrayal is that there is always a higher up who is in more control of the supposed main characters.\n\nThe other memorable part of Bond films tends to be the Bond Girl. In years past, Bond girls have been iconic characters like Pussy Galore covered in gold in Goldfinger, or just like her, the girls have had manic names. But in previous movies, they've been there, for the most part, for the pleasure of Bond. In this, Eva Green nails the performance by bringing out the emotional side of Bond. Their interaction is key and the building of their relationship is crucial as to how the plot progresses to defeat Le Chiffre. They start with this witty banter which moves to a more loving relationship after an \"unfortunate stairs scene\" involving Bond, Vesper and a couple of mad African killers. However, even after the twist that director Martin Campbell throws the viewers way, Bond is now in an emotional state that shows that the \"game\" is not all about him anymore and that there are people around who immensely care about him anymore. And this is the biggest redeeming factor of the movie as you get a complete rounding of Bond from being egotistical to by the end being the Bond that we're all used to seeing. And that is none too apparent than Bond not using his trademark line of \"The name's Bond, James Bond\" till the absolute end of the movie.\n\nCasino Royale does a great job of \"rebooting\" a franchise which had gotten over-reliant on using gimmicks and odd story-lines for their movies, in a way that made James Bond look like he was invincible. Casino Royale doesn't do that. You can actually feel every blow that Bond takes in the movie, and makes him almost like a normal, mortal human being and what it would be if they took that much punishment. There are reservations that I had about the film, a lot of them regarding the final 20 minutes, but I am willing to overlook that just cause the rest of the movie was shot marvelously. \n\nCasino Royale earns its 00 status and gets a B+\n\nhttp://thefilmlawyers.wordpress.com for more reviews",

With an in depth crime thriller and really what can only be\nsaid is a special agents film to be used as a template for success,\nRoyale succeeds in bringing us the viewer a fantastic story and\nprobably the best Bond film of all time, maybe. I felt it was firmly\nvery good, and here below is why so.\n\nThe story is very interesting, it doesn't mind backing off the massive\nstunts and fights in parts, but then when they do come they are done so\nwell it just serves to make this even more suspenseful. It has a plot\nwe rarely see also and with a villain to match that, Casino Royale\nreally brings us a fresh plot and it is hard to find much wrong with\nmost of the film. One last thing on the story is that is breathes\nsuspense as said, knowing what will happen next is hard and any moment\ncan throw Bond or others into unpredictable moments.\n\nDaniel Craig in his first outing as Bond is great, he maybe doesn't\nquite have the feel of Bond all the way through but that is what is so\ngood, he took a risk in making a Bond different and it definitely pays\noff in a great way. Eva Green as the Bond girls is good too, she also\nbrings a new type of Bond girl and they have a great chemistry that is\nreally good to see from a franchise accused of sexism in it's past. I\npersonally would have liked to have seen more of M in this Bond, it\ndoesn't harm it but I think any Bond fan likes the some of the lines\nshe can deliver.\n\nThe script is pretty tight, it doesn't seem to stray at any time and is\nprobably the strongest script Bond has ever produced, brings a\nsurprisingly dramatic depth to the movie. Director Martin\nCampbell(director of Bond's Goldeneye) is good in this role here and\nbrings consistency along with him from his previous Bond outing, again\nwe find new life in Bond with him too. As I alluded too the stunts are\namazing, the best we have seen ever and to be fair this movie, they\naren't long sequences, they don't try hard to fit them in but my gosh\ndo they work, spot on.\n\nI guess the only critical point would have to be the air that, well\nthis isn't stereotypically a Bond movie, it does lack the music we so\noften get from Bond and anyone wanting a nostalgic look back on Bond is\nnever going to get this from this movie. I guess it could also be said\nthat Bond doesn't fit the Bond type(Craig has bulging arms and light\nhair), but I think the roughness reminds me of Connery and his not so\nsave attitude at times but then when the women came, he was ready, as\nis Craig.\n\nBond film fans should absolutely love this, if you watched Die Another\nDay before this too then even more so, it is a massive step up in Bond\nhistory, and one we kind of haven't seen since Goldfinger. It has a lot\nof good action and as said twice now stunts, those who enjoy that will\nalso like this film as it can just as quietly dramatic as it can be\nloud but also with a tinge of drama running through it's historic\nveins.\n\nOverall I give this a low 8/10, it is Firmly a Very Good movie, I always think\nand want Bond to get better with every new movie but I tell you, if any\ntop Casino Royale they well have to be Great because this is one Bond\nthat knows how to get it done. Just watch it with ease and of course\nwatch Daniel Craig in his first go at this, he shouldn't disappoint\nanybody and of course in any person is a fan of a good looking\nphysique, well Daniel Craig coming out the sea may just excite you.",

The torture scene was one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. It was helped by the very smart and a great dialogue that makes you go \"damn he really does have balls\". He was almost fantastic and he wasn't the only with a great performance. Eva Green was also marvelous in the movie and very smart with the performance. The direction and screenplay were top notice. It wasn't held down with idiotic over the top action sequences or a confusing plot that turns out to be just a mess. It stayed true to the bond series while giving something of its own. The cartoony Die another day and others from the series is lost and this was perfect for the movie. It wasn't also held back with a kind of crappy and weak villain. The villain wasn't just one person also and that brought an unique spin. There was always someone coming after bond and no real head villain trying to destroy bond. The movie also kept throwing thing at him and never led up for a moment. It was a little much but rewarding. We also see bond as this undeveloped agent that makes a few mistakes along the way, giving us a unique aspect of bond. It was again rewarding a make the imperfect moments feel real.   Overall a solid movie bolstered by a great Bond performance. 9.1/10",

Best of all the story is told superbly, rich with characters and subplots that connect beautifully leaving nothing unanswered. \r\n\r\nM sends 007 on a mission that takes him to lush locales such as Madagascar and the Bahamas where events lead him to Montenegro to go up against financier Le Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale, where Le Chiffre plans to win so be can pay back his deadly terrorist clients. Never before has an assignment felt so realistic in a Bond adventure, it's probably the smartest and well written since Goldeneye back in 1995. There is action that goes beyond anything you've ever seen, Bond climbs a construction site chasing after supremely talented freerunner Sebastien Foucan ending in one heck of a shootout, then there's the extremely tense airport chase where Bond attempts to foil a bombing, and the opening featuring Bond's first kills that promote him to \"00\" status is fierce and one of the best prologue's in Bond history, followed by Chris Cornell's excellent \"You Know My Name. \r\n\r\nHowever, whilst the action is constructed perfectly the poker games are what thrilled me the most, Martin Campbell directs with style ensuring you're feeling like a player or someone watching in the background, I love the focus on the player's tells and the facial expressions pulled by Bond and Le Chiffre. No review would be complete without mentioning how brilliant Daniel Craig is, or the supporting cast, Craig is witty, brutal and utterly convincing as 007. Eva Green is like the ultimate Bond girl, not playing a damsel in distress but a smart and sassy girl who puts Bond in his place. Judi Dench is one of the all time great actresses and M is one of her finest characters, I like her blunt nature towards Bond and no nonsense approach. Mads Mikkelsen is terrifying as Le Chiffre, he's probably the most realistic Bond enemy, seeing that he doesn't live in a volcanic hidden base or has a nuclear missile aimed at a satellite which is something we've seen in the past. \r\n\r\nWithout a doubt Bond needed sprucing up, for a big fan of the franchise that's hard to say but it's true, especially after Die Another Day, and Casino Royale is the perfect entry to restart this explosive franchise.",

The plot is very well thought out as it surprises us with every turn, making its mark on the thriller genre. The violence is all over the place, but used as a great plot motivator, and let's face it, no one will ever forget the torture scene. The torture scene and the multiple beatings Bond receives from his opponents play with the idea that James Bond isn't a ridiculously overpowered super-spy, but instead a human being who isn't always going to win. Overall, this modern reinvention of the classic spy hits home, and grandly enter Casino Royale into the list of greats.",

            "content": "After the near franchise suicide that was \"Die Another Day\", the powers that be behind the Bond series had a mammoth task ahead of them. It would have been easy to give up then and there, no one would have batted an eye lid, but after a much needed rest, James Bond was recast and rebooted. \"Casino Royale\" finds James Bond going back to his roots, stepping back to before the worlds biggest spy became a double o agent. Bond is reckless, fresh and for once in his entire career, in serious trouble, as he finds himself on the trail of a huge organisation, layered with many contributors. One such contributor, La Chiffre, a deadly business man who has invested his partners money in shares, recklessly playing the stock market and finding himself in a world of debt and desperation. La Chiffre attempts to settle his debt by winning a poker tournament at The Casino Royale, however James Bond and MI6 have other plans, leading to one of Bonds biggest challenges yet. Returning to Bonds debut book and placing the charge in Martin Campbell's, director of \"Goldeneye\", hands, the James Bond franchise fires back into life, with all the impact of an atomic bomb. Gone are the ludicrous gadgets, over the top quips and most importantly an immortal Bond. Daniel Craig totally destroys all previous efforts, dating back to Connery, as our hero James Bond, he is a reckless killing machine, charming and chiseled, with an abundance of class, Bond has never been played so well and it shows. In fact all of the cast deliver a sterling performance, Mads Mikkelson is one of the best Bond villains ever to grace our presence, Judi Dench is ferocious as M, Eva Green is a powerful and formidable assistant for Bond, even Giancarlo Gianni is magnificent as Bond's middle man, Matthis. The entire cast hit all the right notes, which is formidable enough, however Casino Royale's writing is a cut above a vast quantity of Bond outings. Characters are rich and complex, the film is vast and weighty and the new direction never feels stale or lost. That's not to say that everything James Bond has ever been is gone, he's hardly a shadow of his former self, however Campbell strips Bond back, makes it dangerous and takes some risks. One such risk is Casino Royale's main set piece, unlike previous outings, most James Bond films would contain a plethora of action sequences, culminating in one outstanding spectacle, here however the writers and Campbell take a different approach, allowing the meat of the piece to be the card game itself, lasting almost 45 minutes of screen time, Campbell makes every hand just as tense and riveting as the action set pieces before and after it, its a welcomed change of tact, allowing fans to venture outside their comfort zone and experience something new, that's not to say Campbell's venture doesnt crank up the violence or stunt work, quite the opposite, the first hour of Casino Royale is littered with some of the best action Bond has ever undertook and what makes it more memorable is the fact that Craig forces his character to get hurt, to make mistakes, this arc makes every fight, every explosion feel threatening. Casino Royale continually feels fresh, throwing convention to the wind and looking outstanding doing so. There are a few hiccups, some dialogue is laughably atrocious, luckily these porkers are placed far away from each other, the ending feels like the entire engine is running out of fuel, it still rivets but never outshines the wonderful card game, and we are left with an ending that clearly baits for a sequel. None of these factors hinder the overall experience, \"Casino Royale\" is tense, well crafted and the best outing Bond has seen since \"Goldeneye\", Craig is perfect as Bond and his supporting cast deliver some of the most memorable performances from the entire franchises history. Although a huge departure from previous installments, some fans may miss franchise regular hijinks and the stupidity of some of the more flamboyant Bond moments and Casino Royales gas does start to run out in the final act, Campbell and Craig deliver something new and exciting, leaving us with a much needed revitalization that seemed impossible years prior.",

Great action and stunts, a bigger focus on characterization/dialog, diverse locations - the movie is solid, and even the slower sequences involving poker manage to keep you engaged with the tension and high stakes.

Director Martin Campbell (also the director of Goldeneye) brings another great Bond film and once again introduces us to a great, new Bond. Daniel Craig portrays what's the closest representation of Ian Fleming's Bond from the novels and in doing so, became associated with being one of the best Bonds. Easily one of the best Bond films out there and one that fits in very appropriately with our 21st century ideals.",

Otherwise, please try, just a little, to maintain some sense of realism.\nI also get so sick of everyone double-crossing everyone else. I expect it in a movie like this, but come ON. I just gave up and rolled my eyes 360 degrees at the last one. \nOk, that was my negative stuff. On the positive side, I thought the movie was well written, acted, directed, etc. \nI like that they took some efforts to make Bond, as a character, more human. There was some gritty stuff here, and it works. \nDaniel Craig made for a great Bond, and I look forward to seeing the next two.

Then he travels to Madagascar where he spies on terrorist Mollaka played by Sebastien Foucan and later tracks down the rest of the terrorists in the Bahamas. Leading him to the company of the mysterious Dimitrios played by Simon Abrakrian, and his girlfriend Solange played by Caterina Murino, bond soon realises that  he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre played by Mads Mikkelsen. That's pretty much what the plot is. the rest of the film is pretty much action and suspense. This was Daniel Craig's first film starring as the lead character and he owned it. He reminded me a bit of Sean Connery because of his voice and the way certain scenes were played out in the film. Before this, he starred in the brute gangster thriller Layer Cake which i found to be a cool movie and gave it a good score. When he was casted, movie critics and fans went vitally crazy making up quotes such as \"The Name's Bland. James Bland.\" and internet campaigns such as \"danielcraigisnotbond.com\" but when proved to them, they all got the opposite reaction and the movie was a success and it deserves to be a success. This interesting, psychological study of 007 promises everything that the fans have been waiting for including me; therefore it is ranking up with my other favourite James Bond movies dating back to the Sean Connery movies. Casino Royale (2006) aka Bond 21 gets a 9.8/10.",

The movie begins with a very exciting scene in Madagascar. The low level very talented acrobatic bad guy being chase by Bond through a construction site destroying everything and the crane scene was incredible and the actions got us comfortable for another great thriller. \n\n Alas with lowered expectations we were exposed to Bond women whom did nothing to remind us of the early Bond classics. The bad guy has a blind eye that bleeds and creeps you out and is distracting. This is a guy that is trying to extort money through a gambling game where all 15 contestants must put up 10 Million dollars with the winner moving that money into their own personal account. \n\n The premise is sound but the relationship between Bond and the Vesper Lynd character is like watching dieting tips on the VIEW.\n\n We get it that its the chess match love match, but it takes the early exciting scenes and turns this into a romantic flick disguised as an action show. Luckily Craig shows his very stiff acting ability in a scene in the airport that is very exciting as Bond foils the largest plane in the world from getting a rude sendoff. Fill in the blanks.\n\n The gadgets that I was waiting to see and the brief time that the fun character Q is missing. We are forced to listen to the whining M whom is one character that doesn't appear to add any value to the movie. This is a movie to fast forward through many scenes.\n\n I understand the need to upgrade the Ian Fleming classic but the new Bond doesn't have it in this movie. I'll give him another chance in the next movie but this should be one and done. \n\n The need to sleep through many parts of this movie only stirred me occasionally. The grand finale ended after the 1st half hour of the movie and like paint drying I got bored stiff. I haven't been this dissapointed since the other stiff Superman Returns. \n\n The Casino scenes were mildly intertwined with bad guys beating up Bond and vice versa. Don't waste your time go rent one of the originals they were corny but we didn't have to agonize between the new sensitive Bond at the end of the movie. \n\n The scenery was terrific but the acting and bad chemistry between Craig and the Bond women leave us looking for someone cool with the smarts to outwit the bad guys and gadgets that are clever and make us wanting to watch it over again. \n\n Keep your options open this is a poor effort with so much potential.",

Craig is bloody damned great as Bond, in a movie that creates a new reality for the character.  \r\n\r\nDirector Martin Campbell builds suspense in the extended poker game by not being afraid to focus for long    seconds on the eyes of the two main opponents, which is all the more effective because Le Chiffre's left eye has tears of blood, inspiring a classic Bond line. Bond's absences from the table are of more than ordinary interest.Also, every action scene is mindblowing.

It took me this long to finally give the reboot a go, and I was very impressed with how it turned out.\n\nBased on the very first book in the Bond series (why it was never made a big-screen film until now, I have no clue), James Bond (Daniel Craig) is given his status as 007 (license to kill and all), and uses his skills to go after a very corrupt and wealthy terrorist (Mads Mikkelsen) that he uncovers while bringing down a bomb-maker in Madagascar. By teaming up with treasurer Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), who finances Bond in this mission, Bond has to cleverly defeat this madman in a high stakes poker game at Casino Royale where the winnings can be used to bankrupt the terrorist from making any more threats.\n\nBefore I go on with this reboot, let me give a little history on the Bond franchise up to this point. By 2006, many audiences had given up with another James Bond film. Though the character had made a comeback with Goldeneye in 1995 (one I'm not familiar with), the followups with Pierce Bronsnan returned to the level of criticism in the Roger Moore films, with 2002's Die Another Day considered a very low point in the franchise. As plans were announced for a reboot, reports were very mixed on what was to come. Daniel Craig, the star, was typecasted as too short for the role, but director Martin Campbell's (of Goldeneye) involvement gave fans an optimistic hope. Not only did Casino Royale defy expectations, but it also gave the franchise a sign that it's ready to tackle new challenges in each decade.\n\nAnd Casino Royale works well in the fact that the producers opted for a grittier storyline that was more faithful to Ian Fleming's original intentions. This decision paid off big time, from the very stylish b&w opening sequence where Bond receives his 007 status, action to the point of exhilaration you get in the Bourne movies (the stuntwork in this is phenomenal, particularly the crane sequence in Madagascar), and even up to the point where Bond is actually depicted as not an invincible superhero like others depicted him as. In a scene that was very hard to sit through, the villains force Bond to severely wreck his high-priced Ashton Martin, to where they capture him, strip him, tie him to a chair, and literally torture him for information. The scene is very brutal and very deserving of it's PG-13 rating (the fact that Bond was in the nude in this scene almost gets it to an R in my book had it not been for the lighting), but I'm glad that it shows that Bond actually gets some heavy hits once in a while.\n\nMany critics have described Casino Royale as \"the perfect James Bond film\", but I don't think so. Though I appreciate the darker edge of the film, I wasn't satisfied enough. For one, the film's pacing is a little rough, particularly in the casino scenes. I know it plays a very integral role to building up the plot, but I was a little restless in the buildup, almost to the point where I dozed off. But thankfully, as the buildup intensifies, the film goes back to that dazzling feeling of a sharp and intense spy thriller.\n\nIn the experiences I've had with 007, I've always thought that Sean Connery is the ultimate Bond, due to his awesome sense of style and sharpness he puts on the table. Though Daniel Craig comes nowhere close to Connery's awesomeness (especially when compared to Goldfinger), Craig still manages to pack a punch in his own right. As mentioned earlier, Craig's cold, hard stares show us that Bond is more than just an invincible spy with all these cool gadgets to show off every 5 seconds. As Roger Ebert put it, \"Craig makes a superb Bond ... who gives the sense of a hard man, wounded by life and his job, who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong\". And I have to say it again, he clearly nails his emotions in scenes of true grit, such as the ending and that torture scene.\n\nAnother plus is how the film doesn't go into any dated sexism that plagued a lot of the older films. For once, there is not a 007 film with any nude women in the opening credits, and that's a big refresher. Sure Bond still has sex with women, but I felt it wasn't glorified like in past releases (the one Roger Moore film I saw literally depicted Bond as a sex addict). A big irony here is that 007 has the eyes on the sex table unlike the Bond girls over the years. In one scene, he walks away from the beach in a similar manner to Ursula Andress in Dr. No, and it's 007 that actually gets stripped of clothing instead of any women this time. This is another reason why I think Casino Royale is a strong effort of moviemaking when anything stands up against stereotyping and sexism.\n\nI also have to give Eva Green credit as she's one of the Bond girls that actually has some attitude and class compared to the countless of bland actresses that have teamed up with 007 over the years. Her chemistry with Craig is excellent to where it actually shows them in their intense relationship, and the emotions actually click this time around. I also loved that 007's boss M is actually female this time around, as it gives the two more memorable chemistry to come around. And Judi Dench nails at what she's given.\n\nSadly though the villain is still another generic baddie in the world of 007. Though Mads Mikkelston gives it his all in the performance, I was never given any clear reason to the villain's motives of blowing up stuff. But I at least give him credit for delivering in the character's sadism during the said torture scene.\n\nDavid Arnold scored the film (one of five that he did). Arnold's not one of my favorite composers (his score for the 1998 Godzilla is a horrendous ripoff of John Williams music), but I really liked what he does in this film. He maintains the jazz vive that brought the franchise to popularity in the first place, and creates a faithful adaptation of that classic Bond theme. As for the film's traditional theme song of the show, I liked Chris Cornell's \"You Know My Name\" as it showed the framework of a grittier Bond film, but it's nowhere as memorable as Bond songs of the past (nothing can top Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\").\n\nIt still has it's weak spots (particularly in pacing and in villainy), but Casino Royale is one of the best Bond films I've seen. Though my thoughts for best Bond still goes to Sean Connery, I applaud the studio for creating a grittier storyline and its hard, very intense, Jason Bourne-styled action. Plus Daniel Craig still packs a punch on his own as a great 007 and the emotional level is raised to a whole new level for the franchise. After finally watching Casino Royale, though I still wouldn't consider myself a fan of the franchise, at least it gives me a little hope in experiencing some of the other films, particularly the other films starring Daniel Craig.\n\n\"I have no armor left. You've stripped it from me. Whatever is left of me - whatever is left of me - whatever I am - I'm yours. \"",

She is smart, sophisticated and probably the most complex bond girl since Diana Rigg in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. \"You Know My Name - Chris Cornell\" is also one of the best bond songs. It has that perfect mix of classic bond flare with a new alternative sound grounded in the 21st Century.

            "content": "After the Pierce Brosnan era of James Bond, the series was rebooted in 2006 with Daniel Craig as the new James Bond and taking away the silliness of the previous James Bond films and making it more realistic. The film was titled after the first book in the Ian Fleming series which was titled Casino Royale. There was a public outcry from fans of the series about Daniel Craig being cast as James Bond with some people even saying that he was the worst James Bond ever even before the movie came out. He wasn't well known at the time, but is now famous because of his role. Casino Royale is a masterpiece of film and in my opinion the best movie of 2006 and the best James Bond movie to date. Casino Royale stars Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, and Judi Dench and the film is directed by GoldenEye director Martin Campbell. I don't want to explain the plot of Casino Royale because it'll take a long time to explain and I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but the plot is absolutely fantastic for this movie. It has no plotholes, its very well written,and very dark. Daniel Craig is absolutely incredible as James Bond and is way better than Roger Moore,Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan and is on par with Sean Connery as the best James Bond. Daniel Craig gives the best performance of his career in this movie and he also did a great job in Quantum of Solace and Skyfall which I'll review later at some point. Eva Green does a great job as the Bond Girl in this movie named Vesper and in my opinion the best Bond Girl in the whole series. Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre, the villain in this movie and does a fantastic job playing him. Le Chiffre is also the first James Bond villain to ever appear in the books, but not in the first James Bond movie. Judi Dench doesn't have a lot of screen time, but she does a good job as M. The action is some of the best ever captured on film. They are very realistic unlike the previous Bond films like Die Another Day which had very over the top action scenes. Martin Campbell understands action and I hope he does another Bond film in the future. The film is also very intense and riveting. I have never seen poker games more riveting in any movie ever. The film has a great score although the James Bond theme isn't in this movie because this movie is the beginning of James Bond, but the theme is a big part of the James Bond series. The film is very, very dark and it goes back to the serious tone of the first few James Bond movies like Dr. No and From Russia With Love. The film has a torture scene in it that is very gritty and visceral and I think its one of the best scenes in the movie because of how its filmed and acted. I forgot to mention that this film is a reboot of the whole James Bond series so no Die Another Day, A View to a Kill, The Man with the Golden Gun like films anymore. Now the question is that if I like this movie more than the previous films like Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, and GoldenEye and my answer is yes and no. I think that the action scenes in this movie are better than the old ones and the film is very eerie, but I miss the gadgets and the crazy stunts like in the previous films. I do think that Casino Royale is a film that James Bond fans like me and casual moviegoers will enjoy. I consider Casino Royale to be the best movie of 2006 and one of the best movies of the 2000's and one of the best movies ever made.",

A complete reboot, it starts the series back off on a whole different note, establishing a more realistic and serious feel.  Daniel Craig is outstanding as 007 and does a great job showing the agent's dark side, as well as his vulnerable side when faced with betrayal and loss.  The action scenes are great and are a lot more convincing and realistic than those of the previous Brosnan films.  This a solid entry in the series, and a great start to the Daniel Craig era.",

            "content": "Okay so roughly right after we saw Cloud Atlas, Blaine and I watched all of Daniel Craig's Bond films so with that done, let's begin to wrap up this James Bond movie marathon with Casino Royale.\n\nPlot: After getting his 00 status back, Bond kills a bomb-maker in Madagascar and takes his phone and tries to track it to find out who he's working for. Eventually, his lead leads him to a terrorist financier named Le Chiffre. So Bond is assigned to bankrupt Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game with the help of the treasury employee assigned to provide the money, Vesper Lynd.\n\nAs soon as Blaine and I got to the beginning of the title sequence to this film, I was hooked. This film isn't even meant to precede or succeed any of the other Bond films, it's basically a reboot of the whole franchise. And the result is a film that is very smartly written. The story is very different from the other Bond films and is more realistic and more thought out. In fact it's a very character and story heavy movie - there wasn't a whole lot of action compared to a lot of the other films in my opinion. When I was only planning to get to Craig's films, my brother who has seen this movie and Skyfall said that Craig is viewed to be a very, very different kind of Bond. And he's turning out so far to be absolutely right. Craig's Bond is much more darker and gritty as Bond which is similar to Timothy Dalton as Bond, but he's more reckless, brutal and cold with how he's very focused on the mission, but he's also vulnerable in a couple of ways. Also he and M and kind of starting to be a little more personal around each other which is starting to make her much more interesting. And then you have Vesper who is less of a sex object then probably any of the other Bond girls. In fact she's probably the more human then most of the characters in probably any James Bond film in general. She's very smart and focused on the mission but when it comes down to witnessing Bond fighting the bad guys she can be very vulnerable in a much more believable and realistic way rather then just follow Bond around and look pretty. In fact she's probably one of the very best Bond girls because of how she's much more of an actual person to care for just like Tracy in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Also there was at least some gadgets while not really shown majorly like Die Another Day which was really nice, and the title sequence was just awesome. Finally while the ending may have taken longer then some people felt it should've been, it was done very well and is altogether a great example at how Craig's Bond is starting to go a very different route from the Bond movies in a lot of ways.\n\nAnd that's my review for Casino Royale, while dying down from gadgets and action for the most part, we seem them replaced with a whole new kind of Bond that is smarter, more edgy, very character and story heavy and is altogether very different from the Bond films making this a great Bond film and a great movie in general.",

The characters are dark, complicated and nuanced in a way that none would dream possible in a Bond film having seen the classics. Eva Green really ties this film together by being a Bond girl who is smart, independent and most unusually, an actual, human, character--she isn't just for Bond's enjoyment and even when he gets her, she isn't that simple and when she leaves, it appropriately and believably destroys him. Judi Dench is one of my favourite actresses and she is a peerless M. Overall a really great film, one of the best.",

A plot takes almost exactly from casino royale, except, one key part of the plot is changed for the better! This key part is that instead of investing in brothels and then they are outlawed.., the main villain is investing against an airplane that he intends to blow up. Offering this change from the source material is smart in that it adds more opportunity for action and adds more of a story to be told! It pretty much ensures that the first hour of the film could happen! The movie isn't as entertaining is it could be but it's pretty darn close!! \n9.4 out of 10",

            "content": "Nowadays, the best way to revive an established, well-loved character is to go back to his roots and trace the origins of his past. It worked for Batman Begins, and it works for Casino Royale. I love character-driven stories, and in this latest installment (which is actually a prequel of sorts) we get a peek into the events and experiences of Bond's earlier days just when he was promoted to 007 status. What he goes through in this movie molds him into the Bond that we know.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not much of a Bond fan really. I mean, I've seen all of the Pierce Brosnan movies because I could, and not because I had to watch them. To be fair, they were well-made and stylishly produced like any good 007 flick should be, but too much of a good thing can still get old and bland after a while. This is the first Bond I've had some emotional attachment to mainly because of the range of feelings Daniel Craig was able to provide for the character. He's ruthlessly efficient when slugging it out with the bad guys, yet has a touch of dry British humor in certain scenes - for instance, it was funny when he was visibly annoyed after Versper picked out a dinner jacket for him. And a touch of drama too: he actually confesses his love (and says the \"L\" word!) for the leading lady in this one, as opposed to his cool and calculated seduction of the many women he has yet to meet in future trysts. \r\n\r\n\r\nCasino Royale was well-done because it was bold enough to forego the usual wisecracking Bond persona and instead present a rookie 007 who's just about to learn just how vicious his line of work really is. This a great interpretation of the famous MI6 agent who hasn't learned all the tricks in the book just yet, and is still a bit rough around the edges. He still gets the job done, but not without making some mistakes along the way that will cost him dearly.There was one shot I liked in particular which was a close up of Bond's freshly scarred face (right after thwarting a terrorist plot to blow up an airliner). \r\n\r\n\r\nThis Bond has a brutality to him, which is established in the pre-credits bathroom scene where he beats an enemy's face to a bloody pulp. It's pretty obvious to anyone who has seen the movie, but it's still noteworthy to mention there are no gadgets used in this one (unless you count the skin-embedded tracking device/health monitor and defibrilator). That leaves Bond only with his wits, ammuntion and raw strength to contend with his foes in this adventure. This was bound to upset a few people I suppose. For instance, there was some moron whining on YouTube that didn't really get why they chose to discard the gizmos. On another note, I'm glad the villain (Le Chiffre) wasn't the cliche megalomaniacal mastermind planning world domination - he's just in it for the money.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs refreshing as it is however, there are still some key elements that were wisely kept intact so as not to alienate the fans and retain a sense of familiarity. It wouldn't be a Bond film without the exotic locations, the cars, and of course the women, so I was thankful they kept those items in their checklist. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is getting too long so I'll cap this off with a round up of the other things I liked about the movie. First off, there's a cool twist on the traditional gunbarrel sequence by building it in to the opening credits that follow right after. This time we actually see who the ill-fated gunman is. As for the actual opening sequence itself, the stylized animation showing Bond in action departs from the usual scantily clad (or naked) women accompanying the opening credits. It's a great way of showing what ol' James is best at, and Chris Cornell's \"You Know My Name\" complements the whole sequence (and the film's overall theme in general). It blows my mind that this is the same guy that sang \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Rusty Cage\". Cornell's voice was the last one I expected to hear in a Bond theme but his vocal range fit the song suprisingly well. Who would have known? There were a copule more scenes I liked, namely the verbal sparring between James and Vesper upon their first meeting, and the Parkour-inspired foot chase scene with the bombmaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, and my favorite line: \r\n\r\nBartender: \"Would you like your Martini shaken or stirred?\" \r\n\r\n\r\nBond: \"Does it look like I give a damn?\"",

I think Daniel Craig is fantastic as Bond, but I have no comparisons to draw from. I think Eva Green is probably one of the best Bond girls, but that's entirely conjecture on my part. Still, as a post-Bourne action movie, Casino Royale is a remarkably good time!\n\nThis rebooted Bond is one of those unattainably classy films, think Oceans 11 but without the occasionally goofy characters. And I like that! Action movies nowadays could use an extra dose of class every now and again.\n\nThe performances are exceptional. As I mentioned above, Craig and Green are terrific! Chemistry between actors is a tricky thing, but the two leads deliver it in spades! Mads Mikkelsen plays a chilling foil to Bond. Judi Dench is as reliable as always. And Jeffery Wright lends his talents in a smaller supporting role. The cast offers nothing in the way of flaws.\n\nThe action is surefooted and confident. There is an awesome free-running chase near the beginning. The scene offers little bearing on the rest of the movie, but it's still exhilarating to watch! There is a lengthy and impressive action scene in Miami International Airport. But I wouldn't say this is an action-centric movie.\n\nThe pacing could be problematic. And there's no denying that Casino Royale is a tad too long. Poker games take up the majority of the middle portion of the film. But it's incredible who tense director Martin Campbell keeps these scenes.\n\nThe main flaw present is the shifting villainy. At the beginning, there is a very clear villain. Then he's out of the picture, and character B becomes the main baddie. Then that washes out, and character C comes on the scene. A little definition would be nice.\n\nAlso of special note, the music is amazing! Chris Cornell's inspired Bond song sets the tone right from the get-go! And David Arnold's score never ceases to astound - in the action scenes and in the quieter, more introspective moments.\n\nCasino Royale: one of the most classy, flashy, and engaging action movies yielded from mid-2000's. The other Daniel Craig movies in this series are now, most definitely, on my want-to-see-list! Mr. Bond, it was a pleasure meeting you.\n\n\"I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.\" 8.5/10",

Daniel Craig is a revelation as the \"blunt instrument\" that does the jobs nobody else will do, and the dark, emotional, unflinching journey of a man giving up his soul for the greater good is powerful stuff. Vesper Lynd is probably the best female character to ever show up in an action film (Although it's sad how seldom few there are vying for that position). She is Bond's equal in intelligence and cleverness, their back-and-forth quippery is made of the same substance as Tracy and Hepburn. Plus you've got a creepy villain, brutal fight sequences impeccably shot, the masterful poker game sequence... The list goes on. Martin Campbell's direction is assured, and the score is impressively restrained in being entirely focused on the journey of the character rather than giving us empty moments of fan service recognition.\n\nThe best scene in the film is quiet and simple, in which Bond comforts a traumatized Vesper as they sit on the floor of the hotel shower. It was Campbell's decision to change the script and keep them fully clothed, and in doing so, what would have been a cliche and easy bit of sexual eye-candy instead becomes a transcendent moment of love and compassion. That's the kind of beautiful subtly of character and theme that is all too rare in explosive action movies, and \"Casino Royale\" shows that the two do not need to be mutually exclusive.",

With more substance, brains, realism than style, Daniel Crag with the help of 21st century technology, omega watch, a smart car and Sony gadgets, I was treated to the the best 007 ever. Strong, intelligent, gutsy and striking fear in people with his piercing blue eyes, Daniel Craig was a non-stop adrenaline pumper. Interestingly, Casino Royale was actually the first Ian Fleming\u00b4s first adventure of the 007 series. One learned of James Bond\u00b4s pre-007 mission that led to his promotion to the coveted 007 status. We also learned that he was not always the flippant womaniser who shunned long term relationship. Also his invention of the famous Vodka Martini cocktail was revealed plus the full recipe recited to a waiter taking orders while he was at the Baccarat table. Unlike the clownish and unserious tone of previous 007 films, Casino Royale was very gritty from the get go and also very painful to watch at times. James Bond certainly had a very high threshold for pain and so it should be if he was to be trusted with national secrets of the highest level. Nice to see James Bond had his spell of domesticity and inebriation with love.

His chemistry with Judi Dench (M) was magic. It was clearly obvious, she commanded respect from 007. Very few do. Otherwise his arrogance, cavalier spirit and punch lines injected superb LOL humour.

This movie shows a back-to-basics Bond, after the cartoonish excessiveness of the Brosnan era. Craig takes full control of the role, bringing a Bond that is more serious, grim and reckless, while maintaining a very dark sense of humor. He's also much more aggressive. Whereas Sean Connery moved like a cat, Craig moves like a bulldozer. Timothy Dalton's desire to portray a more serious Bond was only partially successful. Here, Craig finishes the job.",

Green's act of Vesper, marked her as one of the best performances of the Bond girls, with great strength and elegance. Dench still acting like a jewel as M, and Mikkelsen are a great villain. It shows a seriousness during the movie, with intense (and surprising) action scenes, typical of the director of \"Goldeneye\", Martin Campbell. \"Casino Royale\" is a smart, stylish and thrilling reboot of the Bond franchise, with an haunted and intense brand new 007, just like fans and normal audience wanted.

            "content": "http://expletivedleted.livejournal.com/149977.html\n\nWell hellooooo there James Blonde, er, I mean, Bond. Daniel Craig, I have been waiting for you. Pre-project, one of the main reasons I usually named Craig as my favorite was because he was simply the one that stuck with me most. But now, having really watched his predecessors, he's still my boy.\n\nThe quick reason is that I like how much darker his films are. He's more ruthless. He's got his sense of humor, but it's much more biting and sarcastic. He unapologetically defies authority. His storylines are more personal. There's more at stake for him, and thus you see his defenses are up. Every other Bond took a few films to distinguish themselves. Craig nailed his own completely different interpertation right away, while at the same time staying true to some of the basics of the character.\n\nI remember the first time I saw Casino Royale. It would be the first 007 I saw in the theater. It was Thanksgiving day, and I had just enough time to run to the movies before I had to get my green bean casserole in the oven before dinner with friends. I expected to find the place filled with dads and their kids, trying to keep the kitchen clear for mom. There weren't quite as many as I'd expected, but those familial units were certainly present. \n\nSomething else that struck me when I first watched this back then was that it seemed that the people behind 007 finally realized something: girls watch these movies too! Let's face it. James Bond is very much a man's man. The way he kicks butt and beds women, there's no denying that it's been all guys running the show. For once, they threw a little eye candy our way, again with an obvious nod to Honey Ryder. He's also not as blatant of a womanizer. Sure, he has the affair with the married girl (unhappily married, I might add), but you at least start getting some background on him and understand why he has these tendencies. But his relationship with Vesper is a lot more real, than any we've seen except maybe with Tracy in On Her Majesty's... It had been getting annoying how quickly girls would throw themselves at him (especially in Connery's time). Nice that he's actually gotta work for it a bit now. Also, did you notice that except for the quick image of Vesper, there's no women prancing around in the opening credits? More on that later.\n\nTil this point, every time we've changed actors, we've just sorta picked up the story where we left off. Casino Royale is the first reboot the franchise. Or really, you could argue that it's not actually a reboot, more of a rewind. We never really did get an origin story. Even then, it's only a partial origin story in that it's his first mission. We don't know how he got there, but then again it's maybe better that way. We don't get a \"Bond. James Bond\" until the last seconds of the film, but that point, he is definitively Bond. James Bond. And it's beautiful.\n\nNow that we're past 20 movies in, there's so many pieces to the franchise, and I love seeing all of the winks to the audience. Some more obvious than others. Obvious: \"Would you like that shaken or stirred\" \"Does it look like I give a damn\". Less obvious: Have you noticed he has a favorite brand of champagne? That would be Bollinger. Or the throwback to the silly Bond girl names by trying to give Vesper the alias \"Stephanie Broadchest\".\n\nI love Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. She doesn't have a flimsy, based on intense experience connection with him. Instead she really does get thru and connects with him. Their first interaction might be my favorite scene. Such sharp dialog back and forth. Skewered.\n\nI'd been saying how much I love Judi Dench as M. With Brosnan, I just liked her for the fact that she was more hands on. But with Craig, I love the kind of relationship that they have. He's so insubordinate and arrogant, but at the same time there's a deep level of mutual respect. I'm really excited to watch the next couple (Skyfall especially) with these interactions fresher in my head. Also, here's where we \"first\" meet Felix Leiter of the CIA. The first time I saw this, I got the sense that he was important, I just didn't know my 007 history enough to know how. Now I get it.\n\nBeen throwing around the phrase \"one of my favorites\" when talking about the various theme songs. However, I figured out how to narrow it down. If I could only listen to one theme ever again, which would it be. Immediately my brain went to Chris Cornell's \"You Know My Name\". Yes, this one is definitely my favorite. I may even think so about the credit sequence as well. It plays on the whole casino theme and instead of featuring dancing naked girls, there's some really cool stylized fight sequences. I like it because A)it's different and 2) it brings the focus to James. Makes it feel like it's more a part of the movie and not just an afterthought.\n\nhttp://www.expletivedleted.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted\nhttp://www.facebook.com/expletivedleted",

The parkour and hold'em scenes in particular already feel out-of-touch, with both fads freshly occupying the rear-view mirror, but that's hardly a fresh hurdle for the series to clear. Daniel Craig makes for a far better Bond than I'd hoped, especially during the nail-biting action scenes or the prerequisite mingling with the high-cultured elite. He isn't the quip-slinging lady killer that Connery or Brosnan were, at least not yet, but he's twice as convincing when the time comes to flex a little muscle (or leap from one precariously-perched construction crane to another, as it were). This isn't a perfect effort - the poker climax is recklessly telegraphed, and the final forty minutes feel like a weepy, long-winded epilogue - but it is an action joyride, stuffed with clever winks and nods at the character's past, and one of the best Bonds ever made.",

None of the earlier Bond films come close to portraying a Bond this unpolished and brutal. \r\nThe story is entertaining and easy to follow. The villain Le Chiffre is not threatening until a torture scene wipes out any sympathy he may have generated from his predicament with the even bigger fish he is working for. There are a number of memorable action scenes, primarily the opening chase scene where 007 pursues a man with a bomb on foot. It's jaw-dropping and the stunts are amazing. \r\nI'm not much of a card player, but I have to say, even the card playing scenes were exciting. \r\nA minor quibble I have is that the closing fight in Venice doesn't stand up as well when compared to the other great action pieces throughout the film. \r\nArguments could easily be made that this is the best Bond film ever.",

Everyone and their mother has already talked about the amazing opening Parkour chase scene. But what really stood out to me was how invested I was into the actual card game. The game of cat and mouse between Bond and Le Chiffre at the card table was perfectly tense and suspenseful.\n\nI also love the way this film plays around with age old Bond traditions. The twist on the opening gun barrel sequence felt fresh while still keeping true to the Bond formula. And holding off the famous \"Bond. James Bond.\" line until the very end was like the producers saying, \"Daniel Craig is a whole different beast... but he's still James Bond.\"\n\nMy only gripe? The love story. Humanizing bond was a good choice - but some of the lines he drops to Vesper in the third act are downright stomach churning. It's not unbearable by any means but I found myself rolling my eyes a few times.\n\nBottom line though: this is one of the better Bonds. You know, the kind that actually stands up well to all films.

The Bond song is fantastic, Daniel Craig as James Bond is phenomenal, Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre is an amazing Bond villain, and Eva Green's Vesper Lynd is the best Bond girl ever put on screen. The score is fantastic, and the practical action scenes shoot this movie to new levels of great. It slows at the end for a second, but it never loses my attention in the many times I have watched this movie. I prefer Skyfall because I  love every scene in that movie, and it never slows down for me. At times, Casino Royale can slow for me, but it never loses my attention. The first act is action packed, the second act is brutally tense, and the third act is heartbreaking. The movie ties together as the best Bond movie ever made, and it has only Skyfall to compete with. 9.5/10",

Bond goes to a Casino Royale special event to face of with Le Chiffre in a game of poker, but that's only one major part in the story. This movie brings James Bond into a newer, darker world with villains trying to get him left and right. Daniel Craig is excellent!",
