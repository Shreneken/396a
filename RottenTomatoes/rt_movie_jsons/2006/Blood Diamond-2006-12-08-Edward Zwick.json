            "content": "\"Blood Diamond\" is a powerful and thought-provoking war drama film released in 2006, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Djimon Hounsou, and Jennifer Connelly. The film is set in Sierra Leone during the civil war of the late 1990s, and explores the brutal and illegal diamond trade that fueled the conflict. DiCaprio plays a ruthless diamond smuggler who teams up with a local fisherman, played by Hounsou, to find a rare and valuable diamond that could change both of their lives. The film is a masterclass in acting, with DiCaprio delivering a nuanced and convincing performance, and Hounsou delivering a heart-wrenching portrayal of a man torn between his love for his family and his desire for a better life. The film's cinematography is stunning, capturing the raw beauty and violence of Africa. \"Blood Diamond\" is a must-watch for fans of war dramas and socially conscious films, and is a powerful commentary on the role that greed and conflict can play in our lives.",

            "content": "Beautiful cinematography at the beginning there with the shots of the sunrise and the fishing boats on the water. Almost looks like a painting. It's almost unbelievable to think that these kids would go into villages with AK's and just start shooting everyone. Killing, pillaging and burning down villages. Like what's the reasoning behind this? You almost don't want to believe it. The R.U.F (Revolutionary United Front) don't seem to have the right cause in mind. They're just rebels using and abusing people. Forcing them into labor and then taking their children and putting AK's in their hands. Brainwashing them, manipulating them with their lies and ideals. It's crazy how a countries natural resource can bring about so much violence and blood shed, and cause so much destruction. I guess that's why they're called blood diamonds for a reason. \n\nMan, Jennifer Connelly's pretty. Her eyes and eyebrows are gorgeous. Lol I love that quote that Archer tells Maddy when she asks for his help off the record, \"Well, off the record, I like to get kissed before I get …\". That's beautiful how Archer gets immortalized as a hero in Maddy's article. Yeah he died, but now his story and the impact he made lives on. \n\nThey do a really good job at showcasing the beauty of Africa, but at the same time they don't  neglect showing the war-riddled and violent areas as well. The movie is pretty formulaic and predictable but its story is gripping enough to where you want to keep watching. It's not really a fun movie by any means. It's more of a movie that's conveying an important universal message. Yeah the ending is uplifting and inspirational and yeah there are some beautiful moments of understanding and compassion. But at the heart of it, its sobering and heartbreaking subject matter reminds us of how cruel and unfair the world can be. Of how selfish and greedy man can be and how it can destroy a country. So that's why for me I don't really love this movie. This is pretty much a one and done sort of ordeal for me. I do recommend everyone to watch it though.",

            "content": "In 1999 Sierra Leone, is a West African nation ravaged by a decade of civil war. Rebel factions such as the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) frequently terrorize the countryside, intimidating Mende locals and enslaving many to harvest diamonds, which fund their increasingly successful war effort. One such unfortunate local is fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) from Shenge. While his family escapes the rebels, Vandy is assigned to a workforce overseen by Captain Poison (David Harewood), a ruthless warlord. One morning, while mining a river, Vandy discovers an enormous pink diamond. Captain Poison tries to take the stone, but the area is suddenly raided by government troops. Vandy buries the stone before being captured. Both Vandy and Poison are incarcerated in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown, along with Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a Rhodesian smuggler and mercenary. Archer, a veteran of the 32 Battalion during the South African Border War, was jailed while trying to smuggle diamonds into Liberia. They were intended for Rudolph van de Kaap (Marius Weyers), a corrupt South African mining executive and a major part of the international diamond industry. Hearing of the pink diamond in prison, Archer arranges for himself and Vandy to be freed from detention. He travels to Cape Town to meet his employer, Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo), an Afrikaner formerly with the apartheid-era South African Defence Force, who now commands a private military company. Archer wants the diamond so he can sell it and leave the continent forever, but Coetzee wants it as compensation for Archer's botched smuggling mission. Archer returns to Sierra Leone, locates Vandy, and offers to help him find his family if he will help recover the diamond. Meanwhile, RUF insurgents escalate hostilities; Freetown falls to their advance while Vandy's son Dia is among those rounded up to serve as child soldiers under a liberated Captain Poison. Archer and Vandy narrowly escape to Lungi, where Vandy encounters his wife and daughters in a refugee camp, but finds that his son has been taken by the RUF. Vandy and Archer plan to reach Kono, where Vandy buried the diamond, with an American journalist named Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), who is attempting to write an exposé on the illicit diamond trade. In exchange for her help, Archer promises to provide her the evidence she needs for her story...\n\nRotten Tomatoes consensus states \"Blood Diamond overcomes poor storytelling with its biting commentary and fine performances.\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a positive review, calling Blood Diamond \"a gem in a season with lots of worthy movies\". Puig also praised DiCaprio's acting, calling it \"the first time the boyish actor has truly seemed like a man on film\". Peter Rainer of The Christian Science Monitor also gave the film a positive review, and like Puig, praised DiCaprio's acting: \"DiCaprio is remarkable—his work is almost on par with his performance this year in The Departed.\"[11] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a positive review, saying \"Zwick's narrative skills keep us hooked on the story, and the first-rate production values and imaginative use of locations (it was shot in Mozambique) give the film an enthralling scope and epic sweep.\" Damon Wise of Empire magazine gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"Great performances, provocative ideas and gripping action scenes fall prey to Hollywood logic and pat storytelling in the final hour.\" James Berardinelli of the ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"It's a solid performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, who has grown into this sort of gritty role and is more believable after having been seen dancing on the dark side in The Departed.\"[16] Dana Stevens of Slate magazine wrote, \"Blood Diamond is a by-the-numbers message picture, to be sure... But the director, Edward Zwick, is craftsman enough that the pace never slackens, the chase scenes thrill, and the battle scenes sicken. And if it makes viewers think twice about buying their sweethearts that hard-won hunk of ice for Christmas, so much the better.\" Pete Vonder Haar of the Film Threat gave the film a mixed review, saying, \"It's a reasonably entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't shy away from depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a little short. And emeralds are prettier anyway.\" Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle also gave the film a mixed review: \"While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save you three months salary.\" Nathan Lee of the Village Voice, like Vonder Haar and Savlov, also gave the film a mixed review, suggesting that \"De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond won't be among those who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling\". Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a C grade: \"Much like Zwick's Glory and The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond strives to be an important film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy.\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, arguing that \"director Edward Zwick tried to make a great movie, but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one\". (via Wikipedia)\n\n\"Blood Diamond\" is set during the Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991–2002, the film depicts a country torn apart by the struggle between government loyalists and insurgent forces. It also portrays many of the atrocities of that war, including the rebels' amputation of civilians' hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections. The film received mainly positive reviews, with praise directed toward the performances of DiCaprio and Hounsou. The film grossed $171 million worldwide and received five Oscar nominations, including Best Actor for DiCaprio and Best Supporting Actor for Hounsou. DiCaprio received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama (also nominated that year in the same category for The Departed). In addition, DiCaprio and Hounsou were nominated for Outstanding Male Actor in a Leading Role and Outstanding Male Actor in a Supporting Role at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards. (via Wikipedia) Re-seeing this quite difficult and important film made me re-think the film a bit. I wasn´t convinced that Leonardo DiCaprio was perfectly casted in the lead when I saw \"Blood Diamond\" the first time and that opinion hasn´t changed. He simply don´t have the aura or presence for being a cold mercenary. Apparently Russell Crowe was the other choice for the role, whom I think would´ve worked much better as Danny Archer. What was obvious as well is that Jennifer Connelly get so little to work with and ends up just as a supporting character nothing more. Which is such a shame as she is a great actress. However, the actor that does own this film is Djimon Hounsou. He is simply fantastic as Solomon Vandy. What a performance. He is Solomon Vandy. And the same goes for Edward Zwick´s direction and DOP Eduardo Serra´s cinematography. It´s such a well made film and so believable in foremost the horrific violent sequences. But, as said there´s some pieces that doesn´t really fully fit to me. \n\nTrivia: Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe were Edward Zwick's first two choices for the role of Danny Archer. They previously appeared in The Quick and the Dead (1995) and later starred together in Body of Lies (2008).",

There are a number of good and bad things with this film, with Djimon Hounsou being the absolute best part of this film. Surprisingly enough, I thought DiCaprio and Connelly were actually some of the low points of this movie, never really getting out of the generic character traits that is followed in nearly every movie similar to this. I thought that the messages in this movie were absolutely great, and it was pretty touching at parts throughout the movie. However, the cliché and predictable plot really held back on this film having that emotional punch it tries to have. The action is great, and the acting all around was more good than not. The action was sort of brutal at parts, though even that doesn't have as much impact as intended. Overall, a pretty okay film that I thought definitely deserved to be much better considering the source material.",

The subject matter and the social commentary it incorporates of exploitation was also well done. I'd say lackluster action and some curious structural choices (Danny and Solomon talking about if Danny has kids 2 hours into the movie...i feel like their relationship should have moved beyond that at this point) holds it back from being truly spectacular, but it is a solid fare.",

It is likely the latter and this is the problem with the film.  Had director Edward Zwick focused on one instead of all, the movie would have undoubtedly been more cohesive and impactful.

            "content": "I’ve gotten at least some enjoyment out of every Edward Zwick movie I’ve seen. He has a great talent for capturing big action sequences, and making locations look amazing. None of that is lost in Blood Diamond, as he is given the opportunity to show a number of bombastic scenes in a war-torn country, and show the beauty of these areas in Africa as well. There were some sequences that got my heart pumping as we watch the heroes of the film run from one army or another. I did have difficulty at times differentiating who was involved in what army, what all those armies were seeking, and where all those armies were located. All of this stuff that is happening on the periphery of the hero’s journey (that kept encroaching on their mission) was muddled. It was almost like I needed a map and a reference guide just to follow the story. The cast is what I enjoyed most about Blood Diamond. Djimon Hounsou is excellent as a loving father who is willing to fight all odds to reunite with his family. It was reminiscent of the performance he gave in Amistad which I also enjoyed because he adds a lot of heart to this kind of role. Leonardo DiCaprio is suave and dashing as a smuggler along the lines of Han Solo, but with less scruples. I’m not all that familiar with accents from that region, so I’m going to trust that he was doing a good job, but it was a bit jarring. It sounds like he’s drifting around between British, Australian, and something African but I feel like that might be authentic. Jennifer Connelly was in and out of the movie, and was a nice moral center for DiCaprio’s character. My long-standing crush makes me wish she had a bigger part in the film, but she was great in her limited role. As I was watching, I found it a bit odd that DiCaprio took over the lead role as the movie progressed, and became the focus of the story. In fact, I wonder if a movie like this would be made nowadays because it has such a prominent white savior storyline. It doesn’t bother me, but I know that culturally we’re trying to get away from that kind of theme. For me, aside from some of the confusion I felt, my only other issue was forming investment in this journey to get a single diamond. I know, based on size, it’s a valuable item but they never establish what kind of life-changing money we’re talking about. It’s just treated like an entire gold mine of riches, but feels so insignificant. Oh, and I also thought the end dragged on too long because the story they had focused on was done, but the epilogue kept going and going. I don’t think Blood Diamond is a bad film, but it didn’t intrigue me as much as I would like.",

            "content": "If films were rated solely by their good intentions, this would be one of the best films ever made. The plot is centered around Sierra Leone and neighboring countries in 1999. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a South African diamond smuggler who has spent most of his life living as a soldier of fortune and a black-market merchant. He is first shown trying to cross the border of Sierra Leone with a stash of diamonds hidden in goats. He is caught and is sent to jail, where he hears of an enormous pink diamond unearthed by a fisherman taken away from his family and forced to mine for RUF, Solomon Vandy. Danny considers this diamond his opportunity to pay his way out of Africa for good. Long story short, Danny offers Solomon an opportunity to find his family in return for the brilliant pink diamond. While it has the conventions of a Hollywood film and plotline, the political unrest shown in the movie is organic and realistic. \n        Brutal scenes show the dominant RUF forces in Sierra Leone enforcing their horrific tactics while highlighting the corrupt political setting at the time. The film is incredibly violent at times, but it fits as an attempt to inform viewers of the horrific reality of the brutal blood diamond trade in Africa. In two hours and twenty-three minutes, the Film tells a snippet of the real story of the civil war that occurred in Sierra Leone from 1991-2002. It isn't a documentary, but it shows some of the facts and figures of a major conflict while presenting an entertaining movie that poses a question in my mind. What do we place value on and why? For Solomon and Danny Archer, all their aspirations lie in a rock mineral that weighs less than an American quarter, and unfortunately, this is matched on a much greater scale. The Blood diamond trade is disgusting and real. Over three million lives lost to these intrinsically worthless gems. While it didn't hit the diamond trade as much as it should, Blood Diamond is an exceptional exotic action film that has a paramount sociopolitical context.",

En este caso específico fue debido a mi histórica reticencia a ver películas de Leonardo DiCaprio. Siempre le encontré mucha cara de cabro chico y no le creía nada a las películas donde interpretaba a un adulto, jaja. Lo que llamo \"El efecto LaPlaya-Titanic\", jaja (por dios la película sobrevalorada \"Titanic\". \"La Playa\" al menos es derechamente mala, jaja). Creo que él empezó a sobreponerse a ese efecto actuando de forma sólida desde que lo empezó a dirigir Scorsese. De todas formas nunca se me pasaron \"Inception\", \"Lobo de wall street\", \"Django sin cadenas\" y \"Los infiltrados\". Hubiese sido demasiado. Si tengo pendiente \"La isla siniestra\" y \"El Aviador\".\n\nBueno, Blood diamond (2006) fue una de las que se me pasó. Ya tiene 11 años, ya es un clásico del cable xD. Siempre quise verla, pero la presencia de DiCaprio me lo impedía, jaja. Me pareció sólida, pone en 1ra plana muchos de los temas que uno ha leído/visto cuando un libro, documental o reportaje profundiza en África: interminable lucha por el poder, inestabilidad social constante debido a ello, presencia desmesurada de armas en el continente (lo cual tuvo su génesis en los europeos más sin ética según he leído), niños entrenados como soldados, refugiados, trabajo bajo esclavitud, etc. Por eso la película es chocante desde sus primeros minutos. Muy cruda su acción, muy acorde con lo poco que he leído sobre parte de África. Muy buenas escenas de acción, asfixiantes. \n\nEl personaje de DiCaprio es despreciable casi de inicio a fin. Muchas veces habla muy bien su inglés africanizado (aunque a veces tb como que se le perdía). Eso tb es parte de una buena actuación. Sólido. Muy bien Djimon Hounsou (a quien siempre he identificado como \"Digimon\", jaja), linda actuación. Merecidas ambas nominaciones al Oscar por actuación. Bien manejada la historia entre DiCaprio y Jennifer Connelly, es sutil y no cae en tonterías típicas. Buena la interacción entre los 3 personajes. Al final son Digimon y Connelly quienes (SPOILER, por si alguien ha estado escondido 11 años en una cueva) llevan a la redención a DiCaprio. Muy lindo.\n\nEn síntesis, un poco desordenada (quizá por a veces querer mostrar demasiado sobre la realidad de parte de África) pero bien buena. Una buena película de acción intentando poner conciencia social detrás. 4 de 5.",

            "content": "THIS IS A REBOOT OF A REVIEW I WROTE BACK IN 2007\n\nLet's be honest right up front, I'm not a fan of this movie.  Not that it's a bad movie, not at all.  Some might say it's a good movie, but it can't be called a great movie, although that's what it seems to strive to be.\n\nAnd take note...it is long, almost two and one half hours long.  And those two and one half hours take what seems like 3 days to play out.  Some heavy duty snipping was required in the editing room the day this baby was put to bed.\n\nMy biggest problem with this motion picture is the screenplay, which lays out a multitude of genres and asks the viewer to go ahead and pick one...or two or three if you're going for the daily combo special.  There's a little bit of political thriller mixed in with a whole lot of war drama and action-adventure.  It offers up a plate of melodrama along with some threads of a buddy film.  And to top it off, there's some sweet romance for desert.\n\nThe films backdrop is 1999 Sierra Leone, where a brutal civil war is raging and innocent children are forced into battle and grown men are forced to dig for diamonds to fuel the coffers of the rebel forces that are using the \"Blood Diamonds\" to pay for their black market arms and artillery.\n\nNow, let's see if I can explain the plot in one paragraph; a rogue diamond smuggler (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), is caught smuggling diamonds out of the country and is sent to jail.  There he over hears two other prisoners talking of a lost pink diamond the size of a birds egg.  One of the prisoners he overhears (played by Djimon Hounsou), is searching for his family, who were captured by the rebels.  Umm...I'm running out of time here...Leo get out of prison and also arranges that Djimon is released as well. Leo tells Djimon that he now owes him a favor and basically extorts him into taking him to where the pink diamond is buried.  Meanwhile, Leo meets a hot American journalist (played by Jennifer Connelly), and they...of course...develop a love hate relationship.  Oh...wait...did I mention that Djimon's son has been taken by the rebels and converted into a 9 year old killing machine...nasty.  Phew...that's all I feel I'm at liberty to say at this time.\n\nThere are several things that I did like about this movie.  The cinematographer is fantastic and it looks damn fine playing on an HD LCD flat screen.  Djimon Hounsou gives a heartfelt performance as the shattered man desperate to reunite his family. And the visual effects are terrific.\n\nNow, the things I didn't like...sorry...this is like a shopping list...well, the aforementioned screenplay; the freaking length of the film; Jennifer Connelly (although I'm thinking her boobs put in an award winning performance), and the completely contrived ending which had me yelling out \"NO, NO, NO\".\n\nNow, let's talk about the big fish of the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio.  Leo was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of the smooth talking, hard edge South African Danny Archer and, even though it's not nearly the same caliber of performance he gave in The Departed, I think I know why he was nominated. This performance is flashy, with a fancy accent and lots of he-man, hard hitting action...the type of high octane performance that Hollywood seems to love.  However, I kept feeling that I was watching Leonardo DiCaprio on screen, putting on an accent and getting all macho.  I didn't feel that he got under Danny Archers skin like he did with the role of Billy Costigan in The Departed.  I feel that Billy was far more deserving of the Oscar nod than Danny.\n\nThat being said, DiCaprio has become one of the finest young actors of the 21st Century and he's consistently pulled off role after role in the past few years.\n\nCan't wait to see what he gets up to next.",

However, it is undone by a script that tries to pack too much into one film, resulting in a heavy-handed narrative that buckles under the weight of its too-broad scope. Zwick's editing choices are also questionable, a rapidly paced clip doing the characters, cinematography and story a disservice. Action is too frequent, with character moments rushed and lacking subtlety and nuance as a result. The best moments of the film are the ones where Zwick trusts both his actors and the situations the story creates: Solomon staring at his family through a UN camp fence while Maddy takes pictures, for instance. Zwick trusted the narrative to speak for itself in \"Glory\" and \"The Last Samurai.\" He didn't here, and tried to shoehorn too many of the complex issues of African instability into too little space. There are great moments sprinkled within, and the film is excellent for jumpstarting conversation regarding the humanitarian crisis, but as far as a truly emotionally affecting story goes, Antoine Fuqua's flawed but focused \"Tears of the Sun\" proves more compelling, and there are better examples of Zwick as an artist rather than social commentator.",

This movie really opened my eyes up to what was really going on in Sienna Leone, no matter how realistic this may be, it doesn't shy at all to violence, gore or brutality.  It tells the story in all of it's terror and crazyness, all over diamonds.  Child soldiers have never been shown like this before, neither has the mass killing of entire villagers in cold blood or crossfire from both sides.  It's a steady story, with great characters, who are very well played by their respected actors.  I was unsure at the beginning how it would play out with Leo's accent, but he did an exceptional job and never faltered. The cinematography was excellent, and were the locations they shot on, and it all felt too real.

            "content": "I love Leonardo Di Caprio, need I say more? On a more serious note Blood Diamond is a powerful and extremely poignant drama about the Civil War in Sierra Leone with outstanding performances from it's leads. Blood Diamond centres around a South African, diamond smuggler, Danny Archer (Leonardo Di Caprio) and  a fisherman, Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) who are a quest to find a rare pink diamond worth millions of dollars. Along the way they meet and seek the help of American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly). Finding the diamond can give Vandy the chance to be reunited with and save his family who have been torn from him in the midst of the war.\r\n\r\nBlood Diamond is a heavy and harrowing film and by no means a light and entertaining block buster. It portrays, quite brutally the horrors of the Civil War; villages being ravaged, children getting their arms cut on off and child soldiers who are brainwashed into becoming killing machines. The film keeps you on edge the whole time and there's more adrenaline than a Bond film. This isn't a film that I would usually go for, but the acting is phenomenal, the characters are believable and well developed and the context is real and touching. For those expecting a romance, there's not really one. Whilst there's immense chemistry and attraction between Danny and Maddy, neither on them really act on it during the film. Part of me thought it was a bit of a shame as a bit of a love story always easens up such a dark and distressing theme and especially as DiCaprio and Connelly have terrific chemistry so it would have worked and wouldn't have been cheesy and ridiculous like Pearl Harbour for example. I also thought that the film would focus more on friendship, especially between Danny and Vandy. Danny cares more about finding the diamond than helping Vandy, but towards the end they sort of strike up a tentative friendship. Danny is a complex character; you kind of dislike him because he's a shady crook, but there's some goodness in him. \r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio is amazing, as always and he pulls off the South African accent so well. In fact it suits him and makes him sound really sexy (I'm just biased). Djimon Hounsou and Jennifer Connelly also give strong performances. I found myself really sympathizing for and rooting for Vandy; I was like OMG I love him! The only thing that matters to him is his family and he goes to whatever lengths to save his family, especially his son who is a child soldier. The ending is really moving, I won't give it away, but it nearly made me cry and I'm not much of a crier. All in all Blood Diamond is a good film but a very daunting watch with many harrowing and upsetting scenes, which make it difficult to enjoy. I don't usually go for films with a tough and gritty historical context, especially when it involves war. Also there was so much going on and too much action. However like I mentioned Blood Diamond is a moving and powerful film with Oscar worthy performances. I was a bit disappointed with part of the ending (only Leo fans will understand).\r\n\r\nGrade: B-",

But at least, having watch this movie, I have determined I will never own a diamond or any other conflict gem.\nOther than that, needless to say, the story was amazing, disturbing but amazing. The performance from the cast was great as well; I've never been a fan of DiCaprio (Archer) but it seems he either chooses roles well-suited for him or makes roles he's cast in suit him. Either way he did a great job in this film and I didn't even find his accent annoying. I also loved Jennifer Connelly (Maggie), she gives a very good performance in this movie but the top kudos goes to the awesomely, talented Djimon Hounsou (Solomon), he was just perfection! What a powerful performance he delivered in this film, he's never a disappointing to watch, he's so talented. With that said, there are very few films that move an audience to action or commit to changing their opinions about something that they were so ignorant about before; this is a film that we should be showing in our high schools. I know it's graphic and violent but maybe the next generation will feel a little less entitled when they see how the other parts of the world suffer a hundred time worse and how there is normally not a happy ending to every story.

            "content": "Scoring an Academy Award nomination for the acting skills of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, Blood Diamond sounded like an interesting political war thriller.\n\nThe central issue Blood Diamond makes itself clear rather soon which is the narrative flaws. It takes place during Sierra Leone in 1999, but explains nearly none of the context. All I could gather from the film is that there was some sort of violent turmoil between the rebel militia and the military forces which caused an uprising against the civilians, leading to taking them hostage and forcing adults into slave labour while the children were turned into soldiers. Viewers who lack an understanding of the historical relevance that the culture of the film is set in may find the film confusing and be asking a lot of questions because that was really the experience for me. I couldn't distinguish who was fighting for precisely what in Blood Diamond which led to me making assumptions, and I required Wikipedia to realize that many of them were not true. So while Blood Diamond does a semi-decent job at telling a dramatic story, it is poor at explaining why the story is actually happening and the historical context of the film, and even running at a slow pace for an extensive running time of 143 minutes does not give enough time to explain anything. Blood Diamond starts at a specific point in the timeline of the Sierra Leone and tells a fictional story but explains nothing of the past, and considering that the story is not a true one, it is hard to be sure of what to believe when the story cannot explain itself. So Blood Diamond is lacking in the story department and fails to truly emphasize the harsh reality of the situation in War-torn Sierra Leone, relying a lot more on tangible elements than on storytelling. It's a stylish film, but the screenplay is a problem. And there are some moments where the script comes out as rather cliche. It isn't too often, but when it occurs it is easy to see that the dialogue is not naturally coming from the characters. Charles Leavitt's screenplay is the source of a lot of problems in Blood Diamond, and it gets distracted from projecting the destructive situation Sierra Leone by focusing on the involvement of diamond smuggler Danny Archer and American Journalist Maddy Bowen. In a story about war torn Sierra Leone and the corrupt involvement of political diamond trade, I would have thought that one of the least important aspects of the story would be the involvement of third party Caucasian foreigners. The focus of the story is really poor, and so Blood Diamond proves to be seriously faulty in terms of storytelling.\nIt justifies itself better with Edward Zwick's stylish direction. He doesn't justify lackluster writing, but he does what he can with the film and makes it a strong visual experience. Capitalizing on a lot of on-location scenery and atmospheric cinematography, the visual elements of Blood Diamond are strikingly effective. And the sound effects manage to hit when it isn't expected which makes the atmosphere tense and has shocks jumping out of it at the right moments in time. Everything visual and auditory is edited very well, so Blood Diamond does manage to emphasize Edward Zwick's eye for strong imagery. In contrast to his earlier war film, the far superior Academy Award winning civil war tale Glory, Blood Diamond shows Edward Zwick's sense of filmmaking developing well with age as he managed to use modernized techniques to create some powerful and striking war sequences even though they are on a much smaller score than Glory as this film is a political thriller set in a war focused context. All in all, Blood Diamond looks and sounds great with the assistance of a musical score which is consistently subtle but occasionally hard hitting, and it isn't hard to keep on watching thanks to the visual spectacle of depicting the Sierra Leone conflict.\nImportantly, Blood Diamond is carried by the talents of a stellar cast.\nLeonardo DiCaprio's Academy Award nominated performance in Blood Diamond is nothing short of impressive. Working from a role which does not have excessive emphasis or background out behind it, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a role which seems like an everyman dragged into a shocking situation. It is good to see him playing a more casual role because even in that situation he does it so deeply with voice articulation which nails a Rhodesian accent and delivers his lines with emotional power that he is then able to incorporate into his physical acting as to express the emotional state of his character. He gets it easily, and while his performance is consistent with dealing out surprises, it is more consistently great at making audiences sympathize for him. Leonardo DiCaprio manages to make himself an easily compelling lead in Blood Diamond with a performance that does not decrease in strength at all as the film progresses because of his natural charisma and emotional investment in the story, and so it is no surprise when he earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his leading effort. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is the central reason I watch Blood Diamond because while the storytelling is flawed, his performance is not.\nDjimon Hounsou gives his one of his finest performances to date in Blood Diamond. In an effort which deservingly scored him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, Djimon Hounsou steps up to the high profile job of conveying the harsh situation on Sierra Leone through how it impacts on him as a person. While the film itself does not focus enough on how it affects him, Djimon Hounsou's performance gets right down deep into the soul of the character and gives a performance so emotionally shaking that it is just very admirable. Djimon Hounsou gets really involved in the story of Blood Diamond both from an intellectual standpoint and an emotional one which makes the shock of the experience feel all too true. Djimon Hounsou makes a truly compelling case in Blood Diamond because he makes his part both sympathetic and compelling while conveying a strong level of emotional tensity and determination in the part. He really gets deeply involved in the role and acts like he is constantly threatened physically and emotionally which means that he really conveys the harsh reality of the situation in Sierra Leone from a smaller scaled perspective and gives is an understanding of how it affects the little people, and so he adds depth to a story burdened by shallow storytelling. Djimon Hounsou's intense performance in Blood Diamond is one of the best things that the film has to offer.\nJennifer Connelly is also great. Although  she is stuck with the most shallow-written character of the a story, her natural charisma in the part coupled with the quality of her chemistry with Leonardo DiCaprio makes her a compelling and genial presence. She plays out the role naturally with determined realism and easy acting skill which makes her a genial supporting presence in Blood Diamond. Her character doesn't feel that necessary to the story, but Jennifer Connelly is easily able to make it work.\n\nSo Blood Diamond boasts some great visual elements and excellent acting performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou, but they are let down by severely lackluster storytelling.",

Hounsou, as Soloman easily delivers the best performance in the film, bringing the intensity needed for this dire father. DiCaprio is also quite good, completely dissolving into his role and becoming Danny Archer. However, the plot is very convoluted with plot points seemingly coming out of no where, often leading to confusion from the audience. The script is average at best, delivering cliched dialogue that does not merit the delivery of such actors as DiCaprio, and Hounsou. However, Blood Diamonds worst offence is the action. The film deals with the intensely serious issue of murder, annexation, and child labor, but the film kills all of that realism by having explosions the size of skyscrapers going off next to our heroes every five minutes, with out a scratch on them. They main duos humanity is lost as well as their venerability, which needless to say does not mix well with serious human problems Blood Diamond brings forth. Finally Edward Zwicks direction is quite stylish shooting the action with frantic intensity, and the sweeping landscape shots with a majestic beauty. Blood Diamond is an ok film brought up to the level of average only because of the great performances and important commentary.",

I enjoyed the performances from all of the actors in this movie and felt they all got into their characters. It's a well-made movie that has something important to say.",

Sounds like a good and oscar winning movie to me! \nBlood Diamond. The film begins with actor Dijmon with his family and is soon kidnapped by the R.U.F. And is forced to dig for diamonds. Soon later he's free from Leonardo's character and we have our movie. \nHoe does the film do? Pretty good and very strong message but doesn't really do much with the action sequences but it's still rather good and very very good performances from everyone especially from Dijmon. I definitely recommend seeing this at least once in your lifetime",

Zwick weaves an intriguing tale of murder, secrets, greed and politics. It's a disturbing film, but it's got a very good cast as well, all giving powerful performances. In 1999 in Sierra Leone, fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) is captured by rebels and forced to dig for diamonds under the rule of rebel leader Captain Poison (David Harewood). Solomon finds a large pink diamond, and hides it. But, Solomon is spotted by Poison, but the site is attacked by government forces, and everyone there is detained. In the prison, Solomon meets gunrunner Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), who does diamond smuggling on the side. He convinces South African Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo) to go after the diamond, with American photojournalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) in tow, but it'll be dangerous journey. This is a high stakes thriller, with a lot of drama, and some brilliant performances by DiCaprio and Hounsou. It's not a perfect film, but it manages to be an intelligent thriller that mixes brians and action well, but it is a tough and dirty film to watch.",

Taking it for what it is Blood Diamond is good political war thriller providing the lavish set pieces at the cost of telling an equally potent story.\n\nBlood Diamond follows a fisherman, a smuggler, and a syndicate of businessmen match wits over the possession of a priceless diamond. Credits to the screenwriters for tackling a subject matter that could have been easily ignored and over-dramatize. I can't speak for the accuracy in portraying diamond struggling in Sierra Leone since I know nothing on it. It does a decent job in the context of the movie portraying the issues in both the good and the bad terms of it. The plot is formulaic and the protagonist is not one I found myself rooting for. He simply uses the people around him for his own needs and the climax came off as a cheap trick to sympathize for him. I find it hard to root for my hero when he insist on leaving his partner son for death for his own needs. As for characterization there's plenty of it. It's quite amazing the main characters were fleshed out given how crowded the plot is with political commentary, diamond smuggling, a reporter writing a story, a father journey to get rescue his son, and other sub plots jumble together. This is both good and bad. Good because it means something is always happening on screen. Bad because certain subplots will get more attention leaving out on the dust. While it tackles more than it could chew the focus on how the obsessive search for a large, rare pink diamond consumes those who get too close to it and political commentary prevents the story being wasted.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is excellent in the leading role. He's able to portray the many shades of his character as well as the internal conflict within himself. Saying DiCaprio got to the root of his character and making it his own is cutting it short. His south African accent is something he's not able to hold through the end. You'll likely forget that DiCaprio was not meant to portray an American. Djimon Hounsou is even more impressive than DiCaprio. This is because when it comes to emotional sake Hounsou has more to work with. He more than sells the idea that he is a father searching for his son. His scenes shared with DiCaprio are the best moments of the film. Jennifer Connelly plays the cliche idealistic journalist wanting to make difference. She's given some bad dialogue to work with making her come off as naive at times. A respectable performance as she holds her own with such powerhouses as DiCaprio and Hounsou, but not as memorable due to bad writing. The direction is beautiful and exciting when it time for a action set piece. While nothing here visually sticks to your mind the cinematography does it job complementing what's unfolding onscreen.\n\nBlood Diamond flaws prevents it from being great, but is nonetheless a well made political thriller. With an effective political commentary, great cast of actors, and fined direction Blood Diamond is a good political thriller even with it shortcomings.",

The script is quite good even though it barely scrapes the surface of the atrocious acts committed in Africa in the pursuit of diamonds and is essentially an action adventure movie with some emotional overtones. At the heart of this film is a powerful message about how great the cost of life and blood is to bring shiny rocks to your local jewelry store. And if it doesn't make you think twice about purchasing diamonds in the future - then you were not paying close enough attention. I definitely think that this is a movie that everyone should watch at least once.",

This helps capture the essence of Africa, which is also conveyed through a reporter from the united states.
