I understand it may have come as a bit of a shock due to the ostensible deterioration in contrast with its prequel, and it indeed is not the same as a picture with Michael Douglas in it, but there's still Sharon Stone, who gives another good performance. The direction is not so bad either. If not compared with the original, Basic Instict 2 is a mediocre movie which would completely work as a standalone. Among the negative things would be the excessive addition of sex scenes to fill in time, taking away the exuberance of a sex scene in a movie; we can understand the promiscuity of the protagonist/villain without all that. Another negative thing would be the ending; perhaps the producers were trying to leave a door open for a third movie, who knows? To wrap it up, I've seen my fair share of movies I couldn't make it through, but I can't say Basic Instinct 2 is one of them. It's a very normal movie, but it's not THAT bad. I mean 6%? Really?",

            "content": "You may notice that so many of the sequels we've covered this week are past their expiration date. By that, I mean the time to make a sequel to Basic Instinct was a few years after that one came out in 1992, not in 2006.\n\nYou may also remember that so many of these movies are troubled production. Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction is no different. MGM had planned this movie to come out in 2002 — still late, but somewhat better — but then decided they had no interest in making the movie. That's when lead actress Sharon Stone filed a lawsuit claiming she was guaranteed at least $14 million for her commitment to the sequel, even if the movie never got made and as much as 15% of gross receipts if the film were released.\n\nBy 2004, the lawsuit was settled and director Michael Caton-Jones (Doc Hollywood, The Jackal, Memphis Belle) got the job. He was broke and needed to make a movie, but called making this movie a \"poisoned chalice\" and said that \"It was horrible. And I knew before I started that it wasn't going to be a particularly good film. Which is a very, very painful thing.\"\n\nThe movie starts in London with novelist and possible serial killer Catherine Tramell (Stone) using a passed out soccer player's hand to get herself off while speeding through the streets, finally crashing into the Thames river. It was at this point that I began laughing uncontrollably as the athlete gazes upon Tramell like she's some kind of vision and then drowns while she swims away.\n\nIt turns out that the soccer star was all pilled up and couldn't even move, but Scotland Yard is unable to make any charges stick. But she has to report to court ordered sessions with Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey), who she of courses beds and starts writing about for her new novel, a story in which real people all around them are being killed in both prose and real-life ways.\n\nUnlike the original movie, which seems to only hint at the fact that Tramell is a killer or can manipulate any man or woman into doing what she wants, in this one it's beyond obvious and there's even a square up reel at the end showing all the murders and how she talked Glass into it.\n\nI kind of love the reasons why no man was good enough for this movie. Michael Douglas? Too old. Robert Downey Jr.? Possession charges. Kurt Russell? Didn't want to strip down. Pierce Brosnan? Didn't like the sleaze. Bruce Greenwood? Potential actor strike. Rupert Everett? Calling a pervert who American audiences wouldn't accept by the MGM CEO. And Benjamin Bratt? Sharon Stone didn't think he was a good actor. Let that one set in.\n\nRemember when Nigel Tufnel confusingly asked, \"What's wrong with being sexy?\" I kept hearing that same question throughout this movie but it's just a cavalcade of shocking scenes that by 2006 were no longer shocking. This is the kind of movie that demanded to be made by someone demented, someone willing to tell Sharon Stone that she'd have to dress like a cat and urinate in a litter box on camera or fart into jars and sell them to people if she wanted to shock someone. Instead, her scene of knowingly looking into another man's eyes while engaging in an orgy is positively quaint. It's like finding out your mom's best friend is on Fetlife. You're not all that surprised and you really don't want to know the details or see any pictures, but you can be happy for her and wish her well.\n\nSpeaking of that, Stone wanted to make a third one and even offered to direct. Please make this happen.",

            "content": "Jeff Barnes \n1/25/21 \n\nBasic Instinct 2 Review\n\t\tBasic Instinct 2 has an intriguing premise, but it ends up being garbage because it's not executed well. It's: pointless, confusing, cliched, and implausible. The plot of the film seems to have no point and it comes across as cliched by borrowing from its predecessor excessively. \n\tIn Basic Instinct 2 novelist Catherine Tramell ends up getting in trouble with the law again when she's suspected to have killed a sports star. This results in the London police department appointing a shrink named Michael Glass to evaluate and analyze her.  \n\tLaw enforcement hires psychiatrist Michael Glass to evaluate Catherine because Catherine requested to get out on bail. Glass evaluates Tramell. Michael didn't inform to the police that Catherine may be  a murderer until the near the end of the film. He feels that she's going to kill another psychiatrist named Milena. He clearly could have done this earlier because there was a lot of evidence or indication that she's a murderer or possibly a murderer . There's a moment where Glass sees a reporter named Adam Towers murdered and he sees a cigarette lighter that looks exactly like the one he saw Catherine with earlier . In another scene he sees a man named Richard Pepper with a belt around his neck and with his pants down after he died. Glass at the murder scene sees drugs that he found out that Catherine had earlier, and he defends Catherine by saying we don't know if she did it . There was also a time when  Catherine choked him with a belt during sex, and all this proves is that he clearly could have reported her to the authorities earlier. The fact that he defends her so long doesn't make sense especially since one of his colleagues named Milena calls him out on it. \n\tThe way in which Catherine is found out to be a murderer seems implausible because\nIt leads up to Catherine identifying herself as the murderer which is highly unlikely to happen. Catherine gives Michael a disc that contains a copy of her book called The Analyst.  As he reads it, he suspects that Catherine is on her way to murder another psychiatrist named Milena. Catherine is pretty stupid for giving Michael a disc that contains a copy of her book. It results in him calling the authorities on her since a murder is described in her book . She's announcing herself as the killer, which is ironic considering she said in the first film \"I would be pretty stupid to write about killing and to kill someone the exact way I described it in my book I would be announcing myself as the killer .\" \n\tThe film also obtains too much material from its predecessor Basic Instinct so much that it comes across as more of a remake than a sequel. Some examples are when Catherine lights up a cigarette during the evaluation scene and she's told she's not allowed to smoke during the evaluation, which is reminiscent of the interrogation scene in the first film where she's also told not to smoke, and you think thank god she didn't say \"what are you gonna do charge me with smoking?\" like she said in the first film when she was told not to smoke. \n\tDespite all of these flaws I still am recommending Basic Instinct 2 if you want to be indulged with badness and amazingly impressed with how poorly it was made but if you want something with good or better quality, I suggest watching its predecessor Basic Instinct instead.",

            "content": "Lethal weapon Catherine Tramell is back with a sequel to the 1992 hit noir film Basic Instinct. Years later, the sexy blonde viper (Sharon Stone) lands in London where she pays daily visits to Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey) and once again plays a series of mind tricks with him. Dr. Glass is left with conflict between having sexual relations with her and arresting her for the murders of Adam Towers (Hugh Dancy), Denise (Indira Varma), and Roy Washburn (David Thewlis). Despite having the similar plot, this movie holds accountable for some of the silliest moments in the series. Unlike the previous film where she mostly used an ice pick to murder her victims, in Basic Instinct 2, Catherine drives over 100 mph in a car with Kevin (Stan Collymore) masturbating her and drowns the car into the Thames. This over-the-top murder method might fit more in a parody of the first movie and makes her seem like a sleazy B-movie villain. Furthermore, how nobody in Scotland Yard can be immediately suspicious about her and arrest her after she killed Kevin is anybody's case. Even the ending was a bit cheap and hokey, with Dr. Glass getting arrested and taken to a mental ward. Instead of killing him like she did in the last film, she leaves him her bestseller and some more predatory manipulation. Basic Instinct 2 is nothing more than a lame sequel with very little suspense and not much erotic undercurrent. (1 ½ Chinese Dominatrices out of 5)",

Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) now lives in London, and she's just been involved in a high-speed car crash with English footballer Kevin Franks (Stan Collymore). He died, she survived, and while Scotland Yard Detective Supt. Roy Washburn (David Thewlis) tries to send her down for murder, she gets off on a technicality. Tramell is ordered to see psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass (David Morrissey), who believes Tramell is a narcissist. However, after people closely associated with Glass end up dead, Glass suspects Tramell did it, and his suspicions are further aroused when he reads the manuscript of Tramell's latest novel, which is a bit too close to reality... It should have been a good film, but it's horribly dated, and the plot simply doesn't ring true and moving it to London doesn't work either, which is a shame. Stone is brilliant though, but that sadly doesn't a good film make. It makes you wonder how bad the other proposals were before they settled on this plot.",

Even though it did win 4 Razzies, I still wanted to know what was so bad about it and how this film can be worse than Little Man. \n\nCatherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is accused of murdering someone via a car crash (how creative).

However, practically nothing happens to make me care about anything happening in this dumb ass movie. \n\nThere is another side of the coin here as well. Somehow, someway this also tries way too hard. When it comes to the sexual components in the movie, it seems a lot more dirtier and really cheap. More than half the things that come out of Catherine's mouth is just nauseating.  And really that's why Basic Instinct 2 really is a horrible movie.

            "content": "I had really little expectations for Basic Instict 2 because the plot sounded terrible and there is no way it could match up to the quality of its predecessor which already had a poor story and simply benefited from the mix of nudity and thrills.\n\nBasic Instinct 2 is just dull. The entire film has a really generic storyline which is basically a rehash of the plot from the predecessor, and the entire time it is obvious what is happening. And so when the twist ending happens, viewers are likely to just sit there and say \"That is literally impossible, the writing in this film is crap, clearly Catherine Tramell is obviously the killer again.\" The ending is an example of one of the worst twist endings in film history, and it is so unbelievable that it completely kills whatever enjoyment audiences may have been having up until now.\n Anyone who has seen Basic Instinct will know the true nature behind Basic Instinct 2 and the fact that the killer is right in front of your eyes. And so why a film wastes its entire time with something that is obvious after the preceding film already did the exact same thing is completely senseless. To put it blankly, the film's title dictates that it a very basic feature and it is a terrible sequel to a film which was good, but not great.\nBasic Instinct 2 defies what made Basic Instinct important and simply sinks into being another example of a terrible sequel. Basic Instinct was interesting not because of the plot, but because of the theme of how the protagonist developed a relentless sexual obsession with the manipulative Catherine Tramell and how he became less and less sane as the story unravelled and he became more and more involved in a murder case where she is the main suspect. In Basic Instinct 2, we see a pathetic protagonist who evokes memories of the character played by Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct and simply dissolves into the repetitive and mediocre writing that the film suffers under. The protagonist is played by David Morrissey  who proves in his role that he has the ambition, but he just needs better material to work with. Facing a terrible character to work with and lacklustre direction from Michael Caton-Jones which essentially ended his career as a filmmaker, David Morrissey simply does all he can. He faces severe limitations, but he ends up giving a decent, if repetitive performance. Unfortunately, he along with the entire cast faces the weakness of not only poor direction, but a terrible lacklustre script.\nThe script in Basic Instinct 2 is memorable simply because it is too rude. There is too much course language in the film with the actors saying f*ck at every second from the start of the film, and then from there it loses its swearing but gains no intelligence and dissolves into an endless path of poor dialogue on a repetitive streak until the end of the long and boring 116 minutes have finally come to an end.\nFrankly, practically everything is wrong with Basic Instinct 2. It is an unnecessary sequel which isn't nearly as sexy or thrilling as its predecessor, and it manages to top Basic Instinct only in having a more absurd plot than its predecessor. The writing is terrible, the direction is terrible, and frankly the film is simply set up to fail from the beginning. The only potential the film really had came from the quantity of nudity and the characterisation of its sexy antagonist, Catherine Tramell. So most of the entertainment in Basic Instinct 2 rests on how the film treats Sharon Stone and her performance. \nThe film doesn't treat her well because it barely offers her enough situations to show off her seductive and dark side at the same time, instead relying more solely on her dark character elements in a very repetitive way the whole film. The film barely gives her enough screen time as well, so it gets to caught up in its own senselessness and indulgence to really capitalise on the character it maintains that makes it stand out from other thriller films.\nSo from there, the only thing that has potentially in Basic Instinct 2 is the performance of Sharon Stone.\nSharon Stone's performance is streets behind the quality of her performance in the first Basic Instinct, but she does the necessary job to pass. Although, she does have some seriously weak moments. When Sharon Stone says \"I'm traumatised\" she shows that she is as worried as Kristen Stewart when realising she has run out of M&Ms. So that is an example of a weak moment, but as far as she goes for the majority of the film she does enough to pass. She debated with the producers of the film about how much nudity she should have incorporated into Basic Instinct 2 with it being her opinion that there should be more, and considering the fact that its predecessor was one of the most sexy yet thrilling films in the erotic thriller genre, it is only sensible that Basic Instinct 2 follow in its footsteps. And while unfortunately that is not the case, Sharon Stone is still very sexy in Basic Instinct 2. She doesn't have much screen time or show off her body much, but when she does it is undeniably sexy, and when that matches the darkly sadistic characteristics of her performance, the result is a sexually appealing and dark performance which succeeds even if it doesn't match up to the quality of her first performance as Catherine Tramell. While Sharon Stone is not at her best in Basic Instinct 2, she has enough sex appeal and sadism in her performance to overshadow the quality of the film itself. She has her bumps, but she is most definitely the best aspect of the film because she at least makes the film feel a little more genuine.\n\nBut aside from Sharon Stone's presence. Basic Instinct 2 is an example of a ridiculously senseless thriller which is short on erotic themes and insufficient in thrills or a sensible plot which begins randomly and charters through dull and repetitive territory until it finally comes to an end with an unsatisfying final act. Basic Instinct 2 is a bad film and an even worse sequel.",

The story isn't that great and Sharon stone should definitely move on to some other projects better suited for her quite enjoyable acting skills.",

And the rest of the cast really does not have any chemistry or offer anything as well. David Morrissey is a cute face but nothing more. Sharon Stone for almost 50 still looks beautiful and has raging sex appeal..Not to crazy on her hair and wardrobe though. This movie is a product of today, not the 90's.",

            "content": "Basic Instinct 2 has to be one of the goofiest erotic films ever made, as well as being one of the most ludicrous thrillers ever made. Upon release it was met with total disdain from both critics and audiences alike, won multiple Razzie awards (Which included a \"Worst Screen Couple\" award for Sharon Stone's breasts), and it is also among the worst-reviewed films in the history of Rotten Tomatoes thanks to an utterly dismal 7% Fresh on this site.\n\nOn top of all those other things, countless viewers were already scrutinizing a sequel a whopping 14 years after its predecessor, combined with Sharon Stone being much older made the film doomed to fail. It will certainly be regarded as a career disappointment for everyone involved whenever they reflect back on their careers.\n\nYes, everything told to you about this film is true. In fact, it would be in your best interests to simply never watch this sequel. It certainly doesn't match up to its cult classic predecessor which is one of the greatest trash films ever made, and will only lead to heartbreak and bitter disappointment from fans of the original.\n\nThat being said, I had a hell of a good time with this wacky erotic thriller. It's not nearly as fun as its predecessor, but for a B-movie fan like myself, Basic Instinct 2 still provided the trashy entertainment that I sought from it. I found it to be a sexy, stylish, and hilariously stupid good time.\n\nCatherine Tramell is now living in London, but soon starts up trouble again when she is involved a car crash. During the crash, her boyfriend, who is a star football (soccer) player, is drugged up while she drives at a high rate of speed. During the high speed driving, she also has him pleasure her with his hand and when she is about to climax, she drives the car into the water.\n\nHer boyfriend dies, but it wasn't from the crash. He was dead before the car hit the water from the drugs in his system. She herself miraculously survives, but stirs up suspicion from the authorities who suspect more than an accidental overdose from partying too hard, especially as the drug in his system is used to paralyze muscles during anaesthesia.\n\nTo determine her psychiatric state before her trial, she is treated by psychotherapist, Dr. Michael Glass, who becomes intrigued by her, and determines that she has a risk addiction in which the only way her addiction will end is when she dies, as well as determining that she is a total narcissist with controlling tendencies and no concept of right or wrong.\n\nDespite his court testimony, a judge somehow sets Catherine free on some implausible bullshit (Welcome to Basic Instinct: a veritable wonderland of implausibility) and soon she begins to see Michael more for therapy sessions against his proper judgment and he becomes obsessed with her. \n\nSoon, he finds himself caught in her deadly web of seduction as he grows closer to her, and soon bodies start piling up. Slowly, his mental state deteriorates as this seductive woman drives him to madness.\n\nThe story is downright ridiculous. I know the original certainly required the viewer to suspend their disbelief as it too, was rife with wacky and outlandish moments. However, this sequel goes above and beyond its predecessor and drives full-speed into the depths of insanity.\n\nIn fact, the opening with car crash should give you a good indicator of the level of stupidity and cheesiness you are to expect from the proceedings. Also expect the characters to engage in very stupid behavior and questionable things throughout the duration of the running time, like Michael stealing a vial of something from Catherine's home and trying to submit it as evidence, despite issues with the fact evidence obtained in that manner is not admissible in court. Or, there's simply the fact that Catherine seems to get out of everything, since the law is virtually negligible in the film's outlandish plot.\n\nSuspension of disbelief is an immediate requirement if you dare to watch this film, otherwise, your head will explode as it tries to process so much idiocy in a running time that nearly clocks in at 2 hours. Don't expect to take anything seriously in this plot. It won't work.\n\nThe acting on a serious level is generally pretty bad. But is it boring? No. However, I will commend actor, David Morissey, who manages to deliver a surprisingly decent performance with such a ham-fisted script to work with. His performance is probably the only legitimately good performance in the whole film.\n\nThat being said, Sharon Stone is still the most entertaining. Her performance is delightfully trashy and seductive in the best ways. She is an actress that truly knows how to eschew the scenery. She appeared to have a lot of fun with her role as a manipulative, narcissistic, deadly seductress and she is a blast to watch on the screen. She may be older, but I still love her performance and it easily my favorite in the film. Plus, I think she still has solid looks, including some decent nude scenes left in her (Then again, in terms of nudity, I've seen way WORSE in other films, so maybe whatever ugliness people saw in her, I'm simply not fazed by, because of the horrors I've seen).\n\nIn terms of entertainment, you should only watch this film if you enjoy trashy, hilariously bad films. Otherwise, you'll be miserable if you watch this film. It cannot be enjoyed on a serious level. I found the thriller elements hokey and satisfying in their stupidity, the sex scenes and nudity are trashy but still sexy, the car crash was exciting and fun, there's plenty of funny moments, hilariously bad sex dialogue, and more. That's where I derived the fun in this film.\n\nBasic Instinct 2 is bad, but as a B-movie fan, I thought it was a good time. There's an outlandish plot to ponder and laugh at, the acting is bad, trashy, and features one good performance, Sharon Stone is still an awesome seductress, the dialogue is a real hoot, the murders are crazy and over the top, and there's more to find in B-movie entertainment.\n\nUnless you like B-movies, stay the hell away from Basic Instinct 2. If you are a fan, you must watch it and embrace the madness, for it is sure to provide years of priceless entertainment.",

Relocated to London, she gets implicated in the car crash death of her soccer player lover (she, of course, was driving). Enter police psychologist Dr. Michael Glass to assess her mental state, and the sexually oriented dangers from the first movie get recycled in this story. People start to get murdered. Inevitably, Glass gets painted into a corner, while Catherine keeps one step ahead of everyone else. It seems beside the point that Sharon Stone looks great for 47, though there is a surgical aura about her beauty (whether or not this is the case). Her nihilistic character has not been empowered by the intervening years but flattened into a one-note Machiavellian nymphomaniac, all knowing looks and come-ons with nary a trace of humanity. The fun in her performance has been deflated to fit the constant contrivances of the plot turns.She gets no help from her pasty-looking leading man, David Morrissey, who looks and sounds like the younger brother of Liam Neeson. He lacks the charisma and primal instincts to get away with Glass' quicksilver changes in behavior, especially in the sex scenes. The most inspired in-joke is placing the doctor's office in London's phallic-looking Swiss Re building. It seems a shame to recruit two world-class actors in supporting roles only to waste them â\" David Thewlis plays the suspicious police inspector, and Charlotte Rampling, looking spectacular at sixty (and a lesson in humility for Ms.Stone), as Glass' more seasoned colleague. Suffice it to say that the last five minutes are absurd to the extreme with no sense of viewer satisfaction over the conclusion.\nThe journey from theaters to DVD has been an unsurprisingly fast one, and the disc includes Caton-Jones' rather bored commentary on an alternative track, and there are several deleted scenes all wisely excised. In fact, not enough was excised for my taste. There is also a disposable ten-minute making-of featurette where there is mention (or dare I say, the threat) of a \"Basic Instinct 3\". Perhaps they can get Dakota Fanning for the role.",

London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in BI1. Again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class -unchallenged. She is \"screwing your brain\" as Catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain.\r\n\r\nAs for the technical part of the film: Only real setback is the B-rate crew of actors. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc in the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better had Sharon Stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma. Her B-rate \"assistants\" are not so bad either although I would have wanted some bigger names to the cast.\r\n\r\nI think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot.

            "content": "I wrote in my original review of Basic Instinct that Catherine Tramell, the sluttish sex-addicted novelist played by Sharon Stone, was \"less of a character than a walking Penthouse Forum\". I still hold that opinion. She was presented as a woman who has rough sex eagerly and often and during the down time talks only of what she does when she has rough sex. She dresses like a call girl and talks vulgarities about her sex life in a husky whisper then punctuates her sentences with pornographic buzz words.\r\n\r\nThe character was as thin as an eggshell, a woman who wasn't much more than the sum of her parts, so when I heard the plot of Basic Instinct 2, I had a faint hope that we might get to the bottom of her behavior. When she goes to trial for her involvement in the death of a Soccer player (he was giving her manual sex while she was speeding her 2006 C8 Laviolette through the London streets at 110 mph before driving it into the drink) she is ordered into therapy because she is said to be suffering from a \"risk addiction.\" I thought that maybe the movie would dig underneath this trashy one-note character and unearth a psychological reason for her behavior.\r\n\r\nThis was not to be. Basic Instinct 2 is a trashy movie from one end to the other that doesn't involve us, it only seems to want to titillate. The point of the movie is to watch Catherine jerk her therapist's chain and lure him into bed. He is Michael Glass (David Morrissey) a good-looking guy who seems to be good at his job. That leads to the obvious question: Why was a patient with a voracious sexual appetite assigned a good-looking male therapist? Why not an older grandmotherly type? Why? Because then the movie couldn't jerk us around with tiresome scenes of teasing and dirty double-entendres.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would love to have seen a movie in which Catherine's personality is analyzed. Let's hear her back story so that we understand what led her into bisexuality and kinky sex games. What is that thrill? What makes her tick? What was her upbringing? What is she doing when she isn't playing out the machinations of a sex-hungry nymphomaniac? Also, she is supposed to be a novelist but does she do her own writing? We see someone reading her book but, if memory serves, we never see her actually writing.\r\n\r\nThe core problem with this movie is that there is no involvement. It promises hot sex, which we get, but there isn't anything more than that. We don't care about the characters or what happens to them. When our vested interest boils down to whether or not we will get to see the characters naked and having rough sex, the movie falls into the dustbin of a third-rate soft-core porn movie. And, believe me, there are better ones out there than this.",

The film itself did poorly at the box office, suffered from critics by comparison to the first 1992 film, won four Golden Raspberry Awards with an extra three nominations and was in cinemas for approximately two and a half weeks. That information alone should tell you how bad this movie is and hopefully should make you stay away from it for your safety as well.

            "content": "Basic Instinct 2, the sequel to the successful thriller with the same name follows the Tramell character to London, where she sets to wreak havoc in a new fashion. The film hardly had any of the original crew as it was released some fourteen years after the original and failed to meet the standards, or even a hint thereof of its predecessor. The acting was terrible as were the script and direction, which lacked the ability the original director had. This could possibly one of the worst sequels that has ever been made and with so much hype surrounding it the film was an utter disappointment.\r\n\tThe direction by Michael-Caton Jones (Shooting Dogs) failed to meet the standards of the original film and let this one almost fall apart at the seams. I only say almost because the film was released. The overall concept of the film was lost as he failed to lead the actors in a direction that would have allowed for the film to be a success. He seemed to let the lines be read then was satisfied with the take and moved on. The direction lacked depth with poured out onto other aspects of the film, which is an unfortunate tragedy.\r\n\tThe script, written by Henry Bean (The Believer) and Leoria Barish (Venus Rising) for the film was weak to say the least. The character as revered as this one should be handled with great care and here it was thrust into a script that was not only seemed rushed, but was structurally weak. The character base was good, but it seemed to be going off in too many directions in order to create the twists needed to create enough of a plot. The problem was that there was just too much going on and it failed to create any sense of real thrill for the audience. In addition, the original had a good dark feeling surrounding it and this one failed to even meet the halfway point the original did. It just wasn't up to par and with that much time to come up with a good script, it makes it that much more disappointing.\r\n\tThe acting in the film was absolutely terrible. Sharon Stone (Alpha Dog) seemed to do nothing more than know her place in front of the camera and read off lines. She didn't feel them the same way she had before and just seemed to go about her business, failing to slip into character. The problem with that is it fails to uphold the previous films ability to create an unforgettable character. The male lead was taken over by David Morrissey (Derailed) who seemed a little out of his element. He did an alright job as the lead, but didn't really grasp his character and much like Stone, wasn't able to make the connection with the basis of the film. He also tended to overact in some portions of the film, although it might have been somewhat on purpose to break free of his character's otherwise bland screen presence. The main supporting cast member was David Thewlis (The New World) and he was probably the worst of the main cast. He had no ability to carry himself on screen and it made the portions of the film with him in it hard to watch. He was just terrible. The other supporting members of the cast were Indira Varma (Bride and Prejudice) and Charlotte Rampling (Vers Le Sud) who did alright but again it was nothing special. The chemistry of the cast was also quite forced and it seemed that it was a film that had the quality of a film within a film. It was just a dreadful job done all around.\r\n\tBasic Instinct 2 left little to be desired by the audience. It was almost as if someone had slapped the entire thing together with the original character at the center and called it a sequel. The acting was absolutely horrible and this only mirrored the bad natured script and awful direction. The basis for this film was not very good from the start and it only got worse as the film continued. It was a sad excuse for a sequel and what made it worse was that it lessened the value of the first one and put a hindrance on the character of Catherine Tramell, making the disappoint all the more severe.",

However Basic Instinct 2 is an entertaining film, not perfect, but awful either, I've worst films than this, and this film is far from the worst that I've seen.  Sharon Stone reprises her role from the first film, and again she is the subject of  a murder investigation. Basic Instinct 2 is basically the same film, but it slightly modified to make it \"different\". The film good for what it is, but it's not excellent, and is worth at least a rental. This is just an entertaining two hour film that presents a different angle on the material presented in the first film. The acting in the film is average at best, nothing special and if you've seen this film, then you've seen this film. The film manages to be to entertaining, but it navigates familiar waters and in the end, you know whats going to happen. As far as sequels are concerned, Basic Instinct 2 is not as bad as the mainstream critics have claimed it to be, I enjoyed it, but I also think it could've been better too.",

When the climax (pardon the pun.) is reached, death is brought menacingly and erotically, (yes, this is an erotica film.) \n\nJust like Basic Instinct [1992], Tramell (Stone) seduces a man related to her case and works her way towards unleashing his basic instinct: sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. (haha)\n\nThe plot is similar to a psycho-thriller but more dramatic and less psycho. it's a perfect blend of themes and it gets you on the edge. Sharon Stone is one hell of an actress and i've come conclude that after 3 movies (which i've seen: Sliver, Basic Instinct, and Basic Instinct 2), Sharon Stone is an amazing erotica actress. They're not kinky but they're sexy as hell. \n\nIf you're having a sleep over with your clique. This is a must-watch.

Just 'risk addiction' would have been fine.  For example, 'hannibal', was not called 'silence of the lambs 2' thankfully, but still it was a worthy sequel.  \n\nBesides that, the script should have recognized that Katherine Tramell is quite older now, and should have laid off the sexual themes which were dramatically overplayed, especially in the opening sequence.  True, Stone did look great, but it just felt wrong and forced.  Tramell is a calculating, brilliant killer/sociopath and she does not need to rely just on looks to get what she wants done.  \n\nThe story besides the mentioned flaws above, is actually good.  Morissey was enjoyable as the male lead and held his own against Stone.  But the unrealistic opening sequence, Stone's age, and forced sexual dialogue are the negatives that far outweigh the positives.  \n\nUnfortunately, this sequel came out quite too late.  If released in '98, I believe it would have done better at the box office.  Perhaps even Verhoeven would have been on board.  \n\nSequels should definitely come out within a 3-4 year range of their predecessor, if it can't for whichever reason, then a new name should be given, for example 'risk addiction'.  \n\nWatch this if you're a fan of the original, it does certainly have some good moments, and the oscar nominated Stone does give it her all.  But I think it's safe to say you'll agree with most of what I have said.",

Let's face it, she looks good, she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such, it never claims to be either. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It's the character of Catherine Trammell that helped give way for this sequel. Fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.\n\nThe cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to Britian for sure. The score is amazing as well.\n\nSure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from David Morrissey who's virtually unknown.\n\nThere's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop. As well as the criminal decision of the MPAA to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty-pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for.\n\nAt the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it, and that's the movie's only intentions.

In fact, she manages to portray her as a slightly more sympathetic person than she was in the 1st film.....as though the character had grown & gained wisdom from her life thus far.\n But, then again, I liked The Colour Of Night(1992), too, so what would I know?!?!!",

            "content": "Sebenernya gue udah ngantuk banget buat bikin review ini film, tapi berhubung ada yang merequest ya sudahlah, gue usahakan untuk menulis reviewnya. Setelah perdebatan yang seru dengan temen gue antara nonton Omen dan Basic Instinct 2. Akhirnya kami memutuskan untuk menonton Basic Instinct 2, dengan alasan jam tayangnya lebih duluan, jadi bisa kelar lebih cepet. Otomatis kalo abis nonton laper masih ada tempat jual makanan yang buka.\n\nOpening film ini dimulai dari adegan Catherine Tramell (Sharone Stone) nyetir mobil dengan kecepatan tinggi, di sebelahnya ada cowo rada2 teler. Mereka pun melakukan hal-hal yang hanya layak dilakukan orang dewasa.. he he he? Waktu tangan si cowo lagi sibuk dicelap-celup ke bagian pribadi Tramell dan si Tramell mencapai orgasme, mobil jadi ga terkendali, nabrak kaca (yah film maker hollywood selalu mendramatisir adegan kecelakaan mobil dengan cara mobil ngebut nabrak etalase toko yang terbuat dari kaca. Biar bunyi krompyang kali yah?) trus melaju sampe nyebur ke laut.\n\nDi laut, Tramell berusaha nyelametin cowo teler itu, tapi ga berhasil. Sehingga dia cuma menyelamatkan diri sendiri, namun dia malah dijadikan tersangka pembunuh si cowo teler itu yang ternyata seorang pemain bola.. Mudah-mudahan bukan atlit World Cup 2006 ini yah :p\n\nFilm ini lebih ke arah manipulating mind. Di mana sampai akhir film ini pun kita ga pernah tau siapa pembunuh dari serangkaian orang-orang yang mati di sekitar kehidupan Tramell. Bisa jadi Tramell memang si pembunuhnya atau detektif Roy Washburn.\nTramell adalah seorang novelist, yang dapat memanipulasi pikiran orang-orang di sekitarnya agar bisa berlaku seperti yang dia inginkan dan mempengaruhi orang-orang agar percaya apa yang Tramell ingin agar orang-orang percaya. Korban paling parah yang sampai harus masuk rumah sakit jiwa justru adalah psikiaternya sendiri, Kevin Franks.\n\nAwalnya Kevin Franks berlaku sebagai analis Tramell, namun justru Tramell yang berhasil mengorek kehidupan Franks dan mempengaruhi pikiran Franks. Dimulai dari bagaimana keinginan-keinginan hasrat seksualnya dilampiaskan (duh udah kaya? kambing yak). Dari situ mulai deh orang-orang di sekitar Tramell dan Frank pada tewas satu per satu. Dimulai dari Adam Towers, reporter majalah yang pernah mengulas mengenai detektif Washburn tapi disamarkan jadi Detektif X (mungkin biar ga ada yang komplen kaya? yg pada kebakaran jenggot waktu baca blog gue sebelum nama-nama disensor) yang diduga sering membuat barang bukti palsu kalau lagi benar-benar berkeinginan menjerumuskan si penjahat. Di situ penonton dibiarkan menabak-nebak pelakunya, antara:\n\n- Mantan Istri Frank, Denise Glass, yang memang memiliki affair dengan Towers\n- Frank, yang akan dijadikan bahan tulisan Towers, mengenai perlindungannya terhadap Chevas, penjahat yang merangkap pasiennya.\n- Tramell, yang ternyata juga punya affair dengan Towers\n- Roy Washburn, yang diduga memiliki dendam atas tulisan Towers\n\nSampai jatuh korban berikutnya, yaitu Denise Glass yang mati di kamar mandi umum, pada kasus ini Frank hampir jadi tersangka. Karena motifnya kuat, dibuat kondisi Frank ribut dengan Glass di tempat umum, kondisi seolah-olah Glass ingin melaporkan Frank karena diduga pernah melakukan kesaksian palsu di pengadilan? pokoknya dibuat sedemikian rupa sehingga orang bisa berprasangka bahwa Frank memang pelakunya (duh kaya? siapa yah, yg pinter banget merancang kondisi seperti ini :-?:-?)\n\nDuh gue ngantuk banget nih.. kayaknya reviewnya ga sampe selesai deh.. intinya sih apa pun yang diomongkan Tramell serba membingungkan, karena dia bisa bikin orang yakin dan melakukan apa yang dia mau. Sampe Frank sendiri sangsi mana yang harus dia percaya Washburn atau Tramell. Sampai waktu Frank udah masuk RSJ, Tramell ngunjungin, dan berhasil memanipulasi pikiran Frank lagi, bahwa Frank yang melakukan pembunuhan itu semua. Jadi binun sendiri deh si Frank itu.\n\nTramell membuat kisah pembunuhan itu di novelnya yang berjudul the analyst.\n\nUdah ah kelar.. walaupun gantung?\n\nSengegantung waktu Frank lagi berbuat sama Michelle Broadwin, ingin mempraktekan cara berbuat yang ada di novelnya Tramell, tiba-tiba mantan isti Frank telpon, ngasih tau kalo Towers terbunuh?\n\nYah emang rada maksa sih ceritanya.. seakan-akan semua affair nyambung, semua pembunuhan nyambung motifnya, yah ga jauh beda deh sama hidup kita.. sesuatu yang seolah-olah ga berkaitan jadi serba nyambung. Orang ngirim message ga mutu yang bikin gue mual, malah bisa manipulasi pikiran orang lain dan malah jadi orang yang dibela abis-abisan sampe ngorbanin pasangan sendiri? yah something like that lah?\n\nSaking memuakkannya gue muntah lagi sampai rumah setelah nonton film ini, mengingatkan mualnya gue waktu baca message itu? kok bisa ya orang memanipulasi pikiran orang lain dengan mudahnya?",

Stone reprises her role as the trashy novelist Catherine Tramell who may be a psycho killer or may just be really good in bed. This time it's Morrissey who gets to take her class of sex and death 101. \r\nLike the original, the plot is pure pulp mystery only not quite as well thought out. However Morrissey is definitely no Michael Douglas and just seems, well, a little too British to be getting mixed up in all these sort of shenanigans. Stone is adequate in the role which made her career. She doesn't flash as much flesh in this movie, in fact, the sexual content of the film is considerably toned down from the original, presumably they were worried that Sharon may break a hip or something. \r\nDavid Thewlis looks drunk throughout the whole film and a host of BBC drama regulars pop up here and there, being British and stiff. Joe Ezterhas at least wrote a commendable script for the original and had some great dialogue. Here we're left with tedious exchanges such as \"Am I right?\", \"Would it bother you if I was?\", \"Would it bother you if I wasn't?\". Everyone answers a question with another freakin question!!! \r\nThe whole film does border on the ludicrous but yet it doesn't make you want to immediately turn it off, there is at least enough intrigue to keep the audience interested until the end. The climax however is even more ambiguous than in the original. Did she do it?, did he do it?, did the other bloke do it? did Michael Douglas do it? Do we even care?",

Sharon Stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and \"touch\" since \"Basic instinct\". I voted this film 10 and I tell you why: Game opens in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in BI1. Again she proves to be a mastermind manipulator of her own class -unchallenged. She is \"screwing your brain\" as Catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain.\r\n\r\nAs for the technical part of the film: Only real setback is the B-rate crew of actors. Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc in the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better had Sharon Stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma. Her B-rate \"assistants\" are not so bad either although I would have wanted some bigger names to the cast.\r\n\r\nI think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot. I think this is a far better thriller than many of the run-off-the-mill crap Hollywood so readily distributes these days. The plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you don't snore in the half way through the film and most important -the heath is on.",

I had to watch this movie about two more times to be able to sort it all out.  Being a screenwriter and a wannabee producer - I would have scripted this a bit differently.  I would have kept it in San Francisco and have a now tamed Catherin Tramell getting \"re-corrupted\" by a character who is a younger, male (or perhaps female) equivalent to how she used to behave in the early 1990's when she corrupted Nick Curran.
