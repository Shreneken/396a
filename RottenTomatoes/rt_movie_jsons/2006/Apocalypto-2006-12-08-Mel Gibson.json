He is scheduled for a ritual sacrifice until he makes a daring escape and tries to make it back to his pregnant wife and son.",

I think people need to step back and look at the meaning from a distance. Who's to say indigenous life in tribal societies wasn't like this? It's less about the Mayans in particular than it is about pre-colonial societies as a whole. Really, it's a movie, and it's intended to have exaggeration, and I think Gibson made the \"rawness\" of this movie pretty heavy-handed   in the very beginning of the movie. Just calm down and enjoy this straight-forward, fast-paced movie.",

I was hooked the minute I read about their glyphs. Their astronomy and their number system. \nThe list is long for me! As for the movie? The one scene that gets me, every time, is the scene where the Mayan slave catcher has the baby and taunts the mother. Can't watch it, FF/skip over it, would even edit it out.... Was that scene really necessary to tell the story?\nAs for the rest of it, I appreciate the use of Yucatec Maya language, the use of Native American aboriginal actors and the location. The rest is an insult and completely inaccurate. The way that the Mayan people are portrayed is insulting and makes them look like bloodthirsty savages. They did have sacrifices but not in a way that was depicted. Their art was beautiful but some images depicted are not used in their time. THAT list, of historical inaccuracies, is long.\nAll in all, too bad that Mayans were portrayed in such a way, too bad that a certain director was used......",

After Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is torn from his family and taken to a distant city in order to be sacrificed to the gods, he escapes and is pursued by his captors through the dense and dangerous jungle.  The action is relentless throughout and more than a little harrowing as scene after scene features intensely graphic violence as the protagonist struggles for survival.  The cinematography is stunning throughout, as is the subtle but effective score.  Those who are squeamish will find Apocalypto unbearable, but it's well worth the journey if you have the stomach for it.",

It had legitimate comedic moment's and then pure terror the next. This while keeping you at the edge of your seat not knowing what the next moment entail's. It was beautifully filmed and didn't rely on CGI. Too many movies use CGI as a crutch or just out of laziness and I think it rob's certain genre's of authenticity. This movie does not dissapoint and while it was completely subtitled I wouldn't have it any other way. I have watched this many time's and it never ceases to amaze!!!",

Not only through the depiction of human sacrifice, but also the bullying of a fellow hunter at the beginning. Kudos to the casting of native peoples for a movie about native peoples. I felt the climax of the movie was a bit of a let down as the plot seemed interrupted.

However, his film making and film choices (Dragged Across Concrete [2018]) have most assuredly not been. Sure, he entertained us all with the nonsense that was Braveheart (1995) somehow fooling the Academy into thinking it was highbrow historical fact and sweeping up at the Oscars. Fair play. He appeared to do the same thing again with Hacksaw Ridge (2016) taking some laughable exploitation violence and applying it to a supposedly serious war movie, then throwing Vince Vaughan into the mix. If Hacksaw Ridge was taken tongue in cheek, it might work, to an extent, but for it to be up for so many Oscars was insulting. Gibson's best films as director, hands down, are The Passion Of The Christ (2004), and this, Apocalypto. Gibson's take on the last week of Jesus' life is shockingly violent, but it is not, as people like to label it, exploitational. It's an easy trap to fall into considering Gibson's traits, and if you're not overfamiliar with the week Gibson focuses on, fall into it you might. The attention to detail from Gibson, down to choosing to stick to the original Aramaic language for the film is hugely commendable, and despite the totally out of place slow-mo shots, The Passion Of The Christ is a piece of work- in every respect. Apocalypto sees Gibson continuing his attention to detail in subject matter, focusing on a Mayan community in the jungle of Yucatan, Mexico, in around 1502 when the Mayan kingdom was at the height of its power, but also having to deal with the crumbling of its foundations. Gibson's tale is well told, realistically violent, and once again the only thing that feels out of place is the same slow-mo shots that very slightly hampered The Passion Of The Christ. Gibson has learnt lessons from Braveheart, and proves that he really is a director to be reckoned with when he is this focused. The problem is, so far, for every Apocalypto, we have a Hacksaw Ridge forced upon us. A bit like Gibson's outbursts in the public eye, he should think about what he's saying, because when he does, we reap the benefits.",
