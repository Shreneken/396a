            "content": "\"United 93\" is a hyper-realistic approach to the fateful events of one of the hijacked passenger planes during September 11th 2001.  Filmed in real time, \"United 93\" director Paul Greengrass, stays faithful to all known facts. These include the aircrafts delay in departure, actual take off time of 08.42, from voice recordings, the hijackers takeover of the cockpit at 09.26 and the passengers attempt at regaining control half an hour later.  Greengrass uses details of phone calls made from the aircraft, on ground air traffic control records, as well as actual T.V. footage of the days events to complete the timeline and fill in the narrative of the events as they unfolded.  \n\nWhat \"United 93\" does well is focus on the 33 passengers and 7 crew members responding and reacting to the fact that the aircraft they are on has just been hijacked. Armed with cutlery, boiling water and a food cart the passengers charged towards the hijackers after discovering details that other aircraft had been used to crash into The World Trade Centre and The Pentagon. Realisation that the hijackers were on a suicide mission drove the passengers to the cockpit in a desperate attempt to retake control of the aircraft. Unfortunately during the fight back the Terrorist at the controls forced the plane to crash near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. On display throughout the film is the confusion and the preparation failure of NORAD to defend the country and the panic that the FAA found themselves in while trying to deal with such unprecedented events. \n\n\"United 93\" is a disturbing and chilling profile of the courage of the passengers and crew who tried desperately to work together and fight for survival against all odds.",

            "content": "First, this film is impossible to present as much more than a docudrama; we can only guess at the actual actions taken by the passengers and crew aboard United Flight 93 due to the ultimate fate of the plane and the relatively scant record available. In particular, the treatment of the resolve of the passengers to revolt is a tough one - if each individual were to resolutely fight back without self-doubt, it would be unrealistic, but singling out individuals to represent more timid responses is tough when each person on the plane has their name engraved on a wall and none are identified as being any more or less heroic (German passenger Chrisitian Adams was the sacrificial lamb here, advising complacency when no evidence exists to suggest that he did any such thing). \n\nThat said, United 93 conveys the spirit of the day if not the exacting play-by-play truth (which we can never know). The chaos associated with an essentially unthinkable act - a carefully planned attack targeting civilians on American soil, spurred forward by confusion based around just how unprecedented such an event was and how the responsibility for an immediate response fell to people working a day job. Information trickling in, each detail increasing the paranoia as the realization of what is happening becomes increasingly evident. In the middle of it all, now something of a footnote compared to the World Trade Center impacts and the barely-mentioned Pentagon attack, a group of individuals with no connection to one another fought back against the chaos for their lives. The fact that we know so little about the moments leading up to the crashing of Flight 93, only that those on board had succeeded in a revolt sufficiently to force a descent, in a way only adds to the story. Shot and told in such a way as to convey both the chaos and the individual heroism of the day, the film wisely avoids presenting the story from the perspective of top brass an instead sticks to the victims and the immediate responders.\n\nDoes Greengrass perhaps fly a bit too close to the sun on emphasizing the brutal nature of the day? Perhaps; there are multiple characters that talk about \"just wanting to get home to their kids\". But as for what the event represented, United 93 is an appropriate gut punch. (3.5/5)",

Also, Greengrass seems to attempt a welcome guerilla type of direction at first, but unfortunately gives up on it soon: most of the film is just a nerveless, bland and worst of all faceless succession of airport/ boarding footage and the same information being relayed again and again through a bunch of control rooms and control towers and control centres.",

Going to San Francisco in 9/ll/01.  And as the Central Control booth.   Were getting all these mixed messages.  Of planes being hijacked.  And when they saw from the Tower booth.  The planes crashing into the Twin Towers.   And the Pentagon.  \n\nIt still did not ring a bell.   But, as the passengers, started to get together.  To come up with ideas of how to attack the terrorists.   Then it came back to me.   As they were able to get two of the terrorists.   And tried to get into the Pilots pit for the other two.  Flying the plane.  My memories came back to me.   \n\nAnd it looked liked for a time.  They almost were able to get the plane away from the two.   in the Pilot booth.   But the screen went dark.  And the Memorial to the victims that lost their life.   On that tragic DAY appeared.   It had me.  In my seat.   Praying and hoping that they survived.  \n\nWith this said, I do take the seriousiness of the events that happened on 9/11/01 very seriously.  Because movies these days.   Can just look like entertainment.  And not actual true events.    America never dealt with a situation like this.   Before, and was not well prepared.    But at the same time.  Who would have thought that terrorists.   Would come up in their minds to bring forth.  Vicious murders like this.  And said, God told them to do it.  \n\nI pray to God that this does not happen again.  But, if in case.  It does because nobody.   Knows the thoughts.  Or contents of other hearts.  That hopefully are Government, military and aviation corporations.   Have a plan constantly enforced to stop any other tragic events like this.  Or others.\n\nMy hearts goes out to the victims.   And, their families for all of the tragedy that happened on 911.  God is with you.   And he will never forsake you.  Or leave you!!",

We're simply thrown into the chaos of that day while watching all the reactions and confusion from one occurrence after another. All of that works, and works extremely well at that.

You could get important facts wrong, potentially misinforming hundreds of thousands - if not millions - of people. You could seemingly reignite all the pain, horror, and anguish that audience members felt on that day for the sole purpose of personal profit. But with \"United 93,\" Paul Greengrass does none of these things. He displays an achingly powerful, honest, and unforgettable cinematic retelling of what happened in the air that fateful day, and he does it without bombast or aggrandizement. He simply tells the story to the best of his ability, and he does so in masterful fashion.",

Paul Greengrass has a talent for displaying tense moments on screen that can draw you into what's going on. When many directors handle \"shaky cam\" to display the intensity on screen, they are not able to pull it off for various reasons, but Greengrass is the master of handling that technique when it's used in various scenes. In this film, he not only does what he typically does best, but he also has made a film that stupendously honors the lives of the people that were on the flight. Making a film about this situation (especially during the time it was released) can be risky, but thankfully, it pulls off the unsettling content to show a true story about heroes standing up to stop pure evil.

I know I say that many films have intense endings or how some certain action scenes are intense, this whole movie was intense. From start to finish. This is up there with Mad Max Fury Road on the basis of how fast your heart pumps while viewing it. Unlike Mad Max, though, this is based on a true story. Now, did everything that happened on the plane in the film really happen? Nobody will ever know, but that's what is so scary about it. Now, I was only 6 years old when America was attacked by terrorists on that day and I don't even remember how I became aware that such attacks even took place. However, I couldn't sit down while watching this movie. During the last 20 minutes, I was pacing around my room watching the screen. That NEVER happens. If a movie literally cannot contain me to a couch or chair, then it's doing something right. As for the film itself, I feel like Paul Greengrass was the perfect choice to make this film. His expertise of the \"shaky-cam\" and his wonderful techniques of shooting scenes where government and aircraft officials are all on phones and intercoms in boardrooms all really push the movie forward. Also, there are no real recognizable stars in this film, at least any with big names. This really pushed the message that these people, were just people. Not action heroes or movie stars, regular people like you and me. They were the ones to stand up and try to make a difference. If you had cast a Leonardo DiCaprio or someone with a big movie star persona, sure it would have worked but it would come across as way more Hollywood and less gritty and real. Overall, this is a must watch! Now, I don't know what it felt like to witness 9/11 first hand or even witness it on television as it was happening so I will not know how people will react to this film. After hearing war vets left Saving Private Ryan, I can only imagine people, especially New Yorkers, watching this film after having the vivid memory of the real event. With that being said, this film was extraordinary!",

They're saying things like ''It's bad because its unrealistic, the United 93 plane was shot down, they never reached the cabin, they didnt even have telephones to call, and things like that, which pisses me off, because if anyone does the slightest bit of research in what went on in and around the United 93 plane, they can figure out this movie is very close to the truth. (How far it is legitimately known ofcourse)\nCalls were made, they have exact timestamps of when, they did reach the cabin there is proof of that from the sound from the Blackbox, the plane was not shot down, but crashed as depicted, because where it crashed it left like a 28m deep crater, and you dont get that by being shot down, you create that by flying into the ground with 900 km/h.\n\nNow i have that out of the way i just want to say that ''United 93'' is an incredible film, it is realistic, visceral, pulse-pounding, gut wrenching, heartbreaking, emotionally heavy film. People might say ''Why choose this subject matter to entertain people and make money off of'' well my reply to those is, if there is one thing this movie isnt, it is entertaining, this movie is far from entertaining, its a heavy and visceral movie experience that you wont like, but it will move you. This isnt a movie you'd want to pop in on a Friday night to have a good time with your pal's. No it defenitly isnt.\nAs for the money making aspect, i dont think this movie made much money and it wasnt intended to do so (Unlike 'World Trade Center' which is also a very known 9/11 movie, that is most sertainly a bad film, United 93 is a harrowing chronicle and has scarcely a hint of Hollywood. ) , it treated it subject matter meticulously and paid respect to the victims of the horrible attacks.\n\nUnited 93 is by far the best movie about terrorism, and certainly the best movie tackeling the heavy subject of the 9/11 attacks.",

            "content": "Movies that deal with real-life national tragedies can help to heal, but can also reopen old wounds. For the effect to be more the former than the latter, there usually has to be a significant amount of time between such painful events and their re-creation on screen. With just a few notable exceptions, there were hardly any movies made about the Vietnam War until about a dozen years after the U.S. military's withdrawal. After the attack on Pearl Harbor (except for 1940s propaganda films), the time frame was similar. After the Kennedy Assassination, it was 30 years (not counting documentaries). In light of this pattern, it's all the more remarkable that writer, co-producer and director Paul Greengrass was able to release such a powerful, yet respectful dramatization of the 9/11 terrorist attacks with his film \"United 93\" (R, 1:51) less than five years after the heartbreakingly momentous events that the film portrays.  \n\nThis film is a docudrama which focuses on the story of United Flight #93, which was the only of the four airplanes hijacked on September 11, 2001 that did not reach its destination - due to the heroic attempt by the passengers to take control of the plane away from its four hijackers. Greengrass took a number of extraordinary measures to make this film as accurate, authentic and respectful as possible. His script relies heavily on first-person accounts of 9/11, radio transmissions and phone calls from United 93's passengers and crew as the hijacking was happening. The filmmakers received the cooperation of most of the families of the innocent victims on that flight (including providing personal information about their loved ones), and representatives from many of those families attended the film's premiere in New York City on April 26, 2006. (A portion of the film's profits went towards the construction of a permanent 9/11 memorial in the rural southern Pennsylvania field where the plane crashed. The film eventually contributed over one million dollars to the Flight 93 National Memorial which was dedicated on September 10, 2011.)\n\nAn especially remarkable aspect of this film's production is the effort put forth in the name of authenticity while casting the film and directing the performers. The filmmakers hired little-known professional actors (although some, such as Olivia Thirlby, have since become more recognizable to fans of movies and TV). During filming, the actors playing the passengers and those playing the hijackers were housed in separate hotels and were not allowed to eat meals together or socialize with each other off of the set. The pilots and flight attendants in the movie are played by actual airline pilots and flight attendants. The civilian air traffic controllers and airport tower staff, as well as some of the military personnel in the movie, are played by a combination of people who actually do those jobs and some who participated in the events depicted in the film. The largest role filled by someone playing himself was that of Ben Sliney, the FAA National Operations Manager on 9/11. It was his first day in his new job.  \n\nAfter some brief introductory scenes, most of the story plays out in real time, from the perspective of that doomed United Airlines flight. As the terrorists make final preparations for their suicide mission, the crew and then the passengers board the plane and Sliney and others arrive at work, Greengrass pulls the camera back and lets the actors improvise dialog. This all gives us just enough of a sense of time and place, as well as who these people were, and reminds us that 9/11 started off as a very ordinary day.\n\nAs the major events of 9/11 begin to unfold, we see normal activity in FAA and in military facilities, in an airport control tower in Newark and in air traffic control centers in New York, Boston and Cleveland - the center monitoring United 93 at the time that we now know it was being taken over and re-routed by the hijackers. The script keeps its focus on the ordinary people involved in these events, but, mostly on the individuals and events aboard United 93. We don't see any famous faces and the only airplane that we see from the inside is that of the film's title. We observe the major events of that day as they unfolded in each of these locations, with all the shock, horror, confusion and heroism from that day.\n\n\"United 93\" is simply a tremendous achievement in filmmaking. The movie's script, cinematography and performances combine to create authenticity on screen and tension in the viewer, but the film never becomes exploitive. Greengrass and his cast seamlessly blend the performances to the extent that it is nearly impossible to tell the difference between the professional actors, those paying tribute to a variety of heroic individuals and the people recreating their own experiences from that horrible day. The viewer is made to feel as if he or she is right there - in the room or on the plane as these things are actually happening. As the story careens towards its horrifying real-life conclusion, many people watching the movie find themselves desperately hoping, even actively willing, that the story will end differently than how we know it does. THAT'S impressive filmmaking - and a fitting tribute to the nearly 2,000 innocent lives we lost on September 11, 2001. \"United 93\" is a film that I will never forget, depicting a day and a story that none of us should ever forget.",

            "content": "So good, but so stressful.  So during the plane hijackings on 9/11/2001, three out of the four planes hit their intended targets.  This is the story about the one plane that didn't, and the heroic actions taken by the passengers that prevented the plane from reaching the White House.  Just being honest here, I've been putting off watching this for 9 years now.  It is very upsetting material, and from what I heard, this was the best made one on the subject matter.  I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit to watch this, given that I was well aware that this was going to be such an overwhelming experience, but a list has no sympathy in that department, and given that is featured on the 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, there was no time like this past weekend to jump right in.  Believe it or not, I'm not actually the biggest Paul Greengrass fan; I love Captain Phillips, but his overuse of shaky camera when there's no reason to have it usually leads to a disconnect with me, namely with the Bourne series.  There are always exceptions to the rule, and this is a giant exception.  There's two buttons you should know about me: 1. I have this thing about plane crashes.  I'm not even afraid of flying, but watching portrayals/live footage of plane crashes causes the heightening of all of my senses, which makes me totally submit myself to the scene, turning down the volume on everything else, and 2. I have this thing about self-sacrifice.  It gets an emotional reaction out of me, and it usually wins instant points.  It's almost unfair to pit this movie against me, as this features both of these elements in such excess.  This was one of the most emotionally draining experiences I have ever put myself through.  I was nervous on pins and needles the entire time I watched this, forgetting to breathe through a number of the sequences.  Even though you already know the end result, this keeps you engaged not only because of the excellent performances, but also because it gives you a great timeline on how it all went down on this fateful morning.  I do like the decision to go with a cast of unknowns; if I was looking at a big famous actor leading the charge, it would very likely yank me out of the film.  Looking at these people who I've never seen before deliver such top notch performances allowed me to really stay in the moment.  This is a claustrophobic masterpiece that I'm not likely to watch again any time soon.",

Hailed as the worst terrorist attack ever, the world stopped and we all felt a sheer disbelief at the events of those day. Now although since then barrage upon barrage of controversy and conspiracy theory now shrouds the events of those day and to what extent of their true nature it really depends on who you speak to. However  United 93 isnt hear to lecture us on government plans, terrorist organisations and conspiracy, it exists solely to recreate the experience we all felt that day and more importantly the effect of everyone involved. United 93 is not an enjoyable movie, this is not a fitting dedication to the atrocity, this is outright stressful to watch. Basically we jump between the terrorist attackers of UN93, the air force, the FAA and the regional air traffic controllers who were on duty that morning, where 4 US commercial planes were taken from the pilots and used as missiles into the Twin Towers, Pentagon and in this films case the botched Plane that crash landed due to passenger interfierence. Paul Greengrass sticks with his hand cam style which adds a sense of realism and immersion for a piece that could easily be approached in the wrong way. This style makes you feel like a participant rather that a film goer, to that we must give it credit, this film is truly immersive and even though we know the outcome, we still sit praying the last surviving plane makes it out alive. Luckily Greengrass also decides not to focus heavily on any designated character, rather he gathers huge ensemble actors, to play out the very realistic and spiralling out of control sequences, hats off to him for orchestrating such a feat and not coming across as one sided or ham fisted. Even the terrorists, although clearly the bad guys, still feel human and their actions completely believable, rather than typical antagonist stereotype. Because of all this though, the film suspends the movement of time, meaning that what essentially is just under 2 hours worth of film, feels like an enternity to end because you are so stressed out while watching it. There is so much going on it helps that it bounces between the segments we need to seen, however the film does spend an awful lot of time gearing up, its not a major gripe but it would have been interesting to see this film play out solely from the perspective of the flight itself. Thus cutting some time off and honing in the experience. that aside it captures everything in an honest and as unoffensive manner as possible. I condone this, too many films are quick to fly on the almighty America band wagon and its good to see someone take a more human and less gung ho attitude towards the subject matter. It's tasteful and stressful and definately not a film i would watch over and over. However as a harsh reminder of a horrible time, this film pretty much hits the nail on the head.",

            "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, a firm contradiction to the classic statement, \"Divided we fall, united we stand\", because this thing is going down no matter what. Man, that's absolutely horrible, and I apologize for not helping myself, but hey, as of this review, it's been nearly thirteen years, so a lack of sensitivity isn't as nerve-racking as it was when this film came out, only five years after 9/11. It's Paul Greengrass, so you know that you're in for action, action and even more action, which, you know, shouldn't be offensive in the least. Well, Greengrass has always had something of a dry taste in action, so maybe we should be less worried about him getting carried away with spectacle when talking about subject matter as sensitive as 9/11, and more worried about his tastes in shaky cam. There's way too much turbulence going on in the \"Bourne\" movies, so one can only imagine how many vomit bags you're going to need on a crashing plane that makes you nervous enough because of which plane is being portrayed in this film. Man, even Oliver Stone held some blasted respect a couple months after this film came out, so you know that this film is going to watch its toes, lest it end up like \"Pearl Harbor\", because, you know, \"Pearl Harbor\" was much less respectful to the victims of the Pearl Harbor attacks than \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\". Yeah, that was a drama which got too caught up in its action for anyone to care as much as they probably should have, and it was still a little boring, although that isn't to say that this film is that much more captivating or, well, thoroughly characterized.\r\n\r\nAs effective as this thriller often gets to be as an intimate portrait on a great tragedy, issues regarding a human factor are prominent throughout the film, and they all start back with underdevelopment, which is eventually made up for by rich characterization, but a plague on the film for the longest time as an opponent to the distinguishing of this narrative. The subject matter is recognizable enough to begin with, but that does not excuse Paul Greengrass' script for its formulaic interpretation of this story, which deserves to not be so predictable, certainly not in its progression, but in its overall structure, which you have plenty of, or rather, more than enough time to dissect. As under-expository as the film is, it still manages to drag its feet something fierce, until it finds itself jarring between segments focusing on the doomed plane occupants and segments focusing on the Federal Aviation Administration's handling of the situation, due to its spending too much time with each segment, and not typically for the sake of exposition, but rather, for the sake of realist meditations upon the events so exhaustive that, in addition to getting monotonous, they leave storytelling to fall slave to, not tone, but structure. When Greengrass' directorial tone goes empty, busily structured scenes focusing on anything from fast-pace FAA workings, to panic get on your nerves, while a number of scenes of overt meticulousness to the interpretation of approaches to a crisis situation defuse a sense of urgency, if not humanity. Very often, this thriller is plenty engaging, but just as often, it's bland, maybe even dull in its trying so blasted hard to be thorough and unromantic with the telling of a story whose impact is already limited by natural shortcomings, because as dramatically promising as this story concept is, it's just so minimalist, with a scope of such little dynamicity that it can take only a couple hiccups in the establishment of resonance for reward value to be lost. There is a fair bit of resonance here, enough so to provide glimpses into what could have been, and yet, there's something seriously lacking and - dare I say - monotonous about this drama which is either too restrained or too scrupulous to truly thrive. This film could have gone so far, and at the same time, it could have fallen so much flatter than it ultimately does, for although this dramatic thriller is surprisingly very underwhelming, what it does right it does pretty well in doing some justice to worthy subject matter.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants to go into this film preaching about the importance of its subject matter, but the truth is that this film is going to have to work hard in order to make its story as an ultra-realist portrayal of the happenings on and off of United Airlines Flight 93 on the horrifying day of September 11, 2001, dramatically striking, and yet, there's still a lot of intrigue to the story concept, whether it be found in actions taken during a dangerous event, or in the horror of the event itself. There are a lot of natural shortcomings to this story, and a lot more potential, and Paul Greengrass reflects this as writer, alone, and by that, I mean that he shines a light on potential both through developmental shortcomings and monotonous structuring which betray the potential, and through some genuinely realized dialogue and set pieces which tightly marry thorough realism and solid bite. This is a very intelligent script, it's just that it is so questionable in its attention to detail over true depth, thus, is plays an instrumental part in holding the final product so far back, as surely as a plays an instrumental part in reinforcing a degree of intrigue, largely in its providing plenty of material for the cast to at least work with with conviction. If there is any true dramatic resonance here, then it thrives on across-the-board convincing performances in a cast full of relative unknowns who sell the humanity of the roles much more effectively than Greengrass does, whether it be the Middle Eastern performers who sell the passion and fear of men prepared to die to kill for what they believe in, or the portrayers of the FAA members who sell the intensity in a struggle to keep calm, or the show-stealing portrayers of the plane passengers and crew who capture fear, comradery and a readiness to do what they can in order to survive. If the storytelling was nearly as inspired as the acting, we would be looking at a film which nails its vision of being intriguingly factual and dramatically resonant, although that isn't to say that Greengrass consistently fumbles, either as writer or as director. This film is an almost perfect showcase of everything that Greengrass does wrong, as director with films like this, from an annoying emphasis on background happenings, and a dizzyingly overdone shaky cam visual style which distances a sense of subjectivity, to an overt meditation on structure, which, in this case, is too, well, tedious to resonate, but what Greengrass does right as a director is also pretty well-displayed, particularly when he finds realization to his fastidious attention to tense material. Highlights in style and substance see some solid dramatic impact in a film that is generally so empty, yet very rarely so lacking that the final product falls flat as a misguided thriller, no matter how much its shortcomings challenge one's investment.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the film explores little unique material, and even less expository material, carrying some dramatic vacancy as it meanders along almost monotonously meticulous structuring which reflect the minimalism of this subject matter so greatly that the final product falls as underwhelming, and even stands a chance of falling into mediocrity, ultimately transcended by the intelligent scripting, stylish direction and powerful acting which save Paul Greengrass' \"United 93\" as a fair and sometimes engrossing dramatization of the faithful events aboard a doomed plane on a faithful day in American history, even though it squanders so much potential.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Between that and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), he opted to do another real-life drama, which is focused, compelling and very gripping. This tells the true story of United Airlines Flight 93, which on the morning of September 11th 2001, took off from Newark in New Jersey heading for San Francisco. On the plane are 4 terrorists, Ziad Jarrah (Khalid Abdalla), Ahmed al-Haznawi (Omar Berdouni), Saeed al-Ghamdi (Sarmed al-Samarrai) and Ahmed al-Nami (Jamie Harding). The plane takes off, and minutes after that happens, the first plane hits the World Trade Centre, another does and another plane flies into the Pentagon in Washington. But, as for United Airlines Flight 93, the terrorists do not reach their intended target, overpowered by the resilience of the passengers on the plane. It's a tale of survival, and it showed one part of that horrible day, which was overshadowed by the bigger picture, and it makes for a powerful drama, which is naturalistic and done almost like a Dogme 95 film, and Greengrass puts his experience from documentary TV to good use, but it's not one you could watch again soon.",

There was never a boring moment, so much is happening at once, everyone is panicking, talking fast and freaking out. Most people know about the infamous events of 9/11, the two planes hitting the World Trade Centre and all that. But like the plane hitting the Pentagon and the bombing of \"Building 7\", this event of that day is largely unknown to most people.  But I think this event stands out as much as the Twin Towers destruction.  The passengers no dought saved hundreds of lives on the groung by their actions of crashing the hijacked plane. The part of the movie after the hijacking was very uneasy, tense and sad, as the passengers cried and said goodbye to loved ones at home as they plotted their attempt to recapture the plane.  I knew about what happened to this plane prior to the movie, and therefore knew what was going to happen, but the movie did such a great job of portraying it it caught me off guard by how  intense it was.  I would have done anything myself to try to save that plane if I was in it, and I felt my rage come out as the passengers attacked the terrorists. It ended great too, and it's not at all the usual happily ever after everyone is used too. I've problably never had more emotions out of any movie than United 93, it was kind of overwhelming. But it was an incredibly well done, sad, movie. It's definatly the best movie about 9/11, and one of my all time favorites.",

            "content": "Director Paul Greengrass is known for his signature \"shaky cam\" filming style, as seen in films such as the 'Bourne Ultimatum' and 'Captain Phillips.' Before those blockbusters hit theaters, there was the low-budget 'United 93,' a heart-pounding account of what happened aboard the the fourth plane that was hijacked on September 11, 2001. The film is unique in that it is one of only a handful of films based on the terrorist attacks of that day, and it's actually very well-done. While 'United' also focuses on the other events of that day as part of a larger context for the story, they are all part of the setup for the events that took place on flight 93. Additionally, 'United' focuses on the behind the scenes operations that took place during the first few hours of the attacks, looking at how everything unfolded with everyone from the air traffic controllers to NORAD - a perspective that few have ever even thought about considering how much of the attention was fixated on the images shown in the media. Once the the action aboard flight 93 gets underway, the intensity really ratchets up a few notches. It really is powerful to see actors portray those who behaved so bravely, including Todd Beamer (portrayed by David Alan Basche) and Jeremy Glick (portrayed by Peter Hermann). While it is of course impossible to know exactly how everything happened in the final moments aboard flight 93, Greengrass and his team do a remarkable job staying true to the known facts of firsthand accounts, and that is a large part of why 'United 93' is such a great film.",

It was crucial that this film was made when it was; with the memories still so raw but beginning to look through the stunned shock and grief at the more-than-powerful-enough un-obfuscated truth of the events of that most awful of days.  David Alan Basche's Todd Beamer does not stand like some Hollywood paragon, yelling \"Let's Roll\" as a rallying cry for every future generation - it is a perfectly-delivered almost throwaway line, easily missed.  Honest and all the more powerful for its understatement.  An incredible testament to the poor souls on that plane - none of whom (apart from the four hijackers) wanted to die that day, but who did the right thing when they had to.  When it mattered most and they knew they had no other option.  This is borne out by the involvement of the passengers' and crews' families in this film, and the reception the picture received.  It is heartbreaking to watch; as inconceivable as the evil wrought on that day still is even now, over 12 years on.  Paul Greengrass is incredible in his courage and his determination to tell the true story of the doomed plane and its inhabitants, who did their best in an appalling situation and will never be forgotten. www.jasper-thedogsblog.blogspot.com",

This is not a heroic story. There is no last minute rescue mission that saves the day. There are no close shave bomb defusals or winning acts of bravery. In that regard this is a uniquely un-American telling of a defining moment in American history. In another director's hands this could have been beefed up with macho bravado or coated in treacly sentimentality but Greengrass insists on giving us the bare facts, evident by the participation of many non-actors who reenact their personal experiences. Compare this to the Oliver Stone / Nic Cage patriotic propaganda that is World Trade Centre and the tonal differences are clear.\nThe documentary-like camera-work also serves to place us in the moment.

Naturally, one must assume that a great deal of what went on that plane that day is pure speculation because who could know for sure, but everything is as authentic as it could be thanks to Paul Greengrass' masterful direction that give these events the sense of immediacy the film needs.\r\n\r\nHe wisely cast unknows in the film, further adding to the sense of realism. These are ordinary Americans, not Hollywood actors. As the inevitable conclusion nears, and the passengers make their final, devastating calls to their loved ones, your pride swells with a lump in your throat and the tears flow freely. You're so caught up in the moment, you pray that history will re-write itself and the plane will land safely. But of course \"United 93\" is not a work of fiction.

            "content": "We all know what happened that Tuesday morning now forever known as 9/11, and this movie tries to depict the events of that morning from the viewpoint of those on the ground working on that day. \r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the commercials for this movie before its release, I suspected that this was going to be speculative on what happened on the plane with what is known from those on the plane who called families as the events were unfolding and the cockpit tapes. However, this movie mainly focuses on military and FAA responses as the hijackings and attacks happen. \r\n\r\nThe other planes which were taken over by hijackers are just referenced in this movie and a barely touched. We do see the results of the two planes which struck the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City through actual news footage provided by the Cable News Network (better known as CNN). Some people may have to turn away when those news clips are shown when watching this movie, especially when they cut to a clip, filmed on video unlike the rest of the movie which is on film. \r\n\r\nA lot of the scenes which takes place on \"United 93\" were, for the most part, improvised by the actors on set. This pretty much helped out in trying to depict what was going on the flight that was not known. The actors who portrayed the victims on the plane, did a good job in their performances, but I can not say any of them stood out in my opinion. \r\n\r\nI also felt that those playing the terrorists were not depicted or portrayed well. Personally, I would have liked to have seen them interact with the rest of the cast they were working with a bit more. Yes, I understand that the focus was on the passengers, but, if you ask me, they stayed too much in the background. The performers who portrayed them were given way too few scenes where they were key figures in the scene if you ask me. I also doubt that they would have stood back as certain victims ran to the back galley to find some weapons to use against them. \r\n\r\nThere is some unique cinematography in this film during the scenes on board the plane. Instead of the massive movie cameras, they opted for smaller, handheld cameras. This certainly helped in the scenes which needed a lot of tension. \r\n\r\nI also liked how certain people who were actually involved in the events depicted themselves in various scenes on the ground. I don't know how they did it, but they did an amazing job in their performances. I don't know how much of their scenes, if at all, were scripted, but they did a fabulous job. I am surprised at how well they did on camera. It was as if they had been acting for some time. \r\n\r\nOne thing that will be extremely hard for people to watch are the final moments of the movie before it fades to black. I even said something like a long \"Geeeezzzzeeee\" or something like that when it was on my television screen. \r\n\r\nIf you ask me, this movie is one of the slowest movies I have ever seen. The first quarter of the movie is extremely slow, and I almost turned the channel. It picked up a bit when they began to depict the start of the attack, but not by much. \r\n\r\nI remember a few incidents of hearing some music in this movie, but none of the songs stand out in my mind. Because of what was going on in the movie, I basically ignored the soundtrack. Nothing really stood out from the soundtrack to me. \r\n\r\nAs a movie, I really can't recommend this one. But, for it's historical significance, I would suggest checking this one out only if nothing else is on television or you can't find what you are looking for the next time you are looking for something to rent.",

            "content": "This review is dedicated to the heroes of flight United 93 who gave everything to save others. Rest in Peace and God bless. I never cry during movies, never, unless it is a true story or based highly off a true story. I have seen United 93 a few times and every single time I try to fight the tears, but they come out. I love this movie not for what it's about but for what it is. This is based on real events with real people and some people who were actually involved with 9/11 are in this movie, and that just makes it that much better.\n\t9/11 is the biggest tragedy in American history, in my opinion. I was in 1st grade and I had no idea what was going on. A few years ago I watched at least 10 History Channel specials on 9/11 and I was fascinated. I don't really believe in the conspiracy behind the attack, but I'm not going to talk about that. Back to the movie, it starts with the terrorists who hijacked United 93 praying and shaving in their hotel room. That was their ritual or something, they did what they believed was right, and now their burning in hell. There are some subtleties in this movie. The pilot and copilot are talking about their future plans and the audience just has this uncomfortable feeling because you know this doesn't happen. It's hard to watch this movie knowing everybody dies. \n\tThe flight takes off from there the events are in control of the director because nobody knows what really happened. The director also focuses on the flight control people from New York and Boston, I think. There were so many it was hard to follow. I just listened for the accents. Slowly, the tragedy unfolds. We get the first few hijackings and the first plane crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. From then, chaos ensues. Most of these people played themselves in the movie and basically recreated what happened in the movie, and wow, the audience sees how confused these people were and they really had no idea what was going on. They did all they could but America was really rendered useless. They tried to contact the terrorists, planes were appearing, disappearing, then reappearing. The audience then sees the second plane crash into the tower and then everybody realized that America was under attack. \n\tI loved seeing the chaos in the control rooms and what America was trying to do to deal with this problem. We almost resulted to shooting down these commercial planes. The White House and Capitol Building were evacuated. The Sears Tower in Chicago was evacuated. Meanwhile, United 93 passengers were just casually eating breakfast completely unaware of the world around them. The only thing I could think was that this was their last meal, and tears started flowing. Every scene in the plane was just so emotional, between everyone saying goodbye to loved ones, to the terrorists being anxious and struggling to maintain control.\nI'm glad the movie didn't focus on the World Trade Centers and we didn't see them collapsing. This movie is about United 93 and what happened on that plane. Possibly the best part of the movie is that there are no major actors involved. There are a few 9/11 movie with big name stars in them and it is a different feeling. These actors are all nobodies and that is how it needs to be. It shows how these regular people took matters into their own hands and risked everything. These passengers are heroes and how they realized they were in danger by what their loved ones have told them. \nUnfortunately the plane ended up crashing in a field in Pennsylvania and there were no survivors. This isn't a spoiler, it's just history and everybody probably knows this. The last scene is the passengers attacking the cockpit and killing two of the four hijackers. They try to take control of the plane but the last shot is the plane going down into the ground. The ground gets closer and closer and the music gets more and more intense and then it just ends, black screen, a soft chorus, and information about 9/11 comes on the screen, then cue the credits. \nOverall, United 93 is an emotional rollercoaster and really depicts the events of 9/11 really well. It was horrible but in a day of darkness there was a small glimpse of sunlight. These people took matters into their own hands and even though they didn't survive, they made the terrorists fail in their mission and made that day that much less horrible. It was assumed the plane was going towards Washington and thanks to the passengers of United 93, that did not happen. This movie has my respect and should not be judged with an award or a seal of approval. It should stand on its own and be what it is. See this move and appreciate how America stood strong n the face of terrorism. Again, this review is dedicated to Flight 93 and all of its passengers and passengers who lost their lives, along with every other American who lost their lives on 9/11/01.",

            "content": "Although incredibly difficult to watch, this is absolutely Paul Greengrass' masterpiece.  It's the most non-Hollywood, non-sensationalized film you will ever see.  This allows the movie to garner a tremendous sense of respect from myself despite the context of profiting off of tragedy.  It's clear the individuals producing this movie were incredibly conscientious of this as well.  What we have here is a very simplistic, low budget film with absolutely no dramatization of the events of that day.  Despite this, it's still one of the most harrowing films I have ever watched.  Although you go into it knowing the entire plot as well as the outcome; there was no shortage of tears well past the final frame.    \n\nThe events of that day need no help from Hollywood.  Greengrass knew that and many frames of the film are simply that of news footage from that fateful day.  This helps drive the impact of the reality of that day even further.  \n\nThe cinematography is simplistic and brilliant.  There isn't a wasted shot and each frame is as impactful as the last.  The filmmakers utilized actual footage from that day in lieu of dramatized special effects, which again, only help make the film more impactful.  \n\nThe casting of the film makes it all the more haunting.  For the vast majority of the audience; they will have never seen any of the actors and actresses prior to seeing this film.  The same goes for post-viewing of these film \"strangers\".  It is eerily similar to the reality of this story for most Americans.  We know what they did.  But we never knew them.  The only casting related issue I have (which prevented me from giving this film a perfect rating) was the casting of a real-world FAA official that played the role of himself.  This just left a bad taste in my mouth.  However, it has absolutely no impact on the overall quality of the film.  \n\nAlthough difficult, I believe every American has a duty to watch this film.  It's a beautifully simplistic film that tells a tragic story with no frills.  It will haunt you long after the credits roll.  Film making at it's finest.",

It is not a film that is meant to be enjoyed or watched over and over, but one to be viewed and respected. Paul Greengrass does a phenomenal job directing, not pulling any punches but treating the subject matter and characters with care. The cast of unknown actors deliver sound and emotionally resonant performances; everything about this film is incredibly realistic, from the passengers boarding to the final rush to stop the hijackers, and it makes it all the more heartbreaking. But most of all, it is the last ten minutes of this film that will linger in my mind the most - the passengers rushing the hijackers, the screams of the people, the tears, and the powerful score add up to one of the most memorable, heart wrenching, yet altogether satisfying scenes in a film. United 93 is not a good time; it's scary and intense and harrowing - but it is a film we all must see, and the events within it are ones we cannot and will not ever forget.",

Featuring an unknown cast, thus making the whole drama plausible, crafted in great detail & retelling the horror event with unflinching accuracy, United 93 is the story about the fourth hijacked plane on the doomed September 11 morning that didn't reach its target & after collecting the accounts from the victims' families tries to re-create the events when passengers on-board the plane put up a fight for their life. Overall, United 93 treats this sensitive matter with utmost respect & is an unflinching, gut-wrenching cinema dedicated to all those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.",

            "content": "Incredibly emotional and intense film that kept me interested and my heart rate up. You know the outcome so it's the journey that becomes the focal point of the film as it attempts to humanize the terrorists and that fateful plane flight that is often overshadowed by the planes that hit the twin towers. The film also explores the people on the ground dealing with the hijacking as it was happening.\n\nObviously living in another country the impact of the events of September 11 are distanced somewhat, though still shocking and upsetting. The issue of how soon is too soon concerning films about 9/11 is in my opinion an absurd one. As long as films concerning this issue are done as tastefully and skilfully as United 93 was they can only prove to further educate about and explore one of the worst travesties to occur in both American and world history.\n\nTruly a amazing accomplishment in film and one I will never forget.",
