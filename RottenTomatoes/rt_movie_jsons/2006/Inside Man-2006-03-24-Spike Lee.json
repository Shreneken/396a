Fantastic cast, filmography and twisty plot (my favourite kind).\nMy family hate watching films with me because, most of the time, I work out storylines, even unexpected ones, very early on in the process. However, Inside Man leads you down a path of prediction (i.e. the not-so-obvious conclusion), then suddenly the plot twists and you have to re-think your whole theory. \nMine changed several times during the film as it slowly drip-fed new information to the audience. Then, when it did reveal its very satisfying reveal conclusion, it still went that little bit further and provided another little twist at the very end. \nLove it. I have even enjoyed watching it several times since with people who have never seen it before by being entertained watching them trying to work out the plot. \nThoroughly recommend.",

While it is technically a fascinating way to spin a heist movie - timeline hopping a little with an actually unusual and unpredictable heist - it comes off as feeling smarter, funnier, and more clever than it actually is. This is one of Spike Lee's few true blockbuster movies and I think he does a pretty good imitation of a blockbuster, but it in the end feels like it isn't entirely honest with itself and ultimately ends up feeling lost in the weeds of its own making.",

Denzel kills it as he always does immersing himself in the role and commanding the film. Clive Owen is also spectacular who always brings its sense of wit to his performances although here he is sometimes limited by a mask. Jodie Foster as a secondary character also shines with a character that has ulterior motives.

The acting was good, but a few characters could have been better and didn't serve much purpose (e.g. the lawyer). The plot felt somewhat fresh due to the alternating between the detectives/police and bank robbers. It was also borderline believable, although I doubt the escape route would have worked in reality. However, the cinematography and soundtrack were nothing special. The police interview scenes should've looked better and like the rest of the film rather than having a tinted/grainy appearance. On the other hand, the visual effects were all right. Nothing was great, but it wasn't bad.",

Starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, the film features an impressive cast that delivers some strong performances (particularly Clive Owen).  And Lee too does a good job at heightening the tension and at setting a foreboding tone.

            "content": "Spike Lee has never been known for his subtlety as Get on the Bus (1996) could be accused of literally spelling out it's message to you but his mid-2000s work has received praise for being more accessible. This film in particular is a clear attempt at making a mainstream, commercially successful product with occasional references to racial tension to ensure that the critics are pleased. I wanted to go with the film but it's plot was so preposterous that it was hard to care and the smugness with which the film went about it's business turned me off completely. Most heist thrillers are similarly ridiculous but this film had none of the introspection of Rififi (1955) or the emotional depth of Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007).\n\nDalton Russell, Clive Owen, attempts to rob a bank in Manhattan with the help of masked accomplices as he forces those inside the building to wear costumes and locks them in various rooms. The case is investigated by Detective Joe Frazier, Denzel Washington, with the help of Detective Bill Mitchell, Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is confused by the responses of those trapped inside the building. Complicating matters further is the fact that independent contractor Madeleine White, Jodie Foster, is determined to ensure that a safe deposit box does not have it's contents discovered. She works for the mysterious owner of the bank, Arthur Case, Christopher Plummer, whose possessions are inside in the safe deposit box and he refuses to tell her exactly what is inside the box. A late breaking twist turns our understanding of events on it's head.\n\nSadly the lead up to this twist drags on for far too long to hold our interest and the twist itself is disappointing as there are so many obvious plot holes that you can't help feeling cheated. Why would Case have kept the incriminating document and the diamonds? Who is White and what are her motivations? Not to mention the fact that the security cameras should have captured those in the bank before the robbery. Films that invest us enough in their concept during the first half are generally capable of shocking us with a twist but because I was never engaged it landed with a thud. Lee's execution of the reveal was also awkward as we see the opening scene of Owen speaking smugly to camera before he reveals information that comes out of field. We are angered as the film has set up it's premise as though the information he has provided us with would allow us to understand the ending but this is not true at all. When the out of nowhere twist arrives it has little relation to what we have learnt so there is no cleverness to the set up and it isn't gratifying.\n\nThe chaotic shooting style that Lee adopts also hinders the film rather than raising it above the average film within it's genre. When they witness the various hostages inside the bank getting dragged around or Frazier rushing around outside we get over the top camerawork that confuses the audience rather than involving them in the events occurring. I wanted to feel excitement as a group of hostages in jumpsuits screamed and various guns were pressed against various temples but I felt a surprising amount of apathy despite the considerable violence on displaying. The leery attitude that Lee takes towards women was also on display as all women were either sex objects or old, overweight women to be mocked. One hostage played by Kim Director has her breasts ogled by both Frazier and Mitchell but Lee seems to be reveling in the sexism rather than commenting on it and encouraging his audience to enjoy in viewing a woman only as a niece hunk of cleavage. Even Foster is often viewed as a sex object despite the supposedly powerful position she holds and it was disappointing to consider that despite making so many films Lee had not progressed as a filmmaker.\n\nThe performances all felt off as Foster in particular didn't seem to have a real sense of what register to play her character at. She was neither deliciously campy villain nor quietly commanding shadowy figure and although I wanted to hate her as you do a great villain I felt at a strange remove from her. This let a lot of the tension out of the film and I couldn't partake in the glee of seeing her cut down at the end of the film.",

            "content": "An entertaining play on heist tropes.\n\nSpike Lee's crime thriller Inside Man (2006) is a frenzy of fun heist sequences with great planning and clever writing. Inside Man plays with the very idea of what a heist is and how it can be carried out over the course of a film. Lee's direction is solid as he keeps you looking where he wants, so that you never guess the twists and turns of Inside Man. \n\nThe cinematography is good, but not the greatest among Lee's films. The lighting is oddly dark and the shots are just generally ugly looking or dated. The pace slows down towards the middle as there's too much fat spent on long interview sequences with the hostages awkwardly edited into action sequences. I understand why these clips are placed there, but they are not well executed like the heist parts themselves. Spike Lee could have trimmed Inside Man down to have a more focused vision.\n\nDenzel Washington is gripping as he desperately tries to negotiate with the bank robbers to save the lives of numerous hostages. Washington delivers a killer performance of gravitas and wisdom. His character is always catching up even when a step behind. Clive Owen makes for an intimidating bank robber as he brilliantly pulls off an intricate heist like few other crime movies. His strong leadership and undeniable presence makes Inside Man all the more unpredictable in nature as anything can happen with a precise criminal in charge.\n\nI really enjoy Jodie Foster's performance as the tough and resourceful mercenary brought in to help mediate between the bank robbers and the police. She's quick-witted and intelligent as Foster gives a steadfast performance as the manipulative and graceful fixer. I just wish Spike Lee would have used her in more of the film. She's introduced early on, has a few scenes in the middle, then is only there again for the second to last scene. What a waste of a genius actress.\n\nI like Willem Dafoe's police chief, but he only gets a few choice lines and interesting moments. Dafoe should have been given more to do, especially since Chiwetel Ejiofor is fun, but also gets nothing to do. Dafoe and Ejiofor are outshined by Denzel in every scene. Washington is just more magnetic and commanding of a force. Lastly, Spike Lee completely wasted Christopher Plummer, who does a great job seeing as he's given only a few lines, but he could have been a more present figure. He's there to meddle, but he is never overbearing or mysterious truly. The reveal about his character should have prompted a bigger reaction, but everyone is fairly unconcerned or unbothered by such a shocking revelation.\n\nFinally, Terence Blanchard's jazz score is excellent as per usual from Blanchard. I hear echoes of melodies he would later use for BlacKKKlansman with Spike Lee already. Blanchard's jazz has style, class, and energy. I'm glad he composed a fantastic score for Inside Man to up the ante of every scene's suspense.\n\nIn short, Spike Lee did a commendable job directing Inside Man, but it's not his best movie. Malcolm X and Do the Right Thing are far more inspired films compared to the above average thriller Inside Man.",

It's a brilliant thriller and crime drama that takes the usually formula in ways you'd never expect. It's a fascinating battle of wills. And it even brings some moral depth along the way.\n\nTo say that Inside Man has a twisting plot would be a vast understatement. This is the kind of movie where absolutely nothing is as it seems, no-one can be trusted, and everything you think you know is probably wrong. Not only is the bad guy's plan complex beyond belief, but there are so many players with their own, often inscrutable agendas. This movie keeps you- and most of its characters- guessing almost till the end. The whole thing is brilliant and confounding on the level of The Usual Suspects, although with a less ambiguous ending.\n\nAnd what an ending it is. It's the kind of blow you away twist that you'll never see coming, but that will instantly make sense and cast the entire story so far in a new light. And amazingly, the movie doesn't stop there, but takes the time to wrap up every dangling plot thread and provide full closure. Normally this would feel like the film had missed its exit cue, but here it works, and brings the film to an even more satisfying conclusion.\n\nAs Dalton Russel, Clive Owen is a criminal mastermind on the level of Kaiser Soze. When he says he planned the perfect heist, he is not exaggerating one bit. He has every detail planned out, and every possibility covered. At every step of the way he's ahead of the cops. And by the end, when you begin to understand his full motives, you want him to get away with it. Despite having his face covered in most of his scenes, he radiates a keen intelligence, and the calm smugness of someone who knows he has everyone where he wants them. Which makes his occasional bursts of violence even more shocking. I would call him one of Hollywood's best villains in years, except that I'm not sure if he's really a villain.\n\nDenzel Washington is also in full form as Detective Keith Frazier. Intellectually, he may not be on the same level as Russel. But he's smart enough to know when he's being played, and to admit what he doesn't know. Which in this case is far too much for his liking. But even without a full understanding of the situation, or the game his opponent is playing, he (mostly) knows what he's doing, and usually makes the right calls. His battle of wits with Russel is absolutely fascinating; like De Niro and Pacino in Heat, only with higher stakes and less margin for error.\n\nWith his calm, steady, and often surprisingly friendly demeanor, he's quite relatable, and his attempts to figure out just what the hell is going on mirror our own. But he's at his very best in the interview/interrogation scenes. With each of the witnesses and suspects Denzel goes the full range from friendly and sympathetic to intense and accusatory, while dropping in bits of frustration, weariness, and some great jokes too. And in the end, he brings a real smoothness and swagger that I'm sure owe a fair amount to Spike Lee's direction.\n\nJodie Foster is excellent as well in role of high-powered fixer Ms. White. We don't see as much of her as we do Denzel and Owen, but in every scene, she exudes a deep confidence and intelligence, combined with a willingness to do whatever it takes to get the job done. She's effortlessly manipulative and almost charmingly coy even as she's infuriatingly smug and aloof. Yet you can't shake the feeling that she has more of a conscience than she let's on. Although she plays her cards very close to her chest, we know what she's after from the beginning. The fun is figuring out how she's going to get it, and what that means for the other players.\n\nIn addition to the great performances and excellent screenplay, Inside Man is a superbly well directed movie. Spike Lee keeps the pacing tight and the suspense almost unrelenting. There's some very effective use of flashbacks and flash forwards to mix things up and better process what we've seen so far. Every scene is perfectly lit and composed, unless it's supposed to be obscured and grainy. While this isn't exactly an action movie per se, there are some very good action sequences and impressive pyrotechnics towards the end. And because this is a Spike Lee joint, there's a good amount of New York flavor despite the confined setting, and even hints of the city's racial tensions and civil liberties issues.\n\nIf there's any flaw or shortcoming to this movie, I'm at a loss for what it would be. Even the opening and closing credits are brilliant in their own offbeat way. Inside Man is tense, edge of your seat excitement from beginning to end, and far smarter than your average thriller.\n",

This unique crime thriller intersperses police interviews with flashbacks of the bank robbery in question.  At first, the out of context interviews do not make much sense.  As the story progresses, the flashbacks give meaning to the interviews until the end reveals that... all of our assumptions were wrong!  The film alludes to (and even directly shows) how these criminals will pull off this heist, but you will still be completely shocked in the end.  You have to love a story that successfully turns the bank robbers into heroes and the cops into bad guys.  The intentionally convoluted story is supported by big-name actors who all live up to their reputations.  Clive Owen is truly terrifying as the criminal mastermind, Denzel Washington balances his heroic moments and his situational failures, Jodie Foster successfully contrasts Washington's straight-laced character with her shifty, sly role, Christopher Plummer provides the intrigue that makes us wonder what could be in his safe deposit box, and Willem Dafoe does exactly what you'd expect him to do in a gruff cop role.  The film makes for a great rewatch.  It has \"The Sixth Sense\" syndrome, where the twist blows your mind the first time but the film becomes a new experience with each subsequent watch as you catch more clues that you never realized were there.  \"Inside Man\" has some violence and swearing, but it is pretty tame for an R-rated film and worth watching for its complex story and rewarding twist.",

The movie flows, keeps the viewer wondering and yet at the end there was no violence & nobody was killed.

            "content": "#72\nIn Inside Man, his first major screenplay, Russell Gewirtz has approached the classic heist screenplay by employing several novel variations on the genre. In addition to riffing on tropes within the heist genre, he utilizes a brazen theatricality in the modus operandi of the crew pulling off the job. The elegance of this device is not fully revealed to the viewer until the end of the story. Truly, some of the intricately layered trickery by Gewirtz can only be fully appreciated through consequent viewings. The effect of this gives the viewer not only a front row seat to an intricate chess match between the characters of Detective Keith Frazier and our protagonist and mastermind, Dalton Russell; it also allows us just enough information to pique our interest without giving much away in terms of payoff. (Gewirtz)\n\tIn Save the Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need, Blake Snyder dedicates a section of his book to defining not just genre types but also a deeper understanding of stories. At first blush, it may seem that Inside Man fulfills your run-of-the-mill Golden Fleece story. Snyder believes that, \"the theme of every Golden Fleece movie is inner growth\". (Snyder 27) Despite this, we are given a fully formed and completely capable protagonist in Dalton Russell. \n\tFrom the opening image we are face-to-face with Dalton Russell, delivering a very cryptic and collusive speech directly to the camera. In Spike Lee's audio commentary, the director points out the use of his signature double-dolly camera rig to push perspective and focus onto the brick wall while maintaining audience attention on the information being dictated by the static Dalton Russell moving towards the wall. (Lee, Inside Man) In the big, third act reveal scene, we are given a repeat of this opening speech with the same camera move in reverse. The effect of the speechifying Dalton Russell telling us his exact plan gains new significance as we witness him behind the wall during his week of confinement. \n\tI appreciated the Easter eggs that both Gewirtz and Lee sprinkled throughout the film and the screenplay. Gewirtz included multiple references to other films in the heist genre, including Dog Day Afternoon. Not to be outdone, Spike Lee followed that nod by casting two actors from Dog Day Afternoon.  During the pizza delivery/ bugging scene we get a double dose of nostalgia when the character delivering the pizzas is revealed as the same actor who delivered pizzas to Al Pacino in the aforementioned movie. (Lumet) On top of that, we are given a visual nod to one of Spike Lee's most critically acclaimed films as the pizzas delivered are from Sal's, the fictional pizzeria from Do the Right Thing. (Lee, Do the Right Thing - 20th Anniversary Edition)\n\tAside from the phenomenal acting job done by the cast, I feel the combination of talents; Spike Lee, Russell Gewirtz, Brian Grazer and the great casting job done by Kim Coleman served the screenplay very well. Not only was it well executed on the screen, it was also a fascinating read. It revealed just enough in the opening image to whet my interest while the introduction of supporting characters throughout the screenplay was handled very deftly. I've watched the film three times and my appreciation of the depth of character and intelligence given to Clive Owen through the script continue to grow. From page to screen, it's been very rewarding to see Dalton Russell brought to life, in all his mastermind glory.",

So that was the films biggest downfall, it spoiled itself in the first few minutes, and throughout the movie it keeps on doing it so we know at the end that Dalton gets away with the money.  It's a very physiological film, a mind game between a genius bank robber who has literally thought of everything and a detective.  That fact that Dalton takes hostages and knows exactly how to use them to his advantage always has you knowing that their lives are very much on the line.  The film keeps a steady pace, not racing ahead but at the same time not taking it too slowly.  It isn't an action packed crime film, but focuses from begining to end on the successful robbery of a single major bank.  The acting is great, Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors and its no exception here.   Jodi Foster is very good also, as is the likeable badass criminal Clive Owen.  It has a great ending, finally one that doesn't end heroically happily ever after and we saved the day.  It's nice to see and does it in a believable way more or less.  The plot twist about what the robbers were really after was interesting, and didn't turn out to be the bad decision I thought it would be.  So ya it's a great movie, great acting and plot, complicated yet simple, and dosen't need to be full of action and shooting, which happens only once.",

            "content": "Inside Man is a heist film that makes the mistake of trying to be more than a heist film. Clive Owen makes a compelling criminal mastermind, and Denzel Washington is always great as a lead detective. You can easily see these two as formidable adversaries who are desperately trying to outthink one another. I loved how they intercut the interviews with the hostages in the aftermath of the crime with the events of the crime itself. It gave you some insight into how brilliant the crooks' plan was, and at the same time kept you guessing how it all ended. I do enjoy a good surprise ending as well, and I think this one would have been satisfying as well if it hadn't been spoiled for me in advance. Even knowing the twist of how they pulled off the heist, I think the movie could have held up. But, as I was saying, they made a critical mistake by trying to make this more than just a high-quality heist movie.\n\nThey throw in this entire storyline about the owner of the bank, and his desire to resolve the situation without letting his own secrets out. It's a pointless plot that seriously gets in the way of the film. Christopher Plummer is a brilliant actor, but he is so unnecessary to the plot of this movie. Then he hires a specialist played by Jodie Foster in one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen from a quality actress. Every time she comes on the screen the movie just stops in order to meander for awhile before getting back to the movie. Even worse is the fact that she, despite some big talk, proves herself to be absolutely terrible at what she does. Clive Owen is more in control of the situation than she is, and he's the crook! Then, of course, since Spike Lee is directing we have to make a point of throwing in some race relations. Sure it's a bank heist, but that doesn't mean we can't stop everything to watch the white cops jumping to racial stereotypes. If they had stuck with a pure bank heist film I think this could have been remarkable, but because they wasted half the movie I will never recommend Inside Man to anyone. They even diminished the twist ending by drowning it out with all these subplots wrapped up around it. Some focus and direction would have been nice.",

That Malcolm X shot (Denzel looks like he's speeding on a segway with people running behind him) was severely out of place. There is a shot with Clive Owen in the vault and it kind of jump cuts back and that was very awkward. There was some really awkward sound moments (aforementioned scene had loud choir ahhhhh ahhhh ahhhhh! music behind it when nothing was happening), another scene with farty trumpets. \n\nWillem Dafoe was featured too much for having such little of a role. And Denzel's partner is borderline retarded. Understand that the point was to make Denzel seem smarter, but make Denzel seem smarter, not just by comparing him to dimwitted detective. \n\nBut some of the other cinematography was very good. Good use of bird's eye view when Jodie Foster entered the bank. Enjoyed the over exposure when detectives talked to witnesses. Lot of good things going on in this movie.",

By the new millennium, he found it harder to get his brand of films made, but he got a hit when he decided to do this heist film written by Russell Gewirtz (Righteous Kill (2008)). It's a good thriller, but it requires attention. It begins when a group of workers dressed like painters walk into a bank in Manhattan, and take the customers and employees hostage. It's not long before the police get involved, and Detectives Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and Bill Mitchell (Chiwitel Ejiofor) take charge with the negotiations, meanwhile the bank's founder Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer) asks his fixer Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) to ensure the safety of the contents of a safe deposit box in the safe of the bank. The leader of the robbers, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) has a much more bigger plan in mind, which he believes is the perfect robbery. It does feel a bit like Dog Day Afternoon (1975) at first, but there's a lot more to this film, and nothing is what it seems, and the pay-off, although it takes a while to get it, it well worth it. Lee has assembled a good cast, and he even plays around the the look and feel of the film as it unfolds.",

Inside man is nothing new, but it is clever enough to stick apart from the generic stuff. The heist films does not have anything new to say mostly, they are just mostly done for financial benefits. I have liked only two heist films really well, The Rock(1996) and Speed(1994). These films were different in motive and prospect. Apart from them, I have found much interest in John Q(2002)which shows you the humane side of a hijacker and the reason behind his actions without reducing the character to a stereo type.\n\nWhen it comes to Inside Man, the film is mostly benefited by good performances from Clive Owen, Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster. The supporting characters don't really support well. This doesn't have a swift pace or the sort of revelation and outlook on good and bad as the critics say it to be. Just like the similar movies, it has a leading cop kept under the lens for money related events that took place in the past, a leading robber who alone talks much and who barks the orders and a fixer played by foster. Anyway, the way by which the robbers escape, the way they use the hostages for their escape and all are new, also is the concept of Inside Man.",

Pay strict attention to what he says because he chooses his words carefully and he never repeats himself. I've told you his name, that's the \"who\". The \"what\" is a plan to execute the \"perfect bank robbery\". Why? Because he can and the only thing that can stop him is an ambitious hostage negotiator (Denzel Washington).\n\nThe script keeps you interested the whole time, it starts with a great opening scene that captivates your attention and just keeps the movie flowing right until the end. Clive Owen is brilliant as the mysterious bank robber and the pairing of Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Ejiofor as two buddy cops is hilarious (specially in the scene when they're interrogating a witness and can't stop staring at her boobs).\n\nIt has the multiculturalism of new york handled to its advantage, and like \"Rashomon\" it takes us from different points of view letting us choose what side of the story we're on. It has great twists in it and I love that it keeps it simple and never gets out of control.\n\nIts a crowd pleaser (which is strange being directed by Spike Lee) that will have you singing \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\" by the time it ends.",

Action inside the bank is constant on edge. Clive Owen is straight forward, and is convincing at his role. Police-'hostage' interviews were an intriguing idea but were not perfectly executed due to script flaws and imperfect acting. It's nice to see Lee hasn't lost the use of race related situations no matter the screenplay or the seriousness of the matter. The construction worker Kevin is played by talentless, over reaching and bravado oozing Al Palagonia who plays minor roles in most of Lee's films. Although he is a minor character I despise every time he shows up in his movies, especially knowing he gets the screen time for giving personal favors (Apollo Private Jets). Russel Gewirtz's script is picaresque on a scene to scene action basis but lacks any real meaning. The montage of possible outcomes when the police were planning on entering the bank was quite imaginative. The whole premise of the film relies on the final twist which is hardly a twist at all. The very ending is the most clever surprise that was in store and was actually a fortunate way to finalize the film The movie tries to be more then an action film but comes up short.",

When they secure the place, they order all the adult hostages to strip down to their underwear, and put on clothing identical to their own. The strange thing is, they aren't interested in the vault. \r\n\r\nTwo NYPD detectives are assigned to the case, and head to the scene to negotiate with the robbers/hostage takers. One of the detectives, played by Denzel Washington, believes that there is a lot more to the story than the villains are telling the authorities through released hostages. \r\n\r\nThe bank's president (Christopher Plumber) has a secret in the bank that the hostage situation is taking place in, and to keep it secret he hires an independent negotiator (Jodie Foster) to go into the bank and put his secret into her hands to bring it out and away from the NYPD. \r\n\r\nThere are some real strong performances in this movie. Washington is believable in his role as a police detective/hostage negotiator. Foster, who is not in the movie that much actually, also puts forth a strong performance. In fact, the entire cast is good. \r\n\r\nThe script was strong, and interesting, although I think there may have been some plot holes. The flashback and interrogation scenes helped advance the story nicely. \r\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty unique. To me, many of the songs appeared to have African influences. There were no classic tunes everybody knows, and no annoyingly catchy songs that you'll be humming for a week after seeing the movie. \r\n\r\nThere are numerous twists in this film that are spread out just enough so you will notice them.

Not only for the very talented cast but the way it was shot and explained by the main antagonist. I loved the backstory to it as well. I wont give it away but every part of it was really well done all the way through. Terrific performances from Clive Owen, Denzel, and most importantly Christopher Plummer who gives a fantastic performance as always. Shout out to Willem Dafoe as well. I can't give away any details, but it you like generally fantastic movies, this is not one to miss for sure.",

Liked the storyline, there was a few humorous parts e.g. He phones the guys mobile and it plays gold digger! Was expecting more action though and slightly more hostility from the bank robbers who seemed quite subdued. Denzel washington was instantly likeable with his cool police man role, while clive owen(slightly wooden) was just about convincing. Hopefully spike lee is just doing a text book no nonsense movie...not his best but still worth looking at.",

            "content": "A bank robbery in New York has gotten out of control, and it's up to police detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) to act as hostage negotiator and get the bank personal and customers out safely before things turn even worse than they already are. This turns out to be a tough case, since the leader of the bank robbers, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen), turns out to be a very smart individual, who has everything planned to perfection, and who throws up surprise after surprise for Frazier and his men. But while the people around Frazier are slowly getting more and more nervous, he himself does not lose his mind, and begins a high stakes battle of wits with Russell. Things are further complicated, however, when the mayor of New York introduces a mysterious woman to Frazier. This woman (Jodie Foster) wants to protect something that is hidden in one of the safety deposit boxes inside the bank, and she will stop at nothing to force Frazier to let her inside the bank and make sure nothing happens to the contents.\nThis all sounds like an intriguing premise for a thriller, but the movie goes a few steps further than just having an interesting plot. Because while Inside Man does hit all the right notes when it comes to keeping you guessing about what is really going on, it is also very successful in mixing the grittier moments with comedy elements. At times, Inside Man is very funny, but in a way that does not deflate the tension. The dialogue is sharp, with the conversations between Frazier and Russell being especially fascinating, and both actors are at the top of their game in this new movie. Washington's Frazier is an intense but laconic individual, who has a permanent smirk on his face but who reads the bank robbers intentions better than anybody else, while Owen is charismatic and fascinating as the mastermind behind the bank robbery. I was a little disappointed however with Jodie Foster's role. While her part is potentially fascinating, she does not really get the chance to do anything with it other than look cool and act tough. Yes, we all know that she is very good at that, but with a bit more background story, and a bit more screen time, her part could have been even more interesting.\nWith Inside Man, Lee showcases an interesting way of directing thrillers. He ignores the usual build up that you see in thrillers, which consists of an introduction, a chronological development of the main intrigue, followed by a final act in which everything is wrapped up neatly (even flashing forward several times, thus revealing some important developments before they have happened), and this only serves to make Inside Man a movie that is more than your regular suspense movie. I enjoyed this original approach very much, even though he does take quite a long time to wrap things up at the end.",
