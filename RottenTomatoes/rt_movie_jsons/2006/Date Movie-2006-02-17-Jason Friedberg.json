Don't rent this movie at all - it isn't worth the $1 rental price. I really regret ignoring peoples advice that saw the movie \"Dont see this movie! It is awful\" Aaron Seltzer who directed the movie really doesn't know how to make movies. I really wanted to give this 0 stars but instead the lowest possible rating is 1 star. Officialy in my top 10 worst movies I ever seen in my life.

The acting cringe, the directing poor, and the movie's attempts to be humorous resulted in making random crude, lewd, degrading jokes that made no sense whatsoever. I have literally never seen a more repulsing display than this. The characters say and do things that no one in real life would, and the whole time I was asking myself WHY.
