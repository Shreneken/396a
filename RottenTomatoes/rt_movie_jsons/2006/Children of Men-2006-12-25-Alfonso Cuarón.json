            "content": "Children of Men is a remarkable film that stands out for its stunning visuals, immersive storytelling, and powerful performances. Set in a bleak future where humanity faces extinction due to a worldwide infertility crisis, the movie follows Theo (played by Clive Owen), a former activist who becomes embroiled in a dangerous mission to transport a pregnant woman to safety.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Children of Men is its visual style. Director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n creates a world that is both hauntingly familiar and completely foreign, using long takes and immersive camera work to draw the viewer into every scene. The cinematography is simply stunning, and the use of natural lighting and practical effects gives the film a gritty, realistic feel that adds to its overall impact.\n\nAnother strength of Children of Men is its storytelling. The film is both a gripping action movie and a thought-provoking commentary on the state of humanity. The characters are complex and nuanced, and the plot is filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. The film raises questions about immigration, nationalism, and the importance of hope in the face of despair, making it both timely and timeless.\n\nFinally, the performances in Children of Men are top-notch. Clive Owen delivers a powerful portrayal of a man struggling to find his purpose in a world that has lost all hope, while Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, and Chiwetel Ejiofor all turn in excellent supporting performances.\n\nIn short, Children of Men is a must-see film that combines stunning visuals, immersive storytelling, and powerful performances to create a cinematic experience that is both thrilling and thought-provoking. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll and is sure to become a classic of the sci-fi genre.",

Other than that, I loved Alfonso Cuaron's style of directing (and knew he'd do great stuff just like he did in the 3rd Harry Potter movie). I loved the wide shots and the one-shot tracking sequences that he did and he did a good job making the world that was portrayed feel harsh, dark, divided, violent, and gritty as well. I ended up liking how much of the movie unfolded over time and the journey of the two characters that the movie revolved around.",

The editing is almost nonexistent and each moment flows seamlessly because of it. \n\nThe death in the beginning really shook me and I never looked at the movie the same way thereafter. The acting was fairly solid as well, with Clive showing his quality as a fantastic leading man. \n\nThere was one scene in particular that started when Theo (Clive) and Kee are captured at gunpoint by Charlie and Chitwell, and they take Kee and her baby to a building that is getting bombarded by military fire. Theo has to track them down through gunfire, dead bodies, and explosions; it's all one consistent take and it lasts for about 8\u201310 minutes. The action is flawless within the scene (and throughout the whole movie) and so is the CGI. \n\nSpeaking of CGI, the CGI of the baby is fantastic\u2014especially for the time the movie was made. \n\nAll in all, \"Children of Men\" is an awarding and sincere film that is unlike anything I've seen before, and I'll gladly watch it again.",

Although the cinematography is beautiful and the universe is well made, the writing is awful, the acting isn't much better and the editing is pretty bad too because the movie feels like a stitch up of the scenes rather than a coherent whole. I fail to understand why this movie has 92% positive critic review when it is a borderline B movie. It has potential but everything in this movie feels like it tries to pretend to be rather than being. The story pretends to be deep but it is not, the actors pretend they can act but they can not, deaths and violence pretend to move us but most of it don't really make sense. There are so much holes in the plot it is just painful to watch : why is the world burning and why is Britain the last one standing ? how does Theo knows the minister who gives him papers ? why are refugees kept in cages at random places along every road, just standing there while later in the movie we see some of them get executed for no reason ? why does Kee suddenly trust Theo ? why does Jasper kills his wife and gets killed just because the Fishes supposedly found a proof Kee was there ? why does he stay to watch when Jasper sacrifices himself to give them time ? why is it simpler to become refugees instead of just finding a fucking boat, did boats disappeared with the babies and if so how are all these refugees coming to UK ? how does Kee gives birth without any blood ? how did they cut the ombilical cord ? why does the baby doesn't cry before with all the bombs and noises ? why does Syd comes back for Theo and Kee when the uprising starts ? how did he know they were staying at this very place ? I could go on for hours. This movie makes no sense. When one wants to picture a dystopia, the most basic thing is to be coherent in order for the audience to believe it could be true. Apart from an aesthetic point of view, this movie fails at pretty much everything.\nI do not recommand you to watch this movie, you won't miss anything I promise.",

Armed police and soldiers are stationed at train stations and propaganda pieces are constantly being shown on screens in streets and public transport encouraging the public to report potential illegal immigrants in order to \"keep Britain strong\". Asylum seekers and illegal immigrants are hunted down and rounded up and put in cages and ghetto camps before either being deported (if they're lucky), or exterminated.\n\nThe shocking thing is, this incarnation of reality presented to us here is really not too unbelievable. With the rise of overt nationalism in the country and the general public seemingly willing to stumble into an authoritarian state just to deny asylum seekers their basic human rights, this is an entirely possible 2027 (minus the infertility part). Seeing the Union Flags plastered all over the place in the film leaves a sour taste in your mouth, especially following recent developments in the UK.\n\nThis film was robbed of the Best Cinematography Oscar for the absolutely stunning unbroken takes that put you right in the centre of the action.\n\nA lot of my thoughts on this film are much better summed up in this article by Nicholas Barber, so check it out: www.bbc.com/culture/article/20161215-why-children-of-men-has-never-been-as-shocking-as-it-is-now\n\nI think I may have to add this to my top four after this rewatch.",

            "content": "If I could describe Children Of Men I would say this: IT IS A PIECE OF ART. Children Of Men is a movie that starts off strong and finishes strong too. The film really surprised me and didn't expect that I would like it that much. \n\nThe film is very unique with so many things. First, the film has one the best cinematographies that I have ever seen. So many amazing shots that are visually stunning and amazing to look at. And of course, the great long shots that were very unique and well made. They were able to capture the struggle perfectly and they did deliver it exactly like it should be delivered to the audience. Can't talk about that more specifically so I don't spoil anything but all I can say is that the cinematography is fantastic.\n\nChildren of men is based on a book with the same title by P.D. James. Now the screenplay is good but wouldn't call it perfect. There were times when I felt a little bored and the scenes were taking too long or events were talking too long to happen and I felt like they needed to be different. But, overall the film makes you very nervous and on the edge of your seat the whole time and the camera movements really had a big role in that, especially when they were handheld as if we are running or walking with the characters through the chaos that was happing. There was one scene where the camera lens had blood splats on it which was a great detail.\n\nThe production design was unique too and it worked very well with the cinematography so it could capture the full production design from angles that would make it look good. The music played a big role too especially in those emotional scenes.\n\nThe acting was the problem I had. Julianne Moore's performance was very perfect and it might be the only performance in the film that I liked. Clive Owen was okay, in some scenes especially those where he was running or trying to escape, I felt like he was trying so hard sometimes especially in those scenes where he was crying or trying to escape, felt like he was putting on the same facial expressions every time and nothing different. By the end of the film, I noticed myself not having any connections with his character Theo Fren which was because of his acting. Now the supporting cast was good especially Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Although they had small roles in the film they were good.\n\nChildren of Men is a must-see especially for those who like a dystopian story. The film really has so many elements that were used so well. \n\nMy rating is 9/10",

It keeps you on your toes from beginning to end, showing us the limits of what hope can do, especially portrayed in the scene with Clive Owen's character walking among the soldiers during a cease-fire (I don't want to give spoilers, so I won't be more specific, but you know which one I'm talking about).

There are some enjoyable set piece action scenes but the pace can be slow at points. It also tries to land some not too subtle messages on immigration, but most of that is lost in the pure sadism and unpleasantness of many scenes. It's also never really adequately explained where the inexplicable hatred of foreigners comes from or why it features so heavily as a plot device. Overall a decent movie but nothing special.",

I really was impressed at the gritty realism that is offered, the camera work is absolutely amazing!

At least the soundtrack was fine. There were plenty of poorly scripted parts such as the multiple times when confidential information was said in a public place where it was bound to have been overheard and when the main character stopped to watch his friend outside his house rather than continuing to flee. The guy driving the car near the beginning was extremely slow putting the vehicle into reverse and reversing which felt ridiculous considering the situation. Then the Fishes were predictable, just a group of people who kill everyone for no reason. The whole thing just felt uninspired, unrealistic, and rather silly.

Sill, if you like dystopian sci-fi and difficult film-making, it's a must-watch.\n\nClosest comparison: It's like 1984 by way of Birdman.\n\nSetting: Dystopian Sci-Fi\nPlot: On-The-Run\nTone: Bleak Survival",

It looks at how the prospect of the future holds us accountable for our actions but also how it does not.  No cruelty or callousness in this film is anything that does not already exists in our history and even in our present, but presented as it is in a world without hope magnifies it exponentially.  Cuaron's exploration of hopelessness and how it exacerbates everything from apathy and nihilism to racism and elitism and violent conflict is really moving.  Cuaron's film feels vital and urgent, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone looking for something more than a pleasant distraction (though there is nothing wrong with that).",

Overall it was murky about what caused the plague, why humans had descended into savagery in just a few years, and why England was the long survivor.  Characters weren't well developed - were we supposed to root for the unlikable insurrectionists/terrorists?  Where were the scientists in all this?  Didn't anybody have a plan?

            "content": "\"Children of Men\" is the 2006 feature directed by Alfonso Cu\u00e1ron (\"Labyrinth\") and it's written by Cu\u00e1ron, Timothy J. Sexton, David Arata Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. The film is based on the acclaimed 1992 novel of the same name, written by P. D. James. The film is set in the year of 2027, it's been 18 years of human infertility and the world has now collapsed as it faces human extinction. England, one of the few stable countries with functional government left in the world, has now become militarized police state as the government forces round ups and detain immigrants. There, an Englishman named Theo, played by Clive Owen, is recruited by his estranged wife Julian, played by Juliane Moore, to help in the transportation of an important immigrant girl. After a series of events, it's found that this immigrant girl is actually pregnant with earth's first child after those 18 years of human infertility. The cast counts also with the help of Michael Caine as Theo's friend Jasper, Clare-Hope Ashitey as Kee, the pregnant refugee woman and also a brief appearance of Academy Award nominee actor Chiwetel Ejiofor as Luke, one of Julian men.\n\n\"Children of Men\" is a truly remarkable and beautiful film. Based on P. D. James' novel, the movie's plot works do to originality, intelligence in its filmmaking and script as well as its themes, such as religion and hope. As Hollywood progress in its making of sequels and reboots to it's most iconic films, some filmmakers, and studios, once in a while, decide to try and create a solid, original and weel-produced film to a high range of audiences...  and once in awhile, it works. Like another great Scifi film I've seen recently called \"Looper\" (2012), \"Children of Men\" presents a great approach to an untouched idea, that works almost perfectly due to its spot on direction from Cu\u00e1ron, fantastic visuals, and all around great acting. But why ALMOST perfect? well, the films plot is great, but in the end, it can leave you wanting more and it can fell to fast-passed at times, something I deem unnecessary since the film's runtime is not long (109 minutes), maybe a couple more minutes to the film's first act, which felt a bit rushed. But that's pretty much it, everything else is amazing.\n\nClive Owen, wow. I've seen way less of Owen then I should have. The actor is great in this film, managing to turn Theo's sad, drinking, cigarette-smoking persona onto the story's hero. Owen is a pleasant presence in the film, I'll be sure to check out more of the actor's work in my next viewings. Besides Owen's Theo, there's an interesting set of characters, the most notable of these is Kee, played well by actress Clare-Hope Ashitey, who doesn't have many lines in the film, her acting beeing based more on her facial expressions and reactions throughout events. Julianne Moore and Michael Caine both do brief appearances in the film, both are very welcomed, especially Caine, wich appears the most between the two. He plays Theo's weed-smoking friend, Jasper, a change for Caine, who usually does not play such characters.\n\nThe film's directing is perfect. With fantastically orchestrated single-shot sequences, those who last to up until six minutes, these six minutes referring to the Bexhill escape scene, where Clive Owen's character, Theo, is followed by the camera as he tries to rescue Kee and leave the facility, all while a war between British forces and refugees takes place. The scene is fantastic, action packed and certainly the best moment in the whole film. It's completed with top special effects, amazing camera movements that capture both Theo, the war and the film's scenery and background, accompanied by a great mix of sounds and music that replace the film's score for the scene. The scene is not the only single-shot sequence in the film, another amazing one is the four minutes roadside ambush scene, which was deemed impossible to shoot by some. Ignoring the \"Impossible\" factor, Cu\u00e1ron managed to shoot the scene greatly, with no apparent CGI involved in the making. The film's cinematography is too worth mentioning. It all looks astonishing, with great shots showing beautiful scenery , especially in the film's final scene in the boat, these are accompanied by the fine use of light and editing to better capture the shot.\n\n\"Children of Men\" is a fantastic accomplishment from director Alfonso Cu\u00e1ron, it's a shame the movie did not get the attention it deserved in its box office, it is really a must-see if you are a movie geek. The visuals and camera usage well leave you astonished, and although the films pace and plot may look slow or kinda of boring for some, for those who can actually see the films beauty and originality, the film will be a fine piece. 4/5.",

I have grown tired of Moore's endless Oscar bait appearances in recent years and was having a tough time connecting her to this film in a positive way. Nevertheless, I sat down and watched and boy was I stunned. Children of Men has a few flaws, namely some awkward opera bumps in the score where an abstract instrumental approach would have been better along with some really interesting exposition type questions that remain unanswered (likely for the better but I am a curious filmgoer, especially when it comes to science-fiction/post-apocalyptic stuff). Other than that however, Children of Men is a surprising, multi-faceted, well cast and extremely thoughtful thriller that is very likely the current pinnacle of Cuaron's career (Gravity doesn't even register on the radar). Despite the fact that he always gives the same performance, I have always appreciated Clive Owen for his consistently excellent composure and he doesn't disappoint here. Moore is used sparingly, which works perfectly for the film. The supporting cast is strong as well but the emotion of Owen drives this movie to the finish, although nothing could have been accomplished without the fantastic adapted screenplay and incredible world-building. In addition to a scathing and timely critique of America's arcane immigration systems and conservative party policies, the film is clearly targeting some broader human concepts as well, addressing ideas such as human rights and the importance of hope in emotional stability. On the way to this goal, the movie manages to surprise again with one of the most impressive urban warfare scenes of the 21st century along with particularly detailed post-apocalyptic Briton landscaping that really took the cake. The result is a well done film that hits in all the right places and surprises in a number of others. Well worth repeated watches.",

            "content": "What if in a mere eleven years, mankind was on the edge of dying out, with no hope in sight? This is the world Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n explores in Children of Men. Starring Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine, the film portrays Britain in a dystopian future during the year 2027. Women have been infertile for nearly twenty years, and nobody knows why. Theo (Clive Own) is thrust into action by his ex wife Julian (Julianne Moore), who needs his help in aiding a young African woman named Kee. A mashup of Sci-Fi, action, and drama, Children of Men asks it audience to never surrender hope, no matter what the obstacles are. \n\tInterestingly, Cuar\u00f3n delays in developing the idea of holding onto hope, not even showing a glimpse of anything redeeming in nearly the first forty minutes. Britain is the last country with a somewhat stable government, but it's beginning to lose control. Its citizens live aimlessly, knowing their generation will be the last of humanity. Theo is one of these citizens, and like the rest of society, he's given up on life. \n\tThe films opening shot features Theo walking into a coffee shop one morning. No one is in line, however, as everyone is watching the TV announce that the youngest person in the world, Diego, had just died. While everyone is shocked, with some even crying, Theo seems completely indifferent. He quickly navigates through the crowd, taking advantage of the distracted customers. Right away, the audience gets a glimpse into how little hope Theo has. The youngest person in the world dying has no impact on him, even though other people are clearly in mourning. At one point, he even seems annoyed by coworkers grieving, and ends up using Diego's death as a means to get out of work for the day. Later on, Theo tells his friend Jasper (Michael Caine) that most days he feels like \"shit\" and has lost all feelings, even giving a small hint at the consideration of suicide. At the beginning of the scene, you also hear a portion of Ruby Tuesday by Franco Battiato. Besides \"Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday\", the lyrics \"Dying all the time. Lose your dreams and you, will lose your mind. Ain't life unkind\" are also heard; a small subtle nod by Cuar\u00f3n to humanities impending extinction. Not even a minute later, the audience is introduced to a horrifying machine. Called Quietus, once it's consumed the user quickly passes out, and then proceeds to die in their sleep. The fact that the government provides suicide kits for their citizens goes to show just how grim the situation is. With the next few scenes, though, a small glimmer of hope resurfaces.\n\tA little while after the scene with Jasper, Theo finds himself in his cousins house. When entering, he walks down a hall with the statue David at the end of it. One of Cuar\u00f3ns possible reasons for including this here has to do with the creation of David. The statue was created during the renaissance, and one of its recurring themes centered on people doing the most with their lives and overcoming any tests. This is a bit of foreshadowing on Cuar\u00f3n's part, giving a hint of what kind of journey Theo is about to embark on. Theo spends some of the next scenes with Julian, and in the process meets Kee. He also hints to Julian how money may not have been the only reason for helping her, and he's curious about whether or not they'll have a future together, once the job is done. They exchange in some playful banner, and even play an old game for Kee, showing there is still clearly affection between the two of them. Unfortunately for Theo, any hope he has in reconciling with Julian quickly evaporates in the next couple scenes. \nWithin a few seconds, the group is suddenly ambushed by a massive mob. In the ensuing pandemonium, Theo, Kee, Kee's caretaker (Miriam) and Julian's friend Luke are able to drive away. Julian, though, is shot and dies a few moments later. This absolutely devastates Theo. Confused and upset, he breaks down sobbing a short while later. This is where Theo hits rock bottom; any hope he had left in the world died with Julian. Once the group arrives at their safe house, Theo is eager to depart. Unbeknownst to him, Julian's death is one of three major twists that occur over the next couple scenes. One of which fundamentally changes Theo.\nThe next twist in the story has the most profound impact on Theo. Kee speaks to Theo alone, and reveals that she is pregnant. Dumbstruck, Theo is left in awe as he finally realizes what is at stake. It is also briefly inferred before this scene that most animals seem to like Theo, even hostile ones. This shows Cuar\u00f3n's intentions of Theo playing a shepherd like role, meant to guide and help Kee. Further adding to this is the fact that Kee revels her pregnancy to Theo in a stable surrounded by animals, which is similar to the birth of Jesus. Jesus's birth was viewed by many as a miracle, and a sign of a new age. This gives the impression that Kee's child could have the same impact that Jesus did on the world. This is also where Cuar\u00f3n first introduces the idea of never losing faith. Even when humans are faced with insurmountable odds, they can still find a way to defy them. \nTheo's renewed sense of hope is yet again dealt another blow, when he learns that Luke and the rest of Julian's organization coordinated her death. His newfound faith gives him the drive to help Kee and Miriam escape. The trio finds refuge at Jaspers house, who's overcome with joy at the sight of a pregnant woman, showing how much hope Kee's pregnancy inspires in people. Luke is able to track down the group though, and Jasper distracts him while the trio sneaks away. Theo's faith is again tested as he watches Luke gun down Jasper. However, it was Jasper's newfound belief in hope that aided him in keeping the trio's location secret from Luke. \nA few scenes later though, Kee begins to go into labor, and Miriam gives herself up to a soldier in the hope of protecting Kee. Following that, Theo and Kee are able to rent a hotel room, where Kee proceeds to give birth to a baby girl. However, Luke quickly resurfaces and is able to steal Kee and the child from Theo. He pursues them to a nearby building where a firefight is ensuing between rebels and the British government.\nOver the next six minutes, the camera follows Theo's breathtaking entrance and subsequent search for Kee into the building in a single shot. Cuar\u00f3n wanted the audience to feel a sense of realism, like they are there with Theo. The use of shooting in a single take also helps ramp up the suspense and intensity of the scene. Theo successfully finds Kee and the baby, and they begin to exit the building, narrowly avoiding a tank blast that results Lukes death. \nTheir departure from the building is where Cuar\u00f3n decides to bring to center the theme of never losing hope. As Theo and Kee slowly walk through the building, its' inhabitants are overcome with shock and joy at the sight of a child. Many of them begin to weep, and are left speechless by the miracle. Others begin to sing, reaching their hands out to touch what represents humanities new future. Rebel soldiers immediately stop firing upon sight of the child, and they whisper small blessings while passing by. British soldiers order an immediate cease-fire, and begin bowing and kneeling to the child and her mother. This brings back the reference to Jesus, as people are inspired and ecstatic about the sight of the child, ass they see hope. For just a few minutes, all the chaos in the scene stops. Everyone is fixated on the baby, and how the once bleak future, is not so bleak anymore. Cuar\u00f3n brings the audience rushing back to reality though, as an RPG blast punctuates the peacefulness. For a few brief minutes, the audience is able to witness the potential miracles the baby can have for the human race. Even though just for a short time, the fact that everyone stopped fighting in respect of the child shows how humanity still has hope as a species. \nTheo, Kee, and the child safely make it to nearby boat, which they then use to await the arrival of an even bigger cargo ship, which will provide protection and care for the group. While awaiting the arrival of the cargo ship, Theo revels he's been shot, and passes unconscious a few moments later. For just a few moments, with Theo incapacitated, the cargo ship nowhere in sight, and Kee being all alone, that lingering sense of hopelessness creeps back into the audiences mind. Cuar\u00f3n is testing the audience, to see whether or not they will lose hope again. Fortunately, the ship emerges from the mists. \nOne of the final shots of the film shows the ships name, Tomorrow. I think this is an obvious node by Cuar\u00f3n to look forward to the next day, to have hope. The final words of dialogue, spoken by Kee to her child, \"we're safe now, we're safe\" finally allows the audience to rest. They can have faith knowing that Kee will be safe. \nHumanity is facing a somber future, Women are infertile, and have been for almost twenty years. Britain is one of the last stable governments, although it's beginning to show signs of collapse. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n delves into this country and its citizens, many of who are on the brink of an uprising. Cuar\u00f3n makes use of many different characters, certain shots, bits of dialogue and alive background to help explore his ideals about never relinquishing hope, no matter how dire the situation is.",

I think part of it is the extreme amount of depression in the movie. At a certain point I think the somber tone started to rub off on me. I realize in this particular post-apocalyptic world, since there is no hope of a future, depression and apathy are the appropriate emotions. But Children of Men is so bleak in its story, cinematography, and score that even the glimmer of hope they offer in the film isn't enough to pique my interest. The shaky camera is a big pet peeve of mine as well, even though it probably is the right choice to capture the gritty feeling of this world. Finally, I struggled at times to keep track of all the enemies and their different agendas. Clive Owen was perfect for the lead role, and I liked that they included a very powerful moment that gave him a logical reason for suddenly starting to care. In fact all the acting was great. The biggest standouts for me, aside from Clive Owen, were Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor. They are always spectacular, and in their limited roles here they made a big impact. I also have to give Children of Men credit because it does an amazing job of creating this world without spending hours on exposition explaining how they got there. Yet, despite the excellent world-building and casting, the overall package is one that doesn't do much for me. To be fair, though, it seems I am in the minority.",

            "content": "Predating Alfonso Cuaron's Academy Award win for Gravity with more Oscar-nominated material, Children of Men sounded like a promising step towards his contemporary award winning talents.\n\nWithout hesitation, Children of Men immediately sets its narrative up to be paced very well. Audiences are immediately given an established context for the universe of the narrative and the timeframe, though they are left to wonder precisely how the world has become entirely infertile. The ambiguity of this plot point may frustrate some viewers, but its not the main focus of the story. The narrative is one which is always about moving forward instead of trying to explain the past, and it gets viewers so embalmed in the atmosphere that they are likely to get lost in the film within a short matter of time. This is where the narrative starts to develop, and brilliance becomes clear.\nThough there is a large universe in Children of Men, it is contrasted by a focus on a small group of characters. It follows them constantly, keeping its focus clear as it always moves forward and gets into exploring its themes. The narrative seems very much to be a religious allegory as its story depicts how the birth of a child can bring peace to the world, yet it does so in a way not accomplished before. The story of Jesus has been told countless times and has been used as an allegory for stories such as Cool Hand Luke (1967) and Superman (1978), yet Children of Men is more about bringing a prodigy to life than his individual change on the world around him. Children of Men turns this concept into a post-apocalyptic thriller and does it with an intelligent screenplay and powerful characters, as well as bringing in contemporary subject matter such as treatment of asylum seekers so that it can keep relevant to modern audiences. Underneath everything the story itself is a little bit thin, but it consistently keeps moving forward so that the characters remain engaging and so that new imagery can keep viewers lost in the universe of the feature.\nThe most memorable asset of Children of Men is its groundbreaking cinematography. Children of Men makes use of the same distinctive style of long-shots that won an Academy Award in Gravity, serving as a reminder of the keen eye for imagery that Alfonso Cuaron holds as a filmmaker. Long-shots are a technique that require quite a lot of mastery and are infrequent in contemporary mainstream films due to the fact that it is easier to disguise production challenges beneath editing, but the fact that Children of Men is so full of them just goes to show that Alfonso Cuaron's style as a director is not one which comes with problems. The production clearly would have required a lot of work, but the cinematography is some of the greatest to grace any film within the 2000's. The long-shots enforces a sense of realism in the film because it consistently tracks protagonist Theo Faron around and gives viewers a sense that they are actively witnessing everything unfold directly in front of their eyes without conventional Hollywood editing. And as well as that, the cast are challenged to deliver the best they can over extensive periods in single shots without being saved by the editing, ensuring that they give their ultimate efforts for viewers. The camera is also constantly shaking, reinforcing a sense of realism without plaguing the feature with a lack of visual coherence. And what the cinematography actually captures is a very gritty dystopia, a vision of the future so similar to actual modern day that the realism is striking yet also so violent and nihilistic that it sets up a truly intense atmosphere for the narrative. The production design is brilliant with monochromatic colour and strong lighting to benefit the practical sets, and the tracking shots ensure that viewers are given a wide perspective of everything which truly works to ensure that the universe feels real and therefore strikes viewers with greater feeling. The universe in the film is built even greater through the use of strong sound effects and editing to ensure they enter the auditory field at the correct moments, further reinforcing a sense of involvement in the narrative. In short, Children of Men is one of the greatest films in recent years to build a dystopian world and capture it with a magnificent eye for imagery, so looking back on the film it was just a matter of time before Alfonso Cuaron would walk away with an Academy Award.\nAnd to keep a human side to it all, Children of Men does not neglect the importance of a talented cast.\nClive Owen is the lead in Children of Men, and he delivers one of his greatest performances to date. Clive Owen captures an everyman nature to him which fits the context of the universe very well, but that value is intrinsic to him. What he actually has to prove to to audiences is that he can work under the innovative style of Alfonso Cuaron's directional manner. With every long shot, every climactic moment in the film and every extensive period of gentle conversation, Clive Owen never loses sight of just how to perfect the character of Theo Faron. He is so consistent with keeping this energy up that when it combines with the many long-shots of the film there is a genuine feeling that he has delivered his entire performance in a single take, a single shot. He is emotionally intense yet gentle in approaching the other characters, combining both the ambition to survive the dystopian universe of the film with a realistic human spirit. Clive Owen ties himself into the atmosphere so well that he never sinks out of it, and his performance is a massive step up for his own credibility as a leading man in strong dramatic material.\nAs predicted, Julianne Moore is a powerful cast member. With the exception of The Seventh Son (2015), Julianne Moore is an actress who never lets audiences down and is able to maintain that legacy in Children of Men by bringing along her natural charms and gentle spirit while maintaining an underlying spirit for commanding those around her. There are unprecedented twists that come with Julianne Moore's presence in Children of Men, and she uses them to her advantage without ever losing sight of her characters intentions. Julianne Moore delivers just as well as you might hope in Children of Men, sharing a powerful chemistry with Clive Owen and standing on her own two feet just as well.\nMichael Caine abandons his traditional look of sophistication to model himself more after a long-haired Donald Sutherland in Children of Men, yet he maintains his distinctive charm while adding a refreshing new attitude to the character. His presence is welcome as always and his character is unconventional which adds a light sense of humour to the film. It is light enough not to detract from the dramatic nature of the film yet funny enough to give audiences a moment to catch their breath, and he works with the more dramatic moments of the film with beautiful emotional passion. Michael Caine's small role in Children of Men accrues some truly brilliant moments.\nClare-Hope Ashitey does a beautiful job conveying the innocence of a child and the vulnerability of a pregnant woman with a strong desire to survive, and Chiwetel Ejiofor's unpredictable level of intensity is exceptional.\n\nSo though its story has a simple path, Children of Men is packed with so many brilliant elements that it is near impossible to notice: the cast are brilliant, the screenplay is thoroughly intelligent, the atmosphere is powerfully intense and the visual style of the film combines all kinds of brilliance into being captured by some of the finest cinematography cinema has to offer.",

If you're an up and coming director and you want to learn how to build up action scenes, chase scenes, shoot outs, and more, this is the film to study. The way they direct action scenes and bring out the grittiness in each one really says a lot. I'm normally not a fan of chase scenes, as they have mostly become fairly generic, but here, these were some of my favorite chase scenes. They were intense, real, heart pounding, and they worked really well. This movie deserves an A for it's violence and brutality. \n\nFor a movie made a decade ago, it still looks really good. Most \"futuristic\" movies are often flooded with CGI and dated graphics, but this movie builds this dark and practical world, and it's ugly. This movie looked really good and it sets the tone early on.\n\nThis movie was well written and had a really intriguing premise. The overall story and premise had me hooked throughout and I was always excited to see where the story would take me next. It's a smart and in depth human drama that really emphasizes on this collapsing society.

Nearly every character is used in this way, their presence in the film is the equivalent of a street sign; to direct our jaded protagonist and the pregnant-unexplained-soft heart inducing-savior- central plot device through one scene and into the next, before ultimately dying and death I can yield no sympathy for.\n\nThough not indefensible and not necessarily essential, I found the lack of explanation incredibly annoying.

While I used to be a devout Hindu once, I don't think I would ever turn to a God anytime in the future (but of course, anything is possible). But that doesn't stop me from thinking about any future eventualities that may lead me back to a religious faith.\n\nAnd then a couple of days back, an interesting scenario presented itself. What if, sometime in the future, we would have to live in a world without children? What if, faced with infertility, we were slowly moving towards our own extinction? At a time like that, when hope recedes and there is no humanity left, is it humanly possible not to take solace under a supreme being? Interesting questions, huh, but scary ones too!\n\nWe all know Alphonso Cuaron as the director of the critically acclaimed space epic Gravity. But the Mexican director has had a distinguished career before that one, with some wonderful movies. Children Of Men, a 2006 futuristic sci-fi thriller is one of them. Starring an ensemble cast including Clive Owen, Julianne More, Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The film is set in 2027, where epidemics and social anarchy has left much of the world without political order. Britain is the only surviving nation-state, whose authoritarian government has maintained a tight leash, with immigrants and refugees being treated as animals.\n\nTheo Faron is a disillusioned political activist turned government bureaucrat, whose young son Dylan was killed in an epidemic 20 years ago. His ex-lover is the leader of a rebel group, demanding equal rights and dignity for the refugees. Theo gets drawn into their cause, when she asks him for a favor from his influential cousin, to get transit papers to smuggle a girl out of Britain. And of course, there's another little problem - an unexplained genetic disorder has left the world's women infertile, with the world without a newborn baby for the past 18 years!\n\nThe premise is exciting, a unique idea, and can be great action flick. But you see, Alphonso Cuaron isn't your usual filmmaker, he aim is to accomplish something more. He shows us where we  are \"moving on\"  as a civilization! His vision is scary; Is this how our world is going to turn into? A world where science has ruled its roost and civilization is coming to a full circle, where faith and religion are ones keeping people alive, in the midst of the the chaos around them? Unlike other sci-fi, where the look of a futuristic world is overdone, Children Of Men gives us a London that is believable. A London where you see roadside make-shift shops and electric rickshaws. I couldn't help having the notion that the place like this really exists, a disintegrating picture of a once prosperous city. That, is not only it, Cuaron has left no unturned in giving this movie a touch of realism. The hero is like one of us, he has his flaws, and doesn't attempt at heroics. He doesn't run around like some superhuman like Tom Cruise (in Minority Report).  He is a normal person, a cynic disgruntled with the world, whose last remaining tinge of humanity raises him to do extraordinary things, albeit like an ordinary man.When someone shoots, he takes cover and waits it out. When his loved ones die, his is distraught, but there are no emotional outbursts. This is an action flick alright, but unlike anything anything I have ever seen before.\n\nWith Cuaron, you don't expect a poorly made film. With single-shot, realistic action sequences and unhinged realism and authenticity in its execution, he set a new benchmark for action films (unfortunately, not many took the cue). The cinematography is excellent; in one of the action sequences, the camera just follows the characters, and the audience is put right in the mix. Blood splatters on the lens, there is dust, and it all  feels so real. Cuaron has deftly ignored the past, the reason behind the turmoil and the infertility, his focus being on the present. A world without children is impossible to perceive. Their little cries, the soft laughter and the aura of life around a child; a world devoid of these is the worst nightmare one could have. And when we see that pain and suffering on screen, we can understand. We empathize with their plight and internalize that pain. It gets personal, and taps into our deepest of emotions\n\nWith a great idea, a great script and some solid performances, you can't go wrong, especially with Alphonso Cuaron at the helm. Having loved both Gravity and Y Tu Mama Tambien ( his debut, a Mexican road-drama), I never expected a bad film. But the emotional depth and the hard, jolting realism in Children Of Men blew me away. It is definitely a great achievement, a benchmark in in action films, with a story that is both emotional and scary.\n\nDon't miss this one. Watch it ASAP!",

Ejiofor was brilliant, and Clare-Hope Ashitey I thought was awesome. Charlie Hunnam's character though I did not like. Felt like that was just a throw in character. It's a great film no doubt, just isn't one of my personal favorites.",

It's a great encapsulation of all the best elements of dark, future-gazing science fiction, hauntingly recognizable despite the distant timeframe. Owen is fantastic in a demanding leading role: part jaded worker-bee, part helpless victim, shattered widower, problem solver and action hero. The film moves incredibly quickly, delighting in its chances to shatter the illusion of tranquility with a jolting change of tone and fortune. One long, jaw-dropping shot in particular has stuck with me for years, even as details of the rest of the plot faded. If you've seen the film even once, you know exactly what I'm talking about. And despite that breakneck tempo, it still somehow manages to work in a wealth of world-building details and delicate character moments. The action scenes are intense and vivid, the moral quandaries deeply disturbing, and its tenor is right on the mark. Epic, powerful sci-fi that teases a post-9/11 distrust of the government without overdoing it.",

Because of this, the action places you right in the thick of it and doesn't cool down until things have settled.  Another reason why the action sequences are liable to leave you sweating and your heart racing is the primary character, Theo Faron, played by Clive Owen.  Owen's performance is one of the most realistic and subtle performances I have seen in a long time.  Theo Faron is a true every man that just happens to get mixed up in a conflict that will decide the fate of the human race.  He doesn't set out to be a hero.  He doesn't ask for any responsibility.  It is thrust upon him and he makes the very human choice to carry it.  Because of this, you quickly come to really care for him.  He has no combat training, thus making every action sequence a true sprint for survival.  He isn't the only one to turn in a great performance, though.  The entire cast does a solid job of immersing you in a world where humanity has gone sterile.  All in all, Children of Men is one of the greatest films of all time and one of the most human.",

            "content": "Keep Rolling\n\nIf one scene in Children of Men, more accurately, one shot, isn't being played over a hundred times, dissected, analyzed, sped up, slowed down, played in reverse, and thoroughly deconstucted in film schools right now, there's something fundamentally wrong with film schools. \n\nThis uninterrupted take running over 4 minutes is shot in a car with runaway rebels: the driver and Julianne Moore in the front, and Clive Owen, the pregnant woman and another character cramped in the back. The shot begins with Moore and Owen playing games as they motor merrily along a hillside country road to their designation and, after fleeing from a gang of murderous counter-rebels, ends with two cops being shot to death and left on the road. \n\nI'm not sure many movie audiences consciously appreciate the skill and mastery of a long uninterrupted take. There are no edits. There is no room for error. There is no stopping and starting and shooting from various angles, then filtering out unwanted material and tweaking the content, flow and pace in the editing room. It's one, long uninterrupted take. It is an actual unadulterated document of the action. I suppose this effects a kind of documentary realism, which explains why steadycams have been replaced with shakycams. I notice them all the time. When a film has too many cuts in it, I figure there wasn't much patience and confidence shared on the film set. The editor may be trying to save the film. With cutty films there is less risk and challenge because you can shoot the same scene so many times in so many ways and splice them to splinters. Save it in post. The editor is the filmmaker.\n\nThe long shot in Children of Men is a work of sheer genius. A single continuous take from inside a car driving down a country road starts off with Moore and Owen playing a game: blowing and catching a ping-pong ball in each other's mouths. This game sets up and illustrates how risky and challenging the rest of the shot will be, bordering on plain recklessness. The playfulness will be contrasted by the ensuing terror. If the ball bounced off their teeth it would have been easy enough to cut and restart until they got it right, since it was only a minute into the shot. Neat trick but now comes the crazy magic. Cue the flames as a burning truck rolls down the hill to cut them off. The driver slams to a halt and reverses as an army of screaming militants emerge from the woods, throwing rocks, beating sticks, and smashing through Moore's window. Moore throws up her hands to protect herself from flying shards of glass. A Molotov cocktail smashes and flames up on the hood. The shot continues while they drive in reverse. A motorcycle breaks out from the swarm, buzzing towards them, firing a gun shot which breaks through the windshield causing Moores's blood to splatter. We see she's been shot in the throat. Owen covers her to stop the bleeding. As the motorcycle speeds closer, Owen throws open his door to precisely knock one rider off the back of the bike, hurling to the ground. The motorbike crashes against the car and we see the bike and the other rider spin in the air and hit and bounce off the ground. The shot continues as the windshield cracks open and the car turns around to drive forward. Moore's bleeding can't be contained and she dies. They are pursued by the two policemen who pull them over at gun point. The driver steps out and shoots both cops dead. Owen scrambles out of the car (with the cameraman) to scold the killer. They drive off into the distance leaving behind two dead cops (and the cameraman). \n\nWOW! All this in one take. Four fabulous minutes. It's kind of choppy and the timing misfires here and there, but it's still an incredible and incredibly exciting work of filmmaking. I haven't researched how this amazing shot was pulled off because I don't care to deconstruct the beauty and mystery out of it. The POV is always in the car with five people (six, including the cameraman). Not a big car yet the camera manages to move and circle around freely within a confined interior. Even if this was shot with the finest, smallest digital video camera available at the time, it still needed an operator. A really skinny small kid perhaps? This long take stands out in the movie. In its entirety, the movie is worth watching, and for this shot alone deserves a perfect score. I challenge you to watch it only once. \n\nThere is another uninterrupted shot of note in the film. Owen and the pregnant woman enter a dingy old room, Owen pays off the provider and proceeds to wash his hands as the woman lays back on a beat up mattress, and then as Owen coaches the woman, he sterilizes his hands and handles the baby when it emerges from the womb, then rests it on the mother's belly, umbilical cord and all. One take, 3 1/2 minutes. This time there would be no second tries. There are no tricks here. The fiction is blurred. Clive Owen is the midwife who delivers the newborn. \n\n(Though a wandering close-up betrays the baby might have been planted off-camera.)",

Other shots I found interesting were zoom shots that showed the action outside the car and then showed the people inside.  There was an example of off-screen space when the girl was in the playground and we could see her through the glass.  There were a ton of handheld shots especially during the action scenes.  I must say though that even though I thought the camerawork was expertly done, at times it became a bit tedious for the viewer.  The camera would often shake and the different 360 views sometimes made me a little dizzy.  (Still not nearly as bad as Cloverfield)  The film as a whole was amazing though.",

The last battle is something is didn't expect at all to be as well done as it was, the gunshots, blood, sound effects, explosions, it was done in equal to many of the great war movies.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nAlfonso Cuaron is beginning to become one of my favourite directors with three films so far that has showcased his masterful talents; Gravity, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Children of Men. So far, I believe that Children of Men is his most ambitious film in regards to its themes and messages, a world slowly destroying itself because of human nature has lost the ability to reproduce. A premise that is so original and intelligent that I wonder why it has taken so long to be adapted, the novel was published in 1992.\n\nThe plot of the film is quite easy to follow but it is not the basic story that draws us in, it is the world that the writers and Cuaron has created. This is a world that initially feels familiar and the further the film travels, the more we see this beautiful landscape destroyed and layered with scum and debris. What makes it so frightening is the cause behind all this war and destruction, the idea that we cannot reproduce, tearing away our prospects of a thriving and fulfilled future; a natural occurrence that cannot be manipulated back to its original function has led to an uprising of anger and sadness. Through this, people act out, in this film it seems to be mostly men causing physical destruction to its environment, and Cuaron ensures that we see the warfare as something brutal but also pointless; he understands the stupidity behind their intentions, given the fact that anything they would be fighting for would not be substantial once our species is extinguished, but when a miracle falls in their lap, some will use it to push further their cause; demonstrating the flawed mindset of humanity. It was when the appearance of the baby upon the fighting men, that violence and death stopped, and even though it was only for a second, it brought hope to their eyes and ensuring them that humanity's future is not ultimately doomed; a wonderfully crafted scene by Cuaron and his crew.\n\nChildren of Men's strongest aspect is its cinematography, handled by Emmanuel Lubezki, who has also worked with notable directors like Terrence Malick and Tim Burton. Lubezki has this human quality to his filmmaking, and this is prominent during his works with Malick, creating something graceful and spiritual but also managing to keep itself grounded to our level. Multiple shots in Children of Men are composed of long takes and hand-held handling in order to keep the audience engaged and immersed to the world that they have created; frequent cutting and stationary photography could take the audience away from the screen and that is not what Cuaron wants. He wants us to feel what the characters feel; he wants us to gain a perspective that is personal and authentic in order to give us an experience that is unforgettable. There were multiple moments where my body was tense as the camera rarely gives us time to take it in, instinct takes over and we enter a mode of fight or flight. Lubezki and Cuaron is a match made in heaven, and it would be a travesty if they do not collaborate again after Gravity, which was a film that gripped me until the very last frame. It is a damn shame that he did not receive the Academy Award for Best Cinematography.\n\nThe performances in this film were grounded and intimate, featuring very little moments for an actor to emphasise the drama within their characters. Clive Owen as the film's protagonist, Theo Faron, carries the film impressively, as the camera rarely ever gives the actor a moment's break; it is constantly following and shooting him, forcing him to remain intact with his character. As a physical actor he shines as well, with the climax of the film displaying just how far he could go, reacting to the unpredictability that surrounds him. It is a performance that may define his career, and I doubt anything he would ever do later on would push him as much as Cuaron did for this film.\n\nChildren of Men will no doubt be an important film in the years to come, especially since Cuaron has become hot property after the sensational ride that was Gravity. I expect to find further appreciation for this film, the more I explore the director's filmography. A Children of Men is an unforgettable and intelligent film.",

After Gravity, I was more than willing to see what else Cuar\u00f3n had on his resume. And Children of Men, while not at all like Gravity, is a mind-blowingly put together Sci-Fi drama!\n\nThe story is clever and fresh. But it's the filmmaking that is the star of the show! Firstly, the movie is set in 2027, and it feels like a real place. The futuristic elements are really kept in check. The world looks just like it is now, except it sucks. It's a horrible place. And the production design by Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland expertly reflects that. The cinematography by the peerless Emmanuel Lubezki is absolutely outstanding! The costume design, the set decoration, and the lighting all merge together to create a perfectly tangible world.\n\nAnd then there are the long takes. The best scenes in the movie are these 4-5 minute single takes. They are show stopping, jaw dropping experiences that cannot be described! There's a car chase that is probably the most well known long shot in the movie. But it's a 6 minute take of Clive Owen rushing through a war zone that leaves the biggest impression. The staging involved with these shots is mind-numbing. I couldn't believe my eyes!\n\nThe acting is also spot on. Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Clare-Hope Ashitey give top-notch efforts. It's not just acting, it's hitting marks and keeping energy going. There's a 3 minute child birth scene, and the level of commitment that Owen and Ashitey maintain is stunning!\n\nYou don't just watch Children of Men, you're placed right in the middle of the action. You don't simply see this movie, you feel it too. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n is, when it comes to shooting style, the most inventive director I have ever experienced. More like this, please.\n\n\"As the sound of the playgrounds faded, the despair set in. Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voices.\" 9/10",

In Cuaron's world, set in 2027, human-kind has descended into chaos because infertility has plagued the world.  The world's youngest human-beings are 18 so humans scramble to survive knowing that some day soon that humans will be extinct.  Clive Owen plays disenchanted bureaucrat Theo, who one day is thrown into an important mission by his estranged American wife Julian (Julianne Moore), who is the leader of a movement which seeks to challenge the established police state.  Theo is tasked to bring Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), a pregnant girl, to a place where people specialize in curing infertility.  This baby will provide hope for the continuation of man-kind's existence so it represents something significant to a lot of people.  'Children of Men' is astounding in scale and what Cuaron does so well is to immerse you in this future dystopian world.  It's a world set in the future that is believable and does not feature typical sci-fi elements.  Even the characters are fully engaged in what's going on.  Scenes of refugees trying to find a new life in the United Kingdom (the last stable country in the world), a stunning ambush on the main characters, and the reaction of people when they first see Kee's baby are all things that make this film come together to perfection.  Cuaron gives us all-too-real suspense, a disturbingly gritty world, and ultimately makes us feel that we are experiencing everything.  I cannot say enough how impressed I was with the ambition, scale, and triumph of 'Children of Men.'  It's one of those films that makes you wonder... why aren't more made this way?",

Whether it be the parallels of paranoia towards government dictatorships, refugee camps and foreign prejudices or the internal conflicts that echo the images of the recently occurring Israel/Palestinian clash, Cuaron's sci-fi becomes continually disturbing with each passing year. And while many of these themes have been explored before (\"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes\" being the latest), \"Children of Men\" contains such a stronger punch simply due to the look of the film. Set in the futuristic London (and with half the budget of most blockbusters), Cuaron has ditched the CGI effects usually associated with the sci-fi genre for a desolate and harrowing set design that seems utterly real. The substitution of such special effects is crucial, not only does it enhance the viewing experience, but also contributes the scary reality of Cuaron's vision not merely being a work of fiction, but rather a possible prophecy.\r\n\r\nWhile all this sounds rather pessimistic (which it is), the narrative arc of Theo (Clive Owen) provides the emotional core. A cynical man in a cynical world, the combination of such elements could of made this feature a drag. But nevertheless, with the help of a brilliant low-key performance by Michael Caine, there is great chemistry shared between both actors and some much needed humour. And while Theo is a character surrounded by violence and desolation, the film never forgets the poignant moments that provide a crucial connection for the audience (his final gesture is simultaneously melancholic and uplifting). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the main contribution to the realness of the film is Cuaron's direction and his ability to situate the audiences within the action. Opening with a riveting explosion that sets the tone for internal conflict and paranoia that the world inhabits; a great panning shot within a car that perfectly reflects the disarray of a harrowing attack by savages and a memorable tracking shot that echoes Kubrick's direction in \"Full Metal Jacket\" to represent the fine line between life and death in combat, Cuaron continually proves his ability as a director of action. And most importantly, the director does not self-indulge in this visual trickery, but rather only uses such directing techniques when needed to enhance the viewing experience. Essentially, \"Children of Men\" offers all the best qualities of the sci-fi genre and displays Cuaron's amazing capabilities as a director.",

The film takes place twenty years after, where humanity is at the edge of extinction; the United Kingdom is the only country with a stable government so immigrants from all over the world are fleeing the chaos by trying to get inside making the UK apply extreme migration laws. Theo Faron is an activist that's gotten himself into the duty of scolding the only pregnant woman in the world through all this chaos, to a group call \"Human Project\" in order to give humanity a hope to salvation. \nWhen you hear the film\u00b4s premise you immediately set your expectations high just because of its originality and cleverness, and I more than glad to say that \"Children of Men\" is an excellent film that succeeds in every single element. The first thing that has to be praised is the direction and cinematography, they literally make you feel like you are there with the characters and the use of tracking shots enhance this and help tremendously the atmosphere of this dystopian future; the story is intense, clever, straightforward, entertaining  and captivating with a well written script; the acting is at pair with the phenomenal directing and writing with Clive Owen being the biggest highlight by giving a terrific performance; the mixture of drama, suspense and action it's done perfectly; the fast pace is effective and it gives the audience all the necessary information and smartly leaves some questions to the imagination in order to enhance the world that Cuar\u00f3n has established, the religious subtext of faith and hope is done in a effective way but the political and social themes are really heavy-handed. \n\"Children of Men\" is an intense film that will hook you till the end with is clever story and extravagant directing/cinematography. One of the best films of the 2000\u00b4s",

The year is 2027, people are getting killed across the globe, and women have become somehow infertile. The disasters around the film makes viewers feel like World War III is happening.\n\nFormer activist Theo Faron (Owen) is exposed to a situation that may involve him putting his life at risk. A girl named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) is pregnant. In a time where London is corrupt with violence, women not being able to have babies, and naturalistic sections, Theo must do all he can to get Kee to a sanctuary out at sea.\n\nFaron's assistant Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) acts like he cares about Kee's safety. Later, Theo hears a conversation with Luke and his henchmen that they plan to take Kee's baby once it is born. This causes Theo to get away from Luke, but the world is so un-structured where help is useless.\n\nIn \"Children of Men\" there is a way to survival-and it is risky-but it does not lack in being cinematic. \"Children of Men\" is extremely realistic. Theo's tasks: which consists of dangerous paths, shoot-outs, explosions, and helping Kee with her baby-is as cinematic as the characters' performances. With the film's dramatic ending, all of the disturbing moments work to make the film believable.\n\nThe climax of the movie is gory. This is where shootings get so violent that blood even hits the camera lens and remains on the lens for five minutes. This is where Cuaron wants a reaction from his viewers. A scene with multiple wounds and blood splattering the movie is as disturbing as \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\"\n\nOverall a thrill ride that is disturbing...but a work of art to look real.",

They should stop.  Hot actors, unoriginality, and no story are not enough.).  Adapted from P. D. James' dystopian novel The Children of Men, the film is set in 2027 in a dystopian future where human infertility has affected all woman worldwide, society on the brink of collapse, and the last functioning government is in the UK, where they impose oppressive immigration laws on refugees and illegal immigrants seeking sanctuary there.  When a female refugee turns out to be pregnant (the only in the world), a bureaucrat must help her get to safety and save her child.  The adaptation manages to be a lot of things at one time that connect to make the film what it is; an action thriller, political statement on infertility and illegal immigration, society's struggle to live, and a cautionary tale about the possible future.  There are warnings of humanity's intentions and choices towards political and social subjects, which highlight the dystopian elements found in the story, and provoke social commentary.  The action sequences are impressive, especially the one-shot chase scene following an ambush on a country road, which lasts 247 seconds, or 4 minutes, 7 seconds.  There are other single-shot sequences in which Kee, the pregnant refugee, gives birth (199 seconds, or 3 minutes, 19 seconds.  You people should expect spoilers every time I do my reviews.  You notice them, so expect them.), and where the bureaucrat Theo is captured by the Fishes, the group transporting Kee to safety, escapes, and runs down the street and through a building during a raging battle (378 seconds, or 6 minutes, 18 seconds).  These single-shot sequences require the right cinematographer, and Emmanuel Lubezki was the right man for the job, and received an Oscar nod for all his hard work.  He is able to capture the right angle and necessary content in each shot, including the single-shot sequences, showcasing top-notch camera work.  Alfonso Cuar\u00c3\u00b3n, Timothy J. Sexton, David Arata, Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, and even an uncredited Clive Owen are able to input complex themes and characterization into the script, but are also able to showcase top-notch screenwriting, and all bit Owen received an Oscar nod for their work.  Cuar\u00c3\u00b3n is also excellent as the film's director, capturing each scene to a fault, as well as make sure each scene is done to perfection, as evidenced in the 12 days it took to film the road ambush, but never received a Best Director nod for his hard work (do the voters at the Academy lack any respect or even heart?  The ****?).  Anyway, the film also benefits from its cast, including Clive Owen as Theo, Julianne Moore as Julian, Michael Caine as Jasper, and Clare-Hope Ashitey as Kee.  The entire cast is able to capture the right reactions to certain scenes and situations occurring throughout the film.  They reach the acting standards necessary for Children of Men.  The film was an unfortunate box office failure, but didn't deserve that fate as there's enough complexity and action to keep audiences centrifuges throughout the surprisingly short film as it's 109 minutes (1 hour, 49 minutes long), but could satisfy the people who have restrictive limits on run time.  Overall, the film is a must-see, as well as one of the best book adaptations, and one of the best films of the 2000s.",

Thematically complex and visually gritty , with a brilliant screenplay and some gut - wrenching imagery this journey works on every possible level out there. To a entertainment enthusiast it is a  raw action thriller gritty set in a post apocalyptic world but within that flows a beautiful tale of humanity . Going deeper and one can keep doing that , the films opens up like petals of a rose. The film is filled with visual and scenic imagery of human life & it's themes. This movie deals with the true horrors of war more than most other movies - no sugarcoating the reality that lies within it. Here death happens as it normally happens , when you see life getting lost in an eye blink without any element of dramatization you tend to ask yourself a lot of questions as a viewer. Although this movie can affect certain religious sects and activists what the film deals with is the plurality of religious riots and wars without pointing its finger at any particular sect. The tale of a young refugee who holds the key to the survival of humanity , preserving humanity from an apocalypse takes us right back to the basic themes- what are the wars actually fought for !  The reasons  behind wars are not literal as they can appear in the pages. To the female friends , certain elements of the film stands as a symbolic guardian as to a girl being the key to save mankind and the only way is to have another girl. No awkward dialogues in the screenplay turns even certain scenes which could have been corny into great and powerful images. One particular scene that will send a shiver down the spine would be  amidst the war and armies the baby is being taken out  and everyone who was fighting against each other stopped - the baby being used as a symbol of unity , hope and reason. Apart from being a very complex film , the movie delivers excellent pace. Imagery is a powerful tool and it surely delivers in this movie - the camera is like a third person mostly perspective based in telling the story. Use of handheld cameras in the most efficient way adds a lot dynamic feel to the story. The climatic sequences and even the earlier parts of the movie it felt as if a real life person was there documenting the whole thing  even the battle aftermath. Use of long shots keeps the tension , behind the shoulders and all those traditional use of handheld cameras as an art  form are brilliantly done. Visually its rich , high contrast but desaturated images and gritty shades adds to the realism of the film. Decent score adds to the dramatic elements of the film. Good performance from Clive Owen throughout. The setting and the production values are excellent even within the small budget of the film : The movie is a perfect collaboration of various art forms as under the direction of the genius Alfonso Cuaron \"Children Of Men\" will be one of those underrated masterpieces",

In 2027, the human race has been infertile for 18 years, the world has descended into global chaos while Britain has become a brutal military police state, with terrorist bombings frequently happening and immigrants in refuge camps. Bureaucrat Theo Faron (Clive Owen) finds himself reunited with his estranged with Julian (Julianne Moore) who needs a favour, so Theo goes to government minister and cousin Nigel (Danny Huston) to get backing. Julian wants Theo to escort immigrant Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), along with activist Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and ex-midwife Miriam (Pam Ferris) to the coast, but they have to dodge activists, double crossing and the police.

I totally loved the concept, of a world where only one country remains with a functioning government, all women are unable to become/maintain pregnancy, humankind is on the brink of extinction... never seen/heart/thought anything like it! Now the way I usually pick who will die/who will survive has something to do with the character importance, and I never would have thought Julian would die! I was totally shocked. I love love love dystopian films and books, and I loved this so much. It was, to me, ruthless! Its action (which I normally hate) fit into the plot line 100%, and it was not used as a movie filler, which I find it so often is. It was nice, as well, having main characters who stood their own ground, had their own beliefs that were vocalised etc. rather than the \"everyone just agrees with everyone\" or the \"people are easily swayed to believe the things everyone else believes in\", but not this movie. I just loved it!! A must see :)",

The settings are fantastic, the world the characters live is breathtaking, and Cuar\u00f3n brings this world to life in a way that makes me believe its real. The mise-en-sc\u00e9ne and documentary style shows the true essence of the world. Giving the audience a sense of realism and making the story believable.\r\n\r\nOur man character Theo is a man walking about in a world torn apart and is so far gone from reality that he seems like a zombie. He's clueless to the things around him or doesn't really quite care anymore. You are introduced to the death of someone special and see why he's like this. Driven by money, he's assigned to a a case by his ex-wife. He changes overtime when he discovers something strange and a miracle about the women. This character development is shown through the fantastic acting of Clive Owen and he displays it beautifully.\r\n\r\nThe end of the movie is spectacular and concludes the movie is a fantastic way. Even when a miracle shows itself, the humans aren't willing to settle differences around a issue. Making the miracle just another sign to continue in their fight for power. Seems to be when someone is not willing to change to help the greater good. They should be eliminated and that's exactly what happens. A moving and powerful movie that for the first time might go over the heads. The second time allows the person to really pay attention. Giving a new light to the movie. I could go on and on about the greatness of the movie. Great movie and truly Cauar\u00f3n's best work. 9.7/10",

Well, the point of the movie is not the technology, but still, it bothered me. Otherwise, I didn't feel something weird.\n\nI like what Alfonso did to the cinematography. Instead of lying on many scene angles, he decided to follow the main character(like he did with \"Gravity\") I think it is what differentiate his movies with others. He has his own style. I like what he did with the city background, too. It perfectly crafted as the world that didn't use to be. The scene that made it great is the revelation of baby. When people stop the war when they saw the first birth after 18 years, there is a sublime message about how a birth and hope could tame the wild of life. The best scene in this movie! I love Cuaron (no homo)\n\nThe most character improvement is Syd, I think. I like his style and all that accent and cruel jokes. He still worth it even he is a not-really-antagonist(he never had a chance to know Faron's group motive, amirite?)\n\nThis is a great movie for you sci-fi lovers, and a great movie for you fictional military political Iraq adaptation war(I don't what I am talking) movie. You'll regret to miss this one.",

Into this mix comes Clive Owen, the world weary ex-freedom fighter, who is pulled back into this clandestine world by an unorthodox visit from his ex-wife (Julianne Moore). So what's it all about? Well, that's not something we get many answers to. After a nod to Casablanca with Owen obtaining letters of transit for a crucial plot device, the MacGuffin is dutifully put into service to enable our hero to get from A to B. But the plot is irrelevant to the ultimate star of this movie; breathtakingly brilliant cinematography which evokes a believable dystopian near-future. The production design is so authentic it creates one of those rare things in movies, a feeling of actually being there.

            "content": "20 years into the future, 2027 to be exact, people haven't been able to breed new life in 18 years, and with the death of the youngest living human, an 18-year-old named \"Baby Diego,\" the world is looking even bleaker. Suicides are increasing with heavily advertised drugs offering an over the counter way of making it easier to die. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite nearly dying in a terrorist bombing, government worker Theo Faron isn't worried about what's going on around him, until his ex-wife Julian shows up after years to ask him a favor. She's now leading a rebel group called the Fishes who need to get a young immigrant girl named Kee to the Human Project, an organization trying to solve the issue of the world's infertility. The appropriately named girl has a secret one that could possibly change the face of this dire global situation, and Theo finds himself having to guide her to the British coast. Even after being abducted by his ex-wife, Theo seems relatively unaffected as they ride calmly through the countryside giving them a chance to reconnect, a brief moment of optimism that's cut short as Theo and Kee end up on the run, not only from the police, but also the rebels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis incredible premise and vision is only partially what makes \"Children of Men\" so spectacular, the other part being Clive Owen himself. This very well could be Owen's best film as he plays a real person suffering from a great loss, but trying to endure and remain positive. Owen does a heck of a job acting as the viewer's eyes, the camera staying on him the entire film so we can see how the horrors of this world ultimately affect him. As grim as the future may be, the film allows for a few moments of humor in order to make light of a serious situation, much of it coming from Owen's cynical delivery and his interactions with Kee, played with suitable naivety by newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey. Most of the film's more entertaining moments involve Michael Caine as Theo's weed smoking hippy friend Jasper who has a much more cordial view about the situation of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Theo and Kee arrive at a refugee camp with the help of Jasper's police friend Syd. It's not the best place for them to be, especially when the rebel uprising shows up, followed by the army turning the entire camp into a full upscale war zone. As Theo desperately tries to find Kee after being separated from her, the camera stays on him for an incredible extended long shot that puts the viewer into the middle of the warfare {like a first person video game}, as Theo tries to avoid being killed in the ensuing firefight. When someone nearby gets shot, splattering blood on the camera lens, it only takes you out of the moment for a split second. The impact of this climactic sequence makes you realize that you're watching something that's never been accomplished on a film, and it's something that's likely to be studied by film school students well past the year in which the film is set. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the future depicted in \"Children of Men\" bears any resemblance to reality, things aren't getting any better. Despite that sad worldview, Cuar\u00f3n uses this dark ideal future to show that however bad the world may get, there's always hope plus optimism on the horizon. As a whole the experience is effective at leaving you emotionally drained and breathless at the same time.",

In addition to this, the film is filled with deeper symbolism that gives it endless replay value if you are the kind who likes to dig deep into a film's ideas. It's full of stand-out scenes with a strong story to fit and enough action to keep our eyes wide open throughout, and we get rewarded for that too. To see so much well-executed in one film is rare indeed.\r\n\r\nWe need to start with the film's look because that's probably the most impressive feature of the film. Realism and science fiction don't tend to go together but this one has so many tricks up its sleeve that it's fully-immersive and hauntingly believable throughout. The single-take shots that mirror news footage of wars are astoundingly brilliant to look at but also deeply harrowing and maintain the tone throughout as well as adding extra kicks to the action scenes and making the film stand out beyond its somewhat typical plot. The amount of work that went into the shots is insane- they often aren't actually single takes (which would be hard enough) but also complex mash ups of several takes made to seem like one continuous piece of footage- it's superbly done.\r\n\r\nThe plot, a wild and oblique nativity story of sorts, isn't anything deeply sophisticated and so it fits well to the action genre. Because the action is so well-done, the story isn't lacking at all but it never feels like the main part of the movie, the surroundings are really what captures our imaginations.\r\n\r\nWe've got a near-future Britain in the year 2027 with the world in upheaval and the very real threat of human existence dying off due to widespread-infertility. It never feels distant from now though and its references to past stains like Nazism make it feel completely possible and thus deeply saddening. The attention to detail put into the creation of time and place fits so well with the unique shooting of the film and when they are combined there's more atmosphere and tension than you'll find in most horror films never mind in action movies or sci-fi flicks. \r\n\r\nThe performances are strong too (though Caine's didn't appeal to me) with the whole cast feeling relatively disposable amidst the world at war depicted in the film which makes for an unpredictable story. There's also the so very rare narrative that allows the viewer to ultimately see what they want to in the story's progression and conclusion. It gives us all we need to feel our own emotions and never pushes us one way or the other.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to pick faults with the film but its heavy atmosphere doesn't always fit well with its fairly fast-progressing story. It's rare to see a film doing what this one does that clocks in at less than two hours and I think slower pacing could have improved the film as the action scenes included are so well-done that we can afford some more space in between them to develop the story further.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue isn't really memorable and there sometimes feels like conflict within what the film is trying to achieve- the action and the moody drama don't always seem to be in unison with each other. It also seems to struggle at times to portray what the source material by P.D. James does, with some things feeling like a bit of a blur amongst the other going-ons in the film.\r\n\r\nThese are small issues though that really don't take away from the film's overall experience- it's a must-see as both an action film and a science-fiction and the social commentary and impactful themes make it a unique and memorable experience.

I really had no idea what this film was before seeing it, my friends told me that it was brilliant so I checked it out immediately (thanks George and Matt!). What makes this film the masterpiece it is, is the originality and execution of it all. This could have been some over the top Sci-Fi movie but it wasn't because the writers created this dark and realistic world that took place in the future. I absolutely loved the world these writers created because it's something very different from what we've seen before and I thought that was incredible. The writers also did an excellent job at writing the story, I've seen this type of story done before but it's just the way it was all executed. The type of story I talk about is a group of people go on one journey to get to point A to point B but like I said, it's all in the execution. The writers also do a very good job at adding some interesting elements to the story that were all done very well, overall this was just a fantastic story that was completely original. When it comes to the writing you cant forget the dialogue, the dialogue in this film was written very well and even though this is a pretty dark movie some of the dialogue was pretty witty. I also cant forget about the characters, all the main characters were written very well and had enough background for me to care about them. Now let me talk about the directing which was brilliant. Alfonso Cuaron's style in this film just completely blew me away. Cuaron knows how do create suspense and tension by putting the camera in one place and just keeping it there, also the lack of music in those scenes also created suspense. One thing I liked about his style is that it kind of felt like a documentary, plus the cinematography and his style was a match made in heaven because the cinematography was gorgeous. The acting in this film was nothing short from phenomenal. Clive Owen gives a knockout performance, Julianne Moore was great for her role, and Michael Caine was actually quite hysterical as a drug dealer. The supporting cast is also magnificent which includes Claire-Hope Ashitey, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Pam Ferris. In the end Children of Men is one of the most accomplished films in the past decade and is a film that I highly recommend checking out.",

            "content": "Some films are great, have an amazing cast, fantastic direction, and unbelievable potential. This film had all the above. A superb cast to hold up almost any movie, great, great direction, and potential that makes you scream when you see the film not fully use it. I wanted to scream so loud during this movie. Yes, it is definitely a great film, just short from amazing, but this movie does not use it's premise to it's full ability, and denies much room for us to take in everything that is happening. Children of Men has some of the biggest potential I've seen in any film with a plot like this and a world like this, but it does not use it how it should have. It' one hell of a ride going through this movie, but it's more of something like Space Mountain, rather than something much more brilliant and huge, like Soarin. But Space Mountain was still fantastic.\r\n\r\n   Children of Men is a 2006 drama sci-fi films directed by Alfonso Cuaron and written by numerous people starring Clive Owen, Julliane Moore, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Michael Caine. But the main star of this film, is no other than the director Alfonso Cuaron. What he does with this movie, splitting it up into almost 1-5 minute single shots makes this movie amazing. I have always been an admirer of single shots, but what he does in this movie makes you totally forget you are even watching single shots. And single shots are simply the hardest to direct in my opinion, having to get everyone completely right, and if you mess up halfway through a twenty minute shot, you have to start it over. So to direct single shots you need great patience, an understanding of the set and the actors and the whole entire layout, and a keen eye for timing, because in this film if the timing isn't done right, the whole film messes up. But the film did not mess up here. Every shot is perfectly paced, perfectly set up, perfectly designed, and in the end it nearly makes the film a ten out of ten. But one thing held that back. The potential.\r\n\r\n   This film had some of the greatest potential I've ever seen in movies. An original idea, a great cast, great director, and decent plot, but this film had room for so much more. A world of possibilities, exploring what has happened to a world without infertility and a world that has been pushed to it's own extinction. It's one of the smartest films I've ever seen, but it could've been a lot more. We could've explored this world and everything it had to offer, a world full of intelect and drama all put into one film would be fantastic. But the script was reduced to an adventure film with additions of bad guys, some that would've have mattered very much. Still, for the screenplay as it is, it's a very good plot with great characters. The acting in this film is superb, with Clive Owen being the perfect leading man in this film. His struggle through the film as a simply government middle-man to a man of understanding and a hero is not wholly original, but the way it was executed was. Children of Men provides one of the greatest premises of modern film, one that should've been thought of long ago. Not many questions are answered about the problem of infertility in the film, though, but it's fine. The film takes on all the aspects as well as it can in a limited amount of time. The film simply should've explored more \"what if\" possibilities, one that is endless from viewers from this kind of film. But still, the big \"what if\" in this film is concluded and learned about, and the \"what if\" of humanity is also understood in the few seconds before the credits roll by some audio.\r\n\r\n   All in all, Children of Men is really good. Some aspects of the film should've been explored more, though, while others aspects should've been realized, as well. With a good cast, fantastic direction, and an original plot, I only wonder why this film didn't use all it's potential to it's full ability. So many characters could've been explored, so many side plots we could've cared about should be in there, and just a world of great storytelling lies in the premise of this film. But I guess if this film was to have all that, it might as well be a TV show, but this film is not that. It is a film. And, despite all my wantings from it, one of the best I've seen in a while. 8/10.\r\n\r\nAnd please, if you are interested in hearing my thoughts or listening me talk more about this film, check out my podcast!

A fantastic look at a Dystopian Apocalypse laid ahead by a freak accident.\n\nWhat completely made me love this film was the beautiful directing style done by Cuaron that moved the story in such a pristine way. The constant one-long shots were magnificent and helped enrich the viewer.\n\nClive Owen is a heavily underrated actor, in my opinon, and deserves more recognition. His performance was phenomenal and breath-taking. Michael Caine also did a wonderful job in a supporting role. Mainly the only two performances that stood out.\n\nOverall, This film is beautiful in every aspect and is criminally underrated.",

Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voices.\"\n\nEvery night on weekdays, my father and sister watch their nightly soap operas. Whenever a \"tense\" confrontation happens in the show, my father says to me, \"This is getting real heavy,\" Those shows ain't got nothing on this movie. Children of Men has to be one of the most heavy-hearted, if not depressing, films I've seen. \n\nAfter the youngest person in an infertile world dies at 18 years old, hope for mankind is lost. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a lowly office worker from London, is recruited by his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) to get a young Fuji immigrant across borders. Though Britain is one of the only stable nations left in the world, there is an escalating war between the national police and rebels. While reluctant to help Julian with transporting her young Fuji friend, he soon finds out that she is much more important than he thought she was. After a dangerous turn of events, the only key to mankind's salvation is suddenly put in Theo's hands. \n\nOne of the most outstanding things about this film was that it feels similar to a modern action film, even if the theme and mood of the whole film was completely different. The film wonderfully fuses drama and science fiction, set against the backdrop of dystopia mostly in the midst of a war. While most films would unbalance the three different genres, this one executes perfectly. \n\nOne problem I'd have with this film would be the overwhelmingly depressing mood. While I didn't exactly hate the mood entirely, it wouldn't exactly be a film you'd want to watch when feeling down. \n\nWhat probably intrigues me about this film the most, was its theme of hope and faith in the face of darkness and despair. It's a theme I usually see in kids' movies, but what those movies lack, and what this film does, is that there aren't any melodramatic overtones. The ending was probably the best scene in the film. There was subtlety and suspense, and there was one part of you that thought that it wasn't gonna end right there. There wasn't going to be any sappiness or sentimentality. There were going to be consequences. *SPOILERS* The final shot of Kee quietly trying to comfort her baby through singing, and Theo slowly sliding into unconsciousness from a possibly fatal gunshot wound was perfect. You wouldn't know if there was going to be a slightly happy ending (because \"slightly happy\" is all this film is going to get). Is the Human Project real? If they were, are they good guys, or are they just like Luke and his Fishes? Does Theo die? Will Kee's baby actually help mankind? You wouldn't for sure. All these questions cause the suspense. The subtlety comes from the simple long take of a new mother comforting her baby. Once they mixed, everything became perfect. *END OF SPOILERS* Overall, I think this film deserves a 4.5 out of 5 because it lets you take in all the little things (performances, themes), it keeps you glued to the screen, and it lets you care about the characters in a way no ordinary post-apocalyptic drama film can.",

It also has this way of making everything in the movie seem baron and cold. Now, this is a dark movie. It's about a pandemic that makes everyone in the world infertile and Clive Owen has to protect the last pregnant women and get her to safety. But the visuals and the cinematography makes everything seem cold and in a way dull...and it is awesome. The best parts of the movie are when they are showing you this world that these people live in. It looks tired in a way and it's all the more interesting.\nFrom the opening sequence you are pulled into this world. It's not post-apocalyptic, but it's close. Here's a SPOILER ALERT so if you want to see this, don't read on. So, the opening shows Clive Owen walking into a coffee shop to buy some coffee. On the television it's saying that the youngest person on earth has just died and everyone in the shop is crying or looking at the TV in disbelief. Owen decides not to stick around and he walks out and walks down the street. Then all of a sudden the coffee shop explodes and it goes to the main title. It's so cool and it really gives you an idea of what you're getting in for.\nThe rest of the movie is incredible too, but there is one scene that I want to talk about that I thought was phenomenally done. It's near the end after Owen has delivered the baby and after the mother was taken away. Owen finds her by listening to the sound of the baby crying and he gets into an apartment building and outside all hell is breaking lose. London is trying to revolt and the Army started coming and everyone is dying outside and it was tough for Clive Owen to even get to the building. So he gets up there by listening to the baby and when he gets to the floor he sees everyone in the hallway looking down it trying to see if that is actually a baby's cry. All you hear is the baby and the guns outside and Owen walks down there and finds the mother and the baby and leads them out while everyone in the hallway is touching the baby and in complete disbelief. This part is so cool right here. So Owen and the mother are walking down the stairs and the Army barges in and are screaming to like shoot, but when the soldier sees the baby he stops and then screams, \"hold you fire!\" Then as the two are walking out the soldier's part to two sides and make a path for them. Some soldiers fall to their knees, some are praying, and most of them are just looking at this baby astonished with their mouths gaping. This moment is priceless. Everything is so silent. All you can hear are the gunshots in the distance. It is so cool and it's so incredibly eerie and genuine that it puts you in a state in which you are in utter awe. Then there's an explosion and the place goes quickly back to a state of chaos. \n\tThis whole movie is like this though. It's so genuine and just so real even though it's a fictional and highly unlikely story. Part of this goes to the actors for their phenomenal jobs throughout the movie and a lot of it goes to the director who created this world with the most finesse and skill. I feel like this is how people would really act during this sort of situation. It would be devastating but this made it look really cool. As I said before, Children of Men is a masterpiece and will go down as a sci-fi classic.",

The futuristic atmosphere is so intelligently created by Cuaron and without heavy use of special effects. The action scenes are especially realistic and well-made without campy choreography. It's a thought provoking film about a future gone wrong. This is very memorable because it analyzes the plot more than the violence and has little action clich\u00e9. It will leave you breathless by the time it finishes. Compelling performances only add to the overall experience, which is far better than average action films. This look at a bleak future is one of the better of its time and genre.",

I never believed the world that Alfonso Cuaron tried to create because while it is dressed in a depressingly dark style, the characters do not operate as if the human race's horrible condition is of any relevance. For example there are no fertile women left in the world, but when one woman is revealed to be pregnant, the militant revolutionary group called the Fishes decides that they want the woman's baby to use as a political tool for their coming revolution. How exactly the baby would be any good against the police state, I do not know. But what really left me scratching my head was that Clive Owen's character tells the pregnant woman that she will be killed for her baby. I understand that the only way the Fishes could take the baby away would be to kill the mother, but here's where that looses me: The human race is on the brink of extinction due to infertility and the Fishes actually want to kill the first pregnant woman in years? That really understates how horrible the human condition is when the characters in the film don't even realize it. Also, the film's political correctness is just appalling.",

Now a woman becomes fertile, after 18 years in history. Clive Owen acts well, but the real cherry here is Michael Caine. I totally ignore Julianne Moore.

            "content": "Dystopian futures have been a staple in the movies since Metropolis in 1927. They can range from cutting edge (The Matrix) to ridiculous (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). One thing all of them should have in common: they should immerse the audience into the new world they have created. This world is the driving force of Children of Men, a unique take on the future of mankind. Writer/Director Alfonso Curaon crafts a wonderful tale of despair, mystery, heroism, and suspense as Children of Men pushes its hero, Theo (Clive Owen) further into the desolation of a dying Britain. \r\n\r\nA great tragedy has befallen humanity in 2027. The youngest person in the world has just died. He was 18 years old, because humanity has become infertile starting in 2009 (for reasons unknown). Right after the death, Theo unexpectedly gets a call from his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore), who is active in a group of rebels fighting the British government. She asks him to escort a group out of Britain to a society called the Human Project. The group includes Julian, Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the leader of the insurrection, Miriam (Pam Ferris), a voodoo worshipper, and Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey). The reason for the aid of Theo and secrecy is a whopper: Kee is pregnant. Theo must navigate through multiple treacheries including betrayal, power grabs, and lots of weapons. \r\n\r\nFrom its first scene, Curaon tells you there is something a little off about our current setting. His dying society bears an uncanny resemblance to a war torn Europe post-WW II. The color scheme is destaturated to paint the world in bleak grays. For every LCD billboard there are 10 poor homeless people staring at them. The uniqueness of showcasing a future society as one the audience has seen in the past makes it easier for the audience to understand 2027 Britain as well as provide a terrifying paradox of a future society than cannot advance. This hauting image of a poverty-stricken, urgent, dying society is elevated using a hand-held camera with long unbroken takes. By experiencing the world with the characters instead of above them, Curaon transplants humanizes this lovelorn place and allows the audience to personally feel the character's pain. \r\n\r\nIf only Curaon's script could match his setting. Overall, the script is very strong and emotionally competent. There is a violent unexpected attack in the first 5 minutes of the picture, which sets the script up for lots of twists and turns as the story goes along. There are two inherent problems for the story though: The Human Project is a macguffin (for those who don't know, a macguffin is a Hitchcock term describing a plot element providing motivation for a character's actions that is not explained to the audience), and the direction of the story is the path of least resistance. What this means is that the story does not bother explaining the epidemic of infertility or how a new baby will survive in the current setting. Instead, the script focuses on the consequences of the baby ending up with the rebellion or the government. Despite the macguffin, Children of Men's script does a great job of showing character depth and progression while providing some really suspenseful chase sequences and unexpected acts of heroism along the way.\r\n\r\nThe acting ranges from solid to great. Clive Owen is very good as Theo. The script gives him a haunted past, which he uses to push himself into perpetually more dangerous scenarios. Chiwetel Ejiofor showcases impressive complexity for a character that could have had one note to his personality. Pam Ferris and Clare-Hope Ashitey (in her 2nd role) provide spunk and determination to the story, and Michael Caine (as Theo's hippie friend) and Julianne Moore are always great. The one failing is that the government and rebellion are essentially faceless entities, making their causes unimportant to the central characters.\r\n\r\nChildren of Men is one of those rare instances where at the end we wish there was more time to explore the consequences of the story. It leaves you with plenty of questions about the fragility of humanity and the unsteady equilibrium of peace the world revolves around. Children of Men could make for a great TV miniseries; until that day, Alfonso Curaon's adaptation of P.D. James's novel is a cautionary tale about the value of human life that won't leave your thoughts very easily.",

James, is very evenly paced and has a certain gripping effect on the viewer, right until the very last minutes. Cinematography is perfectly moody and obscure, making the futuristic London look like a war-infested playground where no one is safe. The film shows how - in difficult, brutal times of infertility - one man tries to save a miraculously pregnant woman from the omnipresent chaos. This man named Theo, firstly a typical bureaucratic non-believer, starts to follow his senses and begins to show his true nature, as the bold and protective man on a dangerous mission towards the rebirth of mankind. The film follows closely all the events up to the climatic moment of an immigrant uprising and the thrilling battle for life and death. The camera movement is greatly exhilarating, and makes the viewer feel as though he is right in the middle of the whole action. The performances are believable, as the actors we see on screen are able to denude all their deepest emotions, bravely exhibiting fear, angst, anxiousness, and even faith in a forthcoming happy ending. Overall, it's truly a violent, heartbreaking, intriguing, full-bodied sci-fi worth watching.",

            "content": "As a thriller, the film is blisteringly intense and incredibly effective. From the bomb blast that caps off the opening credits to the frenzied urban warfare sequences that dominate the film's closing thirty minutes, Cauron never lets the film lag. Though it slows down enough to deal with character development and exposition, the film maintains a running intensity as Theo and Kee try to stay one step ahead of terrorists, the police, the army and random opportunists. Several action scenes are shot in continuous takes, and make for compelling and electrifying viewing.However, the film works as a socio-political drama as well. Though Cauron's two central messages (that immigrants enrich, rather than threaten, Western society, and that the outlook for human survival is dim when operatives on all sides let ideology displace compassion and good judgment) are strongly put, he is never so heavy-handed that they dominate or displace the actual storyline. Similarly, while the film makes numerous metaphorical references to present-day events, they are never so contrived as to derail the narrative.The film features solid performances from Clive Owen, who is at his rugged, rumpled best, and Julianne Moore. Supporting players also do well: Michael Caine is terrific as Theo's pot-growing hippie friend, the versatile Chiwitel Ejiofor is again in fine form as a revolutionary cell leader, and Pam Ferris is also good as another of Kee's protectors. It is, however, Claire-Hope Ashitey who stands out as the illegal immigrant who may well be humanity's hope for the future.Children of Men is packed with explosive action, incendiary social commentary and some white-hot performances. As a result, it may well be the best film of the year.",

            "content": "Children of Men is ultimately a sophisticated journey of the triumphs and failures of human nature. Director, Alfronso Cuaron has truly crafted a dark and riveting portrayal of a future with no hope, as all of the world's women have apparently become infertile. In this future, the world isn't much different from today. There are no flying cars, no robots, only dark city landscapes fluttering with litter, rubble, and despair. This future civilization is at its breaking point, and there are two opposing sides depicted in the storyline: A rebel group that is labeled as an extremist terrorist regime by the media, who's stated mission is to deliver a young woman, Kee, to the Human Project, which is a covert organization of some of the world's greatest minds who are collectively searching for a solution for the world's infertility. And then there is the government, which draws many parallels from Nazi Germany in its continuous propaganda on television and the banishment of desperate immigrants into essential exile in slum-like conditions which are fenced, guarded, and separated from the locals. There are many philosophical ideas throughout the entirety of this film; too many begin explaining as that would be an entire subject upon itself. And yes, there does exist some religious references in many parts of the film, some blatantly obvious, and others, metaphorically painted by the masterful strokes of director, Alfronso Cuaron. Surprisingly, Cuaron has knack for action and suspense, as many of the scenes and action sequences unfold with just one continuous camera shot, much like the D-Day invasion scene from Saving Private Ryan. In other words, not only are the action sequences jarring and suspenseful, they're also completely refreshing and unique. That said, (***SPOILER ALERT***) there is one sequence towards the very end of the film, where Theo is guiding Kee and her newborn baby from the deadly shootout between the rebels of the uprising and the military, and suddenly all of the bystanders (exiled immigrants) stand completely still in awe at the sight of this newborn. Gunshots continue to echo in the distance, yet the bystanders gather and pray at the sight of Kee's child. Theo and Kee continue further down the stairs, as they encounter the rebels, holding their guns, and then the soldiers, and to cap-off this utterly breathtaking and emotional scene, the soldiers are ordered to cease-fire at the sight of the baby. This scene is one of the few that I can ever say that brought tears to my eyes. It is very powerful indeed. And much like that scene, Children of Men is a riveting and powerful film, and it is very under appreciated in both its vision and brilliance.",

Its thought provoking, well acted, gritty and you could see this happening in real life sometime in the future.

Although it got high praise from critics, most people have seemed to pass this movie up and not notice it, probably because of it's plot.\n\nI'll first start off saying I'm not a big fan of these sort of movies that are set in the future. However, this was a very original film that looks like it's in the present, abandoning all those heavy sci-fi effects and stories.\n\nThis film deals with a man who returns to the activism fold, and is forced to do a very risky duty, on behalf of his ex-wife Julian. Once he sees what he has to accomplish, he has no choice but to do it. This is for a pregnant woman's safety, so he promises her he'll get her out of harms way so she can deliver her baby. Is he able to get her to safety's way, or will they be in great danger?\n\nAlthough some call it a sci-fi film, I highly recommend this to any drama or thriller fan who is not afraid to see something different.

The imagery is simply first rate, the cinematography filming evolutionary and the just the right mix of gorilla style with what seems like endless impossible long takes that are simply a joy to watch- even though the scenes sometimes are of destruction and war.

            "content": "Set in the year 2027, Children Of Men centers around a futuristic dystopia involving human infertility. No woman has been able to become pregnant for almost two decades, leaving humanity in a bitter epoch of despair. Illegal immigrants are rounded up in a totalitarian police state and centered off into refugee camps. Theo Faron (Clive Owen) plays a civil servant who must escort a young refugee woman, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) across the country. The reasons for doing so are non-essential for him. He's in it for the money, at least up until he finds out that Kee has become pregnant. Everything changes with this startling discovery, mainly with those who find out having their own motivations in mind. Kee's child becomes not so much a child, but a symbol for something greater. Wait for the scene where in the middle of an uprising it is discovered theres an infant trapped in the middle of it, everything pauses as the child in slowly taken from harms way in single-shot scene of pure emotion. Corny in explanation, but the film does it right, and with outstanding cinematography everything becomes gritty and the despair is etched onto every scene. This isn't just a grim future that's being painted, it's hell on earth. No one is safe, and nothing looks secure in any sense. That's why we're not all that shocked when Theo is kidnapped, gung-ho style in a scene and whisked away in a van. It looks like an everyday occurrence.\n\nOther notable performances by Julianne Moore round out the film, and of course there's the always excellent Michael Caine playing the secluded hippie Jasper. His role is far more relaxing as you find he takes refuge in a wooded out bungalow, smoking weed and living the lifestyle that seems in stark contrast with the piss poor future that this films portrays. If anything, Children Of Men offers a message of hope, and the idle idea that without children the world becomes an extremely scary place. There's never any exact explanation as to why women have become infertile, and perhaps a bit more would have been nice, but one thing is clear. It isn't so much that there are no more children that makes the world so dark, but what they represent. The scene within the broken down school is eerie and worth noting. Truly a world absent of children is a world in despair.\n\n-Stephen Febick 1/30/12",

The choreography on some of the single-shot action scenes is mind-boggling; I was astonished how real and explicit Britain looks in 2027. The long chains of events that take place after the death of one of the characters up until the discouraging ending sequence were the most impressive, particularly when the main leads are in prison. I was not so compelled with the story, though. It has its moments, but it was pretty fragile, doesn't really explore the characters that Clive Owen meets. There are films where an open-ended finale fits, however it just didn't really work in this one, very tasteless if you ask me. \"Children of Men\" is a decent picture about the end of mankind (or hope) that relies more on visuals than story, and of course the talents of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n.",

The story is moving, saving the last baby in the world and that is more than interesting for a story to as simple as possible. It has one of the most stunning visuals with those beautiful shots and camera angles that made this film so innovative. I was stunned for the whole 2 hours thinking this was made in the year 2007 and we should see more of this kind of films especially when Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n together with the brilliant performance of Clive Owen.

There is no deus ex machina, so much so that at times, the audience is even convinced that the situation is hopeless. In one of the most, if not the most powerful scene of the movie, Theo (Clive Owen) leads Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) through scores of fighting people, amidst gunfights and explosions, with the cries of an infant penetrating the din. For a moment, the fighting stops and all eyes turn to the child. For a moment, there is hope. The movie later ends with hope; but it comes shrouded in fog (quite literally). The Human Project mentioned throughout is an enigma that never truly takes form; but it is I believe, part of the intention. Much like Kee's baby, it is symbolic of hope, but it carries with it a measure of uncertainty. But then again, what true hope doesn't?",

Sure, it isn't a world any normal person would want to live in, but there are elements of plausibility to this tale. It is a world where nobody can be trusted, but these twists make perfect sense as everyone tries to bring the world this gift.\nSure, it's been done before, but I've never really believed this could be the real future we are heading for (minus the lack of children).

The movie uses every trick in the book several times over in order to make me feel sad or desperate -- but without compelling, fleshed-out characters or any positive moments of triumph, the depressing parts don't have anything to stand out against. The film as a whole works only to depress me, never letting up, adding layer upon layer of tragedy like the world's saddest birthday cake.\n\nThrow in some questionable directing choices and some of the most heavy-handed symbolism in any movie ever -- seriously, the woman who holds the key to restoring hope to humanity is named \"Key\" and the boat that will lead them to safety is called \"Tomorrow.\" You've got to be kidding me -- and you have a movie that tries far too hard, and in return gives me very little.\n\nChildren of Men is the desperate, over-eager intern of the film world.",

In a thrilling race against time, Theo will risk everything to deliver the miracle the whole world has been waiting for.\n\nDirected by Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban), 'Children Of Men' features outstanding performances from the following cast:\n1.) Clive Owen (Theo Faron)\n2.) Julianne Moore (Julian)\n3.) Michael Caine (Jasper)\n4.) Chiwetel Ejiofor (Luke)\n5.) Charlie Hunnam (Patric)\n6.) Clare-Hope Ashitey (Kee)\n\nAs I was watching 'Children Of Men' I was very impressed by the theme of a post-apocalyptic society where there is extreme infertility in mankind due to a population catastrophe following years of conflict and the collapse of civilization. And not only that - here the cinematography and background settings are so dramatic that I can't leave the screen without experiencing them all. Clive, Julianne, and everyone else in the cast also did outstanding acting here that I can understand their emotions well. With such flawless elements I can say that this is the BEST MOVIE EVER in the genres of science fiction and thriller - 'Children Of Men' is highly recommended that I'd like you to enjoy the film if you haven't seen it.

            "content": "If you have ever seen The Road, or 28 Days Later, you'll recognize the look of Children of Men. It's set in the future in a world that looks familiar, but it's dirtier, grittier and less safe than the world you're used to seeing.\n\nThe movie is set in Britain in 2027 and Theo Faron (Owen) learns through a newscast that the world's youngest person has died at the age of 18. Doesn't that sound odd? Have you ever heard a report that sounds anything like that? It immediately alerts us to the fact that something is wrong. We find out that all humans are infertile and no child has been produced for more than 18 years.\n\nIf people are no longer born, how long would it take for the world's existing population to die? What would happen to those already here, knowing that they will be among the last of their species?\n\nTheo visits his friend, Jasper (Michael Caine), who hides away in a house in the woods. Illegal immigrants are everywhere and government messages urge people to report them. Theo is abducted early in the story by Julian (Moore) who is his former lover. Movement within the country is restricted and she wants Theo to obtain transfer papers so that her group can take a young woman, Kee, to the coast and safety.\n\nIt's a brutal existence and Theo eventually finds himself as Kee's only hope. She's one of the most important people on the planet, but only a small group of people know why. Theo guards her to the best of his ability and attempts to get her to safety using a contact of Jasper's to help them. He accepts help whenever it's offered.\n\nSome of the street scenes would be more at home in a war movie. It seems that the military regularly clashes with civilians and every group has an agenda. It's a crazy existence where law and order is virtually non-existent, and it would be frightening to experience. Do the people have any goals at all that don't involve killing and stealing what they can from others? The military prefers to shoot first and ask questions later.\n\nIt impresses me that even though the world is a chaotic place and full of danger, the plot remains coherent. The audience is never in doubt about Theo's intentions; just his ability to succeed. The resolution won't make everyone happy. It's not clear what will happen in the future. This is a snapshot showing one key event in a seemingly hopeless situation. When it's all over, we are left with hope, and that's enough.",

I had heard only 'of' this film not abt it and didn`t get what i was expecting which is great way to go abt a viewing (knowing nothing to start) except for a good cast line up i had the open mind required,  it got wider and wider as acts scenes passed then i thought it was going smooth into an easily assumed plot and it got broader still (futuristic can be this way).\n\nSo this guy has this office job and a few bizzare things are afoot in the future year of 2017. He`s slightly involved in a random bohming and has an afternoon off at a society aware ex-spokspersons home, though talking of subjects of little consequence the movie sort of carries on. Things go  askew when he gets kiddnapped and asked to produce some things for the people of the rebel faction. The way in which this seems played down by the lead role (Clive Owen as Theo Faron) gets me all curious and the ride starts and dosn`t realy stop until a bitter truth ending. The fist third od the film isn`t much and seems a knormal pace but gets you really thing then the rest is of an action pace ordinary but seems alot faster, simple right, well you have to see to enjoy.",

            "content": "No, you fools; you just had to do this sick, twisted, unholy experiment and now humanity is doomed! Seriously guys, you just had to go and try to protect the key to restoring people's ability to have kids. Hey, I don't know about y'all, but this is probably the most appealing dystopian future I've seen yet, where there's no natural disaster thinning out our numbers, and on top of that, there are no more kids bothering us. Yeah, I know that sounds harsh, but if you've got any sense about you, it's not hard to tell that kids, and by extension, society are getting worse, so if we're facing human extinction, we may as well go out while we're... relatively ahead. I'm sure Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n doesn't want to get rid of kids, because if they weren't around, then he wouldn't have anyone seeing his films, because his most successful stuff have been about kids; and even then, \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" is the lowest grossing of all of the \"Harry Potter\" films (Yeah, like that's saying something) and this film didn't make it's budget back. Man, if this film not being terribly successful isn't a definate reflection of how sick our society is becoming, then I don't know what is, because while everyone is going around, enjoying Christmas 2006 with their stupid families and loved ones, this wonderful film about humanity killing itself upon realizing that it's on its last leg is going unseen. Well, as you can tell, I'm a delightful person; and for those who thought that this movie was flawless, then you're going to find me extra delightful, because I stand by my opinion (*cough*fact*cough) that there is no such thing as a flawless film; and sure enough, this film is not above that law.\r\n\r\nRight out of the gate, the film is heavily plagued by scientific inaccuracies. Yeah, like I'm suppose to believe that there would be destruction and violence going on because there are no more kids around. No, I know that's not scientifically inaccurate; I just can't get enough of the sounds of a world without kids. I'm sure that there would be plenty of danger and violence going on after universal fertility, which is considered a tragedy... for some reason, because, again, no kids. No, but seriously though, the film is very accurate in its portrayal of this world, but maybe too much so, overemphasizing both the differences and similaries that are found in the day-to-day by showing off a chain of superfluous sequences early on, during the development segment; and when we do transition into scenes of exposition, it's rather forced. As you would imagine, once the story picks up, it abandons those flaws, but brings along slowness that plagues the film heavily and leaves it unable to hold your attention from time to time; and just when you're getting into everything in the final act, Cuar\u00f3n does it again and pops out a big cop-out ending. Yes, the film's problems are limited, but that's, more often than not, a reflection on the underwhelmingness of a film, more than it is a reflection on the quality; and yet, as you would expect from Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, for every bit in the film that stands to be delivered more sharply, there is a solid strength just around the corner that swiftly and effectively enters to pull you back in.\r\n\r\nAs a visual experience, the film is a real treat, boasting Cuar\u00f3n's trademark bleakness with a dash of optimism in terms of lighting, as well as slickness and inventiveness in terms of camerawork. There are a good couple of sequences in the film that are all capture in one, single shot; and that is a trick that doesn't feel overbearing, but still remains effective, leaving it to perfectly pull you right into this world for quite the immersive experience. That trick works best during the action sequences, which may be rare, but really knock your socks off, being very well staged and, of course, filmmed well enough to where you feel like you're right there. This creates tension, as well as emotional resonance, because what action there is is still another piece in the storytelling; and with tension in the air - thanks to the immersive cinematography - that storytelling works wonderfully. Of course, it certainly helps that the story is a solid one, as well as believable. As much as I joked about the world being a better place without kids bothering everyone, there's absolutely no way that it would be, because the only thing on everyone's mind is the concept that they are facing the certain \"final generation of humanity\"; and the world Cuar\u00f3n presents is so carefully constructed, featuring very human characters with perfectly plausible cause and behavior, thus getting you really invested in this world and what people are left to occupy it. Of course, seeing as I always have to praise performances in a review, I have to say that this film wouldn't be as effective as it is without its wide cast of strong performers, particularly Clive Owen, who's subtle emotion and expressed inner conflict makes him both an effective avatar for the audience and a strong lead character by his own right.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the film is plagued by rather forceful storytelling early-on, but when the story picks up, it ironically \"drops\" in pace, becoming slow and periodically unengaging, but you keep coming back every time for - if nothing else - the handsome visual style that complements the bittersweet tone of this whole highly believable story, which also finds itself carried by the fine performances that help in making \"Children of the Men\" the overall fascinating and compelling experience that it is.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

James' novel (entitled The Children of Men) is a dark, dystopian tale of humanity in the near future. In the year 2035 every single human in the world is infertile. Theo (Clive Owen) is kidnapped by an immigrant rights group known as \"The Fishes\" whose leader is a former lover of Theo's named Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore) who seeks Theo's help in transporting an illegal immigrant to safety however this illegal immigrant harbours a miracle the world is in desperate need of. Children of Men is a gripping, emotionally engaging and thought provoking film that is helped considerably by one of Clive Owens's best performances, further fine performances of Moore and Michael Caine and Cuar\u00f3n's exceptional storytelling. Its themes of hope, religion and immigration (some scenes are disturbingly similar to conditions in concentration camps also a fascist British government force feeds propaganda down the public's throats) are presented rather well. Occasionally the script allows the characters to make dramatic speeches in the heat of battle that somewhat takes us out of how realistic the proceedings feel but the innovative single shot action sequences are tense and the viewers willingness for  the success of Theo's mission result in Children of Men being a truly outstanding film.\r\n\r\n4.5/5.",

Grappling with some heavy issues, while moving with serious speed and intensity, Children of Men bounds from one intricately crafted set piece to another and lets viewers peer into a world in which civilization has been upended because human women have inexplicably lost the ability to have babies. Director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wasn't shy about challenging the boundaries of single-take sequences, as well as loading his adaptation of the P.D. James novel with visual statements on man's cruelty to man and the folly of governing through fear. But he didn't linger on them. Instead, he trusts viewers to absorb the story's subtext and rewarded them with one of the best written dystopian sci-fi films ever. If nothing else, see it for the barnstorming single-take action sequences.",

Many times have works that feature otherworldly settings been praised as feeling lived-in, allowing the audience to insert themselves into the setting more completely. This seems literally true with Children of Men. The brilliant cinematography combined with the fantastic art design in all aspects of the work are the true stars here.

Had they allotted the film to be about as long as V for Vendetta, and really fleshed out the characters and how the world came to be I might have cared a bit more. I really got attached to Theo and Michael Caine's character. They were fun to watch, but for the most part I wasn't impressed with the cast overall. Either they died to quickly and you couldn't connect with them or they disappeared after having 5minutes to give their quick how do you do. One other thing that I didn't really care for was the ending. It ended a lot like the book The Giver, where it seemingly appears to be okay but you aren't quite sure. Maybe that boat was run by the govt? Maybe it was the \"fishies\" or whatever they were called? Who knows. I would have preferred a bit more of a definitive ending, and not exactly a happy one at that. Something that felt more real to the film, Overall it was good, not great.

This screen play, written by Timothy J. Sexton and director Alfonso Cuaron (Based off the novel of the same name by P.D. James) draws you into the film and straps you in your chair for  almost a 2 hr. ride without letting up, leaving you wanting, no begging for more. Its so well rounded and worked out and was truly a breath of fresh air within the Sci-Fi Genre. With the well rounded cast and the near perfect script, the best thing for me that stood out most was the director. Cuaron perfectly planned out ever scene, with his beautiful use of long continuous shots and wide camera angles, its visually stunning and so very impressive to watch, the reverse car chase scene alone was brilliant, let alone that fantastic continuous shot at the climax of the film. if your big into cinematography and love a beautifully crafted science Fiction drama, and haven't seen Children of Men yet, i suggest you waste no more time and watch it immediately. yes its that damn good.",

There's no tension, no obstacles to overcome - basically the Italian Job of \"sci-fi.\"\r\n\r\nTechnical problems: the action one-take follow shot is great for war scenes, but not for a conversational scene. Shooting an entire movie in this look is disorienting and annoying. Sound design was atrocious as well, with every character having a crystal clear voice, despite being outdoors or in an echo-y corridor.\r\n\r\nActing by Clive Owen was very mechanical and emotionless. He was a reluctant hero, but had a permanent look of \"What, where am I?\" on his face. The rest of the cast was poorly developed, which really made me care very little when they were taken out of the storyline.\r\n\r\nWith my griping out of the way, let me touch on the good. The locations were beautifully gritty. All of the abandoned buildings and the refugee camp footage was very well put together. There was some good humor that broke up the film a bit and made it not so tedious to watch. Some good action sequences in there as well, and a bit of brutal violence that surprised me a little.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a film with a lot of potential that fell far short. It's hardly a sci-fi film, and its attempts to be artistic made it frustrating to watch.",

A completely \"other\" England which I was amazed to see realised in such detail. Clive Owen FINALLY has the heroic role we have been waiting for and is brilliant in it. Julianne Moore simply glows and I've never enjoyed Sir Michael Caine so much before. The soundtrack is beautifully eclectic. Aside from some excellent classical choices, there's an evocative and alternative Spanish take on \"Ruby Tuesday\" which is a signature on the film. Wait during the end titles to enjoy an excremental song from Jarvis Cocker.\r\n\r\nThe movie grabbed my attention right from the start, and never let go. Initially, it's the differences of this future world that intrigue. Then, when the action starts, what I found really surprising was the freshness of direction that made me react to bullets and violence as if I'd never seen them in a movie before. If the script wasn't so wonderfully leavened with wit, it would be a grim and scary movie at times.\r\n\r\nFinally, the whole thing is lit brilliantly, from the authentic dim English days to the atmospheric ending.\r\n\r\nOne to watch alongside \"The Handmaid's Tale\" some time....",

It then follows it up by asking if a child, who could end the dry spell of fertility, was born, would it be put to use for the wrong reasons.

Though it has great effects, it doesn't take over the story. Story comes first and not many sci-fi films can do that anymore. Something I noticed in this film was the large number of animals that are present. In every other scene, animals control a shot. I like to think they symbolize life (as it's been shown people with pets live longer with animal companion). The film is also filed with even more symbolism (the main character's name is Theo which means God). These symbolic moments really shine through beside it's human character's and story. Together, they make the film work. It's one of the best sci-fi films of the past couple years. Truely one of the best of the 2000's.",

            "content": "Alfonso Cuaron's \"Children Of Men\" takes place in the not-too-distant-future where every woman is infertile and world order is on the brink of collapse. Theo Faron (Owen), a conflicted diplomat, is kidnapped by his ex-wife and revolutionary (Moore) to escort a refugee to freedom. However, what Theo doesn't know is that this refugee is in fact a pregnant woman. Thus, a epic and provocative quest ensues.  In this world nearly every country's government has fallen. Therefore, as the only nation left standing, the U.K. must deal with millions of illegal immigrants trying to take refuge within their country. This prompts the U.K. drop into a militarized police state where violence and death are commonplace. Interesting enough, what I enjoyed most about this movie was the atmosphere. The world in \"Children Of Men\" is so disquieting, and so scary. You can tell that the art directors really took an extensive amount of time to make this setting look as dreary as it's supposed to be. The setting's bleakness is accentuated with really appropriate lighting. However, the cinematography also offers some really beautiful shots of the ravaged U.K. The screenplay is really well written, and it is performed equally as well. Clive Owen really shines in this roles, and Michael Caine plays a character that has a bundle of hilarious lines. Another aspect of this film that I admired is the fact that Cuaron utilized single-shot. This means that when the crap hits the fan for Clive Owen and Co. the cameras never stop rolling and the whole sequence is filmed in one single take. Which brings me to another aspect of \"Children Of Men\" that I enjoyed - the final sequence of the film. This film's final sequence used the aforementioned action scene technique and it also features a really interesting yet spoilerish dynamic that I can't share. You'll just have to watch it yourself. Overall I felt that \"Children Of Men\" was an awesome piece of speculative fiction that effectively serves as a cautionary tale for everyone to take seriously.",

The camera style feels like you're in the middle of the action, as if filmed by a war correspondent, giving the film a gritty and raw feel. Except on one occasion the camera work breaks the 4th wall, which detracts from the story. The complexity of themes are harsh and evocative, managing to evoke issues of race, class, concentration camps, terrorism, and wars in the Middle east etc. However the heavy handed references to Christian mythology are grating and obvious, glorifying the notion of birth and creation as well as cementing the archetype of \"man, woman and child\" and while it does adapt and change elements it reverts much to the traditional stereotypes in a disappointing way. Overall a powerful and evocative film, with great performances, but is overlaid with mythical and spiritual themes.",

I have only just finished watching this film but it has instantly jumped up to number 3 on my top 50 list and I can confidently say without a doubt that this is the best film since Toy Story and easily the best film of the decade. This is the first film of directors Alfonso Cauron which I have seen but his filmmaking technique is incredible, there are very few directors who can make a film that manages to combine so many different genres and sophisticated political and social messages into one 2 hour film.\r\nThe premise of children of men does seem to appear to be the usual end of the world crap on the face of it but the threat which the human race faces seems much more real and foreboding than the threat of a Zombie Apocalypse, Nuclear Fallout or a gigantic barrage of meteorites. I have also done some research about infertility rates and read a few articles online and creepily enough I have discovered that infertility rates are rising and it is very creepy to think that the film I just watched is not that far from fiction. \r\nThis film also perfectly captures the desperation and hope which humanity shows in situations of chaos. I can perfectly see the events of this film happening in real life and it makes me worry about the destructive nature of man and just how desperate we could become.\r\nClive Owen puts on an amazing performance as Theo, a broken man with a big heart, Every action which he performed felt utterly believable and the film didn't depict him as an indestructible action hero who can kill, just as simply as clicking his fingers. He just seems as an ordinary person who has normal morale conflicts just like everybody else. His character is utterly thought provoking because like other characters like 'The Man with No Name', we know very little about his past, and only occasionally do we learn about his past, and I really feel sympathy for him.\r\nAll the supporting cast are excellent as well, although Julianne Moore's character is only in the film for around 10 - 20 minutes she plays a vital role in the narrative and provides a good and vital motivation for Theo throughout the film. Michael Caine also shows why he is one of the best actors of all time, his actor provides hints of comedy to the film and perfectly captures that  however desperate humanity gets, there will always be those who try and bring joy to the world, even in dark moments involving him in the film, he still managed to bring a smile to my face. Everyone else throughout the film gives great and believable performances as well.\r\nMy favourite part of the film however is the single shot sequences, I have again researched and some of these sequences are around 400 seconds long and they all make the film feels more immersive and involving, very few films manage to do this film without feeling like a documentary or being based on actual events.\r\n (SPOILER ALERT START))The film also never lingers too much on any certain events, a prime example being when the first baby for around  18 years is born, it is obviously a very important moment for everyone because humanity had basically given up hope for itself or its survival and had just presumed that it would eventually destroy itself. The moment holds much religious connotation and provides many important messages such as hope for humanity and faith in your fellow man. The few minutes of the film which are basically silent, and all that happens that everyone, the freedom fighters,  the fugees and the army all stop and embrace what may be the last shimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak existence. But then the fighting starts again showing that that mankind will always revert back to its usual, violent existence.  (SPOILER ALERT ENDS)\r\nI am not going to give anything away about the ending but there are many possible reactions you could have, you may cry, weep, smile, laugh, pretty much anything. But you must watch the whole film and embrace it for what it is.\r\nBasically, this film cannot be specifically assigned to any one  particular genre, but this is a must see and I really hope that it is as thought provoking and enjoyable as I found it, absolutely breathtaking cinema.",

Alfonso Cuaron has me convinced that he's one of, if not the, best in the business, period. The high caliber of storytelling is seemingly automatic with him, and I mean that in the most gracious way. And the significance of hope, a commonly used v. Children of Men, Cuaron's ultimate fusion of puzzlingly powerful set-pieces, admonishing visions, and believable characters has me thoroughly invigorated and relieved that someone in Hollywood is still capable of producing quality stories.",

It is a triumph for Alfonso Cuaron, both in terms of concept and in terms of execution.\n\nThe film deals with the dystopian, near-apocalyptic Britain of 2027. Human females have been infertile for 18 years and the British government has adopted a zero tolerance policy on the hordes of illegal immigrants that are flooding into the country.\n\nThat is the horrid sounding vision that this film provides of our future. The entire film forces you to consider the potential perils of pollution, global warming and various acts of man that could bring about this horrific apocalypse. The dangerous, militant Britain that Children of Men portrays really grabs you by the throat and the brutal violence that humanity resorts to lets you into the bare, naked survival-of-the-fittest culture that this society brings.\n\nVisually, the film is perfect. Cuaron's direction portrays the hopelessness of Britain in exactly the right way and the lengthy, single-shot action sequences communicate the brutality of what is essentially an all-out war without the stylised jump cutting of Hollywood action blockbusters.\n\nThe film does suffer a little from how it drifts away from its political subtext towards the end and seems to become reminiscent of a Call of Duty game, but the ending provides just the right amount of hope and provides a thought-provoking ending to the kind of film that you'll still be thinking about days later.",

But after the first action sequence, the film flat-out lost great potential. The film adopted a simple plot, which was basically going to different places, meeting a person who will help the protagonists, and then repeat until the end. \r\nNow, there's nothing wrong with a simple plot, but this film had the potential of something much better than that. Character development became no longer necessary when it was \"meet n' try to get hell out of here.\" And to me it was obvious that most of the characters were going to die. The film subtly became predictable.  \r\nDespite that, I don't find this film to be a \"bad movie\" for three reasons. 1) I found the futuristic setting to be original and realistic unlike other sci-fi future films that force flying cars and what--not. 2) the film has one of the best camerawork I have ever seen, the action sequences were well-made. And 3) Clive Owen's character was very convincing and well-acted; he's was like a modern Winston (reference to the book 1984 for those who don't know). \r\nIt's a shame the plot took a lazy route. I don't see why this film received so much praise It's clearly just a decent film, at least for me. \r\nI will watch it again some time but I doubt my opinion will drastically change.\r\n3/4 B-",

            "content": "I was flicking channels before bed time the other night when I came across this film, it had only just started but I thought I'd watch five minutes... Fifteen minutes later I pressed 'Record' and retired to bed. I'm really glad I recorded it now because, I have to say for the record that I have seen it before but first time around I didn't enjoy it all that much. A second viewing has convinced me that it is a very fine piece of work, gritty, and tough to watch at times, but certainly worth it. More of my thoughts later but here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please escort that refugee to the coast while I write the next paragraph).\r\n\r\nIt is the year 2027 and the world has gone to pot. No babies have been born since 2009 and this has caused chaos across the globe as society collapsed leaving numerous homeless and destitute people. Many make their way to the UK where they are herded into cages and sent to camps far away from the population. When an English man, Theo Faron is approached by his former lover, and leader of a pro-refugee rebellion, Julian, he reluctantly agrees to help her. They need him to escort a girl, Kee, to the coast where they hope to get her on a boat to meet a group of scientists known as 'The Human Project'. Having secured the paperwork from his brother, Theo meets up with Julian, Kee and Miriam (Kee's escort). They set off but are ambushed; they get away and make it to a safe house that proves not to be quite as safe as first thought. Here Theo discovers what is so special about Kee and why it is so important for everyone that she makes it to her destination. I'll leave it there so as not to infuriate the spoiler police... they can get quite nasty you know.\r\n\r\nFilmed in a washed-out style, this film is very stark-looking with a realistic feel to it. This really helps the story, which is a no-holds-barred assault on the sensitivities of modern life. It really hits home in a very pragmatic way how society could end up if mankind lets it (ok, no more political stuff). Great performances all round, particularly from Clive Owen as Theo Faron, he seldom convinces me as a leading man, but as the reluctant hero here, he really nails it. Julianne Moore did a good job as Julian (daft name for a girl if you ask me though), as did Pam Ferris as Miriam. I really liked Clare-Hope Ashitey as Kee, she played a difficult part very well, and it was great to see Michael Caine as you've never seen him before, as Theo's friend Jasper.\r\n\r\nAmongst all the grit, dirt and general reality of the film comes one scene that will stay with me for a long time. For those that have seen it, it's where Theo and Kee are leaving the tower block and all the fighting stops until they are clear (I don't think I've given anything vital away here). If you haven't seen it, believe me, it's a truly beautiful piece of cinema. There is also a great soundtrack with many songs you'll recognise and a great piece of humour for Pink Floyd fans... just look out of the window at Battersea Power station & you'll see what I mean. Over all, I really enjoyed this film, although I did find it a little too long. There are some great performances and it is a very compelling story... Recommended.\r\n\r\nMy score: 8.0/10\r\n\r\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos, links and bigger print) on my blog at:\r\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.com/2011/03/film-review-children-of-men-2006.html\r\n\r\nEnjoy!... :)",

I will say that it was very well done and had superb acting.  The film had been talked up a lot so my expectations were high\u00e2?\u00a6again it wasn\u00e2??t a bad film but it didn\u00e2??t change my life or make me want to tell everyone to go see it.  There were quite a few slow blocks and some of the interior story was hard to follow\u00e2?\u00a6the overall story line however was super clever and very interesting to me.  The idea of the \u00e2??end of humanity\u00e2?? with no major natural disasters or zombie attacks is gripping in itself.  In fact it was eerie how real it all felt\u00e2?\u00a6the feeling of desperation was portrayed perfectly.\n\nMy jury is still out on Clive Owen.  He was great in this but something always seems to bug me a little bit about him.  I\u00e2??d say he\u00e2??s solid but doesn\u00e2??t entice me to see more his movies.  As good as he was, it really wasn\u00e2??t a \u00e2??break out\u00e2?? role for Mr. Owen just as I said a moment ago, solid.  Both Julianne Moore and Michael Caine were excellent in their respective roles\u00e2?\u00a6I can honestly say I\u00e2??ve never been disappointed with Michael Caine.\n\nIf you just LOVED \u00e2??Children of Men\u00e2?? I get it and understand why though our opinions differ a bit.  If you hated it or just weren\u00e2??t crazy about it, I as well understand but I find myself somewhere in between.  I guess I would recommend it just for the shear creatively of the film and because I feel it evokes good conversation.",

The story is taken from PD James' novel of the same name where women all over the world have become infertile. There are plenty of science fiction films that tell the opposite story of overpopulation so this concept was unique (at least for me). This film doesn't explain why it happens and it doesn't need to because that's not what the film is about. It's about the impending doom that humans have to face only this time it takes its sweet time. \nThe characters in the film are hopeless for a change, so when we're shown the full belly of immigrant Kee, the reactions from the main characters breaks that drought of hope and instills determination to take her to safety from chaotic England. \nThere isn't much of a original score to the film, but it's better off without one: there are moments where it stays silent, but the tension between characters is felt throughout the room.\nI suppose I should keep this review short, so in conclusion, this is the Blade Runner of the 21st Century. This will be the movie that will attract a cult following in the coming years (and it has already started to form).",

It's a suttle and weird concept of a story, but Children of Men is far from suttle.\r\n\r\nClive Owen stars as Leo, a man who is stuck between a war ravenged world and a hard place. As he becomes forcably involved with scientist activists fighting for rights for immigrants, who have become treated like the plague in Britain. But there's a conflict: the activists are holding an immigrant woman who is pregnant. This future is a scary one. The world is fighting with eachother, soldiers parade the streets, and if the cities aren't civil enough, outside the city is a constant fight for survival. This is a very interesting concept of a story, and it's great because it views the entire aspect of society and how the situation affects everyone.\r\n\r\nAlfonso Cuaron, my hat goes off to you. This film remains thuroughly captivating and breathtaking because of how this movie creates this war stricken world. A competely different look of society is created, and it doesn't even look that impossible. Filmed with almost entirely natural light, there aren't a lot of special gimmics in this movie. This movie looks like you're right into the movie and experience. The camera flows like you're right beside the characters in this very dark enviroment. But what's most impressive are the continuous, one-shot takes. Simplistic in it's way, but extremely hard to do. How the director was able to capture shots like these are mindblowing to me. It's something you have to see for yourself, but an excelent job achieved by the camera man and the actors and crew who were able to achieve these mindblowing shots.\r\n\r\nIt's not really a political message movie, nor is it a simplistic view of the world. This is an examination of society and how easily the world can fall apart. But is it because no one can give birth, or was the world already like this? Children of Men is an interesting concept done incredably well. The directing choices and singular takes really bring you into the movie and it's hard to shake off afterwards.",

Although it got high praise from critics, most people have seemed to pass this movie up and not notice it, probably because of it's plot.\n\nI'll first start off saying I'm not a big fan of these sort of movies that are set in the future. However, this was a very original film that looks like it's in the present, abandoning all those heavy sci-fi effects and stories.\n\nThis film deals with a man who returns to the activism fold, and is forced to do a very risky duty, on behalf of his ex-wife Julian. Once he sees what he has to accomplish, he has no choice but to do it. This is for a pregnant woman's safety, so he promises her he'll get her out of harms way so she can deliver her baby. Is he able to get her to safety's way, or will they be in great danger?\n\nAlthough some call it a sci-fi film, I highly recommend this to any drama or thriller fan who is not afraid to see something different.

It seems easy right?  Wrong it is in the future when the world is completely different.  It focuses on the 2 main characters in my opinion and that is Theo and Kee.  This movie not only has a solid story, it also is jammed packed with action.  There is one scene where there was honestly at least 4 minutes straight of just explosions and guns firing.  It really helps show how the world can turn out.  It is kind of scary.  But I am still amazed at how good this movie was.  I mean I bought this expecting it to be good because of all its high ratings but I never expected it to have to many WTF moments.

The cinematography is gorgeous and there is numerous long shots that are just gracefully amazing. There are several plot holes but can be disregarded later on as irrelevant. The acting is good and standard. There are a lot of unnecessary moments that really serve no purpose to the story.

This film is more of a thinking man's science fiction and is very well done. Alfonso Cuaron (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) brings this very dark tale to the screen based on the novel by P.D. James. Clive Owen portrays Theo, a man who has to safely take a young woman to a group of people, where her baby can safely be born. The point of the film is that we are in the year 2027 and a single baby hasn't been born.\r\n\r\nJulianne Moore portrays Owen's former love interest and a resistance leader who asks Owen to his help her. Michael Caine lends a terrific supporting performance as an old friend of Owen's and a sort of hippie of the future who smokes weed and cares for his catatonic wife. Caine lends a funny role to this dark film. Cuaron's direction is breathtaking, with a few scenes actually being single takes which are spectacular. The choice of music is also well done, with the only original score being Fragments of a Prayer by John Tavener, a haunting prayer-like piece. The film is indeed sad and scary, while it proves that Cuaron is indeed a master filmmaker who can affect many audiences.",

Cuaron uses this bleak world view to explore contemporary themes of terrorism, illegal immigration and environmental destruction. There are extraordinary sequences such as a 360 degree panning shot from the interior of an automobile in motion. A road picture that turns into a war movie, this is a nightmarish vision of Hell comparable to Godard's \"Weekend.\" (A mural of Picasso's \"Guernica\" can be glimpsed in one sequence.)

This particular film excels in every category. It is shot beautifully(the cinematography in two specific scenes is amazing: car chase, walking through the war), the acting is just perfect and the mood the movie sets makes you feel uneasy, but in a good way. The movie at times makes you believe the scenes are in fact real, and that is what I mean by suspension of disbelief. As the end credits rolled I couldn't help but feel chills going down my back. What else could you ask for of a movie? It is a shame the movie didn't catch on that much, as I feel it is vastly underrated by both critics and potential viewers.",

In fact the opening scene chillingly and brilliantly shows that terrorism and violence is a constant risk. Chaos reigns for much of the city and indeed most major capitals across the world, as refugees from even poorer and more unfortunate locations are constantly rounded up to be shipped to internment camps.\r\n\r\nIn short it seems that there are clear divisions in the populations, respectable and non-respectable, and you don't want to be in the class with the prefix.\r\n\r\nAmong all this chaos is Theo, played by Clive Owen, a slightly apathetic everyman seemingly doomed to a life of mediocrity. Theo takes the news of Baby Diego's demise as an excuse to chuck a sickie and visit his hippie-ish friend Jasper, who lives with his catatonic wife in isolation in the middle of nowhere.\r\n\r\nJasper seems to live his life by T-shirt slogans such as \"Relax\", \"Sh*t Happens\" and \"Don't Worry Be Happy\". When all else fails he simply rolls a big joint and takes a temporary exit from existence.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to London Theo is almost immediately abducted in broad (muggy English) daylight on the street, upon setting eyes upon his captor he is amazed to see his ex-wife Julian, who has been on the wanted list for some time due to her dodgy activities and associates.\r\n\r\nJulian needs help smuggling a refugee out of the country, she hopes that Theo can provide the required papers to facilitate the move. Not wanting to risk his skin Theo initially says no thanks, however once released he approaches his more privileged and connected cousin for the papers, in a scene that reminded me an awful lot of Blade Runner.\r\n\r\nNow armed with the documents Theo once again makes contact and says that he will help on one proviso, that he is allowed to tag along.\r\n\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nTheo meets the girl named Kee (wink-wink) and her nanny/minder Miriam and they set off with Julian in tow, and this is where the movie elevates itself above most other movies of the last decade.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that Kee is pregnant, remember that hasn't happened for some 18 odd years, so Theo is understandably shocked. The film doesn't try to explain how or what it means, only that it is very important.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that someone was actually able to conceive has been kept top secret, some want to use the information for political means, others more symbolic, and still others want to terminate the \"problem\".\r\n\r\nJulian represents an underground group who wish to deliver Kee to a mysterious organization known as the \"Human Project\" so that she might be protected and studied, so that an answer might be sought.\r\n\r\nOf course everything goes pear shaped when the car they are traveling in is ambushed and Julian is killed, meaning Theo must decide which side he is on and where to go from here.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe rest of the film follows Theo and Kee, who has decided he is the only one she trusts, as they attempt to reach a rondezvous with the Human Project.\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers show no favourites, seemingly important characters are killed off, no-one can be trusted, and violence is unfortunately everywhere, something shown in this film in occasionally graphic detail.\r\n\r\nThere are some absolutely brilliant set pieces shown in apparently unbroken real time with one camera, these scenes seamlessly blend in long sequences, intricate dialogue and action and stunts, and they are truly awesome.\r\n\r\nThere is not so much a finale as there is an ending, if that makes sense?, as everything seems to continue building as the film progresses. If there was a finale though, it would happen in a refugee camp, where violence is even more prevalent, chaos reigns and the fact that most of the internees are foreigners results in more confusion for Theo and Kee as they continue onwards.\r\n\r\nI don't know much about acting but this all look top notch to me, especially Clive Owen who I have a bit of a man crush on. The film is brilliantly paced and visually striking from beginning to end, and the action is incredibly realistic and therefore has more impact than your standard \"bang-bang, you're dead\" stuff.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen many films that were as original as this, nor have I seen a film that remained with me for as long after the credits rolled.\r\n\r\nThis is a great film.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 9 / 10. Incredible stuff. Watch it.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",

            "content": "There's something odd about a film that you can skip 20 minutes of at a time, and yet still take away exactly the same type of experience. That's where I'm sitting at with Children of Men. I originally watched this film in an English class, skipping through many parts, and only watching about 30 minutes of the actual film. Now that I've gotten the chance to see the entire film, I can't say that there was much point to it.\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that the film is terrible, in fact, far from it. It just doesn't really require a proper viewing, and if you were to cut out parts of the story that don't really improve the overall story of the film, you would be left with something resembling a 30-40 minute film. A really well-shot, decently acted 30-40 minute film, but that's still what it would be. There isn't much reason to have made Children of Men a full length film, as it just doesn't need that kind of running time to make its impact.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place in the future. The women of the planet have become infertile, which somehow manages to make the world fall into complete chaos. Britain is the only place left on Earth that managed to stay as a decent place to live, and as such, immigration has become a problem. The film revolves around Theo Faron (Clive Owen), who gets convinced to help women (Claire-Hope Ashitey) find safe transit out of London. It turns out that this women is pregnant, the first pregnant women in 18 years. A group of people want to use this child as a signal of hope to rally the people. Here lies the main problem the film has.\r\n\r\nThe story doesn't require long to tell at all. There are many events that occur that don't end up meaning anything by the end, with some characters coming and going without much purpose. It was especially disappointing to see Michael Caine's character show up, disappear for a large amount of time, then reappear only to disappear again quickly after. It's especially sad when his character is not only one of the more important supporting characters, one of an aging hippie, but also the most interesting character in the film.\r\n\r\nThere is also a problem with the premise itself. The still-unborn child is supposed to represent hope. Things can improve, preaches the film. That doesn't make any sense. One pregnant woman doesn't symbolize hope for the entire planet! All it does is say that there might be a slight chance that the unexplained infertility crisis may be over. The rest of the planet is still in ruins. We are shown this near the beginning. Nowhere else is really even livable anymore. Even if this birth-to-be means that the human race is coming out of this problem, there are still far too many other ones we would have to deal with. Riots, overpopulation, resource depletion, and not to mention the inevitable global warming that comes from many of these things.\r\n\r\nWhat's most surprising about this film is the fact that the superfluous parts that could easily be cut out manage to still be interesting. They're unnecessary, sure, but that doesn't necessarily render them useless. There are times in which the story can really draw you in, and while it these plot points make no impact on the final result of the film, they manage to entertain, if nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe best thing that Children of Men has going for it is its cinematography. Unlike many science fiction films, the special effects don't carry it. This is refreshing, and allows the viewer to focus on the scenery and the way things are shot, rather than things like CGI monsters. There are many single-shot sequences used in the film, ones that really manage to stand out. They're quite beautiful to look at, and while I'm sure they were tough to film, they end up being the highlights of the film.\r\n\r\nThe other thing the film has going for it is its acting. While the lead performance of Clive Owen didn't resonate with me well, the supporting cast managed to make up for it. Michael Caine and Clare-Hope Ashitey were especially good in their roles, and they made us care for them and their situations. Clive Owen, however, felt hollow as the lead, and while this may be intentional given that his character didn't appear to care much for the world, it was off-putting.\r\n\r\nChildren of Men felt like a short film that had to fill up an hour and a half running time. It had many plot points that didn't go anywhere, and while these parts are interesting, connecting them to the rest of the story certainly would have been appreciated. The premise seemed quite silly to me, not really making a lot of sense. The acting was overall decent, and the film was shot beautifully. It just doesn't always come together properly into a cohesive picture. It manages to stay entertaining for the majority of its running time, but it doesn't amount to much by the end.",

When the character walks, the camera \"walks\", when the character is still, the camera is still. In the end of the day, that's what gives the viewer the sense of reality. The soundtrack was chosen well also. Every actor did well, but nothing extraordinary. Not surprised to see Danny Huston in this one either, since he's in like 20 movies in last 5 years and in like another 40 British movies in the same period of time. He's literally EVERYWHERE. Not that I like him because of that. Clive Owen was reasonably good, so a really good and enjoyable movie overall",

I am very open minded with films, but I couldn't get past the premise. \r\n\r\nFirstly, all women are infertile by 2009, every woman in every crevice of the world.  That means a genetic shift in the space of a few years when genetics are obsessed with survival of the species and it takes 100,000 years for something large to change genetically. \r\n\r\nThen we have the state of society. I do have grievances with the current world, corrupt capitalism and so on. I am well aware that the oil and pharmaceutical lobbies fund the elections and then control policy, education and certification screwing the ordinary taxpayer all sides in the process. \r\n\r\nBUT it is at least as progression, an indirect sodomy as opposed to the direct forms of the past. This film expects us to believe that we could in the space of a decade go back to a banana republic, concentration type camps, gross and very public abuses of human rights and all that goes with it, in established 'progressive' (if very slow to progress and still largely unfree/stratified) democratic countries such as Britain.\r\n\r\nEven in the worst of times for 70 years, such as we've had, in relative terms even the 80's were worse than now. The worst of this has been another unnecessary costly war and high unemployment. Not pleasant, but not the disintigration of society.\r\n\r\nThe story is just way too much of a stretch. I suppose if they had even tried to somewhat plausibly address why these things could conceivably happen then maybe those questions would have left my mind and I could have gotten into the film.  But I couldn't. It was far too much to let slide. So big thumbs down for me.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is semi-watchable because it is fast moving with lots of good action and you do kind of want to see what will happen in the end.",

But then when I heard how good it was ( It was 2nd ranked by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as one of the best movies of the last decade) I thought 'Yeah I should give it a try. Let's see how it is'.\r\n\r\nChildren Of Men takes place in 2027 and it has been 18 years since the last child was born. Now he then got killed and London bureaucrat Theo (Clive Owen) seems to cared since he used to be an activist for an unknown cause. Now, England is being controlled by British police and the government turns totalitarian with its policies on illegal immigrants. The immigrants also known as Fugees come in great numbers to England. Not only that, all of the world women's are infertile so there were no kids born between 2009 and the year the film is set.\r\n\r\nTheo is asked by his ex-girlfriend Julian (Julianne Moore), the leader of The Fishes, an anti government organisation with a set of beliefs on human rights, to help an African refugee Kee to escape from England to the Human Project so she can be able to look after her unborn baby. Julian is killed afterwards and when Theo discovers that the Fishes' were responsible for Julian's death, he decided to bring Kee along with Fishes member Miriam themselves to a boat.\r\n\r\nChildren Of Men looks similar, in a way, to District 9 released last year. They're both set in the future and it's kinda has the same concept. Both have issues with immigration and racism. Even though District 9 focused on aliens, Children Of Men focused on humans and it is anything apart from science fiction.\r\n\r\nThe movie's cinematography and direction from Alfonso Cuaron (he directed Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkerban) is so gritty with an idealistic screenplay from Timothy J Sexton.\r\n\r\nClive Owen brings in subtlety towards his character. You would want to care for him as well as the pregnant Kee. Julianne Moore puts in a nice performance as well as Michael Caine who suprisingly plays a hippie with his posh accent.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Cuaron has the camera around in one take making it one scene held for a long time while things are still happening. This takes the film into and around the edge even when the film is put as an experiment. But unless you can handle it while watching, you're more likely to get sick because many scenes are shot hand held.\r\n\r\nCuaron takes the plot into more ideas as we predict of facing a crisis on illegal immigrants and infertility. One thing is that when Kee gave birth, the baby is a symbolism of hope during one scene where the Fishes and the British military are in conflict. This also takes up rebellion, as the Fishes show how violent activists are when are taking on the government over issues affecting them.\r\n\r\nWhen Australia is facing a problem with our overpopulation, and just recently a Chinese dissentant who is a human rights activist is awarded the Nobel Peace Price, Children Of Men's main focus is human rights. Whenever you look in the background you see guards treating migrants as dirt and mostly putting them to death and it promotes this awareness through the mass media as you'll see slogans such as 'Report Illegal Immigrants' everywhere.\r\n\r\nSo is Children Of Men is as perfect as it should be? Quite not. I think it would have been better if Julianne Moore (I have to admit, I never seen her in film before) and Michael Caine had more screen time instead of just dying. That would have been character development had their characters never been killed. And it would have made sense of the plot has a background of how the world problems occured.\r\n\r\nChildren of Men is a futuristic movie with a difference. It is all about to keep the survival of a person holding the key of the endangered human race. To say that a science fiction needs ideas to keep us entertained can be an exagerration, but Children Of Men is one of those movies in the genres that has many ideas that will keep us in grips.",

Societies worldwide have collapsed after no children have been born in almost two decades, and the survivors of the ensuing wars, atrocities and civil breakdowns flee to Britain, which still functions under a harsh regime. The last young person has just died. Theo, a former activist now working as a paper-pusher in the Ministry of Energy must help and protect a pregnant woman to get to the East coast in order to get onboard a ship which will take care of her and her baby. \n\nI loved this movie. I wasn't quite expecting it to be so good and went into it knowing extremely little about it which is probably how it actually should be viewed. There aren't any flaws at all. The acting is brilliant -Clive Owen gives what I think is his best performance and Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetal Ejiofor, and Pam Ferris are all superb in support, while the young Claire-Hope Ashitay is also impressive as Kee. The movie is of a genre done before, yet feels fresh, from the scripting to the look of the movie. There are some genuine shocks in store. Thanks to Alfonso Cuaran's fantastic camera-work, the violence becomes more brutal, the acting more powerful and the shocks are so realistic that you frequently feel as though you're watching real footage. Scenes such as the drive through the forest look so real that they are excruciatingly tense and absolutely terrifying to watch. Children Of Men is surely a landmark in cinema, and will certainly gain in reputation as the years go by.",

If you think this you are not so far from the reality .However you cannot be more far from it as this movie is not a religious attempt to describe a future but rather a pragmatic and touching statement of what our humanity Could become by the choice we are making now.What will happen if we continue to use OGM or disgusting food and dangerous drugs like we do it today??.IS it actually actually worth it?This movie really succeed by questioning our values and morality on those subjects that underline the tale of this story .The movie gives us an answer :we could merely destroy ourself and without being able to protect life and to value it we will surely be destroyed.Yes!we can definitely say that this movie is a philosophical one and therefore a religious one since it questions our humanity...but it does it without being preachy and by only telling a beautiful story.That is why it is so relevant.This is a classic and definitely one of the best science fiction movie of the last ten years.I Love It and recommend it to everyone from 6 years old children to 96 old men.Amen!",

Children of Men, however, is the real deal, a proper, no-nonsense, 109-minute downer-fest of impossible bleakness. It's set in 2027 London, 25 years after the Last Baby Ever was born--and the fact that humanity is seemingly doomed to go extinct through mere sterility has brought about all kinds of nasty shit. There is a (very) faint glimmer of hope for the world at the end, and Michael Caine's ageing hippy character provides some humour, but overall I think that The Darkness prevails. Clive Owen's permanently sullen expression does little to help, as the fact that the movie takes itself a tad too seriously.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Children of Men is formally brilliant. For one thing, it's really cool how the whole \"future\" element is subtly downplayed. Most importantly, however, there are at least three lengthy and wonderfully complex single-shot sequences, the mere thought of which fills me with admiration and longing to see the movie again.",

Children of Men happens to be one of the best and most thought-provoking (I know, that term gets thrown around a lot) sci-fi movies I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe year is 2027, and it has been eighteen years since the last child was born. The world has been thrown into chaos by this plague of infertility and every country, save Britain, has collapsed, and Britain isn't far off. Theo, played by Clive Owen, is contacted by his rebel wife to escort a refugee out of the country. Things get complicated and after a violent and narrow escape, Theo discovers that this isn't any normal \"fugee\":  she's pregnant. His struggle then becomes to keep her away from both the government and the rebel cell, who wishes to use the baby to spur a rebellion.\r\n\r\nI just don't even know where to begin with Children of Men. How about the performances? The entire cast is spectacular. Clive Owen has his best role yet in a movie and he plays this character just right. Julianne Moore is superb, and my only complaint is that she isn't in the movie long enough. Michael Caine absolutely steals every scene he's in, giving possibly the only comic relief in this entire movie. If you want a reason why he's one of my favorite actors, watch this movie.\r\n\r\nThe story is excellent as well. I've never wondered what would happen if people just stopped giving birth, but the effects are beautifully realized here. The film has an overall depressing and gloomy tone, but the ending was so beautiful and positive (I think I may have cried when at the beginning of the credits, and I think you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Several scenes are just beautiful, particularly a one in a building where a battle is raging, and the sound of this baby crying causes every soldier and civilian to stop and gaze in awe. There's no music or dialogue, just the sound of the baby crying and the peoples' reactions. It's captivating.\r\n\r\nCamerawork doesn't usually get mention in my reviews, but it's well worth noting here. It's simply impressive. It's shot in a shaky-cam style (more Bourne than Blair Witch), but never impedes the view of the action as in the previously mentioned films. Also there are numerous tracking shots that span about five to ten minutes with no edits or anything, and you don't even realize it until it's over. One particular scene takes place completely from the perspective of inside the car as the passengers go from trading stories and jokes to being scared for their lives as the vehicle is attacked.\r\n\r\nChildren of Men is a brilliantly realized film. Just every part of the film is amazing and it deserves attention. It's definitely has one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen in a movie. It goes down in my book as one of the best examples of \"thinking-man's\" sci-fi without overdoing it, and one of my favorites.",

With long, continuous, unedited shots, Cuaron makes moviegoers fellow journeymen on this war-torn sojourn, building on the emotion and tension of being a character in-the-moment over an extended period of time. The audience feels the debris from a blown-apart building. The audience jumps in their seats when refugees throw bottles. The audience feels the war-torn world fall into a hush when a baby\u0092s cry is heard.

The idea is so terrifying because it isn't that difficult of a thing to imagine. And it's not pure science fiction; everyone knows that there is infertility in the world - imagine if it became epidemic!\r\n\r\nThe principle characters were solid, well written and acted, and highly believable as the two most unlikely heroes. Instead of a macho gun-toting action star, Clive's character is wholly unprepared for the trials he faces and the enormous job of protecting humanity's last hope. And in his flaws and reluctance and weakness is his believability. The mother's character was also very well done as the archetypal Madonna presented in an entirely unusual and unexpected way. This woman was perfect and yet completely unprepared for the role of 'mother of the future'. Together, they carried the film very well, and it is their characters that I will remember the most.\r\n\r\nTwo things I didn't like: \r\n\r\nParts of it were downright boring. Parts of it didn't make much sense within the context of the larger film (mostly at the beginning), and parts of it just seemed superfluous or there merely for shock value. There was too much going on outside of the core plot that it seemed to take away from the main quest to get the mother and baby to safety. \r\n\r\nThe political commentary about the treatment of outsiders and immigrants was compelling, but could have played a slightly lesser role. As it was, I felt that this sub-story completely overwhelmed the main plot and only led to confusion and frustration. It was as if the writers were trying to squeeze ten hours worth of story into a two hour film. By taking on too many sub-plots, none of them were explained very well and they all got in the way of each other.\r\n\r\nMy other problem was the ending. I didn't like it. It was downright anticlimactic, and it didn't provide any sense of closure at all. After all that had happened, I expected more. \r\n\r\nA good story, a fantastic and downright frightening premise, but as a movie could have been better executed.",

            "content": "Perhaps the only film I can think of where the premise is pretty silly but the execution is brilliant. This is an unexpected masterpiece that few people seem to know about yet I expect will become highly regarded and popular on video given a few more years. It's a classic by my standards and I frequently find myself referencing this film as the standard for a great modern film.\r\n\r\nAllow me to recreate my experience of this film and perhaps you'll understand why I'm so drawn to it. Generally, when I get ready to watch a film I entirely expect to hate, I set up my computer and get some work done as I watch it. This film started off the same: a futuristic world where women can no longer bear children for some unexplained reason--science so soft it makes Star Trek look like the Mythbusters. Whatever, get my laptop and start wikipedia-ing the first random noun that pops into my head. Oh, I didn't know Han Solo was originally concieved as a giant 7-foot lizard, that totally would have ruined the movie and made me--HOLY CRAP DID THAT COFFEE SHOP JUST 'SPLODE!!!\r\n\r\nI got hooked. I put my laptop away and watched this movie from beginning to end without ever getting bored or looking for something else to do. That's part of the appeal of this film, its ability to surprise. This isn't just one isolated event, the movie is filled with countless eye-popping, realistic moments that draw you into the story and the characters. Nothing comes off as far-fetched, in fact even the futuristic feel of the movie is toned down to the point where you can see this world being plausible in ten or twenty years (as oppossed to the traditional flying cars and colonies on the moon schtick). Like farting in a crowded elevator, this movie envelops you with its atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnother typical Hollywood moment this movie consciously sidesteps is the necessity of a love interest for the protagonist. I groaned when Julianne Moore stepped on-screen as Clive Owen's ex-wife and hinted at a future hook-up. Fortunately the movie saw this looming disaster of predictability and (SPOILER ALERT) promptly shot her in the head during a spectacular car chase. \"Alright,\" the movie seemed to say, slapping its hands together to remove the dirt from her freshly dug grave, \"back to the good stuff.\" \r\n\r\nThe car chase also demonstrates another strong aspect of the film--the art of the single-shot. Unlike a Michael Bay film (can you tell I don't like him yet?) who spits out shots like Woody Allen does movies, Alfonso Cuaron pushes the limit of what he can get into a single scene. Actually, until this movie I never realized how short most shots are in other films. I suppose they do this becuase they believe short shots keep the action flowing but Cuaron proves just how wrong they are with the final battle scene--an epic five minutes of Owen darting between cover as all hell erupts around him. What Cuaron does best is immersion, he makes you feel as if you're in this reality.\r\n\r\nThis is a great film, the best I've seen in years. The action is gripping, the characters are flawed but likeable, the atmosphere is perfect, the messages are subtle and well-thought out, and the story is...well, there--its not amazing yet it holds everything together pretty well. I consider it more about a dystopian future and the people who inhabit it rather than a story you'll tell your kids at bedtime. For a crazy premise about global infertility, it portrays the world richly enough that I believe if such an infeasible tragedy occured it would look like this. Maybe you'll disagree with that but I can promise you one thing: you'll love every minute of it. Now go enjoy the blessing of fertility, make 'dem babies.",

            "content": "An almost futuristic dsytopian society, yet realistic and seemingly true, Children of Men is an engaging and fraught with tension thriller that pushes the boundaries of acceptable worlds. Though many films misuse the term futuristic to include out of this world inventions, cataclysmic empires that reach vast lengths, ruled by some evildoer, and an inconceivable universe Children of Men takes place only a bit down the line, knows when to keep cool under pressure, and advances its plot based on the characters and not a contentious ideal of what the future will be like in twenty years. Some amazing acting from a cast that reaches down deep, including an activist Julianne Moore, scientist Michael Caine, and our lead Clive Owen, a man who has given up hope though in his youth he was just the same wild idealist as his former partner. The film moves at a fast pace, and explains itself as it goes. The main idea seems to be that human life, however eroded by greed and corruption, is worth preserving, and even in a world that seems to have ordered chaos, there is always a hand climbing out of the darkness to capture you. I thought the performances were the best part, especially that of Michael Caine who plays a role so unlike him, and yet works well with his own talents. Owen is usually the brash action star or the quiet man behind the scenes, but here he downplays his entire involvement, conceding that the mother of the first child in the world is obviously the hero of the story, and leads her to Earth's victory, however bittersweet. I loved the cinematography, the one shot action scenes of explosions and subterfuge, and the story itself, which stands as one unobstructed by petty villains, insidious government actions, and high brow heroes with inferiority complexes. Though cultural and political differences are shown in an almost heavyhanded approach, I liked it still, because it was somewhat honest and looked to the future with a broad understanding of socio-economic ties, as well as the intentions of the media and the roles of poor individuals and their motives and ensuing actions. Really a stark realization of what lies ahead.",

Anyways, the movie is well crafted and the most well photographed movie I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n delivers a moving and alarming picture focused on a near future in which humans have lost the ability to reproduce. The world seems to have descended into chaos, with Great Britain being what seems to be among the last functioning governments on the planet. Clive Owen shines as an apathetic, greedy office worker who's seemed to have lost his will to live among the fascist government and the terrorist groups which combat it. He is commissioned by his exwife played by Julianne Moore to aide her cause in transporting a young immigrant across the country to the coast to get her to the Lifeboat Project. What he doesn't know at first is that she is the first pregnant woman in nearly 20 years. With the help of a lady who used to be a midwife and of course the always amazing Michael Caine and his connections, he makes his way across the country, evading the group which he escaped from and the government who would want the girl for their own gain. An phenomenal film, one that will leave you breathless and with a look of concern on your face. See this movie!",

The cast is brilliant from Michael Caine to Julianne Moore who plays their characters convincingly and believably, as you would imagine a great cast is needed for a film with such high dramatic stakes which children of men delivers on. The way it is filmed mimics the style of Stephen Spielberg in war or the words, from the long dramatic drawn out shots of action too the more dramatic moments when an innocent character is taken out of action. This is a sad film to experience but its riveting and provides food for thought about where we are heading in the future and if it will be as bright as we hope.",

Case in point: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  The world he created is unique to him, yes, but doesn't work as a translation of the novel. \r\n\r\nChildren of Men is nothing short of a masterpiece thanks to Cuaron's directing though.  It's a beautiful, elegaic film that starts at the end of civilization.  Humans have lost the ability to reproduce, and the youngest man on earth, the last baby ever born, is killed in a terrorist attack.  Clive Owen's character Theo watches this happen with all the apathy and world-weariness of a man who's lived too long in a world too bleak.  He seems a poor recruit for Julianne Moore's character, who asks him to help her protect the world's most precious cargo: a pregnant young woman.  \r\n\r\nThere are times when Children of Men feels oppressively dark.  The world Cuaron creates is so vivid, so real, and so believable that it drinks in its audience and demands attention.  It's a visceral film, one that crawls under your skin and lingers long after the credits roll.  But Children of Men is also a film about hope, and somehow, amidst all the death and destruction, this fact is never forgotten and always exists on the periphery of the audience and the characters' vision.",

Smart,well written,great performances,awesome action and refreshing originality all combined to make one of the greatest sci fi/political social allegories ever made. Clive Owens gives a great performance as a very regular guy caught up in extrordinary events. One of the greatest things about his performance is that he plays his character very realistically. In other action movies the main character would either be a regualr guy or a police man or ex marine but either way he would pick up a gun and start blowing guys away. Not in this movie. Clive is a office worker with no millitary or combat training at all and I thought that it was great that the film makers stuck with that and never once had him pick up a gun and start shooting people. This is just one example of the great originality in this picture.This film is very dark but it is also very intersting and fast paced,providing enough action,suspense and excitement so that you never get bored or fall asleep. Another great thing about this movie is that even though there are some obvious political undertones the film doesnt mark either side as clear cut good guys or bad guys,the army and the immigrant rights rebels are just as evil or good as each other,basically it isnt really that obvious wich side is worse. This is a greatly compelling film,I just dont know what more I can say.It has great style,writting,action,character developement,acting and it has true originality. It is really obvious that the director Alfonso Cuaron knew what he was doing and I hope he continues to make more great films. An absolutely fantastic film.",

Out of the blue, journalist and former political activist Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is approached by his ex-wife and entrusted with helping a woman to saftey from the turmoil of the city. Theo soon finds out that the reason why, is because she is the worlds only pregnant woman and may be the only hope humanity have left for survival.\r\nDirector Cauron paints a horrific yet entirely believable vision of a bleak, not too distant future with brilliantly realistic action scenes and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Burn After Reading) is the most intense and gripping I've seen in recent years. Clive Owen is perfectly cast as the rugged, world weary Theo and Michael Caine adds a welcome touch of humour as his aging, hash smoking hippie friend Jasper.\r\nAn absolutely harrowing and hauntingly realistic vision of a dystopian world and impossible to take your eyes of the screen.

This taut and thought-provoking tale may not have the showy special effects normally found in movies of this genre, but you won't care one bit after the story kicks in, about a dystopic future where women can no longer conceive and hope lies within one woman who holds the key to humanity's survival.

Out of the blue, journalist and former political activist Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is approached by his ex-wife and entrusted with helping a woman to saftey from the turmoil of the city. Theo soon finds out that the reason why, is because she is the worlds only pregnant woman and may be the only hope humanity have left for survival.\n Director Cauron paints a horrific yet entirely believable vision of a bleak, not too distant future with brilliantly realistic action scenes and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Burn After Reading) is the most intense and gripping I've seen in recent years. Clive Owen is perfectly cast as the rugged, world weary Theo and Michael Caine adds a welcome touch of humour as his aging, hash smoking hippie friend Jasper.\n An absolutely harrowing and hauntingly realistic vision of a dystopian world and impossible to take your eyes of the screen.

I say this because so often when some people read about a work being compared to a prior film they assume the new film lacks originality. Well, Children of Men is brimming with originality, yet I find myself reminded of other great motion pictures. Perhaps surprisingly I think of Fellini's Satyricon which depicts an ancient era that eerily feels futuristic, with the protagonist stumbling across grotesques throughout. Children mirrors this in that it's future looks starkly like the collapsing of any historical empire, characters trying to sort out some personal salvation - by  mysticism, political revolution, etc. \r\n\r\nI find a palatable sense that this is a conscious anti-Blade Runner, in it's sly unobtrusive technology scattered throughout vs. Ridley Scott's in-your-face Sci-Fi Futurism. Still, in an odd way they make possible companions for a double feature. As if in parallel universes both main characters are dragged out of a life of Kafkaesque resignation into a mission to deal with outcasts trying to blend into society. Both eventually become immersed in their respective missions and appear capable of giving the supreme sacrifice at the end of their films, despite initially harboring no strong convictions about anything. Like Blade Runner, I think Children of Men will grow in esteem and people will eventually look back and wonder why the film wasn't a much bigger success.",

This bleak, invigorating and thought-provoking look into \"what could be\" the future is pure cinematic gold.\r\n\r\nWhether it be the absolutely astonishing Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, the masterful direction by Alfonso Cuaron or the great performances by the cast, this film is mesmerizing.\r\n\r\nSet in a dystopian United Kingdom in 2027 where no child has been born in the entire world for 25 years and most of the world is in ruins. But \"Britain Soldiers On!\" in the film. A fascist, monarchic country is what Britain has become.\r\n\r\nI don't really want to go into full on plot synopsis because I could type for hours about this film and if you don't know the plot of the film, GO LOOK IT UP, NOW.\r\n\r\nAs I was saying. Children Of Men is a film that literally works on all levels. It's an intelligent and thought-provoking drama, a exciting and incredibly well-done action movie and a bleak look into the future.\r\n\r\nThe film is bolstered by top-notch performances by the Cast, with many notable performances from Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and especially Michael Caine who, quite frankly, surprised me with his very offbeat and eccentric performance as the cannabis-smoking political activist and former political cartoonist, \"Jasper\".\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is revolutionary in this film. One of director Alfonso Cuaron's cinematic trademarks, long \"one-take\" shots that usually involve many complex actions taking place in the background and foreground is in full play in this movie. I cannot explain this film's cinematography with words, an since that's all I'm able to do on Rotten Tomatoes, I can merely encourage everyone to view this film for all its worth.\r\n\r\nThis film deserved more commercial recognition and recognition from the Academy and various other Film Award Ceremonies.\r\n\r\nGive this film it's due and go buy it and enjoy it today.",

            "content": "Nowadays, we expect zombies, massive disasters, an ignorant military or aliens to be responsible for some global apocalypse, but Children of Men presents an entirely new vision for the end; extinction. \r\n\r\nThe main premise of the film is that humanity has lost the ability to reproduce for the past 18 years. And because of that, the world has fallen to chaos and anarchy, leaving Britain as the only politically stable country left. But just because Britain is the last stable country left doesn't make it the only sane one. Violent deportations, acts of discrimination and protest actions have taken place ripping the already dying nation apart. \r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anymore details, the main plot is that Theo (Clive Owen) is forced to help get the first pregnant lady in years get out of Britain before the oppressive government or the extremists use her for their own goals.Along the way, multiple political allegories are shown alongside with disturbing imagery of a dying race. From start to finish, the film relies on the feeling of hopelessness and dread to get its message through, and it works. The drama is carried further with the acting of everyone, whether major or minor characters.  \r\n\r\nBy far one of the darkest and best films I've seen, this movie's the rare symbolic/ political/ daring film we haven't seen too many times since the 80's (A Clockwork Orange, anyone?). Believe me, this movie is better seen than just read about; I had my doubts at first since it wasn't really popular then but after watching it twice, I learned that those who ignored this movie are missing what could be the best film of the decade.

So how can an idea like that make such a gripping film?\r\n\r\nThe year is 2027, there hasn't been a child born in 18 years. The world is in tatters and only London stands tall. But the cost was great; London is now a landfill of death, violence and injustice. We follow Theo (Clive Owen) on a journey that could, maybe, just maybe, give back the world the hope it so desperate needs. \r\n \r\nChildren Of Men starts with an explosion, a shock that doesn't let up for a single second for all it's 109 minuets runtime. To give such a bold and bleak interpretation of the world can only come from the mind of the man that took the fluffy franchise which was Harry Potter, turned it on it's head and into the brilliance which was The Prisoner Of Azkaban,  I speak of course of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. \r\n\r\nCuar\u00f3n  depressing glance into the future will shake each of us to our very souls, that is one of the more unique things about Children Of Men, that unlike other films set in the future, (eg: I, Robot orMinority Report,) the future Cuar\u00f3n depicts is believable. Personally, I attribute this realism to the fact that the future Cuar\u00f3n sees is deep rotted in the present we live in today. Children Of Men has no flying cars, that run of LSD or thoughts of heroes, their cars are the same as today's only more aware of danger with installed windows to give advanced warning to the drivers; it's the subtle things like that which make Children Of Men special. Another example is that Dope is still illegal. The smallest details are thought of in Children Of Men, and it all adds in it's favor.\r\n\r\nIf you can imagine and cope with it, Children Of Men is bleaker than V for Vendetta. The film is set in a baron and disfigured London town, where terrorism is everywhere, and no one is safe. This makes us feel as an audience... edgy, like anything could happen. Children Of Men has no guarantees, only the power of the film itself. \r\n\r\n1984 for this generation. Children Of Men is shocking, compelling and intimidating and amazing.

            "content": "Children of Men is a science fiction thriller of sorts. It seems to hang its hat on action sequences rather than storytelling, and this is the primary reason I did not enjoy the film as much as the community at large. However, in the areas where the film succeeds, it succeeds quite marvelously. Ultimately, I felt like the film's story left a few important questions left unanswered. \r\n\r\nThe film has an engaging premise. The year is 2027. Women have become infertile (or it could be that men are shooting blanks - it is never really explained). No child has been born in 18 years. It seems that the current 18-year-old generation is the last generation of humanity. What is to be done? How can humanity be saved, if it can be saved at all? The film takes off from there, moving at what I considered to be an enjoyably aggressive pace. \r\n\r\nThe film takes place in Britain, and since it is only 18 years in the future, the city-scapes are very familiar, resembling what we are used to. However, the buildings, the streets, and the people are in a sickening state of decay. The sets impressively render these ominous details, and this decomposing environment help to infect the film's hectic plot with an added degree of bleakness. \r\n\r\nClive Owen stars in this film, playing a man named Theo. Initially, Theo seems detached from the world's sad state, indifferent to what appears to be the impending apocalypse. After twenty years of separation, he is unexpectedly contacted by his ex-wife, who has become heavily involved in an anti-government faction. This faction is bent on inciting what they call \"The Uprising,\" which is basically an overthrow of the current government. Theo's ex-wife needs his help. Reluctantly, Theo agrees to help her. I had problems here. At first, Theo's indifference seemed unshakable. Then he becomes wrapped up in this anti-government movement. This transformation is fine and interesting, I just thought the conviction with which Clive Owen embodied the transformation was a bit unconvincing. To me, it felt feigned. \r\n\r\nThe film's story is at once intriguing, but to me, it quickly became saturated in simplicity, leaving important holes in the plot unexplained. For example, humans have become unable to reproduce. How did this happen? Why did it happen? These questions are not addressed. In the film 28 Days Later, we are offered that first introductory scene with the chimps who have been infected with rage. Though brief, it provides an explanation of how the world came to be in the sad state it is in when the film takes place. In Children of Men, we are offered no such explanation. This bothered me. \r\n\r\nWithout spoiling the film's plot, my next issue is geared towards those who have seen the film. It pertains to the young girl whom Theo strives to protect. Her name is Kee. My question is: Why her? Why is she so special? What is it about her that allows her to perform what is perceived as a miracle? In the context of the film's story, it occurs to me that her extraordinary condition is worthy of explanation. Perhaps it is unfair of me, but I demanded an explanation, and I never received one. \r\n\r\nLastly, because of the story's simplicity, I felt like the film descended into action sequences. There's nothing wrong with this. In fact, some of the action sequences were brilliant and shot with incredible innovation. However, I felt like the extensive action in the film was a substitute for what could've been an extremely interesting and engaging story. \r\n\r\nChildren of Men is a good film. Don't get me wrong. I liked it. It has been well-received by the vast majority of film fans. And I feel I understand why. It is engaging and demands your attention. The movement of the film is riveting. I just didn't feel the film realized its potential in terms of story. And I will admit, my main focus of film is on the story. So perhaps I am criticizing the film from the wrong angle. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I would recommend the film to anyone. It is spontaneous and engrossing. Surely, it is entertaining. I don't think anyone would regret having seen this film.",

Above average cast, Owen is quite well and Caine is damn fine as usual, along with Ashitey and Ferris, as well as most of the supporting cast. Strangely I didn't find Ejiofor to be that great which is unusual as he is a fabulous actor.

            "content": "What can I say, I'm just a sunny kinda guy:  continuing with my recent tour of films about the apocalypse, I turn now to Alfonso Cuaron's \"Children of Men.\"  The first thing that I have to report is that this film is just as grim as, but far more engaging than, my last experience with Michael Haneke's awful \"Time of the Wolf.\"  Perhaps the difference is that the characters here are not deflated, listless, and beaten; they are actively resisting their fates.  Perhaps the difference is in production values; which is to say, \"Children of Men\" has some.  And they are fairly awesome.  This is a fully fleshed-out world; in Haneke's film I felt detached from the protaganists despite the gritty realism, but here the burnt-out buildings, rubble-strewn streets, and omnidirectional gunfire are irresistably all-encompassing.  I felt the urge to duck in my seat at several points.  Clive Owen nails the feel of his role exactly; he is not an indestructible action hero, just an ordinary guy completely freaked by the mess he's gotten himself into.  He is Theo, a low-level government employee in a Britain which stands as the world's last-remaining organized nation.  Catastrophe and violence have erupted across the globe with the realization that the human race, for reasons unknown, has become sterile (I have a problem with this premise, but more on that later).  He has a whacked out, aged-hippie friend (Michael Caine) with a hidden place in the woods where they both get high.  The country is exploding in violence all around him as it forcibly removes illegal immigrants.  There is a resistance movement, headed by Theo's ex-lover (Julianne Moore, terrific as always).  They had a child together, a child that died.  He has not seen her in a long, long time.  She wants something from him:  she asks him to use his position to fabricate transit papers for a mysterious young immigrant woman named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey).  He wants something from her:  he needs money.  They are obviously still in love.  Kee is preganant.  Moore's group, the Fishes, fears that if the pregnancy became public Kee and her baby would be interned and exploited by the British government.  When Theo obtains the transit papers, they specify that he must accompany her to the coast.  Not all of the Fishes are what they appear to be.  Soon, Theo will find himself surrounded by horror and loss.  He will become an honorary mid-wife as he and Kee run from...well, everybody.  The actors all convey their respective desperations so realistically that I was tempted to take my pulse, or a valium.  This movie is intense.  The scenes of action are not slick kinetic ballet, but rather frantic scrabbles for survival, executed with hair's-breath timing and genuine suspense.  There is much we don't learn about the sterility, the world-wide collapse, and the reason for Kee's pregnancy, and this is intentional.  We are trapped in the London fog with these people, and we feel with them and for them.  The execution of this film is virtually flawless, and I was genuinely swept up in the drama.  A word about this premise though:  The movie is based on a novel by P.D. James.  I've been watching these end of the world flicks in a comp lit class that I am taking, and the professor mentioned that in the novel, the world hasn't gone to the hell in a handbasket that it appears as in the cinematic version.  I assume that this decision was made in order to lend gravity to the drama, but it distracted me with questions like:  wouldn't a decrease in the human population, short-term, lead to BETTER living conditions?  Ya know, less competition for resources, that kind of thing?  Isn't it possible that UNIVERSAL human sterility might bring mankind together in the search for a cure?  Obviously, the inability to produce children becomes a rather thorny catastrophe for society a few decades down the road, but I don't understand why it would produce war.  What are these nations and people fighting over, exactly?  Put the politics aside though, and what you have is a thoroughly powerful human drama about maintaining one's humanity in a world where civilization has broken down.  Theo begins the movie searching for weed, booze, and a place where he doesn't have to watch the news.  He will soon put out the blunt and poor out the bottle; he takes one look at preganant Kee and discovers that he's not as apathetic as he thought.  As the \"Children of Men\" fight over The Fate Of The World, one woman holds the key to its survival.  She will remind Theo, and us, that we have the power to change, to make new and life-affirming choices, right up until the hour of our deaths.",

Unexpectedly brutal violence that wasn't ludicrously over the top, and some good acting. \r\n\r\nThe plot wasn't very complex, but it didn't need to be. Its 2027 and everyone is infertile. There hasn't been a baby in 18 years, so the world has gone to the dogs. Some parts of Britain are attempting to maintain peace and civility, but the government has decided to deport anyone who isn't British. Obviously, this has caused many people to be angry with the government. One day Theo (Clive Owen) gets kidnapped and is asked to help get transport documents for a refugee so she can escape the government. He agrees in exchange for five thousand pounds. However as he starts to take her to a safe house, they are ambushed and the girl is not simply a refugee. So the race is on to get to safety while evading the government and other hidden dangers.\r\n\r\nA stellar film, escpecially if you aren't afraid of bleak films that show the downward spiral of earth. 9/10",

Just enough technology to feel like things had progressed without going over the top like every Hollywood vision of the future seems to do.\n\nClive Owen plays his part extremely well and the Michael Caine was perfect as the weed-growing ex-cartoonist hippy. I actually thought all of the acting was brilliant, with the exception of Sid who I thought was a rather stereo-typical pastiche of his character-type.\n\nDon't expect this to be a happy film. It's not. But it's worth watching as I think it's probably one of the best (if not THE best) British film I have seen.\n\nI felt the ending left me feeling a little bit cheated - I'd watched the film, seen the story unfold but I never found out if the actions of the protagonists made a difference to their world in the end.",

No humans have been born for years and everyone in the film seems convinced that this is the end of humanity.  The world is being dragged down by fear and for many people moral sensibility has gone out the window.  It looks like humanity has taken a step backward here in terms of evolution.   \r\n\r\nThe most brilliant part (spoiler) is when Theo (played by Clive Owen) helps Kee (played by Clare-Hope Ashitey) emerge from a building that is besieged by soldiers and tanks.  There is exchange of fire between the people in the building and the soldiers and it all stops as Kee and Theo walk out of the building together (with a baby in hand).  Everyone looks at them and as they leave the scene the battle resumes...  \r\n\r\nThis movie is both comical and thought provoking.

That's right, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (my favorite installment in the series) is only number two. This film portrays a scary world where new children have not been born in eighteen years due to a pandemic flu that has made its way across the entire globe. Because of that, humanity is on the verge of extinction after the remaining life has died off. All of the countries have collapsed, except for the United Kingdom's, who is now the only livable place left. The British government is doing all it can to keep the endless flocks of immigrants who seek refuge out, meanwhile an anti government group called Fishes is plotting an up rise to fight for the immigrants who do not get treated equally. \r\n\r\nIt's a very heavy plot to grasp. Not complicated, but the tone of this film is so somber, and it never lets up. I was almost depressed watching it, but the last twenty minutes or so really helped to get the weight off of my shoulders. For such a dark toned film, it has a beautifully bright appearance (some of the cinematography I've ever seen). I really don't know how else to explain it, but its beautiful. The scariest part to me is that it was set only seventeen years from now (2027, for those of you who cannot add...:P). This is, without a doubt, one of the best post apocalyptic movies ever made. It may be too soon to call it a classic, but I'll do it anyway. The cast is top notch. Clive Owen, Michael Caine, Julianne Moore and Chiwetel Ejiofor are the only recognizable actors in it, but everyone with the slightest bit of screen time was phenomenal. This is a damn near perfect film. How it didn't go home with a single Academy Award is far beyond me. I highly recommend Children of Men to everyone.",

They face lots of difficulties until the child comes to this world.\r\n\r\nThe film showcases a very sad face of how humanity might get in the future. Lots of terror, lots of killing and murders. And the punishment for the human race for all this is to see no children anymore so it will risk the mankind existance.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is just mindbowling in the movie. it had very intense dark atmosphere.

It is simply unbelievable how deep the message of this movie reaches and how much there is to find underneath the surface, the surface that is cruel, dirty and relentless. It really takes a great deal of commitment for something like this, a mish mash of emotions, action and art to appear as a picture acceptable for wider crowds. This movie balances unbelievably well between art and entertainment and it probably did deserve more than just three nominations, but I have long ago stopped narrowing myself with the statuettes to determine the film's virtue instead of me. There are so much allusions of today's society that it is hard to even notice all of them. The whole genre of Science Fiction actually has a purpose of showing the todays society as a one big allegory, with an exception of those SciFi movies that only try to entertain you (in a very shallow way most of the time), and Children of Men succeded in both.\r\n\r\nBritain soldiers on. This incredibly reminded me of the movie V for Vendetta which is at the very peak of my list of the best movies. Britain managed to maintan at least some kind of order in their country but with very strict regime whose terror has more and more enemies, and the rest of the world is in chaos. An extremely attractive theme field in both of the movies, at least twas for me. So, the story of this one is set in 2027. and the refugees from all over the world are swarming into Britain where the authorities brutally capture and cram them into refugee camps. The conditions there are probably almost as bad as in the countries they have fled from. I didn't mention that the whole civilization is facing extinction as the women are infertile and the youngest person was born back in the year of 2009. The main character is Theo played by Clive Owen and although he has enough worries of his own, he is about to become a guardian of a refugee girl carying an unborn child, a so called miracle. She becomes the target of the government and the extremist groups also and Theo must do everything to protect the girl and the baby too.\r\n\r\nNow, I'd like to say something about the camerawork in this movie. I have never noticed a so conspicuos lenght of a one cut. It really worked for me as something innovative, and was particulary effective in some action scenes, like the siege at Bexhill which is maybe my favourite scene from a movie I have ever seen. It functioned so real and live that some of the action directors could use this scene as a model for their projects. Really stunning stuff, although at the end of this long cut comes the only part of the movie I did not like. That small part tends to be a cliche and it is a bit hard to believe it would happen, but with this small minus I still think the film is near perfection.\r\n\r\nClive Owen won me over with this role. I have seen him in several movies but I think this is his absolute number one. I have a very high opinion of his movie and role choosing and alongside Children of Men I thought he was excellent in Sin City, Closer, King Arthur and The Bourne Identity. There are much more movies I haven't seen him in and I'd very much like to. His character of Theo Faron seems very simple and everyday-like at first but step by step we are introduced with his inner fights and painful past which I thought Owen developed very well throughout the story.\r\nMichael Caine is someone i just like to see. His appearance is something special and wherever I have seen him I've really liked him. The role of Jasper was based on the character of John Lennon and it was really fun to see and hear Jasper's jokes, theories about life and the cultivation and consumation of various weeds.\r\n\r\nDuring the movie I heard the mumbling of my native language among the refugees and extremists of Britain which really made me laugh at times. It is actually quite interesting how many parallels this story has with the Bible, particulary the part where a girl is carrying a baby that is supposed to be the hope and salvation for mankind. Some additional data I've read also got me thinking like the fact that Theo never used a firearm during the whole movie, or that he never got a chance to smoke a cigarette 'till the end. The name Theo Faron means \u00abThe God Of Lighthouses\u00bb in Greek which could be interpret in various ways. I was stunned by the large painting of Guernica on the wall, which has obvious meaning in real life and in Children of Men it only adds up to the artistic feeling.\r\n\r\nAnyone who cares one bit about the quality of the movie, about something that surpasses entertainment only, should feel obliged to see this. I will never forget Children of Men and I'll be glad to see it a few more times. Recommendations to absolutely everyone.",

The movie portrays that every country on the Earth's hemisphere is collapsing in many shapes and forms. Crime rates have increased over all of the countries, and mass explosions have been caused. All of this because of the fact that people have given up on life, where hope is scarce, and the future is devastating. People who have gone mad, which is a very large percentage of the Earth have been locked up in cages and camps, so that they cannot cause any more destruction. Most of the Earth is playing out like to be a war-like zone, where soldiers are numerous, and death is it's shadow. The movie portrays an normal office-man in the country of Britain, where he has to transport a girl to safety due to her being the first pregnant woman in over twenty years. Her family fears that because of her pregnancy, people will take her out because she is different from the entire rest of the world. The man, along with the girl and here family, encounter many dangerous and insane situations. This movie offers a great deal of suspense, along with some very dry humor, which is why it is was acclaimed as one of the best movies of 2006. It got three Academy Award Nominations for visually imagery, and for me, was one of the top five movies of 2006. Four out of four stars.

            "content": "Children of Men is one of the finest Dystopian films I have seen in many years. The film opens on a dirty London street with the news on a TV in a coffee shop. It's obvious that most of the world is blown to shit and Britain is one of the last bastions of civilization in the world. We then see news of the youngest man in the world being killed. Now, the idea of everyone knowing who the youngest person in the world is, is, for me striking. The idea that in a hundred years there will be no people left. What the hell. The reason why women have been left infertile is not known, at least, it's not public if it is known. Clive Owen plays a government employee by the name of Theo Farron, who's ex wife just happens to be the leader of a civil rights organization that is trying to get the British government to stop their persecution of illegal immigrants. Theo is contacted after many years by his ex wife and is asked to secure safe passage out of Britain to the Azores for a young female named Kee. It is later shown that Kee is pregnant. Let that sink in, the first pregancy in 18 years. That's quite a thought, and not really in a hopeful way. This kid hasn't a chance, in my mind, not even if Kee makes it to \"The Human Project\" which is some sort of scientist commune in the Azores committed to curing infertility. The atmosphere in the film is dark, gritty and just a tad too real for my taste. This film puts human nature in your face, both for the better and worse. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Kee is trapped in a immigrant building under seige by government troops. Once she gets to the ground floor and the first trooper sees her, there is an immediate cease fire, every one of them is shocked, with a confused and often blessed look in their eye. It shows that every human has the same core wants and needs and no matter where you are form to see the last hope for humanity before your eyes for the first time, is a religious experience. Maybe later, once the shock wears off, they'd go and be a bastard again, but for that one perfect moment, bliss, hope. It's moving, as are many scenes in this film. The ending is vague and honestly not comforting, which is really how the whole human race operates anyway. There is never any sure thing, only the unknown, it's terrifying if you think too long on it, and Children of Men makes you think about it, the uncertainty of being human. It's masterful, it's a must-see.",

            "content": "Based on PD James' novel this movie stars Clive Owen and the short lived Julianne Moore. Anything with Clive Owen serves as a hit for me, even King Arthur. The story takes place in a dystopian society where women are unable to become pregnant for unexplained reasons, but one can conclude it came as a result of man's mistake in one way or another that they have brought themselves or from a higher power. For example, the film's title is derived from Psalm 90:3: \"Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.\" The movie lightly graces us with the theories as to why this is happening but the fact of the matter is, and what makes the movie even more compelling is that it doesn't matter, or there are bigger issues at play. Not only are you caught asking other questions right away, waiting for their answer as you watch, but the smaller detailed questions overshadow the big picture which is what makes the film watchable again and again.\r\n\r\nFor example, instead of asking the obvious question as to why women cannot become pregnant, you are caught up in the ripples of its cause and start swimming in questions that cause the viewer to explore parallels in modern society. The film makes a strong statement in regards to the anti-immigration sentiment in modern societies like the UK and USA. Flocking to the UK because of the state that their own nations have come to, the immigrants in the film are marginalized, caged up, deported and even executed to express the chaos, disintegration of society and assimilation of a higher, more righteous race and/or nation.\r\n\r\nThe film's director took great care in placing subtle images from contemporary history and placed them into the film to prove that, though this is a fictional story, these monstrosities are indeed happening and have happened before our eyes. For example the director states:\r\n\r\n\"They exit the Russian apartments, and the next shot you see is this woman wailing, holding the body of her son in her arms. This was a reference to a real photograph of a woman holding the body of her son in the Balkans, crying with the corpse of her son. It's very obvious that when the photographer captured that photograph, he was referencing La Pieta, the Michelangelo sculpture of Mary holding the corpse of Jesus. So: We have a reference to something that really happened, in the Balkans, which is itself a reference to the Michelangelo sculpture. At the same time, we use the sculpture of David early on, which is also by Michelangelo, and we have of course the whole reference to the Nativity. And so everything was referencing and cross-referencing, as much as we could\"\r\n\r\nSpecifically the director has provided multiple subtle references to the holocaust from the execution methods seen and used in the film to the scene where an elderly refugee woman speaking German is seen detained in a cage.\r\n\r\nDespite the subtle contemporary parallels, the highly innovative single-shot action sequences are perhaps the most memorable parts of the direction of the film. It is incredible to see the main character, Theo run from the chaotic streets in the refugee camp as he is transporting Kee the pregnant girl to safety as they encounter a very realistic point of view. At one point Theo gets shot in the leg and blood spatters onto the screen. The splatter of blood does not leave the screen for a couple minutes after Theo is able to catch his breath. It gave me the sense that if I were there I would have blood on my face following Theo and wouldn't have the chance to wipe it off until the same moment that Theo has to catch his breath. This first person type of editing is also used in the audio as gunfire is shot near Theo and the chasing camera, so as a result the sound is very limited and ringing for a period of time it would take to recover your hearing after being so close to gunfire. This type of audio technique with gunfire is becoming popular and used in other movies as well, I love it.\r\n\r\nThe best part of the film in my opinion is when Theo is able to rescue Kee from a building facing gunfire as she is holding the baby she gave birth to the night earlier. The baby won't stop crying and as a result the mere sound of something that we can't stand to hear ironically becomes the sound that stops the gunfire and everyone suddenly tunes into. It is here that I believe everyone stops not only because they haven't heard the sound of a baby in decades but they wonder for a moment what they are even fighting for with the flicker of hope passing them in a baby's cry the hope leaves them as the baby gets carried out of sight and the fighting then continues.\r\n\r\nThe theme of hope is what I will conclude with. The film has been categorized as a modern-day Nativity story. The character of Kee represents Mary and Kee's pregnancy is revealed to Theo in a barn, alluding to the manger of the Nativity scene, and when other characters discover Kee and her baby, they respond with \"Jesus Christ\" or the sign of the cross, even going on their knees when they see it. Throughout the entire movie the main goal is to reach a meeting place of something called \"the human project.\" Almost nothing is revealed about this organization except that it will bring not only salvation for our protagonists but to the entire earth. The human project then is the ultimate metaphor for hope, salvation and if you buy into the film being a modern day Nativity story, it is a metaphor for heaven which can be attained by humankind (to stretch the metaphor further) only with the sacrifice of the very human man Theo who sacrifices himself for mankind's salvation. The movie concludes with the sound of playing children which alludes to the hope that someday there will be children again.\r\n\r\nRotten Tomatoes give this move a 92% rating\r\n\r\nZoom In Analysis will AGREE with this rating although it might be a little too high, maybe more of an 85%.\r\n\r\nSeamless and award-worthy continuity editing. Realistic, innovative action, a captivating depiction of the future and flawless acting make this a must see and a great addition to the Blu-ray collection.",

Not like a boob tube is inappropriate (and they always are), but like tuxedo is for swimming, or socks are for sandals.\r\n\r\nI was lengthening the garden behind the house a little while ago. Gaining an additional three feet of goldfish graveyard by clearing away reams of blackthorn from the hedge. Blackthorn is ferocious stuff, for a bush. After only a few minutes work, my shins looked like Amy Winehouse. All scratched up to bits. So you might think my inappropriate clothing choice for hedge-clearing was shorts. Not so.\r\n\r\nI was wearing flip flops.\r\n\r\nIt transpired that flip flops were a pretty stupid thing to wear, once thorns started poking through into my feet and twigs attached themselves to the underneath, by stabbing.\r\n\r\nIt was this experience, as much as it was down to the directorial skills of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, that captured me fully into the plight of Clive Owen\u0092s character while I was watching Children of Men. IMDB summarises the film like this:\r\n\r\n    In 2027, in a chaotic world in which humans can no longer procreate, a former activist agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea, where her child's birth may help scientists save the future of humankind.\r\n\r\nBut it\u0092s not the plot that made Children of Men so remarkable.\r\n\r\nI should point out at this stage that I am not a fan of Clive Owen. He almost spoiled Sin City for me, and that was full of guns and Mickey Rourke, and prostitutes in their pants. I\u0092ve always thought Owen was just a bit dull, with a plain face and a forgettable demeanour. A bit tossy. And something about the back of his neck bothers me.\r\n\r\nHowever, these qualities (except the neck thing) are intrinsic to why he works so well as the audience\u0092s focus during the course of the story. If we\u0092re honest with ourselves, we\u0092re all a bit dull, and if faced with true jeopardy we would all rather hide. I\u0092m not Bruce Willis, and neither are you. We are regular men and women in the street. Clive Owen isn\u0092t Bruce Willis either, and in the opening moments of the film Owen survives by literally being in the street, and not in the coffee shop shockingly blown up by terrorists.\r\n\r\nThis is the world of the movie, one in which society skates drearily about on the top of a deep pool of anarchy. With no children, and no perceived future, people have stopped bothering with tomorrow. Stopped bothering with one another. London of 2027 is populated by people forlornly killing time until it all just ends.\r\n\r\nOwen is Theo Faron, a low-level civil servant office nobody. Like an arsey student, he\u0092s grown up and sold out to the man, getting on with trudging through life and dulled to the possibility of change. Keeping his head down to stay out of trouble.\r\n\r\nBut trouble finds him. Faron doesn\u0092t so much agree to transport a pregnant girl, as glumly realise that the caring father he used to be never went away. His ability to protect and help was only hidden under the years of drudge and hopelessness. Children of Men is a science fiction film on the ideas plane, an action film on the visual plane, and an exhaustingly fraught thriller all the way through.\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the sheer battering my nerves suffered watching this. Cuar\u00f3n\u0092s handling of action sequences is breathtaking. I suppose we should have guessed he had the right stuff when watching his grim version of Harry Potter. The violence of the film is depicted in a way that is so fresh and involving that my hands were sweating and my innards were thumping in my chest. My eyes copied Faron\u0092s as he frantically scanned the scenery for any survivable options. Even more so than Saving Private Ryan, or A Very Long Engagement, or even Starship Troopers, the conflict sequences in this film cause you to truly question how anyone ever survives a sustained gun battle.\r\n\r\nIn two scenes you will wonder how the action seems so unremittingly intense, with barely a second\u0092s room to catch your breath. Then you suss that they\u0092re done in one shot. Or at least with invisibly hidden edits. One shot scenes, with tanks and motorbike crashes and bullet hits and explosions and complicated dialogue and Clive Owen running about in the murk looking like he\u0092s about to need a new pair of trousers.\r\n\r\nFaron spends a large chunk of the events not quite ready for what\u0092s happening. He tumbles ineptly from one ambush to another, inadvertently tangled up in violence and double-crosses. He constantly wears the look of a man who knows that he doesn\u0092t really know what\u0092s going on. He bluffs his way to action hero status just by having quite good instincts to survive.\r\n\r\nEven if he does steal the only car that won\u0092t start properly. Fails to get answers to important questions from dying friends. And discovers too late that he\u0092s the only one who came to war wearing flip flops.\r\n\r\nThat\u0092s why I was inexorably drawn in. Because Clive Owen runs around dangerous places wearing flip flops and keeps hurting his foot.\r\n\r\nAnd I can relate to that.",

It could have been, but the meat of it was missing. There was no good, smiles,  brightness, explanation, personality, hope, or curiosity. Movies can be depressing and dismal BUT they must capture the human spirit, which is not one ichorous, somber shade of miserable gray. I don't think the entire human population except for about 10 peope would turn into monsters if the world went sour. Some would, of course, but think about yourseves and people you know. Would they all become evil gunslingers when thing got atrocious? No.  So I raised my eyebrows there and because of my disbelief, the film seemed strained and dishonest. Too much gunfire and bombs and not enough purpose. The minimal backstory failed to explain what I wanted to know, or at least flesh out this reality to make it more believable than just a dismal atmosphere (which was all the movie was until the end).\r\nChildren Of Men was \"dark\", yes, but for a film to be truly \"dark\" it must capture the dualities of light and dark that are the human race. THAT is when movies are great. Children Of Men was a mess to me, with no human qualities (except what nuggets are found in our protagonist, though they are unexplained and artless)or motive.\r\nThough I had hoped to adore it as much as other futuristic/alternative reality/dramas, in the end I was as numb as the characters it contained. 2.5/5 stars.",

What impresses me the most about the mise en scene is how what is going around in the scene builds the story, the plot the history of the situation you are in. We know early in this film that imagrants are all exported, and this is reinforced in your brain when you. Another example is how in one of the first scenes of the movie we see people reacting to the death of the youngest person in the world.

This film provides a unique and breathtaking but nonetheless eye-opening dystopian vision of the world. Clive Owen does his usual one-noted shtick to perfection, which is perfect for his role as Theo. Julianne Moore makes a brief but memorable appearance, and Chiwetel Ejiofor is also great. Michael Caine is amusing and entertaining as the old hippie, but feels a tad out of place. Children of Men starts off relatively slow, allowing us to get our heads around the characters and the story. When the pace quickens though, it comes with such a jolt that it will take you a while to recover from it. Another outstanding action sequences is its sequence where Theo is making his way through all the battle fire, a scene that will pin you to your seat as well as take your breath away. Cuaron brings his jet black sense of humour to Children of Men, which some viewers may find off putting and out of place (eg. Michael Caine as a hippie), but it actually works really well. Children of Men was one of the most underrated films of 2006, yet, after Casino Royale, the best. It's absolutely appaling that people were spending money on absoulte tripe like Step Up and The Grudge 2 instead of spending it on this masterpiece. If you missed it, I have two things to say to you.

            "content": "Alfonso Cuaron is a master director. He stages scenes in Children of Men as vivid and terrifying as any I've ever seen at the movies. A left of center vision of a truly awful future, it's based on P.D James' superb novel which interestingly if anything, felt a little right of center. The allusions to Christian theology will prove to be thought provoking for years to come, and the depiction of 2027 is so eerily plausible that when that year rolls around don't say that Cuaron didn't warn ya. This is a gloomy, extremely grim picture shot in somber grays (and a handful of startling single-shot takes) like guerilla journalism by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. The flaw is that Cuaron isn't as always as great staging scenes of dialogue between spectacular set pieces, but that's a small quibble in such a big, horrifying vision.",

            "content": "CHILDREN OF MEN is a riveting and bruising dysotopian thriller that takes the extremities of human extinction and finds disturbing realism in it.  The storyline for the film is well-wrought and endlessly engaging.  The actors themselves are outstanding; with Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine as the big names in Alfonso Cauron's adaptation of the book that goes by the same name.  The real showstopper is newcomer Clare-Hope Ashitey hits strong emotional chords as Kee, the one hope the entire human race can based itself on.    \r\n\r\nThe premise is juicy: not one baby has been born in 18 years (since 2009), meaning the current year in the film is 2027.  All across the world, miscarraiges are taking place and a pill that puts you to sleep forever is very popular.  The world has lost hope for another baby, and that God has abandoned them from taking back the gift of life he gave in the beginning of mankind.  \r\n\r\nAs for the story, it ties together strong characters either compassionate, strong, and humane; or cruel, strong, and inhumane with timeless themes of betrayal, trust, and hope.  The two opposite sides of characters are both hopeful in their plans and relentless in putting them in motion.  Theo (Clive Owen) is basically the beacon of light that the right people could trust.  Everyone else does fall to the wayside in terms of being trustworthy (for their political and socio-economic plans or premature deaths).  \r\n\r\nThe acting could not have been better.  Clive Owen invests his whole being in his character Theo, underplaying his role as to gain sympathy for the shabby and emotionally deterred man before he finds his calling.  Clare-Hope Ashitey is incredible as Kee, as she does convey a down-to-earth sense of responsibity for her situation and character.  Chiewetel Ejifor (most recently in 2012) gives a deceptive and calm performance as a member of a \"terrorist\" group, whose intentions are big for Kee.  Michael Caine and Julianne Moore do their usual best as the former is a pot-smoking, genial aging man, and the latter is the energetic leader of the \"terrorist\" group.  \r\n\r\nDirector Alfonso Cauron has crafted a thrilling and bold dysotopian masterpiece with all the greatness that the best can do.  His use of long shots and close-ups show the up-close disconnection the characters feel towards their crumbling world.  The startling moments of violence are just that, as the dire situations call for violence to be done.  His most striking feature he added to the film is how relatable the dying world is to our own, only that women now can still concieve.  \r\n\r\nA juicy premise, strong characters tied together with the timeless themes of betrayal, trust, and hope, top-notch acting, masterful directing, and the film's relatability to our world makes CHILDREN OF MEN a riveting, bruising and thrilling dysotopian masterpiece.

This taut and thought-provoking tale may not have the showy special effects normally found in movies of this genre, but you won't care one bit after the story kicks in, about a dystopic future where women can no longer conceive and hope lies within one woman who holds the key to humanity's survival. It will have you riveted.",

            "content": "\u0091Children of Men\u0092 is a thought provoking science fiction.\r\n\r\nAlfonso takes us to the time of 2027 where widespread infertility for eighteen years has led to the brink of human extinction. The whole world seems to be in mayhem. Britain seemed to be the only hope for asylum, which was still able to uphold a stable militaristic government with an iron grip. We get introduced to our foremost character \u0091Theo\u0092 who will play a key part in escorting a pregnant girl named \u0091Kee\u0092 to Human Project, which was thought to be a faction of scientists working to cure infertility. I would prefer not to go in too much plot details. In a way, this movie will be a kind of road passage with lots of dramatic and disturbing moments.\r\n\r\nThe bleak nature of the world reminded me of Danny Boyle\u0092s \u009228 Days Later\u0092. Wealth of this movie had been the cinematography, which was truly stunning. Any movie\u0092s success depends on the casting; this movie was no different, perhaps the selection of acclaimed actors like Sir Michael Caine, Clive Owen & Julianne Moore made the overall rich storyline more effectual. Personally I feel this was one of the best performances put up by Clive Owen. Some of the action sequence integrated within the movie had also been of top notch.\r\n\r\nThis movie might not be appeal to everyone considering the nature of the apocalyptic storyline. Still this could be highly recommended for viewing, as the movie succeeds in giving us the notion of hope.",
