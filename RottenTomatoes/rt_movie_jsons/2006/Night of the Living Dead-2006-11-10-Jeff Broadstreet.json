            "content": "\"Watch out there son. You don't wanna get bit!\"  A sort-of re-make which has a graveyard at the beginning and zombies throughout, but this time the group fighting for their lives are holed up at a marijuana farm and do a lot of boring talking. The former-junkie wife character was the best of the bunch but it's Sid Haig's mortician character, who plays a major role in moving the plot along in the second half (with a twist!), which saves this from being a total stinker. No real tension-building, poor line-delivery on several actors' part, a too-loud score, and CGI blood make for a less-than-memorable film, yet the latter portion, with its similarities to \"Re-Animator\" and \"Return of the Living Dead\" helped to save it from total obscurity.",

This is one of the worst remakes of Night of the Living Dead ever.",

            "content": "Remakes in the horror genre rarely matched the original and fewer surpass the original. Sure there are some great remakes like The Fly (1986) and The Thing (1982), but those are a selective few that make a small fraction of good horror remakes. How did this remake come about? The original film was never properly copyrighted, and so it has fallen into public domain, making this remake possible even with no permission from the original creators. Just like most remakes in this genre it failed to understand what made the original such a classic and what new spin it brings elevates no interest.\r\n\r\nNight of the Living Dead 3D follows a group of survivors trapped in a farmhouse battling a siege of undead zombies....pointlessly in 3D! To this film credit it's not a by the number remake departing from the original story. It hits some familiar plot beats like a group sheltering themselves from zombies in a house and Henry Cooper daughter turning into a zombie. On paper it has decent ideas, but in execution the story never comes to life. What changes it brings to the plot do nothing more than put you off guard without building tension. This film has a severe problem to either pad out scenes or stretch out long conversations needlessly to fill it's less than eighty minute running time.  A large portion of the film is filler to the point that a non conflict between Barbara arguing with Cooper family whether or not to be taken to town to get help from the local authority takes up around twenty minutes. Long drawn out conversations make up a majority of the film it feels like it dialogue was written up on the spot. For example, Ben describes a zombie as \"Being way the f*@k out there\". This is (as of now) the worst description of a zombie anyone has ever given. Finally it introduces a last minute villain who appears in a significantly small portion of the film. Our villain in this remake has a flimsy explanation for how he made the dead come back to life (hint: it has something to do with fire). Everything in this remake is tediously drawn out with long conversations that lead nowhere, no sense of suspense or feel of danger, and cardboard cutout characters that label themselves who's going to die in which order.\r\n\r\nActing and production leaves little to the imagination. When it comes to acting every single actor underplay their part. These are some of the calmest horror victims who even in a zombie attack have a cool attitude about death. For them it's just not another Apocalypse to the point that a naked women running to safety surrounded by zombie is nothing that generates interest. Direction is very incompetent unable to conceal it's low budget destroying immersion. It seems the director wanted to make sure the film you were watching is all fakery with outdated special effects. Using for short duration actual black and footage from the original \"Night of the Living Dead\" in a color film. Wide shots exposing the little extras the filmmakers could afford to play zombies. If you want to see zombie carnage you will be disappointed since the zombies mostly attack in groups of one or three. Also, the director pointlessly made this in non-dimensional 3D is the most unnoticeable addition to the film. You'll be asking did I need to see the title card and some guy smoking cigarette shoved in my face. This was clearly filmed to be a 2D film and the extra dimension is flat like the film quality hardly ever on sight. \r\n\r\nNight of the Living Dead 3D is like a zombie looking for something living to tear itself into. It has no entertainment value of any kind and even viewing it with a B movie mindset there's too much drawn out scenes and standard acting leaving little to like.",

This was just one of those okay movie to watch for me.Not too much go on about this movie. It's not great but its definitely bad!\n\nDon't expect this to be anything like the classic! I'm all for originality but for more of a connection with the original, you need more than for the characters to have the same names and setting (the house). Yes, they put their own take on it too with the mortician's secret, what happen within the house, the beginning of the movie and the ending was original. So they get points for that at least but I will see it as a remake but not a very good or mildly good remake of the classic.\n\nIt seems this was done for the 3D effect...like most movies these days are. I didn't see this on the big screen...thank goodness because would have been a waste of money for sure...but from certain scenes, it looks as if the 3D effects were good.\n\nThe story was just okay. It was very similar to the classic in one way or another. It certainly had more surprises than the original but build up to suspense! That's the thing, no suspense in the story. No build-up either way in the story or the with music. I think they could have change the story up a little bit more because it was some slight similarities to it but was mess up with the originality for sure. Plus...it was dry. Not scary at all. Again...where was the suspense! If that was in there then it would be more decent.\n\nThe acting sort of save it. They were okay and that is it. The style and design was horrible.",

Neither Romero or Russo had any involvement and whats most strange about this film is that it takes place outside of the \"Dead\" universe. The characters watch the original black & white film on the tv and reference it throughout the entire movie... its weird and yet I enjoyed it. Of course it's hokey and cliched but I was prepared for the worst and found myself immersed enough to get a kick out of it. The dvd doesn't have an option was revert to 2D and so I watched the entire thing in it's intended 3D. My eyes are a little sore now but overall the 3D was well done. The director understands the format and makes good use of it. Rather the usual cheap pop-out tricks (except for the occasional one) the 3D is used more for atmosphere. The zombies are true to Romero's creatures, however the film seriously lacks gore. Whether this is a nod to the 1968 film or not, I don't know. I expected a piece of shit but ended up entertained.",
