            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nI had heard a little about Little Miss Sunshine and it intrigued me enough to want to see it so I finally caught it on DVD and I was blown away by it's creative edge, it's unique blend of dark humor and painful human emotion. The film is quite simply brilliant!! Anyone who truly loves a very real and powerful story about families that will make you laugh as much as it will make you cry must see this film. What makes the film even more impressive is the outstanding ensemble cast that captures every moment of comedy in such a twisted manner that you almost feel guilt for finding the absolute hilarity in their mixed up and disturbed road trip. On top of that co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are long time partners who have pioneered direction in music videos and documentaries but never truly a feature film and yet they smash one out of the park with this incredible story.\n\nIn essence everyone in this film is a \"supporting actor\" because no one character is more important than the other or more featured. They all have this goal and this way of supporting each other's brilliant performances and ironically the one actor to be nominated for a Golden Globe, I thought, was one of the weaker characters and roles. Greg Kinnear is Richard in another brilliant turn as a character actor for Kinnear. Richard is pig headed, stubborn, well meaning but very demeaning at the same time. He doesn't realize the importance of his family and yet he strives and struggles to do the best by them. This is hands down his best role since \"As Good As It Gets\" and he still shows he can pull off a powerful performance. Impressive as well is the young Paul Dano who plays emotionally tortured and self inflicted teenager Dwayne who has taken a vow of silence until he completes his life goal of joining the air force and flying. Dano captures the tortured teen perfectly and considering he has fewer lines than any other character he has to rely on his body language and talent to carry the role and he does that wonderfully. He also puts forth some of the really emotional parts in the film and I think he should be recognized for his brilliant part. Steve Carell....STEVE CARELL...well as many truly great comedians do (ie: Robin Williams, Will Smith, Jim Carey etc.) Carell finds the role that might show the world he is far more than a slapstick comedian and he really can't hold a serious role. His role is the best in this film hands down. It's more of a subtle performance as Frank, the suicidal, brilliant and gay brother-in-law/brother who is forced to go on the trip because he is on suicide watch. He immediately bonds with the tortured soul of Dwayne, plays provocateur to the overly emotional Richard and ultimately teaches each member of the family something. This is hands down an amazing feat for Carell who should get an Academy Award nomination for this part!! He never breaks the drama to show off a funny side except to be ironic and satirical the way the movie needs to be. Multi-Oscar and Emmy nominated actor Alan Arkin plays the rough and rugged Grandpa who is soft at the core and loves his family dearly but has many regrets about his life. His crazy antics, foul mouth and love for women makes him absolutely hilarious and an outstanding addition to the cast. Arkin is spectacular. And there is young Abigail Breslin who already has an impressive resume of performances including her debut which was in M. Night Shyamalan's Signs where she did an outstanding job. She further proves her young acting ability by playing the baby of the family, Olive whose desire more than anything else in the world is to be in the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. She is the soul of the family in many ways and she is the reason of the trip and ultimately she is the one that brings them all together in the hilarious, unbelievable climax. She does a terrific job!! Finally Toni Collette plays the disenchanted mother Sheryl and I don't mean to downplay her performance but I don't think the character is as strong as some of the others and therefore her performance suffers but she got the Golden Globe nod so what do I know?? As the head of the family desperately trying to hold everyone together and bring some sense of normality to their lives she seems almost like she's falling apart but we don't really get to look too much into that.\n\nSo very few films could pull off being so touching and dark and yet make you howl with laughter so loudly. It is such an incredible road trip film that does without special effects, unrealistic, silly premise or anything else but relies on an incredible cast, a real story, and something and someones that anyone could relate to. It's truly the ultimate story of a wacky family that just loves each other and sticks together. If nothing else the climax of the film when Olive performs at the pageant just might become an instant classic moment in film history and will have you laughing to tears. Everyone and anyone could enjoy this movie and is sure to be an instant classic!! 10/10",

This movie illustrates the harm of beauty standards to young girls, especially when it's being reinforced by a parent.

This movie covers death, suicide, and drug abuse but the filmmaker still managed to make it into a comedy.

You're fucking losers, you're losers! \n\nAnother movie where Toni Collette is part of a dysfunctional family. \n\nAt the beginning I was a little bit confused about the tone. It was serious, but interjected with silly moments. It took a little while before I was able to laugh my ass off at the wild things that happened in this movie. \n\nThe third act of this movie was what made it amazing. It paid off so well all the suffering and dysfunction that happened before it. It was incredibly wild, but at the same time all so wholesome. I love the way they still came together even though each one of them had their own personal struggle and frustration that set them apart. Also there's no preachy or overarching theme. Instead the movie was a lot more mundane, and I appreciate it for that.\n\nOverall, a hilarious and wholesome movie. 8/10",

The characters in this movie all have interesting conflicts and character flaws which make them feel very human. By the end of the movie, I had fallen in love with every member of this family and empathized with everyone. It is a movie that balances comedy and drama well with a solid script and effective performances. I think everyone is great in the movie, but it is truly the performance of Abigail Breslin that brings the whole movie together and it is easy to see how she received an Oscar nomination at such a young age after watching this movie. Overall, it is a feel-good movie that makes both family dysfunction and road trip movies feel completely unique and one of a kind.",

It's got everything that today's 20-something is looking for in a black comedy - depressed characters to relate to, sad subplots to wallow in, and (fortunately) an offbeat but resolutely wholesome redemptive moment to demonstrate the beauty in life that balances (and often contrasts hilariously with) the bad. A wholesome lampooning of American standards of success, the 'gospel of wealth', and economic Darwinism, Little Miss Sunshine argues that worth is measured more in intangibles than objective terms, embracing an innate awkwardness we all have and the naturally volatile chemistry that we share with others. Solid casting choices, including an ambitious and unintentional crossover between arguably the two most impactful shows of the 2000-10 decade, The Office (Carell) and Breaking Bad (Cranston and Norris), help hammer home a solid script in this classic that will feel fresh as long as people feel dissatisfied with their performance in life. Child pageants are just one of the freakiest events that is normalized in American culture. (4/5)",

            "content": "I have seen this film countless times mostly because it appeals to my family who enjoy this sort of dysfunctional family bands together amidst a mildly comedic plot. I really do like the film despite the sharp criticisms it receives from many because it feels genuinely heartfelt and the humor does work despite how annoying I found Alan Arkin in Argo (2012). The reputation of the film has probably fallen in the eyes of critics but I think that is still able to charm with it's irreverent performances and the dark humor that the film is willing to interact with while not losing the sweetness that has to be at it's center. \n\nChainsmoking housewife Sheryl Hoover, Toni Collette, struggles to support her failing motivational speaker husband Richard, Greg Kinnear, heroin addicted father-in-law Edwin, Alan Arkin, aspiring beauty queen daughter Olive, Abigail Breslin, and her son Dwayne, Paul Dano, who has taken a vow of silence in an attempt to pressure his family into letting him become a pilot. Joining their family is her suicidal brother Frank, Steve Carrell, as they head off on a road trip to Redondo Beach in California for the Little Miss Sunshine pageant that Olive will be competing in. Along the way the family bonds as they face a lot of adversity and discover who they really are after supporting one another and accepting each other's flaws. After a tragic event Olive competes in the pageant but her performance shocks the judges and attendees and yet the family no longer care because they are comfortable with who they are.\n\nIt is the nice little touches, the family's car doesn't work so they have to push the van and then climb in one by one thus becoming a team of sorts that really sell you on the family dynamic and this film has so many of them that it is hard not to be charmed. I was moved when we finally see the prickly Dwayne speak after so long as he is unable to deal with the fact that he will not be able to be a pilot because he is color blind. The fact that his younger sister comforts him also warmed my heart because my own relationship with my brother, while often difficult, is what I would call close and supportive and the sight of a possible example of this sort of relationship was pleasant to witness on screen. Yes, the film could be called emotionally manipulative but what film is not? This film successfully emotionally manipulated me and I appreciate that because it shows that all professionals involved are skilled at what they do and deserve praise for their abilities.\n\nIt is the acting that often pulls the film through it's more mawkish moments as Collette and Kinnear are such bright talents that you can't help but be magnetized by them. From the moment we first see her we completely believe Collette as the slightly trashy, struggling to make it woman who holds all of these disparate people together and throughout the rest of the film Collette proves she has the talent to handle both comedy and drama. Kinnear brings a real sense of desperation to the role even as he attempts to mask it with overzealous fastidiousness and confidence. Rounding out the supporting cast Arkin gives a colorful supporting turn that clearly appealed to the more sentimental voters within the Academy, Carell displays an early flair for tragicomic roles and Dano is terrifically entertaining and relatable as the teenager who is uncomfortable in his own skin. Breslin is quite good as the child too as she plays her as a fully rounded character not just a charming little moppet and makes us feel as much affection for her as her on screen family do.\n\nI find that this a film that I can return to again and again and again because it draws me in every time with it's fantastic characters, quirky antics and the emotionally moving moments it produces. At the end of the film you really care about the characters you have invested over 100 minutes in and in terms of the Best Picture nominees of 2006, I am talking about Babel (2006), this is one of the few that really connects with me.",

To see these damaged people put aside all their struggles to fight for this singular goal might be one of the most charming and heartwarming things I have ever seen on film. It‚Äôs not an important goal, it will not fix any of the problems they are facing, but it matters to someone they all love so they fight for it. When this film started I never expected that I would be brought to tears at any point, but I was more than once. I‚Äôm only writing about the general themes now, and it‚Äôs almost making me tear up again. I guess I‚Äôm a sucker for a film that celebrates the dysfunctional love within family. A huge part of the success of Little Miss Sunshine is the cast. I could list all 6 names of the lead actors and expound upon how superb they were, but I‚Äôll save you the extra rambling. The point is that each one played their part perfectly. They all had moments when I loved them, was annoyed by them, or was able to laugh at them. It was magic how they all came together in such a wonderful way, and it‚Äôs one of those rare movies where I feel like I should applaud the Casting Directors. The characters have so many odd quirks that it seems like the kind of movie that would feel false. But the chemistry within the cast worked in a way that allowed me to see the heart of a real family underneath all of the wackiness. I‚Äôve talked extensively about the emotional core of Little Miss Sunshine, but I almost forgot to bring up the fact that it‚Äôs hilarious. I can‚Äôt count the number of times I laughed out loud while watching the movie, but it kept surprising me with more strong jokes. There was the constant physical gag of the bus they were driving, which never got old for me, but then each character had their own odd personality or struggle they were going through to keep the laughs coming. There is a fair amount of dark humor because suicide, drug use, and other vices are part of their lives. It‚Äôs kind of impressive how deftly they manage to treat those topics with respect, and also allow us to laugh at them. Slight spoilers for the end of the film: Perhaps the biggest struggle for me when it came to Little Miss Sunshine was the fact that we don‚Äôt get resolution on a number of the plot threads. In fact only one person in the movie gets any real closure. I was disappointed at first, because I like a mega-happy ending any day. However, upon reflection, I realized the movie wasn‚Äôt about each individual‚Äôs struggle and how they would survive. The whole point is that when the chips were down and they were facing failure, they all came together and accomplished the goal. So we don‚Äôt have to see them all overcome life‚Äôs hurdles, we just have to know that (as a family) they will make it through. That‚Äôs the magic of Little Miss Sunshine and why I‚Äôm still thinking about it days later.",

When there is no other place others wish to be and see thst it's not all bad in what we see or what others make us see when we have a chance. When the way we see life puts us in the spotlight in our hearts when we just enjoy seeing what we see, others happy when we are not to know they have chance to live a better life that is not like ours. When life is full of judges to see that we will encounter plenty of judges seeing us and pointing out what we don't see to see that we either got it or not. When we see that others have had enough of seeing and hearing the same things when it's all these girls got before they start seeing the real world. When we see some places are not what we see but what others see is us when we can judge as much as others in what we expect to see how our life should be. When we see life is full of their illusions to not get caught up in seeing the unreal. When we see others have seen enough when they are really good, have better chances then we do, when they see is seriously what they want to be, a winner. When what we see we don't want to see when we like seeing what we see and not what others wish to see to see we hold what best for others seeing. When we need to see things through for someone and ourselves to perform. When we don't see what others see when it's plain fun that makes us see things in a perspective that others see all wrong and serious. When others wish to keep a certain standards to things others wish seeing to see different is not welcome when trying to keep old traditions the same. When we see that others could use a boost when not many like seeing what we see but a few who hate seeing the same thing to see change. When what we like seeing is all of us together to stick together to only see ourselves the way we intended not others intend to see life is going to be okay as long as we stay away from places that are not meant for us. When we need to see the thing we no longer will see to see what really impacts us, influences us down the road that we carry a long through our life whether it's good or bad, it's just a matter what perspective you see it.",

We sat down with my granddaughters (oldest is 10 youngest is 6) Then is starts: Alan Arkin character shout up hate speech than a few minutes later loudly promising all life is better if you fu*k / screw and many girls as you can and do it all as you are young. After this 2nf outburst I pulled the movie out. I replaced it with some appropriate. I was so ticked off as I disappeared into the kitchen, I snapped the DVD in half and threw it into the garbage can: where garbage is put, right. People for this crap is: Jonathan Dayton , Valerie Faris and the writer, Michael Arndt. Also condemn the the money people and the worse. the morons here on Rotten Tomatoes. 91% likes...oh my lord, what a bunch of toads (or worse). Got to be the most ignorant set human tools. This movie is crap for our society and simply lowers everyone's IQ and honoring yourself and the people around us. Gut wrenching manure. Did I mention we hated it here?",

There's something the central characters decide to do that's completely out of nowhere, and doesn't fit the almost-ultra realistic tone of the rest of the film.\n\nBut, after I got over the ridiculousness of this one part of the film, I was able to return to concentrating on everything else. And I liked almost everything else. The cinematography is beautiful in a broken sort of way, the atmosphere is perfectly decided, and (above all else) the cast is phenomenal. The adults of the film are as great as they always are in everything they're in. And Abigail Breslin, who I don't think I've seen in anything else before, is absolutely an insane talent. She's real and she's funny, and she's√É¬¢?? so far beyond her years I have a hard time believing it. Or, I guess she WAS all those things. It's been ten years since this movie came out, things might have changed.\n\nAnd while I'm mentioning the cast, I really want to draw my focus to Paul Dano's performance. I've only started to really notice him in movies recently, and I'm surprised it's taken me this long. He's always fantastic, and I think he's outdone himself here. What could have been just another angsty teen character became so much more than that.\n\nIf it weren't for the stellar performances, I don't think I would've liked \"Little Miss Sunshine\" at all. Some of the jokes made me chuckle, but there were just so many clich√É√Ç (C)s, and that stupid ten minutes, I mentioned earlier, really is very stupid. But, again, the performances were very, VERY good, and that saved the film...\n\nActually, that pagent scene also majorly contributed to saving the film for me. Most indie dramedies have that whole \"the dysfunctional family is gonna be happily dysfunctional together\" moment, but this one was especially funny...\n\nAlso Steve Carell should have more awards.",

Nur: Das M√§dchen schaut gar nicht uns an. Sie starrt in einen Fernseher. Dort laufen Miss Wahlen und die Gewinnerin wird gerade gekr√∂nt. Das M√§dchen selbst befindet sich also bei den Proben. Sie will auch auf dem Podest gekr√∂nt werden. Little Miss Sunshine, das wird schnell deutlich, ist ein Film √ºber Tr√§ume. Und √ºber Illusionen. Einige Tage sp√§ter, nach einer merkw√ºrdigen Reise in einem alten VW Bus von Albuquerque (das liegt in New Mexico) nach Redondo Beach / Kalifornien setzt die Realit√§t ein. Vom Freeway aus sieht man das ziel der Reise - vor allem aber lernt man etwas √ºber die endlosen Strecken Kaliforniens und den amerikanischen Traum. Ein Traum, der √ºber Strassen f√ºhrt, die niemals enden. Ein Luftschloss. Little Miss Sunshine schliesst an die non-konformen Road Movies der fr√ºhen 70er an, die sich so gern √ºber den \"American Dream\" mockierten. Die Welt in Little Miss Sunshine ist eingeteilt in kleine Di√§tschritte, beruflichen Werdegang, √∂ffentliche Anerkennung - Erfolg, der alle menschlichen Sehns√ºchte dominiert. Die Hoover Familie, allen voran das M√§dchen Olive (Abigail Breslin), lebt in dieser Welt. Genauso ihr Vater Richard (Greg Kinnear), der davon besessen ist, zu gewinnen, da er den Triumph eines Sieges nie kennengelernt hat. Dann ist da der Grossvater, der den Wahnsinn der Jugend zelebriert (und Heroin schnieft). Onkel Frank (Steve Carell) schliesslich, hat gerade einen Selbstmordversuch f√ºr die Liebe √ºberlebt. Der Bruder Dwayne (Paul Dano) hat seit neun Monaten kein Wort gesprochen. nicht etwa, weil er depressiv ist, sondern Nietzsche J√ºnger. Dwayne hasst alles und jeden. Little Miss Sunshine wagt nun etwas Ungew√∂hnliches: Eingangs erleben wir ein Abendessen im Kreis der Hoovers - anschliessend wissen wir genau, wie diese Familie funktioniert. Dann gehts los: Road Trip! Eine geschliffenere Kom√∂die als die von Jonathan Dayton und Valerie Faris d√ºrfte wohl schwer zu finden sein! Little Miss Sunshine ist nicht nur ungeheuer witzig, sondern erz√§hlt auch die Wahrheit. Die Schauspieler - fantastisch! Allen voran Dano, der den Teenager, der nichts als ekel empfindet, mit leblosen schwarzen Augen verk√∂rpert. Carrell spielt einen mysteri√∂sen Mann, von tiefer Trauer umgeben. Umh√ºllt wie durch einen Schleier. Je weniger er sich darum zu bem√ºhen scheint, desto mehr m√ºssen wir √ºber seinen Onkel Frank lachen! Am besten seine Aussprache von Nietzsche: \"Nietscha\"! Der Niedergang eines Intellektuellen, der studiert hat und nunmehr in seine Einzelteile zerlegt wurde. Analyse, aber keine Gnade! Sehr lustig, vor allem aber eine authentische Charakter-Studie!",

            "content": "Little Miss Sunshine begins with Greg Kinnear's character stating that \"there are two kinds of people in this world: winners and losers.\" This sort of optimism assumes that life is in someway perfectible, and is the foundation the institutions in the Western world, but especially in the United States. The Protestant work ethic that is central to the American mythos states that it is hard work and discipline that guarantee one's salvation. Even divorced from its religious origins the American brand of capitalism still is based on the premise that anyone is capable of success if they work hard enough to achieve it. However this also has the effect of marginalizing those who do not succeed and compounds their misery by stating that their discomfort is deserved since they must be incompetent or unmotivated. Little Miss Sunshine chronicles a dysfunctional family's journey to get young Olive Hoover a victory at a child beauty pageant. Little Miss Sunshine challenges the modern notion of success as a path to happiness by providing audience with an alternative message: to find happiness even when losing. \n\nEach character strives to find a specific vision of success associated with certain ideologies or social roles. In the first two minutes of the film, the father of the household, Richard Hoover, pitches his self-help program, \"9 Steps to Success\", to an audience with unswerving reverence to the idea that \"there are two kinds of people in this world: winners and losers\" but that \"inside each and everyone... is a winner waiting to be awakened\". Richard in effect strives for the capitalist vision of success: not only is he an entrepreneur taking risks and willing to engage in competition to find success but the service he is trying to sell, motivational speaking, capitalizes on aspirations for self-improvement. Richard's conformist views are contrasted with his son's unorthodoxy. Dwayne envisions success as Friedrich Nietzsche imagined it: as an ubermench (in English it is often rendered as \"overman\"). Dwayne can be seen reading Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra in the opening sequence, he has a large portrait of Nietzsche in his bedroom and can even be seen wearing a shirt with \"Jesus was wrong\" written across; a reference to Nietzsche's quote \"God is dead\". Dwayne embodies the Dionysian spirit as he rejects the order thrust upon him by society as he despises the mundane life of his household and his determination to find glory surfaces in his constant exercise as a means of self-enhancement. He strives to join the Air Force Academy above all else, even keeping a vow of silence until he enters it and learns to fly over everyone else, literally become a person who is \"over man\". Sheryl Hoover at first glance embodies the ideal modern mother. She is the primary source of income for the family as Richard's life coach business is yet to take off and she also seems to have considerable influence over decision making in the household. She at the same time is a nurturing and open minded mother willing to explain difficult concepts to her daughter, Olive, such as suicide and homosexuality. Frank Ginsberg embodies intellectual success, as he is the self-proclaimed \"preeminent scholar\" of Marcel Proust. However the film reveals that upon inspection all the family members have trouble sustaining or attaining their success, causing them immense sadness and frustration.\n\nThis contrast is captured in the opening title sequence, which features Frank frowning, looking pale and sickly, and wearing a hospital gown in artificial and gloomy lighting juxtaposed with the title Little Miss Sunshine. Frank in spite of being on the surface very successful as a scholar is suicidal and \"deeply unhappy\" as he had a breakup with a younger man and in the resulting turmoil he lost his job, his title of preeminent Proust scholar and the affection of his ex-boyfriend to his rival. He reveals all of this to Olive while eating lunch with the rest of the family uncomfortably listening, allowing family tensions to surface revealing a family unit that is wholly dysfunctional. The uncomfortable discussion matter was juxtaposed with the warm sepia tones of the household and the bright natural lighting. The film challenges the other archetypes of success as well. The image of a kind hardworking mother gives way to Sheryl's barely contained frustration with the other members of the household. Sheryl is shown trying to sustain a strained relationship with her husband, Richard. Richard himself despite raving continually about success is projecting his insecurities because he is a failure as he doesn't have a stable job and instead of being a motivational speaker his speeches tend to be abrasive and preachy. It is only when his books were declared unpublishable that he hesitates to discuss success and because he ill-equipped to handle disappointment he starts becoming self-loathing and bitter for the remainder of the film. Dwayne is shown being dedicated and steadfast to his goal of flying aircraft but at the same time full of angst and anger. This is tension erupted when Dwayne discovered that he could not join the Air Force Academy as he is color blind and went berserk in the rear seat before screaming corrosive things to the rest of the family. All of these events capture the lack of fulfillment these ideologies or social roles have to offer those who subscribe to them. However the film makes the case that family, though imperfect, remedies disappointment through empathy and shared affection. The cheery sunlit hues that omnipresent in the film gives an atmosphere of cheeriness that incongruent with the obscene and sometimes dreadfully depressing moments in the story, but at the same time it highlights the idea of contentment and acceptance.\n\n\tThis tension between what society expects from the individual and what the individual desires is played out most spectacularly in Olive. Watching beauty pageants on television it is clear that society expects young girls like Olive to aspire to meet certain standards of beauty. However, Olive unlike most in the rest of her family is driven not primarily by success but by happiness. When given the choice between eating chocolate ice cream and staying thin for her performance at the child beauty pageant, Olive chooses to eat the ice cream because it makes her happy. The film makes her to be ideal girl as she shows no fault in her behavior for majority of the movie as she wasn't seen bickering with the rest of the family and the most troubling events are averted with her expressing her affection for others. However the child beauty pageant is filled with participants that are over sexualized even as children as most put on spray tan, lip-gloss and are extremely thin. Olive, completely ordinary for her age group, is made to feel abnormal when compared to the rest of the participants. However, Olive then satirizes the event by starting a strip tease, as children are allowed to be sexualized in ways that conform to the pageant's taste but overtly sexual themes such as strip teasing demystifies the underlying sexual nature of the event. Olive also chose what made her happy in spite of being kicked out of the event and with her family cheering her on and congratulating her on the way home, accepting her as she chooses to be.\n\n\tLittle Miss Sunshine reminds its audience that it is not necessary to find success to find happiness, and that the many of the visions of success given to us by society are often not worth having to begin with or worth defining self-worth through.\n\nReferences:\nLittle Miss Sunshine.

            "content": "2006 gave moviegoers some great films, but out of nowhere an indie film took moviegoers by surprise and managed to achieve an insane level of hype for an independent movie: The tragicomedy \"Little Miss Sunshine\". \nWe follow the Hoover family, an extremely dysfunctional family that consists of a stay-at-home mother, a narcissistic and control freak father, a junkie and sex-obsessed grandfather, a rebellious teenager who doesn't speak, a homosexual and suicidal uncle, and an innocent young girl who dreams of becoming a beauty queen. When the girl is accepted in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest, the family begins a road trip. \nConsidering that this was the first indie film I ever saw, I guess that this is a special movie for me as it was the one film that made me realize that cinema goes beyond Hollywood and their big budgets, and oddly enough I remembered several sections of it. \"Little Miss Sunshine\" counts with hilarious dialog, solid performances that go form hilarious to extremely touching, the ensemble cast is one of the best I have seen on a comedy, larger than life characters that are memorable and each of them have a distinct personality and character arc, a clever script from a then newcomer writer, a plot that is not about the destination (which is just a ridiculously meaningless McGuffin) but about the journey, hilarious scenes, a perfect dramatic dose (there are scenes that will genially make you feel for these characters), a shocking ending that will undeniably polarize audiences (some will find it hilarious, others will be offended), a beautiful family theme that's hidden under well written comedy, a confident direction by directing duo Dayton-Faris, a perfect use of its running time, and the chemistry between the cast is downright incredible.\n\"Little Miss Sunshine\" is one of the funniest and touching comedies you can find. It is smartly written, confidently directed, and marvelously acted. In my opinion, this is in the top 5 films of 2006 (along with \"Children of Men\", \"The Departed\", \"Pan¬¥s Labyrinth\", and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\"). A must see if you love comedies or are into indie filmmaking.",

I wanted to know more about each family member. This is a fantastic performance by all of the actors. You should expect a serious comedy, with a deep message at heart. The ending of the movie--spoiler coming--is as inspiring as reading through the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. A rebellion to the superficiality, patriarchy, and hypocrisy of beauty pageants (or just society in general?) all the family members reunited around Olive to dance to \"super freak.\"--What a wonderful story, great acting (Steve Carrel is good doing a \"serious\" role) and an empowering ending.

Each of them are likable in their own way and possess qualities that the others lack, which makes you really care about what is going on throughout the movie. There were many great things about this film but what I feel made it stand out was the unique ending. I won't spoil it but I'll just say that it gave a great message which was to not rely on the affirmation of others to be happy with who you are. Overall this film did a great job of making a multi-layered, outlandish plot seem completely realistic and normal, while drawing you in with great dialogue and character development.",

I can tell this was written in a very attentive manner and filmed in a very alluring way. I just feel very happy after watching this film. The cast is what works so great in this film. Every cast member is given a respectful time to give us a view of their personalities. If you are smart you can easily pick out what each character represent, the girl is a dreamer, grandpa is love, uncle is envy and so on. The directors did an astounding job on that. This film also has a perfect balance to itself which not a lot of comedies do now a days. It's perfectly blended with comedy, seriousness and sadness. It has it's fair shares of sensible humor, intense seriousness and heartbreaking sadness. No joke was forced. Which isn't present in a lot of comedies. I am very good at seeing the ending \"from a mile away\" which for this I THOUGHT I did. But nope...writers are just that good! I can't help it to think that they knew already that people would be expecting that and if the ending had been this perfect little circle I would have not liked the film as much because isn't the end what we all look forward to...to see what happens. So the conclusion was very well done a little over the top but a feel good one. One concealed talent was Steve Carell. I mean that guy can pull of any role.\nAnd him and alan were my favorites in this film. Carell will always finds ways to impress. He is truly splendid. This is probably one of my favorite films of all time. Overall...well there is no need. My review is enough. Watch it! You won't regret it!",

The film is incredibly entertaining and fun in every way. The cast is so fun and enjoyable it's really hard to not love them. The cast is incredibly talented and I loved all of them in this movie. Little Miss Sunshine had a really fun story of a little girl who won (by default) the Little Miss Sunshine contest and gets to go to California for the finals. Throughout the movie the family of misfits gets in their broken down yellow van and encounters many mishaps along the way. The film is really a lot of things. It's a drama, a comedy, an adventure and kind of depressing at times really. The depressing parts mainly involving Frank but it's not distracting or anything. The family all kind of learns from this trip and get to know really each other better on their journey. The dad who at first was kinda stubborn and selfish turned into a family man, Dwayne turned into a happier guy, Frank learned to enjoy life more, and Alan Arkin didn't really learn a ton but he was memorable hehe. There are many really heartfelt moments in the movie that made me really like the movie such as the talk between Olive and Grandpa, the scene when (spoiler!) the grandpa passes, Dwayne learning he's colorblind, and the scene where they all dance together. To add on top of everything it was really funny. Alan Arkin was hysterical! The only thing that could've helped in the movie is if the pageant scene was a bit longer, I feel like there could've been more they can do. Little Miss Sunshine had a lot of moral lessons, it was funny, dramatic, cute, and powerful even. The cast was great and so was the movie. B+",

This film never sugarcoats its darker elements, while never overshadowing the heart that underlies the whole story.

Their car breaks down and the mechanic tells them they get get the thing running by getting the car to go at least 20 MPH. Okay, fine. How do they achieve this?

With great casting (Greg Kinnear has never had a better role) and a wonderful soundtrack checking off the rest of the boxes, Little Miss Sunshine's looks don't deceive and the quality shines through.",

            "content": "I have a tendency to like dramedies even if their flaws are abundantly clear. Little Miss Sunshine is one of those dramedies that contain no flaws, at least in my opinion. I enjoyed the hell out of this film the first time I watched it and just as much the next few times.\n\nThe film is written by Michael Arndt, and this was his first adapted screenplay. This man knows how to make a story that is emotional and at the same time subtly funny, which is probably the main reason he was brought in to do Toy Story 3. He has created this dysfunctional family filled with personalities that clearly don't mesh with one another and they have to be together in order to bring Olive, the daughter, to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The film focuses on this family who are clearly not very successful in either their career, family, or even their life, and their burdens have caused dysfunction within the family. This is something that I can easily empathise as everyone, at least, at some point has had dysfunction in their own homes. The film itself is kind of a message in telling us to keep trying in achieving our ambitions, and don't give up just because the journey is hard.\n\nThis is directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and this is their first feature film. A fantastic way to start their career in feature films, before they were just doing music videos and documentaries. The film has a small budget and maybe that is one reason this film couldn't do more spectacular moments, aside from the pageant but with what they did, they did great. Dayton and Faris has created a film that is very cramped emphasising on each member's personality and struggles. Most of the film is shot inside the VW bus and because we see the bus in a lot of the film, it becomes a character of it's own. This film does similarly look like the low budget films that are commonly found at festivals like Sundance but it's strong script and simple direction makes this film a gem.\n\nLike I said before, the film feels like a low budget film and looks like what a dramedy should look. It looks engaging and accessible while at the same time feeling very intimate and simple. The DP of this film is Time Suhrstedt who commonly does a lot of romantic comedies, comedies and dramedies like \"Office Space\" and \"The Wedding Singer\"; he also did the photography of a couple of personal favorites of mine \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" and \"Fantasia 2000\". The film doesn't try to look amazing but there are moments, like the first 5 minutes of the film, where shots look beautiful, though only a handful.\n\nWhen I come into a film like this, I expect a fantastic soundtrack that dominates the film rather than the composer's score. Little Miss Sunshine has a great soundtrack, just not as abundant as I thought it would be but I think that it's a good thing as it would have distracted me from the little things in scenes. Though the track that plays in the climax is unexpected and hilarious. The score though in this film is great, it fits well with the tone and feels very hopeful and positive.\n\nThis film has an amazing ensemble cast which work well together and looks very convincing in their role. Steve Carrell took me by surprise in particular as I generally see him as an over top actor but he convinced me here that he can play something serious. Paul Dano was another actor which I liked in this film a lot as most of his acting is played through facial expressions, and that particular scene where he breaks is just phenomenal. Kinnear, Collette, Arkin and Breslin were also great in this film. The cast feels like a real dysfunctional family, and each one feels realistic and none feel cheesy or over the top.\n\nThe film feels very heartwarming and is easy to digest. It's a fantastic dramedy about a family that makes you think about your own and how similar it may seem. The film shows us the importance in trying and not giving up, because only losers give up.",

Beside the struggling the familiy still decide to insert Olive to the beauty event which will cost them more. The trendmark of this movie is yellow VW car in the cover which they use for travel from his hometown to the town which held contest. for the moment you will think you watch horror movie because the feeling,sensation and tense is similar. this movie will make you mumbling, laughing and upset. it can play our emotion and feeling. it`s like we are part of the familiy even you will feel shame and oppressed too. there is only few movie can do that. very recommend movie.

            "content": "I have a tendency to like dramedies even if their flaws are abundantly clear. Little Miss Sunshine is one of those dramedies that contain no flaws, at least in my opinion. I enjoyed the hell out of this film the first time I watched it and just as much the next few times.\n\nThe film is written by Michael Arndt, and this was his first adapted screenplay. This man knows how to make a story that is emotional and at the same time subtly funny, which is probably the main reason he was brought in to do Toy Story 3. He has created this dysfunctional family filled with personalities that clearly don't mesh with one another and they have to be together in order to bring Olive, the daughter, to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. The film focuses on this family who are clearly not very successful in either their career, family, or even their life, and their burdens have caused dysfunction within the family. This is something that I can easily empathise as everyone, at least, at some point has had dysfunction in their own homes. The film itself is kind of a message in telling us to keep trying in achieving our ambitions, and don't give up just because the journey is hard.\n\nThis is directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris and this is their first feature film. A fantastic way to start their career in feature films, before they were just doing music videos and documentaries. The film has a small budget and maybe that is one reason this film couldn't do more spectacular moments, aside from the pageant but with what they did, they did great. Dayton and Faris has created a film that is very cramped emphasising on each member's personality and struggles. Most of the film is shot inside the VW bus and because we see the bus in a lot of the film, it becomes a character of it's own. This film does similarly look like the low budget films that are commonly found at festivals like Sundance but it's strong script and simple direction makes this film a gem.\n\nLike I said before, the film feels like a low budget film and looks like what a dramedy should look. It looks engaging and accessible while at the same time feeling very intimate and simple. The DP of this film is Time Suhrstedt who commonly does a lot of romantic comedies, comedies and dramedies like \"Office Space\" and \"The Wedding Singer\"; he also did the photography of a couple of personal favorites of mine \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" and \"Fantasia 2000\". The film doesn't try to look amazing but there are moments, like the first 5 minutes of the film, where shots look beautiful, though only a handful.\n\nWhen I come into a film like this, I expect a fantastic soundtrack that dominates the film rather than the composer's score. Little Miss Sunshine has a great soundtrack, just not as abundant as I thought it would be but I think that it's a good thing as it would have distracted me from the little things in scenes. Though the track that plays in the climax is unexpected and hilarious. The score though in this film is great, it fits well with the tone and feels very hopeful and positive.\n\nThis film has an amazing ensemble cast which work well together and looks very convincing in their role. Steve Carrell took me by surprise in particular as I generally see him as an over top actor but he convinced me here that he can play something serious. Paul Dano was another actor which I liked in this film a lot as most of his acting is played through facial expressions, and that particular scene where he breaks is just phenomenal. Kinnear, Collette, Arkin and Breslin were also great in this film. The cast feels like a real dysfunctional family, and each one feels realistic and none feel cheesy or over the top.\n\nThe film feels very heartwarming and is easy to digest. It's a fantastic dramedy about a family that makes you think about your own and how similar it may seem. The film shows us the importance in trying and not giving up, because only losers give up.",

There are some implausible moments that occur just to move the plot along, but again, it's a comedy at heart, so there's bound to be moments where suspension of disbelief is necessary. It also carries a strong message about how society perceives self-image and the power of family, despite many obstacles that can get in the way of that.",

            "content": "Interesting film, but NOT a comedy\n\n\nIMO, this is a well-made, well-acted film, but with a lingering aftertaste of sadness, not humor.\n\nNearly every main character has their life's dream shattered, usually with acute humiliation/embarrassment heaped on for good measure. That COULD have been made to be funny, but wasn't... unless your idea of fun is watching someone accidentally cut off a few fingers with a power saw. These people have way too much at stake, in desperate, edgy lives, for me to be comfortable laughing at their anguish. Played as broad farce, with characters so overblown and self-involved we could enjoy their come-uppance, it might be okay,\n\nbut seeing these poor devils repeatedly denied even the smallest shred of dignity, cuts a little too close to the bone.\n\nOne of the saddest moments is watching little Olive look at her plump, perfectly normal child's body in the dressing-room mirror... as she wonders if there's something wrong with her. Life being what it is, it's certainly not the last time she's going to do that.\n\nA reviewer at Rottentomatoes calls this a two-hour version of that old Blind Melon music video (with the girl in the bee costume). Would that we could believe it were true, that she'll find happiness and acceptance, in her own uniqueness, and others to share it with. But the final dance her family joins her in is not some carefree expression of oddball joy... it's a desperate attempt to save her from humiliation, at the hands of people so deluded, they've turned their own little girls into a pedophile's walking wet dream. You have to know it's only a temporary reprieve, the world will find a way to get at her again, soon enough.\n\nIt bothers me a bit that foul-mouthed, porn-addicted Grandpa, is the one who chose her song and dance. Even played for laughs in the family living room, it's a queasy sort of entertainment. It turns out to be just the right note, for the pageant... but that doesn't make it any more appropriate for Olive.\n\nI feel for these guys, but I don't like watching them much. They're all balanced on a knife-edge of despair. Only in trying to protect the child do they momentarily escape their own personal hells. And somehow, together, they manage to get that bus rolling down the road, one more time...\n\nThey have no choice, if they ever want to make it home.",

There are some movies I watch that I just don't care about so I don't really write a review about it. But there are some that I just have to review or write about because it?s been lingering in my mind for a while. My reviews are also quite long and they take a lot of time to write. I need to get all my thoughts and feelings of the movie out in my review, and that takes some time. SO, what I've decided to do is write dual double reviews. These are reviews that are short and to the point and they don?t really take that long. Plus, I write another short and quick review for another movie that sort of corresponds with the first review. I won?t be doing this a lot. If there is a movie which is really on my mind, then I?ll write a long and in depth review about it, but if I just want to tell you my opinions quicker then I?ll write a review for two movies. It?s basically like two for the price of one. (This all sounds very professional and crap, as if I am important in your choice for movies, but I?m not trying to sound stuck up or important; I just want you to read my reviews and enjoy them. If you don?t want to then don?t, because these reviews aren?t really that good anyway.) So, my first choices for my double dual reviews are: Little Miss Sunshine and Boogie Nights. \r\n   \r\n  Little Miss Sunshine is a satirical comedy drama about a very dysfunctional family that?s trying to get half way across the country so they can put their daughter in a beauty pageant. This film has a great cast with a very unique ensemble of characters. Steve Carrel is a gay, suicidal man trying to recover for his dark thoughts. Abigail Breslin is an energetic and cute little girl who wants to fulfill her dreams as a beauty star. Paul Dano is a depressed, silent teenage boy who hates his family and wants to fly airplanes for a living. Greg Kinnear is a failing motivational speaker who only cares about winning and is the father and head of the household. Toni Collete is the mother and she is just trying to keep the family happy and in order. And finally, last but not least, Alan Arkin is the foul-mouthed, drug addicted grandpa who doesn't really give a crap about anything or anyone except himself. So what happens when you get all these characters and put them into a yellow van to travel across the country? Let?s just say, some sh*t happens. \r\n   \r\n  The acting is really good in LMS. Steve Carrel I think gives his finest performance I've ever seen. Abigail Breslin is cute but also emotional at points. Paul Dano is fantastic and just so intriguing as a character to watch. Greg Kinnear is really convincing as a doucebag and I really did hate him for a while.  Toni Collete is probably the only weak point in the cast for the film. She really doesn?t stand out and I didn?t really care for her at all. She was only there to maintain a bit of happiness, but all she really did was come off as annoying to me. Alan Arkin is probably the best part about the movie. He was just so funny and he seemed so natural as his character. The writing is funny at points and the direction pulls off a lighthearted and joyful touch. But, there were some huge problems with the film which bothered me. One being Alan Arkin?s short screen time. (SPOILER ALERT) I felt that they killed off Arkin?s character to early in the film. His death was a big surprise, but I couldn?t feel for the old guy because I didn?t get to understand or know his character that well.  I didn?t feel any remorse or sorrow for his death at all. Plus, with all the lightheartedness throughout the movie, I couldn?t take his death seriously at all. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that the family basically got over his death in two hours and everything was the same again. That wasn?t realistic and I felt it was stupid. Plus, about ten minutes later we find out that Paul Dano?s character is freaking color blind and no one gives a crap. I didn?t even care at all because we just got finished with the grandpa?s death and now we should feel for the teenager also?!That?s too much and I didn?t fall for it. (SPOILER OVER) I didn?t? really understand how some of the characters were and whether we should like some of them or not. I felt that Kinnear?s character was a doucebag at points and at other points he wasn?t. I didn?t know if Steve Carrel?s character was really smart or just knew random facts for the heck of it. Plus both these characters hatred each other for no reason and we never find out why. The film?s resolution was underwhelming and by the end there wasn?t really a change in the characters or plot. Overall, I think the movie was a bit bland and it left me cold. Although I enjoyed the acting (even if Alan Arkin didn?t do that great of a job) and lighthearted direction, there wasn?t enough comedy and emotion to keep me satisfied with the film. \r\n\r\nRecommendation: It?s not for everyone (it wasn?t really for me), but Little Miss Sunshine will definitely please hard core satirical comedy fans and some movie lovers alike.\r\n\r\nCheck out my Boogie Nights review!: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/890753/reviews/?search=Boogie+Nights",

            "content": "Little Miss Sunshine is about a screwed up, messed up, and overall challenged family who go on the road and discover a trip that lets them realize their true dreams rather than what they really want. It's a nice, sweet sort of film, but not without its flaws. It shows how the family life can go from dysfunctional, to maybe happy, but in the end truly a cliche just hidden under great characters and well done direction. Little Miss Sunshine boasts an excellent cast, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin, and Steve Carell being standouts in my opinion. It's an honest, down to earth film, but it lacks the reality of how everyday family problems are like, throwing in situations that aren't very relatable, such as going mute or cutting yourself because your gay lover left you. Dark comedies are usually like this though, but only a few scenes in this film are actually dark, and the rest is more problematic, something that feels like it spurred from a lighter, more simple version of Raising Arizona. It has a perfect length, but movies like this seem built for the festival circuit, even though they are good, and not as much for the theatrical big screen.\r\n\r\n   Little Miss Sunshine is written by Michael Arndt, and directed by the Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Farris couple team. It follows a family with a lot of issues, ones that can't and ones that can be solved, as they get on the road to take their youngest member all the way to California to get her in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. First thing is first, I felt the dialogue in the film was well-done, but rather the plot was weak. The dark comedic situations they got into were funny, but they were few and far between, and I felt I had either read or heard this kind of plot before. I'm pretty sure I have indeed seen or watched something where a family must go and spend time somewhere and learn how they can become better to themselves and to each other. It was a generic plot, one I didn't very much enjoy, but found myself slightly intrigued in to. The dialogue, though, was funny at times, and it was heartwarming and moving and inspirational, as well. Michael Arndt writes a screenplay that is enjoyable, but with a plot that's not as much, and one that seems very cliche. Not Oscar worthy screenplay, one that is appreciative, but not Oscar worthy.\r\n\r\n   The direction, though, in this film was indeed Oscar-worthy, but the Academy didn't think so, as it snubbed Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Ferris for their solid work and well-done, simple take to the script on the big screen. Almost any other director would've given this film a goofy, serious tone I think, but it all depends on the true directors who make an amazing film. I wish they had made other films as successful, but the problem with Hollywood is that the industry doesn't condone comedy directors as much as the comedy writers. A film such as this should've received directing accolades, for the moment the first shot came on screen, I believed the direction was excellent. Comedy is as much about tone and timing as it is the acting and script, and today, comedy directors barely get the recognition they deserve. The writer for Monty Python should've got an Oscar nomination, but so should've the director, for without him the way the film feels and is as important as the material within. Little Miss Sunshine has one the most notable direction I've seen in a while, and everything about it should point to Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Ferris's great direction.\r\n\r\n   The acting was also very well done, with Steve Carrel and Paul Dano taking the cake for the best performances. Alan Arkin also gave a humorous performance, although I do not believe he should've won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Paul Dano plays a \"mute\", and a very convincing portrayal of a teen and his desire for success and his pain. Steve Carell was very funny, although he didn't bring as much comedy as he did awkwardness, which is as good for me. Abigail Breslin gives a good performance as an innocent girl and her want for success, while her father plays a douchebag who spreads the word of winning and not losing. The whole cast is stand out, with Greg Kinnear standing out as the best for me. His performance was mean and stand out as well as funny. He's utterly satisfying to see on screen, and his portrayal of a salesman who struggles is also excellent. The only problem with the characters is that they try to add an emotional touch and feel to the film, where overall it fails for me. I didn't feel to attached to anyone in the movie, and if one of them dies, I didn't actually care. Still, it was a good cast, one of the best I've seen in a dark comedy.\r\n\r\n   In the end, Little Miss Sunshine was intriguing, but flawed in a generic script and plot. The ending was all of a sudden, as if it just happened, and not pleasing to me. I thought the cast was great, and they brought great humor to the entire project, but that was really only the great part of the film. It was heartwarming as well, but it could've been better if the script wasn't so generic. The direction was also excellent and very, very good. All in all, Little Miss Sunshine is simple, memorable, but generic and cliche, with a mixed message to send, but a great cast that attempts to send it. 6/10.",

I just adore this film for so many reasons, but first and foremost being the fact that this film features one of the most real families I have seen in film, while still maintaining certain defined characters. I was so moved by how realistic this family plays off of each other and how caring they are about each other regardless of the events that take course in the family. Besides this, the film is of course, really funny in many scenes, thanks to many of the performances (everyone will find a favorite, but I in particular love Alan Arkin who deservedly won an Oscar for his performance here). The characters are not only real, but relate-able, and just about everybody can find a character they can identify themselves with. The situations are funny, the drama is very genuine, and the mechanics of the family are near flawless, if not entirely so. As I said, the performances are very strong, I in particular loved Arkin, Paul Dano, and Steve Carell, but all of them do a tremendous job with their respective roles.The soundtrack helps with the mood in many ways, and helps to set what scenes convey which emotion. Now the film also does a great job both bringing everything together, as well as tying everything from throughout the film into the plot in some way, which I always love. It may not overtly resolve all of the issues by the film's end, but you feel as if it emotionally pays off by the end, and you feel that while not overt, all of the issues seem to be resolved, in some cases more obvious then others. As for how the shots are composed, I think it's fine, some standout shots here and there. Really though, the reason I love this film so much is the family dynamic, and how well written the film is, and just how it uses everything to compose an altogether brilliant family drama that I can do nothing less than love because it is just such an amazingly fun, dramatic film that knows how to balance everything that it wants to out in a great way. I don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen it yet, but if you haven't, I say you should definitely give it a watch, it's just one Hell of a fantastic film.",

Great cast although I admit that I somehow had the urge to punch Richard in the face because he kept on saying the wrong things from the first half of the film. I mean how sure can this character be a motivational speaker although he is trying hard to be one? Sometimes winners and losers don't just sum up the people, the society as a whole of making life as a competition, it's all about being true to yourself and being able to accept things whole-heartedly good or bad. The film is sort of depressing too and also has its touching, warm family moments. Be aware of strong language though. To conclude, it's a satisfactory watch. This is a family-themed movie worth watching. A++.",

Little Miss Sunshine is a film about a not so happy family taking to the road to accompany their daughter to a beauty pageant. The ultimate message would seem a little clich√©, 'be yourself no matter what'. Yet, the screenplay is so cleverly written, and the performances seem so genuine that it's hard not to fall for its charm. Furthermore, the film's deadpan comedy conceals some original dramatic depth, while the character development recalls a more compelling type of European films.",

At first it may seem like something you wouldn't want to watch, especially at the beginning of the movie, but it gets better and better as it goes on. I honestly think the breakthrough scene with Dwayne was one of the most detailed and understanding  viewpoints of teen angst that I've ever witnessed from an adult, as adult directors typically butcher anything of the like. There were several scenes that were awkward or weird, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. Overall a great movie.\n\nTL;DR...Great movie; 4/5",

It's truly the ultimate story of a wacky family that just loves each other and sticks together. If nothing else the climax of the film when Olive performs at the pageant just might become an instant classic moment in film history and will have you laughing to tears.
