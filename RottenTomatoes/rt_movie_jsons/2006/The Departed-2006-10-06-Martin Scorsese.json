            "content": "\"The Departed\" is a gripping crime thriller that explores the dark underbelly of the Boston underworld. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film boasts an all-star cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson, who deliver some of their best performances.\n\nThe film follows two young men, Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Damon), who are both deeply embedded in the criminal underworld of Boston. Billy is an undercover cop working to take down the ruthless gangster Frank Costello (Nicholson), while Colin is a member of Costello's inner circle who has infiltrated the police department.\n\nAs the two men struggle to maintain their cover, they become increasingly entangled in a deadly game of cat and mouse, with each trying to outwit the other. Meanwhile, the body count continues to rise, and tensions escalate as the FBI and the Boston police department race to bring down Costello's criminal empire.\n\nThe performances in \"The Departed\" are nothing short of outstanding. DiCaprio is particularly impressive as Billy Costigan, delivering a powerful and nuanced portrayal of a man struggling with his own morality as he tries to take down a criminal mastermind. Damon is equally strong as the smooth-talking Colin, who seems to have it all but is ultimately undone by his own greed and ambition. Nicholson, meanwhile, is a force to be reckoned with as the sadistic Costello, bringing a palpable sense of danger to every scene he's in.\n\nScorsese's direction is masterful, expertly building tension and keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The film is unrelenting in its intensity, with every twist and turn leaving the viewer reeling.\n\nOverall, \"The Departed\" is a must-see film that delivers on every level. It's a thrilling crime drama that features some of the best performances of the past decade, and it's sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who sees it.",

            "content": "One of the greatest final shots to a film ever!\n\nWhat do you get when you include the cops in your usual Martin Scorsese gangster drama flicks? You get The Departed. Now, the plot of the film is pretty simple, there are two guys who've been planted into the police force and into an irish mob and both of them are working for the other side, that is, they are rats. This playing the part of rats leads to a film that is so amazing, you sometimes question yourself as to why is this film so good to watch?\n\nFirst off all, right of the bat, the performances in the film are all flawless. Not even a single loose thread. Leonardo, Matt, Jack (The Powerhouse). Alec, Mark (he's probably my favourite among them all) everyone is so good it's mind-boggling. Leonardo plays the most troubled character in the film and he displays every emotion that is needed masterfully, Matt Damon plays the character who has to act like he's a good guy but in actuality isn't and he does it with skill, I always had a smug when I saw him on-screen because of the steps he took to hide his identity. Jack Nicholson though, brings a powerhouse performance here. I am actually surprised why he didn't win an oscar for this because this here is a definitive performance. The only scene necessary for the academy to give him an award is when he imitates a \"gnawing, cheese-eating, f**king rat\". Mark Wahlberg is probably my favourite amongst this entire roster of talent because his character's just got this style and charisma which I instantly grew a liking towards. You don't wanna get into a fight with or disobey orders from this guy because he will fuck you up.\n\nThe editing in this film is something I really liked. Being a video editor myself, I would actually study this film several times to understand how to tell a story this complicated with such ease to an audience. The story arcs of both the leads are shown with the help of cross cuts and intercuts which really helps the audience to see how both of them are on similar pathways and what each of them is feeling at certain moments is just brilliant.\n\nThe score provided for this film and the music that has been used in certain sections is also something that works wonders. The particular use of Shipping Up To Boston by the Dropkick Murphys in this film is just brilliant. The song is literally on loop right now as I'm writing this.\n\nOverall, this film is just a blast to watch because of the story and its characters. And ofcourse, there are several of those trademark Martin Scorsese Unexpected moments sprinkled here and there throughout the film which take the intensity of the film up a notch.\n\nTo finish I'd like to say that the genius of this film is that you know both sides of the story and yet you just feel that tension getting cranked up with each passing minute.",

It tackles moral and religious themes, as two people are corrupted by the lives they choose to be a part of, showing that crime and evil hurts everyone. It's brought to life by an all-star cast, led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Mark Wahlberg gives a career-best performance in a supporting role and Jack Nicholson steals every scene he's in. Vera Farmiga and Martin Sheen are great too. I'm glad this film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing, giving Scorsese the recognition he deserved. I find myself saying this about a lot with his films, but this is another classic.",

Still, the big problem was the ending with the elevator scene more slapstick than shocking which quickly defused all the tension that was simmering.

Leonardo DiCaprio is the kid who grows up rough around the edges but ultimately is the most purely \"good\" character in the film and the real cop whereas in stark contrast is Matt Damon who was brought up under the wing of a well-known syndicate leader in the Irish mafia. Damon who is purely corrupt and an informant for his up-bringer Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) appears as the aspiring and hardworking cop when in reality he is a rat for the mob. The film is best in it's hard-talking interactions between the cops and mafia members with some of the best coming from Baldwin and Wahlberg in their supporting roles.      The film is smartly written and it's characters are well fleshed out and complex and the story is engrossing and captivating for the viewer. There is heavy language throughout and some very violent killings and other acts of violence, standard practice for most of Scorsese's filmography, and should only seen by adult audiences and those comfortable with the adult content.

After watching the film, you get a feel that it's for real, meaning\u2014it is realistic that the main characters die because right from the very start, they have just tricked each other.\n\n\nWhile the movie title is perhaps stating the obvious\u2014the word \"departed\" there connotes another sense. \"Departed\"\u2014as in the sense of the dead, thus the phrase \"our faithful departed\"\u2014rather translates into a more sensible meaning of isolation, since every mobster or law enforcer there\u2014and the ones caught in between [Caprio and Damon]\u2014seems to be rallying for his own cause, advancing his own cause, sadly solitarily.\n\n\nEach is trying to penetrate another man's territory\u2014that inevitably the movie climaxes at the part when the \"mole\" or the \"rat,\" who makes a lot of trouble between the outlaws and the pursuers cannot just be easily caught\u2014so confused their characters are they are that they end up pursuing and killing each other. They all end up being isolated. They, indeed, end up departed. Abandoned.\n\nScorsese's film provides us similar insights into the present-world realities. The whole drama in this piece spells out man's isolation which is deeply rooted in his self-interest, if not outright egotism.",

Of course, this was Scorsese's long overdue first Best Picture Oscar; and whilst it's not Raging Bull, there's still so much to enjoy here. The parallelism between various sets of characters is brilliantly established; I loved on this rewatch noticing the many camera pivots around the 180-degree line emphasising shifting perspectives and loyalties. The performances (even Jack Nicholson is reigned in a little) and technical craft are near faultless, and Scorsese guides us through a complex plot with elegantly constructed ease. It's not perfect - we really do need more than one female character with agency and significance, and it does lack something of a sense of place. It may not have the moral or intellectual depth of some of his work, but it still leaves you with that giddy, satisfied feeling of being in the hands of master story-teller in a film of such propulsive momentum that you barely notice the long running time. And that is not a small thing.",

            "content": "Let the rats scurry.\n\nCrossed encounters and rampant corruption lead director Martin Scorsese's popular crime thriller The Departed (2006). Scorsese weaves an intricate web of deception like the characters that are plants in The Departed with shots set up to distract you away from suspicious characters. It's no wonder why everyone who watches The Departed walks away from it blown away as the twists and reveals continue to astonish as Scorsese shoots and kills his way through his incredible cast.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio gives the greatest performance here as an honest cop named Billy Costigan Jr., who truly wants to change Boston to have less crime. In all his decency, he goes undercover and DiCaprio's face when witnessing mob murders is priceless. You see all his shock, horror, and pain as he's conflicted on what to do in a basically helpless position for over a year. DiCaprio proves he can play a tough hero with a sensitive kindness and warm empathy. Vera Farmiga has real romantic chemistry with DiCaprio, understandably. She's really breathtakingly gorgeous in The Departed as this foolish shrink Dr. Madolyn Madden, blind to her love's treachery. You feel all her frustrations and see where she's missing the mark of her characterizations of these various nefarious men.\n\nMatt Damon is a true blue scumbag rat Staff Sergeant Colin Sullivan  in The Departed. You see how this little prick is influenced by Jack Nicholson's Irish mob boss Frank Costello through charisma and money. Damon plays his crooked cop with a nervousness that feels so real as he's questioned and tries to undermine the investigations into Nicholson. Meanwhile, Nicholson is chewing the scenery with his cruel and menacing jerk crime lord, who threatens and tosses aside his own men like they are nothing. Nicholson's crude and abrupt jokes are so shocking and entertaining as you can tell Nicholson is having a blast insulting every character and running the show.\n\nMark Wahlberg is surprisingly effective as this awful Boston Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam with his crude remarks and endless belittling comments with Wahlberg's realistic bluntness and mean spirited command. Martin Sheen is interesting as the ineffective head of the undercover unit Captain Oliver Charles Queenan with an earnest and thoughtful performance. Ray Winstone is mighty and fearsome as Nicholson's evil henchman and hitman Arnold \"Mr. Frenchy\" French. Anthony Anderson is here as the funny and stupid cop on the force Trooper Brown. Alec Baldwin is excellent as the powerful head of Damon's detective group Captain George Ellerby with his funny offhand remarks and fierce delivery.\n\nBrad Pitt was right to produce The Departed. Writers William Monahan, Alan Mak, Felix Chong, and Man-Keung create this perilous crime narrative that judges all rats and asks the audience is the crime and deception in these professions worth the risk. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker effortlessly cuts from cop murders and gang killings with her classic slick style. The Departed is a massive 151 minutes and feels half that length to me. It's so fast paced as it blasts through tense conversation after conversation wherein anyone can be killed. \n\nCinematographer Michael Ballhaus finds all these fun angles to shoot scenes, so you can only focus on the characters in the frame, while you're forgetting about all the killers just outside the frame. His beautiful shots make every encounter, dialogue scene, or chase as frightening as possible because anyone can die. Composer Howard Shore creates very tense scenes with his striking music. I liked Scorsese's very up front soundtrack that bursts into the scenes like a police raid. Sandy Powell's costumes look like real detective and cop uniforms, while the crooks all have this realistic casual appearance.\n\nIn all, The Departed remains a fantastic film from the cinema master Martin Scorsese. Scorsese's fearless and perceptive direction lets you pay attention to only what Marty wants you to see and The Departed is a great trick.",

Farmiga's character is one of the stupidest people I have ever encountered, and an awful therapist to boot. Nobody practices this way. Every line of hers makes the viewer dumber. Jack Nicholson delivers one of his worst performances since he chewed all the scenery in The Shining. His inconsistent intelligence is either owing to the awful script, or to Jack's insistence on ad-libbing. The only interesting thing in the film is the idea that maybe he's a really good draftsman, but we don't get a clear view of the obscene drawing he gives to the costumed catholic actors. DiCaprio couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and nobody is there to tell him which end is open. Haven't seen such an unconvincing addict since the theater department at my high school. Nicholson's girlfriend has a different bad accent everytime she comes on screen, like she's trying out to be the lost member of the Kennedy, Bouvier, and Hepburn families. The plot devices are less complex than an episode of The Bloodhound Gang, and none of the scenes of the criming add up. Not to mention the insanity of having a whole film revolve around microprocessors. Opening scenes in the deli were shot in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. President Bartlett was thrown off a rooftop in DUMBO, Brooklyn. Funeral scenes shot at Greenwood, in Brooklyn. Costigan got his period at a bar in Brooklyn. The skin flick is in a theater in Brooklyn. Only convincing performances delivered by locals. A very bad no good performance by Damon puts it over the top. And whenever this comes on the television, I will watch every minute. This movie sucks ass and it's marvelous. Garbage. Three stars.",

The writing, directing, acting and cast are all phenomenal and make every second of this movie enjoyable. This is a gangster-crime drama that's smart, effective and truly a Martin Scorsese movie. From start to finish the film flows incredibly well and is very engaging and entertaining to watch. The story and plot are very interesting and creative and the way that both are executed is also fantastic. The A-list cast of this film feels like it's out of a dream: Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio, Vera Farmiga, and so many others. The movie doesn't squander any of them and Scorsese does a great job of capitalizing on the chemistry these actors have and making great use of them in general. The dialogue is also great; I love that this movie doesn't hold back on the cursing and vulgar language which makes so many scenes incredibly entertaining in a way that isn't over the top. It also adds a lot of humor to the movie which is nice because so much of this movie is serious, which is appropriate of it's genre. The performances from every cast member are superb; they deliver all their lines perfectly and have some cool accents that amplify a lot of scenes, and overall contribute a lot to how good this movie is. What I like the most about The Departed is how it doesn't hold back on any fronts: language, violence, death and other themes that are core to the gangster-crime drama. It goes full force with all these things to make this movie as realistic as possible and deliver in every way that it needs to, and this works very well towards making the movie successful. I'd say this isn't a movie for kids and you need to be mature and prepared for a lot of what you'll see. This is really an adult movie. The end is also great: it makes everything culminate and wrap up perfectly which allows the movie to conclude on a satisfying and appropriate note. The Departed is well-worthy of the Academy award for Best Picture and I'm glad that it won it cause this is a movie that you need to see whether you're into filmmaking or not. I've seen this film twice and I could watch it again and still have a lot of fun with it. The Departed is an outstanding movie and is a must-see for viewers who are into a variety of different genres since The Departed is a mix of genres and incorporates them all beautifully into it's core premise.",

            "content": "Aggressive and entertaining, The Departed is an in your face, fast moving character driven drama that delivers heart in the midst of heat and violence on Boston's gritty streets. Grounded in strong performances by Dicaprio, Damon and Nicholson (as well as the other famous and civilian faces that pop up) it's easy to be carried on the parallel and intersecting journies of Costigan and Sullivan. The script (adapted from Mou gaan dou) is tight in plot and dialogue, and also delivers on the emotional front. In tandem with wildly fast paced editing and an ever moving camera, the story and image move! The action drives forward like a freight train and while there are moments that settle -- Costigan's nearly incessant dark emotional soup, rightly slows the journey -- they are surrounded by explosions of action and chatter. I'd say one of the most impressive parts of the film is how thoroughly laced with comedic dialogue it is -- a throw back to the quick witted films of the 30s and 40s -- Sturgess and Wilder would be honored. Even the theme music has a stylish quick moving Spanish guitar, and while there may be no explicit context for the choice, it fits right in to the boisterous explosive energy of the moving frame. When Scorcese says he wanted to make a great B movie, it's understandable. The roots here are meant to grow a genre film (a near copy cat of a Hong Kong cop film) and \"that film\" would these days go straight to streaming starring only Wahlberg. But what Scorcese (and Schoonmaker) are able to pack in, elevates the story to an electric dance of epic proportions. Is it his greatest and deepest film, maybe not. But it may just be the most entertaining.",

            "content": "The Departed may be one of the best films ever made. I said it at the beginning of this article but amassing a cast this talented was a masterstroke but to bring a story together you can't just have great actors you also have to have someone leading them and Scorsese is the perfect choice. He loves a gangster flick and he brings this story together incredibly well. Having some of the best actors to ever do it helps also. A lot of these guys are at their absolute best in this film!\n\n\nLeo is brilliant as Billy. We constantly relate to him and what he's going through. He's in so deep and only has two people in the world he can trust and one of them doesn't like him a great deal. The stakes for him are so high and what he has to go through is horrendous. He's trying his best to not get too drawn into the world he's pretending to be a part of and he is doing his utmost to not lose himself as a person. Obviously with such a complex character you need someone to portray him as excellently as Leo does. I can't forget Damon though. He's such a great actor and this film really showcases his levels. We all know him as the quiet hero in the Bourne franchise but in this film he's the sneaky and slimy rat. Him and Leo obviously are both rats but Leo is doing it for good and you can see his struggle with his role whereas Damon is the opposite and he gets more underhanded and dirty the more the film goes along. We genuinely dislike his character and want him to get his comeuppance. \n\nDespite both of those excellent performances from our leads the star of the show for me is Nicholson. He's so eccentrically excellent as Costello. He has that perfect combination of wit and lunacy that all great villains need. Whereas Damon is slimy, Nicholson is not he just plays his part to perfection and comes across as an all time great Mob boss leader. It's such a shame he retired from acting but for me this is up there as one of his greatest roles. \n\n\nI'm not usually a massive lover of films that win Oscars but The Departed for me is what all Oscar movie winners should be about. It's a great film and thoroughly enjoyable for everyone whereas I find most films that win best picture are usually incredibly acted but don't have the most exciting of stories. The Departed has both and that's why it won the Oscar for best picture in 2007 and also a host of other awards including best director for Scorsese. Leo also won a Golden Globe for his performance as Billy. Wahlberg and Nicholson were nominated for best supporting as well. \n\nAs I've said before this film is really one of the all time greats. The acting and story is superb but for me the reason it stands out so vividly in my mind is the ending. It's shocking and moments from it will always stick with me. I remember being blown away by the twists at the end and just when we feel like we're not going to get a happy of sorts ending we do get what we want and in the most brilliant of ways. I honestly do not know how anyone could not like this film. It twists, turns and most importantly surprises you throughout. You're constantly gripped to the story as our characters get themselves into some seriously sticky situations in which we as an audience and engrossed in finding how they get out of them.  It's got something for everyone and is a film that everybody really has to see! \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) hires Colin (Matt Damon) to be a mole in the police department while Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned as an undercover cop weaving through Frank's men. Eventually, the two rats collide, discover each other's identities and they find out Frank has ties with the FBI. Another thing I took note of during the Scorcese binge is his frequent use of Catholic symbolism to establish either a sign of spiritual dominance, family tradition, or redemption. In The Departed, set in Boston, the city with the most catholic families and churches in the United States, the Catholic ideology links to the mafioso. This dynamic motif alluded to Scorcese's previous films Goodfellas and Mean Streets. The final trope I discovered in his filmography is his homage and tribute to other films. The foreshadowing of death is symbolized as the letter \u2018X,' which is a direct reference to Howard Hawks's Scarface. Moral of the story, go see The Departed. \n\n(4 \u00bd Mark Wahlberg blows to the head out of 5)",

A film where a rat is in the police but also into a mob. We see both trying to not get caught as they delve deeper into their surrounding. Both Dicaprio and Damon are impressive in their roles. The film does feel very macho, plenty of guns, plenty of swearing and plenty of violence. Mark Wahlberg got an best supporting actor Oscar nomination for basically being foul mouthed, others i felt deserved it more. Martin Scorcese finally won a best director Oscar, but even he would have to admit he has done much better work. But that does not mean the film is bad by any means, with a cast like that and a great director the film will always have qualities. There are moments that are very tense as Dicaprio is close to being caught. The final shootout is well staged with much crashing off cars and gun fire. I like how the film started as Jack Nicholson mop boss wanders the street with power and links up  with a young Matt Damon, its sets the film nicely for what is to follow. For me the many deaths at the end was off putting to story that was going on. Plus some of the characters were doing things out of character. The film strength is in the acting talent and their scenes bouncing off each other.",

It was all that, and more. Was it my favorite Scorsese film? No. Was it one of the best Oscar winning films I've seen? No. Was it a great movie? Hell yes.\n\nIn a nutshell, a member of a local mob goes undercover in the Massachusetts State Police force. Meanwhile a member of the Special Investigations unit of the same Police Force works his way into being accepted by the local mob. Both of these gentlemen act as moles in the interest of their opposing bosses. Without either mole knowing it, their lives are intertwined through a third party who is completely unaware of either character's true goal or nature.\n\nBy far the best performance is that of Jack Nicholson as mob boss Frank Costello. That is not meant to be a slight in any way against the rousing performances of Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio who play the two mole characters. Several supporting cast members including Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga also turn in engaging characterizations. The only actor I felt did not rise to the level of the others was Mark Wahlberg as Staff Sergeant Dignam. I found his acting to be very one-note and affectatious. Oddly, he was the only actor nominated from this film for an Acting Oscar, so my opinion seems to be in the minority!\n\nIn the first few minutes of the film, mob boss Costello meets his eventual mole, Colin, when he's still a boy. Colin is sitting at the lunch counter of a local convenience store and the setting is the 70's. Costello buys some items for the boy and asks him if he likes comic books. Young Colin says yes, so Costello adds a comic book to the boy's bag. Sadly, the comic he hands him is one that wouldn't be published until the late 80's. This anachronism and lack of attention to detail set things off on a bad note with me, but as the story picked up it was eventually dismissed, tough I did find myself constantly on the lookout for other such errors which detracted from my overall experience.\n\nI'm still unsure if I think the ending was satisfying or not. It wasn't, and yet it was. Perhaps the continual self-debate I'm having is merely a reflection on how good the movie really was overall.",

It's been 13 years since I first saw The Departed in theaters, and I think almost 95% of film critics have already decided they won't praise any Scorsese film made after Goodfellas as an \"instant classic\" ever again out of some weird pretension or whatever. That being said, The Departed holds up just as well as Goodfellas does, and in many ways BETTER than Casino. (Yeah I said it, Sharon Stone & James Woods just aren't able to pass as anything but dead weight these days, however The Departed boasts an ensemble cast or such ridiculous talent that there isn't a single talking role in the whole film that was anything less than stellar.)

            "content": "How strange that Martin Scorsese, one of the most respected American directors of all time, has only directed one Best Picture winner but I suppose that's the Academy for you, it's always too little, too late. That is not to say that The Departed isn't fantastic it's easy to forget that the story is so complex and meanders so often that it would have been incredibly difficult to cut this together into a coherent crime/drama film. This is deservedly considered one of Scorsese's best later works and whilst it was not my personal favorite film of 2006, that honor would go to Friends with Money, it is a worthy Best Picture Winner.\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen, each cast in roles that fit them like a glove. DiCaprio plays Billy, a cop who is forced to go undercover in the Irish Mob and his adversary Damon, becomes a mole in the Special Investigations Unit. Both men work under Mob boss Frank Costello, Nicholson being very Nicholson-y, who may not be all he seems and they both enter into a romantic relationship with Farmiga's Dr. Madolyn. Supporting players within the police force, Sheen and Wahlberg, attempt to aid DiCaprio in his mission whilst struggling to find the mole in their unit.\n\nThe film is a remake of Infernal Affairs (2002), which I confess to not having seen, and the twisty plotline seems like something taken straight out of a Hong Kong crime thriller. This influence is clear throughout as the cinematography echoes that of Cheng Siu-keung in Breaking News (2004) and Fight Back To School (1991), the pure black values and scatological shots of the cityscape create an environment of thick tension. The look of the film is gorgeous as you would expect as Scorsese's camera captures the environment of South Boston, not the most traditionally beautiful area in the world, and finds the special nooks and crannies that possess beauty and the gritty toughness necessary to define the area. Michael Ballhaus, who produced his best work in The Age of Innocence (1993), is on fine form here and the extra effort taken to find beauty in unlikely places enhances the film in a way that helps to drag the film out of being a standard film of this genre.\n\nThe William Monahan screenplay is also special in that it adds extra pieces of characterization that allow the audience to emotionally connect to figures who are otherwise carrying out objectionable actions. The date scene between Farmiga and Damon in particular features writing that hints at Damon's sleaziness, \"So now you're gonna fuck with me?\", whilst making it clear what would make him attractive to Farmiga. Similarly to Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007) the rivalry is dramatic without feeling pained and the motivations of each character are similar but crucially different. Another deserving Academy Award win came for this screenplay and it is disappointing that Monahan's future screenplays were mostly duds with Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014) and The Gambler (2014) being particularly awful.\n\nWahlberg gives his greatest performance, yes I think this beats his turn as a murderous porn star in Boogie Nights (1997), as a cop with a giant chip on his shoulder who ultimately gets the job done. No, Wahlberg is not a great actor but he can be well-used when playing someone striving to be the best who does not have the skills required. Damon is equally brilliant as a scarily manipulative charmer, similarly to The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), and he injects his character with a \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2~creep factor' that plays on his reputation as a \u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2~nice guy' movie star. Despite essentially playing himself Nicholson is darn effective as a two-faced Mob boss and Sheen is dependable as a man with a strong moral center pushed to his limits in dire circumstances. DiCaprio, the star of the film, is largely overshadowed by Damon and Wahlberg, but we still root for him as he chases Farmiga and attempts to maintain his dignity whilst losing so much of himself to his mission.\n\nThis is one of his most popular films, it made $291.5 million, at the box office and is sure to be a film that will be passed down from one generation to the next therefore I don't need to say that it has mass appeal. The film does not reach the heights of Scorsese's greatest films but it is still his eighth best and better than most modern crime thrillers and certainly an enjoyable watch that produced a deserving Best Director win for Scorsese and was the right choice for Best Picture especially when considering it's weak fellow nominees.",

But with overloading the cast with Hollywood megastars just makes it worse. 1 dimensional characters, over the top acting and a plot full of holes. Sure Nicholson and decaprio do a good job and it's entertaining in parts and funny at times, but oscar-worthy? It might be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen.

It is actually a remake to the film, Infernal Affairs from Hong Kong which is something I did not know. Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg have acted and played really good characters in this along with the other cast. Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan who wants to be a cop but is recruited by the captain and the staff sergeant to go undercover because he's no cop just like what he said \"You're no f**king cop!\" Matt Damon as Colin Sullivan who becomes a mole inside the Massachusetts State Police as he is still working for Costello. I've already told you Jack Nicholson as the mobster so I'll move on. Mark Wahlberg as Sgt. Sean Dignam who is willing to take down Costello with his fellow officers and he and Queenan help Costigan give them information about what Costello's doing. The film is really well done. I love it with it's great writing, acting especially with Jack Nicholson who I think steals the show and directing from my favourite director Martin Scorsese. Now there are a few other films with Leonardo DiCaprio collaborating with Martin Scorsese I still need to see, like Gangs of New York, The Aviator and Shutter Island. I've already seen The Wolf of Wall Street. The Departed is a great fantastic crime gangster film and a great remake to the Hong Kong film. He has done it again. He's the best director there is to be thinking about whenever you think of gangster flicks. He does an incredible job directing all of his films especially collaborating with the editor Thelma Schoonmaker who I assume she is known for frequently working with Martin Scorsese and I just watched the BAFTA Awards show the other day. The speech she said is so beautiful I couldn't believe what I've just witnessed. So as it is, this movie is a masterpiece. Give it a watch and see if it interests you enough.",

Jack Nicholson is a maniac. Matt Damon is nervous and anxious. Leonardo DiCaprio is anxious and tough. Mark Wahlberg swears a lot.\n\nUnfortunately, I found the plot to be fairly empty. The characters, despite being wonderfully portrayed, are one-dimensional. There's really no reason to care for any of the characters at all. Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio) just wants to stop being undercover. Colin (Matt Damon) just wants to please Frank (Jack Nicholson). Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) swears a lot.\n\nIt was frustrating that Madolyn (Vera Farmiga) is absolutely useless. She's introduced and we see characters spending time with her, but she holds no influence over the story. She cheats with Billy but doesn't leave Colin. She learns Colin is the rat, but she doesn't tell the police. She literally serves no purpose.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I'm not sure why Frank ended up getting trapped by the police at the end. It didn't really make sense, given the information we'd been shown the entire movie. I'm not sure how Colin didn't think Frank would sell him out if he was arrested.\n\nThe whole thing, while entertaining to watch, was kind of a mess of plot holes and eye rolls.\n\nEveryone raves about the \"twists\" at the end of the film, but I honestly expected everyone to die. It was actually somewhat disappointing to see that, indeed, everyone just dies.",

Not to mention the cinematography was done very well and the only setting that did not look very realistic and easy to tell it was green screened was when (no spoilers) Leonardo DiCaprio's character and Martin Sheen's met on the top of a building, but it looked real enough to gloss over. There were many parts of this film I glossed over which came back at the end to surprise me.

The script was an explosion of entertainment that had me laughing, although sometimes tacky but I'm watched this 12 years after its release. I'm a fan of Death Note since 2006 and seen infernal affairs, yet it didn't dampen my love for this movie. \n\nScorsese once again showed why he is well-respected. There is a substance to his craft that critics will never grasp. He's able to brings out the best in the actors. \n\nLeonardo deserved an Oscar for this performance, heck he deserved one for Gilbert Grape, heck even Shutter Island, people must have something against him. Art-wise this was phenomenal!! Matt Damon showed so much Versatility in this, he embodied RAT in every way and that was challenging. Mark Wahlberg is my favorite actor since I was 12 back in 2000! Seeing him with Matt Damon, finally, and in a movie that's perfect through and through was just a GIFT. AMAZING.",

A masterfully crafted movie with pacing that's not often seen on screen -- it expands the story and the tension between characters for every minute that passes and it is a powerful, relatable and humane movie. We follow characters and their struggles in life regarding decisions they have to face along the way, and they are all visualized by a stunning cast with at least five big Hollywood stars! Some lacking character depth is a truth to some, but it's overall a very deep movie into who we are deep down. The story takes unexpected turns over and over and goes deeper into the mess that we already are in. Add surreal action-sequences and a terrifying antagonist -- 'The Departed' is something extra among other thrillers! \n\nPersonal rating: 85/100\nCritical rating: 95/100",

Well in order for one to find a film extremely engaging and enjoyable there has to be a reason, and where one of my all-time favourites is concerned - 'The Departed' - those successes shine very strongly indeed. Yes this film is one that truly hooks you and wraps you up in the world of these characters and their stories to the extent that you can't take your eyes of the screen, and that's down to a whole host of great things.\nNow mainly of course the credit here lies in the hands of Scorsese himself, as he directs this with all the grit, heart and tension you'd expect to entirely absorb you into every single frame. Also though, it would be positively criminal to not mention the cast who all do absolutely brilliant jobs in their respective roles, or the editing and use of music which gives everything just the right amount of breathing space and energy to keep you in the loop.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Nothing. This is practically a perfect movie.\nVERDICT: 'The Departed' is one of the best, and one of my favourite movies of all time. Scorsese out-does himself again, and he and his team deserve every award that this thing received.",

Jack Nicholson was fantastic as the antagonistic mob boss Frank Costello.\n\nOne thing I didn't like was Martin Sheen and Mark Whalburg as Billy Costigan's superiors.  To me they bordered too much on the good cop/bad cop stereotype and I think that Mark Whalburg was far too over the top in his role as the bad cop.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/zsjgUV",

(Is there a right person to be playing an apparently Irish gangster named \"Frank Costello\"?  Where the hell does that name come from?)  He really seems to be walking around in a different film from the rest of the cast.  His giant presence seems to pull the focus of the film away from where it should be sitting with Damon and DiCaprio.  I have a few other small issues.  Scorsese's usually infallible feel for music seems to have let him down here since he includes both the intolerably awful Dropkick Murphys and a terrible version of \"Confortably Numb\" by Roger Waters with Van Morrison's band (???).  I do like Vera Farmiga quite a lot here, but I'm ultimately unclear why her character is in the film.",

Matt Damon os trying to find out who the rat is for frank, and Leonardo Dicaprio is trying to find the rat for the police. sound brilliant? it is. with an all star supporting cast with Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, and Anthony Anderson, all of the acting is flawless.

            "content": "Any film student or film aficionado can tell you the man behind such iconic movies as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Raging Bull: Martin Scorsese. Scorsese may often work with the same actors and direct stories around criminal life, but there is not a specific distinct style when it comes to his films as you would find with directors such as Tim Burton, John Carpenter, or Christopher Nolan. I mean, how can you compare Hugo to Casino stylistically? What IS behind a lot of Scorsese's films is great storytelling, and The Departed is no different. Though Scorsese deserved an Oscar long before 2007, The Departed lives among some of his greatest work.\n\nWhile it may not be a very diverse ensemble, the cast in this film is simply phenomenal. It consists of iconic white male actors both old and young pulling off their roles as cops and gang members perfectly, and Vera Farmiga doing a \"good enough\" job as a therapist for young cops and undercover workers. While Mark Wahlberg earned himself a deserving nomination for best supporting actor, the actor who steals the show is Leonardo DiCaprio, who probably would have also received a nomination if he had not worked on Blood Diamond the same exact year. We don't know whether to be terrified of Costello (Jack Nicholson) or if we should nervously giggle at his dark sense of humor, Alec Baldwin is at his A-game as an excitable investigator, Matt Damon is Boston personified, and Martin Sheen reminds us why he shouldn't be associated with Charlie Sheen in this day and age.  Phenomenal work all around, and one last note is as odd as this may sound, Mark Wahlberg excels at swearing in this film.  Funny s***.\n\nBased on the foreign script \"Infernal Affairs\" (which this critic is eager to watch) The Departed is unsubtle in its focus on \"rats,\" double agents both in the Irish mafia of Boston as well as the state police force. Matt Damon is a man who was practically raised by Frank Costello to become a rat within the state police while Leonardo DiCaprio plays a young man who grew up in a notorious family who wants to turn his life around by becoming a true cop. Nobody would believe him in a uniform, so Sheen and Wahlberg ask him to gain Costello's trust and he becomes a rat within Costello's gang.\n\nMorality is what is at stake in The Departed. The morality of lying is the most notable since the film is focused on double agents, but even the love triangle developed between Damon, DiCaprio, and Farmiga brings this into question. DiCaprio tries to get under Farmiga's skin at first asking if she lies in general, and as she gets closer to him she confesses that she would lie if her boyfriend (Damon) saw her together with DiCaprio. As we realize that Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio are not the only \"rats\" in the story, it brings not only the morality of lying into question, but also it calls for the audience to ask how we can determine who is on which side of the law. Is there a line? Is the law black and white? Or are there exceptions when it comes to double agents?\n\nWhile the narrative is amazing, it is important to note that this film is littered with swearing and violence, so keep that in mind if you're sensitive to these issues or if you are considering letting a child view this movie. Regarding these same issues, do NOT watch this film on cable TV as it is censored to the point where the dialogue becomes ridiculous and you cannot take the film seriously. Other than that, this film should one day become a required screening in college level film courses; a true masterpiece.\n\n4.0/4.0",

Strip away the glossy exterior of possibly questionable performances by an all-star cast with the direction of a stellar director and you are left with mordantly skewed dialogue from an unoriginal [adapted] script written by the infamous William Monahan who destroyed Ridley Scott's filmography with 'Kingdom of Heaven' (39% RT) and 'Body of Lies' (54% RT) a year or two after some of Scott's greats such as 'Gladiator' (76% RT) and 'Black Hawk Down' (76% RT). Spoiler Alert: His other movies he did the screenplay for: Mojave (2016) got 31% RT (Mark Wahlberg was in this one too). Edge of Darkness got 56% RT. The Gambler (also with Mark Wahlberg) got 46% RT. THESE ARE HIS TOP FILMS. Also I can see Wahlberg trying to get that Best Supporting Actor Oscar with his harlotry by working with Monahan seeing as The Departed got him a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year.\nIf The Departed was written so well why then has Monahan shown that apart from a stolen script he cannot make a proper script? \nIf the Departed was written so well then why has Scorcese refused to make The Departed 2 [Monahan had made a script that would involve bringing back the actors]? \nIf The Departed had such a good script, with so many good actors, with such a large budget for its setting (half of it going to the actors), and Robert DeNiro being in 8 of Scorsese's films with most of them being classics why then did Robert DeNiro decide to decline the offer to star in the film and make another?\nThese aren't conclusively damning questions but watching the movie itself conclusively damns the script...\n\nAlso, read the first paragraph of the reviews from the Top Critics. Most of them praise Scorsese, the actors and how funny the movie is. Only a couple of the Top Critics praise the plot and screenplay. Only one praises Monahan. Also about 8 out of the 44 demonise the film itself.\n\nEveryone was too eager since Casino (1995) to see another true Scorsesian movie and jumped on the bandwagon of this one thinking it was what they needed. In the past 10 years this has been a truer Scorsesian movie just not a great one. Also, swearing and profanity doesn't pass for a good script either. In fact you are more likely to use these tools when you don't have a good script.\n\nP.S. % RT = Rotten Tomatoes critic ratings.",

The problem is I watched Infernal Affairs much too recently and this movie is a direct remake that basically re-uses every single plot-point from that movie, with only a handful of tweaks. This movie is longer and takes more time to establish some of the other characters, but I haven't decided yet if that is a good thing. Part of me appreciates the concise nature of Infernal Affairs, but then I also like how The Departed gives people like Jack Nicholson and Vera Farmiga more room to shine. Speaking of that, one aspect that definitely is in The Departed's favor is the cast. There are so many superb stars in this cast list that it would be silly to even try mentioning them all. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio stood out the most, with Jack Nicholson as a close second. I also felt like more Alec Baldwin would have been amazing, if they had given him a bigger role (or combined his character in with Martin Sheen.) I will say, while I think it is probably accurate to the setting, I didn't need that quantity of language. It's a personal preference, but more than 230 F-words in a 151 minute movie seems a little excessive. The plot would have been fascinating if I hadn't just seen Infernal Affairs, where I absolutely loved the story, but knowing what was coming in The Departed diminished my excitement. I could see, over time and with more views of this movie, my feelings for Infernal Affairs transferring to the English version and The Departed becoming a favorite film. As of right now I need a break from this story, but I'll revisit it somewhere down the line and hopefully post a revised review of The Departed when it is the only movie on my mind.",

In fact, at the time, I felt the HK film was stronger.  But now, at a greater distance, I can see how Scorsese has made this gritty undercover cops-and-robbers drama his own (perhaps it is those Catholic church references).  Although not perfect and sometimes over-indulgent, the film is never less than engaging.  Matt Damon is loathsome as the rat inside the police and Leonardo is suitably wary as the cop inside the gang.  Jack Nicholson plays the crime boss with his usual grand relish.  Marky Mark Wahlberg has a showy bit part as a foul-mouthed staff sergeant and Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are always good value.  Vera Farmiga handles a tricky role as the psychologist girlfriend well.  There are a number of twists and surprises.  I haven't seen all of Scorsese's more recent films but his use of music here is almost clich\u00e9 (for him) - we hear the Rolling Stones prominently.  But I recall that he intended this to be a b-picture (which is what he said about Shutter Island too), so perhaps he is excused.  In fact, the film doesn't have much to say but as an A version of a genre piece, it is pretty fun.",

These young cops' lives intertwine in ways that they never realize and the film twists and turns like a blood soaked ballet, with the Damon and DiCaprio characters both knowing the other exists but not knowing who they actually are.  Does that make sense? \n\nThis is one of Scorsese's best, definitely worthy of his Oscar win and right up there with Goodfella's, Casino and Taxi Driver. His crisp, clip almost staccato style compliments the Oscar winning script (which was adapted from the Hong Kong produced \"Infernal Affairs\"), and screenwriter William Monahan crafts unforgettable characters, especially Nicholson's \"Frank Costello\".  Jack plays the madness of the character to a \"T\", in only the way that Nicholson can, taking the character right to the edge but never taking him over the top.\n\nI also think that this is one of DiCaprio's best ever performances.  He plays \"Billy Costigan\" with just the right edge of constant fear, never really knowing when he's going to be found out.  At times, his own paranoia pushes him to the brink as he immerses himself in the crime world that surrounds him.  He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance here; up against himself for \"Blood Diamond\", and he received an Oscar nom for his performance in \"Blood Diamond\", but not for this first rate performance.  I completely believed him here and I'll have more to say on the comparison of the two performances later.\n\nMatt Damon is good as the crooked cop and I loved his Boston brogue and impish grin, but his boyish good looks make him appear too young to be a hardened cop-on-the-take.  He's too likable to be despicable.\n\nMartin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg are very effective as the team of cops who are \"Billy Costigan's\" only contact inside the police force and have the power to hang him out to dry at any time. Wahlberg was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this turn, but I'm not convinced it was deserved.  I much preferred the performances of Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen or Alec Baldwin, who adds a bit of tongue in cheek humor as an internal affairs cop trying to sniff out the mole. \n\nI don't want to give away much more of the plot, as part of the joy of watching this finely crafted film is the way it takes you off on a violent rollercoaster ride, full of thrilling twist and turns and ups and downs as it roars into it's shocking and blood soaked finale.\n\nWhen I finished watching this film, I said, out loud, to myself, \"That was fun!\" And it truly was, in a fiendish way.",

Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon both give amazing lead performances, but there are also great smaller performances by the likes of Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen.  In my opinion I think this is where Dicaprio got snubbed the hardest by Oscar voters.  I thought at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor was due for his performance in The Departed.  As Billy Costigan he is an absolute disaster because of stress and trying to keep himself together throughout this entire ordeal that he is in the center of.  Dicaprio plays it brilliantly.  There is also an undertone to this movie since it is not the run of the mill old school gangster flick.  This is a very modern movie, there is nothing throwback about The Departed at all.  The use of technology and cell phones is prominent throughout the entire film.  Just showing how lost we would probably be without this technology and how the police and the criminals both use it to their advantage.  The Departed finally got Martin Scorsese his best picture Oscar, and it was well deserved.  I highly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone, you don't have to be a mafia movie fan to enjoy this thriller.",

Perhaps there were a few too many coincidences -- thinking about the sub-plot involving the police psychologist character -- that could have just as easily been excised and the resulting film been just as great?

            "content": "In this review I'm not going to try and show how much better 'Infernal Affairs', the 2002 Honk Kong original of 'The Departed' is than Scorsese's production. Neither am I going to point out how violent this movie is or how many times the characters say 'fuck'. Go read Christopher Orr if you like that stuff. I did not see 'Infernal Affairs' yet. And if you've read any of my other reviews, you know how I think of politically correctness. Yawn.\n\nI have not seen 'Infernal Affairs'. Before watching 'The Departed', I had no clue it was a remake. I will have to check that movie out and I'm interested to see what makes it typically Hong Kong. I know the violence and language are a product of the setting. I am one of those folks who do not believe you can create a believable and genuine atmosphere by removing violence and profanity that may be inherent to the environment. It's like some of these 'critics' love to see a lengthy drama in the setting of South American drug cartels without any swearing or blood. Good luck.\n\nBack to the movie at hand. In short, it's a drama in which two moles are placed in a Boston mobster's unit and the police department respectively. They quickly get wind of each other's existence and a cat-and-mouse game to flush one another out ensues. \n\nThat story is based on the previous movie mentioned before. For the get go, Martin Scorsese sets the Boston tone flawlessly. Eveything from the sets, characters and dialogue fits. With great talent (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Sheen, Wahlberg and more) performing to the best of their abilities, what you end up with is an outstanding production. It's well-paced, well-acted, well-told and, well, just a great movie.\n\nGranted, there are some sudden plot twists that might not be appreciated by everyone, but they do make sense in the world that we're witnessing. All in all, 'Infernal Affairs' might be even better than this. Good for that movie, but I'm reviewing 'The Departed' here. And if you have a chance to see 'The Departed', don't miss it.",

            "content": "In what some would call Scorsese's return to form, the Departed manages to compile a thunderous cast, a break neck pulse and a wonderfully woven tale of deceit and double cross, based on the Asian thriller Infernal Affairs. Set in the wonderful shit hole of Boston, where mobster Frank Costello runs an extremely tried and tested operation, a young up and comer, William Costigan, is forced to go undercover to expose his crimes. However what Costigan soon figures out not only puts himself at risk, it also threatens Costello's informant from the inside, Colin Sullivan, a hot shot New York cop, with an overly compensating nack for offense and defense mechanism that needs some touching up. Its a wonderfully layered tale and although the writer does a decent job of updating the original to an American setting and make it more tongue and cheek, he still cant shake the heavy influence the Asian angle still has on the film. Although brutally hilarious, The Departed at times seems extremely forced and littered with dialogue that it trying its hardest to be approved by Tarintino afficionados. Nicholson and Damon seem to be the only ones who get the joke, leaving delivery of lines by other actors, somewhat a mixed bag, it is without a doubt The Departed's biggest flaw, one that can ask a lot from the audience, however the film more than makes up from its clunky dialogue with wonderful performances, a blistering soundtrack and some brilliant direction. The cast is a Hollywood wet dream, Leonardo DeCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson, Ray Winstone, Vera Fermiga and Alec Baldwin are but a few of the wonderful thespians on offer here and every single one of them knocks it out the park. Leo really shines as under cover agent Costigan, I've never questioned the mans ability, but here all the neysayers have no leg to stand on, he adds a human and desperate angle to the tale, he is our in, our heartbeat and Leo thumps home a wonderfully crafted performance that manages to withstand the talent on offer around him. Damon is equally brilliant, Scorsese should be proud of his choice to cast these two in such a similar, yet contrasting role, both actors have similar backgrounds, yet are wildly different, it adds so much to the film watching two performers use all the tools in their box, to try and uncover one another and even though the couple spend such a sparse amount of time on screen together, both their determination and desperation adds a layer of tension to the piece that no script writer could even dare create. Nicholson is having the time of his life as Frank Costello, its easy at first glance to think \"Old Jack\" is phoning in a performance, until you see him quickly become Frank, this is one of those rare moments where an actor vanishes from before you and your left with a character, it just adds the cherry on top that Nicholson manages to have such a hoot playing him. The supporting cast are all top notch, however it is Wahlberg that steals the show, mostly because his one liners and viperesque presence can be such a wild shift in tone, that it catches you completely off guard, feeling like this loose canon could start a fight during a midnight mass if he needed to. The films other strength is its edit and pacing, luckily we arent bogged down with long drawn out scenes, going over and over the same ground, just to hammer home the point. Scorsese does the opposite in fact, hurtling the audience through his maze, it allows the film to stay fresh and exciting, rather than teeter off into boring cop drama territory. He furthers this by his inclusion of some familiar, yet well chosen toe tappers, from The Rolling Stones to The Dropkick Murphey's both relevant and contrasting bands, who echo the culture of the characters we are asked to invest in. It really adds a lot to the film contextually, without having to stop every 5 minutes and explain the cultural background of what is going on. The film looks decent too and at times, it can look downright hypnotizing, with bold colours, noir-like shadows and 70's psychadelica blaring on the speakers, however the film never really stands out visually for me the entire way through, in fact it doesnt do too much in the way of style, its not a terrible thing, but when Scorsese is trying to input moments here and there, that are clearly so bold and stylistic, only to forget them and their purpose for most of the movie, makes you feel like he is trying to pay too much homage to the original piece rather than flesh out his own vision. It is a minor gripe, but its one that did drag me out the film a little from time to time. The Departed is not perfect, it is visually inconsistent and has some extremely clunky dialogue, but its wonderful character acting, blistering soundtrack and exciting narrative manages to mostly overshadow the low points. It would be a sin not to check it out, but it really is a pale comparison to the likes of Taxi Driver or Wolf Of Wall Street.",

Its got a tight screenplay, brilliant storyline, epic star cast (Nicholson and DiCaprio..two epic performers) and specialist director in the form of Martin Scorsese.

It doesn't matter because they will all be dead before the credits roll. Well, maybe it's gritty with a hard edge? No, the violence is matter-of-fact and in the elevator scene at the end it devolves into three stooges comedy. There's no plot; there's no theme. The story never gets told. Take the pointless characters in \"Carnal Knowledge\" and overlay the senseless death in \"Easy Rider\" times three and you you have something close to this movie. It's a mistake to think that this movie is about either organized crime or the police because has neither the depth nor the common sense of either.  The director seeks to overcome his own clumsy handling of the plot by trying desperately to pump up the drama. However, as he bulldozes over any sense of connection or reality for these characters, the fake drama becomes pointless. Scorsese even resorts to plucking plot points out of thin air to try to save the story but it doesn't work. The ending leaves a number of items left unexplained. More than anything else, this movie was a criminal waste of acting talent.",

And speaking of Jack Nicholson, The Departed gives him an excellent launch pad for delivering his trademark dodgy personality and devil-may-care attitude, which audiences have come to know and love over the decades. Nicholson is indeed a comfort figure for many viewers. Meanwhile, The Departed is not deprived of other acting talent. Leonardo DiCaprio is squarely in the heart of his mentor-mentee relationship with director Martin Scorsese. DiCaprio shows the fearlessness and vulnerability of his character as he loses touch with reality and distrusts all authority figures (except one). Also, Boston-native Matt Damon seems to be having the time of his life. He hams it up as a classic snake-in-the-grass (wouldn't it have been great if Ben Affleck showed up too!). And speaking of Ben Affleck, he is reportedly making a film based on the real-life Whitey Bulger. The supporting characters are all very good as well. Alec Baldwin is a hoot and Mark Wahlberg's acting ability surprised almost everyone with his darkly humorous (yet loyal and arrogant) turn as Dignam. The writing is dyed-in-the-wool Bostonian and top notch coming from screenwriter William Monahan (lace curtain, etc.) It seems to be a rule: if the performers are having a good time than the audience tends to have a good time as well. This is a highly entertaining crime drama written by Boston locals, directed by a legend, and performed at the highest level of acting: enjoyment.",

            "content": "\"I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.\"\n\nThat's the opening monologue from Jack Nicholson who plays the Irish kingpin of South Boston, Frank Costello in Martin Scorsese's \"The Departed.\" The movie is without a doubt one of Scorsese's most entertaining movies since \"Goodfellas,\" and you can definitely tell by watching the movie that the two movies are similar. First off it's a mob movie, just like \"Goodfellas,\" but it's totally different from \"Goodfellas\" and that is what makes it so damn fun to watch. What makes it different is that it's set in South Boston where the Irish rule the town and that there have been a few movies about the Irish mob, but not the way Scorsese delivers the Irish mob in this movie, but it is also not just about the mob, the mob is more in the background as the movie really focuses on the South Boston police department and how they go about trying to catch organized criminals through the use of modern technology such as cell phones. The cell phones play a distinctive role in the movie and should not be underestimated by any means as everyone today has one and that is another thing that is so awesome to watch in this movie is how both the cops and the mafia use cell phones today to get to one another. It definitely goes without saying that Scorsese is the king of mob movies and that nobody can deliver a mob movie the way he does, with the characters, the music he chooses for his movies which I always say he always has the best songs in his movies which is what always makes his movies the best to watch in my opinion. Just listen to \"Goodfellas\" and \"Casino.\" Even \"Mean Streets\" has some awesome songs in that one especially songs by The Rolling Stones which I can Scorsese is a huge fan because he always has at least a few of their songs in his movies, especially the mob movies. But even \"The Aviator\" had some very unique songs from the 1930's to the 1940's and that is where I say Scorsese really is a true artist because nobody makes a movie like him. He really is the best film maker of all time and that is why DeNiro has worked with Scorsese 8 times and Dicaprio has worked with him 5 times already and more to come hopefully. The man has a unique passion for film making and you can definitely see it in his movies and even when you listen to him in interviews you can tell the man constantly has movies on his mind all the time. I can go on and on about Scorsese, but that would take away from my review about the movie even though the review is mostly dedicated to him because I don't think without him I would enjoy movies as much as I do today. \"The Departed\" stars Leonardo DiCaprio who gives one his most amazing and vulnerable performances in this movie as Billy Costigan, the undercover cop who has infiltrated Jack Nicholson's Irish mob and is under constant anxiety fearing his identity might be blown at any second under Nicholson's watch. The second lead in the film is played by Matt Damon who plays Colin Sullivan, who in the beginning of the film is recruited by Nicholson when he is just a kid and seduces him into his Irish mob having him when he is a grown man go undercover in the Special Investigation Unit in the South Boston PD as Nicholson's mole. Both DiCaprio and Damon are constantly playing a cat and mouse game throught the movie as they are both trying to reveal each others identity so it becomes literally a battle of the wits to see who can get to who first before one of their identities are revealed and their lives are screwed for good. Although Matt Damon does impressive work in this movie playing the bad guy, I really felt his performance didn't really come through until the very end of the movie with the rooftop scene with him and DiCaprio where they both literally give it their A game as they literally have a screaming match with each other as DiCaprio tries arresting him once he finds out Damon is the mole for Nicholson. It's a scene for the ages as it really defines the movie for what it is and that is just like Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said \"4 STARS. A NEW AMERICAN CRIME CLASSIC FROM THE LEGENDARY MARTIN SCORSESE.\" And I couldn't agree more, as it truly is a movie for the new generation of movie buffs. Like how I grew up watching \"Goodfellas,\" kids today will grow up watching \"The Departed\" and that's awesome as only Scorsese has such an impact on movie goers that people literally leave the theater quoting the movie like they have seen it a hundred times already. Jack Nicholson as always does awesome work as he is without a doubt one of the best entertainers of all time and one of the best actors that has ever lived. There will never be another Nicholson, just like there will never be another Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro or Gene Hackman for that matter, but what seperates Nicholson from all those other guys is the fact that he can do both comedy and drama. DeNiro has been pretty successful with comedy too with such movies as \"Meet the Parents\" and \"Analyze That,\" but with Nicholson his comedy seems more natural, he doesn't have to prove to be funny, he can do it naturally without even trying. Nicholson you can tell had a blast with this character as he is both fun and crazy to watch at the same time, what else would expect from Nicholson? Remember him in \"As Good As It Gets\" where he played the mean nasty New York City neighbor his OCD that throws Greg Kinnear's dog down the laundry shoot, but has a thing for his waitress played by Helen Hunt? He was terrific in that movie. It definitely belongs in the category of one of the best characters ever in movie history. It belongs right up their with Nicholson's other best performances such as R.P. McMurphy in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" or his early performance in as drunk Georgia lawyer in \"Easy Rider,\" which made him a star over night. But we can't forget too \"The Shining\" and his performance as The Joker in Tim Burton's \"Batman.\" The man has 3 Oscars for a reason. But getting back to the movie which also stars an explosive Mark Wahlberg who tears up the screen in a supporting performance as Sgt. Dignam, who works with Martin Sheen who plays Capt. Queenan (A sort of father figure to DiCaprio in this movie) who both work in the undercover section of the Boston PD, who DiCaprio reports to in the movie. It was really awesome to see DiCaprio and Wahlberg reunite for this movie as they haven't been in a movie together since \"The Basketball Diaries,\" and that was at the time when they were both just kids and on the verge as rising stars in Hollywood. Wahlberg tears into DiCaprio like there is no tomorrow telling him that he knows what he is and he knows what he's not and that is that he's NO. FUCKING. COP! Because he scored a 1400 on his SAT's Wahlberg tells him he's an astronaut not a statie(Boston cop) so they almost beg him to go undercover since he really has no family or friends for that matter and the fact he knows the South Boston under world even though he is really from the North side of Boston in the movie, and the fact that there is a bonus involved, tax free as Martin Sheen puts it. Once both Wahlberg and Sheen tell DiCaprio what is involved with his undercover job, DiCaprio accepts and begins his operation going deep undercover in the south Boston world by doing enough jail time and seeing a court order shrink who is played by the lovely Vera Farmiga, in order to infiltrate Jack Nicholson's Irish mob, but in order to do that DiCaprio gets his cousin who is a drug dealer to let him help him deal drugs in the south Boston neighborhood and that is where he gets the attention of Nicholson and his Irish gang as Ray Winston who is fantastic as Nicholson's right hand man Mr. French, who warns DiCaprio that he knows him and knows his family and that if he ever does another drug deal with his idiot cop magnet of a cousin of his, that he'll forgte that his grandmother was so nice to him and that he'll cut his fuckin' nuts off and tells him \"You understand that!\" DiCaprio of course says absolutely, no problem as Winstone then asks him what he's drinking which is what got DiCaprio into the scuffle with Winstone's character in the first place as before he order a cranberry huice at the bar and one of the bar regulars makes fun of DiCaprio by asking him \"What is is your period?\" and of course DiCaprio retaliates by cracking the guy over the head with a glass cup which is when Winstone interferes to stop DiCaprio from doing more damage. But when Winstone asks him what he's drinking it's priceless because you see it in DiCaprio's face as he hesitates to tell Winstone at first, but eventually comes out with it and Winstone replies back \"What is it your period?\" It's classic Scorsese, but the real credit goes to William Monohan who wrote an extremely and incredible screenplay that won him an Oscar that year the movie was released. But the real comic relief in this movie is Alec Baldwin who is incredibly great and funny as Capt. Ellerby, Damon's boss in the Special Investigation Unit. Baldwin like Nicholson has a timeless gift for being both dramatic and funny at the same time which is what always makes me think that Baldwin is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Wahlberg and Baldwin both have great chemistry in one particular scene when Baldwin allows Wahlberg to brief the Special Investigation Unit about his uncover unit, but Wahlberg doesn't tell them shit as he says it's because Baldwin's character has leaks than the Iraqi navy, and Baldwin retaliates by saysing \"Fuck yourself,\" and Walberg says back \"Well I'm tired from fucking your wife\" \"How's your mother?\" \"Good she's tired from fucking my father.\" It's a great scene between the two of them as you can't help, but wonder that they must have had an awesome time doing that scene together. But Wahlberg who definitely deserved the best supporting Oscar nomination that year for the movie tells the special investigation unit which Damon is attending also that no one will ever know the identity of his and Martin Sheen's undercovers, but only them and them alone. There is one specific part where he tells the F.B.I agent who is working with them when he asks Wahlberg if he has anybody presently undercover in Nicholson's Irish mob and Wahlberg tells him \"Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on feds is that there like mushrooms, feed them shit and keep them in the dark, you ladies have a nice day.\" But what makes it better is when after Wahlberg leaves the room Baldwin tells everyone \"Normally he's a very nice guy,\" which makes the whole room start laughing and then Baldwin says \"Don't judge him from this meeting alone.\" This movie is the best example of great acting as everyone literally brings their A game for Scorsese, who finally won his long overdue Oscar for directing in this movie and you know what, it's about time. Scorsese has been denied the Oscar ever since he first got nominated for best director for \"Raging Bull\" in 1980. Even Clint Eastwood said himself that everyone thought Scorsese was gonna go home that year with the golden statue, but it ended up going to Robert Redford for \"Ordinary People,\" which I'm not saying it didn't deserve it as it is a very good movie, but in all honest how many people talk about \"Ordinary People\" the way they talk about \"Raging Bull\" or \"Goodfellas\" for that matter. Which Scorsese should have definitely taken home the Oscar for that year over Kevin Costner for \"Dances with Wolves.\" Even though Costner's movie is a magnificent movie, Costner has never really followed that up with anything besides \"Open Range,\" which I might have to see again as I remember it being okay. But what makes \"The Departed\" so much fun to watch in the language in the movie. Yea Scorsese uses the F word in the movie but that's what he does. Just like Tarantino uses the N word for his movies. I know the N word is more offensive obviously, but the F word can be just as bad, but that's Scorsese, what else would you want from him. He tells it how it is in his movies, never taking any cheap shots in his films. But it's not even about the F word or the other curse words in the film, it's about the Boston accent that is captured so good in this movie. Like the New York accent was captured perfectly in \"Goodfellas\" the Boston accent will go down as one of the other best accents in movie history. Scorsese has natural talent for getting the accent down in his movies and for storytelling as that is what he is, a master storyteller. Scorsese is and will always be the king of directors in my opinion and even he came about with the rest of the greats such as Spielberg, Lucas, and Coppola, for me Scorsese stands alone in that group as he is truly in my eyes an artist. I would say film maker which is what he is obviously, but Scorsese has a sort of style to him that you can easily point out when you watch his movies and that is what makes him unique.",

This is up there as one of Scorsese's best and I loved it. This film has quite possibly Scorsese's best ensemble of any of his films. Here you have Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Vera Farmiga, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone. Everybody here is amazing especially Jack Nicholson who gives on of his best performances as he perfectly walks that line of unlikeable and likeable. Mark Wahlberg is also amazing and was Oscar nominated for this role which is very deserved as this might be his best performance. While those two do stand out everyone else is just so brilliant and there isn't a bad performance. This film is also fantastically directed by Scorsese who brilliantly captures the grit and atmosphere of South Boston. He just directed this film so well. This movie is also very well written, there's lots of twists and turns that you don't see coming but also the banter between the cops, especially with Mark Wahlberg is very well written. The cinematography by Mark Ballhuas is brilliant here, especially when the camera moves from person to person and we get zooms on people that doesn't feel annoying. This movie is also amazingly edited and I'm so happy they won the Oscar for editing. This film has lots of Scorsese trademarks like tracking shots, voice over and very graphic violence and that just makes this film even better. The ending of this film is absolutely brilliant, all the loose ends are wrapped up and it also contains one of the most violent and suprising deaths ever that just comes out of nowhere. Overall The Departed is a masterpiece and one of Scorsese's best. I absolutely love it and it's probably Scorsese's best modern movie and one of my all time favourite movies. A+",

This crime drama tells the story of two unrelated Boston cops whose connections to the criminal underworld bring their lives colliding together.  As such, this is a very character-driven film.\n\nThe best part of \"The Departed\" is its characters and the incredible actors who bring them to life.  Leonardo DiCaprio gives an excellent, sincere performance as Billy Costigan, a cop from a family of criminals determined to redeem himself.  Matt Damon gives an equally excellent performance as Colin Sullivan, a criminal mole in the police force.  I really like the way Scorsese developed DiCaprio's and Damon's characters as great foils for each other.  Jack Nicholson, as mob boss Frank Costello, just does his thing, with his usual charisma.  And Mark Wahlberg is entertaining in his supporting role.\n\n\"The Departed\" is definitely another Scorsese triumph.  I really enjoyed the performances of DiCaprio, Damon, and Nicholson, and it's only because I was enjoying these performances that I went along with the drawn-out plot.  \"The Departed\" is a well-acted, well-written, and well-directed film.

Now yes, I know this is a remake of the Hong Kong movie Internal Affairs, but why should that take away from the movie? Martin Scorsese really grabs you with his amazing direction. Plain and simple, nobody makes a gangster flick like Scorsese. Plus I can't forget to mention Mark Wahlberg playing the biggest dick bag I've seen in a movie. He's amazing at playing an asshole and I really wish he'd play assholes more often, I mean, after all, he uttered one of the film's most famous lines: \"You're no fuckin' cop!\" Masterly crafted on every level, and with a climax that is so exhilarating I felt like I would explode, The Departed is a film that should be seen by anyone, where gangsters are your thing or not.",

They all preform great, the script is good, and doesn't lay low off the profanity, which I also enjoy, which makes for some odd laughs.  The action is good, and extremely violent, which although is maybe above and beyond that of real life, it's entertaining and makes the action better in my opinion. At first the story is kinda confusing, who is doing what and where, but after a bit it all makes sense, but still is a complex film that required attention. The love story works and doesn't get in the way, and for a movie so violent and full of swearing I was surprised at the relative lack of sexuality. The ending is what I've heard as typical  Martin Scorsese fashion, everyone getting killed, at first I didn't really like that Matt Damon was the survivor of the famous elevator executions, in which no fewer than three main characters ended up on the ground after a bullet to the head from one of their friends. But then Mark Walberg made a surprise appearance in Matt Damond apartment and put him down too.  I thought it was a good way to end a good movie, different that that we are used too.  Overall a very good movie, not a true gangster movie or cop movie but in between, that achieved good results.",

The film submerges the viewer into the life of the Massachusetts State police and the Irish organized crime in Boston. The key roles in this movie include gang members, police officers, undercover officers, mob boss, and a therapist. The films genre falls into the drama category and meets the requirements for the drama genre. A typical genre film involves an emotional buildup of characters and the characters approach to dealing with problems in the film. IN this film the audience is connected to Leonardo Dicaprio (Billy) and follows the conflict of him being on \"off the books\" undercover officer. \nThe sound use in this movie is outstanding. The music is the primary atmosphere setter and uses the music to set the emotion for key plot points. For example the band Dropkick Murphy's plays Shipping up to Boston. This song is played while showing the main group of gang members and helps signify the gangs success and \"don't care\" attitude. \nCinematography of the film is interesting because it gives a dark gloomy look to Boston. This appearance made me want to eat a bowl of England Clam Chowder while watching this great action packed drama. \nEditing provided and overall setting during the action scenes and assisted to contributing to twists. Without giving away any part of the movie the editing is used to give a twist in last parts of the movie. For example there is an elevator scene that turns deadly and the editing assists on changing who the shooter is. \nAs a rating this film receives a high rating and is suggested for any drama go getter.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThe Departed's plot is about two individuals, one a mole for the Boston Irish gang and the other an informant stationed in the Boston police department.\n\nI have seen this film when I was much younger and it didn't impact me that much, though quite a few of its scenes did leave an imprint on my brain. I recently watched the film that inspired this, \"Infernal Affairs\", and going through this again I was recalling memories of the original Hong Kong film and the memories of my past experience with this film. Though they were running through my mind, none of it actually affected my perspective of the film negatively.\n\nThe film is essentially a replica of Infernal Affairs, aside from a few changes, and I was happy to go through the story one more time. In rewatching this, I wasn't searching for thrills or surprises to engage me; instead I was investing my focus on the characters, which was certainly one of the film's biggest changes from the original film. First off, the film's antagonist gains much more exposure as compared to the original film and taking some of the focus away from the two other leads. I was happy with what Scorsese and the writers have done as it does gain us a sense of idea on why this figure is so important, which was lacking a bit on the original film. Another aspect that was different from Infernal Affairs was the lack of focus on the original's core themes, Identity and Morality. This is not to say that they don't appear at all as they are certainly present during the third act of the film, but it only makes an appearance during this area of the film, with no focus on it whatsoever during the 2 hours. This left me a tad disappointed as those were elements that made the first film feel so effective. The third and most obvious is the character Dignam. All of the frustrated policemen that were found in Infernal Affairs was squashed together and moulded into this one character here, which I thought, was a bit of an odd choice, and turns out by the end of the film his role is only present to provide a twist into the story, which I actually didn't mind.\n\nThe Departed core strength is found in its characters, they were written in such an interesting way that I can't keep my eyes off them. The film lets us in deep with the lives of these characters, allowing us to gain a sense of connection in order for the final act to truly pay off. The film lets us in our characters in a psychological level, allowing us to see how their profession and current position affects their personal lives and state of mind.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThe Departed's plot is about two individuals, one a mole for the Boston Irish gang and the other an informant stationed in the Boston police department.\n\nI have seen this film when I was much younger and it didn't impact me that much, though quite a few of its scenes did leave an imprint on my brain. I recently watched the film that inspired this, \"Infernal Affairs\", and going through this again I was recalling memories of the original Hong Kong film and the memories of my past experience with this film. Though they were running through my mind, none of it actually affected my perspective of the film negatively.\n\nThe film is essentially a replica of Infernal Affairs, aside from a few changes, and I was happy to go through the story one more time. In rewatching this, I wasn't searching for thrills or surprises to engage me; instead I was investing my focus on the characters, which was certainly one of the film's biggest changes from the original film. First off, the film's antagonist gains much more exposure as compared to the original film and taking some of the focus away from the two other leads. I was happy with what Scorsese and the writers have done as it does gain us a sense of idea on why this figure is so important, which was lacking a bit on the original film. Another aspect that was different from Infernal Affairs was the lack of focus on the original's core themes, Identity and Morality. This is not to say that they don't appear at all as they are certainly present during the third act of the film, but it only makes an appearance during this area of the film, with no focus on it whatsoever during the 2 hours. This left me a tad disappointed as those were elements that made the first film feel so effective. The third and most obvious is the character Dignam. All of the frustrated policemen that were found in Infernal Affairs was squashed together and moulded into this one character here, which I thought, was a bit of an odd choice, and turns out by the end of the film his role is only present to provide a twist into the story, which I actually didn't mind.\n\nThe Departed core strength is found in its characters, they were written in such an interesting way that I can't keep my eyes off them. The film lets us in deep with the lives of these characters, allowing us to gain a sense of connection in order for the final act to truly pay off. The film lets us in our characters in a psychological level, allowing us to see how their profession and current position affects their personal lives and state of mind. Though I felt it was a bit unnecessary for the character Billy to develop a relationship with his psychiatrist as it felt forced and didn't really do much in changing my perspective or making his story more impacting.\n\nThe film does contain its thrills and for the most part, they still similarly produce the same impact they had on me when I watched it years ago. As this is a Scorsese film, there would be violence, and when they do appear, boy are they bloody.

            "content": "It's really hard to call this a crime drama due to the hilarious insults and creative cursing that is abound throughout.  Leonardo DiCaprio goes DEEP undercover to take down Jack Nicholson's Irish mob boss and is terrified to learn there is a cop in the know informing Frank about everything the police do.  Matt Damon plays the informant on the other side of the law, letting Frank know when danger is around the corner.  \nThis film features great performances from all involved, even though most of the characters are neurotic and somewhat unlikable.  The exception being Martin Sheen's fatherly Captain Queenan, who oversees Leo's undercover work.  He dies three fourths of the way through in a quite shocking manner.  Mark Wahlberg gives probably his best performance as the profane, hilarious Sergeant Dingham.  He has the most stone cold moment at the end of the movie when he takes out the snitch.  Apparently he's so stone cold he wants to get caught as well because he leaves Damon's apartment door wide open when he walks out with the most conspicuous getup on that screams \"assassin\".  Alec Baldwin is just as good as Captain \"World needs plenty of bartenders!\" Ellerby.\nJack Nicholson looks really old, and at times seems to be channeling Jack Torrance a little bit when his performance threatens to go campy, but he does reel it in at the nick of time.  Expect plenty of surprises in the screenplay, as the twist and turns keep coming entertainingly, if not always believably.  Why would you leave evidence of a betrayal visible on your desk where the one person who would understand the piece of evidence could see it?  Still very entertaining all the same.  Score: 8.5",

Scorsese's direction, William Monahan's (a Commonwealth native himself) terrific script and a stellar all-star cast come together to make one of the best and most thrilling gangster films of the past 25 years.

The first time, I thought the pacing was horrible and that it seemed like something Scorsese was trying to do something with - but made it worse.\n\nThis was also another one of the movies Leonardo CiCaprio's habit of overacting did significant damage to.  It seemed like it encouraged Jack Nicholson to go too far as well, which happens to him much less frequently.  Matt Damon was OK, but something about his character seemed too shallow.\n\nI can't recommend watching this...",

My love for Scorsese films runs so deep, how did this movie pass me by for so many years? Anyways, I thought I knew what I was getting myself into when putting this on. I thought it would be some kind of worthy successor to Mean Streets, GoodFellas and Casino. Another Scorsese mob classic? Well, I wouldn't call it a classic. It's a very good film, i assure you, but it in no way compares to the genius of his very best films. It is hard to compare any mob film to the greatest mob film of all time, but when it's made by the same director and you notice all of these little setbacks, it's hard not to be slightly disappointed.\n\nThe acting is by far the film's greatest strength, DiCaprio and Damon provide great intensity in their scenes, no matter how subtle. Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello definitely delivered the best performance. It's that same brand of craziness, and evil, that Nicholson does so well. As an interpretation of Whitey Bulger, it's pretty creative. This is much more of a grandstanding version of Whitey. Watch Black Mass, however, and you'll see a more entrancingly real portrayal of Whitey by Johnny Depp.\n\nThe movie's mystery aspect had me very interested, and so did it's brilliant direction from Scorsese himself. This is, at the end of the day, an action picture. Reminded me a little of an early Guy Ritchie film. Perhaps that is why I felt so differently about this film than his others. It doesn't have Scorsese's words, or even his ideas. That is kind of what draws me to his movies the most. When Marty has his own idea, and puts it to work, you can really tell the difference. His heart and soul is in the picture. Here, I think he just does an excellent job directing someone else's idea. What's sad is that this is the film that granted him his long-overdue Academy Award for best director. Really? This is the film that deserved it? Where were you all during Raging Bull?\n\nI'm being too harsh on a good film. It is a good film. Just not one that I'll think about when I think about one of my favorite directors.",

The angles and style of filming that Martin Scorcese is famous for emanates here, shining brighter than films of kin.\n\n The acting is just amazing, with a star-studded cast that delivers the goods, and then some. I enjoyed Matt Damon in the title roll, and Leonardo DiCaprio trails right behind him. Jack Nicholson brings charisma to the roll of Frank Costello, and executes with Oscar-worthy style. I especially liked Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin's loose cannon-like characters. They provided a stunning edge to an already sharp blade of a film.\n\n I can go on and on about everything else that is good in this movie, how it all clicks together, but I suggest you watch it for yourself if you haven't already, and find out what all the hype is about!

Is Costello really that trustworthy and critical a thinker to believe correlation doesn't equal causation?  The alliterative names are also confusing.\n\nI'm not a fan of early-aughts Marty or Leo, but Leo isn't bad in this role.  Matt Damon's face and voice are too boring to play a villain, Martin Sheen's character is pretty thankless and dies easily, and Marky Mark's character is just a dick for the sake of being a dick - hardly enough meat to develop an Oscar-worthy performance.

The funny thing about this movie was the fact that the f-bomb was dropped almost literally 100 times! Even more than 100 I imagine!! The elevator scene near the end was my favorite course (my favorite scene of all time), and the ending where Matt Damon gets his delivery is my 2nd favorite part to this movie. It is good to see these 3 phenomenal actors work together to create the greatest movie of all time. Not only does Scorsese here brings true grit of an action-packed thriller, but the actors as well. I can go on like this forever if may be. I want to see Scorsese do what he does best on every movie he does, by making the movie flow with many themes, scenes, and sex.

One is an undercover cop infiltrating a criminal organization, while the other is a gangster informant in good standing with the police force. The movie operates as two related storylines following each of the spies. These two stories develop details in parallel but do weave together; they even unknowingly share cross-relationships. This makes the plot rich and satisfyingly complex. The big names in the cast do not disappoint DiCaprio and Damon are great as the leads, and Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin round out an excellent cast that is full of swagger.

            "content": "Martin Scorsese's name has long been synonymous with great films, but I daresay that this might be his magnum opus. The Departed, a twisty and complex crime thriller with elements of The Coen Brothers and Quentin Tarantino to it, is one of the most slickly intelligent, brutally funny, and all-around entertaining movies I've ever seen. It showcases the immense talents of an all-star cast, delivers with classic and quotable dialogue, and (most importantly) will keep you guessing until the very end about everything, right down to what the title means. SPOILER ALERT! Practically everyone in the movie ends up as the title character: \"The Departed.\"\n\nSuch is the way of life in the city of Boston, where crime lords, drug lords, and corrupt cops thrive. Scorsese expertly translates the distinct feel of the city to the screen, incorporating both parts of it: Its gritty underbelly and the facade of stability that it puts on (not to mention the all-around Irish flavor of the film, which really enhances the storytelling). The Departed stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, a cop who has worked his way in with a crime boss (Jack Nicholson) and Matt Damon as the crime boss's apprentice, who has worked his way in with the Boston police. These two play cat-and-mouse for the greater part of the movie, and it's simply mesmerizing. Lesser directors would have taken a straightforward comedic or dramatic approach to this premise, but Scorsese includes elements of both, with truly gut-busting dark humor as well as intense, nail-biting sequences. Few others could have done this (at least, besides the two I mentioned in my intro paragraph).\n\nMy one and only problem with this movie is, sadly, a very easy fix: Damon and DiCaprio's characters are both pretending to be something they're not. In a way, they're pretending to be each other, as one is a criminal disguised as a cop and the other is a cop disguised as a criminal. But this is established from minute one. Others will not have this problem, but I was incredibly let down by the lack of suspense dealt out by Scorsese on this front. If there had been a massive plot twist halfway through, revealing both of the character's true intentions, it would have completely shaken the audience's perception of the movie on the same level as The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, or The Usual Suspects. But when we've been told from the beginning of the movie that these characters aren't who they say they are, there aren't any more secrets to be discovered, and the audience is just waiting for a plot twist that will never come. \n\nHowever, when the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, and Mark Wahlberg (who I suppose is contractually obligated to appear in every Boston-related movie ever made), you can't really argue too much with the results. Even Damon and Wahlberg, who I always think of as a tad uncharismatic, bring their A-game to the film. And the dialogue gives it a big boost as well. Nearly every line Nicholson says is quotable, and he gives it his trademark smug, self-satisfied delivery. Meanwhile, Baldwin and Wahlberg's little banters will make you want to pause the movie, rewind, and watch the scene again just to try and keep track of how fast their brains (and mouths) are moving. The rapid-fire dialogue will keep you on the edge of your seat no matter what, but really, it's the overall feeling of dread and despair that makes this movie work. Scorsese draws from his Taxi Driver playbook here, updating the powerful feel that made that great movie work, and the modern elements make it even more engrossing.\n\nFinal Score for The Departed: 9/10 stars. This intelligent, action-packed, and character-drive gangster classic will remain relevant for decades, and will probably go down in history as one of the many high points of Scorsese's career (before he fucked it all up with Hugo... \"Machines never come with extra parts\"... kill me). Anyway, believe the hype! The Departed is a spectacular movie, and although it has some exceedingly minor problems, I don't think there are many ways that I could have enjoyed it more. Unlike some of Scorsese's work, which has been called \"pretentious\" by those among us who are not elitist cinema snobs, this movie is extremely accessible to anyone who is willing to sit down and enjoy a well-written gangster drama with an awesome story. It's incredibly entertaining.",

Adapted from the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, the film follows the Massachusetts State Police infiltrating Frank Costello's mob, and trying to find a way to take him down, while looking for connections between both Costello and the police.  The film has a very well crafted storyline that remains constant, consistent, and always making the right transitions, thanks to writer William Monahan.  The film has incredible acting that's also aided by the massive use of language and graphic violence, especially Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg.  While the first three deserved yet never got Oscar nods and/or won, Wahlberg received one, and with good reason.  After Boogie Nights, Mark became a huge star, and taking the role showed that over the course of several years, he has matured as an actor, as well as the other candidates, and his role as Sergeant Dignam proves it.  DiCaprio puts himself in a gritty and tense situation as undercover cop Billy Costigan who's investigating Costello.  Speaking of which, let's move on to another performance that is unsettling yet perfection.  Jack Nicholson portrays Costello with a massive temper to show that he's serious, and comedic actions to show a creepy side that soon reveals itself later on, impressive for a man who has portrayed creepy characters for years (guess that got him the role).  Matt Damon is a proud addition to The Departed as a cop who has a long history and connection to Costello, and shows a unique side of him that makes different from other clich\u00c3\u00a9 cops.  This incredibly complex yet perfectly executed is made all that real by director Martin Scorsese, who captures the scenes perfectly alongside cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, and he has his first Oscar that he won for this film after so many losses, proving he is still a great filmmaker who doesn't disappoint in providing worthwhile contributions to the art of cinema.  Howard Shore does a great score, but the great thing about this is its focus on the theme of identity, leaving us wondering who the main characters truly are, and what their fates are, which are revealed in this film, leaving us surprised.  One of Scorsese's best films, and a must-see crime thriller.",

It's a complicated morality tale built around the ideals of misplaced loyalty and forgetting your true identity, and it's also easy for you to lose yourself in this multi-layered story.\n\nScreenwriter William Monahan builds the story as if building a house of cards, and Scorcese knows how to get the best out of his actors. His working relationship with Leonardo DiCaprio was still in its infancy at this point, but it's one of the young star's best work to date.\n\nThe esteemed filmmaker works with Jack Nicholson for the first time and gives the veteran actor a swan song for the ages, and Matt Damon steals the show playing the most conflicted character in the picture. You never really know how to feel about him, as he's clearly betraying his fellow officers but does so out of sheer loyalty for the only father figure he's ever known. Frankly, Damon gives the best performance of the three.\n\nThere's a terrific, breathtaking sequence when Damon calls DiCaprio, and they each realize they're talking to the informant on opposite sides of the law that is the best example possible of why Scorcese is so good at what he does. The music he chooses is also a big part of his films success, and that is certainly true here as well.\n\nHe's done mob movies and cop movies before, but the tricky skill in which \"The Departed\" is told makes it fresh and remarkable at the same time. In a year full of great movies, this one deserved to take home the Oscar for Best Picture. It's a great director and cast at the top of their game.",

            "content": "Plot twists can be very fun or annoying in movies-it all depends on their execution. However, THE DEPARTED (2006), one of my favorite movies of ALL TIME, is a movie in which \"the big twist\" is revealed to the audience-purposefully-within the first 20 minutes, yet I was intrigued, enthralled, and excited the entire time. Directed by the legend Martin Scorsese, The Departed is a remake of the critically acclaimed Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs (2002). The film takes place in Boston in which rookie cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to work his way into the inner circle of ruthless Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson); however Costello also has his own mole in the police department, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who constantly feeds information to Costello about the cops' plans. What follows is a brilliant and suspenseful game of cat and mouse between each man's attempts to discover the other's identity before his cover is blown. The film also stars Mark Wahlberg (who got a Supporting Actor Oscar nod), Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, and Vera Farmiga.\n\nThe Departed is one of the only two movies in which I'll say the remake was BETTER than the original. And it's the movie for which Scorsese finally won the Best Director Oscar, though I think he should have won it years ago for Goodfellas. The Departed also won Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Editing. I know a lot of people who say that Infernal Affairs was better, and don't get me wrong, I think it's fantastic. But for me The Departed was on a whole other level, large in part to Scorsese's direction and the performances. Surprisingly enough, when Scorsese signed to direct The Departed he did not know it was a remake in the first place. However he never watched the original until he was finished with The Departed first. That only added on to why it is so great: it's a remake, but feels entirely like its own DISTINCT movie in the pantheon of Scorsese films. It sucks you into the story immediately too, it is a very engaging film. You could probably find this on TV somewhere, and you'll go to it thinking \"Eh, I'll watch like 5 minutes.\" And then later you look at your phone and realize it's been 2 hours instead. Then again, this is the situation for a lot of Scorsese movies. The film was also the 3rd Scorsese-DiCaprio collaboration, but The Departed is my favorite of them all (others are Gangs of New York, The Aviator, Shutter Island, and The Wolf of Wall Street).\n\nThe revelation was DiCaprio himself-this was definitely the first adult role that he actually grew into, and he literally stole almost every single scene while acting alongside acting legends like Nicholson and Sheen. In fact, every single performance in this film was PHENOMENAL and I absolutely LOVED all the characters too. The Departed would be useless if it did not have strong, intricate characters. As for DiCaprio specifically, definitely one of the best performances of his career and in my opinion one of the most important ones. I feel the most sorry for Costigan though. No one is more of a tortured soul than him in this film. Without a doubt he is my most favorite character in the movie, but it is a rather brutal performance for sure. I had first seen this movie at fairly young age, and there's one scene in particular in which I honestly was on the verge of tears. I hadn't really been a fan of DiCaprio at the time because all I saw before it was Titanic (which I did like). I became a bigger fan of his after Departed though. DiCaprio would have totally gotten the Best Actor nod for THIS movie if he had not starred in Blood Diamond the same year-I think Costigan was better, but no point in getting nominated twice in the SAME category.\n\nHis counterpart on the other hand, Damon aka Sullivan, was spectacular. It is so fun to hate this character (which you're supposed to do anyway) but the way Damon plays Sullivan is amazing and quite deceiving. This guy is a much more collective criminal than most, and honestly if I met the character in real life and hung out with him for some time, never once would I doubt him. Yet he is a mole for the mob. His chemistry with Vera Farmiga was great and seeing their back-and-forth was awesome, but it is large in part due to the astounding screenplay. Costello was hands down a fantastic villain and one of Jack Nicholson's best performances. Nicholson completely enveloped himself in the cruelty and viciousness of this veteran mob boss, but at the same time allowed some levity for the character. Actually, the character of Frank Costello is loosely based off of Whitey Bulger too. He brilliantly portrayed this character and is one of the funniest but also most terrifying people in this movie. For those who have seen it, the \"I smell a rat\" scene... Top three of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie. And that is just with Costello sitting across from Costigan and talking to him. Then in another scene, he takes a boot and slams down on Costigan's broken hand (for reasons I shall not disclose) showing the immense brutality of the character as well.\n\nThe last of the main cops is Mark Wahlberg, who plays Sergeant Dignam, one of the cops that assign Costigan on the undercover mission-mind-blowingly good. He is so good that he is the only supporting actor to get an Oscar nod, even past Nicholson, Damon, and Sheen. Yeah, Walhberg was that awesome. Quick witted, foul-mouthed, to-the-point, sarcastic-was this not a great role for him? I actually find this to be his second best performance of his career, and it was nice to see him play more than a tough guy and show off some real acting chops. Of course, if you get a job in a Scorsese production, you are obviously obligated to give it your all. But I have really enjoyed Wahlberg's successful transition from music to acting-not a lot of musicians act well and many aren't willing to put in the work. But Wahlberg is an exception and I've really enjoyed his films. Finally I have to talk about Vera Farmiga. This was my first exposure to her and I'm baffled as to why she has not gotten more recognition. She's been in more movies, but I don't hear too much buzz around her-she was even in that Jason Reitman film Up in the Air, but people only talk about George Clooney and Anna Kendrick for that movie. This year she had The Judge........... In The Departed her character could have totally been a discarded role. Yet even there I thought it was a very complex and at times a conflicted character, and Farmiga was magnificent in the role too. As for her Boston accent, well, that comes and goes, but for me it didn't really affect my perception of her performance.\n\nNow the score. Again PHENOMENAL!!! No, no this was... The amazing awesomeness of Howard Shore's score, specifically the main theme (which I believe is called Cops and Criminals) cannot be described so simply. Even as I gush about it now, it will not be enough. The main theme for The Departed added so many more layers for this movie because it made it all feel like... a dance. And with the whole point of the film being this cat and mouse game, the score really contributed to that. On top of that, the score felt like- It didn't feel extremely dark and violent, which I think was necessary because Shore's actual score instantly carries you along on the characters journey and it was actually quite essential for me to connect with both the characters and the story. It made me feel as if I'm watching a movie with real human beings, instead of over the top serious and growling cops/criminals bent on killing on each other. Other technical aspects were perfect as well, especially the incredible script, written by William Monahan, and the editing. Thelma Schoonmaker is an editor who has worked with Scorsese for over FORTY YEARS; she's been working with him ever since his debut feature. In this one... I'm speechless. There is not one shot that is unnecessary, there is not one scene that could have been shortened up a bit-overall an amazing job! The Departed also has some quotable lines, many from Costello, such as \"Cop or criminal. When you're facing a loaded gun, what's the difference?\" or \" I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of me.\"\n\nUltimately, The Departed is absolutely one of the best crime dramas of all time!!! This gritty, intelligent film immediately engrossed me within the violent, yet also intriguing world of mobsters and cops. I cannot find any faults with the film. From the script written in pre-production to the editing done in post, everything was perfect. And the ending.... Why the hell did SPOILERS have to be invented? The ending was jaw dropping. The last twenty minutes of this movie were just astounding, and...Everyone please just experience it for themselves. The Departed easily fits in among the best of the plethora of Scorsese films and is definitely a must see movie, especially if you're a film fan or enjoy experiencing remarkable masterpieces of cinema (and check out Infernal Affairs too) - 100/10",

We're not watching Leo DiCaprio and Matt Damon act on screen. We're being pulled into this story by Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan. The premise is simple and gripping, the characters real and genuine. This would be the perfect movie, if it weren't for the many twists and turns the film boasts at the end.

            "content": "The Departed I find to be a good but somewhat overrated film.  Most people (especially critics) regard it as a masterpiece, but I personally do not think so.  It has a great cast, great acting, and a solid story, but I have some issues with it.  I am also not a fan of Martin Scorsese.  The only film of his that I really like is Shutter Island.  I find most of his films to be not my cup of tea (this one included).\nThe plot of the Departed is fairly simple.  On the one hand you have Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is working as a Boston police officer, but is truly working for this gangster named Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  He is a rat that is infiltrating the police force.  On the other hand you have Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wants to be a good cop.  He gets the job of going undercover as one of Costello's men and infiltrate his operation.  Throughout the movie each side is trying to find the rat infiltrating their systems.  \nAs I said the film has an excellent cast.  There are many big names like DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, etc.  Each of them does a great job acting wise.  I also like the story and how it would play out.\nHowever, I do have a few gripes that unfortunately bring the film down for me.  One of them is the characters.  This movie has a huge cast and there are only two characters I cared about are DiCaprio and Martin Sheen's characters.  I liked Cardigan because it is easy to sympathize with him.  Most of his family is dead and he is basically alone.  On top of that most of his family was crooks or offenders.  He often gets regarded as a bad person because of his family history which he does not deserve.  The only person in the film who really trusted him was Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), which is why I liked him as well.  \nThe other characters I find to be horrible people.  Martin Scorsese has a habit of making his characters unlikeable which is one reason why I do not enjoy most of his movies.  Matt Damon's character, for most of the film, was a rat working for this blood-thirsty gangster, which makes him unsympathetic and unlikable.  Mark Wahlberg's character, Dignam, was basically a useless character.  He was an annoying prick throughout the entire film, and that is all he was.  He was completely useless up until the very last scene of the film, which makes me wonder why he was even in the movie.  The girlfriend of DiCaprio and Matt Damon I did not really care about either.  I thought she was incredible bland. \nAnother thing I did not care for was the excessive amount of cussing in the film.  People are dropping the F-bomb every other word it seemed.  It was not just the gangsters but the cops were doing it as well.  Is this how Boston police truly talk?  This movie and Gone Baby Gone made me never want to visit Boston.  I am not offended by swearing, but there is so much of it here that I found it hard to take the film seriously in places.  Scorsese likes to put a great deal of cussing in his films and I do not know why.  Does he think that doing it will make the film more adult?  If anything it makes the film more childish.\nAlso, the ending I did not care for either.  Scorsese likes to have downer endings in his films.  Usually he does it not because the ending fits the story, but for the sake of having a downer ending.  \nOverall, the Departed is a decent film with a great cast, great acting, and a good story.  If you like cop films then check it out.  I just have my own issues with it.  It is not really my cup of tea.",

            "content": "If there was ever a cast created by the hands of God himself it would have Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Sheen, and Mark Wahlberg. What's that you say, The Departed has a cast like that and to add to it it's directed by Martin Scorsese. Well, this is the definition of perfect. Scorsese tends to stick with mobster movies like Goodfellas but he makes them so well. The writing and acting drive this story and the Boston setting is the icing on the cake. Nicholson plays Frank Costello, a Boston mobster who uses Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon, as a cop on the inside. Billy, played by DiCaprio, is an undercover cop sent by Sheen and Wahlberg to work for Costello and help bring him down. Rats on rats on rats. \n\tFirst off, the story is one of the best I have ever seen. The sneaking around and the lying and the deception on all ways possible in amazing to see on screen. Bill lies to Costello about his life to get on the inside and Sullivan is working to bring Costello down while secretly working for him. It's a little hard to wrap the brain around but that makes me fall in love with the movie more. Word gets around that there is a rat in the police unit and Costello thinks there is a rat in his crew. Bottom line, Sullivan has to find himself and Billy has to be careful. The writing behind this is incredible and a few twists and turns are around every corner. \n\tLiving in Boston I know a few things or two about the language. The Departed may be a bit exaggerated but for the most part people do talk like that. The famous Boston accent can be that extreme but it's really extreme in this movie. Some of the actors are not from the Boston area and it shows as they try to force the accent. The cursing is also very extreme. One time I sat down and counted how many times they fay the F word and it was close to 400. Parents be aware, this is not a movie for the kids. Take notice of the R rating. \n\tDamon, DiCaprio, and Nicholson were the stars of this movie but Mark Wahlberg snuck in the backdoor and was amazing. The first scene with him is my favorite in the entire movie. He and Sheen are offering Billy the job and Wahlberg goes off. You can tell Wahlberg had a lot of fun with this role because he plays a scumbag, but he is great. His lines are clever and snarky and when he acts it is entertaining. He stole the show every time he was on screen. He was a jerk but his intentions were positive. A character like this was needed for this movie and again, perfect casting choice and the character was written beautifully. His one flaw is his lack of screen time. There is a big gap in the movie where he isn't there and not involved and I was left wanting more. \n\tNo movie is flawless and I think the one weakness is Madolyn. She's the shrink for cops and criminals. She gets in a relationship with Damon but it's not really touched upon. They get together in the beginning but it's forgotten and overshadowed by everything else going on. She also works with Billy and they develop a relationship. A love triangle develops but it works for a little while but it becomes very two sided if you know what I mean. I don't really like her character as she is just as much of a snake as everybody else and at the end there is a huge plot hole with her. There is a big question that isn't fully answered and every time I watch the movie it drives me mad. Her character could have been so important but she turns out to be a loose end. I wish she could have been written better and given more screen time with Sullivan to make their relationship more believable.\n\tFrom top to bottom each and every single character worked. Besides the start the supporting cast was amazing. Alec Baldwin and Anthony Anderson are in this movie and they are big name guys taking a smaller role like this. They make the best of their material and they are both fantastic. As for the guys on Costello's crew, they are awesome two. Mr. French is a beast and Fitzy is a riot as well. They are characters you don't necessarily know by name but you know their faces and love what they do in the movie. \n\tThe last thirty minutes or so were awesome. Everything unravels and there is one final twist at the end I didn't see coming. Characters get justice, some get screwed, and some get revenge. There are very few plot holes and the end is satisfying. Some characters have confrontations that are very intense. The ending made the movie and every time the credits role I smile and embrace the brilliance.\n\tOverall, The Departed is an amazing film and Scorsese delivers again. There is a lot of violence, swearing, and the movie is long but it is worth every second. DiCaprio deserved an Oscar for his performance but we all know the academy hates him. It did win Best Picture and Best Director. Wahlberg also got nominated for best actor in a supporting role and he probably deserved it but it's not a shock he didn't win. What was good about this movie? Everything, there is no such thing as a perfect movie but in my opinion, this and Titanic are the two closest movies I can think of. WillyT Seal of Approval? Well, yes, obviously.",

While the movie was good, it wasn't as great as everyone were hyping it up to be over the years as I had a couple of problems with the movie itself which I'll get to at the end of the review. The story is about Billy Costigan played by the always amazing Leonardo DiCaprio who is a young cop looking to make a name for himself in the world of law enforcement. However, Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon who is a street-smart criminal has successfully infiltrated the police department with the sole intention of reporting their every move to ruthless syndicate head Frank Costello played by Jack Nicholson. When Billy is assigned the task of working his way into Frank's tightly guarded inner circle, he goes undercover for the police force. Colin is now faced with the responsibility of rooting out the informer before things get out of hand. With the stakes rising and time running out for Billy, he must work fast before his identity is exposed. With a complex story that every man wished to direct, this movie owns with its ensemble cast. Of course every man wants to be Billy, the lead character/undercover cop who dies a true hero or Colin, the criminal who will do anything to get out of trouble successfully but for me, I wish to be Sergeant Dignam played by Mark Wahlberg, the one who just doesn't give a fuck about anyone and tells them to fuck themselves so that he can get the job done- what a badass! Now my problems- 1. The overuse of foul language in certain scenes especially in the scenes with Billy just to make the movie Over 18 and 2. (Including spoilers) The ending where Dignam shoots Colin; that's not tense as it should be. Digman is standing in his apartment not looking intimidating and Colin does not give a scared reaction. Overall, the movie was a blast and I had more than a great experience with this movie. The Departed (2006) gets a 9.4/10.",

Though it's slightly confusing at the start, it slowly but surely grasps your attention and every scene is one to look forward to. Despite Jack Nicholson being the greatest actor of all time, his efforts were shadowed by the unusually good performances by DiCaprio, Damon and Wahlberg, who has never been better. Without being a horror film, it has more jumps and surprises than films that are. What makes this film so engrossing is the fact that you are afraid of who to root for: DiCaprio in the mafia and Damon in the police, you're afraid to cheer for whatever the police are doing, seeing as it could just be another scheme by Sullivan. We are, in a way, the fools of Scorcese's mind, just how both the mafia and the police were the fools of DiCaprio's and Damon's.",

The entire last hour had me incredibly engaged and had multiple scenes that just shocked me with some wonderful twists.

Whereas Infernal Affairs gives obvious nods to Buddhism, Scorcese seems to be drawing from his Catholic upbringing, incorporating Catholic ideas about community, loyalty, and justice. (So it seems to me, at any rate.) Regarding the plot here, a young man named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) gets sent in to infiltrate the inner workings of Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) Irish crime syndicate, while at the same time a man named Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is both a state police trooper and a rat for this Costello character.

Yet a TV series never could've captured the talent  here. Despite some odd cross-scene editing decisions, Scorsese is in exceptional technical and thematic form, and there is nothing wrong with his outstanding artistic sensibility being focused on possibly the most traditional and least provocative script he's ever worked on. \n\nThe best thing about the script is the salty cock-comparing dialogue, particularly as envisaged by Nicholson (a slightly-less cartoony but no-less entertaining version of the Joker)), Winstone, Baldwin and (I can't believe I'm writing this) Wahlberg. \n\nThe story itself might bring little surprises, but there is ample tension and thrills (and laughs) in many individuals scenes. Overall, nowhere near as kinetic or hypnotic as Goodfellas, but Marty's Oscar for this validates his epic career.",

Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon were incredible in this movie playing these super complex roles. Jack Nicolson is also incredible in this movie as well the rest of the cast ( Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg, Martin Sheen, etc. ). The script is brilliant taking all these characters and throwing all these crazy twists with them and they places they have to go just to keep a secret to where their true loyalties are. Lastly, the directing was remarkable! I loved how well put together the whole movie was and how dark and gritty his mob world was.  I'm now a huge fan of Martin Scorcesse ( truthfully the only other movie I've seen of his is Hugo ). Overall incredible movie!!!\n10/10",

Martin Scorsese's best film in my opinion but would have to be pretty hard to screw up a movie with the cast that was within it. The tracks were done by Howard Shore who also did the tracks for all three Lord Of The Rings films, and is pretty well known within the industry. Howard Shore how ever did not impress me with his work in this film and at times had me wondering why certain tracks were placed where they were.

By far the greatest acting jobs of every big name star in here. The script is excellent if you are able to look past the frequent profanity. It begs the question: Do morals really mean anything if we all end up the same in the end? Whether we fight for good or commit pure evil, nothing is going to save us from the unavoidable end, which is death. Taking all that in mind, perhaps, the best aspect of this movie is how realistic Martin Scorsese makes it feel. The audience is fully engaged the entire time. The greatest film of all time!",

A lot of great dialogue comes from him and you end up liking the bastard even through the horrible stuff he's done. Ray Winstone was great too. He is a cool character who also has a lot of great dialogue.\r\n\r\nLeo DiCaprio and Matt Damon also do good in there roles and bring some good humanity to the gruesome story. But, even better than them is Mark Wahlberg(never thought I would say that). He is a jerk who is obsessed with his job. He is fully realized at the end, just when you forget he's in the movie. He plays up being such a douche so well.\r\n\r\nIt's a complicated tale of a cat-and-mouse game.

I mean what else could one expect with Damon, DiCaprio, Wahlberg, Nicholson, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin all in the movie? Each character was formed flawlessly, whether they were the sympathetic protagonist or the humongous asshole. What I find so amazing about this film is the undeniable realism that is portrayed.

The Departed is a terrific film that has everything you would look for in a great movie. Great writing? Check. Great directing? Check. Great performances? Check. Let me go a little more in depth into each of those categories. First off the screenplay that was written by William Monahan is just absolutely incredible. The story is just brilliant and it's told in a very satisfying way because a story like this could have been told very poorly. Every plot twist in this movie surprised me and had me very satisfied. This film also has one of the craziest endings I've ever seen. Another thing that was great about the film writing was the film's dialogue, the dialogue actually sounded as if it were real life because it's just what you would hear out of people today. Scorsese has always done a magnificent job at telling a story and he helps Monahan's screenplay come to life. One thing Scorsese did a great job at was creating suspense, there were so many scenes in this movie were I was at the edge of my seat. Another thing Scorsese does a good job at is pacing the movie because the film is two and a half hours long but it never feels like the film is dragging or going by slow. As fast as acting goes it's truly stunning. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon both give some of the best performances of their career, they are both incredible actors who have given many great performances but their performances in this movie are just standout. They are joined by a knockout supporting cast which includes Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, and Martin Sheen. Overall The Departed is another Scorsese classic that I highly recommend.",

            "content": "Plot: It could be said to be the Irish version of Goodfellas, but that would really not be doing the movie justice. It's plot is extremely enticing, as it follows a mole in the police department, and a mole in the Irish mafia. Unfortunately, that's all I can really say about the plot without giving anything away. It's intelligent, violent, and very intriguing. However, there were some side stories that never gained much ground.\n\nActing/Script: The Bostonian accents are a bit distracting, but I've never been to Boston... so I can't really say how accurate they are. The main characters are distinct enough to be memorable past credits, and everybody gave solid performances. The only 'over acting' I saw in the movie was from Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin, but I believe it was part of their character to be over-the-top so I can't really criticize for that. \n\nSoundtrack/SFX: Keeps the mood of the movie going, and uses a wide array of songs taken from classic rock to Irish punk. Not as memorable as Casino's soundtrack, but solid. The SFX were a bit lacking in the movie however, every gunshot in the movie sounded muffled, or too quiet. \n\nVisuals: Gritty and realistic like a Scorsese movie tends to be, with blood soaked everything to boot. Every head-shot in this movie (which is a lot) was almost artistic, with a halo of blood forming so perfectly on the wall behind the person (which there always was). \n\nOverall: Very good movie, I highly recommend. Not as good as my favorite Scorsese film, Casino, but not his worst movie. If you watch this movie, you will be invested in the story and characters to the point of not feeling the back of your seat (the mark of a good movie).  4.5/5",

            "content": "This film is classic Scorsese, and it finally got the living legend a well deserved Oscar that he has deserved numerous times; 'The Departed' is an excellently executed thriller with outstanding performances from an unbelievably outstanding cast. But seriously though, wow, this cast is through and through perfect: Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson and it just keeps going. DiCaprio's haircut makes him look really young; Matt Damon does his Matt Damon face at one point, with the raised eyebrow and slanted mouth; Alec Baldwin and Marky Mark have hysterical dialogue that really fit them and an absolutely outrageous Jack Nicholson that really does not care about what he says or does, which we find out within the first minute, even if it was kind of funny to see him in a tracksuit killing someone, near the start. Yep, it looks like it had SAG award for Best Performance by a Cast all over it and Leo was put into Supporting because he was already in the Leading category for something else. The only way to make it any better would be if Robert De Niro was in there somewhere. I did always feel bad for the original filmmakers though, Hollywood takes a smaller film that was released a few years before, remake it and then reap all the awards, would have been nice to have seen Mark Wahlberg win as well.\n\nI remember someone saying that Jack Nicholson won an Oscar for this film and even though he didn't, I could see why they thought that though because it's Oscar worthy and it's just great to see him in a role like this, once again. And I laughed when he said that we shouldn't but seriously, why did that character laugh? They could have been killed right there. They keep him in shadow near the beginning and it makes sense stylistically and of course for the story to portray the progression of time, even if I remember seeing Costello's hair longer in shots before seeing the film, as to portray his craziness, I assume. And Mr. French seemed to remain quite casual when he got shot. We see Sullivan's story begin right from the start and Costigan's gets developed as the film goes on and Leonardo DiCaprio's emotions in the parts where he's really struggling to cope with what he was doing was fantastic; he also really did well at committing to that lifestyle. And honestly, I wanted to see Dignam beat up Sullivan so much and, well, I won't spoil it but the look on Dignam's face near the end was fantastic and so satisfying, you knew he loved that moment. \n\nThe story for this film was intelligent whilst also being highly entertaining. It makes sense why they chose Costigan for the job even if I thought he would have been arrested for pretending to be a cop. It wouldn't have made sense for the story but it wasn't the clich\u00e9 moment that they picked the rat out of the crowd of workers even though it would have been odd to see if they picked Sullivan to be the rat. Even though I always do wonder in films like why the person undercover in the police department would go after their own person; I know it's their job but you'd have thought they would stall as much as they can but the story develops in a great way to a believable end, even finding Costello seemed to happen a little too quickly. It'd appear that the film could have ended at 2 hours and that could have been one way to end things but it keeps going for another 20 minutes and its all great. It's shocking and it looks like one character will get away with it all, but at least Sullivan did one good thing before the film ended by recommending Costigan but his face when he's left alone in the cemetery was sad. And it all leads up to an excellent final shot that really solidifies what an excellent film you just witnessed. I haven't really said that much as not to spoil it but it's also hugely entertaining and I just took it all in.\n\nThe way this film is put together is perfect; it has an excellent soundtrack, amazing editing of everything and an overall Scorsese shine that only he can accomplish. If I wasn't told it was Scorsese who directed this, it wouldn't be that hard to figure it out, all of his films have a different feel and tone but he knows how to do his gangster films. I also picked up on the 'x' imagery throughout the film, I thought it was just a coincidence at first but it continues. I thought that one of the plot points would be that either Costigan or Sullivan was getting too adjusted for the lifestyle they had to adapt to and while, out of the two, it'd be more likely for this to happen to Costigan, it didn't happen. There also some jokes about how corrupt the police are, some of which are even told by the police themselves, which was a nice touch.\n\nThere were only a couple of things I didn't really understand. We see DiCaprio's character wearing a wire at one point and even though it was for a very short time, I find it hard to believe Costello didn't find it. It's hidden like any good wire should be but we see Costigan being searched like anyone would be when they enter a place like that and I just find it hard to believe nobody found it. Also, around the same time when Costello suspects there is a rat in his operation, he doesn't think to suspect Costigan, the newly appointed member of his operation, to be that rat? Costello even knows Costigan's family as well as his own background of being a cop. And it also seemed like a tad of a coincidence that the cameras that were placed in that abandoned building were just out of place to oversee that meeting; I know they said they were rushed when placing the cameras, but still, and nobody can text that good without looking at their phone and not making at least one mistake. It also seemed kind of odd that no-one overheard the talk about the wrong address and Costigan still showing up to the right address anyway, but it's not like Costello employs the smartest of people. The ending seemed to happen a tad quickly as well, not the 20 minutes after 2 hours but the end of Costello's reign. The setup for Queenan's exit was clear but it was still shocking and sad to see as well. \n\nScorsese says this was the first film he ever did with a plot, while he was clearly telling a joke, no... That certainly is not true, however, it is a very complex and interesting plot and it is filled with excellent acting and is hugely entertaining; also, poor Brad Pitt for not being one of the producers up for an Oscar. 'The Departed' is, simply, a fantastic film and I'm so glad I've finally seen it and it's another one off the list.",

            "content": "When compared to Martin Scorsese's earlier crime classics such as Taxi driver, The Departed displays that Martin Scorsese is a man who constantly has the idea in his head of how to structure the dynamics of a film so well that it shocks the audience, no matter what decade. And it's about damn time he earned the Academy Award for Best Director for it. \n\nThe Departed was just great, and the dynamics were so powerful and quick that I could barely figure out who was who, and so the product was mesmerising in a great way.\nAnd the general thrills of the atmosphere was perfect, and invoked a sense of mystery that proved that whatever the viewer thinks is going on is wrong, much like in the 1973 classic The Sting, except in a differently complicated way because in The Departed, the story structure takes place in a way that chronicles the dynamics focusing on the heroes, the villains and the rest, ensuring that the audience gets a full feel for character motives and understanding. The assistance with this is primarily thanks to the great actors that are all so talented that there is not one that stands out, because it features many in some of their greatest performances.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio makes a stunning lead, with character development and line delivery iconic of him when he combines forces with Martin Scorsese. His role in The Departed is one of his most powerful to date, and features a chance for the audience to witness one of his richest characterisations available.\nMatt Damon also equally mirrored the skill in a largely against type role as a villain that embraces an image so alike a combination of Leonardo Dicaprio's and Mark Whalberg's that I more-or-less became unsure of who was who, so it was like a mole was planted in the film and there is no way to figure it out which is all a part of the mesmerising experience of The Departed. Matt Damon emphasises every point of his character in a great manner and stuns the audience with his performance as well as the entire film itself. This is also one of his best performances.\nAnd although I didn't witness enough complicated situations or screen time for Mark Whalberg to deserve an Academy Award nomination, his performance was sufficient and strong and ensures that the audience always knew that there was a determined backup character in case anything happens, and so he ensured that The Departed wasn't entirely a series of negative plot dynamics killing each other. He also made an excellent transition from being an ass-cop to being a real cop.\nAnd Jack Nicholson Meade a great premise and ensured that the audiences consistently viewed him in nothing less than a creepy manner only to mesmerise the audience in many ways. His presence ensured that the audience's beliefs of events was constantly unbalanced.\nAlso, the general presence of Martin Sheen provided the perfect feel of nostalgia for The Departed and he was a strong and solid character in one of his best performances in years. His mere voice was nostalgic for the story to take the audience back to the time of the film, and after that was a chance for him to work with Martin Scorsese and he evoked a great performance.\nLastly, I also enjoyed the brief roles played by Anthony Anderson and Alec Baldwin who portrayed much strength in their brief respective time on screen. \n\nSo The Departed is one of Martin Scorsese's greatest modern works, and is composed of a good soundtrack, an excellent cast and some great cinematography, and the praise can all be directed to the mind of masterful director Martin Scorsese who is long overdue for an Academy Award.",

Getting strength from powerhouse acting from the three leads in addition to a solid supporting cats that includes Mark Wahlberg as the profane, provocative, and outrageous staff sergeant of the police and Alec Baldwin as the equally charged and amusing police captain who heads the group of cops going after Nicholson's character. Music is put to good use as usual in a Scorsese film, including a new rendition of Comfortably Numb, along with the customary Rolling Stones. Yes, it's surprising to see his big win come from a crime story set in Boston rather than his home turf in New York, but this one supplies plenty of thrills, double-crosses, and clever dialogue to make for an excellent edge-of-your seat drama from a master director at work.",

Matt Damon simply becomes a corrupt cop, giving hard looks and intriguing, giving everything he have in the tank for his actions, and anything else for this role; Jack Nicholson creates another classic role to add to his resume FANTASTIC acting, his mob boss nearly steals every scene he was in, if not for all the other actors to be so, as I said before, fantastic! However, the biggest surprise to me personally, came from Leonardo DeCaprio, with a superb performance at the top of the boundary. And of course we have Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen, both exelentes as always, and also Mark Walhberg who gives an fantastic performance in his scenes.\nEach character is perfect pitch, every scene is right on the money. The plot is based on a growing dynamic proportions rarely seen in the film, common cop who works for the Mafia but is not all bad; see a street kid who is working undercover cop and this kingdom mafia led by one of the most dangerous Boston mobsters and intelligent.

Let's say that there's rats that are eating each other life like rats will do when they're hungry. The twist and turns with different aspects that just start to crumble down was fascinating. The acting is best part of these performances though. They're straight forward, convincing, and I got lost in the characters. When there's a lot of great actors, sometimes they step on each others toes. They also seem fake because the chemistry is wrong. This isn't the case. The chemistry is on par and everyone seems like they living in this world. \n**spoiler* \ndon't read any further\nThe deaths in this movie was one of the best parts of the movie. They came sudden, unexpected, and tragic. The way it spiraled down hill was brilliant and shows Martin's talent. Leo's characters death was the most surprising out of them all and I read that he died already. Still shocking. \nOverall this movie is on the top tier of Scorsese's caliber list. 9.6",

            "content": "It's odd to think that after three decades (going on four fairly soon) Martin Scorsese hasn't skipped a beat.  He's mastered every genre he's tried, consumed plenty of nominations, and absorbed spectacular work from the actors in his films.  Of all of his films though, Scorsese has always made crime dramas like no other director, and \"The Departed\" is his masterpiece of the decade, and one of his best films.  His talents form together to make this film, with flawless results.  His unusual artistic style has never worked better.\n\tThe plot revolves around Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), and Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  Costigan and Sullivan are both cops, while Costello is a crime lord that rivals the evilness and power of Marlon Brando in \"The Godfather\".  The twist is, though, is that Sullivan just happens to be Costello's \"son\" (after meeting him as a child, he trained Sullivan to play a policeman his entire life), who's quickly shot to the top of the police world and now serves as an informer.  In the meantime, Costigan is a man with a bad background who becomes a cop, but before long is assigned by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to use his family ties in order to work as an undercover policeman-- this time to join Costello's entourage and work as an insider.  Before long, everything will be at stake.\n\t\"The Departed\" is so perfect it's almost hard to begin.  What appears to be an ingenious story molds into brilliance, climbing to a breaking point of a climax, and ending with tragedy that rivals any play Arthur Miller could write.  While we think we know what will happen when the film begins, every second thereafter is instead heightened by a sense of reality, thereby making it constantly thrilling, and unpredictable.  The dialogue all feels real, making us feel, without a doubt, that this is what real life criminals talk like.  At this point, Scorsese is one of the few to master this difficult task.\n\tThe actors all give one of their best performances.  While Nicholson is clearly the veteran here, his psychopathic and utterly unnerving portrayal of Costello simply brilliant, it's only a side performance compared to both DiCaprio and Damon.  DiCaprio constantly plays his character with regret and anxiety, making Costigan the most compelling character because we can never tell whether his past will catch up with him.  Damon is excellent as well, throwing away his usual charisma, and playing a villain just as morally evil and Costello, while creating a fa\u00e7ade that's both believable and subtle.  Though Wahlberg was the only actor nominated for the film, his performance does not compare with the three leads.\n\t\"The Departed\" is phenomenal.  On one hand, it's a terrific piece of entertainment.  On the other, it's a masterpiece that will surely be up to the ranks of \"Taxi Driver\"-- it may as well already be.  Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Martin Scorsese is certainly a Director whose stamp can be felt anywhere, since he stopped writing his own scripts sometime after Goodfellas its been less pronounced but even as the voice feels less and less like his own he still manages to make his presence as a Director which is pretty special in and of itself. And weirdly enough, nowhere in his surprising amount of work in the past decade for a man who's now 70 years old has his influence over the proceedings felt more present than in 2006's The Departed a film which adapted the Hong Kong crime Thriller Internal Affairs into modern day Boston. The Academy Awards certainly thought so and at long last rewarded Scorsese that year with the coveted Best Director and Best Picture one two punch for the film which makes the movie of a certain significance in the History of Cinema for that fact alone as well as marking a return to Gangster movies and the Directors Third outing with current favorite Actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The movie is seen as a career defining triumph, it certainly bears all the markings of past Scorsese Gangster flicks but one can't help but question how much of that is done through wish fulfillment, circumstance and careful marketing. Even with its overwhelmingly positive reception if the movie hadn't netted Scorsese his Oscar Glory would people still be so quick to heap such high accolades upon it? And a cynical mind can't help but think how a good team of Hollywood Producers could have fooled people into viewing this as more of a pure Scorsese movie than it is, the strategic casting of Jack Nicholson a beloved Actor from Scorsese's heyday who'd yet to work with the Directing Giant was certain to generate buzz by itself as well as some posters which featured a simple design of The title in the shape of a smoking handgun recalling Scorsese's breakthrough picture Mean Streets is poster. But Marty's a legend and so many love this movie it's certainly worth checking out so let's maybe take a look. Or Maybe Not. Or Maybe Fuck Yourself.\n\nOf the myriad ensemble of characters that inhabit this film debatably the central one is Irish Mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson). Costello is the head of the Irish Mob which has run Boston since the 70s keeping other groups in check and in this time has managed to while generating massive Police Attention place a high level mole in the Special Investigation Department of the Boston PD in the form of smooth talking Colin Sullivan. In a web of conspiracy and lies the Undercover unit headed by Captain Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) have managed to create a cover for and plant a plain clothes cop, Billy Costigan (DiCaprio), who grew up in the area in Costello's inner circle and both groups are tightening the noose on one another. As the Boston PD under Captain George Ellerby (Alec Baldwin) closes in on Costello's latest racket of selling microchips to Chinese buyers offshore Costigan and Sullivan struggle to discover each others identities before the other does. And all the while Costigan, who is slowly losing his grip on sanity and control of his situation, carries on an affair unknowingly with Sullivan's lover The Department's Psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). \n\nThe undeniable great strength of The Departed rests in the story it creates, not necessarily how good or relatable its characters are we'll get to that later, but more how its complex set up pays off with insanely compelling and good drama. It ups the cat and mouse, cop and criminal game to a whole new level one that is still fairly simple on the surface but insanely rewarding to watch unfold. All it does is add the element of cop chases criminal a cop who is pretending to be a criminal, and a criminal who is pretending to be a cop but the brilliance in that simplicity really pays off. And the biggest way it pays off is the ingenuous way it melds cell phones and modern technology into the mix the way many other cop and gangster dramas today are scared to which is why so many of them are period or pretend the Internet does not exist. The movie builds an eerie at times almost oppressive sense of tension in the anonymity and hands off nature of the technological world, in multiple scenes Sullivan's character orchestrates counter intelligence moves that suit his ends without ever leaving his office at the Police Station and all the cops rely on technology to aid them bust Costello to a fault. And this make the visceral and stripped down scenes all the more intense one of the most nail biting parts of the whole movie is a foot chase through a crowd between Sullivan and Costigan in the Chinatown District which is pretty low key stuff writing wise. But that's not to say its a movie without its flaws, the characters though technically written well behave like they're in an over wrought morality play even by Scorsese standards. The characters that are bad are raving lunatics and out of control psychopaths or else sniveling impotent weaklings without an ounce of humanity while the good characters who are honest cops can at worst be accused of having some abnormally salty language and being liberal with dispensing beatings when frustrated. It creates a kind of bizarre dichotomy considering how besides that these are really well fleshed out and engrossing characters you kind of wish it weren't so quick to label them good and evil. The incredibly solid script is also aided by universally fantastic performances, particularly Matt Damon who has never lost himself so much in a role before or since nor taken on a role as juicy. Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicholson talk circles around the rest of the admittedly great cast though dispensing memorable and often hilarious witticisms and one liners that I suspect along with the violence are part of the reason for the film's mass appeal.\n\nThe Departed is one of those movies that succeeds and fails mightily and luckily for it though it could have gone either way it succeeds enough those failures are rendered all but moot. It's pacing is at times damn near break neck, I've never seen Infernal Affairs but its a Hong Kong Cop Thriller so I assume part of that is being an adaption of it but honestly along with the technology thing it just serves to make it feel fresh and unique even among Scorsese movies. And Scorsese leaves his imprint their enough while I wouldn't call it career defining the 2 and a half hour near epic could indeed be viewed as a career spanning thesis. We get the sudden burst of violence, mixed in with exposition on the nature of morality, overt Catholic imagery and a dirty but ultimately colorful portrayal of a major city. Hell we even get a significant scene taking place in a porno theater like his classic Taxi Driver which this reminds me of in style more so than any other. All in all luckily this movie is far from all hype, it's at once exhilarating and fucking fantastic a mind bending crime thriller that will be viewed and discussed though maybe mostly in relation to Scorsese's other work for years to come.",

The plot has to do with two young men who were in the Massachusetts Police Academy. One is tailored by the Irish mobster Frank Costello to become a mole within the police. The other is called upon to infiltrate the mob before he graduates. Thus begins their dangerous assignments as each tires to find the rat in the other organization while also working to stay out of reproach. Costigan is able to get close to the vile Costello while Sullivan is part of the Special Investigation Unit and also begins a relationship with a psychologist. They must secretly keep contact with the other side but it becomes increasingly treacherous with one encounter leading to a chase and another in the death of a police captain. The heat is on as both men try and reveal the other mole. During a cocaine pick up Costello is traced to the spot and a chaotic shootout ensues. Everything seems calm again and yet Constello's mole is still around and bent on erasing Costigan from record. They agree to meet on a roof top and from that point on the film moves so rapidly it is almost impossible to take in what happens. Everything seems confused and corrupted but ultimately it does not pay to be a rat. This film has a lot of coarse language and violence but in Scorsese's hands it is still an intriguing film to watch.",

However, when I sat down to watch The Departed, I was skeptical because Martin Scorsese has made such excellent crime dramas in the past that I was almost positive that this could never live up to expectation. Thankfully, it did! I now watch this film every other month along with Goodfellas. \n\nThe film centers on two main characters, each a protagonist, but each an antagonist to the other. These are William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon). Costigan is a cop undercover in the Irish mafia of Boston, while Sullivan is the opposite: an informant for the mob, undercover in the police department. They both race to uncover the other's identity before they are caught themselves. \n\nThe acting in this film is superb on all levels. DiCaprio and Damon are both very good. Jack Nicholson fails to dissapoint (as always) in his role as the mob boss. Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen play excellent foils as crime unit detectives because Wahlberg is a mean douchebag while Sheen is a sympathetic older gentleman. \n\nAlthough there already is a good handfull of household names in the film's cast, Martin Scorsese is the star of the film. He takes the classic mafia story, and twists it to include the police, and the Irish mob instead of Italian. His wonderful directing and camera movements are, once again, perfect. There are too many good camera shots to mention, so I just won't mention any so none will be left out. One of the joys of this film is the spectacular surprise ending! Shocking!\n\nAnybody that has enjoyed the other three masterpieces by Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas) will definitely enjoy this one as well. Put down everything and watch this film now.",

            "content": "The Departed\n\nMartin Scorsese, sure, is an old timer but the kind of movies he delivered in the past has left an indelible impression not only on people but also on the word called \u00e2cinema\u00e2?. We\u00e2(TM)ve seen him deliver some of the best and awesomely gruesome crime epics in his long lineage of legendry. With \u00e2The Departed\u00e2?, the legend is back to his best forte \u00e2\" street crime, espionage, and thuggery bounced back against basic human instincts of survival, fear, courage and treachery.\n\nPlot:\n\nColin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is trained to be injected in to Massachusetts state police by organized crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). On a parallel beam police academy dropout Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is drawn in to the world of spying and debauchery given his ineffable family background. The film kicks pace when both these characters come to know about their existence and line of work ultimately culminating towards the concept of \u00e2root out\u00e2?. \n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe film is loosely based on 2002 Hongkong film \u00e2Infernal Affairs\u00e2? but is totally limited to the padding from it. The free flowing screenplay by William Monahan infuses more vigor and vitality to the movie compared to its original counterpart. The director and writer take a lot of time in setting up the lead characters rendering a draggy feeling to the initial run. But once the lead characters get pitted against each other, the film veers off like a speedy demon. All characters in the movie are given a perfect human aspect carefully treading the path of crime vs. feel.\n\nDiCaprio as Billy Costigan is the best package of the film and truly delivers one of the best performances of his life. The insular moments of marauding between fear, depression, helplessness and gumption are exceptionally well designed and \u00e2Billy\u00e2? aces them like a spade. As a kid, with troubled family background bustling up to the ranks of police academy, who gets thrown in to the world of organized crime laced with blood, guts and glory he\u00e2(TM)s as delicate as a cotton thread.\n\nMatt Damon as Sullivan does justice to the role and brings his usual panache to the character. Jack Nicholson as Costello brings forth a \u00e2touch of the devil\u00e2? feel but inconsistently. He\u00e2(TM)s given a pure devilish fa\u00c3\u00a7ade that fades away as we sail through the gruesome plot. Irrespective of his character he portrays it with his usual ease and expertise. Mark Wahlberg as Sergeant Dignam is ruthless, condescending and funny at the same time.\n\nScorsese as the primary helmsman is downright excellent. He is one of the best directors when it comes to dramatizing street crime for the silver screen. Just like every other movie there are gaping holes in its screenplay and character setup but the movie\u00e2(TM)s picked up pace and adrenaline covers for everything.\n\nTail piece:\nScorsese always teams up with individuals epitomized by uncanny portrayal abilities. We have seen the legend partner with Robert DeNiro, in the past, and deliver some of the best classics of crime/gangster genre. It\u00e2(TM)s pretty nice to see him hit it off with DiCaprio in today\u00e2(TM)s era and the grapevine promises more cinematic outings from the duo.",
