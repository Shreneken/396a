For that matter, all casting and performances were spot on and convincing. I did feel the 117 min runtime was slightly too long for the narrative, and could've of used a little less filler and more substance, although the substance that played out was done very well, especially due to Smith's emotional performance. The pacing could've been a little better, but overall, the realistic feel of the narrative keeps you watching. It's a great inspirational story told very well.",

The film seemed to promote making lots of money as the key to 'happiness', which is an oversimplification. Happiness and pleasure are only temporary feelings, not things that can be maintained long-term. The main character getting a high paying job only means he has less financial restrictions, which could assist in being happier but not necessarily because his marriage was in shambles, there's work stress, and so on. In terms of the plot, it was far fetched, predictable, and made numerous alterations to the true story (e.g. he was paid in the training programme, he was never hit by a car, etc). Furthermore, there was far too much running around after scanners and showing doctors scanners, which hurt the otherwise fine pacing. The characters were believable but many lacked depth. More should have been said about the marriage, and I'm sure most people in the main character's position would just try to find a more consistent job if the finances were that bad. However, the dialogue was generally good, the acting was solid, and the cinematography, visual effects, and sets/props/costumes looked the part. The soundtrack fit what was on screen, but I've forgotten it.",

            "content": "The Pursuit Of Happyness Review\nBy: Will Gardell\n\nThe Pursuit of Happyness is a film released in 2006 directed by Gabriele Muccino. The film follows Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, and his son Christopher, played by Jayden Smith. Due to a bad investment in bone-density scanners Chris is in deep debt, in the film, Chris Gardner must fight against poverty and homelessness while still trying to provide a good childhood to his son. Watch Chris and his son face off against some of the worst odds in this heart wrenching to heart warming film that was based on a true story. \n\nThe Aspect of the movie that stood out to me most was watching Chris Gardner keep his son's sense of wonder and innocence safe, even in the toughest of times. Chris teaches his son to use his imagination to make life more fun and interesting. He teaches Christopher to use his imagination as an escape from the scariness of the real world. This plotline hits close to home for me, when I was a child my dad would have to leave for three weeks at a time, and money was pretty tight, but my parents taught me to make up imaginary worlds. They taught me to use my imagination to have fun, no matter what our situation was. Seeing this articulated so well in a movie brought me a lot of joy. This aspect of the film also conveys to us how good a father Chris is, it shows how much he loves and cares for his son. \n\nPersonally I thought the movie was wonderful! It truly grabs at your heart, it is a rollercoaster of joy, to sadness, to joy again. The movie does a great job of making you feel for the characters, you desperately want them to succeed and feel terrible when they suffer a loss. Cinematically the shots are pristine, my favorites being the tracking shot of Chris trying to memorize a phone number, or the wide shot of Chris and Christopher on the bench in the subway. The fact that it is based on a true story makes the gratification of this film all the better, and was one of the factors that made the script so good. The writing in this movie is raw and impactful, especially in the scenes where Chris and his wife are arguing. If you are thinking about watching this movie, stop thinking about it and do it. I would highly recommend it, 4.5/5 stars.",

            "content": "The Pursuit of Happyness is a drama based on a true story, produced by Gabrielle Muccino that was released in 2006. This film stars Will Smith, Thandwie Newton, and Jaden Smith. It takes place in San Francisco 1981 where a struggling single father and salesman, Chris Gardner, has invested his family savings in a bone-density scanner company. He has a hard time selling the scanners and this eventually leads to problems with his wife and him and his son getting evicted from their small apartment with nowhere to go. Together they endure hardships, and Chris finds the chance to fight for an internship but never gives up on trying to create a better life for him and his son.\n\nIn the film, Rubix cubes have just become the new biggest toy of 1981 and everyone has gotten their hands on one. No one has been able to solve it yet, except for Chris. He solves it in a taxi, while under the pressure of time, in front of the businessman he is hoping to work for and he is immediately impressed. This scene shows how smart Chris really is even though he is not wealthy and how people underestimate Chris and his dedication.\n\nOverall I thought this was an incredible and inspiring film about family, determination and objective in life. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a happy ending, with a few tear jerkers along the way. The relationship Chris has with his son in the film is so strong that they overcome their biggest downfall while remaining together through it all. In the film Chris' son is played by Jaden Smith, who is the son of Will Smith in real life which is how Will was able to connect with the plot more emotionally. You can feel their emotions through the screen. It is truly an uplifting movie that teaches adults and young adults a very valuable lesson of always trying to achieve your goals.",

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, plays the role of Christoper Jr, who is an intellectual and joyful child. The story takes place within the hard life of San Francisco, California, and Chris Gardner tries to utilize his intellect and his hard work ethic to make it in the big city. \n\nThe best aspect that stood out to me within this incredible film was the acting itself. Will Smith played a perfect role as Chris Gardner. He put every scene with emotion and passion, and I appreciate the phenomenal acting on his part. Jaden Smith also played a significant role in this movie with his outstanding performance. I would've liked to see him more in the film to see more of his acting, but I was satisfied when he was on the screen. The plot of the story was also good, in my opinion. The story was very immersive, and there wasn't a moment in the film where I felt bored or started the feel like it was unnecessary filler scenes. In my opinion, every scene had significance in the movie.\n\nMy overall reaction to the movie is positive, not anything. I cannot say anything negative about the film besides Jaden Smith having not enough action. The quality of the movie is excellent; the film crew never sugarcoated the struggle of being homeless in big cities and portrayed the hardships of living in a big city like San Francisco. I recommend this film to anyone regardless of age, sex, race, it is an excellent film, and everyone should see it; it's truly inspirational. I give this movie a five out of five stars.",

Regardless, this movie is much longer than it needs to be. For starters, there are a number of plot points the movie begins but never resolves; Entire scenes and characters could be cut with virtually no consequence to either the plot or the emotional impact of the film, others seem to exist solely to make the protagonist suffer in some annoying yet meaningless way (like the office manager). However, The Pursuit of Happyness still has a mostly solid plot, and it does a lot more things right than it does wrong, all the while providing a thought-provoking look at the modern American Dream.",

The was definitely worth my while, and the overarching theme of dedication, perseverance, and survival really resonated with me. The movie initially started off quite slow, but I felt that the exposition was well-thought out and properly established Chris Gardner's background and his relationship with his son. Although this movie placed such an emphasis on the money's importance in life, the film did a great job at demonstrating the hardships that Chris Gardner endured: a poor investment on bone density scanners; his failed relationship with his wife; and his lack of financial stability, causing him to resort to homeless shelters for he and his son. Ultimately, this movie embodies the sentiments of the American dream, and to top it all off, it's based on a true story.",

            "content": "The Pursuit of Happyness\nSummary:\nThis movie is based on the story of a salesman named Chris Gardner who has strong faith to overcome the challenges in life to achieve his goals and finally, become a successful man. Salesman Chris invests all of his money in portable bone-density scanners. He tries so hard to sell portable bone-density scanners to the hospitals from early mornings to late nights. However, he has difficulty selling scanners because the scanner which he sells is more expensive than others, even though the quality of scanners better than others, but the quality isn't equal to value. That's why he only sold some of them out, this amount of income couldn't afford his family's expenses and the housing rent. The financial crisis erodes his marriage, and his wife was very disappointed at him and left him. \n\nLife is hard, but he never gives up, he is seeking a way to get out of the financial crisis. One day, he meets Jay Twistle, a manager for Dean Witter. He wants to apply for a position as a stockbroker, but Jay doesn't want to meet him. He follows Jay and gets a shared taxi ride with Jay, and impresses Jay by solving a Rubik's Cube which Jay couldn't solve. Jay gave him a chance for an interview. A day before the interview, he was caught by the police while he was painting the apartment, and asking him to pay for the numerous parking tickets he has accumulated. He spent a night in jail until his check clears. That's why he has to rush the time in the morning and run to his interview. Since he doesn't have time to switch the clothes, so he still wears his shabby, paint splashed clothes to interview, this appearance and his performance impressed the interviewers, they gave him a chance for an internship. This was pretty good news. On the other hand,  he and his five-year-old son became homeless since he didn't have money to pay for rent. They lived in many places, like a BART station restroom and a homeless shelter. But he never told anyone about his difficulties, in contrast, he still worked hard to sell the scanners and study whenever he has time, even very late night. His hard work ends up with completes the stockbroker license test faster than any of the other candidates. He finished the internship and earned the job. \nAt the end of the movie, it said Chris forms his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical film directed by Gabriele Muccino. This movie is one of my favorites. When I went through a tough time, I always want to rewatch it again, because it encourages me a lot. From the beginning of the movie, the scene is about Chris catching every opportunity to sell the bone-density scanners, but he ends up with bankruptcy and to be a homeless person who lives in a station and shelter. The middle part is about Chris never give up even he became homeless and many tough situations, but nothing is stopping him to achieve his aims. Finally, his hard work is paid off, he forms his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm. There is a huge contrast from beginning to end. In the beginning, it's a realistic scene of the life of low-class people, who pay more than they earn, work hard but they are still very poor, and they live without hope. However, Chris impressed me with his good example to show me that no matter how bad the situation is, but we are still able to achieve our goals through faith and hard work. \n\nCritique/Recommendation:\n \nI think this movie is very successful at expressing faith and hard work that can change our life. It also gives people hope, especially those who are in a low class, having a hard time in life. It encourages them to never give up, and work hard to achieve their goals. The filmmakers made this film very realistic and inspirational. Especially, there is a contrast between the beginning and the end. The actors express Chris' character well. This movie was very popular and I really recommend everyone to watch it. If I were rating this movie, from one to five stars, I would give it 4.6/5 stars.",

His struggles are tough, and it\u2019s never what I\u2019d describe as a fun film. I appreciate seeing how a man works through the dark times in order to come out in a better situation, because it shows the value of hard work and dedication. The power of all this is magnified, and the stakes are increased, because he is raising a child through it all. I was a little put off by the fact that he probably wasn\u2019t providing a better home for his son, and by all rights should have sent the son to live with his mother if she had a stable living situation. However, I do know it might have killed his determination and by letting the son go, he might have never seen him again. Also, many of the complaints that I would have about the actions taken by characters in the film have to be forgiven simply because this is all grounded in the real history of Chris Gardner. There is an authenticity to the story-telling here that reinforces the fact that it is a true story. While I\u2019m sure they took some artistic license, it still felt grounded. I\u2019m on the fence about the narration in The Pursuit of Happyness. I almost feel like it should have been done by a third-party narrator, rather than Chris Gardner himself. Also, titling different parts of the film as though they were chapters in a book did nothing for me. However, I appreciate the shorthand they were able to achieve using narration. It could be hard to visually show some of the things that set the main character apart from the other interns, so explaining it in a couple of lines helps a lot. I think Will Smith delivers an amazing performance as Chris Gardner, and this is a difficult role to master with all the emotional beats in the film. But in my opinion, the entire movie is a bit too dour. I know the point is seeing the hard road taken to achieve success, but we get such a brief moment of joy, that it can be tough to wait until the movie gets there. I still appreciate The Pursuit of Happyness, though, because all the despair makes the ending that much more powerful, and it\u2019s hard not to cry. It\u2019s not exactly a movie I\u2019ll want to seek out for multiple re-watches, but it is a solid story.",

            "content": "A fairy tale in realist drag, \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" is the kind of entertainment that goes down smoothly until it gets stuck in your craw. Inspired by a true story, as they like to say in Hollywood, the film traces the fleeting ups and frightening downs of Chris Gardner, whose efforts to keep his family from sinking into poverty evolve into a life-and-death struggle of social Darwinian proportions. It's the early 1980s, and while Ronald Reagan is delivering the bad economic news on television, Chris is about to prove you don't need an army to fight the war on poverty, just big smiles and smarts, and really sturdy shoes. (It also helps that the star playing him is as innately sympathetic as Will Smith.)\n\nGiven how often Chris breaks into a run on the streets of San Francisco, it's a good thing his shoes are well built; his lungs, too. Written by Steven Conrad and directed by Gabriele Muccino, \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" recounts how Chris, plagued by some bad luck, a few stupid moves and a shrew for a wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), loses his apartment and, with his 5-year-old, Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, Mr. Smith's own beautiful son), joins the ranks of the homeless, if not the hopeless. Evicted from the mainstream and bounced from shelter to shelter, Chris holds firm to his dignity, resolve, faith, love and independence. His optimism sweeps through the film like a searchlight, scattering clouds and dark thoughts to the wind.\n\nIt's the same old bootstraps story, an American dream artfully told, skillfully sold. To that calculated end, the filmmaking is seamless, unadorned, transparent, the better to serve Mr. Smith's warm expressiveness. That warmth feels truthful, as does the walk-up apartment Chris's family lives in at the start of the film, which looks like the real paycheck-to-paycheck deal. As does the day care center, which is so crummy it can't even get happiness right (hence the title).\n\nThis is no small thing, considering the film industry's usual skewed sense of economic class, a perspective encapsulated by the insider who described the middle-class family in \"Little Miss Sunshine\" to me as working class, perhaps because the mother drives a gently distressed Miata rather than next year's Mercedes.",

The awards the movie MTV Movie Award for best breakthrough performance, Teen choice award, NAACP Image award, and Phoenix film critics society award. The Languages spoken in the movie where English and Cantonese. The movies genre was Biography/Drama and the filming location was in Alameda California in the USA. I give this movie a 5/5. It had a very good message. The message was how even though he kept repeatedly failing he would always get back up and keep pushing forward. I would say this movie is very inspiring with really great actors.  Even at times when you thought he was going to give up he never did. \nThis movie is a true story about a man who is struggling to succeed in life while he has his young son with him. He does everything in his power to try to prove people that have doubt him wrong. Throughout the movie he had to overcome many setbacks which made him push harder and do better at success. He ties to do everything to give his son the best life possible. It's a very emotionally inspiring movie that will get you thinking long and hard about life. \nHow this movie inspired me was when Chris had to go through all these sometimes small and sometimes big setbacks. There where scenes when he had to do things just to make ends meet. There where times in the movie you could tell he was getting very frustrated and he didn't know what to do. There where times he would yell at his own son because of how frustrated he was. One of the reasons I think that this movie would be an excellent choice to watch is because of how real it seemed and how daily struggles can impact your life. Chris had something stolen from him twice but instead of just letting them take is he would chase them down and get it back. He is a very determined person that is very social and has a great personality those values got him to where he is now. I find it very interesting that as he's going through all these struggles he keeps a good head space and even when he has his son and when he's ending up being kicked out of where he's living he does let out some emotion and that's okay when your struggling the way he was. He got right back on his feet and went right back to working so he could reach to where people believe he couldn't \nI recommend that the people who are struggling and the people who have a dream and who really want to get somewhere in life to go and see this movie. It will inspire you to keep moving forward even when you do face many obstacles along the way. It's also a reminder that your going to be alone most of the time that's where you have to become independent and figure things out yourself. Even with all the obstacles he faced in life he chooses to keep going with dignity. I felt that the movie was very realistic. I feel like most people can could or can relate to this movie. Even though it was a true story it shows how one man raising one child faced so many set backs and faced so many failures that this man still proceeded to keep going forward to improve both his life and his sons. \n",

The heartful, emotional yet inspirational movie, 'The Pursuit of Happyness', 2006, directed by Gabriele Muccino and written by Steven Conrad, is definitely a film worth seeing. A biographical drama based on the true story of how Christopher Gardner faced many challenges while in pursuit to achieve success, stability and most of all, happiness. Set in the year of 1981 in the city of San Francisco, Christopher begins working an unpaid internship to land a position as a full-time stockbroker; while Christopher struggles with the crisis of being homeless. After loosing everything he has from his house to his savings, to his wife abandoning them, he begins the journey of survival. Through hard work and dedication to his son, Christopher Jr, he was able to achieve success to the extent of owning his own brokerage firm. Having the need to survive may be the key to achieving success. \"The future was uncertain, absolutely, and there were many hurdles, twists and turns to come, but as long as I kept moving forward, one foot in front of the other, the voices of fear and shame, the messages from those who wanted me to believe that I wasn't good enough, would be stilled.\", Christopher Gardner. Starring Will Smith as Christopher Gardner and his real-life son Jayden Smith as Christopher Jr., the picture of the struggle to rebuild a better future was portrayed. From the technology, set and production of this film to the way the actors relayed the emotions, was deeply moving. Overall, people should take the time to watch this film as it can open their eyes towards the problems our society is still faced with, such as homelessness. It is important to be reminded that regardless of any situation which may set you back, with determination and the will to take action, you can achieve your goals. It is a film worth viewing as the entire cast and production team were very precise in relaying their roles to exemplify the emotion and struggles of pursuing the American dream.",

I feel that nobody else would have been able to bring out the depression and all the other emotions of the character quite like Will Smith was able to. He was able to show the happiness and joy of his life being a single father. In the same sense he portrayed the struggles and hardships of single parenthood with such emotion that you felt like you were there in his life, like a friend, by his side, going through these same problems with him. If you have ever been in his situation you can definitely feel his sorrow and sadness.  Will Smith makes this movie the emotional roller coaster that will make you cry, laugh then cry again. \n\nIn the movie Will Smith's son, Jaden Smith, plays the role of his son.

There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes. In a particular scene, Smith is taking to his son at the basketball court and tells him \"Hey. Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. All right? You got a dream?

There is a phrase that I really liked, Chris Gardner told his son; never let anyone tell you that you cannot do something, not even me. Life puts us many obstacles but we have to be happy because happiness is the key to open new doors.",

Everyone in the past twelve years since its release that has recommended it to me can only talk about how sad and downright heartbreaking it can be at times. Why would I want watch a film like that? After sitting through The Pursuit of Happyness, I have my answer.\n\nChris Gardner (Will Smith) is just trying to make money and take care of his family. After investing his entire life savings in a company that goes nowhere, he decides to risk it all and go out for an unpaid internship with a stockbroking company. The message here is extremely powerful, a message he delivers to his son about halfway through the film: If you want something, go get it. And, in the process of getting it, don't let anyone tell you that you can't have it.\n\nThe film revolves Gardner's struggle to work for no pay and still manage to take care of his son. You can't help but admire his hustle. Despite numerous shortcomings and failed attempts, he continues to push toward his vision. It's inspiration at its finest. And, just as people warned me, it's also heartbreaking to watch. I mean, the guy can't seem to catch a break. Ever. He takes a step forward then eight back. I appreciated the film being delivered in this fashion because of how real it felt. I never got the sense of sugarcoating. This man was broken, yet he found a way to piece himself back together.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention Jaden Smith's performance as Chris jr. He carries the innocence and sadness of a kid that's a victim of a situation he doesn't seem to fully understand. While it's heartbreaking to see them struggle, it's heartwarming to watch them struggle together.\n\nMy one complaint would be the movie ending a bit too abruptly for my taste. Other than that, what a great film! I give it a 92.",

This film is based on a true story, a father learning to overcome some of the hardest trials in his lifetime. Willing to lose every materialistic thing if he has to as long as he gets to keep his son by his side. Avery meaningful, inspirational, and very well put together film. Will and Jayden Smith give us an outstanding performance leaving us wanting more. In movies, Will usually plays a manly, confident role and always does a very good job doing it. In the pursuit of happyness he is challenged with a different type of role than he usually plays, a very humble, poor, man that is struggling to hold his family together. In my opinion there's no better choice of actor to take on this role, he kills it! Plus, who doesn't like Will Smith?\n\nChris Gardner (Will Smith) faces crucial poverty and homelessness in the city of San Francisco while trying to support his 4-year-old son all at the same time. He invests most of his life savings on portable bone density scanners that are supposedly more efficient than your average X-rays. He goes around from clinic to clinic trying to figure out a way to sell them, but most of the time has no luck. He accepts an internship at financial institution Dean Witter, to later realize he will not be getting any money from this. He continues to do it because he knows this will give him experience and could help him get a better job in the future. His wife (Thandie Newton) gets frustrated about the lack of money her and Will are bringing home, due to the fact that it's not sufficient to pay the bills. She decides to pack up her stuff and completely abandons them. He has no money to pay rent, gets kicked out of his apartment, leaving him and his son with nowhere to go or sleep.\n\nWill Smiths son (Jaden) has a really interesting role in this movie; he plays a very smart and clever young boy. A very kind, and innocent character, the crowd loves him. He stays loyal to his father and right by his side thru all the hardships. He's a constant reminder to Will that as long as you have your loved ones by your side, you can get thru any trial your facing.  He also adds a lot of comedy to this film, his small sarcastic remarks is what the viewers love about him.\n\nThere's a crucial scene in the movie where Chris reaches a turning point in his life. He really hits the lowest of the lowest, I'm talking rock bottom. Him and his son have nowhere to go and have no other option but to sleep on the bathroom floor of a train station. In this scene Chris is sitting on the ground clinging on to his son as tight as he can while holding the bathroom door shut with his foot. Every material thing he had got taken from him, but he still has his son by his side, which is what he cares for most. He does what ever he can to keep his him safe, even if it means just holding him tight and being by his side. Chris starts sobbing; he's lost and has no idea if he will make it out of this nightmare we call life or not. He takes a looks at his son and realizes he has no other option but to keep fighting for the sake of him. He gains the strength and right mindset and knows that giving up is not an option.\n\nI won't ruin the ending for you guys, but overall, I loved this movie! The love that Chris Gardner shows for his child is so touching and like no other. Everything he does is for his son, so that he can grow up and have a better future. I highly recommend watching this movie!",

            "content": "The meaning of happiness isn't something learned over the entirety of a lifetime. It is discovered in moments of calm after persevering through months or years of unimaginable hardships, as they try to make out the light at the end of the tunnel. Gabriele Muccino attempts to recreate these moments through his movie, The Pursuit of Happyness; this sensational melodrama epitomizes the American Dream that millions have experienced through the biography of Chris Gardner's embattled life, as he struggles to make ends meet in San Francisco with his wife and kid.\n\nThe beginning scene opened on Gardner, happily strolling through the hills of San Francisco with a sewing machine under his arm. He had invested all of his savings into the clunky contraptions that could measure bone density; his main job was to haul them around San Francisco and convince physicians that they were worth the money. Over time, he began selling less and less, while his wife began taking more and more shifts at the dry cleaners; yet Gardner had repeatedly reassured his family that they would pull through, and against all odds come out on top. Their rent bills kept being pushed back, until one night, all hell broke loose. His wife abandoned him to get a job back east, his landlord kicked him out of his apartment, and no one needed his machines anymore. Gardner hit rock bottom. It was the tear-invoking moment in the movie, when, Gardner, homeless, jobless, sitting in the subway restroom and clutching his sleeping son, transforms the typical sob story into something more tangible. The genuinely heartbreaking display of emotions by Will Smith in that scene is one of the reasons this movie stands apart from the others. Gardner's only salvation was to set up camp in a homeless shelter, and survive an unpaid brokering internship, something he had been dreaming of doing. To do this, Gardner had to woo the job from Dean Witter, owner of the stock firm. His 5-minute cab-ride interview with Witter's aide revealed his quirky attitude and his unusual skills in mathematics and solving the Rubik's Cube, which charmed both the aide and the movie audience. Gardner got the job, and dutifully trotted off to secure a bed in the homeless shelter for himself and his son. The scenes in the homeless shelter, of Gardner bathing his(Will Smith's actual) son, telling him stories as he fell asleep, and standing proud amongst other broken men as they got their food, spoke to the paternally protective side of the audience.  It also spoke of Gardner's unnerving ability to see a future for himself and his son in which they would be happy, and this vision drives him to tackle each challenge as they come along. The lesson Gardner, and ultimately Will Smith, taught to his son, and Muccino taught to the audience, was that despite every possible thing that went wrong in Gardner's life, he would not stop trying for his son's future and \"happyness\". It was Muccino's and Smith's ode to parents present and past that kept getting up after they were kicked down.\n\nIn Gardner's eyes, the Pursuit of Happyness is the pursuit of perseverance in the face of ever-mounting odds. It is the unyielding paternal power that Will Smith masterfully portrays through the midlife crisis of Chris Gardner. The climax of the movie predictably but resoundingly proved this correct, as Witter quietly came up to Gardner on the last day of his internship to announce that he had gotten the job. That is the moment of pure euphoria that the audience had silently awaited and Will Smith portrayed as he clapped his hands and wept silent tears. The anguish that Gardner had gone through are what make this movie genuine and moving, and what separates it from the rest of the cookie cutter American Dream movies. It is the director's and screenwriter's exquisite detail to the sacrifices that Gardner had to make to end up where he was, and their attempt at answering his question. What is the meaning of happiness? Ultimately, I think Gardner answered that. It was that moment of relief, of stability, that Gardner felt as he pulled himself and his family one stable job closer to a happy ending.",

            "content": "This film has been praised by audiences and critics alike, and because it's based on a true story, it's hard for it to ever become dated. So, even 10 years after it first premiered, it still holds a special place in most people's memories. Looking back at this inspirational and real story of man and his son, I ask, are the morals taught in this movie to a worldwide audience, still valid? Or, is it just as emotionally manipulative as The Fault in Our Stars? I guess, like most things, it's something in between.\n?\nThe film centers on Will Smith and his real life son Jaden. He's a salesman, and his wife works in some sort of domestic job. They're barely making ends meet, and on top of all that, they have a five year old son. They feel as though the world is against them, but they have no idea how to get out of their slump. They thought they could achieve the American dream by getting rich quick - by selling bone scanners, but in fact, it's not as simple as that. Will and his wife separate, and Will is left alone to take care of his son. So because his first get rich quick scheme didn't work out, he decides to invest in another one. This time, he wants to become a multimillionaire stock broker. He signs up for a 9am-5pm internship that's unpaid for six months, and he has to win the full time position out of 20 other interns. The odds are clearly against him, but he rises to the challenge and gets the internship. Even though it breaks and drives him to the edge, he does whatever it takes to get himself and for his son out of poverty.\n\nIt's easy to like this premise. It's clearly about the American dream, which is, if you just try and work hard enough, (even if what you're doing is totally crazy, and irresponsible) things will work out for even the most disadvantaged people. It's important to remember that this is a story coming out from the 1980s, when the gap between the have and the have-nots was widening tremendously. So, for a man to pull this off is nothing short of a miracle. Viewers must also remember that this is a story about one man - one man out of millions of millions of people who want this dream too. But quite unfairly, the movie seems as though this can happen to anyone. That's where it gets problematic. Not everyone can pull themselves out of poverty, and become a multi millionaire. There are thousands of homeless people shown in the movie, but the movie doesn't show sympathy for them, just the main character. The people you are supposed to admire are the rich, white men, who Will so desperately wants to be. But in reality, if those rich people were actually nice, he would feel safe with telling them about his situation. They would be empathetic, rather than write him off. But we never see that. We never see Will explaining his situation, instead we see him trying to cover it up. We see the white wealthy men jerking him around by the neck, asking him to get coffee, spending five dollars he doesn't have, all the while rooting for Will to be one of them, and seeing the white men as the saviors of Will.\n\nOne thing I do like about the movie is that it shows how life can just pile up sometimes. My favorite scene in the movie is when Will has to go to the interview for the internship in painting clothes. First, he had to paint the apartment in order to get a longer grace period on his rent, and then the police came to his house because he had to pay parking tickets. When he was at the station, he had to stay overnight in the work clothes, and thus, had to go to the interview looking \"unprofessional.\" This perfectly illustrates how hard Will's life is, and how hard most people's lives are. Sometimes you can't help how hectic things get, and just have to go with the flow as best you can.  \n\nI also think the bone density machine is a good symbol, but maybe it's too obvious. His past is literally weighing him down, but it's the only thing that can help in have enough money to survive into the future. When the light bulb is fixed and goes on in the machine during one of Will's most trying times, it's clear that he can let his past go, and move on. I like it, but for me, it's just too obvious, same with the Captain America doll that Jaden loves so much. It's supposed to be ironic, these two poverty stricken men still believe in the \"American Dream.\" But later, when Jaden loses it running for the bus, I guess the director wanted to say that maybe we can't always have hope? It's ambiguous.\n\nBut with every good thing in the movie, there's an equally upsetting part. What takes me out of the movie most is the questionable parenting. I understand that it's hard to be a parent in a crucial situation. I've never been in poverty, but I just wonder why Will thinks that when he has almost zero dollars in his bank account, that's the time to risk it all. What does he have to lose? I don't know, maybe his son? I could understand if he was alone, and didn't have to be responsible for anyone but himself, but he also has a child, a growing child who needs attention and proper nutrition, a place to sleep. It's unfair to judge people who have it so hard, but I just find it irresponsible of the movie to show people that this is an \"inspiring tale.\" Put your needs in front of your kids' because it'll all work out in the end. What if he didn't succeed? Then he would just be seen as an asshole for not having a logical back up plan.\n\nI think it's also important to bring up the time period. They don't make many references to the 80s which is actually nice. It doesn't make the 80s feel like one big joke. They also talk about classism. In the 80s there was great prosperity for the wealthy, but the poorer seemed to be getting zilch. This can be seen in a few subtle scenes. One of them is when one of the higher ups at the company Will wants to work for, doesn't realize the importance a five dollar bill can make. For Will that's his and his son's dinner, but for the boss, that's pocket change. They also have another simple scene with wealthy people driving in a Mercedes convertible past the homeless shelter. I really like how they illustrate the class struggle. But rather than show what's keeping the poor people down, they glamorize the wealthy.\n\nTo wrap up, I like the movie. Of course it's realistic for that one person, but not realistic for everyone. I also think that Jaden and Will acted very well. No one felt out of place, and the acting was never forced. It was all really natural and believable. Lastly, let's talk about the title, The Pursuit of Happyness. I won't spoil why there's a \"y\" instead of an \"i,\" but it is obvious that this quote is from Thomas Jefferson from when he was writing the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson plays an important part of the story because Will quotes him so much. They also have close ups of nickels, where you can see Jefferson's profile. I do think it's important that he's in there. Not only because he wrote the title of the movie, but because he was all about individuality - being your own man, and making something for yourself without anyone else's help. It's solely up to the individual to rise up, which is exactly what happens in the film. Whether you agree with that or not, it's important to keep Jefferson in mind while viewing the film. Overall, I give the film an 8/10. It's well meaning, but the messages are manipulative.",

Smith's performance is unlike anything he has done prior to this, and his character is a likable, surreal one.\nChris Gardner tries to take care of his five year old son Christopher but struggles with financial issues, making a living off of selling bone density scales. He hopes to become a successful stock broker and trains in an competetive internship whilst balancing a consistently worsening homelessness. It's literally a rags to riches story.\nThe Pursuit of Happyness is honestly too heartfelt and surreal to dislike. The performances are outstanding, especially from Will Smith. His performances are often varied depending on the film but he delivers well in his role here and is a likable hard working protagonist. Smith can balance anger, sadness, and a lot of optimism very well and realistically. This was also the film debut of Smith's son Jaden, who as a kid is very cute and obviously has great chemistry with his father. As his film career goes on, however, we know how things can really change for him. The Pursuit of Happyness' story is uplifting and compelling, but at times is a little repetitive and predictable, too - there's tons of scenes where Chris loses a scale or it gets stolen and he is sidetracked because of it. Sometimes the plot is conflicted on striving towards Chris' broker goals or his spiraling homelessness. It balances it okay, but it's a little conflicted. The uplifting spirit of The Pursuit of Happyness and its great performances make it one of Will Smith's finest performances and films, and is definitely a great modern biopic drama.",

So I saw this film with a premeditated expectations and Pursuit of Happyness was up to my expectation. I first thought that this film would have been about racism, but it was about a family man who finds it hard to meet both ends. Actually a lot of family movies are made on India, especially on Kerala of which most of them are melodramatic, lacking in sense and forgettable. But this film was different, it made me laugh when it had to, made me feel sad when those moments came etc. I didn't really feel the usual melodrama. In fact, melodrama isn't bad isn't bad if you use it well. Mostly the family drama made in my hometown have a regular formula, the first half will be full of comedy and the second half will be full of weeping stuff, something we colloquially refer to as senti (sentiment ). So watching this film was bliss.\r\n \r\n                Will Smith again proves that he is a great actor. He develops great chemistry with his son Jaden Smith in this film. Jaden Smith is really cute in this film. He has the potential like his father. I was quite a surprise for me. I actually can't find any more words to write about this film, though I wish to do so. The supporting actors were all good, but I found Thandie Newton to be rather looking really old and unattractive.  She lacked the charm that she once had on Mission Impossible 2 (2000). I really liked this film, but unfortunately I have run out of ideas, sorry, so I decide to stop here. Also the direction involved keeps you far far away from being bored.",

How did this all begin?\n\nWell, It started with a man named Chris Gardner and his son Christopher who are being left behind by Chris's wife as they are now divorced. She goes to NYC while Chris and son stay in San Francisco trying to sell medical scanners. Unfortunately they are near bankrupt.\n\nWhile moving to the streets, Chris gets a job as a stockbroker. But is forced to try and survive with his son with no car, no money and barely a life. Chris Gardner in the end, becomes an iconic wall street legend. \n\nThe main problem is the entire cast and acting. Will Smith is excrutiatingly awful as the real life man Chris Gardner which this movie is based on. This movie could have been better if Smith never had such a dumbed down narrative.\n\nEveryone else is bad too. Including Jaden Smith in his debut film role as Christopher. Thandie Newton has some of the worst acting in a movie ever. All she is good at is to be a careless snob. \n\nConclusions? The performences are terrible, the score is over dramatic, It is too melodramatic, the story should have been treated better. The Farther and Kid relationship in Beasts Of The Southren Wild were better! The Pursuit Of Happyness has an ironic title and some depressing details and its a load.\n\n41/100 D+",

            "content": "Although the screenplay isn't so incredible and the balance between comedy and drama is irregular for a film with an uplifting message such as in this Chris Gardner biopic, The Pursuit of Happyness is essentially great for 2 main reasons.\n\nFirst, is the message. The Pursuit of Happyness succeeds at conveying the message that you should never give up on the pursuit of your own happiness, regardless of the painful situations the world may end up throwing at you. The upbeat as well as emotional musical score also keeps the story rolling and the fact that it is based on a true story is just Inspirational. It even had some decent comedic moments in there,\n\nThe Second reason is the acting, and whats truly incredible is an excellent performance from Will Smith in the greatest I've seen from him and a good turn from comedy and action roles. He achieves an immaculate level of emotional intensity and portrays Chris Gardner so flawlessly that he himself causes the movie to exceed high above mere melodrama. \nIn a great supporting role, Jaden Smith manages to hold his own with some good laughs and a cute kiddish charm. He also adds heart-wrenching drama to the story and displays the more talented side of America's youth. His performance outshines the chance for anyone to make accusations of nepotism at The Pursuit if Happyness.\n\nSo in e end, The Pursuit of Happyness is a great film that can succeed in reaching people of all ages and classes in society with an important message.",

Written by Steve Conrad (WeatherMan, The Promotion), and directed by Gabriele Muccino (Seven Pounds), comes the story of a man struggling to make ends meet, in which almost every choice leads him down another road with a problem to solve and overcome, while maintaining the will and strength to never give up on what you want.\n\nhttp://www.screensyndrome.com/pursuit-of-happ/",

But here, he pours his heart and his soul into the true life role of Chris Gardner.\n\nSimilarly, his son, Jaden Smith, performing as Christopher Gardner Jr, gives another great performance. I thinking having Will's real life son on the set gave that energy to the child, helping him bounce off his own father's emotions more effectively than if it was a different child with no emotional connection to Will.\n\nIt will certainly be interesting to see if we get a similar response from Jaden in \"After Earth\" next year.\n\nThandie Newton was less impressive, but she did the best she could with the material, as her character was not terribly well written.\n\nIn the end though, this film transcends the average film it could have been purely through the charisma of Will and Jaden Smith.",

The story is incredible, the acting is superb, the emotion never stops being powerful and in one scene of the movie, when Will Smith gets the official job where he finally gets paid money for his work, he cries and says \"Thank You\".

            "content": "While \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" sometimes falls into schmaltzy, over-the-top drama, what really saves it is the acting by Will and Jaden Smith. The film is set in 1981. Chris Gardner (Will Smith) invests all of his money into a stock of portable bone-density scanners, which he hopes to sell to doctors. Unfortunately, these prove very difficult to sell and eventually, his wife becomes fed up with the financial hardships brought on by this hare-brained scheme and leaves him and their young son Christopher (Jaden Smith). Eventually falling to the point of poverty where the father and child have to live on the streets, Chris determined to claw his way out of this hole.\nBoth actors really sell us on the hardships and moments of joy that their characters experience and it's satisfying to see them make their way through countless obstacles. As the movie passes by, you get more involved in it and you will be left cheering when they triumph over adversity. A movie that isn't as good would have added a villain or a rival for Chris Gardner (Will Smith's character) to compete with and this character would predictably have turned around at the very end to help our hero succeed. While this movie isn't perfect it doesn't fall into cheap and obvious trappings such as this. It's also a good film about a strong (and pretty realistic) father and son relationship, complete with all the not so glamorous patches. (Dvd, October 8, 2012)",

This shows how much it is important to chase your dreams... and protect it from others who doesn't even care for the dream you have.. \n\nI love how Chris raised his son with a great character even when his wife left them in the middle of adversity... and how he taught his son to be strong in following his heart. \n\nEven more, I love how he persevere in making his dream come true when he passed through all the hardships he experienced like running for his stuff, becoming homeless, sleeping in the church and worst in comfort rooms of public stations, but he never gave up.. Yet, he used this as learning experience in achieving his dream.. \n\nThis movie will teach us a lot about life's greatest lessons especially how you move towards your own happiness. Kudos to le Will and all the people who made this movie.. and to the real Chris Gardner who shared his life to us. He really is a role model of success.",

Being based on a true story, Will Smith plays a man named Chris Garner who has to raise his son by himself while attempting to get a job as a stockbroker. Will Smith's performance is certainly present and strong as a man who wants nothing more than to be happy. The ending is so bittersweet and uplifting which would make it impossible to be grumpy after watching it. I think the entire movie is very motivational, and a quote from Will Smith sums it all up: \"If you want something, go get it. Period.\"",

This is based on the true story of Chris Gardner - and it's a powerful film. \r\n\r\nChris Gardner (Will Smith) is living with his wife (Thandie Newton) and son Christopher (Jaden Smith) in San Francisco. He sells X-Ray machines to doctors for a living, but he is behind on bills due to the lack of profit he makes. He soon becomes interested in being a Stock Broker. He is able to land an internship at a prestigious stock brokerage firm. But when his wife leaves him, Chris is left to take care of his son alone. He is evicted from his apartment, and he and his son must endure hardships like being homeless and looking for shelter. This is a very sad story with some fantastic moments. The characters feel very realistic. The main thing that I loved about the plot was it's theme of happiness. The reason why Chris wanted to become a Stock Broker is becasue when he saw all those Stock Brokers leaving work - they looked happy, and he wanted to BE happy. There's a scene where Chris tells his son that if he was happy, Chris would also be happy. This passes down to his son, as in another scene at a resteraunt, we see Christopher looking at a happy family and then we see him smile. He was happy that they were happy, and then the camera shows Chris with a proud look on his face that his son was such a good kid. I loved the way they conveyed these themes. Another part of the film that I liked was the father/son relationship between Chris and Christopher. They showed the bond in scenes so very well.\r\n\r\nWill Smith never ceases to amaze you with his performance. It was very good. Jaden Smith was so cute as christopher, and he really is Will Smith's son. that's probably why this film felt so real. Because there really was a father and son acting in it. Thandie Newton was terrible as the wife. The way she screams is horrifying. She was very BAD.\r\n\r\nI loved the direction here. Gabriele Muccino has done a great job with the film. The drama and humour is directed very well. I liked some of the music. The theme song was really catchy.\r\n\r\nThis is sad, funny and it's also a feel-good film. There's so much happiness with this film. Loved the acting from Will and Jaden Smith. They work really well together. The script works and so does the dialogue. Highly Reccomended.",

Eventually, he finds his way into an unpaid internship at an investment firm, where he seeks something more substantial out of life. In reality, this is really the Will Smith show. The actor is a long way from his wise-cracking \"Fresh Prince\" days here, displaying the depth and raw emotional presence that reminds us all why he became such a big star in the first place. The director, Gabriele Muccino, who was hand-picked by Smith to helm this picture, also shows a steady hand throughout and avoids sinking this ship into the murky waters of tired melodrama. Add an adorable performance from a younger Jaden Smith, and I'll give this borderline tearjerker a thumbs up.",

This is easily one of Smith's best films, as he pours his heart and soul into the main character. While the plot may remain transparent, it leaves you asking the question of yourself - how long would you keep battling to get what you really want out of life? I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings. As I saw it then, it needed very few, if any, changes.",

Will Smith's acting makes Chris Gardner such a colourful and likeable character. Not for a second are audiences ever taken away from their emotion. I especially liked the very last scene, where his success is never depicted. Happiness is not from the end result, but the fruition of your pursuit.",

We think we have obstacles and tough times and keep losing and losing, but the protagonist here finds himself in places so low that you see why some people never made it back.  Perhaps if they had the determination and fire of Chris Gardner, they would.\n\nThat said, this is definitely worth a viewing.
