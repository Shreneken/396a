Director Guilliemo Del Torro directs with briskness and deep understanding of the film. The film looks gorgeous, very beautiful in one scene, and quite Gothic in another. Another director I can think of that directs visually stunning films is Ridley Scott. The music score by Javier Navarette is haunting, poignant and beautiful. The script is very mysterious, suspenseful and genuinely moving at times, and there are some genuinely memorable characters, the idealistic protagonist, the brutal stepfather, the pregnant mother and the caring housemaid. Here is one of the few fantasies where the images stay with you forever. There are beautiful costumes and a stunning forest set, the labyrinth is very Gothic and dark, as is the wise and mysterious faun, and the war and torture scenes are unashamedly graphic. Another honourable mention should go to the monster that tricks children into eating his food when he is asleep, and then he wakes up and eats them. He was so terrifying, the very look of him, made my blood run cold. He is one of the most terrifying creatures I have ever seen in the history of film. All in all, a visually stunning and absolutely magnificent film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox.",

He couldn't think of sacrificing the girl. This theory came when I was thinking about colors. The main colors are blue and yellow, but our expectations are completely crushed when you realise that blue isn't the \"cold, bad color\" but the color of calmness, of imagination and love for fairytales. The yellow is the color of war and chaos (fire, light casted on characters, the room of the officer). The scene in the kingdom, is I'd say the most important one in the film, because it captures the hypocrisy of \"the good place\" (no, not the TV show. just an idea of a place with no lies or pain) The place is overly yellow, creating stress and anxiety. For this world to be true there has to be pain. There can't be a concept of good without bad.",

            "content": "A magical world that only Guillermo Del Toro could imagine for us.\n\nGuillermo Del Toro's legendary dark fantasy horror film Pan's Labyrinth (2006) is a wonder of impeccable filmmaking. From the haunting practical effects for The Faun to the terrifying Pale Man costume, Pan's Labyrinth provides a fantasy realm of magical creatures as well as a brutally realistic Spanish war drama. Guillermo's direction is staggering with his fascinating imagery, gorgeous visuals, childlike wonder, shocking depiction of war crimes, and scary monsters. The question he poses is really who are the true monsters in Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nGuillermo's writing is fantastic with heartfelt empathy of his young heroine and sympathy for those lost in the war. You are always on edge as to what will happen next in Guillermo Del Toro's dark fantasy. Pan's Labyrinth is nothing like you've ever seen. I love how Guillermo has a young innocent girl witness atrocity after atrocity in quiet horror as we see as viewers how trauma forms in children during warfare.\n\nEditor Bernat Vilaplana's cuts are so dreamy as scenes melt into one another for 118 minutes of wonder. Cinematographer Guillermo Navarro uses cool blues and greens for a mysterious and haunting look, while a warm and scary look for the war and horror sequences. I love the chilling close-ups on creatures, especially the Pale Man being disgusting. \n\nI adore The Fawn. He's my favorite film creature prosthetic with his mystical figure and Doug Jones' majestic movements and intriguing gestures. Jones gets you curious as The Fawn, so that he can terrify you as the Pale Man. I think Doug Jones deserved an Oscar for his enigmatic and enthralling Fauno alone, not to mention his unforgettable Pale Man. I loved child actress Ivana Baquero as the adorable and compelling Ofelia. You feel all her fear, wonder, and curiosity within Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nEugenio Caballero's production design creates a real fantasy world with his stellar sets. Pilar Revuelta and Laura Musso's set decoration is fabulous with wood and leaves to adorn Guillermo's fantasy land with realistic things. Everett Burrell's visual effects are some of film's finest ever with believable wounds and strange creature enhancements. Composer Javier Navarrete's score astounds me every time I hear his haunting melodies that create a magical fantasy world with his mystic sounds. I could listen to Pan's Labyrinth's score on its own, it's that wondrous. \n\nLala Huete and Roc\u00edo Redondo's costume design is phenomenal with realistic war uniforms to inspired creature outfits. The make-up for The Fawn and the Pale Man is truly outstanding work from artists Jos\u00e9 Quetgl\u00e1s, Montse Rib\u00e9, and David Mart\u00ed.\n\nIn conclusion, Pan's Labyrinth is one of cinema's greatest achievements with sterling craftsmanship, horrifying practical creatures, poignant war commentary, and emotional childlike wonder like few could genuinely understand like Guillermo. I simply adore Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth.",

            "content": "Guillermo Del Toro's \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is a bold, heartfelt and whimsical fairy-tale war drama that showcases the filmmaker at his imaginative peak. With his sixth feature, Mexican filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro created a mesmerizing fantastical drama that proved him to be a master of combining fantasy with reality. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to fantasize a fairy-tale world from the imaginative perspective of a child, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using spellbinding cinematography, Del Toro draws viewers into an imagintaive girl's journey to explore a mystical world amid Spanish Civil War. Del Toro's decision to shoot the film using practical effects rather than CGI is risky, but it works tremendously. It lends realism and authenticity to the character designs of fantastical creatures, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. Del Toro exhibits extraordinary control over production design, visual effects and musical score, using these elements to craft imaginative cinematic experience. Del Toro's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses voice-over narration to tell the fantastical story from an innocent girl's perspective. It's hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Ivana Baquero gives one of the best child performances as Ofelia. With enchanting expressions, she conveys the innocence, naivety and curiosity of a girl that seeks comfort in a fantastical world in a country torn apart by war. The supporting cast, which is filled out by Del Toro collaborator Doug Jones, is also excellent and worthy of recognition.  Although \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is undeniably an unforgettable fantasy drama, ultimately it isn't a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it's undermined by an ambiguous ending. Del Toro's decision to conclude the movie with the death of a central character is bold and unexpected, but it doesn't fully work. Nevertheless, fans of the filmmaker will definitely enjoy \"Pan's Labyrinth\" and so will movie-goers seeking enchanting entertainment. At a time when wartime stories are seldom told from kids' viewpoints, it's a magical reminder that fantasy can ignite hope amidst war from one of the world's greatest Mexican filmmakers.",

Many of the images have since become iconic, such as the large-horned faun and the pale creature with eyeballs embedded in the palms of its hands. It's clear how much effort went into just getting the aesthetics right, I'm surprised there was time to focus on anything else. I felt that the film dragged at times, and despite the title we don't actually spend that much time in the labyrinth itself. Most of it is spent above ground, witnessing the exploits of a snarling, sadistic military leader. I would have liked to get to know the underworld better, and maybe even have another mythical character or 2 that could further add to the mystique. Will that said, its easy to see why it has the reputation it does, and I'm glad I finally got round to seeing it.

A visually stunning movie, from the fashionable fascist uniforms (think Spanish Nazis) to the incredible practical effects that bring Guillermo del Toro's magical realism to life. The most recognizable character is the titular Pan (or Faun, Spanish title being: El laberinto del fauno) played by Doug Jones, voiced by Pablo Ad\u00e1n. The other noteworthy, magical character \u2014 more like something out of a child's nightmare or Brothers Grimm story \u2014 is \"The Pale Man\" (also, Doug Jones). While eyeballs in your hands somehow overcame practical evolution, the Pale Man's singular scene is haunting and pertinent to our protag's plot. Ofelia (Ivanna Baquero) embarks on a three-part quest in the universe that exists outside of her reality; a reality that includes living in a barracks filled with Francoist soldiers and a new evil step-father (Sergi L\u00f3pez) hunting rebels in central Spain 5 years after the Spanish Civil War. I think the first time I viewed the movie, I was too interested in the fantastical elements and didn't pay enough attention to the excellent story taking place in real life. It is a story of resistance, cruelty, and sacrifice. Our human villain, Captain Vidal, Ofelia's new step-father, engages in the sorts of evil tactics you'd expect from a fascist captain hunting rebels in the mountains of central Spain. The ending was a little weird, as Ofelia being a literal princess was, for some reason, surprising to me. However, her final test was the perfect bow on this gripping film.",

The girl wasn't surprised that these magical beings existed, she blindly went along with all of the weird creature's requests, she stupidly ate some grapes for no reason despite being told not to, and the book the girl was reading from felt like it was written by a 10 year old. The plot was predictable from the beginning, there were numerous ridiculous plot points, the design of the creatures was poorly thought out (e.g. why would you have eyes in your hands?), the story was muddled between the real world and some delusional fantasy world, and the other world shown at the end looked completely fake due to bad visual effects. The girl was a rubbish character who had no development, but the rest of the characters were better. The captain was easily the star of the show. The combat was entertaining, but there wasn't enough of it due to the fantasy side plot.

Her stepfather, Captain Vidal, runs the outpost with an iron fist and a violent temperament.  To escape, she enters a portal and finds herself in an underworld filled with fairies and fauns, where she is believed to be the long-lost Princess Moanna.

(REST OF REVIEW EN INGLES) So Del Toro does it again in this dark and dark and gothic tragic fantasy/war film. This is so fascinating that this really happened back then. We really think that Faun should get his own spinoff series, kinda like the Minions from \"Despicable Me.\" It could be like Faun goes to Vegas, Faun goes to College, Faun goes to Cooking School, etc...He was a cool character and Johnny Depp probably could have played him just as good as Mike Jones did it. Of course, he's going to be in every Del Toro movie though! They're a good team 'cause Del Toro eats all of Jones' portions to make sure he stays at a lean popcorn physique/bf% to play these weird creatures like Faun or Hellboy's friend or the love interest thing in Shape of Water that is such a stud. Faun could have a buddy cop movie with Kevin Hart or something, who knows! Some strong performances also by the main actress as the kid who has an ambiguous ending to her story (did she go to the fantasy world or just die?), and also by the mean captain/bad guy/Mexican Joker's great great Grandpa. Popcorn connections? There were so many! 1) Napoleon Dynamite (Pedro), 2) Hellboy and all other Del Toro flicks (all in same universe, he has never debated this), 3) Hollywood/Deep state child sacrifices and soul-selling, and 4) Blood In, Blood Out ('cause it's like Faun is jumping her into a gang basically). It's also like Bong Joon's movies because they're not in English, and you're instantly more intelligent for watching them and having to read for a few hours. I feel smarter already! Hopefully Del Toro keeps cranking these movies out. He needs to do \"Spawn\" or do a sequel to \"Twins\" with Faun and Terry Crews or Kevin Hart or something.",

This movie is a very real and brutal look at war and the toll it takes on an imaginative child desperate to escape a dismal situation and a sadistic stepfather.  Quite frankly, it was incredibly depressing.  There is an element of fantasy here, though it does not dominate the movie in any form.  I wasn't geared up for a war movie at all but at a certain point I realized that I was watching exactly that.  It's a tragedy as seen through the eyes of adults and a little girl who is the heroine here.  I'm telling you in advance, it's in Spanish because I know some people may not be tipped off or inclined to \"read a movie\".  All the elements of a good film are here--casting, acting, directing, storytelling, special effects, costumes, etc.  I'm rather conflicted about my feelings towards the ending but I won't divulge the details here.  I consider this to be 3/5 stars as I've seen better films and much better, but RT describes three stars as \"Meh.  It passed the time.\" and I think it's better than that.  I would recommend watching but know what you're getting yourself into.  There's not a lot of \"wonderland\" here.  Perhaps in the literary sense, but not in the literal sense in the context of a fantasy film.  Does RT consider torture as an adult element of a \"wonderland\" in their synopsis?  I, for one, was not anticipating such.  There's a confused, terrified and grief-stricken child in the center of this story that has an underlying fairy tale.  You can decide for yourself which prevails here--reality or fantasy.  Enjoy!  It was an interesting take on traditional war movies to say the least.",

There was a bunch of cross-over, of course, but the sub-plots still felt a little disconnected from each other. The cgi and puppetry/make-up crossovers were also a little much for my taste, but it did compliment the film really well. I hated the Pale Man, not a fan at all, but the effect he had on screen was very nice. I also loved all the symbolism and imagery in the film itself. I loved Mercedes, her cleverness, wit, and strength, and the actress who played her. Overall was a quality film and it was enjoyable to watch. I would watch again, but skip the pale-man scenes. \n\tI also have to go on a little tangent here. Del Toro states that it was all actually real, not just in Ofelia's head. During the film, when Mercedes went to rescue Ofelia from the attic and she wasn't there, seeing the chalk door on the wall, indicated to me that it was all real because there was no other way out. He did state this as one of the reasons in his interview, as well as the labyrinth opening for her and the plum blossom blooming at the end. However, I really don't think he should have made it all be real. If you make it all real, it takes away from an important message of trying to escape from a harsh reality using your imagination, and how the mind copes with certain situations. That's just my opinion. Some might say it is better that it is all real because it means Ofelia gets a happy ending or for other reasons.",

The characters are well developed, the plot points are well connected, and the overall feel of the movie from the shots to the setting is well done (am I saying 'well' too much?). Guillermo Del Toro pulls off a masterful job of weaving all these parts into a compelling, emotional, and charming film. You've likely seen it, but if you haven't, you can stream it on Netflix.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers. \nThe film Pans Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro was released in 2006. Guillermo in this film focused mainly on how women are being belittled and oppressed by men. With this film he wanted to show that even the man you are married to can do the same to you. The film had a lot of themes present but the one that stood out the most was misogyny. Misogyny is the act of mistreatment, harassment, hostility and sexual objectification of women by men. Captain Vidal throughout the film participated in this act. His first trait of misogyny is brought about when he forces his wife Carmen to sit on a wheelchair because she is pregnant. Hostility to women is also brought out when his stepdaughter Ofelia offers him her left hand and he squeezes it hard without even considering she is just a child.\nMisogyny is also brought out during dinner when the ladies asked Carmen how they met. Captain Vidal apologizes to the ladies for Carmen boring them with her story. In this case we see him degrading and disrespecting her and her opinion in public. During this time, we also see difference in social class. Carmen was just tailor's wife who became widowed and remarried. The ladies at the table agreed with him and accepted his apology because all of them came from well off families.\nSexual objectification is brought about when Carmen goes into early labor. when the doctor tells Captain Vidal about the situation, he feels like it is his decision to decide who should live or die. In this case he chooses his unborn son even if it meant the mother dying. In my opinion, I don't feel like it is a man's place to decide this. It should either be both parties or just the mother because it is her life on the line. It is unfortunate Carmen didn't get a say in this.\nMercedes was one of the guerrilla rebels, but she managed to spy and live with Captain Vidal unnoticed because she is a woman. This attitude he has for women allowed Mercedes to sneak up on him, stab him, slit his mouth and escape.\nThe film was intriguing to watch because of how it was unfolding and the turn of events. It was easy to follow through and the themes present were easy to identify, because they are relatable to our day to day life.",

Toro beautifully integrates elements of fantasy into the films reality and truly captures the world through a child's eyes. This integration leaves the audience wondering what is real and what is imaginary. By the end of the film, it his strongly suggested that the fantasy elements are just Ofelia's coping mechanism, to give her meaning to her suffering. So while the film is tragically beautiful, the fantasy elements pose issues to the integrity of the characters. If it was all imaginary, then Ofelia's character has absolutely no survival instincts as her character constantly makes life harder for herself. She constantly defies the captain and her mother in the name of her quest, so she is making them angry for no reason.\nShe even shows this lack of  discipline for rules she has created in the fantasy world that ultimately get her into more pretend danger than in reality. This makes her survival instinct to retreat to her imaginary world impractical and ultimately fatal. Despite this deep character flaw, which is very aggravating, The film is still absolutely mesmerizing and there are many ways one can choose to interpret the film.",

            "content": "Reviewed 6.7.19  Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece is a wildly creative fable for grown-ups, those with a stomach for realism, as he pulls no punches, neither emotionally or with the level of grotesque violence.  The early scene with sadistic Captain Vidal brutally murdering two unfortunate rabbit hunters is truly disturbing.  As is the manner of passing for almost every 'good' character.  That said, beauty abounds.  The faun, the fairies, the creatures, everything is brilliant and expressive.  \n\nThe script mines many old fairy tales, along with some modern stories (very dark versions of Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter), but retains its own magical identity.  Ofelia, the main protagonist, is acted soulfully by 11-year old Ivana Baquero.  Like all the characters in del Toro's parable, she faces a life and death decision, yet refuses to disobey her own inner voice.  Each character is defined by their choice.  The doctor that honors his code over his safety.  Mercedes, played with verve by Maribel Verdu, is the adult heroine that fights for a cause that may be hopeless.   Even Captain Vidal (Sergei Lopez channeling true evil) lives by his own strict code, as demonic as it may be. \n\nIt's this rigidness that leaves aspects of the characters and their backstory feeling underdeveloped.  But the simplicity matches the fairy tale intent, while the mood presents its own dichotomy, with equal parts dread and wonder.   It's masterfully directed, by an artist with extraordinary potential.  And you won't soon forget it, even if you wish you could.  It's like a kick in the gut from a magical fairy.",

This film takes the concept of a fairy tale for grown-ups in a very interesting direction. I genuinely didn't know what direction the story was going to take, and I think that is what kept me watching more than anything else. The movie didn't grab my interest right away but close to the halfway point, I became very invested in the characters. The movie showcases one of the most menacing villains I've seen and I was genuinely afraid every second he was on screen. The way the film uses fantasy elements to tell a very human story is fascinating and is truly a showcase of del Toro's ability to create a strange yet absorbing world.",

Shots, though standard at times, flow and transition with grace, never giving the viewer a sense of vertigo, and always contain the information needed to give the viewer the full picture. In addition, the actress portraying Ofelia is quite excellent for a child actor, even acting opposite of CGI constructs with at least a passable level of skill. In all, a highly competent film on all levels, save for a small smattering of characters who could have used a little more time in the oven to be as fully realized as needed.",

Del toro brings us many references to the harming of children such as Kronos devouring his children (The Pale Man) and the pile of shoes referencing the piles of children shoes found after the liberation of Nazi Concentration camps and thus highlights Ofelia (a reference to Shakespeare's Hamlet) and her need to avoid rationalising the world around her. \n\nDel toro gives us a beautifully crafted insight into the world of fairy tales and how they can be used by children to craft a new reality of a utopian and perfect world, as they world they live in cannot be.",

It's not like this is a garbage movie...it was just SO disappointing- and frustrating as Hell. \nFirst of all, this always shows up on lists of 'the greatest horror movies' and a horror it was not. At times creepy, yes, but this is no horror. Also, The description leads you to believe it's a fantasy in which a girl spends the movie making her way through a labyrinth, but that was such a small part of it... \nFinally, I just really can't stand films that use very unrealistic actions (on the part of the characters) to propel the story forward. I'm not talking about 'fiction' unrealistic (like fauns and labyrinths and fairies). I mean when someone does something they would just never do, to make the plot continue in the way it needs to. I feel like it's lazy writing and I find it so frustrating. \nSome examples (here's where the spoilers start):\n-why in the blue Hell would she eat the grapes? She's a smart girl and she did everything else she was told, and they were VERY clear that she couldn't eat anything. 'I didn't think anyone would notice'?!?! It's just so silly. Also, she stands there savoring the grapes as though she has all the time in the world (waving the fairies off- also ridiculous) when she knows her time is very limited. And then she's able to draw a door to get out even though he was firm that she had to return before the sand ran out. Convenient. This was the point that I started constantly checking how much time was left in the movie because it didn't seem to be getting better. And it didn't. \n-it makes absolutely zero sense that Mercedes did not kill the captain. Why on earth would she spare him? Again, just silly. \n-why did Ofeli get a second chance? The whole point was that they needed to make sure it was her, and that she needed to complete the tasks to prove so. She fucked up, so why the retry? \n-there is NO reason she should have put the chalk down on the table. Why would she do that? Only so that the captain would find evidence of her being there. Lazy writing.\n-could she have moved any slower taking the baby? She knew she was in a hurry yet she took her time with the drops, gave a speech to her brother and then stood stupidly in the doorway until the captain turned around and saw her. *eye roll* \nThe story couldn't have happened without the characters making several ridiculous choices, and that, for me, makes an unenjoyable movie.",

But, surprisingly, I hadn't watched it until this fall after seeing his new movie The Shape of Water at the Toronto International Film Festival. And, even after hearing about its brilliance for so many years, I realized that it was a good idea that I waited.\n\nThis is simply because I am so easily terrified by even a hint of horror on screen. No, seriously. I couldn't even watch Supernatural episodes without hiding under the covers. Pan's Labyrinth is not a horror film by any means, but it's majorly unsettling and twisted. I wanted to hide multiple times. But this time I couldn't look away. It is mesmerizing and excruciatingly beautiful.\n\nAn old labyrinth is the center around which little Ofelia's (Ivana Banquero, The New Daughter) dire reality becomes entwined with fairy tale. She discovers the labyrinth when she moves with her pregnant mother to live on a military base in Falangist Spain in 1944 with the menacing Captain Vidal (Sergi L\u00f3pez, Dirty Pretty Things), her new stepfather. At the center of the labyrinth, Ofelia meets an old faun (Doug Jones, Hell Boy, The Shape of Water), a Greek mythological creature, with the body and head of a man, but legs and spiraling horns of a goat.\n\nThe faun spins a tale for her. He has been searching for her through the centuries. She is the lost princess of the Underworld. Before returning to her kingdom, she must perform three tasks to prove her royal heritage. In the unfolding events, Ofelia's fairy tale is ensnared with reality. Danger lurks both in the fantastical and the mundane.\n\nA contrast in the vivid color which paints Ofelia's interactions with mythical creatures and the colder scenes of the \"real world\" distinguishes fantasy from reality. But Pan's Labyrinth plays with light and dark imagery to create a dizzying vividness throughout. Watching each frame is like being sucked into a Goya painting. None of it, the set nor the filming, is perfect or neat. It's bewildering, intense, and rich. I was totally immersed.\n\nOfelia's desire for an escape was heartbreaking. But, just maybe, her enchanted world is more than imagination. The message of Pan's Labyrinth is surprisingly simple. There is magic, love, and strength hidden even in the coldest bits of our realities. For me, a mere mortal with no mythical heritage to escape to, (only covers to hide under), Del Toro has offered a glimmer of hope.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/pans-labyrinth.

The scenes at the labyrinth look very genuine.  The cast also for the most part does a very good job though that is not without its problems.  The character of Ofelia's evil stepfather is a bit of a formulaic contrivance.  That being said I found myself interested in where the story would go and it kept me guessing as to how it would and I liked that.  As I have said \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is not the most original movie I have ever seen, but it it is worth seeing.",

            "content": "Pan's Labyrinth, an exotic fantasy film directed by Guillermo del Toro, takes the audience on an exhilarating ride through Ofelia's adventurous yet mysterious life. Set in 1944, in post-civil war Spain, it tells the story of a young girl, Ofelia, and her pregnant mother as she goes to live with her step-father, Captain Vidal, a cruel captain of the Fascist army. The film revolves around her encounters with the mysterious faun who gives her three exhausting tasks to prove herself to be the princess of the underworld and get to meet her real father. Although at first glance it may appear to be an ordinary fantastical film with mystical creatures, the creatures are much significant representatives of the real world. The film evades lingering false consciousness pertaining to fantasy and transgresses boundaries between that which is real and that which is unreal. This blurring of boundaries is not only present in contextual levels but is also delivered through form. Del Toro showcases military tensions in fascist Spain and the aftermath of the civil war on its citizens as they oppose the regime. Through the usage of time as a symbol and the presence of various genres and references to other works, the film comes about to be heavily reliant on postmodernism. Pan's Labyrinth utilizes elements of false consciousness coupled with evasion of boundaries and postmodernism to provide a real-life dimension to a film that could be easily \"dismissed as child's play beyond serious study\" (Butler 2). \n\nThe presence of supernatural creatures embodies the \"treatment of children by society, with the creatures encountered by Ofelia [played by Ivana Baquero] being representations or transformations of 'political power'\" (9). Furthermore, 'The Pale Man' is portrayed as a devourer of children and figuratively, a societal representation of a figure who manipulates children's innocent minds. On a formal level, Del Toro draws inspiration from Francisco De Goya's art as his painting, Saturn Devouring His Son showcases Saturn, fearful his sons will overpower him, consuming each of them. \n\nIn another instance, Del Toro also utilizes De Goya's painting, The Third of May, 1808: The Execution of the Defenders of Madrid in a scene where Captain Vidal, played by Sergi L\u00f3pez, shoots a falsely-suspected spy and as the victim's father lashes out at Vidal, the state of mind of the citizens unravels. As evident by the title of the painting, the citizens are shown to be against the Franco Regime and attempt to overthrow the authoritarian ruler. Therefore, both the painting and the scene illustrate an overall theme of a rebellion by the repressed in the film. Likewise, Ofelia and Mercedes represent the repressed citizens under the Franco rule. Through this, Del Toro also illustrated that the repressed rebels don't have to be adults and that children can also oppose and stand up for themselves. \n\nThe color scheme of the film also draws influence from Francisco de Goya's paintings and upon further analysis, it is not surprising that the film contains multiple references to his paintings as De Goya is notable for paintings pertaining to Spanish wars and their aftermath on the ordinary citizens. Hence, in this manner, Del Toro not only transgresses boundaries between reality and fantasy but also evades the false consciousness about fantasy films containing no more significance than being merely children's imaginations. It opens the minds of the audience to look past the status quo and accept that fantastical elements are visually-appealing ways to portray much more deeper thoughts about the events taking place in the real world. The viewers may then conclude that Del Toro also transgresses boundaries between fiction and non-fiction as fictional elements are being used to infiltrate the non-fictional world. Furthermore, the paintings and the film also invoke an open dialogue between one another, thereby transgressing temporal\u00a0boundaries that confine the paintings and the film to a particular era. In addition to this, false consciousness is also relevant to the ending of the film. Albeit, typically in fantasy films, the evil is killed but it is arguable if the ending was indeed a happy one as Ofelia got to see her parents and return to her palace but at the same time, there are multiple lives claimed throughout the film. Hence, false consciousness about the clich\u00e9d endings in fantasy films is clearly evaded in Pan's Labyrinth. \n\nTime encapsulates itself as a recurring symbol in Del Toro's film. Captain Vidal would constantly look at his pocket watch and even comments, early on in the film, how Ofelia and her mother are exactly fifteen minutes late. The usage of the hour glass when Ofelia is trying to accomplish one of her tasks and the timeliness involved in the tasks further illustrates the importance of time in the film. Furthermore, towards the ending of the film, Captain Vidal asks Mercedes to tell his son the exact time he was killed which shows how Captain Vidal was imprisoned by time in the entire film. Moreover, the fact that the film is told in reverse initially and later goes in chronological order reflects on the time-bending capabilities of the film. In addition to this, boundaries between genres are also clearly infringed as Del Toro utilizes elements of horror, mystery, adventure in a war-like context cumulatively told through a fairy tale. The presence of time distortion and the usage of multiple genres is clearly indicative of Pan's Labyrinth being a postmodern film. In addition to this, the presence of pastiche through the usage of paintings as influences for the film is another identifier of postmodernism in the film. \n\nDespite being a fantasy film, Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, exercises elements of false consciousness, transgression of boundaries, opposition by the oppressed and postmodernism elements, formally and contextually, to give rise to a story that is much more than mere imagination. It is a powerful mystification of the real world that ensures the audience leave the theatre with an eye-opening perspective on fantastical thrillers.",

            "content": "If there's one person who made me fall in love with fantasy and creatures, it's Guillermo del Toro. As much as I remember in my childhood life, I was completely fascinated by the trailer when I first saw it. Unfortunately, my mother wouldn't allow me to watch it, due to its graphic images. The good news, however, was that I got the chance to see \"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\" after \"Pan's Labyrinth\" was made, and I became so impressed with it when it first came out. As a teenager, every time I look at del Toro's creatures or his design, it does make me want to pick up my sketch book and start drawing my own creatures. By the time I was old enough, I finally got the chance to watch \"Pan's Labyrinth\", and for what I can say is that it's about as rich and beautiful as I'd expect when I was young at the time.\n\nSet in Spain, 1944, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) are going to live with her sadistic stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Around nighttime, Ofelia encounters a fairy who guides her through the labyrinth, and this is where she meets the Faun (Doug Jones). He tells her that she is the reincarnation of a princess from the Underworld. In order for her to become immortal, Ofelia must complete three tasks before the full moon rises.\n \nIt has been said to many critics and people that \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is \"Alice in Wonderland\" for grown-ups. But unlike \"Alice in Wonderland,\" we never see the protagonist traveling through the fantasy world throughout the film. Instead, we just see her going back and forth to the real world and the fantasy world. While Ofelia is given to complete three tasks by the Faun, the film also focuses on a small group of soldiers, led by Pedro (Roger Casamajor), as they're fighting against Captain Vital and his army. Much like del Toro's previous film, \"The Devil's Backbone,\" it does share the similarities on its themes and characters, but what makes this better is that the details to its narrative are more beautifully done, and his creatures are both unique and marvelous to look at, especially the Pale Man, (who's also played by Doug Jones).\n\nThe performances are exceptional. Newcomer Ivana Baquero embodies Ofelia as an innocent girl who's doing something that may change her life forever, and she does it wonderfully good. Even though I've heard Sergi Lopez has been playing comedic roles before he was playing the villain in this picture, his portrayal as Captain Vidal has left me unsettled. Vidal is about as evil and vicious as Robert Mitchum in \"The Night of the Hunter.\" He treats Ofelia like a brat who gets in his way, and has no love for Ofelia's mother. All he ever wants from her is her baby boy, which he happens to be the father of him. Another performance that should never be forgotten is Maribel Verdu, (better known from \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\"), as Mercedes, one of the housekeeper who's secretly helping his brother, Pedro, and his small army. The scenes between her and Ofelia are absolutely effective to watch. Doug Jones, (who has worked with del Toro before), is very memorable by playing two separates characters as the Faun and the Pale Man.\n  \nEven though it took home three Oscars, it's a real shame that it never got nominated for Best Picture. Luckily, another favorite film of mine that was made in the same year as this one, \"The Departed,\" has took home four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. This is a wonderful fantasy film that manages to be distinguish and refreshing from start to finish. The imagination of \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" a dark fairy tale that goes back and forth between reality and fantasy, is something to behold. 10/10.",

I remember seeing the film and loving it when it first came out, but I never got a chance to rewatch it over the last 10 years. It was time for me to get back to that labyrinth and the fantastical world del Toro has created.\n\nNow it is official: \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is one of the greatest fantasy movies of all time. It is also one of the saddest films I've ever seen.\n\nThe thing that struck me the most is how dark and brutal this story is. Although it certainly has some fantastical elements that take you to a different world, its core is firmly rooted in the reality of war and how that brings nothing but tragedy to everyone's lives. It is a perfect anti-war film that happens to have some dark fantasy stuff in it.\n\nI have absolutely no complaints in regards to its production value and technical accomplishments. The cinematography, costumes, set & creature design, the score (that lullaby breaks my heart every time), it's perfect.\n\nThat said, I can't imagine myself watching this again and again like I will with \"The Shape of Water\". That movie makes me feel hopeful, whereas this one takes my heart out and puts it in a blender.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make myself a nice cup of hot chocolate, wrap myself in a cozy blanket, and watch Paddington for the 15th time.",

All of these would have been enough for a fairy tale but this is Guillermo's show all over the screen where color, background score and even tiny creatures floating around or background the screen factors in for this majestic art that it is. El Laberinto Del Fauno is exhilarating, to-the-point, well detailed and dramatic which isn't surprisingly for the kids; considering its premise, but for the adults as it is equally terrifying and beautiful in its own way and with the help of the maker it walks a fine line between it.",

Sergi Lopez is excellent, convincingly portraying Vidal's cruel and sadistic nature and Maribel Verdu gives a strong and emotional performance as Mercedes, the house keeper and rebel informer. \nThe plot is extremely absorbing and you will find yourself getting very invested in the characters who are very well fleshed out and developed throughout the story. The action and violence in the film are also extremely brutal and bloody, relying on practical effects that accentuate the horror and peril that the protagonists are in.\nThe fantastical elements and dramatic scenes mix incredibly well in this film and the beautiful musical score really heightens the dark and often sad tone of the story. This film is beautifully shot, the cinematography and lighting is also excellent but the most visually impressive thing are perhaps the creatures. With a mixture of makeup, prosthetics and CGI, the creatures are brought to life in a haunting and almost frightening way, two of which are well performed by Doug Jones.\nI adore this film.

It makes sense that a sensitive girl who loves reading fairy tales, when confronted with a stepfather who is a sadistic captain in Francisco Franco's vindictive regime, would retreat into fantasy world, where she is a long-lost princess. But surely this is just a flight of her prepubescent imagination? Should she not submit to reality, and learn that she is only a female body made to carry the children of cruel men, like  Ofelia's beautiful but sad mother? All the choices are hard in this film, where the consequences of any action are often dramatic, and this includes our own choices as audience. Should we, with Ofelia, trust the faun?  He certainly is not very reassuring, and the girl will be tested. Whether taken as an allegory of Franco's regime, or as a dark fantasy of escape and liberation, the film is emotionally engaging.  Its power rests on the way rhythm, symbol and music work together to create the paths and parallels between  the two stories, the resistance to a tyrannical, macho and sadistic militarism, on the one hand, and the initiation rituals through fantasy, on the other. Do not expect careful, rigorous and sensitive historical reconstruction, though: here the story is one of good versus evil, in stark Black and White.",

When life is grown and born in a world in which we are conceived we are welcomed from one world into the next, as soon as we open our eyes. When we don't know what world will open up for us, to open a book that holds possibility in where to go. When our eyes are open to see a world full of wonder and various creatures we open to the thought of what other world's hold for us. When others are not wanted in some world's they hide, and are closed off sharing only their small world with those whom they are with.

When we don't open our mind to other world's existing we allow any door to be open for anything to come in. When we all have this one world we wish to be in, full of the people we want in, and people whom adores us see us more then something small that we rather be in. When having a family or someone to love is having a world worth living in, and opening up to the possibilities of sharing our life with forever, we never close them off to introduce others in in which we don't know or see. When we live in one world worth exploring we make sure we see all there is to see to open our heart, mind and eyes to various possibilities that forever keeps us in this world.

Then my cell phone blew up with repeated calls and messages as the climax was approaching. Out of courtesy I exited the theater to check my messages. Because of a work emergency I never walked back into that theater to see the end. As sad as it is to admit, later that day I actually went on a spoilers website to read how the movie ended. \n\nSeeing it again in its entirety I was quickly reminded how much I like this blend of real-world drama and fantastical story-telling. Whether the fairy tale was real or all a figment of Ofelia's imagination actually doesn't matter in the long run because the movie works either way. If you like a gritty, dark, sad ending you could say it's fake. If you like a hopeful, happy ending you simply take it as the truth. I lean towards it all actually happening, because without that reality there are a few things that don't make sense for me. \n\nThe drama that is unfolding around Ofelia is great. The Captain is a perfect villain. He is intimidating and ruthless, but we see just enough of him in quieter moments that you can sense why he is this way. The tension is high for all the people around him, which makes it surprising when we see that multiple people in his employ are working against him. I thought the cast was really good, even though I always have trouble telling if line delivery is done well when it's in a foreign language.\n\nThe real magic of Pan's Labyrinth is in the amazing costume and makeup work. The fact that they have multiple elaborate fantasy creatures that are done entirely with practical effects is remarkable. The authenticity is through the roof, and the handful of CGI effects are small and therefore your mind just accepts them as real because of all the other real stuff you are seeing. It's a marvelous looking film and I wish more modern day movies would learn how powerful it can be when you take the time and create practical effects.\n\nThere are a few things that don't work for me in the film. I struggle whenever an adult interacts with something out of Ofelia's story, it starts to raise so many questions for me. I thought there were some times when the movie lingered on something much longer than necessary, the most difficult being the sewing of the Captain's lip. There are a few other minor things that annoy me, but I can't say there are any major flaws in the film. It's one that I find very impressive, and if it were in English I might be tempted to add it to my collection.",

While there, Ofelia discovers a secret: she is the long lost princess of a mystical underground world, and in order to take her place in the throne, she must complete 3 tasks before the moon is full. To be honest, this movie has what I call the Mary Poppins syndrome, where you can look at the film 2 ways; a little girl trying to claim her right to rule a wonderland of sorts, OR a little using her imagination in a desperate attempt to escape the true horror of her situation. Her mother is sick, bleeding from the womb, her father is a ruthless, grotesque prideful monster, killing people without a second's hesitation, SPOILERS- including his own daughter at the end, praying for his child to be a boy, but not caring if his wife dies in the end, and torturing enemies in a degrading fashion. You know this girl is in Hell, so to speak, and at a young age, she might be imagining this stuff, but like I said, the true beauty of this film is the dramatic duality of our perspective, and the power that we are left with to decide if it was real or not, but there is equal reason throughout the film to support BOTH theories. Now, onto the technicalities. Aside from a specific visual transition that I found gimmicky at times, this movie demonstrated stellar camerawork, centered around tracking shots, whether it be to boats impressive visuals, very subtle suspense, or the duration of one of the actor's incredible performances, along with a diverse color palette, and VERY outstanding FX effects work, this is one of del Toro's finest movie technically. Aside from the said visual gimmick that got annoying, along with a VERY out-of-character decision for an excuse to make a suspenseful sequence, which leads to a very convenient plot point, this is a near perfect fantasy film. I give Pan's Labyrinth a 9/10",

            "content": "As adults, we have the notion that fairy tales are a representation of a childlike wonder that fascinates a youthful mind. Even when adults become parents themselves, and tell these stories to their own children, there is nostalgia and remembrance of times gone by. But what happens when reality gets in the way that makes fairy tales loose a sort of dream-like quality to them? Reality and the world of fiction cam blend together perfectly; it's just has to be done right. And there is no better example of this fine concept than in 2006's \"Pan's Labyrinth\", a wonderful movie that blends reality and fairy tales very well. Though that may be the film's downfall, it's still a good fairy tale, nonetheless. \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is a fantastic movie from the countries of Spain and Mexico that brings forth the dark side of fairy tales.\n\nSet in 1944 rural Spain, during the last leg of WWII, a young girl named Ofelia and her mother are moved to the forests under a fascist and cruel captain. While she is there, Ofelia finds a labyrinth, that, if one goes deeper, is full of ancient and mysterious relics. There is even a faun and a couple of faeries that fascinate her, too. Ofelia soon learns that she is a lost princess, and must complete three tasks in order to make her return to her kingdom. Can Ofelia complete the tasks and live in the fantasy realm, or will the real world be her downfall?\n\n\"Pan's Labyrinth\" is a fantastical movie that brings an otherwise foreign view on the concept of fairy tales Quite literally, as the movie was filmed in Mexico, and uses Spanish as its native language. And by using Spanish to tell the story, we are shown the eyes of storytelling from a different country. This is all thanks to writer, producer, and director Guillermo del Toro, who, prior to this film, was working on comic book movies like \"Hellboy\". What he brings to the production is something that combines a strong story with dark fantasy visuals against a realistic background. And with this production, we have amazing Mexican actors and actresses delivering outstanding performances, and a few American actors like Doug Jones playing the titular faun and the scary looking Pale Man. Plus the costumes fit the time period very well, and the make-up and practical effects on Doug Jones looks remarkable, and should be studied for further inspection on how to do monster makeup.\n\nThe editing keeps the pacing of the movie running smoothly at two hours, making the viewer appreciate what's going on. Musically, there is a main theme that plays out in the form of a lullaby, giving the orchestration a haunting tone, and perfect atmosphere to go along with the movie. And of course, the visuals look absolutely amazing. From the sets to the violence presented in the film, this movie is eye candy at its finest.\n\nThere is a major nitpick with the film and that can be a distraction to some viewers. While the fantasy world is nice, we do not spend a whole amount of time devoted to it. Instead, the main focus on the reality of the world, and that can be an interference with the main focus of what's going on. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is a magnificent fantasy that brings out a bit of realism to the stories of fairy tales.",

            "content": "So this has 95%...  How?  There're so many problems with it, but I guess it scrapes by and is still a decent movie.\n\nThe acting is good, the characters are good, and the visuals are also very good.  How then, does this only get three stars?  The plot/story is incredibly poor.  Don't get me wrong, I love the basic fairy-tale-esque introduction, and then the trials this little girl has to go through, but the movie just... never spends enough time on those parts.  The sinister faun is cool and all, but really the parts where fantasy takes hold are the most intriguing.  If only those scenes, especially the dining hall with that creepy monster thing, were played out more it could have been a masterful horror movie, but really this is not horror, just a thin, dark fantasy.  Key word here: thin.  If you manage to watch this without ever thinking, you will like it a lot.  If you're like me and think about what the hell is happening, then the thin veil falls away and you realize that this movie just doesn't logically make sense.  I'm not talking about the fantastical parts, I'm talking about the plot-based parts.  Let me explain each part, that I remember, individually, and in no order.\n\nThe second trial scene where the girl is given chalk to draw a door to the banquet hall.  This is by far the best scene in the whole movie.  And yet it has stupid mistakes.  The character Ofelia's task:  She must set an hourglass and do this task before the last grains of sand fall, without eating any of the food on the table, and use the fairies to guide her.  She is told it is paramount she shouldn't eat the food by the faun and the weird book thing.  When she starts the task, she spends such a long time walking slowly down the hall to the dining table with the monster.  I don't know what gave her the idea she should be walking as slow as she can, but whatever.  She opens her little fairy container thing and lets the fairies guide her to the three keyholes, and they point for her to use her key on the middle one.  She begins to try it but then says \"No,\" and uses the key on the leftmost keyhole.  So, all in all the fairies were totally pointless.  Cool.  Out of the keyhole she takes a knife, and then proceeds to leave but then stops and looks at a couple of grapes on the table.  Of course, it's obvious it would be a waste to let this monster stay there without having its time to shine, so Ofelia does the stupidest thing she can for the plot: she eats a grape, despite being told not to by everything she trusted.  What's even more stupid, she continues to eat more grapes without hearing the monster shambling towards her, nor its groans.  I can't say for sure what her thought process was, but the plot demanded the monster to be used in some way, and given the rules this was the only way.  To me, it's a simple fix to make your plot not force your characters to act so dumb.  Just change the rules so that the monster is something she actually has to actively avoid.  Make the trial harder, really, when you think about it it is so stupidly simple that I have no idea why it is considered dangerous.  So yeah, the monster kills some of her fairy friends, good going Ofelia, and then Ofelia runs back to the door but she's ran out of time, I wonder what could have saved her some, so she has to use her chalk to draw another door for her to escape.  She makes it back to her 'real' world bedroom, but the faun is pissed that she failed the task (by eating something), and I don't really blame it.  This is another WTF inconsistency because the faun comes back later, WITH the knife she got (she never gave him the knife) and is like, \"Actually, you can still do the last task,\" leaving me thinking \"WTF.\"  Everyone already knows she is the lost princess of the king in the underworld or wherever, so why did the faun even say she wasn't the one?  This ties back with what I'm saying, dumb plot = dumb character moments.\n\nThe first time Ofelia meets the faun is at the heart of the labyrinth, and he first tells her of tasks she must face to become princess again or whatever.  He says something along the lines of \"It will test you to make sure you are not mortal.\"  Uh, if she wasn't mortal, then why is she a little girl?  Also, instead of three convoluted tasks, why not just kill her to see if she is mortal?  Isn't that the most surefire way to show mortality?  Do you even know what mortal is?  Ugh, whatever, this could also have been explained better if the goddamn plot/rules were changed.\n\nThe last task where Ofelia brings her brother to the heart of the labyrinth while being chased by the crazy captain dude is probably by far the dumbest thing ever.  Ofelia poisons the captain's drink, and we see it take effect just moments after he drinks it, but he somehow manages to follow her AND keep up with her as she runs back to the labyrinth.  So, inconsistent poison is inconsistent.  Anyway, the faun tells Ofelia that just a prick of her brother's blood will let her go back to her kingdom and she's like \"No.\"  Uh, why is she backing out now?  I mean, it's not like the faun will kill her brother with the knife, it only said it required a prick and just a drop of blood.  You crawled through mud, large bugs, killed a giant toad and sifted through its innards for a key, risked life to acquire the dagger, and risked life again to bring the brother there and you're calling it off because of a drop of blood?  She even pricked her own finger for two drops of blood for that ruddy mandrake voodoo baby thing, what the hell is this girl's deal?  Oh, yeah, the plot.  So her refusal allows the captain enough time to snatch the brother out of her arms and shoot her dead.  The captain leaves with her brother, while Ofelia's own blood trickles down and... lets her into the underworld kingdom.  It turns out her final task was to die.  Or, as the faun puts it, willingly sacrifice herself instead of her brother.  I'm not entirely sure she was willing to get herself shot, and I'm not entirely sure a pinprick is considered just as worthy a sacrifice as getting shot, but whatever floats your boat.  In the end, all of the tasks didn't even matter, all she had to do was die, like I thought from the very beginning, so WTF.\n\nNo more of the fantasy, let's talk about the real world side of the plot.  Ofelia and her mother move to this place in the first place because the captain dude wants his son to be born in his outpost in the middle of a forest.  There's a doctor and a maid/servant (Mercedes) who are secretly helping the opposing army in the Spanish Civil War.  Later in the movie, Mercedes and the doctor sneak out and give aid to the other army.  Mercedes gives her BF (a soldier in the other army) a key (when she gave the supposed 'only key' to the captain) to the storeroom of the outpost, and then she and the doctor... they both go back to the outpost and continue pretending to be on their side.  So, I have no idea why they even go back, because it'll be obvious when the opposing army gets access to the storeroom and the captain was told he would have the only key by Mercedes.  He does later figure it out, surprise surprise, and the doctor is also found out because he stupidly lets the captain match a bottle of antibiotics that was found with the opposing army with his own.  Not very smart, but it progressed the plot.  Mercedes, after being caught, uses a concealed knife to escape and stab the captain several times and cut his mouth.  She then  flees and gets chased by several people on horseback, but she gets saved by the other army.  I don't know why she didn't kill the captain when she had the chance, oh wait, yeah I do, because the plot requires him to live.\n\nThe whole situation with the opposing army is straight up dumb.  They create a diversion by blowing up a train and getting the captain and some of his men to go out and see what was up, while in the meantime they stormed the outpost and raided the storeroom.  Somehow the opposing army managed to not overpower the men left to guard the outpost, and some of them didn't bother running away since they couldn't even take out the little men left there, no, they remained and had a round of shooting back and forth before they all died.  Well, except for one, who is then captured.  WTF!  They had one job, and they utterly failed, and managed to let one of their people get captured.  Truly, genius.\n\nSo, given they got massacred in that scene, how the hell did Pedro (Mercedes' BF soldier) come back with FIFTY-PLUS men to save her from getting killed?  If they had that many people, WHY THE HELL DID THEY NOT JUST TAKE OVER THE OUTPOST WHEN THEY FIRST RAIDED IT AND KILL ALL OPPOSITION!?  THEY COULD HAVE SAVED SO MANY LIVES, WTF WTF WTF?\n\nYeah, the plot really is so terrible that it brings the movie on the brink of getting 2 and a half stars.  Judging the whole movie on those several few, yet MAJOR plot points, though, wouldn't be fair, so I'm giving this 3/5.",

That's the special touch of Guillermo Del Toro.  Well, more like having a nightmare than dreaming, perhaps.  since it's  a dark fairy tale, just a little step from being a real horror movie (think to the Pale Man scene), but it's perfect this way: the main character is a little child, after all and this story makes the audience deeply concerned about her and her story and the ending is...well, just watch it and let Guillermo tell you this tale.",

It is one of the best films of fantasy of all time, the mixture of fantasy, horror, magic and suspense make \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is a triumph.

We can relate to and display immense sympathy for Ofelia's struggle, particularly during the period where she feels the lowest, which is impeccably executed. Due to the uneasy themes conveyed throughout the film, our protagonist lacks anyone that she can absolutely trust. Even the magical creature, whom she finds herself entrusted with performing delicate yet dangerous tasks for, is strikingly haunting.\n\nWhilst we watch Ofelia almost dauntlessly accept the challenge of completing the tasks and eagerly follow her journey to become a princess, several subplots begin to subtly develop. Vidal's wish to have a son, who will take over for him after his death, gave him some humane depth which made his character more believably evil yet even somehow extracting minor sympathy from the audience during certain scenes. The relationship between Mercedes and the rebels worked perfectly, linking with the backstory as well as tying into Ofelia's quest.\n\nPan's Labyrinth reminds us how important a solid plot really is when it comes to films like these, and it's safe to say the Guillermo Del Toro delivered a stroke of genius. This film remains one of my favorite, if not my absolute favorite film of all time.",

Ofelia's story is a dark tale of fantasy and horror populated with wild creatures of the imagination. An exquisite blend of terror and magnificence it's a true Beauty and the Beast story (along with bits of Alice in Wonderland and Cinderella), as Ofelia wanders her way through the ancient ruins that surround the encampment of her evil stepfather.\n\nThe violence and brutality of Franco's war regime is portrayed in bloody scenes of torture and murder which both contrast and compliment the world of fantasy that Ofelia creates.\nThis movie was nominated for six Oscars and won 3 and deservedly so as it's cinematography, design and execution is first rate.

            "content": "Considered to be one of Guillermo Del Toro's greatest films, Pan's Labyrinth sounded like an unmissable dark spectacle\n\nWith Pan's Labyrinth, it isn't as fantastical as I had thought. The narrative isn't perfect because while the fantasy themes and the real life story are both interesting of their own right, the way that the story darts back and forth between them is not always the most interesting. I felt like they were honestly two separate narratives, but that would partially because I don't know the historical context of post-Civil War Spain. But then again, this part of the narrative exists primarily as a means of supplying a simple backdrop for the fantasy tale. In actual fact, the film feels like a character oriented drama in a war torn and fantasy context which limits the scale of the story and makes it less conventional. Yet since I found myself isolated from the story context, the appeal came in through the dark fantasy elements and imagery for me. And in all honesty, I did not find that the quantity of imagery successfully lived up to my expectations. There is more time in Pan's Labyrinth spent showing the experiences of Ofelia with her mother and the story surrounding her stepfather Captain Vidal than anything else, and that made me feel like the film was misleading for its promotion as a dark fantasy film. Considering that there was genuinely so little use of fantasy and the story obsessed about its civil war drama, as well as some kind of supposed Roman Mythology. Incidentally, I feel that viewers need to be aware of a lot of history and mythology before actually going in to Pan's Labyrinth because without such awareness they are left with a stylish yet slow and even dull dark fantasy film which shows Guillermo Del Toro working hard to push the boundaries on what is expected of him. I admire his work as director and the stylish nature of the film, but the story itself just failed to grasp me because its underlying themes and concepts did not come across clearly to me, therefore leaving me confused and even bored at times.\nThe production values in Pan's Labyrinth are just exceptional. While Spanish or Mexican films tend to be rather repetitive in style for what I have seen, Pan's Labyrinth goes to an all new level. With Guillermo Del Toro's Hollywood experience, he combines a suitable budget with an eye for imagery not unlike that of critically acclaimed French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet. That general style combines with the somewhat Hollywood nature of the visual style which feels somewhat familiar to that of recent fantasy films such as Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events or Alice in Wonderland with a more dark edge to it. That is where the beauty comes into play because Pan's Labyrinth captures the innocent appeal of a fantasy film but pushes the limits on conventions and drives the story into darker territory in the process. The film depicts all kinds of original creatures who all have their own appeal which is both creepy and captivating in a way which the audience cannot turn away from, built upon a spectacle of detailed visual effects. The world around them is extremely convincing with the scenery being consistently rich with the appropriate colour and the production design and costumes all being so extensively detailed. The cinematography is also excellent because many of the shots are extensive and highlight the natural beauty of the production values in the film, as well as the genuine way that the film makes use of all of them with blood and gore, not afraid to embrace the dark nature of the tale with realistic violence. The stylish nature of Pan's Labyrinth is ultimately what makes it so memorable and worth the viewing because for a film with such a low budget, it is remarkable that Pan's Labyrinth is such an impressive visual experience. The imagery ultimately is just unforgettable because it is plain shocking at times, and I mean that in the remarkable sense of the word. The quality of the visuals in Pan's Labyrinth are unforgettable, and they combine with the musical score to make the film a dark and grim spectacle of atmosphere even when the story fails to match the quality of it.\nThe thing that compensates for the story in reaching out to audiences is the performances of a powerful cast.\nIvana Banquero delivers a powerful breakthrough performance in Pan's Labyrinth. Making a compelling character with her childish innocence, Ivana Banquero transcends expectations for the leading child in a fantasy story due to her ability to work through the dark themes of the film. Everything about Pan's Labyrinth is so dark, and she fearlessly steps up to all of it which has her interacting with the adult cast members with a supreme sense of professionalism about her. But more impressively, she works with the universe around her with a true sense of wonder, particularly with the CGI creatures. Ivana Banquero grips her character with a sense of ambitious wonder and genuine dramatic tension which shows her working with the legitimate drama and fantasy themes of the story. \nSergi Lopez also delivers a powerful effort, bringing the grim nature of the real world drama into perspective with dramatic competence and a fearlessness to really go for the edgy nature of the material. Ariadna Gil has some powerful moments when she shares a tense mother-daughter chemistry with Ivana Banquelo which feels very legitimate, and the physical acting of Doug Jones prove powerful beneath the captivating visual effects of Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nSo Pan's Labyrinth is a film which gets so caught up attempting to be a legitimate drama about the horrors of reality that it moves along at a slow pace without always dazzling viewers with its production values, but with powerful directorial work from Guillermo Del Toro, the wonderful style of the film fills Pan's Labyrinth with exceptional imagery and a powerfully dark atmosphere.",

The character of the Captain is terrifying, and Ofelia is marvelously played and terribly sympathizing. Balancing complex themes, and wisely spending most of its time in the real world setting of Spain in an under-explored slice of history, del Toro really goes for the jugular on this one, literally and metaphorically. The brutal edge of this film could have been toned back some (del Toro does a good enough job of building dread that he could afford to pull back occasionally) but the story is surprisingly affecting. A fascinating exploration of a child's imaginative perspective interacting with the horrible evil of the real world.",

The acting is actually very enchanting and intricately dark. This film haunted me the first time I saw it, and I probably wasn't even a teenager. It just blew my mind. The production is superb and the direction is both confident and unpredictable. It's quite an exquisite film. Every time I watch it, I get chills running down my backbone and excitement creeping through my eyes. This film is seething with so much brutality that it makes even the Excorcist look tame.

            "content": "Guillermo del Toro's wild fascination with practical creatures, locations and effects is often more impressive than the often acclaimed tendencies of auteur director Christopher Nolan, a man famed for his attempts to make the unrealistic possible. Del Toro understands that a magnificent and rich visual palette can very much accent the story and characters of a film, and that the technical wizardry behind cinema is often more important the screenwriter who pens the picture. Pan's Labyrinth is perhaps Del Toro's finest folio of work in regards to his aesthetic competence, his ability to be able to accent dialogue, action and brutality with movement, colour, framing and practical effects absolutely applaudable.\n\nThough that's not to discount the capacity of Del Toro's writing ability, his ability to be able to bring to a life a story that encapsulates a combination of wonder and intrigue with pain and hardship never so utterly palpable as it is here. Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of a young girl, Ofelia, who escapes the horrors and misery of her literal life by fleeing to the depths of her imagination, and bringing into existence stories of fanciful creatures and magical lands. When she is brought by her pregnant mother to a military outpost manned by her new, sadistic stepfather, she becomes convinced that she is a long lost princess, lost to her underground homeland after she walked into the sunlight of the surface and was relieved of her memories. She is brought into a labyrinth that presides close to the outpost by a fairy, who helps her uncover a Faun who seeks to bring her back into her rightful kingdom. All this transpires whilst Ofelia's stepfather is attempting to quell a rebellion provoked by republicans who detest the current Francisco Franco regime and wish for it change.\n\nDel Toro weaves the two interconnecting stories of war and fantasy together with immense precision and delicacy. He seeks to provide both components of the story their moments in the sun, and when the war and fanciful elements combine, truly spectacular moments materialize. The fairy tale-like pacing, characters and plot, which feature relatively simplistic constructs that are surrounded by more intricate details, feels old-timely, and so fans of old-school cinema should appreciate the workmanship on offer here. Perhaps the only detractor from the film as a whole is its imbalance in terms of how much of the mythological portion of the picture is shown; whilst one who has seen the trailer and theatrical posters would be willing to contend that the film seems to feature more of the fairy tale story than the one that occurs in the modern reality, you would in fact be incorrect. This is a minor but key drawback, as these fanciful sequences are absolutely the most engaging segments of the picture, and their slim quantity, whilst leaving us desiring more (which is better than oversaturation), proves frustrating and partially disappointing. That said, the fantasy sequences are by far the most memorable and where Del Toro's plethora of knowledge and skill come to the forefront.\n\nThis isn't to discount the story that is occurring in the reality of Ofelia's situation. Her stepfather, the military Captain Vidal, is without concern for his new daughter, and abuses her both physically and mentally without restraint at certain points. Unlike Ofelia's mother, the kind hearted and passionate Carmen, he is not afraid to display his shame for his stepdaughter for all to see. And whilst he is not entirely morally ambiguous, his lack of sensitivity, sympathy or empathy proves alienating for both our protagonist and ourselves. He is the perfect antagonist; someone of reasonable intellect, but with dastardly intentions and lacking in warmth. The largest subplot of the film features his search for the rebels of Spain who are against the current government, but the specifics of this story are never fully realised or placed in the forefront. Continuing on in the classic fairy tale fashion, Del Toro disregards such trivial details and instead focuses on something far more emotionally poignant; stories of survival and love, betrayal and deception. The handmaiden for Ofelia and her mother, Mercedes, is working with the rebels, and she possesses an infatuation with one of the soldiers who she is meant to be against. She works alongside Ferreiro, a doctor who works as an informant but nevertheless provides aid to Carmen as she enters the late stages of her pregnancy. Their plight is nearly as compelling as Ofelia's journey into the depths of her wild creativity.\n\nDel Toro has never been seen as this lavish and complex, his story somehow managing to entwine two different, contrasting stories with ease. He brings the flourishing nature of the fairy tale sequences into the war conflicts, which feature large and bountiful sets representing the muddled mental state many of the main and supporting characters contain. Captain Vidal is the perfect example of this, his room being comprised of bold circular establishments that feel thrown together in an assortment of forms that prove cluttered and messy. His deteriorating mental state is reflected by this shambled set, meticulously constructed with attention to detail that allows close examination. Del Toro's ability to be able to extract information about any individual, their personality and their stance through visual story telling, whether it be through the gorgeous cinematography (which rightfully won an Academy Award), the set design, the lighting, the costume design or the magnificent make-up (which also was awarded top honours at the aforementioned ceremony), is utterly worthy of praise. Whereas so many directors limit their visual appeal and revert to basic and unimaginative dialogue sequences to indulge the audience in information, Del Toro understands that to quicken his pace and maintain the attention of the audience he needs to take full advantage of the format which he is constructing for; this isn't a book which is conceived with words. This is a work of moving images and sound, and Del Toro uses both those contexts to their fullest being.\n\nDel Toro's cinematography in particular deserves great admiration, and whilst I briefly touched upon its brilliance, it deserves a more detailed examination. Guillermo Navarro's work in all of his collaborations with Del Toro has been viewed as spectacular, from their original pairing for Cronos to 2013's exceptionally good-looking Pacific Rim, but none can best Pan's Labyrinth in sheer passion and beauty. The way Navarro moves his cameras is spectacular, and he always seeks invigorating and challenging ways to engage the audience in less striking sequences (the way he frames two characters together and has them move and waver whilst in discussion is particularly fantastic). Navarro and Del Toro are also huge fans of the \"reveal\" shot; this is where the camera is circling a character from one angle to eventually, for a sudden and shocking effect, reveal a character or group of characters that either pop into frame or appear at another angle that may be considered a threat. This shot is most prominent in the fantasy sequences and they are entrancing, beautiful pieces of cinematography, namely this one at 0:44 minutes in, which pans to reveal a creature which we are initially unsure of and consider a potential danger to our protagonist. It's visually pleasing to see a director who wants his camera to be involved with the characters, their revelations, discoveries and shocks. The men never complicate their frames too much to the extent of, say, a Michael Bay picture, which contains so many moving and contrasting points of depth that the frame is immensely difficult to comprehend, but they still manage to possess an extensive preoccupation with size, movement and visual storytelling. For fans of lush and gorgeous cinematography and blocking, there are few films which are as admirable as Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nThe texture of the film, accented with often dark and muddy lighting (as well as my favourite feature of cinema: rain!) provides yet more personality and darkness to this confounding tale of innocence lost. These are juxtaposed with gorgeous and intimate golds as well as relaxing purples and dark blues. The former can be seen here, and the latter within the formerly mentioned clip a paragraph upwards. David Lee and Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez, the two gaffers responsible for the lighting design are very much worthy of commendation, their work on this film utterly fantastic; even preferable to Lee's work within Hellboy II, another quality Del Toro feature that benefits greatly from Lee's contributions. Also amiable is the score, composed by Javier Navarette, which doesn't necessarily contain that many individual stand out moments, but contains a multitude of thematic concepts which work together to form narrative constructs in the musical realm. Navarette utilizes deep gothic flavours, Spanish-themed instrumentation and light choral influences to compose a harrowing and beautiful score that works wonders both inside and outside of its intended context. An exceptionally powerful work (you can read more acclaim here).\n\nThere honestly isn't much to complain about. Ofelia's story is handled with sincerity but a childlike naivety that is slowly torn away as her ignorance and credulity is slowly washed away to reveal a tender and young soul. Del Toro presents a classic story with modern features and gorgeous, sweeping cinematography, to provide nearly two hours of absolute euphoria. It is faulted slightly in its balance between the two differentiating storylines, but this sole detractor isn't worth enough to render anything less than a near-perfect rating. Every second of Pan's Labyrinth is full of rich beauty, imagination, wild creativity and detail. This is an emotional, carefully constructed, but ultimately ingenious creation that renders a thoroughly heartbreaking experience that shan't be forgotten soon. A great way to heighten my anticipation for Del Toro's next picture, Crimson Peak. Highly recommended.",

Honestly, if I'd known what I was missing out on, I would have watched it a long time ago.\u00a0\n\nPan's Labyrinth begins with a strange, confronting scene as blood bactracks through a small girl's nose as she lies on the ground. We are then told of an ancient fairy tale, in which a princess escapes from her underground kingdom to the world above where he dies, leaving her spirit to return in a different form at a later time.\u00a0\n\nIn another story strand, we find Ofelia, the young girl who we saw bleeding at the beginning on her way to see her stepfather. It is towards the end of the Spanish civil war.\u00a0\n\nThese two scenarios, though polar opposites, somehow go side by side perfectly as we follow the dastardly gentleman Captain Vidal and his seemingly-delusional step-daughter.\u00a0\n\nAt first it seems that the film will be about the Captain and his effect on Ofelia. That's up until we meet the faun. The introduction of Pan takes the whole film to an entirely new level, combining an incredibly beautiful fantasy world with an almost as darkly beautiful soldier's camp. The art direction is amazing. Whether it's Pan's inverted knees and knotted shoulders or a gigantic toad or intensely gruesome moments of violence, it's incredible. The intense detail is astounding as well, especially in one outstanding sequence with an extremely disturbing creature known as the pale man. The table of food practically glistens while the walls are covered in beautifully vile images of his escapades.\u00a0\n\nThe script is great too. We experience just how wrapped up in her fantasies Ofelia is and just how cold Captain Vidal can be, as well as just how desparate Carmen is. The delivery by the actors is nothing short of brilliant, with standout performances by Sergi Lopez as Vidal and Doug Jones as Pan and the Pale Man. Jones' performance is especially powerful delivering scolding speeches with incredible power. Del Toro also coaxes an incredible performance from his diminutive lead, Ivana Baquero. She brings an authenticity to a role which could have easily been made into a caricature with the whole wide eyes and high voice routine. A lot of credit for that goes to the script which doesn't treat its child star like a child.\u00a0\n\nThe score is a beautiful, with the constant of a Spanish lullaby which helps to purport the difficulty in sorting the reality from fantasy.\u00a0\n\nDel Toro's work in this film is something to be praised, seeing as the Hellboy's weren't really anything to be in awe of. But he creates his own style in this film, with seamless transtitions from one shot to the next and beautifully choreographed camera movement.\u00a0\n\nPan's Labyrinth is a brilliant film with frightening intensity and a truly original take upon fantasy as well as bringing a feeling of danger in the face of the fantasy, much akin to Where the Wild Things Are. With a brilliant ending which causes a collision with fantasy and reality as well as causing a crazy headspin to the viewers, Pan's Labyrinth is definitely worth watching multiple times.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThree words. The Pale Man. You may need a change of underwear handy.",

You could compare it to Alice in Wonderland in terms of surreality, but in my opinion, this film is what Alice in Wonderland would be like if it were rooted in a deathly serious tone. The plot alternates between the alluring fantasy of the labyrinth, and the grim reality of Francoist Spain. Until the very end of the film, both worlds seem equally dark, and this film does very well to try and juggle the two worlds together. Aside from the beautifully dark visuals, the film's biggest strength, perhaps, is its ability to establish a sense of mood, and this makes it easy for the viewer to believe that the film is going a certain way. For example, the final scenes of the film had me believing that the film was a bitter ending (which I actually would have welcomed), so the relatively positive ending came as quite a surprise. The performances helped the film's overall mood significantly, and I find that it was very easy for me to engage with the characters, although I find that many of the real world characters were unlikable, which I think may have been intended by the writers to establish the real world as a truly horrible place. It presents a vision of fantasy wrapped in horror and drama, yet with a light at the end of the tunnel. It's a very intriguing and artistic adventure filled with real emotion, and that by itself more than worth watching.",

Amazing use of CGI and practical effect combined, amazing acting, especially from the lead actress, who might be the best child actor i've ever seen. Also, truly one of the greatest antagonists in any film iv'e ever seen. It takes tremendous acting skill to pull off what he did. I wont spoil anything. But to sum it up, something happens at around the 10-15 minute mark where you really start to realise what he is capable of. Basically In short, speak spanish? Great, you'll find this movie awesome.

They both flowed together seamlessly. \n\n\nSeveral films in the past have failed to do that task, Baz Lurhman is a guilty party in this case, but the filmmakers manage to make it work and for that I'm amazed.

This movie is imaginative and beautiful, but also realistic and dark. The way Guillermo del Toro mixes these two total opposites together is wonderful. Pans Labyrinth has superb acting from both the adult actors and the child actor (Ivana Baquero). Finding child actors who can actually act can be difficult for example Earth to Echo, (I havent seen it but) my god the acting in the trailer almost lowered my IQ. Anyway, the movie is intriguing, unique, and is a fairy tale for grown ups.\nPans Labyrinth includes groundbreaking visuals, a beautiful but also very dark story, great acting, a great script, but most of all Pan's Labyrinth lets us see the beauty in the world no matter how brutal or violent it can be. Pan's Labyrinth really is one of the best movies of the decade, and I will stand by that no matter what.",

The fantasy aspect that the previews and posters gives off in only half of the plot with the main focus being on a sadistic 1944 army officer. The characters are well written and they do quickly grow on you.\nWhilst there are some visual effects used, del Toro is well known for his use of practical creature effects. The character of Fauno and Pale Man look fantastic and credit must go to the designers and performer Doug Jones.\nThe story jumps into it and doesn't slow down at all.

The mother (Ariadna Gil) plans to wed the captain (Sergi Lopez), and is pregnant with his child, whom the captain strongly believes will be a son. From here is when the story splits. Ofelia loves fairy tales, and in this time of desire to escape from reality, she discovers the realm of magic and an opportunity for her to lead a new life as princess of the Underworld. Guiding her is the deliciously deceitful faun named Pan (Doug Jones), whose labyrinth holds the portal awaiting to be opened. Her side of the story is a fantastical, sometimes frightening, adventure. Her primary obstacle is reality. Is the adventure a dream or not? That's up to you. Meanwhile, in seemingly unrelated news, a republican rebel force has formed to take back the power that the nationalist army ripped from the rebels during the Spanish civil war (which I knew very little about, going into the movie). This war section isn't just some given circumstance. Roughly half of the movie pays attention to the battle between the two sides. My primary question, after the movie had ended, was, \"Why were these two stories told as one?\" It took some time to think about it. Eventually, I connected the fantasy and reality by observing that, at the beginning, both Ofelia and the rebels are in a place of despair. They can only cope with their surroundings and circumstances by ambitiously following a dream that seems impossible to realize in reality. Pan's Labyrinth ends in serenity, masked by bloody destruction. The more I think about the story as a whole, the more I love it.\n\nI refer to Pan's Labyrinth as a fairytale, and I also said that it is dark in all the right places. I'll bring to your attention that the film is R-rated, and it gets very messy in some places. A large, gluttonous frog once vomits out his whole body, while the captain once stabs a local's face to death with a baton. That's something to keep in mind. I'm not sure how I feel about the captain. Some may write him off as a stereotypically evil military buff. I felt the same way until his love for his child becomes a driving force. He's more in love with his legacy than the child itself, but the child nevertheless adds depth to the captain's character. Right on, Sergi Lopez. Ivana Baquero is a very competent child actress, unconcerned about acting like a child. Her courage and thrill for adventure far outshines her occasionally naive, childlike actions. And she never goes for the melodramatic, even in the most traumatic moments. My favourite actor is Doug Jones, who plays both Pan and the Pale Man, a child devourer with eyes on his hands. The physicality he gives to both characters gives me chills, perhaps too in debt to the choice cinematography and lighting. Scenes at night are only illuminated by the moon, and scenes indoors purposely have dull colouring. My guess is that director Del Toro did not want the film to look like a vivid Disney film. It's all so mystical, and I love it. I swam back and forth from reality to fantasy, and I would do it again.",

If the movie focused more on the fantasy story rather than the human story, it would've been so much better. Because in all honesty the human story and fantasy story DID NOT blend together very well. The message was pretty vague and blunted because of the poor blending. The film does have incredible visuals, acting, & production.

            "content": "Pan's Labyrinth, regarded by many as Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece and arguably regarded as one of the best films of the decade. I have seen this film twice and I never could grasp the power that everyone seems to receive from watching this film, but I am able to clutch on to a few things that this film does right.\n\nThe film is an original screenplay written by Guillermo del Toro, he mostly participates in the film's writing when he directs a film, and what he has crafted here is definitely something that is personal to him. Del Toro has written a story set in a time where the land of Spain was in a state of war within itself; the characters in this story, particularly the protagonist Ofelia, is searching for a land in order to gain peace and wipe away the horrors of reality. The film was able to establish the connection that Ofelia has with this magical world at the start, allowing us to believe and understand the connection she has with this fantasy. The tasks that Ofelia must go through seem to represent subtly a virtue that she must gain in order to become a better person, or for her sake a 'princess', which is important to have in a world that she currently lives in and the world she aspires to join in. Del Toro lets the audience follow two storylines, Ofelia's and the Spanish rebels, in a way they both connect but each one can be made into a film of it's own. The characters in this film are great to watch, with Ofelia being so driven in her goal to find her way back home and Vidal being so ruthless that my eyes widen whenever he has plans to inflict pain. The faun was interesting to see as he is a creature that is, to my knowledge, never been seen in cinema. The dialogue in this film, for the most part, works but there are a few times where it needed a little more substance but this is just a minor issue.\n\nThis film, is my starting point in del Toro's filmography. Pan's Labyrinth is a film that contains Fantasy elements that have been found on films like Alice In Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz but employs a much darker tone. Del Toro made this film to feel accessible to adults as he doesn't allow the story to be sugar coated in order to sell Ofelia's story. Del Toro has been known to incorporate horror in his films, and he does so here but not just for the sake of having it. The horror comes from the pain that these characters suffer and it allows the audience to feel their pain, regardless of who is the victim. It is supported by not holding back on the use of blood and violence, allowing the film to create a stronger effect on us. The film's pacing works, especially towards the climax, as he cuts back and forth to the war in reality and Ofelia's journey. My main issue with the film is that the film leans towards more on the reality side, with the fantasy aspect of it feeling underwhelming and unexplored. I wanted more from this magical world in order for me to care in Ofelia succeeding, it doesn't have to go to such lengths in dedicating a long scene for it to be explored but it could have been included in the dialogue between the faun and Ofelia.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Guillermo Navarro, who is a frequent collaborator with del Toro. The earliest film I have seen of Navarro's work is Jackie Brown, which was darker than Quentin Tarantino's previous films; that style in creating that dark atmosphere is found here. Navarro's photography is one of the main reasons why del Toro's film feels very mature. This allows us to take the film's story seriously and understand that this is more than just a children's fantasy film. Never throughout the film does it look natural. Navarro handles the film's night/dark scenes to look cold with a blue palette, while he exhibits the daytime sequences to feel very warm. The camera captures what it needs to establish the scene and support the ideas that del Toro wants the scenes to project. I hope this collaboration keeps on going in future films as both seem to have a great understanding of each other's intentions. \n\nThe film's score was handled by Javier Navarrete who has worked with del Toro previously on The Devil's Backbone and Cronos. His score here doesn't draw attention to itself, but rather subtly emerges in order to sell a scene or to avoid the scene from feeling still. The only time when Navarrete's score stands out is when it uses the lullaby in the film, as it stays with you throughout and even when it ends. The score didn't sound too melodramatic or did it feel too cliche'd but it definitely didn't show that it was a force to be reckon with.\n\nIvana Baquero plays the film's protagonist. She played the part well but it never got to a point where I was amazed or inspired by her work, Baquero just performed what was required in order to come off as tolerable. Sergi Lopez on the other hand was a standout, maybe it also is due to how well written his role is. Lopez succeeds to come off as ruthless and threatening without having to be so obvious to us on how 'evil' this guy really is. Which is the reason why his moments of violence comes off as a shock rather than just something that is expected. Maribel Verdu did her part well as Mercedes. She was able to play off as an 'inside man' character while also be a caring older sister for Ofelia. Doug Jones as Pan (Faun) was a delight to watch as he was able to project himself as someone who is bizarre but also frightening.\n\nMy opinion of Pan's Labyrinth may be in the minority but I cannot say that this film is not worth a watch as it has the ability to create a bridge between reality and fantasy and coming off it satisfied with what Guillermo del Toro has crafted for us.",

            "content": "Nobody ever seems to understand that the original fairytales (such as Sleeping Beauty and the Little Mermaid) were all very dark tales in the beginning, before Disney and the like changed them. This movie is like a classic (a real classic) fairytale. The designs, the story, the places, the people; everything reminds me of a classic fairytale! And it's all fantastic. I won't act like it's the most perfect movie ever (I am of the belief that nothing is ever perfect, but things can be so close that any flaws something has doesn't matter and are inconsequential overall), but this is extremely good, even with the slight flaws I did finally notice upon a second viewing. Nothing major or terrible enough to draw away from the film. I was hooked from the start, because I felt like a little kid again, but instead of going on a fluffy kid friendly adventure, I was instead going on an adult adventure. That doesn't happen very often. I'm not saying this movie is good for kids, but it's good for people who relished being treated as adults in film as a kid. For some reason it just struck me as something like that. And what's more, instead of other films that ram symbolism down the audiences collective throats, this one just didn't seem to do that. Yes it has symbolism, but even if you somehow took that away from it, it would still stand on its own. That is the art of good film making. And the acting; what else can I say that others already haven't? Doug Jones is just fantastic, top notch! With other actors, if they had to wear all that makeup and other things to look like Pan, they would just seem so wooden and stilted, or you would see the actor playing the creature, not the creature itself. But with Doug, I never got that sense. It was Pan on my screen. It was the Pale Man on my screen. No one else. Everyone else is wonderful in their own roles as well, it's just that Doug overshadowed them terribly with his performance. But that's okay, because they all still did a great job. I can't help but sympathize with Ophelia (what a pretty name by the way) since I grew up in a single parent household. When Ophelia and her mother are having that conversation about why her mother remarried, I saw me and my mother talking instead, because I had that same conversation with my mother so many times at that age. I couldn't understand what she meant about being alone, but now I do. So I could really appreciate the realism of that scene. It's been so long since I saw a movie capture my attention and imagination like this one did. In fact, it's been a while since I've actually felt grateful for being able to watch a movie. I don't think I've felt that way since the Avengers. And that's the best thing I can say for this film: it made me proud that there can still be good films made post-2000. If you listen to anybody else it doesn't seem that way, but this film is a good reminder that not every film that can be made has already been made yet. I'm glad I watched it and I will definitely watch it again sometime soon.",

The 20th century, too, was at times brutally and indiscriminately violent, thanks in no small part to the fascist regimes of 1930s and 1940s Europe. Guillermo del Toro sets these two legacies of violence side by side at a Franco-era Spanish military compound built atop a stone ruin and surrounded by woods. This is the killing ground of a fascist officer, but it is also the home (really the prison) of his stepdaughter Ofelia, a book-loving girl who sees monstrous creatures in the trees and walls. Ofelia's encounters with a faun, insectoid fairies, and a faceless, child-killing thing with blood-stained claws are the most creative and interesting parts of the movie. It is unfortunate that so much time is spent away from her and these CG creations and spent instead on her stepfather, who feels like a villain imported from a slasher horror. His persecution of a band of clich\u00e9d guerrillas is predictable, and more gruesome than seems necessary for a fantasy period piece. At last, though, del Toro provides an ending that feels true to both the fairytale world and the real one, without compromising the dark tone he sets for both.",

            "content": "Pan's Labyrinth is one of those films that starts so well that you hope it will stay that good but which actually surprises you and constantly improves. It's a remarkably layered work about the importance of choice even in an emotional and political dictatorship and about the fictions and fantasies that sustain people through the worst circumstances. On the surface this appears to be little more than a more fantastic spin on The Spirit of the Beehive, sharing its post-Spanish Civil War setting as well as the broken family setting, but this is a far superior film in every way. Although marketed largely as a fantasy, its real power lies in the scenes set in the real world where Sergi Lopez's all too believable Fascist monster is mopping up the few remaining communist guerrillas in the hills while waiting for his sick wife to give birth to his son while her daughter from her first marriage tries to reassert her own identity rather than submit to the Captain's idea of family.\n\nThe challenges of the mythical world are far less disturbing - or violent - than the real one, and it's all too easy to see why she wants to escape into the darkness of the labyrinth where at least the hope of something better exists. But then she's not the only one escaping into the imagination, as her mother sustains herself with a romanticised view of her meeting the captain that he has no interest in whatsoever. To him stories - even a part of his family history that has passed into local legend - exist only to be denied. Lopez's greatest sin isn't the pride that he admits to, or even that he is so pitiless, it's that he chooses to obey without question: the girl's small triumph is that she does not. And the triumphs in the film are generally small, quiet ones, where courage and fear go hand in hand, making the few acts of decency all the more important when they occur. There is one \"saved by the cavalry\" moment that at first doesn't convince but does prove to be there for a definite purpose that makes the ending all the more powerful.\n\nBut while there's a lot going on underneath the surface of the film, it doesn't crush it with the weight of its ideas. It's directed with a visual assurance and, at times, playfulness that sweeps you along, sometimes with delight, sometimes with apprehension, but never simply for the sake of a nice shot or a neat special effect (most of which are incredibly well integrated for such a low budget feature). The performances are superb, with Lopez somehow managing to avoid turning his irredeemable character into a caricature: this is an evil without conscience that is all too recognisable. Javier Navarette's beautiful score is also adept at walking the fine line between magic and emotion without crossing the line into schmaltz.\n\nIt's a remarkable film, that I'd genuinely say is one of the greatest of all time. It's been years since I was so affected by I movie that I had to see the very next show. Practically perfect and definitely one of the most visually pleasing and stunningly well told films of the 21st Century. A+",

            "content": "Most critics say Pan's Labyrinth is a wondrous fairy tale, a beautifully crafted film with a awe inspiring story and amazing fantasy elements that will surely be some of the best ever seen. Other critics say it was amazing, a movie like no other with a surefire way to win your emotions and love for this film. Some critics say it is the best film of the decade, others of all time. I think I saw the wrong Pan's Labyrinth. Guillermo del Toro's \"classic\" film is not what I thought it would be. In my opinion, it is not a fairy tale, but a drama film with fairy tale elements. We barely get much fantasy in this movie anyway, as we are stuck in the world of mortals most of the films, and we don't experience much fantasy feel within the film. But when there is fantasy, fairy tale like moments in the film, it is done right. It is done amazingly. The entire movie, you see a little more fantasy, and what you do see you beg for more of it. The puppetry in this movie is fantastic, and so is the CGI. The faun in this movie looks so good I just wanted to see more of him. We also see bugs that turn into fairies, and a hand-eyes monster that creeps down your spine. It's a strange film, but one that will amaze you with it's puppetry and CGI. But we just don't get enough of that amazement. Sure, it gives us a decent story to put that fairy tale back drop on, but that story is in no way as compelling as the characters themselves. We just need more of the \"fairy\" aspect of this fairy tale, not more of the mortal, human world story. Strangely, Guillermo del Toro pulls the same kind of trick in Pacific Rim. We get plenty of human characters and their lives, but we wanted more of the robot vs. monster fighting. But that's for another review. It just makes me wonder whether del Toro teases us by giving us only small amounts of fantastical film, such as the monsters and creatures in Pan's Labrynth, so we stay in our seats to watch more and more and wait out the film to see if we do get more of that fantastical feel. But its del Toro's way of directing a film, and if he likes to tease an audience, so be it. We just need some of that teasing to actually turn into full on flirting.\r\n\r\n   Pan's Labyrinth, by the way, is a 2006 fantasy drama Spanish film starring Ivana Baquero, Ariadna Gil, Sergi Lopez, and Doug Jones. Ivana Baquero plays Ofelia, a girl who's mother (Ariadna Gil) has married a an army captain (Sergi Lopez) and moves into the mountains with her daughter to give birth to her son while her husband works there. At the same time, guerrilla armies are camping up in these mountains, ready to kill any Spanish soldiers they can. A labyrinth lies near the cottage Ofelia and her mother are staying in, and Ofelia goes inside to discover a world she would've never thought to find. The guerrilla warfare really annoyed me in this movie. I thought the whole plot, to be honest, was cliche and generic. I'm not sure whether del Toro was going for the familiar \"fairy tale\" feel, but all I felt was the this-feels-like-its-already-been-done one. The guerrilla fighters were unnecessary to the plot, and it was just added in to create danger. We didn't know why they were fighting, all we knew was that their side lost the war and that they are the last of these soldiers. There was a nostalgic vibe coming from this film, taking you back to the days when you were listening to these kinds of stories in your bed before you fell asleep. Sadly, though, the rest of the film just felt very generic. The acting was solid in this movie, nothing really special coming from any of them. But the one exception was Doug Jones, the man who played the faun and the pale man (you will understand who he is when you watch the film). He totally takes this movie, engrossing himself into these characters and fully acting out. The faun was creepy when you first saw him, but he slowly turned out to be a wondrous sight, something I looked forward to watching, something I trusted and adored. The pale man was also very creepy and the way Doug Jones portrayed him was excellent and horrifying to see. Doug Jones is a great creature actor, high up there with ranks of those such as Andy Serkis and Jim Carrey.\r\n\r\n   All in all, I did like Pan's Labyrinth. Sure, it wasn't the fantastical extravaganza I expected, but I liked that; it was something I didn't expect. Guillermo del Toro directs an excellent fairy tale for adults, one with horrors and violence, language gore, but still keeps that nostalgic, full \"bedtime story\" kind of feel to it. Pan's Labyrinth has grown on me since I've been writing this film, but I still wished it had more fantastical scenes rather than building on human development type scenes. Pan's Labyrinth is a one of kind film, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have that generic feel to it. In the end, I enjoyed Pan's Labyrinth, but wished I could've enjoyed it more, wish it could've changed a bit. But in all truth and honesty, which fairy tales really do change? If they did, there would be no point in them. 7/10.",

So he decided to fix that by showing me the film and now here's my review for Pan's Labyrinth.\n\nPlot: Set in post- Civil War in Spain, Ofelia is a young girl who travels with her pregnant mother to meet her stepfather, Captain Vidal. During her stay she comes across a fairy who takes her deep into the labyrinth where she meets a fawn. He tells her that he believes that she is actually Princess Moanna of the underworld, who lost her memory due to going to the human world out of curiosity and eventually died. The father of the princess believes that her spirit would return, and so believing that Ofelia is Moanna, send her to these three quests before the full moon so that her essence may stay intact.\n\nThis was an excellent movie to finally see after hearing so much about it. It has a very sad, and dark story that has all these kinds of symbolism/similarities to other fairy tales and fantasy stories like Red Riding Hood and Alice in Wonderland. But what makes it really unique is how they put all the similarities together to make this story that is different. There are some things that you think will happen, but they might do something else entirely which makes it more original. The actors gave terrific performances, the most memorable would be Ivana Baquero, Sergi L\u00f3pez and Doug Jones as Ofelia, Captain Vidal and The Fawn. And this movie is also known for having great cinematography, make up and art direction. And why not? All three of them are great. This film has great shots, the design is very creative, and I just really like how much work they really put into the makeup above everything else. Blaine showed me the special features for this film and that just impressed me all the more with why they deserved the Oscar for that particular category. They did an awful lot to bring a character to life or make a certain cut or wound look very real. And the process that they went through for creating the Fawn and the Pale Man and make them look very creative and unique to creating those certain types of creatures.\n\nAnd that's my review for Pan's Labyrinth. It's a great movie with a very well written story, excellent acting, and as it's more commonly known, shows a great sense of art with its cinematography, art design and makeup. It's a very enjoyable film despite how particularly sad and dark it can be, but if you haven't seen this movie before, you should check it out.",

            "content": "Pan's Labyrinth, regarded by many as Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece and arguably regarded as one of the best films of the decade. I have seen this film twice and I never could grasp the power that everyone seems to receive from watching this film, but I am able to clutch on to a few things that this film does right.\n\nThe film is an original screenplay written by Guillermo del Toro, he mostly participates in the film's writing when he directs a film, and what he has crafted here is definitely something that is personal to him. Del Toro has written a story set in a time where the land of Spain was in a state of war within itself; the characters in this story, particularly the protagonist Ofelia, is searching for a land in order to gain peace and wipe away the horrors of reality. The film was able to establish the connection that Ofelia has with this magical world at the start, allowing us to believe and understand the connection she has with this fantasy. The tasks that Ofelia must go through seem to represent subtly a virtue that she must gain in order to become a better person, or for her sake a 'princess', which is important to have in a world that she currently lives in and the world she aspires to join in. Del Toro lets the audience follow two storylines, Ofelia's and the Spanish rebels, in a way they both connect but each one can be made into a film of it's own. The characters in this film are great to watch, with Ofelia being so driven in her goal to find her way back home and Vidal being so ruthless that my eyes widen whenever he has plans to inflict pain. The faun was interesting to see as he is a creature that is, to my knowledge, never been seen in cinema. The dialogue in this film, for the most part, works but there are a few times where it needed a little more substance but this is just a minor issue.\n\nThis film, is my starting point in del Toro's filmography. Pan's Labyrinth is a film that contains Fantasy elements that have been found on films like Alice In Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz but employs a much darker tone. Del Toro made this film to feel accessible to adults as he doesn't allow the story to be sugar coated in order to sell Ofelia's story. Del Toro has been known to incorporate horror in his films, and he does so here but not just for the sake of having it. The horror comes from the pain that these characters suffer and it allows the audience to feel their pain, regardless of who is the victim. It is supported by not holding back on the use of blood and violence, allowing the film to create a stronger effect on us. The film's pacing works, especially towards the climax, as he cuts back and forth to the war in reality and Ofelia's journey. My main issue with the film is that the film leans towards more on the reality side, with the fantasy aspect of it feeling underwhelming and unexplored. I wanted more from this magical world in order for me to care in Ofelia succeeding, it doesn't have to go to such lengths in dedicating a long scene for it to be explored but it could have been included in the dialogue between the faun and Ofelia.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Guillermo Navarro, who is a frequent collaborator with del Toro. The earliest film I have seen of Navarro's work is Jackie Brown, which was darker than Quentin Tarantino's previous films; that style in creating that dark atmosphere is found here. Navarro's photography is one of the main reasons why del Toro's film feels very mature. This allows us to take the film's story seriously and understand that this is more than just a children's fantasy film. Never throughout the film does it look natural. Navarro handles the film's night/dark scenes to look cold with a blue palette, while he exhibits the daytime sequences to feel very warm. The camera captures what it needs to establish the scene and support the ideas that del Toro wants the scenes to project. I hope this collaboration keeps on going in future films as both seem to have a great understanding of each other's intentions. \n\nThe film's score was handled by Javier Navarrete who has worked with del Toro previously on The Devil's Backbone and Cronos. His score here doesn't draw attention to itself, but rather subtly emerges in order to sell a scene or to avoid the scene from feeling still. The only time when Navarrete's score stands out is when it uses the lullaby in the film, as it stays with you throughout and even when it ends. The score didn't sound too melodramatic or did it feel too cliche'd but it definitely didn't show that it was a force to be reckon with.\n\nIvana Baquero plays the film's protagonist. She played the part well but it never got to a point where I was amazed or inspired by her work, Baquero just performed what was required in order to come off as tolerable. Sergi Lopez on the other hand was a standout, maybe it also is due to how well written his role is. Lopez succeeds to come off as ruthless and threatening without having to be so obvious to us on how 'evil' this guy really is. Which is the reason why his moments of violence comes off as a shock rather than just something that is expected. Maribel Verdu did her part well as Mercedes. She was able to play off as an 'inside man' character while also be a caring older sister for Ofelia. Doug Jones as Pan (Faun) was a delight to watch as he was able to project himself as someone who is bizarre but also frightening.\n\nMy opinion of Pan's Labyrinth may be in the minority but I cannot say that this film is not worth a watch as it has the ability to create a bridge between reality and fantasy and coming off it satisfied with what Guillermo del Toro has crafted for us.",

Although presenting a pre-adolescent girl as the central protagonist suggests a film for kids (as does some of the cuter digital imagery), the violence is too extreme.  Del Toro isn't just enamored with style (as Tim Burton now seems to be) but aims for an underlying psychological truth (shopworn though it may be).  Setting the film just after the Spanish Civil War also allows him to take advantage of the spookier feel of period costumes and settings.  Above all, the phantasmagorical creatures (encountered during the \"tasks\" that the young girl must complete to achieve her entry to the underworld) make this worth watching.",

It's good to see that Spanish films show their vices to the world when this is a time where patriotism blindfolds the mind of people. We can never expect such an effort from Hollywood or from India. Pan's Labyrinth has a lot of horror elements in it. The fantasy story is all right, but it was the war drama that made this thing compelling. Also it was interesting to see how the director merged the two in the end, the war drama and the fantasy. This is a great film.",

A girl and her mother set to live with her new husband, a sadistic captain in the Spanish Army. She discovers a stone labyrinth where she comes across a faun. The faun claims she is the legendary princess foretold in a legendary story. To prove she is the chosen one she must accomplish three tasks before the next full moon. I like to think of this film as a graphic fairy tale not for the pre teens. The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles, but it's not bothersome as you'll be paying too much attention to the beautiful set pieces, inventive characters and the vast lighting and composition its cinematography has to offer. This is one of the most technically accomplished films I've seen. Guillermo del Tero who wrote and directed this film has created something very unique and adventurous that keeps you on your feet and unleash your emotions as to what is going on in the film whether its the girl stuck in a dead end during her quests or drawing anger at the cruel punishment her stepfather brings to his people. del Toro has cemented his place among the best filmmakers of today. Everyone who is into fantasy stories such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc. will really enjoy this movie. Pan's Labyrinth is one of the few masterpieces to come out in the last ten years. And it will continue to be a masterpiece as time moves on.",

The acting is superb, the story is interesting, the backgrounds darkly beautiful, the camera work is superb and the special effects are stunningly original. It respects the audience enough to decide for themselves what is going on and has 2 stories overlapping throughout.\nThis was by far my favorite film of 2006 and still is one of my favorite movies of all time. I cannot recommend this movie enough.\nThe only advice I can give is to watch it in Spanish with subtitles to get the full impact of the amazing acting throughout.",

It could've been softened down to PG-13, but that would've lessened the impact of certain key moments. The violence also served to develop the main antagonist into someone impossible not to hate: a truly cruel villain. The themes of fantastical wonders and a child's curiosity are effectively contrasted by the harsh realities of life and adults' disbelief.\n\nThe fairy tale part was magical, relatively simple, but by far the most interesting. I wish more time was spent on it. The other half of the plot was vital to the story's progression, but it arguably got too much screen time and, for the most part, was completely separate. In the end, they become intertwined, but for the vast majority of the time I was wishing for the enchanting fairy tale part to return more often.\n\nAlso the lead girl does some really asinine things in the name of suspense and drama.",

            "content": "Despite being quite a prominent name in cinema just now, director Guillermo del Toro hasn't actually made that many movies. He came to attention in 1993 with his excellent feature debut \"Cronos\" before Hollywood quickly took note and employed him on such films as \"Mimic\" and \"Blade II\". However, his strengths lie in his own original work where he retains creative control. Of which, there are three that really stand out; the aforementioned \"Cronos\" is one, \"The Devil's Backbone\" another and \"Pan's Labyrinth\" - which to this day, remains his masterpiece. \n Following the Spanish Civil War in 1944, young Ofelia (Baquero) moves to a rural town with her pregnant mother (Gil) to live with her Fascist military stepfather (L\u00c3\u00b3pez) who is determined to weed out resistance fighters to Franco's dictatorship. It's in this remote town that Ofelia meets a faun in the centre of a labyrinth who tells her that she is a princess. However, to claim her rightful place in this magical land she must perform certain gruesome tasks to prove her royalty.\n It's hard to pigeon hole a film like Pan's Labyrinth as there are so many facets to it's structure. On the one hand, it's a political/historical drama and on the other it's a fantasy/horror. Few (if any) films will spring to mind when these genres are mentioned in the same breath which reflects the very craftsmanship that's at work here. One thing that you can undoubtedly count on, though, is it's highly imaginative nature. Sure, we've had fantastical stories before where a young girl escapes her constrained life to enter bigger and more possible worlds. We've also had commentaries on the brutalities and restrictions of fascist regimes but to combine them into a wondrous journey of life, struggle and imagination is an amalgamation that I have rarely witnessed. Such is the case with this film and such is the skill of del Toro in his writing and  handling of the material. He incorporates an abundance of childhood fantasies, from delving into books and mythology - that feature fauns and fairies - to the power of a piece of chalk on the wall. This may be built around the point of view of a child's eye but its also not afraid to explore the darker recesses of that very imagination and construct some of the most monstrous creatures that can inhabit that realm. Del Toro is in absolute command here and he's aided, immeasurably, by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro in capturing and contrasting his world within a world; one is a visually striking and enchanting fantasia, the other a stark and brutal reality. It's a balance that's difficult to achieve but with deft handling of coexisting genres, del Toro's vision is able to come to fruition and manages to be both a reminder of the rigidity of fascism and the escapable ability of an imaginary youthful mind.\n To embody the young protagonist, we are gifted an outstanding performance from Ivana Baquero who carries a heavy weight on her young shoulders and does so, with a skill beyond her years. Sergi Lopez also provides marvellous support as  the bestial Captain Vidal who's a smouldering villain that's on a par with any of the war genre's nastiest characters.\n It's very difficult to find criticism in this film as there simply, isn't any. The only one that stands is in the film's title. It's slightly misleading as \"Pan\" never actually features here. The original international title translates as \"Labyrinth of the Fuan\" which is probably the most pedantic gripe you'll ever hear from me.\n A stunning piece of work that's both beautifully and horrifically executed. Modern masterpiece is a term that gets brandished around too often these days but this is one that's certainly deserving of such praise.\n\nMark Walker",

Like the revolutionists around, Ofelia understands the importance of sacrificing and protecting what is innocent, and what grew out of this resistance was a chance for new life to grow. Guillerme del Toro creates a beautifully crafted story based in a wondrous world, and is not afraid to cross traditional boundaries, which is definitely applaudable.

I did like this movie. ^.^\n\nThere was so many things going on at once during this movie. The poor rebels trying to fight against Pedro and his \"sadistic\" ways, Pedro and his wife struggling with her being sickly and about to give birth, and then Ofelia's fantasy world which has its own drama unfolding. I loved how well everything blended into each other and how well things played off each other. \n\nI loved the costumes and it seemed very authentic. I also must extend some kuddos to the screen writers for it was some good writing. The dialogue was excellent and the acting added to it. Even the little actress who played Ofelia did wonderful (you know child actors tend to be cheesy sometimes). We had to read the subtitles, because the dialogue was in Spanish, but that was okay...it seemed to be better in Spanish and it added to the feel of the movie. \n\nEven though this was a really good movie, it was really sad. :/ I teared up a couple times throughout the film. Along with that...I hated the ending. I can't say much without ruining it, but it was rather sad and it made me mad. Stupid ending >.>. I see the symbolism behind it, but still I was not happy. Don't get me wrong it wasn't a BAD ending or anything, but it upset me and mad me cry. Oh well, I guess. But it did lead to a good conversation and debate on whether or not Ofelia's \"fantasy\" was a fantasy or not. Was her world real or was it just the imagination of a lonely child in a dark world. Personally...I think it was real in a way. I'll have to re-watch it and look deeper into it.\n\nIn the end, this was a good movie. It's also a good date movie *wink wink*. It was a sad movie, but it was good and thought provoking. The acting, the screenwriting, the costumes, and the plot was amazing. Make sure to watch it in its native language with subtitles, for it seemed to add to the movie. Overall I shall stamp this with 5 stars.\n\nFavorite Character(s): Ofelia, Doctor, & Mercedes\nNot-so Favorite Character(s): Videl (evil man), Pan, & Pale Man (*shudders*)",

While there, Ofelia wonders into the forest and daydreams, meeting a bizarre creature called \"faun\" (Doug Jones) who claims that she is the Princess Moanna and that she is the one who help him and other bizarre creatures, along with her pregnant mother, who becomes very, very ill. At the same time, Ofelia's vicious stepfather starts his kill into the forest and begins murdering those who he believes have betrayed him and Spain, including dictator De Franco (who presided over Spain for more than thirty years).\n\nExceptionally grim but devastating and stunning piece of work that will leave anyone haunted for days. The performances of Baquero and Lopez are unforgettable, as well as Meribel Verdu, the wonderful and helpful housekeeper whose brother is trying to takedown the captain and his crew.

It's a fairy tale of such potency and grandeur, that it reconnects the adult imagination to our primal thrill, and horror stories that held us spellbound as children. As gruesome and brutal as it is enchanting and spellbinding--\"Pan's Labyrinth\" is a movie intended for adults. It is a harsh, uncompromising film--but equally just as beautiful and moving.\"Pan's Labyrinth\" is itself a narrative maze, with multiple stories that branch apart and back together again. \n\nThis dark fairy tale plays out against the backdrop of Spain in 1944. A monstrous Fascist captain (L\u00f3pez) is determined to flush out soldiers of the resistance, as his pregnant wife arrives at his countryside headquarters with her young daughter. The young girl Ofelia (Baquero), escapes the brutality of her new environment by drifting into a fantasy world where she comes across a mysterious faun. The faun tells her that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. The faun also tells that her that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three challenging and dangerous assignments first. \nOfelia's challenges do not arise like arbitrary plot obstacles--they are organic to her (and the movie's) development. She learns not only to follow instructions--and that there are heavy prices to pay for failing to abide by them. But also to trust her own instincts about what is right and wrong. In order to find her true self, she must also find the her inner-strength to break the rules imposed by authority. An individual conscience. What could be a more powerful anti-fascist weapon than that?\n\nIn a dark, harsh, and violent world, Ofelia lives in her magical world trying to survive her tasks and see her father again. Soon, the line between fantasy and reality begins to blur, and before Ofelia can turn back, she finds herself at the center of the ferocious battle between Good and Evil. Incredibly unique fable that blends fantasy and fearsome violence, ultimately merging the two stories together. Superbly realized--a rare film that invites repeated viewings to fully absorb all that writer-director del Toro has put into it. Oscar winner for Cinematography, Makeup, and Art Direction.",

As gruesome and brutal as it is enchanting and spellbinding, \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is a movie intended for adults. It is a harsh, uncompromising film, but equally just as beautiful and moving.\"Pan's Labyrinth\" is itself a narrative maze, with multiple stories that branch apart, and eventually reconnect. \r\n\r\nThis dark fairy tale plays out against the backdrop of Spain in 1944. A monstrous Fascist captain (L\u00f3pez) is determined to flush out soldiers of the resistance as his pregnant wife arrives at his countryside headquarters with her young daughter. The young girl Ofelia (Baquero), escapes the brutality of her new environment by drifting into a fantasy world where she comes across a mysterious faun. The faun tells her that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. The faun also tells that her that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three challenging and dangerous assignments first. Ofelia's challenges do not arise like arbitrary plot obstacles -- they are organic to her (and the movie's) development. She learns not only to follow instructions--and that there are heavy prices to pay for failing to abide by them, while learning to trust her own instincts. In order to find her true self, she must also find the her inner-strength to break the rules imposed by authority -- an individual conscience. \r\n\r\nIn a dark, harsh, and violent world, Ofelia lives in her magical world trying to survive her tasks and see her father again. Soon, the line between fantasy and reality begins to blur, and before Ofelia can turn back, she finds herself at the center of the ferocious battle between Good and Evil. Incredibly unique fable that blends fantasy and fearsome violence, ultimately merging the two stories together. Superbly realized--a rare film that invites repeated viewings to fully absorb all that writer-director del Toro has put into it. Oscar winner for Cinematography, Makeup, and Art Direction.",

The harsh reality that is Ofelia's life with the sadistic army officer Captain Vidal is beautifully balanced with the equally dark but vastly more enjoyable fantasy land she creates. Ivana Baquero, who was only 12 when the film was made is an incredible child actor who was able to portray such extreme emotions for someone so young. You really believed she was upset/scared/furious at all the appropriate moments and she led the audience on her journey very naturally.\n\nIt's completely warranted that the film won 3 Oscars for it's visual elements (Art Direction, Cinematography and Makeup) because it was truly a treat to watch. The creatures were straight out of a vivid imagination and they moved and spoke as characters rather than just people in funny costume.\n\nAnd finally, I'm a big lover of horror and gore and this film incorporated that in moments that took me completely by surprise. One moment I was in awe of the beautiful creatures and sets and the next someone was getting brutally beaten or killed. But it wasn't excessive and it was done so artistically that it really just added to the overall brilliance of the film. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favour and rent it out. Yes, there are subtitles and they are a deterrent for some people but if you can overcome that you won't regret it.",

It also isn't shy about the fact the otherworld - while itself not portrayed as a place of perfection - is literally an escape for this girl from a horrific reality on our human side of things.  A reality which is also not afforded any less development than it deserves - there are no magical girl comicbook storylines of flitting off to an otherworld while nothing goes on back at home and no one's wondering where you are in this film.
