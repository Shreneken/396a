    "summary": "After a group of friends graduate from Delhi University, they listlessly haunt their old campus, until a British filmmaker (Alice Patten) casts them in a film she's making about freedom fighters under British rule. Although the group is largely apolitical, the tragic death of a friend owing to local government corruption awakens their patriotism. Inspired by the freedom fighters they represent in the film, the friends collectively decide to avenge the killing.",

The initial hour seems like buddy rom-com types, but then it almost smacks you in the face a couple of times, and ends up being one of the best patriotic films ever made.",

Ideas like patriotism and truth are easy things to root for when it comes to building motivation behind a protagonistic force. However, when you have main characters veer into assassination and terrorist-like behavior, that's when you really have to tread lightly as a filmmaker. Nuance can even play an interesting role at this point. The idea of vengeance turning people into the very thing they sought to destroy is always compelling. Tragically, though, that kind of commentary and awareness is not really something the film finds all too interesting. So with that, you're left with an emotionally expressive, yet idealistically misplaced anthem of semi-justified self-righteousness. Thankfully, Aamir Khan is always a welcomed presence.",

It engages brilliantly with themes of corruption, independence, patriotism and loyalty.\n\nRang De Basanti focuses on the young British female-maker Sue who travels to India to make a film about Indian Revolutionaries.  She casts five young men in the roles and whilst they are initially hesitant, they grow more and more into the roles until they become revolutionaries themselves.  They fight for freedom from their oppressive families and their oppressive culture.  This was a really interesting backdrop for the film.\n\nStylistically the film is also brilliant.  The main narrative is interspersed with flashbacks showing the original Indian revolutionaries.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/UCWzZ6",

This movie critically did two things : 1. brought the story of India's pre-independence revolutionaries to the current generation. 2. highlighted the issue of Indian Air Force's aging MiG-21 squadron (78 crashes as stated during the credits) and government corruption in arms deals. In real life, this 2005 movie taught the Indian youth about social activism and that they could speak out and make a change. Other than that, it features a white actress speaking very fluent hindi (i'm envious!) and the whole '3 Idiots' cast is present, along with hotties Siddarth and Kunal Kapoor. The 5 friends hired by Sue to enact the revolutionaries' story find themselves facing real-life drama after their friend's MiG-21 crashes and he dies. The scene in the radio station and Daljit going on air was ingenious. And Great AR Rahman tune 'Tu Bein Bataye'! But otherwise, not a perfect film. http://www.caleidoscope.in/caleidoscope-blog/remember-mig-21-remember-rang-de-basanti",

            "content": "One of the most excellently made Hindi movies in a long time.... The movie excels in almost every aspect of film making. direction by Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra and AR Rahman's music are the standouts. A movie that started a revolution in the way that people in general started expressing their frustrations in a different way all altogether, aka candle light vigil which is derived from one of the key scenes in the movie. This movie came out when the MIG planes in the Indian army were under fire from the general public for killing the pilots inside them. It was notoriously known as the \"widow maker\". The movie starts off with a filmmaker from UK who wants to tell the story of Bhagat singh through her docu-drama, once she reaches India she meets these seemingly bunch of brats who are virtually carefree and hate the Indian political scenario. Then  one of their friend dies in a MIG crash and their life is turned upside down. They try to change the system from the inside but fail miserably in their \"legal\" attempts. Unable to bear the frustration they change themselves into rebels to bring about a change in the government. What ensues after this forms the crux of the story but let me give you a heads up, it gets better from that point.... Starring a cast of new comers along with veteran actors and Aamir Khan as the gang's leader were all amazingly believable and did a great job at touching your emotional strings. The background draws you in at pivotal points in the movie. The interplay  and comparison of these bunch of brats and Bhagat Singh's life is among the most entertaining parts of the movie as it captures their change from peaceful students to rebellious revolutionaries. The movie's climax has some of the best dialogues in the movie. A must watch and one of the greatest movie that bollywood has ever come up with. A masterpiece.\n\nIts difficult to make a patriotic movie in India, in a way this movie is a satire of its own genre as most of the characters have the same view that modern audience have come to associate with patriotism but that soon changes through the commencement of the movie and the patriotic flare is ignited. Powered by some tremendous performances from the cast, beautiful music be AR Rahman and tremendously appealing lyrics by Prasoon Joshi not to forget Om Prakash Mehra at the helm. One of my all time favorite movies in Hindi, brilliant and memorable. A new breed of patriotism.\n\nTo cite a dialogue from the movie in a way that conveys what I want to say perfectly: \n\n\"There are two kinds of movies: Once that make a lot of noise and the ones that just fade away quietly...... Then I saw the third kind.\" Rang De Basanti",

            "content": "rang de basanti,\r\n\r\noh rang de basanti! rang de basanti! rang de basanti oh hoi!\r\n\r\nInitially beginning as an average, time-pass movie, the film matures and develops into an immensely inspirational and patriotic experience.\r\n\r\nAs always, Aamir Khan proves to be a very unique, often original and praise-worthy actor.  Shaman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor, Atul Kulkarni, and Siddarth also acted terrifically well, though none truly impressed me to new standards.  Although I carried no expectations, Soha Ali Khan's (Saif Ali Khan's sister) and Alice Pattern's acting was average; below average for top-box office movie standards.  Regardless I laud the director Rakeysh Mehra for undertaking young, fresh actors into the film to maintain film focus and to stick closely with the genuineness of the presentation and story than veer the audience's attention towards the actors/actresses.\r\n\r\nThough it was slightly predictable, the film's plot developed so well it resonated for days beyond the scope of the film and into my life.  It was more than a film, it was an inspiration, a call to believe in yourself and to fight for what is right, whether the war be for yourself, your country, for good.\r\n\r\nPassionate about India's historically strong but nonviolent fight for independence from England, London-resident Sue becomes fed up with the English's ignorant and unappreciative view of India that she decides to move to India and shoot a documentary about some of India's most prominent independence heroes.  After asking her friend's gang if they were willing to act in her documentary,  the unserious college kids find her script for the documentary (which illustrate some of India's eminent independence heroes) too serious and dramatic, especially to the current time period.  Through time, they eventually understand the seriousness of the film and India's history, helping Sue's documentary progress and develop.  Admist their film-making and having fun elsewhere, one of the guys of the group (who is a pilot) dies flying after the engine of his government-issued plane fails.  Provided that the plane was going to crash into a city where a good number of people would have died because of the plane, he sacrifices himself by not ejecting himself from his seat to steer the dying plane away from the city and to crash in an empty field instead.  Distraught from the accident, the gang soon learns that the accident wasn't pure misfortune and that the corrupted government was essentially responsible for it; it had bought cheaper flight engines and parts to bring in more profit.  This new knowledge fires the friends up and completely transforms our fun-loving, unserious, cheerful, characters into a passionate, good-caused leaders fighting for justice and against corruption.  The director illustrates this transformation well by often paralleling the characters with actual Indian heroes.\r\n\r\nThis film is a must-see, not just for Indians, but for all of us of the passion-disabled, always-adjusting, unconfident generation.  The big message of this movie is to speak out, be heard, and fix what is wrong in a country and world where so many wrongs outnumber rights.\r\n\r\nA call to action, the message isn't necessarily motivating us to fix politics and corrupt governments, but to find a passion and speak out for it, support it, live in it, believe in it.  It's a call to action to believe.\r\n\r\nIf you haven't seen it yet, you're literally missing out on an exciting, inspirational, motivational fire that the film will ignite within you.",
