Worldwide civil war looms as normal people, feeling threatened by their enhanced brethren, demand the extermination of the group. One such transformed female (Milla Jovovich) finds herself caught in the crossfire when she becomes the protector of a boy who is perceived to be a threat to humanity.",

The pacing in this is so bizarrely off...the first 40 minutes are nonstop stupid over the top action that never breathes and than we slow down to boring expose nonstop back to terrible final battles. The cinematography is atrocious with HORRIFIC CGI sweeping shots, over the top action, shot with bizarre obnoxious camera angles for good measure. Half the time the shots have a glossy color saturation to them as well that's distracting and looks like some kind of lubricant is on the screen. The music isn't bad as much as it puts you to sleep during boring expose and makes it even worse. It's just used in bad ways. The editing is horrible as well. The crowning achievement aside from the CGI is without a doubt Milla Jovovich. Her character Violet is so over the top, out of place, exaggerated and stupid while always trying to look like a badass its fascinating. It brings the level of acting to the type of performances you see in Kazam or The Super Mario Bros. Movie. This is so bad it's good at least the first 40 minutes. If you wanna see something awful but good just watch the first 40 minutes of this and than turn it off.",

            "content": "A strange sci-fi story with often hilariously bad acting and cool swordplay!\n\nDirector Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) somehow lost all his taste, yet delivers an all style with little substance for his science-fiction action-thriller Ultraviolet (2006). I cannot believe Kurt Wimmer directed the beautiful and touching Equilibrium as well as the gaudy and melodramatic Ultraviolet. I do have a soft spot for Ultraviolet as it's so bad that it is genuinely entertaining.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Ultraviolet was constantly used in blu-ray advertisements for ultra-violet high definition as the Sony digital cameras used for Ultraviolet look hideous now. Why does every person have a glow to them? Ultraviolet's CGI is horrendous. Visual effects artists Steven Calcote, Neil Greenberg, Victor Wong, and Rongguo Fang made near video game cutscene level garbage for the wide shots of the city and ships flying awkwardly. It looks like Playstation 1 level graphics. The glowing purple fringes of Violet's hair looked neat and the practical effect of the flaming swords in the darkness is killer. Ultraviolet's effects are so hit or miss.\n\nArthur Wong Ngok-Tai's cinematography has all these inspired wide shots that look neat still and his hyper stylized camera work makes the sword and gunfights look cool at least. Alongside Kurt Wimmer's frenetic direction, Ultraviolet stabs, shoots, and slashes into glorious mediocrity. Choo Sung Pong's production design looks like its $30 million low budget. Many of the sets just look like Hong Kong and China where Ultraviolet was filmed. The sci-fi buildings are neat in a way, but never believable. Bernardo Trujillo, Chong Kwok-Wing, and William Kan's art direction is too cartoony to ever feel grounded. Roberto Bonelli, Chung Kim Wai, and Rufina Lo's sparse set decoration is minimalist for that sci-fi feel. It can also feel empty though.\n\nThere's plenty of style to Wimmer's direction with Ultraviolet's sleek and sterile world, afraid of disease, but there's just too much of everything. We never get to know Violet as it's all running around shooting people. Wimmer's writing just rips off The Matrix' action with Underworld's world and vampire lore and blood concepts to Blade's swordplay style. Ultraviolet has a place in my heart as one of the most entertaining bad movies ever made. Editor William Yeh's rapid and confusing cuts are so bafflingly bad. It looks like a parody of itself during the fights and the conversations look slick, but often veer off into the absurd. It's infamously terrible for a reason with awkward dialogue and hilariously bad acting from the supporting cast. \n\nMilla Jovovich is surprisingly fun as Violet with her lethal threats and killer sword choreography. She's a real action star and even delivers a bit of dramatic acting that can be bad, but she's not the problem with Ultraviolet. Cameron Bright is pretty deadpan as this sympathetic sick kid. Nick Chinlund is outrageous as the way too over the top dictator. His final fight is cool alongside Milla Jovovich, but his delivery is so mid-2000's. Sebastien Andrieu is awful as this strange French rebel. William Fichtner is fantastic and empathetic as Garth with a more sincere and nuanced performance. He's just a great actor even in garbage. All the other supporting actors are horrible, but laughably so, honestly.\n\nComposer Klaus Badelt's score has epic symphonic elements and fun techno throughout Ultraviolet, so I cannot complain about the music very much. The sound team came up with intense gun firing noises, but mixed these noises too quietly compared to the blaring score. The sword swinging noises are great. I actually love costume designers Joseph A. Porro and Jackie Cheng's skin tight bodysuits for Milla. They're colorful, sexy, and cool. They always show off her tight abs with a bare midriff among her ever changing tops and pants with these knee high boots. The purple wig on Milla is very pretty. Gemma Waugh and Marie Nardella's make-up is lovely for Milla as she looks angelic.\n\nIn all, Ultraviolet is a fairly fast paced 87 minutes of over the top acting and even crazier action sequences within this ultra serious sci-fi story. Can you believe this was actually about a vampire causing disease and a ruthless dictatorship that Milla Jovovich slashes through with her rectangular sword?",

            "content": "\"It's Milla time!\" Yes, I confess, I watched this to see Milla \"Violet\" do her thing in this flick. I loved her, loved her, loved her in The Fifth Element and her Resident Evil work was okay too. Ultraviolet has a barely acceptable plot, somewhat engaging screen adaptation, very impressive CGI overall, top-notch cinematography taste & vision. Milla looks spectacular and action scenes were well-done. I enjoyed 90% of this bombastic sci-fi, heroine extravaganza. Nanotech'd weaponry and bullets \"from outta nowhere\" was a new twist for me but how they could be fashioned so incredibly fast is beyond the hard-science I understand -- unless the weapons and ammo pre-existed in some quasi-energy-matter state, superpacked in storage for rapid retrieval. The 10% of the movie that failed me was the CGI'd motorcycle chase looked a but comic-booky in spots and NOT realistic. Never mind what Violet pulled off was essentially impossible, it just looked a bit unfinished in the CGI arena, textures not added in spots, breaking glass looking too drawn versus really breaking, small stuff really but it is just that sort of special effects that makes special effects NOT special. If you can tell is is CGI-done then it is subpar work. You shouldn't see most special effects other than slo-mo, ramping and the stuff we all were wow'd by in The Matrix. One last beef -- how in the world does Violet dodge 25 or thirty gun experts shooting at her at close range from 360 degrees surrounding her? Sure. maybe the first couple guys are stupid enuff to die in crossfire but ALL of them doing that? Please So, overall decent flick.",

It's a different approach to vampires (hemophages), it's a different approach to sci-fi, and it's a different approach to corporate dystopia.  Oddly, the Umbrella Corporation from \"Resident Evil\" is the closest of which I can think.\n\nMilla Jovovich is entirely capable of performing high action sequences, and carrying the movie, which she does wonderfully.  I don't doubt that she has some pull in the production process, but the problems in this are mostly the weak character work and the \"I have this really cool idea I'd like to do on screen, it'll be totally different than anything else out there.\" of it all.\n\nSome of it (nose plugs) are actively distracting, and other things are just odd choices (squared off sword), while there are cool concepts (dimensionally printed weapons), and scenes that just look cool even if they're not especially practical or sensisble (swords on fire in the dark).\n\nMy only personal gripes are day walking vampires, weird foley sounds for the guns (most are right, but it is hard to tell on made up guns), and why in the hell people with guns would charge someone instead of firing.\n\nI think this movie holds up as good as it did when it was released, and I have a good time re-watching it.",

What's my excuse? I don't know, I'm guess I'm a glutton for bad-movie punishment. I paid the dime so I was forcing myself to do the time.\n\nActing: 0\n\nBeginning: 3\nNo, it doesn't take sixteen minutes to decide this movie is horrible. It's really more like ten. The beginning sets the movie up in no particularly clever way. It explains the laughable Blood Wars and tries to get you to care about the main character.

You'll understand that reference if you decide to take the awful journey that is this movie.\n\nCharacters: 5\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 2\nDuring the making of this, someone actually presented the idea, \"So how cool would it be if the main character could change outfits on the spots like three times in every scene?\" The worst part is, someone actually agreed with that dunderhead. The outfits are only a smidge of what makes the cinematics so bad. The special effects are a nightmare which bog down the actions scenes. The world itself is so cardboard that you feel like a backdrop will fall down at any moment. I really don't know what the angle was here.\n\nConflict: 3\nEvery single bodyguard in this world should be fired. I really don't think the main character gets touched the entire movie as she tears through people left and right. My annoyance level was through the roof with the weak action sequences from start to finish. They were focused too much on making things look cool than they were having actual scenes with meat.\n\nEntertainment Value: 3\nAfter you get done cringing at how bad this movie is, you will finally settle in. You might just have a laugh or two at how utterly ridiculous and stupid this movie is. That, to me, is worthy of a 3.\n\nMemorability: 4\n\nPace: 3\nAt one point during the movie, when they had a chance to dive full into more action, they decide instead to have a sequence where the main character and the boy she is protecting stop to play at a playground. This should tell you all you need to know about how slow this movie moves. The fact that you really don't understand what's happening the entire movie only serves to make things even worse. Nightmare.\n\nPlot: 5\nI am being very generous. I will admit I do have a soft spot in my heart for sci-fi as I feel there are a lot of moving parts with character building and world creation.  With Ultraviolet, it's not just bad sci-fi, it's bad PERIOD.\n\nResolution: 4\n\nOverall: 32\nI will leave you with this: Sitting through this movie will make you a dumber person. That is all.",

On more than one occasion, I have written that there's nothing more frustrating than watching someone else play a video game. Now I have found an exception to the rule - watching someone cheat while playing a video game. Because that's what the makers of Ultraviolet do: cheat. The live actors appear as computer generated as the backgrounds. Considering the lack of humor and emotion displayed by the performers, one might assume that their only participation was to allow their three-dimensional images to be programmed into a computer and reproduced.

The script is cringier than romance in a Star Wars prequel, Milla Jovovich's performance was terrible (yet she gets a full star because which straight man can say no to an action girl who's in midriff-baring clothing for nearly the entire movie?), the action sequences, while cool in concept and likely looked much better when they were storyboarded ended up being incoherent, boring and one-sided, not to mention jarringly bloodless, something that is more nitpicky when you notice that the bad guys are in white clothing in a brightly lit room and the visual effects. My goodness, the effects. I can see why Kurt Wimmer stuck permanently to writing after this movie because the effects are some of the worst I have seen in a 21st-century blockbuster in quite a while. Theyre so blatantly unfinished! It doesn't help that the movie's really short which had a clear effect on the movie's pacing.

The tone of the movie is one of high art, but it stinks like a landfill. It doesn't matter that the acting is wooden, the storyline is incomprehensible, and the action sequences are plodding. All the filmmakers care about is that there's a dash of panache to the proceedings. It's hard to argue that Ultraviolet has a unique look. The live actors appear as computer generated as the backgrounds. Considering the lack of humor and emotion displayed by the performers, one might assume that their only participation was to allow their three-dimensional images to be programmed into a computer and reproduced. MillaJovovich- never a strong actress- is at home here but even she can't salvage much. Ultraviolet is a waste of time.",

I understand that the director and Jovavich were shut out of the editing phase of the movie, and were both very angry about what the studio did to shorten the film and emphasis action over story. Too bad that we'll never get to see the full 122 minute film, as the cut scenes might have added in more of the human interaction the final film gives short shrift to. Nevertheless, the film is fast paced, the fight scenes are choreographed like a cross between martial arts and dancing, and it looks good. Also, she kills 700 guys in black armor; she's no slacker. \n\nI'll agree that the film plot is thin, but there's enough there to make me care about Violet, and to cheer her on when she goes to rescue six. 700 men, guys!
