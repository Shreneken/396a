            "content": "A Night At The Opera is very silly at times, but it is absolutely hilarious. A simply brilliant film, with so many memorable scenes, that is guaranteed to have you in tears of laughter. The Marx Brothers do a superlative job here with their zany antics, and their rough-around- the-edges humour was truly unique. The cinematography was fabulous, the pace was fast moving, the screenplay was inventive and phenomenally witty, and the plot is effective enough without being contrived.\n\nThe romance between the two songbirds Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle was sweet, and while it has thought been thought to be of irrelevance to the story, it didn't detract too much for me to enjoy this film. The music is wonderful as well. As for my favourite scene I can't possibly choose as there were so many priceless scenes. The contract scene between Groucho and Chico was unforgettable, as was the ruination of Il Trovatore which happens to be one of the best comedy climaxes. But my favourite scene, if I had to choose, is the shenanigans inside Groucho's cabin on the transatlantic liner, it is quite simply one of the silliest scenes in comedy history. All in all, a true comedy classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "A NIGHT AT THE OPERA (MGM, 1935) directed by Sam Wood, re-introduces the Marx Brothers to the screen following their five years at the Paramount studio (1929-1933) to MGM, this being the start of a new beginning and the end to their wild world of comedy. It also brings forth their most popular comic foil of all, Margaret Dumont, from their Broadway to Paramount days, and the return to a formula story and time out for musical interludes either by the brothers or the romantic lovers originally done in their initial films of THE COCOANUTS (1929) and ANIMAL CRACKERS (1930). Aside from now being The Three Marx Brothers (Zeppo who has since retired), their characters have been toned down a bit, which helps. However, at MGM, with this, their best film for the studio, Groucho and Harpo become victims instead of instigators, with such notable scenes as Harpo employed as a dresser for an abusive opera tenor (Walter Wolfe King) who slaps, hits and uses a whip on him (at one point off camera) whenever getting out of line with his buffoonery, and Groucho, who always wins out in every situation physically and verbally, getting kicked down four flights of stairs, which indicates they are not always indestructible, yet remain in character from the old days whenever possible. Chico retains his wiseacre Italian character, remaining notably the same from his previous efforts, however, things will start to change not for the better for him and his brothers in the movies to follow.\n\nPlot summary: Introduction takes place in Milan, Italy, where Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho) agrees to represent dowager Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) into society by arranging for her to invest $200,000 to Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman), director of the opera company so that he can afford to bring opera singers Rudolpho Lassparri (Walter King) and Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle) to New York City. Rudolpho loves Rosa, but she is more interested in Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones), an unknown singer working as a chorus-man, but with the help of Fiorelli (Chico), acting as his manager, and his partner, Tomasso (Harpo), the trio head for America by becoming stowaways on the S.S. Americus, hiding out in Driftwood's tiny stateroom in order for Ricardo to get his big chance as a singer. After Driftwood and his cronies arrive in at the Metropolitan Opera House, thanks to them in disrupting Rudolpho's performance that the art of opera will never be the same again.\n\nThe musical program: \"Alone\" (sung by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones) by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed; \"Cosi-Cosa\" (sung by Allan Jones) by Bronislau Kaper, Walter Jurmann and Ned Washington; \"All I Do is Dream of You\" (by Brown and Freed/piano solo by Chico Marx); \"Alone\" (harp solo by Harpo Marx); and selections from Il Trovatore by Guiseppi Verdi: \"Di quella pira,\" \"Miserere,\" \"Anvil Chorus,\" \"Stride la Vampa\" \"Strido lassu\" and \"Miserere.\" Allan Jones and Kitty Carlisle doing their duet, \"Alone,\" him on the pear and she from the boat dock, Chico's fast finger piano playing, and Harpo's harp solo in a serious manner as he performs to a little old lady (facial shadow front only) who looks on approvingly, may not be highlights, but are truly memorable moments.\n\nHighlights: Whenever anyone goes into discussion regarding A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, the first thing that comes immediately to mind is that famous state room scene involving Groucho, Chico and the sleeping Harpo, with various others involved, crammed together until the door opens, having them all falling out like dominoes. This hilarious bit is one that's remembered best with fondness and admiration. However, there are others worth noting: The opening where Dumont awaits for Groucho at a restaurant for an hour only to find him at the table behind her eating with another lady, is priceless; Groucho and Chico contract exchanges that becomes a \"sanity clause\"; arrested stowaway Harpo's attempt in escaping his detention cabin by crawling out of a porthole and hanging onto a rope outside only to be dumped into the ocean; Jones, Chico and Harpo in bearded disguises posing as celebrity aviators to give speeches on coast-to-coast radio, with the silent Harpo covering up his muteness by constantly drinking glasses of water; the disappearance of beds in Groucho's hotel room while the plainclothesman detective (Robert Emmett O'Connor) investigates; and of course, the climactic opera chaos by the Marxes, with one great bit with the orchestra playing the overture to \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" after coming to the page with the planted song sheets, with Groucho acting as a vendor yelling \"Peanuts! Peanuts!\" to the patrons. A classic with Callas.\n\nThe supporting players: Newcomer Allan Jones steps in for the role that might have been offered to Zeppo. He is a likable actor with a fine singing voice who performs well opposite Kitty Carlisle (another recruit from Paramount and rare screen appearance, being best known as the TV panelist in the long running quiz show, \"To Tell the Truth\").",

            "content": "As time goes on, I'm more and more convinced that physical comedy ages much better than dialogue-based humor; the universal nature of the jokes, their simplicity, and lack of a need of context makes them more of a long-term favorite. As a result, Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and Sellers will probably enjoy greater lasting international popularity and acclaim than the two Marx brothers not named Harpo. Groucho Marx has a very distinct brand of comedy that you either like or you don't - fast-talking and oftentimes a bit sloppy on delivery, hoping that quantity will carry the day (and it often does), while Chico is really just the less-endearing counterpart for his brother to play off of. Harpo is consistently solid, offerring a more buffoonish counterpart to his verbose brothers, but he's not a strong comparison to the great solo physical comedians that made a name for themselves in the the decades prior to the rise of the Marx trio. Still, there is something about the dedication to increasingly exasperating, long-running scenes that makes the fraternal act distinctive and endearing, and one of the best representatives of their style is the climactic chaos of A Night at the Opera, in which the three engage in silliness and smooth-talking until an appropriately upbeat conclusion is reached. The actual romantic plot that in theory drives the film is so secondary and tacked on, when it reemerges after long breaks you may often find yourself struggling to remember that it was ever there in the first place. Alongside Duck Soup, probably the longest-lived and most critically acclaimed Marx Brothers film. (4/5)",

            "content": "Marx is the best asset, the highlight of the show, we know it, they knew it, hence the celebration of his talent.\n\nA Night At The Opera\n\nWood feels more like directing some sketch show. There is a lot of empathy visible in the hard work that goes in, on creating the various sketchy scenarios. But when it comes to stage a musical- exception being the piano sequence played around a bunch of kids. But I'd argue that even in that scene, the depth comes from the comic timing that displays this two sides of the characters subsequently- or relevantly moisturize the film with emotional drama, the director, Sam Wood feels like he is leaving those patches out to dry. With gags aplenty, even he knew that this is his strength and he should focus on it- the transaction to what is in paper and then what comes on screen, is sheer brilliance.\n\nAnd I think that is the only thing that holds up with time. For almost a century later, the jokes are tend to not age well and feel a bit overridden by now. But once again, I'd say it is the confidence. Take the scene where they are literally trying to manipulate a man on convincing that he is in the wrong hotel room. The choreography is so smooth and polished with actors performing tasks quickly and with a hilarious body language, that you are left in awe.\n\nNow as much as easy this was easy on paper, it was incredibly difficult to pull off. And as much as I loved and adored that scene. I would go back one act more to define A Night At The Opera. The obvious infamous scene where the physical comedy is practically turned to 11. His small hotel room gets crowded scene by scene and all the actors performing their bits with commitment, no matter whether they are part of the action or not, proves the most difficult task of an actor i.e. to make the audience laugh.",

Yet even as the stateroom scene and the \"sanity clause\" bit are amongst the most legendary in comedy, it's Harpo on his 46 strings, like some demented angel, that best captures their spirit.",

I loved that this movie gave us huge chunks of time in the first act to just enjoy the witty puns of Groucho and Chico. They had me laughing a ton as they talked people in circles, and I almost lost it completely when they started arguing about contracts. This is the kind of stuff that I could watch for hours, because something about that vaudevillian banter appeals to me, and always strikes me as funny. I also love how Groucho downplays his punchlines without calling attention to the fact that he just made a joke. The second act, when they are on the boat, was also delightful. The dialogue was still a treat, and now they added some hilarious physical gags along with the jokes. Stuffing everyone into the small room was in contention for the best scene in the entire movie. It was one of those moments where it starts off funny, but at a certain point you think it\u2019s going too far, until it comes back around and becomes funny again. This is also the section of the film where we get some great music. The opera singers are marvelous, particularly Allan Jones (assuming he does his own singing.) Chico does some of his magic with the piano, and Harpo dazzles with some time on the harp. It all sounded lovely and adds to the quality of the film. Where things kind of fell apart for me was in the final act. It started out well enough with the physical gag with the policeman in the apartment. I didn\u2019t understand why the guys were doing all that nutty stuff, when they were moving things around, but at least it made for some good laughs at the sergeant\u2019s expense. But the gags remained almost entirely physical as things moved to the final scene at the opera. I like a little physical comedy from time to time, but I wanted to get back to the dialogue a little more. It was almost entirely absent through the whole third act, and that was a big letdown. I wish A Night at the Opera hadn\u2019t left me on a sour note, because up until that point I was in love with this film, and it might have been my favorite Marx Brothers movie. I still quite enjoyed it, and will happily watch it again any time.",

            "content": "The Marx Brothers invade the opera houses with their hilarity. As always, the Marx Brothers are great, but the plot actually gets in the way of their magic this time. One of the main components of the story involves a sappy star-crossed couple of opera singers. One of them is an established talent but the other just cannot catch a break to prove his talents. I am highly in favor of a plot with substance and incorporating musical numbers to change the pace, but this time it detracts from the Marx Brothers comedy. The sarcastic and slapstick humor are extremely enjoyable, but things come to a screeching halt with the music numbers. Maybe my attention span was not in full gear, but the continuity is not there. Still for all the shortcomings, there are some iconic scenes. The contract negations and the tiny room with tons of room service people crammed into at one time are sidesplitting. Perhaps the best scene involves Harpo and Chico hiding from an officer in Groucho's room, by shuffling from hiding place to the other. Many consider this the strongest Marx Brother film, but I prefer others to this one.",

Tomasso (Harpo) is also on hand to create his own particular brand of anarchic mischief, all in a bid to secure Groucho's place in the world of opera, install Jones and love interest Kitty Carlisle as the new singing sensations of New York, and make life a living hell for snobbish tenor Walter Woolf King. But who cares about the plot??? The point here is to watch the beloved comedy team work their magic, and this film contains some classic bits: the contract scene, the stateroom scene, and most infamously, the climactic sequence at the opera, where they wreak some of their funniest havoc on a live production of Il Trovatore. While it falls just short of Duck Soup, this production (their first at MGM) boasts a larger budget and classier trappings than before; even the dreaded musical numbers manage to actually CONTRIBUTE to the action rather than distracting from it for once.

It's like an excellent Buster Keaton flick; in fact, the last movie I've seen with so much charm, thrill, wit, timing, action, and romance was Keaton's \"The General\" or \"Steamboat Bill Jr.\" \r\n\r\nEven though the film has the Marx trademark of ridiculous witty jokes constantly thrown at you (I try to say that in the best light possible,) they somehow managed to work in a romance that's touching enough for the ending to be emotionally satisfying, even if said romance felt a bit forced at first. In addition, the extremely blunt and crude editing gives the film an unintentional gritty realism that makes the array of stunts in the film's climax surprisingly heart-pounding, where you simultaneously want to laugh yet, as was with my reaction, are legitimately concerned for the well-being of the actors. Throw in two or three skits that are genuinely extremely funny and by the end of the film your throat will be sore from the laughter and excitement. There's even a very sincere and slowed down musical instrument scene on a boat, involving Chico and Harpo, that's so solemn and tender that you can't help but be surprised at realizing the amount of heart this film has (surely an influential moment as well, even having homage paid to it by greats like Fellini in \"E la nave va.\") \r\n\r\nAll in all, \"A Night of the Opera\" is a thoroughly entertaining film, and an impressively layered one as well, that's much better than your average comedy flick.",

            "content": "Starring the Marx Brothers, this vehicle for their comedy has Groucho, Harpo, and Chico trying to help two lovers earn  positions at the opera. Along the way Groucho tries to marry a rich patron and Chico and Harpo run from the law as stowaways. This film which could be seen as having a dramatic story, is constantly interrupted by Marxian gags. Some memorable moments include the insanity clause, two hard-boiled eggs, Groucho's crowded stateroom, and the final scenes in the opera house. Only with the Marx Brothers would you hear Take Me Out to the Ball Game at the opera. Although Duck Soup has critical acclaim, I find this one more entertaining as comedy with a real story line. The MGM years were ushered in by this film and solidified the Marx Brother's legacy.",

The whole crew is back again, Groucho, Chico and Harpo, all back to their usual wacky characters. Although it's not as complex and interesting as Duck Soup, A Night at the Opera never fails to entertain the viewer. Like any other Marx Brothers movie, there is endless charm, not only in the characters and their actions, but in the dialouge also. Although it's not as good as their most critically aclaimed film (Duck Soup), A Night at the Opera is a classic comedy that should go down as one of the funniest films of all time. \n\nFavorite Scene: Everybody in a Room scene.",

Since most people put it between this and Duck Soup for there best film I'll compare those two. While there were funny moments in here it wasn't as consistent as in Duck Soup. In duck soup I laughed at every single scene, in here I thought some were stupid. The Scene where Harpo and Chico were playing the piano was actually annoying if you ask me, I was staring at the TV pondering why was it even included in the movie. Also this (while it was funny) relied more on physical humor like Harpo swinging on a rope, less than it relied on verbal humor. Yes Grucho had his moments but not as many as in Duck Soup. While it was funny and a good movie, it's not there best work.",

            "content": "It simply does not get any more classic than \"A Night at the Opera.\"  This Marx Brothers masterpiece will crack you up on the first, fifth, and fiftieth viewing.  Classic moments like the stateroom scene are mixed with Groucho's quick-witted one-liners for 92 minutes of cinematic perfection (\"Do you see that man eating spaghetti?  Well, you see the spaghetti, don't you?  Well behind that spaghetti is none other than Herman Gottlieb, manager of the New York Opera Company.\")  The Marx Brothers are perfect in their typical (and delightfully anticipated) roles but the rest of the cast compliments them perfectly.  Margaret Dumont's exasperation makes her the perfect \"straight woman\" for Groucho while Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones have fantastic voices that could qualify them as romantic leads in any film, and Siegfried Rumann is just plain awesome as Gottlieb.  The quality of the supporting cast does not take anything away from Groucho, Chico, and Harpo.  Their antics during the performance of \"Il Trovatore\" (Take Me Out to the Ballgame in the pit, ripping the dancer's skirt on stage, \"How would you like to feel the way she looks?\") are unmatched, not to mention the impressive musical abilities of Chico and Harpo.  I love the musical numbers (particularly \"Cosi Cosa\"), whether they are the original songs written for the movie or the actual opera pieces.  Above all, this is one of the greatest scripts ever written, creating classic scenes like the party-of-the-first-part-contract-scene and the stowaways-hidden-in-Groucho's-hotel-room-and-the-dumb-cop-can't-find-them-sequence.  From start to finish, \"A Night at the Opera\" is non-stop entertainment filled with jokes that become funnier every time that you hear them.",
