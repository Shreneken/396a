After cleaning up and moving from Edinburgh to London, Mark finds he can't escape the life he left behind when Begbie shows up at his front door on the lam, and a scheming Sick Boy follows.",

            "content": "So my favorite story about this film is that I have a Scottish grandmother who would go to our local arthouse theater anytime there was a new movie set in Scotland. Well, here's a new movie about heroin addicts set in her hometown of Edinburgh. I did not watch TRAINSPOTTING with my grandmother, but I do remember asking her what she thought about it and her response was, \"I'd forgotten how much people swear in Scotland.\"\n\nI was pretty excited about this film when it came out because I loved director Danny Boyles' prior film with Ewan McGregor, SHALLOW GRAVE, a jet-black comedy about a group of friends whose new flatmate turns up dead with a suitcase full of cash under his bed. They then struggle whether to keep the money and dispose of the body or do the right thing by going to the authorities. You can guess which direction they go. TRAINSPOTTING is equally dark in its humor but is far more hard-hitting in its take on drug addiction and drug culture. Besides stylish direction, a great cast, a sharply written script, and one of the best soundtracks of all time, I think what sets this film apart from other tales of addiction is that it dared to show the \"fun\" and attraction of the drug addict lifestyle; robbing, conning, and the pleasures of the high of drugs. However, the film goes incredibly dark when the addition get uglier and uglier. I think REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is the only film about addiction that is even harder to watch. While REQUIEM is a masterpiece, it's so hard to watch, it's not a film I really want to revisit, though TRAINSPOTTING, as hard as it is to watch at times, is a fantastic cast of characters who are fun to revisit over and over again (like a drugged addicted British version of the kids in DAZED AND CONFUSED). I still have not watched the T2 sequel because I worry it will not live up to the original, but I should probably go ahead and watch it to see where my drug-addict friends are now in their lives.",

However, unlike Tarantino or Anderson, he does not use an intricate or tortuous language, but a direct and genuine one, able to reach a wide and varied audience. He leads us to sympathize with the protagonists, to reflect on their morality; always with irony and never really condemning their insolence or their immaturity. They are young people who have chosen to live obfuscated by drugs, in sharp contrast to the merely material value of life giving by the modern man, a slave to the decadent contemporary society, who deludes himself to live truly but who is not so different from those who waste their lives.",

You find yourself drawn to Renton and his gang, but will recognize that they are uniformly terrible people, unable to really bring yourself to root for their success. The upbeat soundtrack creates a clear contrast to the barren prospects of the main cast, the thin veneer of color over the raw core. Performances are uniformly solid, especially McGregor as Renton, Bremner as Spud, and Carlyle as Begby. Trainspotting's reputation is deserved, a fully realized representative of its genre. (4.5/5)",

But despite an unchanging end-goal, these are brilliantly sketched characters exhibiting a criminality and shiftlessness that perversely endears.\n\n\"Trainspotting\" showcases elite storytelling by counterpointing the dehumanization of addiction with a truly vibrant humor. This is a classic of the first order. \u2013 WATCHED IT? THEN WATCHLIST: \"Being John Malkovich,\" \"True Romance,\" \"Stadium Anthems.\"",

This is mainly the case for Ewan McGregor, and little for director Danny Boyle, in an unhealthy film that is very well maintained throughout the horrifically gross-out session by how it was exceptionally written in a scripted circle and how it was energetically performed, synergized a stylish adrenaline with a nasty outlook. The drugged warning predictably won't reach those too fogged up in the mind to understand the final episode and costly duration that this film exaggerates as an extent to an instance of unhealthy addiction but hopefully enough as a wakeup call for withdrawal consideration before further into the act. With that flowing through the characters and the mixed signaled influences they have deflecting each other from the skillful written direction, the film from this visitation justifies its unexpected sequel and why it's worth anticipating.

If you want to see a movie with a similar subject matter that leaves far more of an impact, I would recommend the masterful \"Requiem for a Dream.\" This movie is well-acted and uniquely made, but it was just so boring to me. The movie creates a lot of intentional discomfort, but the story went nowhere interesting. It's one of those movies that I feel is pretty overrated and as a whole did not really appeal to me.",

            "content": "Drug addiction is seldom depicted in all it's horror and depravity within a film that is actually enjoyable to watch instead of feeling like poverty porn or a horribly condescending television film of the week. Compared to The Panic in Needle Park (1971) this film is light and breezy and it is all the better for it as you will laugh a lot before feeling a claustrophobic fear as you realize how trapped the affable young men you have followed are. This is in large part due to a well written screenplay from John Hodge that is aware of the dark subject matter it deals with and never fully turns away from it and surprisingly inspired direction from Danny Boyle who I had often dismissed as workmanlike.\n\nYoung heroin addict Mark Renton, Ewan McGregor, is attempting to get himself off drugs while being surrounded by other heroin addicts who he spends most of his time with. One of his friends, the popular and successful soccer player Tommy Mackenzie, Kevin Kidd, is not an addict but the violent and dangerous Begbie, Begbie, Robert Carlyle, is also off drugs and does not present a desirable alternative to a life of drug taking. Sick Boy, Jonny Lee Miller, and Spud Murphy, Ewen Bremner, are his two closest friends who are drug takers and they help each other support their habit. After relapsing with negative effects he is taken in by his reluctant parents and goes cold turkey to get off drugs after narrowly escaping a prison sentence. He is demoralized when he discovers that Mackenzie, who had experimented with drugs previously, has been diagnosed HIV positive and later dies. Begbie begins to drag all of his friends down as he continues to live a life of crime without letting anybody near him escape from his clutch. The friends decide to do a drug deal so that they will have enough money to start anew but this presents several problems for all of them.\n\nWhat the film gets right is that drug use is not all horror and sickness and feeling bad. There is a reason that people take drugs and this film displays why, for at least brief moments, being on drugs can be a positive experience and take you away from the boredom of everyday life. This group of friends do not want to live like their parents who have probably worked the same job all their lives and never touched illicit substances. In their own way they are free of the restrictions and expectations that society places on men who do try to achieve something with their lives beyond brief highs. None of them appear to have serious jobs and so they are free to discuss James Bond and wander around Edinburgh all day and night chewing the fact. Something about this is romantic as they hold on to the experiences of youth and childhood when there is nothing to do but enjoy yourself and yet when they have no money to pay for drugs and are reminded of their estrangement from their parents life becomes very hard indeed.\n\nEven when Renton descends into hell and has visions of a dead baby crawling on his ceiling the film retains a sense of humor. It's lowest and most painful point is Mackenzie's death as we see a young man with so much potential throw his life away on a drug that will not give him the lasting relief from his break up with his girlfriend that he needs. It is important that this is what pushes Renton to change as making us believe that his parents, who he would seem to have severed ties, are his inspiration for getting clean would have been a stretch. The fact that he changes because of the realization that he is a bad person and has let down a person that he actually cared for makes us want to see him succeed this time. We have come to sympathize with this man as hopeless as he is and do not want to see him destroy any potential he has by taking drugs. At the film's end we feel positive and assume that Renton will reform himself, I will not reveal why, but much like The Lost Weekend (1945) it is left up to us to decide whether our hero will actually manage to shake his crippling addiction.",

The chemistry and the conversations between the lead characters communicates fairly to the audience as it offers lots of mutual thing to connect easily.

And as far as execution is concerned, Danny Boyle has got it covered and has done some of his best work in here as a director. Ewan McGregor is convincing in his portrayal of a drug addict and is pretty much left to carry on the whole feature on his shoulder where he is supported decently by the cast.
