    "summary": "In a small and religious coastal town, a simple, devoutly religious Scottish woman, Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), finds a partner in an oil rig worker from Norway, Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsgard). However, the relationship grows strained when Nyman breaks his neck in a horrific work accident on the rig and becomes paralyzed. Unable to perform sexually and suffering mentally from the accident as well, Jan convinces Bess to have sex with other men, which she comes to believe is God's work.",

Half an hour later I was sitting on my bed with my mouth hanging open.  Watson is simply phenominal.  Excellent direction, casting, and editing too.  It's a very intense movie - not something you'd want to show for a jolly social event, but every bit worth watching.",

            "content": "\"Every woman here has to learn to be alone.\" Such is the matronly wisdom Bess (Emily Watson) receives from her mother (Sandra Voe), concerning their remote Scottish village's proximity to the oil rigs in the North Sea, which pull the men from their marriage beds for work like magnets. Bess is a \"feeble-minded\" twentysomething (I think?) year-old girl who marries a handsome Dane named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård). Everything is new to Bess, it seems, who possesses a childlike (but not –ish) approach to love, religion, and sex. However, Bess is presented with an unimaginable challenge when her newly betrothed is injured during a workplace accident, rendering him almost completely paralyzed from the neck down. What we get is not a \"feeble-minded\" young woman, but someone unbelievably strong and resolved in their love for their husband, even when that person presents them with, somehow, another gut-wrenching challenge. Jan wants Bess to sleep with other men and then share the experiences with him. I was surprised to find other reviewers (most notably Roger Ebert) describe this request as cruel. At first, I considered this a way for Jan to share some sexual connection with his wife while also permitting her to enjoy the physical pleasures that accompany sex. Much of the plot follows Bess as she juggles these excruciating challenges life has presented to her — she also speaks directly to God, who manifests himself through Bess in a paternal voice of succor. Watson creates a character in Bess that is special — I immediately want to see more of her movies. I was a little confused at the artsy \"chapter breaks,\" but came to love them. Where the film really ascends are the final few scenes. I mean, it's like one punch to the gut after another — only here can watching a previously paralyzed man walk appear merciless. Bess's final line, the funeral, those heavenly, heavenly bells, it's all so poignant and beautiful. I almost feel like I need to re-watch this very soon, something I rarely do, Breaking the Waves is a gorgeous movie and a must-watch.",

Set in a remote coastal town in Scotland, Bess (Emily Watson, who gives a tour-de-force performance) is a mentally challenged, deeply religious woman who falls in love with oil rig worker Jan (Stellan Skarsgard).  When he is seriously injured at work, Bess is devastated and begins a descent into a world of madness.  Breaking the Waves is an excellent example of von Trier's Dogme 95 school of filmmaking – handheld cameras, natural lighting, location shoots, etc.  The style will be unsettling for the uninitiated, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with a powerful, deeply moving film.",

            "content": "Lars' way of editing and filming is unique. He does these quick jump cuts during and between scenes that are very distinct to his movies. It's something you don't see in moves at all. It's definitely his own thing. Emily Watson is cute and charming. The movie seems to take place around what looks like the early 70's and Emily's character comes from a very religious and small Scottish community. The movie has a great sense of humor. Especially with the Americans at the wedding. The guy chugging the beer in the elders face and the one dude jumping on his friends back. It seems she married someone she loves but her elders don't approve of it since Jan is an outsider. So weird how she wanted to lose her virginity and have sex with Jan for the first time in a bathroom lol. \n\nEmily's character is very peculiar and unusual. It reminds me a little of her character in ‘Punch Drunk Love'. But she might be a little unstable and touched in the head in this movie. The Scottish countryside looks fucking gorgeous! So green, mountainy, modest and spacious. That church Bess goes to seems to be stuck in some very old conservative ways, like they're detached from the real world. Sort of gives off ‘Midnight Mass' vibes. And even more so being in a tiny community in the Scottish countryside. \n\nGod that's so tragic. Jan is completely paralyzed from the neck down. He's such a good person. It's one of those freak accidents that you don't really know why it happens to god people. Omg that scene where he tries to overdose on the pills. It's heartbreaking, he doesn't deserve what he's going through. I guess Bess in a way sort of represents a kind of virgin Mary character. Especially the way she communicates with God and seems to break the 4th wall every time she makes eye contact with the camera. She's very giving as well. \n\nWow. She jacked off an old man in the back of the bus… Lol wtf?! I can't believe how she started going around town dressed like a prostitute and is now fucking random guys because she thinks it will cure Jan. Wow, Bess sacrificed her life to save Jan's. Now he's walking with crutches and is mobile again. I'm glad Jan decided to take her body out of the coffin and instead of burying her, dumps her body in the ocean right next to the oil rig. Omg I love that ending with the church bells finally ringing - signaling that miracles exist and that Jan and Bess' love will live on forever. \n\nIn good Lars Von Trier fashion, this movie is controversial. Especially with its themes and questions it asks. Powerful performances from everyone. Stellan gives a beautifully heartbreaking performance and Emily gives probably one of the most powerfully emotional performances I've seen. The acting seems so candid and genuine. It feels like you're actually there with them just being in the moment. It's definitely a slow burn kind of movie. I kind of wish that Trier didn't use the yellowish brown-colored tone to the movie. It makes it look dreary and depressing striping it from all natural colors. I mean the movie is already sad and depressing, why are you going to visually hurt us as well? But I guess he was going for that whole early 70's look. Like the way pictures looked back then when you took them from a camera. \n\nFor being such a somber, depressing, tragic and dark movie, it's one of the most unexpectedly hilarious movies I've seen. It has its moments where you can't help but burst out laughing. I think this movie was Lars' way of giving rigid conservative religion the finger. Maybe not so much religion as a whole, but definitely the way the elders were running the church. Very detached from the world. Very unfun with no bells and very conservative stuck in their old ways. Not letting women speak during the sermon, believing they have the right to cast people to the pits of hell because they're sinners and also not having church bells. It's quite delusional really. The movie poses some really thought provoking questions as well. Like, do you think it was perverse of Jan to tell Bess to go out and have sex with other guys? I personally think Jan wasn't doing it out of perversion. Instead he was doing it out of love. He knew he couldn't perform and knew how much she enjoyed it, so he wanted her to move on and continue with her desires. With all that being said, I won't watch this movie again. It's too depressing, heartbreaking, tragic and yellow-looking. I don't like the lack of natural colors.",

            "content": "I'm still working on why I don't seem to connect with a lot of von Trier's films in the way that so many other people do, and I think that Breaking the Waves may have shed some light onto it. Right now, I'm thinking that the reason is because of the director's particular interpretation of 'weird'. You can have so many flavors of weird at the movies - delightful quirkiness, pure eccentricity, moderate silliness for comic relief. But von Trier constantly seems to return to weirdness based in pretension alone, the kind that sees Watson's Bess have random screaming fits, head down to the coast to throw her arms open to a roaring sea, and give back-and-forth dialogue where she literally talks to God. It's all very profound, has overt religious/self-sacrificial references and leaves plenty of opportunities for actors to demonstrate great physical range and tortured delivery, or so we are led to believe. But the Dogma 95 technique, with its deliberately grainy visuals, shaky-cam shooting style, and implied naturalistic feel, coupled with von Trier's \"look at me!\" sense of direction, has just never done it for me - it's original, but without much in the way of purpose. The biggest aspects that redeem this film are Watson's performance (she goes all-out, which is acceptable given the personality traits she is meant to embody) and the sense of character development, which is compelling given the range even if you are left wondering why certain decisions were made to take the story in the direction it goes.

There were obvious merits to the Dogme 95-esque filmmaking style but ultimately every facet just emphasized Emily and stripped away things that in a different director's hands would have obfuscated her performance. The plot itself felt unrealistic in that none of the characters were willing to listen to reason and their decisions didn't revolve around basic common sense, and in a few scenes the nudity came off as gratuitous, as though Lars was just getting the actors naked because he could rather than because the story really called for it or was improved by it. Still, I'm reviewing this after finishing his Golden Heart trilogy and found this to be the best movie of the lot, if only for Emily.",

While the film may have benefited from some editing to reduce its slightly distended running time, such a small quibble should by no means dissuade the prospective viewer from bearing witness to this most profound and subversive metaphysical statement by the inimitable Von Trier.",

            "content": "A tribute to love and misery from Lars von Trier.\n\nLars von Trier's romance drama Breaking the Waves (1996) is a depressing ode to the mentally ill and the tragically enamored. Trier's script gives a realistic sense of a woman in love with her husband no matter the cost. The tragedy of Breaking the Waves lies in her total devotion to her husband without the use of her own common sense. \n\nTrier brilliantly uses his grounded script to give commentary on many themes concerning real life, such as love, faith, perversion, marriage, infidelity, death, compassion, cruelty, handicaps, dejection, and mental illness. All these ideas wash into the ocean of emotional turmoil that is Breaking the Waves.\n\nLars von Trier's direction is a fantastic example of the Dogme 95 style of filmmaking that Trier himself invented alongside Thomas Vinterberg. Trier's use of a handheld camera keeps you in the moment of each scene. All the interactions feel genuine and immersive. Trier follows his actors closely all while replicating a documentary style radiating a sense of realism. Thus, Breaking the Waves looks like the events are actually happening.\n\nFurthermore, Breaking the Waves is mostly shot on location in Scotland, even though he had a few sets built for the film. All the props feel real that could be actually in these Scottish homes. Breaking the Waves features lovely natural lighting, genuine color, and in 35mm camera lens. I find Trier's use of a grainy filter fascinating as it makes you aware Breaking the Waves is an art film, but also gripping you with realistic appearance. Although, Trier uses a brisk 1970's rock soundtrack for title cards as chapter dividers, the remaining scenes only feature speaking without non-diegetic scoring. Lars von Trier really captures a riveting story of faith into miracles with a near magical realism for Breaking the Waves.\n\nBreaking the Waves will either captivate or repulse for its brazen eroticism and explicit sexuality that blends zealous religious faith with complete nudity and open sexuality. I think this aspect makes Breaking the Waves feel more sincere and groundbreaking, but it may repel other viewers. Do give it a chance because the sexual encounters do have a point in Breaking the Waves.\n\nI have to mention the magnificent Emily Watson as Bess McNeill. Her brave performance delivers stark dejection, saddening loneliness, fervent sexuality, devout faith, and shocking hysteria all in one outstanding role. Watson convinces you of her innocent purity with her affectionate eyes and tender body language. Her soft voice and incredible conversations with herself are enchanting and sorrowful. Watson never has to act again after such a sublime display of sympathetic acting in Breaking the Waves. Her female martyr drives a sense of naive fatalism that is countered by supporting cast, especially her chemistry with Katrin Cartlidge.\n\nSpeaking of whom, Katrin Cartlidge is mesmerizing as the mournful and protective Dodo McNeill. Her role as Bess' sister is affectionate and heartbreaking as much as Watson's. Cartlidge exudes a caring disposition hidden by a stern outer persona. She really impressed me with her considerate acting. Katrin is an exemplary actress.\n\nStellan Skarsgard gives a fabulous performance as Jan. His initial happy and kindly persona feel so genuine coming from the likable Skarsgard. This makes his dive into paralysis so hurtful and shocking. His acting near still and destroyed is astonishing in Breaking the Waves.\n\nLikewise, Jean-Marc Barr's funny and friendly role as Terry is excellent. Adrian Rawlins displays a poignant affection for Bess as Dr. Richardson. Sandra Voe is devastating as Bess' cold mother. Lastly, Udo Kier makes a chilling cameo as a sadistic sailor with a haunting performance. I'm always pleased to see Kier in a great film.\n\nOverall, Breaking the Waves is as emotionally harrowing and thematically challenging, but well worth the effort to watch it. Lars von Trier proves his directing prowess with Breaking the Waves by demonstrating engaging technical skill and displaying his cast's marvelous performances. Breaking the Waves will disturb, but not before holding your heart in Trier's clutches.",

Surprisingly there’s a new flaw. Each chapter of the story would linger on a scenery shot with a popular song playing in the background for a full minute. I don’t mind these chapter cards serving as small intermissions, but the song choices don’t seem to fit the style of the story. Would’ve worked better if it was just silence. Breaking The Waves is a great film, but no one of Lars’ best work. Not even one of my favorites.

Or so she thinks.\nWatson is mesmerising as the malleable, comfort-seeking psychotic at the film's heart - a lost, psychologically-challenged soul who is manipulated as much by herself and her beliefs as she is by the people around her. This is a girl who, for her, talking to God is a literal two-way conversation between her doubts and fears, and hopes and dreams. \nHer performance is breathtaking and her character is as challenging as it is chastising - we feel for her and fear her in equal measure as the film transitions from romance, through to tragedy, psychosexual chaos and jaded spirituality.\nUsing Watson's simple soul as a pure, human puppet, von Trier's taps into the very essence of love, hope and fear.",

While Lars von Trier would frequently feature psychologically damaged female protagonists in his subsequent films, Bess is by far his most developed and sympathetic character, and the ideal thematic vessel. At almost three hours, Breaking the Waves also goes by remarkably fast, thanks in large part to adept pacing, and filmmaking that's beautiful, observational and brutally honest.

I know some people will say \"Tyler, film is an art and should be valued as such.\" Okay, If the intent of your artwork was to make me dizzy, bored, and simultaneously disgusted for 2 and half hours then congratulations you did it. Please give me 2 1/2 hours of my life back please. Actually throw another 5 minutes on there for my blow-hardy review.",

After watching Breaking The Waves, I realised that my preconceived feelings towards the director were wrong.\n\nThe film tells the story of Bess and Jan, but follows Bess' perspective. I found the story to be very interesting as Bess is a fascinating character. Bess can seen by others as a mentally ill woman, who may show signs of delusions. But I saw it as a woman blindly devoting to her god and religion. True, I am a religious person but I don't have anything against different perspectives and values, so if one sees Bess in a different light, that is fine with me. Bess' connection with God may also be in her own way in replacing her missing father figure. The film's spiritual quality allows the film's intimate story to be bigger than what it is, sometimes goes to the point where our characters feel hopeless in creating decisions for themselves as everything may have been in control by a higher being.\n\nThe relationship between Bess and Jan was beautiful, it was executed in a way that felt real. Trier doesn't place a glossy polish on their romance as it would have just come off as artificial and manipulative. Trier showcase love as this raw emotion that can be manifested in many ways, and one of them is sex. Sex is valued differently with every person but Trier manages to have the audience understand what it means and it's importance to the film's characters. There are a couple of moments in the film's middle chapters that felt slow and lacking in any emotion; these scenes are instead more concerned in developing the characters.\n\nThe film uses a more documentary approach in it's shooting to give off this idea of a third person watching the couple's relationship and Bess' emotional development; like as if it was God watching and following this story. The camera constantly follows the action and moves very beautifully, due to it's wonderful use of lighting. The film doesn't contain a score and normally a film like this would have one as it would have elevated the film's emotions and ideas. But surprisingly it worked amazingly well without it and keeps our attention on the film's story and characters. The film does contain great songs from David Bowie, Ian Anderson, and Leonard Cohen that play during the beginning of chapters. The songs prepares us for what would the audience would be coming into.\n\nThe film's acting was wonderful with a standout performance from Emily Watson, who is just perfect as Bess. She creates this vulnerability and innocence that was needed for the film's emotional scenes. Stellan Skarsgard was also great in the film but he was overshadowed by Watson's performance. Skarsgard's acting, after the film's complication, was primarily found in his eyes and he succeeded in conveying the character's emotions and inner thoughts.\n\nBreaking The Waves is a great film that is carried by Watson's performance and Trier's wonderful direction.",

            "content": "This tragedy hit most of my emotional walls, meaning that all sorts of topics were confronted in this singular work: the sanctity of love, sex, life, faith, tradition, family, etc. What's so strange about Breaking the Waves is that it never feels like an Oscar baiting tearjerker. The editing is strange in what it cuts and how it cuts, every \"chapter\" introduction of the movie is like a JMW Turner painting moving in slow motion to 1970s rock, and there aren't any scenes of unquestionable baiting. Those alternative touches didn't disregard critical notice, of course, and beyond that, Breaking the Waves is a powerful drama. Central character Bess (Emily Watson) grew up in a small Scottish town where Christianity is followed in an utmost strict sense. The mindset of everyone in attendance to or the council of the church is that one's faith is always being tested, and one must use judgment to pass God's test. Before we see that in Emily Watson's character, this is perfectly illustrated at her opening wedding in said church with an outsider, Jan (Stellan Skarsgard). A friend and co-worker to Jan challenges one of the religious councilmen to a drinking contest. The friend drinks a whole can of beer, then the councilman drinks a whole glass of lemonade. The friend then crushes his empty can, thinking that he had bested the councilman. In a both amusing and disturbing turn of events, the councilman crushes the glass with his bare hand. We see the friend react, and then it cuts to a new scene. This is never directly addressed again, but the mentality of the town is so clear in one of the lightest moments of the movie. Bess and Jan are soon separated, and Bess sees every personal struggle as God testing her love for Jan. Bess is constantly aiming to prove her love by doing whatever will make Jan happy. This blind commitment to love that Emily Watson portrays so sharply may be why she was nominated for an Oscar. I could not bear certain scenes where she was physically suffering, but still smiled due to her faith in love. Everybody else in her life were ready to deny her, but Bess followed through her course until the very end. By the end, with the church bells of another town ringing (no bells were present at the orthodox one), I couldn't take in that optimism. The previous events of the movie devastated me. I could root for one character in one scene, and despise them in the next. Breaking the Waves excelled in twisting my emotions. I need to catch my breath.",

It's more like every variation or synonym of \"powerhouse\" emphasized times a thousand; a force of nature. Also, like a great piece of literature, \"Waves\" is a big movie -- 156 minutes, lucidly filmed, grainy. In other words, not easy on the eyes. That doesn't even scratch the movie's sexual explicitness, some of the most graphic and incredible ever put to film. Not to say von Trier uses it for purposes empty or lost. But is it exactly empowering to see the softhearted and unstable Bess (Emily Watson, in her Oscar-nominated feature debut) dole out increasingly brutal sexual favors to strangers for sake of, she believes, saving her oilman husband Jan (Stellan Skarsgaard) from a (literal and karma) coma?\n\n\"Breaking the Waves\" is a masterpiece. It's one of those films where, I'm not even sure what to make of it. It feels scripture, a religious parable you might find in some sacred text but that challenges both the authority and compassion of God. Watching this, it isn't told in a way that seems to doubt His existence, which is why it wouldn't be out of the question for \"Waves\" to be shown as part of a clerical curriculum of some sort. Set in the 1970s Scottish Highlands, an omnipresent power seems to be there, but man, is it ever silent. This movie feels so cold, so distant, but by the end, it seems to signal something, the foolishness of the elders of Bess' super-devout church, of man in general, I don't know. The ending could also mean hope, that people like Bess, whose only crime was being \"too good\" a person, are evidence of earthly powers; of miracles.\n\nSpeaking of the movie alone now, I found myself also wondering what happened to Emily Watson. But then before writing this, I guess I never realized what a fantastic career she's had. \"Gosford Park\", \"Punch-Drunk Love\", \"Synecdoche, New York\", even 2011's \"War Horse\". She lost the Oscar for \"Breaking the Waves\" to Frances McDormand in \"Fargo\". With Kristin Scott Thomas for \"The English Patient\" up that year, too, I don't know who I'd pick. Von Trier is an insane filmmaker and deserves his rank among the best still working today. That he went on to make movies that were good, let alone JUST AS GOOD as \"Breaking the Waves\" speaks to his mind-boggling talent. It's an epic, a must-see, a lyrical love song that, in showing us the ambiguity of the dark, is a gift of thought, poetry and power. Let it break you. Despite it all, it's a blessing.",

            "content": "\"Breaking the Waves\" is a 1996 romantic drama directed by Lars Von Trier.\n\nBess (Emily Watson) is a strong believer in god, she goes to church frequently and has long talks with him and answers herself as an angry god through her own voice. She marries a nice man named Jan (Stellan Skarsgård) and they express a great sexual desire for each other, but he soon is paralyzed in an accident. Bess prays for him to return, but then Jan convinces her that the only way he will walk again is if she finds another man to have sex with.\n\nIt made me realize what a great director Lars Von Trier is, he knows how to make characters feel painfully realistic, which makes his movies a lot more dramatic than others. The movie is equally uplifting and depressing, it deals with themes of faith and religion. Emily Watson's character is like a disney princess stuck in the real world, struggling to find the bright side of life.\n\nI loved the opening to the film, when Bess (Emily Watson) looks at the camera, its like she's asking us to judge her. Apart from that, the rock music was great, it gave me a relaxing feeling that \"Dancer in the Dark\" didn't, a moment to breath in the middle of all the chaos going on. The dialogue between Bess (Emily Watson) and god reminded me of Gollum talking to his other personality in \"The Lord of the Rings\", I wonder if this film influenced them somehow.\n\nI'd recommend it to people who enjoyed movies like \"Take Shelter\", \"Dancer in the Dark\", \"Leaving Las Vegas\", \"Closer\", or \"The Marriage of Maria Braun\".",

It's also a semi-Dogme 95 (it's breaking the \"location rule\" but that's about it).\n\nIt features some fantastic acting. Stellan is the man as always and Watson rule in her debut full lenght. She is doing an amazing part, she hypnotized me. Allways liked her looks in a way. She can look cute, average or like a wreck, but she is always so natural.\n\nThe film feels realistic, naturally. Slow pace and down to earyt stuff. It reminds me of a handful of other films, but Triers creativity and imagination makes it a totally unique piece. Loads of symbolism here as well. I also like the songs that come in at the introductions of each chapters. Sad, heart breaking stuff makes this a different love story. With very interesting characters you stay interested as you learn new things about them and seeing new sides from them severeal times. I feel it's a very long film. I needed breaks. It's worth it since it's gets better and better and the last 40 minutes are mind blowing.\n\nIn mye top five Trier films, probably top three.

Von Trier's characters, while interesting, are no less controversial and McNeill encapsulates this. She shows strength of conviction and independence but her character is underpinned and undone by a fierce loyalty and ultimately a reliance on her husband.

            "content": "Definately not what I was expecting from a film about Moses, but hey, Lars von Trier is nothing if not unconventional... or a little messed up in the head. Based on the title, this film really does sound like it could be either a Moses film or an Asian kung-fu film, but either way, both subject matters promise a really, really long film. Man, those Asians sure love their overlong action films, almost as much as Lars von Trier loves overlong, well, anything, with the obvious exception of extended traveling. I don't know what he's so worried about, because, I don't know about you guys, but if Emily Watson ever looks at me, I think that my ability to fear will peak, because she's got some crazy eyes. Okay, maybe they're not that freaky; in fact, in Waton's youth, those eyes were actually pretty pretty, but they're still so bizarrely distant that I pretty much was expecting her to, somewhere along the way in this film, end up in the water and high for some reason, so that her pupils would dilate and she really would break the waves, shark style. Hey, after a while of sitting through this film, you too will be hoping for a dumb shift in events like that, just so that something would happen. Oh well, jokes aside, this film's title is actually pretty amazing, and certainly better than the film itself, which isn't to say that this film isn't enjoyable, because it is ultimately a film reasonably worth sitting through, but boy, do you have to sit for a long while.\r\n\r\nAt just under 160 minutes, the film is certainly a lengthy watch, though as you would probably guess from the fact that this is a Lars von Trier film, that length isn't so much long as it is overlong. Well, sure enough, this film takes its sweet time, of which, it appears to have plenty, as much of the padding in this film is very considerable, with overdrawn scenes of nothingness and immense repetition being found, not here and there, but almost throughout the film, and it really slows down the film's momentum, if it had any to begin with. Lars von Trier isn't really a bad storyteller, though his methods are certainly flawed, especially with this film, as he tells the story very dryly, manipulating the immense looseness of the film to emphasize meditativeness, when really, it only emphasizes von Trier's limpness as a storyteller, thus creating a distance with the story flow, thus creating some sort of emotional distance. Von Trier takes a realist approach with this film, attempting to restrain considerable inspiration and tightness in his storytelling in order to plunge you deeper into this world on a deliberate and human level, when really, the film simply comes off as boring and rather arrogant, partially because the illusion of humanity through non-flashy storytelling is, well, a flawed and pretty pretentious method that can't work if you put minimal effort into storytelling, but also because the film's visual style is distinctly cinematic, seeing as how it's so distinctly amateur. Well, maybe Robby Müller's cinematography isn't so much amateur as much as it's overstylized to the point of being just plain pretty bad, as it attempts to give the film a faithfully cold realist look, only to end up giving the film a profoundly bland lack of color - made more glaring by sometimes too unsteady and messy photography staging - that just looks kind of unattractive and, certainly, expands the emotional distance. The film's storytelling methods are certainly unique, to a certain extent, yet they are also naturally flawed, and unless they're compensated for, they can ruin, if not just plain destroy a film, and sure enough, this film collapses as not simply underwhelming, but just plain boring, and that's death for certain films of this type. However, this film does not collapse to ruin, let alone to total destruction, for although it should be more inspired than it is and with less problematic storytelling methods, it ultimately pulls through the dullness and distancing to stand as a watchable film, messy though, it may be.\r\n\r\nEven if a film's execution of a strong story isn't as good as it should be, a strong story concept can go a long way, and while this film's story isn't terribly stellar, or even all that terribly original, it's still worthy and fascinating, with complexities and depth that may not go played up all that much by Lars von Trier, as director, but can be noticed enough within the film's concept to earn your attention, and by extension, your investment. Lars von Trier's under-inspired direction really does drag this film down considerably, yet would have dragged it down further were it not for the fact that the story upon which this film lazily focuses isn't tainted terribly by faulty execution, and is worthy enough for you to be hard pressed to not be a little bit interested. Where von Trier's storytelling could have brought this film to a downfall, the worthiness of the story leaves the final product to transcend almost to the point of decent, while what secures the final product's being above mediocre is, of course, the acting. Now, the performances aren't consistently sparkling, yet they are consistently impressive, with the leads having more than a few very high high spots in their engrossing performances. Stellan Skarsgård captures his Jan Nyman characters' initial down-to-earth good-heartedness with smooth, human charm, yet when tragedy strikes and changes Nyman's life forever and for the worse, Skarsgård crushes with an intense presence of anguish and uncertainty as he endures the impossible and ponders upon the unthinkable, thus leaving him to change into a different and more disturbed person, and while such a performance is mainly written to be rather restrained, when Skarsgård delivers, he cuts deep and leaves you fully locked into Nyman as a fully realized and struggling man. As for leading lady Emily Watson, for her debut role, she, on the other hand, is consistently presented material and consistent in not letting that go to waste, as her Bess McNeill is a disturbed but well-intentioned soul suffering from overwhelming fear and tainted by her own overwhelming affections, which she shall put to the test by placing herself through many self-destructive struggles and challenges, and watching Watson portray such a layered and disturbed character with such raw emotional intensity and believability truly is an experience that's both heartbreaking and rewarding. The film is so limp so frequently, to where it could never be bad, but not likely to be good either, yet what keeps this film from collapsing is the worthiness of its story and the engrossing intensity in the performances, particularly that of Emily Watson, whose heart-wrenching portrayal of a disturbed and perhaps - nay - decidedly too committed romantic carries this film and marked the debut of a strong talent who can help in making messy projects such as these to state of being generally worth the watch.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film is immensely overdrawn, with near-endless redundant and repetitious material dragging the film down, while Lars von Trier's overly steady, limp and even rather arrogant direction, combined with Robby Müller's overstylized and bland cinematography, dulls the film down and distances its emotional resonance, until the final product finds itself crawling along as underwhelming, though not to the point of eventually collapsing as anything less than decent, as a consistent degree of engagement value goes spawned from a worthy story, brought to life by a myriad of inspired performances, with Stellan Skarsgård delivering a mostly restrained but ultimately piercing performance, and a then-newcoming Emily Watson delivering a consistently powerful lead performance that makes for a strong debut and helps greatly in making \"Breaking the Waves\" (Man, that title is awesome) an ultimately watchable and generally engaging drama, regardless of its being tainted by its own ambitions.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Comme c'est tout de même Von Trier, il faut avouer que certaines scènes dérangeantes sont absolument hypnotisantes et que les dialogues sont emplis de contre-sens logiques qui incarnent le film et lui donnent une petite touche si absurde et si horrifiante à la fois qu'on reconnaît immédiatement la touche du réalisateur danois.\n\nDu côté du Danemark, il va de soi que [i]Breaking the Waves[/i] est assurément l'un des grands films qui ait eu la chance de faire un saut international à grande renommée.

People said the same thing about Dancer in the Dark, but the two are done in completely different ways. I wasn't as emotionally connected to Dancer in the Dark as I was to this. Dancer in the Dark was just depressing and annoying after all the shit the character went through for no good reason. In this, an extremely lovable character played brilliantly by Emily Watson, is putting herself through awful things to prove her love to God. Her husband, Jan, is another extremely lovable character played brilliantly by Stellan Skarsgard. These two are in love, and would do anything for each other. Bess is so determined to please Jan that she goes against every doubtful voice in her head to make him happy. THAT'S commitment. This is the best movie Lars Von Trier will ever make and it's because of two main reasons. One, the protagonist is never judged. Her mental stability is never the butt of a joke and her faith in God is never shown with irony. I truly believed that she believed, and I started to believe myself because of the second reason that makes this the best movie Lars Von Trier will ever make: Bess' faith is confirmed and rewarded in the end. After putting herself through hell to please her husband and God, she dies. The priests at the funeral say she went to hell. Her sister says they have no right to say something like that. Jan and his friends (also extremely lovable characters) give her a proper burial at sea, free of judgement from people who didn't know the whole story. Right when Jan starts crying, that's when I lost it. It was absolutely heartbreaking. But, in the end, when Heaven's bells are ringing out over the boat, it is clear that Bess did not go to hell, and our hope and faith is restored, much like hers. Brilliant ending, absolutely brilliant. And that's what separates it from other Lars Von Trier movies, which, compared to this, are just depressing pieces of exploitation. I cared about these characters. They were beautiful. And yes, Bess was beautiful and she was destroyed. On paper, that is an easy thing to do. But not in the way it's done here. Not when you constantly share her hope and her faith all along the way to ease the pain. And especially not when she was right all along.",

The main character is Bess played by Emily Watson. She does a fantastic job as a woman who is very in touch with her core feelings and those feeling propel all her actions. She is seen by her community as simple and mentally unstable. However, it becomes apparent that society has learned to dull and numb themselves to the rawest of emotions. Bess feels those emotions and acts on them, so when she shows  emotion, she appears unbalanced. However, I feel that she was the most stable and in touch with her deepest self and therefore was propelled to goodness.  She is deeply in love with her husband and this love is so great that nothing else matters. She can't find herself without her husband. Her husband gets injured and becomes severely disabled. He wants to kill himself because he can't sexually satisfy his wife. He asks Bess to sleep with other men and then tell him about it. This way, he will feel the experience and it is like the two of them being together. The church elders, her family and her doctor think that her husband is mentally manipulating her and she is so weak that she can't make the correct decision for herself. The audience feels Bess' thoughts and intentions and realizes that she is not crazy. I think that the connections that are made in her husbands brain to his body through her stories helps him to heal. There isn't another review that made this connection. Over time, her husband improves but the story has a tragic ending. This is a story of triumph for love and deep beliefs and makes a quiet mockery of strict organized Christianity and society's attitudes on hiding your emotions.",

The two other parts are \"The Idiots\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\" but this is the strongest of the three.\n Bess (Emily Watson) is a devout, church going,  innocent young woman living in a remote Scottish village in the 1970's. She possesses a real sweetness, warmth and affection but she's also not right in the head. She marries oil rig worker Jan (Stellan Skarsgard) and is unable to bear separation from him when he leaves for work.  When he is brought back from the rig paralysed after an accident, her obsession adds to his despair. They arrive at a bizarre arrangement; he urges her to take a lover, for his own sexual gratification and she interprets this as a spiritual mission.\n Von Trier shoots in a grainy, almost documentary like style (with help from respected cinematographer Robby Muller) adding to the realism of his story and his characters. Emily Watson (in her debut) is commanding throughout with a marvellous and brave performance. Her physical and mental struggle is tragically and achingly portrayed. Von Trier's films tend not to be easy viewing, or the treatment of his female characters, for that matter. Just look at the aforementioned films, as well as, \"Dogville\" and \"AntiChrist\". This is no exception and any actress taking on a role in his films needs to be committed. Watson certainly is here and commands the screen entirely. The only downside that the film suffers from, is it's length. After the two hour mark, and another half hour to go, it overstays it's welcome. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem but the subject matter is so depressing that it becomes an exhausting experience.\n Not to everyone's tastes but if your a fan of Von Trier, then it's essential viewing. But, as always, with the provocative director, it doesn't paint a pretty picture.",

Whereas Dancer in the Dark used a succession of farfetched circumstances to reach its end result, Breaking the Waves takes a much more natural course, which is the slow and painful breakdown of a marriage because of a life-changing accident. \n\nBess's demise is the result of her unwavering love for her husband, coupled with her unwavering faith in a God who does not answer her prayers. And religion seems to be one of the themes which the film attacked the most passionately. When Bess turns to her church for guidance, they reject her because women are not allowed to speak there. When Bess turns to her mother for guidance, she is ignored because the church has ordered anyone who knows Bess to act as though they do not. When she is followed about the town being stones by a group of children, she once again returns to the church, but is left unconscious by a priest who does nothing. Her last attempt to save her husband leads to her death, and at her funeral the church elders proclaim her a sinner and condemn her to death. \n\nBreaking the Waves is unrelenting in its emotional turmoil, enormously powerful in its ability to move, distress, and anger audiences, and better proof of the evils of religion I cannot think of.",

It looks like a film made in the Sixties or Seventies with it's muted colours (\"Get Carter\" sprang to mind)  when it looks like a film at all - it more closely resembles a kind of unflinching documentary, with no holds barred. You could say that the director's approach as a professional filmmaker was to disguise himself as an amateur.\r\n  It's immediately understood that Bess has problems, she's seen conversing with God in church and elsewhere (speaking his replies as well as her questions) in between bouts of emotional intensity which are at odds with the restrained religiosity of all around her. Her eccentricity spills over into obsessive love when she marries oil-rig worker Jan, who introduces her to the physical forms of love she's only imagined before.\r\n  He has a serious accident on his rig which almost kills him and leaves him as a bedridden quadriplegic: Bess blames herself, as her private channel to God has produced his early return in an unintended way. The real trouble starts when Jan convinces her that having sex with other men is the only way she can now please him physically, and he wants to hear about it afterwards.\r\n  Initially, she has problems complying with his manipulation of her, but she is tempted to go further as his prognosis improves, thinking that she is influencing his recovery. The villagers and church elders in her remote Scottish community certainly don't share this opinion, and try to either get her shunned by the community or sectioned.\r\n  She is fatally injured in her second trick as a full-blown prostitute, after visiting Udo Kier's ship and being subjected to his sadism. After her death, her friends (including Jan, who's now walking on crutches, is their something to her beliefs after all?) snatch her body from the morgue and bury her at sea to avoid the religious powers-that-be's condemnation of her in death as well as life.\r\n  I'm at a loss to think of who else could have played the role of Bess better than Emily Watson does, the demands on an actress in playing her are so intense that I don't think even Nat Portman would have considered it. She's TOTALLY believable in the part, and if anyone ever deserved an Oscar for a performance, it's her.",

I love how the narrative is told episodically in chapters and the weird interludes of pop-rock music.

This is presented in beautiful 35mm stock in order to get that home movie look that is perfect for all the close ups and hand held tactics. While this certainly is a great looking movie, it is not without incredible performances and unforgettable characters. Both Emily Watson and Stellan Skarsgard convince us in less than 10 minutes that they are truly and deeply in love, which is no easy feat. Then, they manage to give so much emotion and physicality (well, not Skarsgard obviously) to their respecting roles that the tragedy/love epic is as effective as intended. Von Trier's understanding of what it takes to capture a powerful performance while also keeping in mind the visual aesthetics is unmatched. It's as if everything was so meticulously casual that it becomes almost ridiculous to try and fathom how he gets some of the shots he does. I love the way this plays around with faith and religion. It manages to give criticism, but at the same time respect people's beliefs. Von Trier's work is so stylized and particular that I can see why he has his critics, but at the same time it's easy to see why so many people worship him.",

            "content": "3.5/4.0\r\nLars von Trier's \"Breaking the Waves\" is an examination of how religion should not be used to judge people's actions even if these actions seem utterly unacceptable. The movie is set in the 1970s at a strict Christian/Calvanist Scottish town. The men of God have power, women are not allowed to speak at church and bad people in life are condemned to hell during their burial. \r\nAt its core, the movie is a study of a very unique character. Bess McNeill (Emily Watson in her Oscar-nominated feature film debut) is a naïve woman who seems a little bit mentally challenged. Despite the apprehensions of her Christian community, she marries outsider, man-of-the-world Jan (Stellan Skarsgård) who is an oil rig worker. She is a good Christian who has done no wrong in her life. She has these consistent conversations with God for which she replies to herself as God's voice changing her voice to be a little more rugged. \r\nTold in von Trier's now-famous chapter/act format (with each chapter here opening to beautiful '70s pop rock anthems), the first part of the movie deals with the marriage from the wedding to most importantly their sex life. Bess was a virgin and she openly approaches sexuality. She first makes love to her husband in the washroom while the wedding is ongoing instead of opting for a more romantic first-time. It is as if sex liberates her senses but she remains the same naïve girl she was. Her husband leaves for work and she turns hysterical. He returns earlier than he should (she believes in answer to her prayers) but totally paralyzed from head to toe after a work-related accident. \r\nThey can't divorce (not that she wants to) and somehow her husband convinces her to have sex with other men and then recount the encounters to him. She believes by doing this she is curing him and as his condition worsens, she turns into a prostitute of sorts and gets immense scrutiny from her community including those dearest to her. The movie is littered with beautiful symbolism that reaches its epitome in the excellent and moving finale/epilogue that I will not reveal here. \r\nWatson is pitch-perfect in possibly one of the most important and memorable female roles in modern film history. She demonstrates an immense emotional range and gets every ounce of audience sympathy despite her acts. Katrin Cartlidge is very good as Dodo, Bess's sister-in-law nurse, the movie's sound of righteousness and possibly the only person who genuinely cares for and loves Bess. The movie's other righteous character is Adrian Rawlins (who is good but not equally memorable as Cartlidge) as Jan's doctor who is the subject of her first (failed) attempt for a sexual encounter. \r\nVon Trier's directs the movie mostly in his famous Dogme95 tradition (\"Breaking the Waves is actually his first mainstream effort in the tradition) with a great sense of realism aided by grainy, handheld video-cam/documentary-like cinematography by Robby Müller. The movie's main setback is that it over-stretches at times particularly in its first half but that does not undermine its status as one of the 1990s most important and memorable movies.",

Notice that the movies I compared this one to all came out after Breaking the Waves and that the movies I mentioned are incrdibly bleak and horrific (in a good way). Breaking the Waves is no different. \r\n\r\nIt starts out extremely happy. Some scenes feature the main stars Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love) and Stellan Skarsgard (the guy from Good Will Hunting that was always arguing with Robin Williams that wasn't named Matt Damon) smiling for the sake of just showing them smiling and being happy. But if you look over the plot description, you will know that those scenes are just softening you up for the kill. The second half of the movie is a dark psychological character study that often gets disturbing and heart-wrenching. \r\n\r\nThis is a really overlooked film that doesn't get a lot of the attention it deserves, which is surprising since it is from the self-proclaimed \"biggest director in the world\" Lars von Trier. It's the first movie I've seen from him and his visual style can be best described as a combination of Paul Greengrass-esque handheld camera shots and the quick editing style of British films. \r\n\r\nEmily Watson's leading performance was brave and gutsy. She was rightfully nominated for a Best Leading Actress Oscar in 1996. Obviously Frances McDormand won that year and I don't even think that that performance was a leading role, but that's a whole other story. I just looked at the cast for this movie and there's a guy named Jean-Marc Barr...kind of like that weirdo John Mark Carr haha. \r\n\r\nAnother thing I liked about this movie was the chapter segments. I liked the titles, cinematography, and classic rock songs between the chapters. The film itself is an intelligent meditation on the old phrase \"You get what you wish for\", religion, the role of women, assisted suicide, love, and addiction. The movie gets progressively darker as the run time progresses, but I still found it to have good entertainment value. The movie also has a cool title. \r\n\r\nThe ending is surprisingly uplifting and kind of nifty. Breaking the Waves was quite an experience.",

Notice that the movies I compared this one to all came out after Breaking the Waves and that the movies I mentioned are incrdibly bleak and horrific (in a good way). Breaking the Waves is no different. It starts out extremely happy. Some scenes feature the main stars Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love) and Stellan Skarsgard (the guy from Good Will Hunting that was always arguing with Robin Williams that wasn't named Matt Damon) smiling for the sake of just showing them smiling and being happy. But if you look over the plot description, you will know that those scenes are just softening you up for the kill. The second half of the movie is a dark psychological character study that often gets disturbing and heart-wrenching. This is a really overlooked film that doesn't get a lot of the attention it deserves, which is surprising since it is from the self-proclaimed \"biggest director in the world\" Lars von Trier. It's the first movie I've seen from him and his visual style can be best described as a combination of Paul Greengrass-esque handheld camera shots and the quick editing style of British films. Emily Watson's leading performance was brave and gutsy. She was rightfully nominated for a Best Leading Actress Oscar in 1996. Obviously Frances McDormand won that year and I don't even think that that performance was a leading role, but that's a whole other story. I just looked at the cast for this movie and there's a guy named Jean-Marc Barr...kind of like that weirdo John Mark Carr haha. Another thing I liked about this movie was the chapter segments. I liked the titles, cinematography, and classic rock songs between the chapters. The film itself is an intelligent meditation on the old phrase \"You get what you wish for\", religion, the role of women, assisted suicide, love, and addiction. The movie gets progressively darker as the run time progresses, but I still found it to have good entertainment value. The movie also has a cool title. The ending is surprisingly uplifting and kind of nifty. Breaking the Waves was quite an experience.",

Shot only with available light on cheap, grainy filmstock and with music only during the brief minute-long chapter breaks, Breaking the Waves is a powerful exploration of love, identity, social norms, and--most importantly--the power of faith. Like many of Lars von Trier's films, Breaking the Waves probably is most famous for being transgressive; that is, it features elements of sexuality or violence that are deemed inappropriate by the majority body of the flim critc circle. Breaking the Waves isn a flim as naked as the scenes within it--it is a film that strips people down to their emotional core. Consequently, it is a harrowingly beautiful deconstruction of all the best and worst things that make us human: love is paired with servitude, faith is paired with naivety, etc. Its love story of a man who becomes paralyzed and a woman who sleeps with other men to meet his demands becomes an existential fable about the nature of our relationships with other people and the possibility of true love. Emily Watson's performance is so brilliant that books could be written about it, and the film ultimately leaves us in an ambiguous position to determine whether or not our faiths are valid or not. Breaking the Waves once again proves that von Trier is a master filmmaker and storyteller who has the power to equally take us to other worlds or force us to reconsider our own.",

This is exactly why he gets accused of being misogynistic, but I donâ(TM)t care what people say, I think he makes great, sledge-hammer-to-the-heart movies.

It was literally painful watching her throughout this film. The rest of the cast kept up for sure, but Watson was above and beyond everyone else on screen easily. The photography in this movie was also absolutely beautiful, and I felt the film benefited overall from the Dogma style camera work.\r\n\r\nNow onto the controversy that seems to surround everything Lars Von Trear does. As far as accusations of misogyny go, I really don't agree in any of his films I have seen so far. I am starting to notice a common pattern, however, in that in most of his films the female lead is almost always naive, to the point of being incredibly clueless and borderline stupid. Still though his leading female characters always have hearts of gold and are ultimately the victims of cruel, arrogant, opertunistic men. Accusations of misanthropy would make much more sense to me as almost none of the characters in Von Trears films are ever both kind hearted and smart or powerful. Thats not to say there arent likeable characters in his films, just none of them are ever the usual perfect specimens that most hollywood films rely on for their protagonists. \r\n\r\nI saw this movie more as an attack against organized religion and the herd mentality it instills on its followers. I'm not going to give the ending away but Jesus would have understood that Bess was following the righteous path of love, despite putting herself through Hell to do such. Yes, this movie is difficult to watch at times and its not going to be for everybody, but if you want to watch an emotionally powerful film, that is also extremely challenging and complex, then I would strongly recommend this.",

The childlike Watson marries her true love (Skarsgard), and she quickly learns about sex and physically expressing her love. We learn she is slightly schizophrenic, but completely good and harmless nonetheless. Skarsgard, who works on an oil rig, ends up having an accident that leaves him paralyzed. Now unable to physically love his wife, he makes an odd request: he asks that she have sex with other men, and tell him about the encounters so he can feel a part of the experience. Though at first repulsed by the notion, Watson prays and deduces that it is Skarsgard's love for her that will help him get better, and she should do as he asks. As the people in her small religious town catch wind of her escapades, she becomes an outcast from both her church and her family.\r\nWriter-director Lars von Trier infuses the film with potent themes of faith and love. Careful attention is paid to the camera focusing, sepia-tinting, and textural overlays, but the two and a half hour film lacks any sense of pace - it is far too much of a good thing. His choice to use only hand-held cameras creates a wobbly frame of reference that will make you seasick. (No fooling - I had a headache and an upset stomach by the time the film was over.) I can certainly recommend Breaking the Waves for those who like a good slow movie. Just be sure to bring your Dramamine along. Queer Quotient: The nudity in the film is treated very matter-of-factly, such as scenes in which Skarsgard and his rig buddies hang out in the shower and frolic naked. The odd thing is that even with Watson's sexy scenes, there's more male nudity than there is female nudity. I don't have a problem with that.",

His way of filming, with handhelds, give the raw emotional story a home video feel and makes it feel as personal as possible, bringing us painfully close to the characters; his feelings towards clear focus within shots are something I do not agree with, but I think I can understand his vision here.  \nEmily Watson is so beautiful, so convincing within her role as Bess.  She is heartbreaking and honest and to watch her is a pleasure.  We come to learn that Bess has been declared to a hospital before for mental trouble and Watson plays a perfect line of that with a mix of naivete and childlike qualities, never truly revealing the truth behind this woman's character, but letting us figure it out.   She 's convincing in the big moments, but more importantly in the small moments and gripped me there first.  She more than deserved her Oscar nomination.  \nI think it's interesting to look at Bess as almost a Christ-figure, or at least an instrument of God (the last scene, of which I still don't know how I feel, proves this), of sacrificial love.  \nWithin her story, von Trier condemns the church to being the Pharisees even so much as seeing her laying unconscious out their door and passing her by.  von Trier is pointing to the fact that this is the kind of person God would rather be with than any self-righteous prude that sits in a church pew.  We never really come to understand Jan's odd and cruel request of his Bess (we're not supposed to), but we understand that she wants to fulfill it and that is exactly what she sets out to do.  She believes she can save him and God honors that more than following his rules by the book.\nThe chapter title shots with their music strike a strange chord with me.  Having seen other work of von Trier's I am more accepting of them, but on a first-time viewing, I would absolutely balk.  He loves polar opposites, the dichotomy of it all and these choices exemplify that.\nI can't say it's a film I want to watch again, but I appreciate it for von Trier's passionate story and characters and his great depth of themes.",

Watson's character Bess has strong religious beliefs, and is also just a little bit...insane? Her desperation to do whatever it takes to keep her husband alive seems an all too deliberate chance for Von Trier to pick on women...just like in 'Antichrist' - women cannot be trusted and therefore must either be mad enough to cut off their lady parts, or mad enough to go around humping random men to keep their husband alive.\r\nStill, much respect for Von Trier as the aesthetics of the film are quite impressive in parts, and the handheld camera technique he prefers works surprisingly well. However, it takes a bit too long for the film to kick into the main plot, spending a little too much time on character development. This film left no impact on me whatsoever, which is a shame.

Katrin Cartlidge, excellent as usual, plays the sole mouthpiece of reason. Emily Watson acts flawlessly, but long-suffering little Bess is just a case study in how to spin one's parasitic selfishness, masochism and idiocy into misunderstood martyrdom. The problem isn't so much that the townsfolk conclude that \"Bess was good\", it's that Von Trier seems to agree with them whole-heartedly. But administering handjobs to strangers on the bus really doesn't make her Joan of Arc, even if she has the IQ of Forrest Gump, and by the end of the film, she had shed enough tears for herself that I felt no need to join in.",

Natuurlijk, het is een gek wijf (zoals wel meer vrouwen in de films van Lars von Trier), maar de ordening die mensen in het leven aanbrengen is niet altijd even makkelijk. Al helemaal niet als er mensen doodgaan, de kunst is aanpassen en afwachten. \nDe sfeer deed me af en toe denken aan La Pianiste, maar op het platteland en niet in de stad. Hoofdstukken aanbrengen hinderen mij doorgaans niet. Deze keer echter braken de beelden met de sfeer en vond ik ze niet mooi. Ook het einde is wat over de top en zorgt ervoor dat het verhaal te goed samenvalt, bij Antichrist stoorde ik me daar aanzienlijk minder aan.\nDesalniettemin verdient de film hoge waardering voor de psychologische tinten, fraaie winderige beelden en het acteerwerk van Emily Watson.",

Shot only with available light on cheap, grainy filmstock and with music only during the brief minute-long chapter breaks, Breaking the Waves is a powerful exploration of love, identity, social norms, and--most importantly--the power of faith.  Like many of Lars von Trier's films, Breaking the Waves probably is most famous for being transgressive; that is, it features elements of sexuality or violence that are deemed inappropriate by the majority body of the  flim critc circle.  Breaking the Waves isn a flim as naked as the scenes within it--it is a film that strips people down to their emotional core.  Consequently, it is a harrowingly beautiful deconstruction of all the best and worst things that make us human: love is paired with servitude, faith is paired with naivety, etc.  Its love story of a man who becomes paralyzed and a woman who sleeps with other men to meet his demands becomes an existential fable about the nature of our relationships with other people and the possibility of true love.  Emily Watson's performance is so brilliant that books could be written about it, and the film ultimately leaves us in an ambiguous position to determine whether or not our faiths are valid or not.  Breaking the Waves once again proves that von Trier is a master filmmaker and storyteller who has the power to equally take us to other worlds or force us to reconsider our own.",

While it is a soul-crushing throughout its duration, and it occasionally threatens to overstep its bounds and become offensive, one can not help but be in awe of the brutal honesty and graphic depiction of a marriage on the rocks Lars von Trier brings to the screen. Not only is it a romantic-drama, it also has a philosophical spin on the nature of religion and how the negative, secluded sections of the religious folk can be some of the worst human beings possible. It is anti-religious, but it is never an illustration of the norm of religious people. It is moreso a frank, disturbing look of a woman who needs help but the very people she turns to forsake her for their own selfish desires. Emily Watson's unforgettable, powerful performance drives this moving all the way to it's discouraging conclusion. It may not be easy to get through given its length and subject, but the way von Trier shoots this thing (with a handheld camera to capture a grainy feel), as well as his handle on the material is something to be in awe of.",
