Of course it's awful, but it's also so bad it's entertaining. \"You can have $25,000 for your goddamn fried chicken\" is one of the greatest lines ever uttered in a film. Forget \"Rosebud\" it's all about the fried chicken in this nonsensical thriller that never makes sense. While the plot about two women plotting to kill a man who has wronged them both, killing him, and then a mysterious stranger sending blackmail is intriguing, the plot itself is a jumbled, hilariously bad mess. When the plot twists come, you'll be scratching your head and then realizing that none of it makes any sense and very little is explained. Diabolique is a film I would only only recommend to B-movie fans because it works terrifically as an unintentional comedy. But if you're looking for a serious thriller, you won't find it here.",

It's a thriller about the triangle of an abusive school master and his submissive wife and his seductive mistress.  You think you know what's going on when murderous plots get hatched, but then things start to go differently and you realize there's more to the story.  It's a devilish plot that is sure to entertain.  The acting by Chazz Palminteri, Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone is excellent and the supense is delicious.",

I thought the French original was quite farcical, hammed up in places and wasn't quite as clever as it seemed at first glance. This US version is actually better in some ways, but worse in others. Something about the pacing leaves the viewer less than compelled, the script is probably slightly lame too. The acting is pretty good, the cinematography/setting/ambience is probably slightly better, the neighbours who help carry the wicker chest are much less irritating, the ending is much better. If you don't go in for old b&w foreign films with subtitles, this isn't a bad alternative.",
