    "summary": "A genie named Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal) has been sealed up for thousands of years, until one day he is accidentally freed by Max (Francis Capra), who is on the run from a local gang. Kazaam explains to the youth that he belongs to Max until he grants three wishes, but what Max really wants is to get to know his estranged father. When the genie, who considers trying his hand at a music career, forgets about his young master, Max is attacked by villainous club owner Malik (Marshall Manesh).",

            "content": "Well, adolescent really(19). Like Howard the Duck, Kazaam was a movie I loved as a child but looking back on it I was shocked at how low my taste buds were as a kid. Granted, there are some funny moments specifically the ones with the flying toasts and the bicycle race. And it is not the worst movie of 1996, Ed and especially Bio Dome are worse. However, the special effects are really quite substandard, and the rest of the production values are of direct to video quality and shoddy ones at that. The story is predictable with only a few worthwhile scenes to favour, the sight gags suffer from poor comic timing and the script is childish and simplistic. The characters I really dislike here, the kid is annoying, the villain is one of the lamest I have seen in a long time while Shaquille O'Neal's Genie with his awful rapping(then again I dislike rap intensely, and that is the least problematic of his performance) grated on me fast. The acting doesn't fare much better either, while the direction is literally non-existent and the soundtrack is only tolerable if on mute. This is of course my opinion, disagree all you want, I guess I just didn't like it. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

The editing & pacing are equally awful with things just happening and when there is any focus its marred by terrible special effects and a hilariously bad plot.

This movie has a reputation for being a great example of a bad movie, and it lives up to that reputation. Shaq may not be the best actor, but he has better acting examples under his belt than this movie. I think the writing is the biggest problem in this film, the audience can't connect with the characters as they are all introduced as self-serving and stuck up. The only character in the movie I felt for was Max's mother, played by Ally Walker. About halfway through the film, the movie seemed to become a cheap attempt to further Shaq's rap career, but he isn't a good rapper and none of the musicians he performs with are really any good either. The ending could have been satisfying if they had properly set it up earlier in the movie. Overall this movie seemed to be a cheap money grab using Shaq's name as the draw. Make a hard pass on this movie!",

However the problem I see in this film is not much more is developed with the other characters to make me care about them. The parents I don‚Äôt have much sympathy for either. Both sides show that they are flawed characters. There is also not much time we see them with their parents before they leave the parents out of the scene. Their is not enough back story provided concerning why the parents got separated. The bad guys and the gangs are not well developed either. This film has funny scenes such as the French toast flying around. Kazaam taking a shower but no water touching the floor. The film works best when Kazaam & Max are paired up. But there is not enough time to get invested in the other characters to care which side to stand for or against. This has so early visual effects which look cartoony rather than real such as Kazaam with magic sparks coming out flying around the room that looked false. I thought one of the odd visual effects was turning one of the villains into a ball. ",

He is voiced by the series' creator, Seth MacFarlane, and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the Griffin family, in the 15-minute pilot pitch of Family Guy on December 20, 1998. Peter was created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the Fox Broadcasting Company based on Larry & Steve, a short made by MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, the Griffin family appeared in the episode \"Death Has a Shadow\".",

The inimitable yet often misunderstood \"Shaq\" stars in this film travesty as a genie who gives a picked-on boy three wishes. Well my three wishes are: 1) That the United Nations bans Shaq from ever stepping in front of a camera anywhere on Earth ever again, 2) That every athletic contract include a clause preventing athletes from pursuing film careers, and 3) That Lena gets a lifetime Grammy, it's long overdue. And so you're producing \"Kazaam\" and you get a giant acting novice to star, so who do you hire to direct, to help bring forth what you hope will be a good performance from this lumbering jackass? Starsky! F*cking Starsky! Yes, '70s TV icon Paul Michael Glaser directs. And just to top things off, they throw in a cameo by boyband the Backdoor Boys...er, I mean the Backstreet Boys.

I expected Kazaam to be bad, but I wanted bad comedy rather than bad drama.\nKazaam is too gritty and crime based to be a kids movie, too childish to be entertaining for anyone else. \nIt also features cheap-ass visuals, Incredibly fast pacing, ridiculous plot dynamics and a distinct lack of creativity, which I feel can largely be attributed to the poor direction given by Paul Michael Glaser.\nObviously Shaquille O'Neal cannot act for crap, but his role as a cult figure and hilarious commoditization is what makes him ideal for the role of Kazaam, and rarely there's a small laugh to be had.\nBut with Kazaam, the screenplay was probably written by a 5 year old who's watched every Disney movie and attempted to fuse the moral lessons with a  loose rehash of the plot from Enemy of the State.\nThe cinematography is poor, as is the film editing and the ending with the final wish is was too illogical which is ironic because it's a movie about a rapping genie.\n\nThe few minor positives are that it's funny to say that you've actually seen this film because of the idea behind it, as well as a somewhat decent performance from young Francis Capra despite being stuck with awful material.\nI guess i also enjoyed the uplifting ending, but it does nothing to change the poor quality of Kazaam one iota.",

Well for one, if this was supposed to be an entertaining and fun family film, it definitely doesn't do that. Kazaam is a stupid, pointless, poorly constructed piece of garbage that should never have been made in the first place. This is a film that no one should waste their time on. Director Paul Michael Glaser should be ashamed of himself for directing this drivel. Kazaam is a pointless film, and if you're looking for one of the worst films ever made, then look no further. The acting is awful, the plot is equally bad and so is the directing. There is no redeeming qualities about this film and it's overall, a great waste of time. Watching paint dry is more entertaining than watching this trash. A terrible film that should never have been made, Kazaam definitely scraps the bottom of the barrel of bad ideas, and has nothing good going for it.

Boy do I feel sorry for my former childhood because I saw a whole heaping pile of crappy movies when I was young. If you're lucky enough to not have seen this movie then you are in for a real ride through hell if you decide to do so. That's what I had to experience when I watched it again, and I could barely tie my arms down to prevent me from scratching my eyes while they were in pain. Its movies like this that should never be made, but for some reason Hollywood keeps on making them. Why? Don't ask me, I'm not a mind reader (that is, if they have minds).\r\n\r\nThe movie fails to satisfy anyone who sees it, unless you're David Armstrong that is. Shaq has got to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, but I can't really say that because of one tiny problem: he's a BASKETBALL PLAYER, not an ACTOR. The plot doesn't make any sense and fails to give anyone a feeling of interest or excitement. The mere fact that it is irrefutably impossible for something like this to happen helps to make that statement more accurate. There's a reason we don't see Shaq in movies anymore, and this is without a doubt one of them. Don't see this movie unless you feel that you have to see how bad it is, but be sure to wear goggles so that you don't end up doing what I almost did. \r\n\r\nP.S.- for those of you who are asking me if I've seen the Nostalgia Critic review of this film then I'll say yes, and it was funny. ‚ò∫",

While he's singing, one of the lyrics is, \"let's Green Eggs and Ham it\". That's like a five year old writing a rap song. Second, Max is annoying and the villain is just a wannabe bad guy with thick eyebrows. Third, is this movie about slavery? Because in one scene, Max owns Kazaam after he uses up his last two wishes.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is just awful. If you're looking for a good movie with a genie, Watch Disney's, \"Aladdin\". That movie has a Genie that can sing and make people laugh. He's also voiced by Robin Williams. A \"GOOD\" actor.\r\n\r\n1/5",

            "content": "Actually when I saw for the first time this movie I was very young in age and I remember that was one of the worst  movies I had ever seen,was crappy,with bad actors and a script for crying.This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to stick to sports.I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie,but almost everything  about this film is horrible.The characters are either unlikable or stupid,the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialog is a joke,and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem.Hell,even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke.I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time.I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time.Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws.\r\n\r\nBetween the awful acting,the terrible script and the lousy effects,this movie is just plain bad.This is how bad this is,Shaq literally slam dunks the villain to defeat him! If that's not a plug in for his career,I don't know what is. The kid Max has no likable qualities,he has a very loving mother and a possible step father who cares for him, yet he acts like a total jerk because he's not getting his way with not having his dad around who is a criminal no less! Even when his criminal father kicks him out of his life, Max still does everything to save him,sick isn't it? Shaq, I don't know the writers were thinking.Maybe that it's so funny that a giant basketball super star should be a genie and it's a great way to make a quick buck for those sucker parents who's kids are begging to see the film.I don't know how to say this other than just say it,it really is as bad as everyone says it is if not worse.Trust me,don't waste your sanity on this horrible movie,Shaq's acting is enough to make you wish this movie never existed in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school.This kid is somehow 'misunderstood' and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is,by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown.Eventually,while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him,the genie Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes.But,the kid doesn't believe him and the genie's magic seems a tad rusty.\r\n\r\nEventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real. However,unlike most kids,he withholds making his wishes so, in the meantime,Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere - like his own personal servant.And, according to the clich√©,you know that by the end of the film, Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed.Oh,and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fianc√©.Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.\r\n\r\nOverall,it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane.Yes,folks,with a messed up message,bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters,this is one wretched film.Sadly,given the idea and actors,it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse.The only positive thing about this movie is that reminds me my childhood!!!",

            "content": "This movie really annoyed me. The kid (Francis Capra) is a little brat who spends most of his time on screen acting like a smart-ass and antagonizing everyone he comes across, including the audience. He also tries to establish a relationship with his father, who is involved in organized crime and yet Max still feels he is a viable alternative to his mother (Ally Walker) and his would-be step-father (John Costelloe), who are not that bad. Did I mention he is also stupid? As for Shaq...well...let's just say he is better on the court (well, in his prime anyway) than onscreen. His performance comes off as silly and awkward, though to be fair he does seem to have fun in the role. The two characters do not get along well during any point of the film with the exception of the end (which is kind of required) and in the middle when they engage in a god-awful rap duet, which is one of unfortunately many dumb scenes throughout the picture.\n\nThe worst part about this movie, even more from the performances, is that it does not really make sense. It is supposedly aimed at kids but it spends a lot of time focused on a bunch of criminals and people hanging around clubs. Were the filmmakers trying to bring in Shaq's older fans? I am not sure but whatever they were trying to do, they failed. It is a little odd to be putting that in a film that also features the basketball player riding around on a magical bicycle and making junk food fall down from the sky. As a result, it makes you lose focus on the plot and gives you less reason to about what happens next. It is not helped by a number of plot holes. I will not mention all of them, but here is one example: a stereotypical Middle-Eastern crime lord (Philip Santella) knows all about Kaazam's powers and limitations despite having very the little knowledge about him. Maybe he knows about genies based upon what he learned in his homeland, but we will never know.\n\nWell, there is nothing else I can really say except...the film sucks and I do not recommend it.",

He's funny to watch because you can tell he feels like an ass for being in the movie, and it shows on the screen. \r\n\r\nThe plot for this movie is as stupid as the poster. Long story short, rapping genie teaches kid how to not be a prick to his mom. The End. The plot stinks, the characters are bland and uninspired, and the musical numbers are torturously bad, but it's the fact that the movie is supposed to be taking seriously that makes it so awful. \r\n\r\nMy memory of this movie was indeed better than the movie itself, and I wish I had let this movie remain a good memory, instead of it becoming more pent up rage.
