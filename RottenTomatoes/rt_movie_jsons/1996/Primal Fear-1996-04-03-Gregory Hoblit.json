His latest case involves an altar boy, accused of brutally murdering the archbishop of Chicago. Vail finds himself up against his ex-pupil and ex-lover, but as the case progresses and the Church's dark secrets are revealed, Vail finds that what appeared a simple case takes on a darker, more dangerous aspect.",

The film's 130 minute running time uses it's time effectively and is even-paced between drama and action and never lingers in it's screenplay and is entertaining and passes the time quickly while remaining engaging. It should be noted though that the film includes some grissly images of the murder that takes place in the beginning and heavy language in places but never let's that compensate for the well written script.",

While I did find it a little bit uneven, some scenes being more captivating than others, which is why I do find it a little bit overrated, it benefits from a terrific cast and when the writing is good, it really is good. \nRichard Gene was good at playing an arrogant lawyer, and Laura Linney also delivers a strong and very convincing performance. But the actor who really made an impression on me was the young Edward Norton. This was his very first role in a film, and he is very good at it. I was quite impressed, no wonder he was later propelled to a great career after this movie. \nWhat I also liked about Primal Fear is that it delivers one twist which opens your eyes during the first half of the film, and then it drops a jaw-dropping plot twist on you in the end. It really stayed with me for a while. \nOverall, I'd say that this is a classic of the legal film genre, it's a good and interesting movie, which tackles the theme of appearances. Recommended !!",

The murderer's crimes are horrible and I suppose unforgiveable, but for some reason, I just was glad he got off with the murders in order to thwart the attorneys.\nI really didn't know what to expect as the plot kept twisting and turning, but I enjoyed the ending so much.

With one of the best (and most well-known) twists in film history, Norton solidified his dramatic acting chops with his versatile, unhinged turn as the altar boy turned gruesome murderer. Richard Gere's hotshot personality is pushed to the limit as an open and shut case gets thrown wide open once Norton's deception comes into play. Besides Norton's magnetic performance, the film is a pretty typical by-the-numbers legal drama that includes a solid ensemble, decent directing, and a good, if not too melodramatic, score. What truly elevates this movie above a typical legal drama is the compelling and unique narrative that culminates in an epic, unexpected turn of events that leads the viewer to question key moments in the film. Overall, a definite must-watch for aspiring lawyers and fans of legal dramas but also an essential for fans of great twist endings.",

The set up of this movie is pretty damn good. Edward Norton shine in this break out debut film role. I really don't like Gere's character so much, but I feel like at then I'll end up liking his character. He seems full of himself and cares too much about his image as a defense attorney. \n\nThe whole relationship and interactions between Gere's and Linney's character is entertaining and interesting to watch. They make good co stars. There's something about Frances McDormand that's always so charming to watch. I like her. \n\nHoly shit that look he gives Frances' character when she asks him, \"Hey, you know what I can do with this camera?\" and his response, was so goddamn cold and sinister. It was at this moment that I knew he was not mentally stable and he might have done it. \n\nThis is one of those movies where as the story and plot progresses, it gets better and better as everything comes to fruition and unfolds. Norton's acting was brilliant in this movie. You can't help but feel somewhat sorry for his character. Holy shit that ending was so fucking good. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, they throw this curveball at the end that completely changes everything. It's pretty dark but genius the way they did it. It's so crazy because right when Vail thought that what he was doing was a good deed and helping an innocent person, everything just got flipped around. This is what makes it dark as well because the whole reason why Vail got into being a defense attorney to begin with was to help out people who he thought we're good and had just did something bad but it ends up not being the truth. He believed that everybody was good and just got themselves in a predicament that made them do something bad. He was used. \n\nWell written and the acting is absolute top notch stuff especially from Edward Norton. Really great drama crime courtroom movie with an interesting and insane premise and an even more insane ending. This movie shook me pretty good.",

            "content": "I was rooting for everyone except for the newcomer and then Norton started taking charge of the energy in the room.\n\nPrimal Fear\n\nHoblit makes an excellent courtroom drama. Surprisingly, none of his films ever contributed anything new to that genre. In fact, I am just gonna come out and say it, it never even delivered what is already out there, well and established. A film that is so textbook and standard in its approach towards the characters and their arcs and their characteristics, you'd hope for it to at least gift you what you expect. The director Gregory Holbit doesn't throw such parties. His parties are a celebration. Celebrations that are completely misinterpreted and misunderstood, in what makes a celebration.. well, a celebration- I cannot stop using the word, celebration.\n\nSo how does a best selling novel, trending set of genre and an incredible cast prints a messy product out in the market? The answer is the laziness. Take the encounter of Frances McDormand and Laura Linney in the courtroom, later in the film. What should have been a hair pulling and nail biting scene, is instead played like a sloppy exhaustion of some labour work. The makers understands that antic smartly.\n\nBut never thinks of earning that moment in any dimension. It is enjoying too much with its sassy attitude, gloating for that undeserved achievement- at least that is what comes off in the end- to ever cast an impact. Which by the way, also turns out to be the role of Richard Gere as a complex lawyer in the film. He is enjoying too much to make you care for him and to add more into his troubles, he doesn't particularly have the most empathetic role in this case. Primal Fear will always be a symbol for seizing an opportunity to me, Edward Norton never lets go of his insatiable Joker-alike dual persona on the screen; it didn't speak to me as well as it did to others, but it definitely marked him on the map.",

Gere's character feels like a real broken man on the edge, but his performance is complex with tender feeling and attempted empathy for his abused client.\n\nEdward Norton is a particular revelation of acting in his major motion picture debut Primal Fear. Norton plays a shy Southern young man with a stutter, who is thrust into a case out of his depth. Norton gives so many genuine moments of innocence and something else. The several twists based around his character are shocking and intriguing to say the least. Norton gives one of dramatic acting's finest with his inspired role in Primal Fear.\n\nLaura Linney is brilliant as the tough prosecutor trying to make a name for herself in the legal world. Her hard nosed insight and intuition is very fun to watch play out as a foil to Gere.\n\nAlfre Woodard is compelling as a strict judge dealing with a very trying case. John Mahoney is perfect as the underhanded business man and legal powerhouse overplaying his cards. Alongside an affectionate and empathetic showing from Frances McDormand as a psychologist, Primal Fear boasts a stacked cast of supporting actors and actresses.\n\nUnfortunately, the running time could have been edited down significantly with many scenes just going on for too long. I think the direction is solid, but very much standard fare. You are not amazed by the direction, but rather the interesting writing and convincing performances. The music feels oddly dated from James Newton Howard with few standout musical cues. The cinematography of Chicago, while pretty in a gritty way, feels out of fashion and dated in style too. It's not as gripping in its chase sequences as it is in the courtroom. The best scenes are when Gere and Norton are just talking in private. You will remember those scenes for sure.\n\nPrimal Fear boils down to a pretty basic plot with controversial and explicit subject matter that is still highly relevant. The acting from Edward Norton, in particular, is what you should note from the dark and surprising world of Primal Fear.",

It is such a brilliantly-crafted screenplay because we go on the journey of discovery with Richard Gere’s character, and are constantly led down one path only to have it revealed that we were making false assumptions. There are red herrings to trick you into believing some elements are important, and plenty of lies being thrown around so you don’t know who to trust. The anchor for this whole film is Edward Norton. This performance might be his finest work, and it was his first major role in any film. There are a number of scenes in Primal Fear that sizzle with tense drama, and even watching it for the fifth or sixth time I still feel excitement as I wait for everything to be revealed. I’ll admit there are a few parts of the film that don’t work all that well. Some of the subplots take up too much time, the way legal aspects of the trial are handled is far-fetched, and there is one scene that never works for me in the narrative flow. However, none of those minor complaints bother me when I’m watching the film. It’s best if I don’t reveal anything more, because Primal Fear is a movie that everyone should watch unspoiled. It’s one of the few movies that genuinely surprised me, and it pulled that off multiple times.",

            "content": "Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and Edward Norton lead an all-star cast in Primal Fear. Gere is Martin Vail, one of the biggest attorneys in Chicago. A case arises when an archbishop is brutally murdered. The defendant is an altar boy from the archbishop's church named Aaron (Edward Norton), who left the scene of the crime and is covered with bloodstains of the victim. Despite these circumstances Vail believes him to be innocent of the crime, particularly as Aaron seems to be have an innocent persona, incapable of such a heinous crime. He believes it so much so decides to take on the case for free. \n\nThe prosecutor Janet Venable (Linney), believes this is an open and shut case, but knows that she has to be on her toes as her and Vail have quite a history. The two constantly play a chess match with each other throughout the film, despite the fact they somewhat feel for each other romantically. As the investigation begins, disturbing evidence comes into play that involve scandal and corruption with the archbishop. Vail uncovers that the State's attorney (John Mahoney) and real estate moguls lost millions of dollars due to the archbishop refusing to build property on church grounds. He also discovers the archbishop was involved in filming sex acts between woman and his altar boys. As this investigation unfolds, a psychiatric evaluator Dr. Arrington (Frances McDormand), uncovers that Aaron has multiple personality disorder. This diagnosis is due to Aaron's abusive past with his father, and scandal uncovered with the archbishop. This reveal gives the audience, and all the characters a completely different set of eyes on the entire case. Despite this discovery, Vail cannot now plead insanity as this would change his plead and be grounds for him being disbarred. Vail has no choice, but to try and lead the prosecution into this same conclusion. \n\nPrimal Fear was a riveting court room drama. The dark under tones of the film, the new evidence that keeps unveiling throughout the film keeps the audience guessing. Edward Norton was excellent and earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. His ability to be the innocent and somewhat slow-witted Aaron, and then transform into the dark, violent and angry persona Ray was incredible. The film does a great job balancing politics, the law, and the emotion in this murder case. The film also adds a morality aspect to the film as you begin to question if one can truly execute a person who is insane. Gere provides one of his best performances and is an excellent lead. You root for him as he looks for ways to find the best in people and strive for justice in a case that has all the odds against him. Some of the tangential characters and paths that Gere investigates as part of the corruption element are the only aspects of the movie that drag the movie down a bit. The characters are what really sell this story as all of them are convincing. I truly believed Gere was a hot shot attorney, and his was in it for the morality and not for the money. Norton's troubled past, and stutter made him quite a convincing and innocent character. The tension between Linney and Gere added a respectable element to the film. Primal Fear is worth watching for Edward Norton's performance alone. The story, cast and direction certainly build on top of this, and Primal Fear is one of the better court room dramas. \n\n-10.22.2016",

The storyline for this picture is outstanding with some wonderful twists and turns and great character development.

It's premise is simple enough, a shady, famous defense attorney takes up a seemingly open and shut case only to find out there's more to it. Unoriginal and over dramatic subplots dilute the film from being a A grade film.  But it's saving grace is the Aaron/Roy material and final climax and resolution of the case. Superb acting from Edward Norton and devilishly clever tricks allow this movie to go from from disappointing crime flop to dramatic crime thriller. The plot twist was remarkably well done and the sympathy viewers felt is relatively smuthered out by the end of the film. Do not see this movie for Richard Gere or the alluring romantic lawyer plot but see it for its core storytelling, or, as I did, for Edward Norton.",

Director Hoblit (who never really went on with the promise he showed here, even when trying to replicate similar results with Fracture a few years back) is in control of the not only the story transpiring but the actors inhabiting their roles. From bit players John Mahoney as slimy government official Shaughnessy, Laura Linney as hardworking lawyer Janet Venable and Gere as justifiably arrogant hot shot lawyer Martin Vail who does believe in the righteousness of innocent until proved guilty, the whole cast really is solidly on song. While all these elements combine to create a memorable movie set up it was in the Oscar nominated turn of young Edward Norton where this film has grown into the revered classic it is.\n\nAs stuttering choir boy Aaron, Norton wholeheartedly took control of this young man who SPOILER ALERT hides a dark alter ego below the surface who completely masks Aaron's shy and unconfident demeanour. The film's ace up its sleeve is not even revealed until past the half way mark and it's a credit to the confidence of director Hoblit and Norton that the appearance of this alter ego named Roy makes such an impact in severely limited screen time. It's a master class of acting what Norton does and come the much talked about finale there is no question what one has just witnessed is a reveal that absolutely pays off. It was a turn that well and truly deserved it's Oscar nominated recognition and till this day must be one of the most fully formed debuts by a young star in movie history.\n\nPrimal Fear is a mysterious thriller at its best and a fine example of a cast coming together to create a memorable believable ensemble. In concerns to Norton, this is a fantastic example of an actor that in his career has produced an abundance of stunning turns that in Primal Fear struck gold in arguably his most memorable performance and in a catalogue that includes Fight Club and American History X, that is quite some feat.\n\n4 and a half bloodied pumped up kicks out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

First, it is one of Richard Gere's best roles. Second, it is a terrific acting debut for actor Edward Norton (Who got an Oscar Nomination for his excellent supporting performance). Third, it is a strong credible debut for tv director Gregory Hoblit (Fallen, Frequency, Hart's War). It is a intelligent thriller that is extremely well acted by its cast (Some of the actors in supporting roles like John Mahoney, Maria Tierney and Andre Braugher are well known on TV shows). It has some genuine if nasty surprises in its storytelling.\n\nMartin Vail (Gere) is a famed defense lawyer, who doesn't care the person, who he défends are guilty or not. When a famous Chicago Archbishop (Stanley Anderson) is murder brutally in his room. Mr. Vail decides to take the case for free to defend Aaron Stampler (Norton), a mysterious oddball teenager from Kentucky. Which Aaron was covered in blood and he was running away from the crime scene. Which Aaron seems to be close with the Archbishop. But Mr. Vail finds out slowly, there is more than meets the eye with the recently killed Archbishop, since it involves corruption and more. While Aaron turns out to be a much more trouble and disturbed Young man, since he might suffer from multiple personality disorder.\n\n\"Primal Fear\" does have an lot of plot going for over two hours. Most of the storylines do pay off but there is at least, one subplot between Mr. Vail and the corrupt state's attorney John Shaughnessy (Played by Mahoney) seems to belong in a different movie for a bit and it does takes out of the film. That is probably the only real flaw in this picture. Looking at the Blu-ray special features, the original cut of the movie runs over three hours, there was one big subplot removed from the movie involving Aaron's past, which it had charactor actor Wendy Crewson playing Aaron's former teacher got deleted from the final cut. I would love to see those deleted scènes, one day but it is doubtful. \n\n\"Primal Fear\" features fine actors in it (Laura Linney, who is also quite good as Vail's former girlfriend, who happens to be an Assistant District Attorney and Oscar-Winner:Frances McDormand also appears in a small memorable part as a psychologist). It is certainly Worth seeing for the talent involved. Norton has some chilling moments in it. The twist at the finale might be disappointing for some tastes but in repeated viewings, the ending does gets more sastifying. \n\n\"Primal Fear\" is certainly unpleasent thriller but it is clever, it has some dark twists and it is more than memorable, thanks to a sharp cast and good direction by Hoblit.

The story is about Aaron Stampler, a church boy who has been charged with committed murder, after the tragic death of the Archbishop. This doesn't come unnoticed to law attorney Martin Vail who decides that he wants to stand in defence for Stampler. Throughout the film, we learn more about Stampler and his personality traits after a psychiatrist digs deeper into the mind of this boy like for example, he has a stammer and usually suffers from blackouts when under heavy pressure. Towards the end we start to hear more disturbing facts about certain things and eventually,  it all ends off with a shocking ending. \n\nI do love this film,  I feel that the way it's portrayed and directed is a big advantage to the film's credit. However,  as I review it again I feel that there are a few plot holes and the story is a bit messy at times, which does lead to a lack of the moral of the story, which is a bit of a let down.

Based on the William Diehl book of the same name, the film tells the story about an archbishop who is murdered by an altar boy, and his lawyer finds out that there's more to him than meets the eye.  The boy is shy and stutters while talking, but when threatened, he transforms into a split personality with an evil personality, never stutters and always uses violence and threats against the people who challenge him.  Edward Norton gives an incredible performance that should've won him an Oscar (he won the Golden Globe and numerous accolades, but why not the Oscar?  Goddamn voters.) as Aaron Sorkin/Roy, the altar boy charged with the brutal murder of Archbishop Rushman.  The film introduces us to tension throughout that leaves us wondering what's going to happen, suspense to keep us watching, and moments that are anything but humorous or forgettable.  The film benefits from humor that either works, falls out of place, has good or bad timing, and either help or tamper with the mood of a scene.  Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman write a script that gives an entertaining experience with numerous plot holes that give us more info about the victim, suspect, and murder.  Gregory Hoblit brings the story to life with smart direction and locations that fit well with the situations occurring.  James Newton Howard's score also helps with the mood of a scene in the film.  The biggest part of all is the incredible twist ending that still shocks viewers today due to Aaron/Roy's characterization.  The film is the perfect watching experience for anything who love this subject, as well as Richard Geres, Laura Linney, and Ed Norton.",

I mean the element of how Martin Vale becomes caught up in the complications of Aaron's issues and how he has to take an entirely new approach from there is interesting, but it doesn't save the first half of Primal Fear which was dull, generic and boring, and failed to give me a connection to any of the characters or a reason why I should be determined to keep watching it. It had so much talking but so little walking, and it was really a film that relied on Richard Gere's talents to keep the first half interesting. But since the script was dull and basic like the film itself, it gave him a standard character and director Gregory Hoblit clearly told him to be standard so that he could embody a stander lawyer. That way he fades away into the standard story and the substandard direction, so for the first half of the film Richard Gere is not a screen presence notable enough to even exist. Only Edward Norton is, and even then he has a very small amount of screen time so really the first of Primal Fear is an abysmally slow and uncreative courtroom drama that lacks any clever direction and is visually and technically dull too, so there is no surprises or sufficient entertainment within the first half and if that is what you brave yourself for then your disappointment will be lesser. And for a story that rests on the complexities of its characters, it doesn't spend that time exploring them as anything below surface level and instead spends the time merely focusing on what it is to be a lawyer and how shallow a person you must be. And though the shallowness of the first half may reflect that, it doesn't enhance the viewing experience of Primal Fear and it sets up a boring courtroom drama.\n\nOnce things get heavy in the case about halfway through, Primal Fear picks up in interest. We see the real importance go down in the courtroom and the characters become important. \nRichard Gere faces challenges as an actor and proves why he is talented, and as he gradually develops through the story we see a deeper side of him that the first half of Primal Fear shielded. We see him with the confident line delivery of a lawyer in heat delivered greatly by Richard Gere, and he works hard to convince us that he actually is one. He does a good job in Primal Fear.\nBut Edward Norton just steals the screen. It's hard to describe how powerful he is without spoiling the secrets of the film, but let's just say he has the ability to manipulate anger and fear to his liking so that audiences may fear and sympathise with him respectively. He knows what his character is doing and executed it perfectly without the audience even being able to figure it out, and so his embodiment of Aaron Stampler is absolutely excellent. Primal Fear should have taken better advantage of him, but it's focus on Richard Gere pushed him to the background. Luckily it wasn't enough to prevent him from scoring an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Edward Norton proves what real talent is all about as an actor and it's obviously no challenge for him.\nLaura Linney was also good because she was reminiscent of Jodie Foster at her finest, and she managed to grip the drama of the story with a real tenacity which was impressive and made it easy for audiences to sympathise with her and understand her.\nFrances McDormand was also a natural talent, as was John Mahoney.\nSo it's largely the cast of Primal Fear that keeps the film entertaining, and the film does explore some interesting dynamics in the second half that unfold in a good way.\n\nBut Primal Fear really is largely routine, predictable, formulaic and boring. Luckily it does feature moments of surprise and a seriously impressive effort by Edward Norton in his debut.",

The film boasts a great cast of talented actor who light up the screen and each actor brings something unique to the film. The film is notable for being the screen debut of Edward Norton who just steals the show among veteran actors like Richard Gere and Laura Linney. The film at times does have a few weak points, but with a great cast at hand that just light up the screen, it is hard to notice the film's imperfections. Edward Norton, like I said is simply wonderful in his part and he delivers a phenomenal first performance in his role of Aaron Stampler, a teen accused of killing a popular archbishop. The film is engaging from the first frame onwards and it is skillfully executed to keep you entertained. Primal Fear is one of the best court room thrillers that I have seen, and it is a film that is directed by a director that deserves much more praise than he gets. If you love thrillers that will keep you on the edge till the very end, Primal Fear is one such movie. This is a chilling piece of work that is brilliantly constructed and has a smart plot with all the necessary ingredients to make it a standout film and a memorable one that you soon won't forget. The film showcased Edward Norton's talents and it was clear that by seeing him in this early role, he would become a talented actor that would deliver terrific and engaging performances.",

Now with the internet, I finally found the movie and watched it, and I was not disappointed! I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. Edward Norton's acting in this film earned him an Oscar nomination, despite this being his first time acting in a feature film and he rightfully deserved such a nomination. His acting was top-notch in portraying the innocent-looking altar boy who was accused of murdering the archbishop and who seemingly had a psychological condition. As with 'Beauty and the Beast', this film seems to point out that one must not be judged by their looks, only, unlike 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Primal Fear' looks at this point on the negative side. With that, I think you'll know how the story ends. On the technical side, the cinematography is fine and the film score is well-done. Anyways, the whole movie is quite gripping and engaging.

            "content": "Well my rating is actually 85%, just like the user rating. This was a really addicting movie to watch. I kept watching it on my phone in an airport on Netflix. I at one point was walking towards the bathroom watching this on my phone, because it was so good. I was at the edge of my seat during the entire 2nd half of the movie. The first half was a little slow, but still really good. I find that slower crime films are more suspenseful, because they help build up for the more awesome stuff at the end. That is exactly what this film did.\n\nThis is the film that made Edward Norton a well known actor. I find that he usually plays the same role, but in this one, he was so different then his later stuff. He played a boy that was kind of wimpy almost, and the exact type of guy you would expect to be innocent. he has a stutter, and a quiet voice, with a slight accent. His character's name is Aaron, which was different from his usual role, but not a big stretch however. He also played Roy. Roy is Aaron's 2nd personality, and is very evil, and brutal. He is the one that killed the priest. He takes over Aaron, and causes him to do very violent things, which afterwards he blacks out, and doesn't remember a thing. Why Edward Norton is so good in this film, is because he plays a boy with multiple personality disorder. He plays two different people in one. Both personality's are entirely different from each other, which is why he is so good in this. He did a similar thing in Fight Club. In that movie he also played a guy that had an alter-ego, or a 2nd personality. That was his 2nd best performance, but this is his best. I won't blow the ending, because it's really good.\n\nRichard Gere plays Martin Vail, a defense lawyer. Martin is disliked because he defends criminals, which many defense attorneys are for that same reason. It's a real life cliche that you see with defense attorneys. But he really believes that Aaron is innocent, but eventually thinks he is innocent on the grounds of temporary insanity. He doesn't learn about Aaron's illness until later in the film. By the time he learns about it he has already pleaded innocent, and he doesn't think he can change his plea in the middle of the trial. He has a very intense case that he wants to win. He hurts others around him to help Aaron, but he believes he is doing the right thing. It is one of those conflicts that you see a lot in movies, where there isn't a right thing to do.\n\nThe film was very graphic, and the murder of the priest was brutal, and really disturbing. He was stabbed several dozen times, and had many other things happen to him when he was killed. However you hate him after you learn what he made Aaron do on tape. That was also a disturbing, and upsetting thing, that I won't say what it is so you can be surprised. The fact that the murder was so awful, made the emotions you get during the whole film more intense, and it gives you more of them. The disturbing part of this film makes it hard to watch, but also makes it so you want justice to be done even more so. They really do make you wonder weather or not Aaron is guilty for the first half of the film, but you are never entirely sure until the end. There were certain things that happened with Aaron in the trial that were predictable, and I found that I could predict what the last scene would be. I liked it that it was slightly predictable, because then you start to feel like I know whats going to happen, but I don't know when and how. That is why this movie is so good.",

            "content": "In the film, Martin Vail (Richard Gere), a well respected defense attorney, has made a name for himself by representing multiple high paying clients in the courtroom setting. One day, Vail catches a glimpse of a story on the local news of a young altar boy named Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) being arrested on suspicion of the murder of the Archbishop Rushman. Vail immediately goes to the jail and offers to represent Aaron in court free of charge.\n\nRichard Gere does a very good job portraying a confident and witty attorney who will do whatever it takes to get his clients off on all charges. Throughout the movie, his character shows quick thinking and smart tactics in the court room to dismiss the charges brought before the court by Vail's former love, Janet Venable (Laura Linney). In his debut on screen appearance, Norton brings his A game as he brilliantly plays a complicated character in Aaron Stampler. \n\nPrimal fear will keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The plot will constantly keep you guessing and on your toes. The writing is exceptional, and the acting performances are top notch, none better than that of Edward Norton who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. \n\nThis film is receiving four stars from me, and it is worth the watch. However, it is rated R for a reason. It contains strong language, intense violence, sexual content, as well as nudity. If you are looking for a movie to watch with your children, this may not be the film to choose. Other than that, highly recommended. An excellent watch.",

            "content": "At first sight, the story presented in Primal Fear looks strangely familiar: a troubled, socially awkward boy named Aaron (Edward Norton in a most audacious performance, and a screen debut) kills a seemingly innocent older man (in this film a priest) and is caught red-handed only moments later. A noted defense lawyer Martin Vail (played by Richard Gere), looking for new ways to boost his fame, decides to take the case and defend the murderer in court. However, it seems as though the truth is buried several layers deep, and the only way to discover the truth is to actually get to know the accused and his depraved mind. This is the moment for Edward Norton to shine. His wonderful performance (which earned him an Oscar nomination) makes Primal Fear an outstanding achievement in the court drama genre. With every new discovery the case becomes more and more confusing, and Martin starts to believe that the boy, diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, is innocent and the one, who's responsible for the brutal crime is Aaron's evil alter ego Roy. \n\nIt's a surprising and totally entertaining film, which doesn't fall into the trap of unnecessary cliches, and delivers one of the most disquieting endings in the history of the genre. Norton's career-making performance, combined with Gere's experience and bold attention to details as a lawyer, brings out all that's best and most twisted about the case presented in Primal Fear. Engaging, to say the least, plot leaves one dazzled and begging for more clues as the whole intrigue comes to a tremendous conclusion.",

            "content": "\"Primal Fear\" is your run-of-the-mill courtroom drama in almost every way. Richard Gere brings his usual slickness to the screen in playing the lead character, Martin Vail. Vail is your typical hotshot attorney, making big money to defend his likely-guilty clients in Chicago. He's no stranger to attracting media attention but everyone, including his own staffers, think he's in over his head when he decides to defend Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a 20-something altar boy who's the only suspect in the brutal murder/mutilation of a  well-known local Archbishop.\n\nThe performance of Norton is definitely the best thing about \"Primal Fear\". At only 27 years-old, this was his feature film debut and in a movie full of one-dimensional characters, he's definitely asked to do the most. The cast reads like a dream team of 90's talent--Gere, Norton, Laura Linney, Frances McDormand, and Terry O'-freaking Quinn (aka: John Locke from \"Lost\"), but with all that talent, the young Norton brings the only great performance.\n\nThe problem here isn't with storyline, direction, or execution; it's the script and aesthetics that fall well short. Instead of looking sleek and modern like its main character, \"Primal Fear\" feels like it was made in the late-80's rather than in 1996. The scoring is very bland and the cinematography is very safe, which is in direct conflict with the graphic gore (a man's fingers are chopped off with a knife in the first five minutes) and controversial subject matter (sex crimes) featured in this film. \n\nMy problem with the screenplay is that it tries to cram too much information in while still being simplistic. About halfway through the story, while Vail is searching for the mysterious \"third man\" who Stampler claims was in the room when the murder took place, a psychiatrist realizes that Stampler may have some serious mental issues, bringing his sanity into question. As I wrote before, when you have a cast of talent like director Gregory Hoblit has here, it's a travesty to give them characters that are as flat as the ones in this movie are.\n\nLike most courtroom dramas, \"Primal Fear\" boils something as complicated as a murder trial down to its most basic state. The prosecution calls 2-3 witnesses damning Stampler, then the defense calls 2-3 witnesses to provide the jury with some doubts, and (voila!) a verdict is reached. One thing I can't rip this movie for however, is the ending. \"Primal Fear\" fits in with the late-90's fad of shocking twist endings (\"Arlington Road\", \"The Usual Suspects\", \"The Sixth Sense\")...and this one is equally great! If the film leaves you feeling flat for the first 90 minutes, stick around because the ending will make it feel somewhat worth it.\n\nBottom Line: \"Primal Fear\" boasts a great cast and an effective twist ending but is ultimately an average courtroom drama.",

In the 90's, during the heyday of The Pelican Brief, The Firm, A Few Good Men, A Civil Action, and many others, legal thrillers were plentiful, and Primal Fear falls on the higher end of the wide spectrum. Richard Gere, who should really have taken more parts like this, is great as a charmingly sleazy lawyer defending the young altar boy accused of butchering a Chicago bishop. And, as the altar boy, Edward Norton is note perfect. Norton's performance-which is equal parts lovable and horrifying until the final minutes-is like an acting masterclass of misdirection, and he pulls it off with sneering, stuttering perfection. Primal Fear never paints the trial in black and white (like many legal thrillers from the era were apt to do) which, in the same way William Diehl's novel did, keeps the audience guessing as to how things will wind up. Normally I only recommend 90's legal thrillers to those with a fondness for such things, but Primal Fear really is better than most, and certainly worth seeking out on Netflix.",

            "content": "Well my rating is actually 85%, just like the user rating.  This was a really addicting movie to watch.  I kept watching it on my phone in an airport on Netflix.  I at one point was walking towards the bathroom watching this on my phone, because it was so good.  I was at the edge of my seat during the entire 2nd half of the movie.  The first half was a little slow, but still really good.  I find that slower crime films are more suspenseful, because they help build up for the more awesome stuff at the end.  That is exactly what this film did.\n\nThis is the film that made Edward Norton a well known actor.  I find that he usually plays the same role, but in this one, he was so different then his later stuff.  He played a boy that was kind of wimpy almost, and the exact type of guy you would expect to be innocent.  he has a stutter, and a quiet voice, with a slight accent.  His character's name is Aaron, which was different from his usual role, but not a big stretch however.  He also played Roy.  Roy is Aaron's 2nd personality, and is very evil, and brutal.  He is the one that killed the priest.  He takes over Aaron, and causes him to do very violent things, which afterwards he blacks out, and doesn't remember a thing.  Why Edward Norton is so good in this film, is because he plays a boy with multiple personality disorder.  He plays two different people in one.  Both personality's are entirely different from each other, which is why he is so good in this.  He did a similar thing in Fight Club.  In that movie he also played a guy that had an alter-ego, or a 2nd personality.  That was his 2nd best performance, but this is his best.  I won't blow the ending, because it's really good.\n\nRichard Gere plays Martin Vail, a defense lawyer.  Martin is disliked because he defends criminals, which many defense attorneys are for that same reason.  It's a real life cliche that you see with defense attorneys.  But he really believes that Aaron is innocent, but eventually thinks he is innocent on the grounds of temporary insanity.  He doesn't learn about Aaron's illness until later in the film.  By the time he learns about it he has already pleaded innocent, and he doesn't think he can change his plea in the middle of the trial.  He has a very intense case that he wants to win.  He hurts others around him to help Aaron, but he believes he is doing the right thing.  It is one of those conflicts that you see a lot in movies, where there isn't a right thing to do.\n\nThe film was very graphic, and the murder of the priest was brutal, and really disturbing.  He was stabbed several dozen times, and had many other things happen to him when he was killed.  However you hate him after you learn what he made Aaron do on tape.  That was also a disturbing, and upsetting thing, that I won't say what it is so you can be surprised.  The fact that the murder was so awful, made the emotions you get during the whole film more intense, and it gives you more of them.  The disturbing part of this film makes it hard to watch, but also makes it so you want justice to be done even more so.  They really do make you wonder weather or not Aaron is guilty for the first half of the film, but you are never entirely sure until the end.  There were certain things that happened with Aaron in the trial that were predictable, and I found that I could predict what the last scene would be.  I liked it that it was slightly predictable, because then you start to feel like I know whats going to happen, but I don't know when and how.  That is why this movie is so good.",

However, there are serious weaknesses, and the film's title has nothing to do with the story, nor does the packaging--the shot of Gere standing by himself. This is a courtroom drama all the way through. And before addressing the script, I should point out that Gere and Linney are former lovers, yet there is absolutely no chemistry between them. No emotion, no bitterness, no lingering feelings, no attraction, all of which are called for in the script. They simply don't work together. The film was made when Gere was a big star and performing with bravado was his thing. It really doesn't play anymore. Laura Linney was still young and fresh and wonderful, and the very young Ed Norton displays his staggering talent. Over the opening credits we hear Gere's voice, and he's saying some of the most embarrassingly trite garbage you can find outside of a cheap romance novel. Then you're going to be treated to a butcher-level murder, hideous but never explained why so hideous, and more boring perverted Archbishop and crooked politician in Chicago blather. It's all totally ridiculous. There's a surprise ending that's maybe a quarter of a surprise but actually explains nothing that happened in the entire movie you just watched. It's like the writers are saying to you \"Ha ha, you just watched the movie for two hours and thought you had it all worked out but sorry, we're going to ruin it for you\". Film studios never allow movies to end this way. How this one got out into theaters with this ending is beyond me. I'll just say this: Gere is left without a happy ending. And when you think about it after you've seen it, you realize nobody is going to have a happy ending. So the whole thing was a waste of time.",

        {
            "content": "As much as it is a powerfully fearless courtroom drama, \"Primal Fear\" is a film better remembered as the shockingly brilliant cinematic debut of Edward Norton. But to limit this film solely for that fact does not do \"Primal Fear\" justice. True, it was Edward Norton, with his performance that I wouldn't bother to call as one of the great ones in recent memory, who has carried the film from its brutal opening scenes up to the shocking conclusion, but let's not count out Richard Gere. I have to admit that I have not watched a full Richard Gere film prior to \"Primal Fear\", as I've thought that, based on some snippets that I've seen from some of his works, he's merely playing himself on all of which I've partly seen. And with 'all', I mean two or three films, so they're not much for me to judge. \n\nNonetheless, Richard Gere is seemingly at his comfort zone playing an arrogant, cocky, scene-stealing hotshot lawyer named Martin Vail that apparently takes cases because he just likes the money and the attention. But with the film judging him worthy to be its hero, Gere convincingly transformed from such a charismatic prick into a silently desperate anti-hero that may or may not care for his client's fate, an altar boy named Aaron Stampler (masterfully played by Edward Norton) who 'allegedly' murdered a prominent Catholic Bishop, but still proceeded to defend him because his instinctive hunch tells him that the boy is innocent. \n\nMeanwhile, on the side of the prosecution, there's Janet Venable, played by Laura Linney with reckless fervor and dry wit, a lawyer who takes on the role of prosecutor in the case more because she wants to keep her job (she's continually being pressured by her boss, John Shaughnessy, portrayed by John Mahoney) and less about unraveling skeletons better locked tight inside a closet. Surprisingly, both Gere and Linney had wonderful chemistry together, as their slightly humorous vibe makes the off-courtroom scenes seem to take on a bit of a comic tone, which personally makes those said scenes easier to watch even with all those barrister jargon being spontaneously thrown in the air.\n\n\"Primal Fear\", with its initial narrative spark that fully promises a tangled murder story, may be much more deceptive than how you may initially think it would be. With a story (thanks to the source novel by William Diehl) that involves the Catholic Church and some muckraked revelations here and there, the film, with us viewers not knowing what we're really in for, is founded upon an evolving and sharp-edged murder case that may look isolated yet can really be something much more, but then again, can just be the other way around. \n\nWith this simple a cyclic narrative flow, \"Primal Fear\" has been way more effective in conveying complexity through its roundabout revelations and logical beatings around the bush to achieve a certain coherence to support a conclusion that may otherwise be deemed too simple, but one that will ironically make you ponder for hours on end even by the time the credits finally run out and all else are black. \n\nDirector Gregory Hoblit, a man whose career surprisingly never took off after this very impressive film, has painted a cinematic Chicago that's like a Gotham City that never was. Modernistic in its immediate towers and skyscrapers, depreciated in its mid-dwelling apartments and almost dystopian in its underbelly, cinematographer Michael Chapman has given Chicago a proper look to accompany the film's tone and also to disassociate and contrast the murdered bishop's posh house with those of the less unfortunate ones. \n\nWhenever one hears the term 'courtroom drama', it's easy to expect some larger-than-life speeches given by the main characters, be it the lawyers themselves or the haplessly accused ones. We've seen Paul Muni's numbing speech in \"The Life of Emile Zola\", we've witnessed Gregory Peck's \"In the name of God, do your duty\" monologue as Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and we've breathlessly beheld the lingual battle between Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson in \"A Few Good Men\". \n\n\"Primal Fear's\" courtroom scenes, on the other hand, never had any big-time dialogue exchanges or killer monologues. Instead, facts are treated as facts, while short-handed evidence and wrong choices of words equate frustration and seem like nothing more. The film, after all, is truly more focused on what it has to unravel than what it has to say.\n\nTo succeed on film at a young age, there are mainly two extremes: it's either you're really, really good at what you do or you just had the looks (sometimes it's even a case of nepotism). Norton, with his brilliant acting chops, stumbled and stuttered his way into cinematic prominence. He surely has taken the hard way. Indeed the path of a true actor.",

            "content": "What begins like your classic court room drama becomes much more deeper and darker. Primal Fear has a great cast that looks into the heart of humanity and exposes an unkind and conflicting perspective.\r\n\r\nRichard Gere stars as superstar lawyer (damn, this guy plays a lawyer in, like, every other movie he's in. But damn is he good) Martin Vail who takes on a very risky case. A priest has been brutally murdered and a shy Kentucky alterboy, Aaron, is found running from the scene covered in the priest's blood. Vail doesn't care if his clients are guilty or not, and he doesn't want to know, but his sympathy for Aaron conflicts with his professionalism. Primal Fear is a great story that keeps on giving. It doesn't start out with much, besides Richard Gere's lovable charm and the murder, but what appears to be a regular \"did he do it or not\" mystery/courtroom drama eventually twists into themes of defining innocence, secret intentions, useing people for one's own advantage and trust. As a matter of fact, that's what humanity's 'primal fear' is; to fully trust someone only to have them hurt you.\r\n\r\nPrimal Fear really is a different kind of crime movie and a great courtroom drama story, but if only it didn't look like your average crime movie. The battle between lawyers is an interesting angle, but the directing lacks original flare. It's presentation may lead first time audiences off into thinking this is a kind of movie they've seen before. And the build up of the conflicting drama isn't very climactic. Though it doesn't have a lot of style, it sure looks regal enough. The sets look casual and realistic. Nothing too fancy, but that gives a good regal flavour to the movie. As a matter of fact this movie looks underproduced. It's sets and locations aren't the most flashiest or memorable. The courtroom scenes don't have much build either, but they do have their moments. But I don't want to give off that this movie is a failure by any means. Primal Fear IS done very well and has some great moments presented very well. And the weird Spanish song \"CanÃ§Ã£o Do Mar\" used as the movie's theme is a unique detail.\r\n\r\nPrimal Fear is definitely not your average courtroom drama. Especially when it presents an INCREDIBLE performance from Edward Norton in his debut role. (which earned his an Oscar nomination. PRETTY FUCKING GOOD for one's first movie role) Primal Fear might have a slow lead up, but its climax is definitely a rewarding movie experience.",

Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have arrived. It is #47 on my list: Primal Fear. It was his first film role, and he earned an Academy Award nomination for it. That should tell you something right there.\r\n\r\nThe film is about a young altar boy, Aaron (played by Norton) who is accused of brutally murdering the archbishop of Chicago. Aaron is this shy and quiet, stuttering little fish outta water southerner, who couldnt possibly have been capable of the crime, but has an impossible amount of evidence against him. Unfortunately, I cant really get into too much detail about what makes his performance so a-\\m/-mazing without giving some MAJOR spoilers. However, if you're interested, ping me and I'll let you in. I just feel the movie will have a better shock value impact if you dont know.\r\n\r\nAlthough, it was the full spoilerific plot that got me into the film. Not long after beginning my worship at the altar of Chuck Palahniuk once I'd first seen Fight Club, a friend recommended Primal Fear because of Ed Norton. He laid out the plot, the twist, and the end. I could not get my hands on the movie soon enough. Now for me, Norton's performance was all I needed to really love it, but I think it may have been even more impactful if I went in clueless.\r\n\r\nNorton isnt the only great actor in the cast. You've also got Richard Gere as his lawyer, basically playing Billy Flynn but without the singing and dancing. There's Laura Linney as the prosecuting attourney (she's also on my list of faves as a result of this film), and the ever amazing Frances McDormand as the psychiatrist analyzing Aaron.\r\n\r\nWhile a lot of it does involve the trial, its not much of a courtroom thriller. You really dont spend as much tiem in the courtroom as I think you'd need in order to classify it as such. But its also not much of a procedural since you dont really see the investigation. It's really more of a mystery, where the biggest questions are about the characters. Yeah, kinda awkward to classify. But please, just take my word for it that this is really a must see that I cant possibly recommend enough.\r\n\r\nI read the book too.

It has a great cast - this is the second film I've liked Gere in now after Days of Heaven, he gives a likable performance here. Laura Linney is good. Terry O'Quinn is a nasty bastard here. This has to be among Norton's best performances, of which there are many. And I don't even like McDormand that much usually, but she played a good character here. It has a good pacing to it that keeps you interested throughout. You care about Aaron because Norton is so likable. All of the focus on why lawyers do what they do was great too. It's also an \"F-you\" to the Catholic Church, since it reveals sexual abuse kept secret and covered up by them, which they're of course renowned for.

Where as all of the rest of the performances were nothing too special, Norton, however, puts on an exhilarating performance so captivating that every time he's on screen, I found myself dead silent and locked in on him. It's a performance that has placed him in my list of favorite actors. Still, other than giving Ed Norton the chance to make his booming debut, \"Primal Fear\" isn't too solid of a film, but still a fair watch, especially for the Ed Norton fan looking to see how it all started.",

It's the kind of debut that any player would like to make and the trick is to keep up a high standard you've already set for yourself. Which Norton to his credit certainly has in his career.\n\nBut as to Gere he plays Martin Vail, a top criminal defense attorney who will let everyone know it if they haven't figured it out. It's a tricky part because a guy this arrogant has to maintain some kind of surface likability or else you'd never believe he'd ever win a case in front of a jury. As for movie viewers they must have a rooting interest for him as well. But Gere's definitely a guy who they make lawyer jokes about.\n\nA young altar boy has murdered the archbishop of Chicago, a mush mouth kid with a Kentucky twang played by Edward Norton. He's part of a choir of street kids that the Chicago archdiocese shows off on many an occasion. It was a particularly brutal murder, multiple stabbings and the carving of a cryptic message in the chest of the deceased.\n\nGere makes no bones about it, he's wanting this case because of the headlines it will bring him. But when F. Lee Bailey or Johnnie Cochran offers to defend you for nothing, you don't ask questions.\n\nWhich brings us to Norton who has you might have gathered is not all he seems. He's a street kid and he's used to getting over on people himself. It's one of the darkest characters ever done on screen, maybe a bit too dark for Academy tastes. That might have been the reason that Cuba Gooding beat out Norton for Best Supporting Actor with his much lighter role in Jerry Maguire.\n\nOne in this film you will notice are Laura Linney as the Assistant District Attorney who Gere was once involved with and is getting a lot of pressure to bring in a guilty verdict for understandable political reasons. I also liked Alfre Woodard as the very patient judge at Norton's trial and Frances McDormand as the psychiatrist who examines Norton.\n\nIf you think you've figured out what's behind Primal Fear, rest assured you haven't from this description. Let's just say everyone gets good and played here.\n\nWhich brings to mind the dedication for this review. Gere's attorney character is likable, but arrogant. Back in the day I knew an attorney who was arrogant without any real reason for the arrogance. He'd love to have been Richard Gere, I'm sure he saw himself that way.

He protests his innocence and is believed by no one, but an ambulance-chasing lawyer named Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is willing to take his case. As time goes on, Vail becomes convinced of his client's innocence.\n\nTypical lawyer drama, like watching a two-hour episode of Law and Order-and it's just as good. Edward Norton deservedly picked up a Best Supporting Actor nom. The chemistry between the defense team-Gere, Andre Braugher, and Maura Tierney-is wonderful. Frances MacDormand turns in her usual excellent performance as the defense's psychiatrist. John Mahoney and Terry O'Quinn, as the hands behind the prosecutor's back pulling the strings, are appropriately slimy characters.\n\nAnd the ending... the ending compares with that of The Usual Suspects. Even if the rest of the movie were awful, it'd be worth renting simply for the ending. Watch and be amazed at how perfectly you were played. And then sit and wonder what happened to Gregory Hoblit. ****",

Such a great performance by Edward Norton in which is, crazily enough, his first ever film role, very impressive. That character keeps you guessing and makes you wondering exactly what his deal is, what his history is and exactly what happened with the whole case and the murder of the priest.
