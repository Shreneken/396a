    "summary": "\"Fargo\" is a reality-based crime drama set in Minnesota in 1987. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman in Minneapolis who has gotten himself into debt and is so desperate for money that he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi), (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife. Jerry will collect the ransom from her wealthy father (Harve Presnell), paying the thugs a small portion and keeping the rest to satisfy his debts. The scheme collapses when the thugs shoot a state trooper.",

            "content": "Fargo is a masterpiece of modern cinema that captivates audiences with its unique blend of dark humor, suspenseful storytelling, and memorable characters. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, this 1996 film is widely regarded as one of the best crime-comedy films of all time, and for good reason.\n\nOne of the standout elements that makes Fargo so good is its exceptional screenplay. The Coen brothers' writing is a masterclass in storytelling, filled with sharp dialogue, unexpected twists, and a darkly comedic tone. The film's plot follows a seemingly simple plan gone wrong, as a bungled kidnapping scheme in a small town in Minnesota sets off a chain of events that spiral out of control. The Coen brothers' ability to balance tension and humor is remarkable, creating a unique tone that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats while also making them burst into laughter.\n\nThe characters in Fargo are another major highlight of the film. From the quirky and bumbling Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, to the persistent and unflappable Marge Gunderson, portrayed by Frances McDormand in an Oscar-winning performance, the cast is filled with memorable personalities. The Coen brothers excel at creating complex and multi-dimensional characters that feel both real and absurd at the same time, adding depth and richness to the story.\n\nThe film's setting and atmosphere also play a crucial role in its success. The frigid and desolate landscapes of Minnesota, captured beautifully by the Coen brothers' longtime collaborator, cinematographer Roger Deakins, provide a stark contrast to the dark and violent events that unfold on screen. The juxtaposition of the serene snowy landscapes with the chaos and brutality of the crime story creates a unique and unforgettable visual experience.\n\nFurthermore, the film's use of dark humor is a masterstroke. The Coen brothers have a knack for finding humor in the most unexpected and absurd situations, and Fargo is no exception. The film's dry and deadpan humor provides a stark contrast to the violent and chaotic events that occur, adding an element of levity to the dark and gruesome story.\n\nIt's meticulous attention to detail is another reason why it stands out as a masterpiece. From the meticulously crafted accents and dialects of the characters, which add to the film's authenticity, to the carefully chosen props and costumes that enhance the story's quirks and idiosyncrasies, every aspect of the film is thoughtfully designed to create a cohesive and immersive experience for the viewers.\n\nFargo is a brilliantly crafted film that excels in every aspect of filmmaking. Its exceptional screenplay, memorable characters, unique setting and atmosphere, skillful use of dark humor, and meticulous attention to detail all contribute to its status as a true classic. If you haven't seen Fargo yet, it's a must-watch for any film lover, and for those who have, it's worth revisiting to appreciate its brilliance once again.",

The movie was done by the Coen Brothers and the end result is a movie that manages to be simultaneously hilarious, dramatic and sometimes sad.\n\nWilliam H Macy is perfectly cast as Jerry Lundegard, a car salesman at a dealership owned by his father in law who by all indications, dislikes Jerry immensely. Jerry doesn't seem cut out for the job as he cons an angry customer into adding an additional few hundred dollars of sealant to the car. Jerry is also evidently in some big financial trouble.\n\nThe plot the whole movie is centered around is Jerry hiring two sleazy criminals, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare)  to kidnap his wife Jean, played well by Kristin Rudrud. The whole plan goes off the rails  and chaos ensues. The heart of the movie is a kind police officer named Marge Gunderson (played fantastically by Frances McDormand). The movie has trademark brilliant dialogue and characters as is usual of Coen Brother movies. I highly recommend this flick, extremely entertaining.\nhttp://themoviepad.com",

            "content": "Such a simple black comedy with a simple plot is pure entertainment from the very first scene.  William H. Macy is Jerry, a sales manager at a car dealership owned by his very wealthy father in law and owing a debt of money, meets two shady characters at a seedy bar in Fargo, North Dakota to set up to have his wife kidnapped by Carl (Steve Buschemi) and his silent accomplice Gaear (Peter Stormare).  His plan to have his wealthy father in law pay the ransom to Carl and Gaear and give Jerry half to pay off his debt in exchange for a brand new car.  In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the kidnapping goes off successfully but things soon go wrong when they're pulled over by a state trooper in Brainerd Minnesota for failing to display the proper tags on the new car.  This leads to a triple homicide and the kidnappers now demanding the full ransom from Jerry for their now severe crimes.  Even worse, Jerry's father in law insists on getting involved with the money exchange making matters worse for Jerry.\nEnter Marge (Frances McDormamd), a very pregnant chief of police who's as smart as she is sweet investigating the crimes in Brainerd and Minneapolis.  Now with Marge on his tail, things become even worse for Jerry.  His father in law is murdered during the botched money exchange and he's left with no money and his wife is eventually killed by her kidnappers.  In a stroke of luck, Marge finds the car in question along with Gaear who is brutally offing his partner Carl after a brief alteration.  With Gaear in custody and Jerry now arrested, Marge simply returns to bed with his husband satisfied with another case closed.\nDirected by the Cohen brothers, they spent so much time on little details from the characters speaking in Minnesota dialect to their mannerisms and no details in explaining any character's motives for their crimes.  Who was Jerry in debt with?  Why did they kill his wife anyway?  Did Marge have a boy or a girl?  Thing is, there was so need to get into that sort of detail to make this film so entertaining and endearing in spite of some brutal violence.  The Cohen's kept it simple and fast paced as to not weigh the story down with plot details that could've spoiled the story.  It's wonderfully performed by the entire cast and absurdly funny.  Is this a remarkable film?  As the characters would say, You darn tootin', ja!",

The plot is a little slow paced perhaps and its not constantly action packed but its intriguing enough to keep you watching regardless. There are good performances from Buscemi and McDormand (perhaps slightly less so from William H Macy) and some fairly amusing aspects of the very much dark comedy plot. I have to say I didn't find it overall an especially funny watch, in the way I maybe expected, given its quite a cult classic but its certainly not bad. I felt particularly sorry for Buscemi's character, Carl Showalter. I note that the characters names are a bit quirky, much like the people themselves - somewhat animated at times, while also appearing physically fairly average. For a Coen brothers film, its not bad but not my favourite. It seemed to me to be a tale of botched criminality, with the most memorable aspect being that its set in a very snowy and dreary semi-rural area of the US, which makes the red blood of the violence stand out. It may make you cringe but yeah, I suppose I would recommend it overall.",

It predates digital movies and so it has a certain nostalgic vibe which is very worth appreciating.  The story kept me engaged, but not without moments where I derided it for demonstrating very unrealistic behavior, notwithstanding the fact that this is supposedly based upon a true story.  What bugs me is not so much a criticism of the movie, but rather the lack of appreciation for human life a couple of the criminals in the story have.  In any case, I barely remembered anything from seeing this over 20 years ago, so I decided to give it a whirl.  My time was well spent.  I liked the performances and it kept my attention rather nicely.  I don't imagine watching it again, but I'm glad that I resisted it.",

Highly Recommended if you can handle the mature themes and violence associated with this type of film, that could be considered a modern-noir film.

Frances McDormand is an enchanting presence at the center of this, bringing warmth and cheerfulness to her police chief role. A terrific crime reconstruction scene tips us that her character is smarter than her Minnesota accent lets on, and McDormand play it with splendid subtlety. Just as good is John Carroll Lynch as her adoring husband. William H. Macy gives one of those memorable \"average joe in over his head\" performances. Steve Buscemi is perfectly cast as a \"funny lookin'\" twitchy con man. Peter Stomare is scary as ruthless killer who doesn't hardly speak. The Coens deftly weave human comedy and wry observations with graphic, sometimes cruel violence. This is a dark comedy, but an optimistic one. It pulls you in and doesn't let go until the very end. It may not be \"important,\" but this is just great storytelling at its finest",

It creates a sense of transcending all orthodox genre boundaries, enveloping us in an innovative style that is always tickling the senses and leaving us guessing. It feels like a celebration of the ordinary which is itself wholly extraordinary; a mischievous invitation to the viewer to dwell among the characters as they mingle and jostle in ever-so-polite ways. \"Fargo\" will surely be remembered as a true landmark of cinema for generations to come and deserves to be treasured as an American masterpiece like none other.",

The story is somehow ridiculous enough to be believable (which is good, because it's a true story). \n\nThe atmosphere throughout beautifully captures the cold isolation of Midwestern rural winters, helped by the fact that it was actually filmed in snow-covered Minnesota and North Dakota, and also by the looming Paul Bunyan statue (one of my favorite shots). The film does a great job of building tension at making you root for the morally corrupt main character, but taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture makes the ending satisfying while still absolutely hilarious.",

When murder and mayhem ensue, it is left to pregnant police office Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) to clean things up.  As in most movies by the Coens, the dialogue is brilliant and the characters are carefully etched.  Add to this the beautifully captured landscape of barren fields covered in snow and an ingenious plot and you are left with what may be the Coens finest film.

            "content": "The first big hit by the directing duo Joel and Ethan Coen really heralded the somewhat different kind of filmmaking. Further films like No Country For Old Men, A Serious Man or True Grit followed and finally established the Coen Brothers as masters of their craft. Fargo contains all the elements that their style stands for: unorthodox violence, the discreet incorporation of comedic aspects and a plot that seems very simple at first glance, but which brings much more meaning and hidden social criticism after watching the film several times.\n\nBesides the Coen Brothers, the film was also the big breakthrough of acting icon Frances McDormand. Her character Marge Gunderson does not appear as often as one would expect from the \"main character\". When she is seen, she delights with her amiable nature, which is topped off by her stubborn naivety and belief in the good. McDormand also masters the Minnesota accent perfectly, which only makes her character more likeable and refreshing. She is never really aware of the gravity of the situation at any point and is constantly miles off the mark as the police officer in charge of the occurring crime. William H. Macy's slightly crazy character Jerry Lundegaard is the centre of the film at the beginning. The main action starts from him and he is pretty much the opposite of Marge: he always knows what is going on and is shady without end. Although he has no real evil intentions, pretty much all of his plans go awry, leaving him constantly on the run and always quick to lose his cool. Macy plays big and makes this shambles of a man weirdly likeable. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are responsible for the more brutal moments as the crooks and are hilarious in their scenes together because of the difference of their characters.\n\nIt is not for nothing that a television series of the same name was developed based on Fargo. The peculiarity of this film still has a cult following for many. Also beautiful to look at is the completely snowed-in Minnesota and the cast covered in fur coats. The performances by McDormand, Macy and Buscemi of course help the plot, which is a little dull towards the middle, enormously. It picks up towards the end without offering a big showdown or explosive finale. Fargo is generally a rather quietly constructed film that uses its violent scenes very selectively. What is so impressive is the socio-critical factor behind it. There is a clear demarcation between good and bad people. The Coen Brothers are not above depicting this in sometimes very subtle but also extreme ways. Fargo is rightly an important part of film history that should be watched alone for the fact that the Coen Brothers really took off with it.",

Fargo is an underrated film in the crime thriller series.\n\nFargo is a crime thriller based around a botched kidnapping plot.

One thing that makes this film so powerful is how it brought down everyone to levels we can understand. These can be our family members, neighbors, even used-car dealers.  Nearly every character and setting is memorable in this film. Who doesn't wish they had a Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) on their team??\n\nAnother aspect I enjoyed about this film is the unpredictability of the plot. The events in the film feel believable and are not absurd. Everyone's motive is clear and upfront and there's no nerfing of the plot.\n\nNot to mention the goriness and grotesque murders contrasted with the cheeriness of peak Midwestern quirkiness.

It features great performances from Steve Buscemi, and in particular Frances McDormand, who definitely deserved her best actress award. Her subtle performance contrasts the usual hard-boiled police detective with a kind almost motherly character, who is just trying to get her job done. In particular, her monologue in the police car towards the end and her conversation with her husband, really tie the film together, as she appreciates the smaller things in life, despite the cold, absurd and uncaring reality surrounding her, This makes it a more optimistic entry from the Cohen brothers. The dialogue is hilarious, in particular the exchanges with Steve Buscemi's character, and the old high school friend with mental problems. This film is also yet again beautifully shot by Roger Deakins,  Overall, this film is definitely worth the watch and a good way to pass 1 hour and 40 minutes.",

The film's northern midwest setting adds to its comedy, showing the sickeningly polite lives of the various police officers, witnesses, and civilians. This is in stark contrast to what is undoubtedly the film's best quality- the performance of Steve Buscemi. This might be my favorite role of his, and I just adored seeing his smarmy character onscreen and thee mishaps surrounding his cocky decisions. This is one of those films where pretty much everyone other than the protagonist is an idiot, but it feels realistic rather than frustrating, so I'm laughing at their under-reactions instead of yelling at them through my television. Speaking of the protagonist, I love her. She's a strong and charming female lead who played a great straight man in this plot of blissfully unaware Minnesotans.\nMy only real critique of this film is that there are several parts of its plot that seem to serve no importance. Protagonist Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) has a baby due that is never really brought up except in passing, and yet is addressed right in the last few lines of the film as if it were an important element all along. She also has a friend named Steve (Mike Yanagita) who has a small B-plot that never seems to tie to anything else. But overall, I can put most of that aside as I watch Steve Buscemi yell at everything that mildly perturbs him.",

            "content": "I was very underwhelmed by this film as I had expected to see a classic that made me laugh and feel slightly disturbed at once but instead what I got was a mildly amusing film that was too slight to have real impact. The ‚Äòdark humor' of the film was either so subtle that it was lost on me when it wasn't hitting me over the head or it just made occasional appearances that didn't leave me giggling but occasionally elicited a half smile from me. Part of the problem might be that I have never really connected with the work of the Coen brothers as I don't think that A Serious Man (2009) or No Country for Old Men (2007) are masterpieces and their humor often irritates more than amuses me. Considering the fact that this is seen as one of their best films I did have higher expectations however and even my parents, tough critics, liked this film so I assumed it would be brilliant, it really was not.\n\nJerry Lundegaard, William H. Macy, decides to organize the kidnapping of his wife in order to extort his wealthy father in law and solve his financial problems. His plan quickly spirals out of control as the kidnappers he hires, Carl, Steve Buscemi, and Gaear, Peter Stormare, accidentally shoot a police officer and his father in law complicates the exchange of the money. Investigating the case is well-meaning police officer Marge Gunderson, Frances McDormand, who uses her sensible nature to solve a difficult case and in the end even Lundegaard receives his comeuppance.\n\nThe plot was vaguely entertaining as a farcical series of events in which people's lives became more and more complicated as the stress piled on. The plot wasn't enough to keep me engaged though as I suffered through long scenes of Gunderson going on what was meant to be a funny awkward date with an ex-classmate who lies to her face. The humor sometimes felt like it was getting in the way of what could have been an interesting plot as we cut from interesting scenes of the kidnappers shooting a police officer to Marge and her husband having lunch and speaking in the annoying over the top dialect that the Coens fetishize. I wish that they had settled on a tone or chosen to fully go one way or another because as the film is it's an unsatisfying experience.\n\nThe screenplay frustrated me because it's laugh lines felt so self congratulatory and the moments at which we get darker elements felt so contrived. I don't like how they write because so often you end up spending time with characters who have one joke to them that Coens play out over and over again until you just want the film to end. For example, in this film every character says \"You, betcha!\" at one point and although it was initially a fun little quirk I quickly became tired of hearing it and wanted to see something new on screen despite the film's short length. A movie like this should not feel tiring but the Coens as both writers and directors do not have a handle what film they are really trying to make. There may be a great film buried in here but the Coens don't have the ability to draw it out and at this point I doubt they ever will.\n\nAs for McDormand's performance I dispute the idea that she is a leading actress because I felt that she was a supporting character when compared to Lundegaard. I don't think she earned her Academy Award, especially when considering the fact that Emily Watson and Brenda Blethyn were nominated in the same year. She is funny enough and brings a certain warmth and strength to the part but she is not enough to save the film from itself and is clearly being pushed to give a broader performance than is necessary.\n\nFor a film that was called one of the greatest of all time I found very little to appreciate and I don't think that modern viewers will either. This is one of those where I truly cannot understand where all the hype comes from and I don't think I will ever watch this film again.",

While watching the film, I thought a lot about how much more complicated the story became when more people got involved. It made me feel anxious when watching it as a result. √¢Fargo√¢? fits into the crime drama by not being a drama and rather a dramedy. Personally, I would have liked if the comedic moments were played up a little more. The comic relief was always Frances McDormand, who I loved. My favorite part of the writing in the film is how complicated and mucky things get as time goes on. An example of this is when Jerry√¢(TM)s father-in-law wants to get involved in dropping off the money and ends up getting shot and killed. In terms of directing, I thought that it was an interesting choice to have Jerry still be carrying the groceries when he√¢(TM)s walking upstairs to see where his wife is. It added to the character√¢(TM)s eagerness to see if his plan worked. My favorite scene in regard to editing is when the robbers are breaking into the house. The shots bounce between the wife√¢(TM)s reaction and the crowbar knocking more and more into the door to the bathroom that she√¢(TM)s hiding in. The editor really took their time with each shot and it really amps up the tension. Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson is tremendous. I love her √¢can do attitude√¢? and positive spin on everything. When she is first investigating the triple homicide, she views everything matter-of-factly as if she were discussing the weather with someone. Though the cinematography wasn√¢(TM)t my favorite overall, I enjoyed when the robbers are chasing after the guys who spotted them killing the cop. The shot of the road ahead of them is really interesting because half of the shot is the road and half of it is the dark night and you can faintly see the red taillights before them disappear. The production value overall was great. Regarding the sound design, I appreciated when the guy is watching TV √¢\" the TV is fuzzy, and the sound quality is really fuzzy and murky. The sound designer did a good job matching the sound quality with the production value of the screen.",

This one was a hit, as their brand of humor worked wonderfully with the wild situations these characters got put through. William H. Macy (Jerry Lundegaard) and Steve Buscemi (Carl Showalter) were both hilarious in their roles. It's some of the funniest work I've seen from either of them. Frances McDormand (Marge Gunderson) was her usual fantastic self. The script is witty and filled with sharp dialogue, while there are plenty of moments that manage to surprise you. There are several violent scenes that are done with the right cadence, making sure they fit in with the humorous tone of the film. They also do a strong job making things interesting and keeping them moving, despite happening in what is traditionally a handful of bland places.\n\nWeaknesses: Though it's enjoyable, it does still have some of the issues I've found with other Coen Brothers flicks. The characters are meant to be bumbling idiots, and it's funny, but it also hurts a handful of scenes as they become so ridiculous, they're hard to believe. Some scenes feel kind of useless and hard to get interested in, like the one involving Marge and Mike. There wasn't a ton in the ways of arcs or characters learning much, and by the end, I didn't get a true sense of accomplishment or closure.\n\nOverall: I wouldn't consider it one of the best films ever or even of the 90s, but it's still damn good. It blends violence with suspense and dark comedy in a way that few other films can properly boast. It's a fun movie and sometimes, that's all you're looking for.",

            "content": "When I watch a film I haven't seen before, I seldom form a solid impression of how much I enjoy the film until at least the movie's midpoint, and occasionally not until allowing for a day to sort through my thoughts and emotions. Fargo is a rare exception, a film which grabbed my attention within moments of the opening titles. Carter Burwell deserves a large measure of credit, as his beautiful opening theme gave me chills upon hearing it for the first time and continues to do so every time I watch the scene ‚Äì I fully believe he deserved an Oscar nomination for his contribution. The theme is set to a shot of a car driving down a small road sandwiched between two snow-covered North Dakotan farm fields. The scene is so skillfully shot that it makes the mundane sight of a car driving along a snowy road visually interesting, an early hint at the skillfulness of Roger Deakins' cinematography. A few shots later, three of the main players are introduced - two half-witted criminals, the overly talkative Carl Showalter and the reticent Gaear Grimsrud, and Jerry Lundegaard, a hapless car salesman with an ill-conceived plan to solve his financial troubles, one so badly thought out that even the dumb-as-dirt criminals comment on the senselessness of it ‚Äì he is going to have the criminals kidnap his own wife.\n\nThe scene illustrates Fargo's brand of humor. It is rarely laugh-out-loud funny, but the combination of the exaggerated Minnesota accents, the quirky, bizarre, and sometimes abnormally polite dialogue, and the deadpan fashion in which the actors deliver this dialogue give the film a slightly surreal, humorous undercurrent which takes the edge off the occasional brutal violence. And there is a fair amount of violence, because in addition to a comedy, the film is also a blood-drenched crime thriller, albeit one in which the criminals are closer in competence and ambition to the burglars from Home Alone than Michael Corleone. The beauty of Fargo is that it works well as both. Some people watch it more for the humor. Others watch it for the dramatic elements. Whether you find the underlying story humorous or chilling, the storytelling is brilliant.\n\nTo illustrate the elegance of Fargo's storytelling, I present one of my favorite scenes in cinematic history - the famous TruCoat scene. Many movies, even good movies, present background information by having two characters tell each other things they should already know: \"You're asking if your Jerry lies? Oh, you betcha, yah! He's terrible at it, though. I feel kind of bad for him when I see how his father-in-law treats him like dirt.\". This scene is a master class on how to deliver exposition in a more interesting manner. After the establishing shot of the dealership where Jerry works, we see a hint at Jerry's own insignificance ‚Äì Jerry's picture hanging on the dealership wall, lost among a sea of other salesmen. This sense of insignificance is implicitly one of the reasons he tries his hand at crime. This shot is followed by an incredible exchange in which the Jerry attempts to deceive a couple into believing that an expensive sealant isn't optional. His lies are so blatantly transparent that the couple sees right through them, and Jerry even looks ashamed at his own dishonesty. All this exposition is accomplished without a single word of expository dialogue and while creating a scene which is fascinating to watch.\n\nJerry is a fascinating antagonist. He has such understandable motivations and is so inept and nonthreatening that he barely classifies as a villain, yet my sympathy for him was strained by the thoughtless evil of setting a risky, badly thought-out plan into motion and then sitting back with a look of bemusement as the bodies pile up. William H. Macy was dead set on playing the hapless salesman, and I find it hard to imagine the character without his stuttering mannerisms and snap on smile. The performance earned Macy a well-deserved Oscar nomination, and his character is one of my personal favorite villains, both on account of Macy's performance and the uniqueness of his character.\n\nAs important as Jerry Lundegaard is to the film's plot and as much as his character adds to the film, he is not the protagonist. The real protagonist, only introduced a third of the way through the runtime, is Marge Gunderson, a pregnant small-town police chief who becomes involved in the case after Lundegaard's out-of-control scheme results in the spilling of blood within her jurisdiction. Despite her late appearance, Marge Gunderson is not only the only character with a full character arc, but also the heart of the film. Without her, the film might come off as mean spirited, creating a bunch of evil, pathetic characters for the audience to mock. She is portrayed, however, as a smart, moral individual whose only flaw is being a tad naive, thus preventing the film from feeling like an exercise in schadenfreude. Frances McDormand plays the character beautifully, winning her first Academy Award for her portrayal of the character as a folksy but deceptively intelligent and strong woman, elevating an already strong and well-written character into my pantheon of movie heroes.\n\nThe supporting cast is also very strong, with a well-cast Steve Buscemi as Carl Showalter and an imposing performance from Peter Stormare as the silent Gaear Grimsrud. I struggle to find any faults in the film. Perhaps the statement at the beginning of the film that the movie is based on a true story (it's not) is a bit deceptive, but it is also a well-established literary device. Fargo also holds a special place in my heart as one of the films which got me interested in the medium. Without this film, I likely wouldn't be sitting here and writing this review. I originally watched this film several years ago, and 200 movies later I have yet to find a film I enjoy more. Perhaps this nostalgia makes me a biased reviewer, but even many critics without my personal connection to the film consider it one of the best movies of the 1990s. If I only ever convince you to watch one film, I would like this to be it.\n",

No, the movie progresses as the various different characters find their own dilemmas, make mistakes and hastily try to clean them up.\n\nI knew this movie was going to be good, let's be honest. Noah Hawley picked up this as a TV series for FX, so of course this was going to be good. I didn't know it was going to be this brilliant, though! The Coen brothers are apparently masters of their craft, with their beautiful shots and a confident way of storytelling. A story that jumps between several different perspectives of different characters could have become a confusing mess, but they managed to make it plausible and fun.\n\nWhat makes Fargo so special? Believe it or not, I'd say their sense of humor. They're often very subtle, but I especially like how the script kept repeating the word \"yeah\" so that the more characters said it, the more comical it got, even when the situation was very serious. I just love how realistic it felt, from the reminder that \"this is based on a true story\" at the beginning to how we see the characters perform their daily lives. I don't know why, but it contributed to the humor within a dead serious narrative. I also loved the characters, too. They were all flawed in their own way(Jerry Lundegaard is the worst character, I think . . . at least Carl took a bullet to his cheek to pursue his goal, Jerry's a snake).\n\nI've got a lot more to say if I wrack my head around a bit more, I'm sure. But that's the thing about my reviews, they're just my immediate thoughts about the movie, or at least immediate when I'm typing these words. If you're looking for an in-depth review, read another person's. This is just my feeling about a movie, okay? And Fargo is a great movie.",

            "content": "The ordinariness of the characters in this film are so carefully crafted, and if the scenes are carefully analysed in the light of all the information, the characters are really not simple and black/white as they seem. The Coen Brothers, being brought up in Minnesota, critique the Minnesota Nice nature - people with their plain and warm exterior with folksy speaking style, but not so empathetic or well-wishing from within; the characters are as cold and distant as the letters of the film title because the characters are as emotionally isolated as story's vast empty landscape. The accent and snow, the white and distant environment, all these things accentuate the feel of the living conditions and community of northern US. I can't testify to the accuracy of the time and place, but the Coens surely give us an intriguing character study.\n\nThe film takes quite a few witty jabs at capitalism and consumerism; it explores people's (here, especially Americans') obsession with fast food, television and cars. The realistic dialogues and quirkiness do make the characters stand out, like all Coen Brothers films. Many might say Marge Gunderson is the only character with good morals, but she isn't as pure as she seems. Marge, though an interesting character who defies prescribed gender roles and becomes our lead protagonist (though she enters only after one-third the film), she is as emotionally distant as the rest, as evidenced from her murder-scene inspection and ending ride with one of the kidnappers. Her routine life and by-the-book procedure, combined with her husband's not-so-sophisticated paintings about ducks and the decor of their house, exemplify the fact how they are a regular couple in a consumerist web so blissfully content in their simplicity and mediocrity.\n\nExpectation vs what's given to us. From the opening title where it says that this is based on a true story and events are shown as it occurred, a certain expectation is set. The Coens take advantage of this liberty and tell the story in the most unusual but interesting way. But they subvert these expectations by slowly inserting scenes that people couldn't have known (if the events are being shown as they occurred). But this helps us understand the characters much better. (We now know that almost the entire thing is fictional, other than, maybe, the murder that inspired them.) The Coens do this throughout the film. Two other good examples come from the scene where Marge meets her Asian friend from college. Compared to the ways Asians are traditionally portrayed in films, Mike really stood out - not at all a clich√©d, accented Asian guy, but an emotionally unstable lonely guy who still stays with his parents in his 30s. And the story he tells Marge about his life, we immediately lap it all up, just like Marge does, not realising that the story had the exact plot details from 'Love Story'. The Coens surely take other such jabs at American pop culture. It's not what you expect from a true-story-based crime thriller. It's not what you expect from a comedy. Coen Brother films never usually fit into a single genre, and the unusual blend of crime and humour makes the film stand out.\n\nAnd without Roger Deakins, the film wouldn't look the way it does. That parking lot scene has been praised and analysed to death by now. And yes, it's a spectacular shot and has so much to say. The acting from everyone in the cast is terrific, especially Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Macy gives us such a unique and memorably loathsome character - an apathetic, selfish and cowardly hypocrite, always maintaining such a cheery facade. But he represents the frustrations felt by the pawns in the capitalist system, rarely able to earn or save much to be financially or emotionally satisfied. Hence, his various schemes to collect enough money, run away and start a new comfortable life.\n\nThough just a little less than 100 minutes, the film has been assembled with such attention to detail and innovation that it can be analysed and understood in so many different ways. It's not something that seems so great in the first view itself, but the more you see it or think about it, the more it lingers in your mind. Clever to end the film with the words \"Two more months\", since we know it might be a reference to the end of winter when the snow might melt and reveal the suitcase to a passerby.",

            "content": "From the persistent buzz over the Coen brothers and the reputation of this film, many would and have argued that Fargo is an American classic. After watching it myself, I would beg to differ. For me, Fargo highlights an interesting conundrum I have stumbled upon in the last few weeks, which centers around my inability to zero in on anything that the Coen brothers have actually contributed to film over their illustrious 30+ years of directing and writing. Certainly, they have influenced pop culture in that films like Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and The Big Lebowski have become well known icons of American culture, albeit curiously disassociated from their creators. But in terms of film, I can't manage to hit on anything the brothers have offered. Kubrick pioneered abstract film and the portrayal of science fiction elements. Ridley redefined tension and introduced neo-noir. Lucas invented the modern blockbuster. Spielberg revolutionized special effects. All of these great directors left clear and obvious marks on every film they created and every film created since. The Coen Brothers haven't managed to do this. Instead they have carefully cultivated a mysterious, awards heavy fame that often gets them into GOAT conversations, despite the apparent lack of pedigree needed to even be in the same room. Fargo is a great example of this. Propelled by its quirky nature and a bit of artistic flair, the movie has become a powerhouse of great American film. In reality, Fargo is a well constructed dark comedy with a bit of slightly above average commentary on capitalism and the American lifestyle. Is the movie well crafted and filmed? Sure, but did it really change the game? I think the answer has to be no. If anything, the performances are what set Fargo apart, not the directorial style. Convincing accents and excellent poise from all of the actors involved are what define the movie. But overall, the film is relatively flat, a common problem for the Coen Brothers. Overuse of midwestern cliches, snow shots and a repetitive plot leave the viewer interested but unimpressed. The presentation is pretty common for the 90s, as is the tone. The American Dream commentary is interesting but ultimately infinitely better handled by American Beauty, released only 3 years later. The film also feels strongly dated, firmly anchored in the time period by an overfocus on certain cultural aspects. Compared to American Beauty, a film with some similar themes, Fargo just doesn't hold up. Mendes creates something timeless with American Beauty.

It is hard to really pinpoint how to categorize this movie.  Comedy, drama, thriller, action.... Fargo has it all.  There are only 3 people that can make you laugh at things you probably should not be laughing at and that is the 2 Coen brothers and Tarantino.  Fargo is a just a great movie all around.  The characters are great and funny although out of their mind insane.  The movie is brutally violent  but in the midst of all this blood and violence and downright heartless killing you are laughing hysterically.  Every actor shines in their role during Fargo.  It won Best Picture as it should have and just further proves that the Coen brothers are without a doubt 2 of the greatest directors of all time.",

The Coen Brothers' style is used to perfection in this movie, as the writing, acting, and cinematography are all phenomenal. This movie has you laughing your butt off one minute, and holding your breath in shock at the next. McDormand is really spectacular, Buscemi is hlariously great, and Stormare pulls off my favorite performance of his. This movie is hilarious, dark, and memorable. 9.25/10",

            "content": "As we read the text informing us that Fargo is a true story (which is a lie), we are introduced to the somber music which contains a medieval feel to it, being performed on harp to start, then switching to the use of more strings and drums.  This small portion of music is powerful in that it conveys exactly the tone of the movie: we know collectively as an audience that this will be an upsetting story which takes place in a fairly \"innocent\" location - Minnesota.\n\nWhy is this film titled \"Fargo,\" exactly?  It is where everything is set into motion.  The William H. Macy character (Lundegaard) drives up there to meet the two \"villains\" of the story who he employs to kidnap his wife so that they may con money from his wife's father.  We don't know this right away, however; in fact, the information we're told is only certain bits, so we cannot fathom how simple this rather complex plan really is at first.  Making the situation complex for the viewer, however, lets us know that anything can and will go wrong - and what do you know, it does.\n\nWhile Frances McDormand may be the protagonist of the story, let's talk first about the best talent in this film - William H Macy.  After watching this film, without knowledge of the show \"Shameless,\" I doubt anybody could predict this actor would be a good fit for Frank Gallagher in Shameless - stubborn as hell, alcoholic, selfish, terrible father, anything but respectable.  In Fargo, Macy portrays Lundegaard with perfect execution, a role on the opposite pole of his iconic Frank Gallagher.  Lundegaard is a first time criminal, and it shows through the fact that he is an every-day-nice-guy, not very outspoken, and holds in his anger so much that he explodes when he needs to let it out.  Macy tackles the overall nervousness of the character so well that he develops perfect mannerisms for the character - looking down due to shyness frequently, moments of losing control that are just right and not overly dramatic, stuttering, and a stupid smile to retain his innocence despite the horrific plot he carries out, putting his family in danger time and time again.  Macy's portrayal is arguably the best performance of the film, yet he lost the best supporting Oscar to none other than Cuba Gooding Jr's role in \"Jerry Maguire\" that year.\n\nAnother strong aspect of the film is the character played by Steve Buscemi.  Everybody thinks it, and the Coen brothers say it time and time again in their script:  Steve Buscemi sure is a \"funny-looking fellow.\"  This is brought up at least twice by witnesses in the case - one prostitute and one bartender, who act as substitutes for the audience, the voyeur, the cinephile who observes and comments, but does not contribute much to the actual story.  Buscemi's character is egotistical, funny, filled with rage; he is given authority which he does not deserve as Shep, who put Lundegaard in contact with Buscemi's friend, did not vouch for the Buscemi character.  Buscemi is the comic relief to his counter part's scary, more dominating and menacing presence - he is a giant compared to Buscemi and does not talk unless it has to do with the job they have set out to do.  This seems to be one of the only reasons Buscemi has to do practically everything - he goes alone on the actual \"exchange\" of the money and Mrs. Lundegaard, leaving only him to have to deal with the near-fatal surprise in store for him.  He returns with the money for his partner (though he does not tell him there is much more buried in the middle of nowhere) and he rightfully complains that Gaear did not suffer an injury like him, though his deception is greedy and egotistical.  It turns out that Gaear has a greedy nature too, possibly much greedier than Carl (Buscemi) since he thinks a sum of only eighty thousand dollars is involved and his reaction is very extreme.\n\nThen we have Frances McDormand, playing Marge Gunderson, the protagonist who does not show up until thirty minutes into the film.  If it were not for the presence of this character in the film, this movie would be an extremely depressing story.  Marge represents the average Minnesota citizen who finds happiness with the simplicity of family life.  She serves the police force as she serves her family - she is the sole breadwinner for her and her husband Norm, and she is pregnant, yet embarks on this mysterious, dangerous journey to find two murderers in order to put them behind bars.  Her short speech to Gaear towards the end of the film is exactly what the film needs - it is reassurance that we are not alone in this world when we don't understand the evil behind greed which drives people to do the most awful things and strive so far from morality.\nOne final comment is that I love the presence of the character Mike Yanagita in this film.  Most people would find this character to simply be a comic relief character, but as my brother pointed out, the fact that he lied about his life and was so convincing about it drives Marge to return to Lundegaard, who appeared to be just as innocent as Mike on the surface.  To be honest, I thought this character was simple comic relief on first impression, but this didn't make too much sense to me since it did not drive the story further if that was the case, and I knew the Coen brothers are considered great filmmakers.\n\nI very strongly recommend this film to all viewers who are comfortable with watching an R-rated film:  it is simply one of the greatest dark comedies/crime dramas ever made.",

I know Fargo is a well-loved and respected film, but I'm starting to think I prefer the Coens' pure comedies instead of their attempts at blending drama with comedy. There's also a chance I was expecting something remarkable, so this was bound to disappoint. The story is actually surprisingly simple, in fact it's extremely reminiscent on Blood Simple. A husband hires men to hold his wife hostage in order to get a cut of the ransom money. Of course, as one would expect from a Coen film, crimes never go that smoothly. In fact Fargo is just a series of mistakes and clues for the cops to follow. Luckily, the cop becomes the protagonist of the film about halfway through. The fun of Fargo is entirely in the contrast of the serious events that are occurring, and the small-town friendly nature of people who live in Minnesota. William H. Macy is particularly fantastic as he perfectly embodies that classic Midwestern trait of bottling up negative emotions and putting on a friendly face even when your world is crashing down around you. I also liked Frances McDormand's character of Marge because she defies every expectation you might have about her from her appearance. She is friendly and sweet, but also a great investigator.\n\nI think the biggest issue I had with this film was connecting with the characters and I feel that stems from the lack of depth given to most of them. It seems almost every person in this film is simply one-note. Jerry is frustrated and repressed, Marge is deceptively astute, Carl is horny and agitated, Gaear is evil, Wade is grumpy, etc. There is no character who has an arc either, no one grows or really changes because of these events, things just kind of happen. The problem that results from my lack of investment in the characters is that I started to feel like there was a lot of stuff they could have cut. It sounds horrible to say about a film that so many people adore, but in the long run Fargo felt like something they could have cut down to be a single episode of a police procedural on TV. I guess I'm just a slave to more traditional Hollywood film-making, because I think I would have had greater enjoyment if they focused in the entire film on just one side of the story, instead of bouncing around between 3 or 4. Naturally all of this complaining makes it sound like I hated the movie, which is not true. In fact I found it enjoyable, and had a few chuckles here and there. Expectations obviously played into my reaction to Fargo, because if I only planned on seeing a fun little crime drama I would have been satisfied, but since several people in my life celebrate it as one of their favorite films of all time it just couldn't live up. Still I recognize the aspects that people enjoy and appreciate the quality of the film-making in Fargo.",

Why did the movie spent so much time on her? So many of her scenes were just pointless, especially the diner scene she was in. That has to be the most pointless scene in the movie. Take her scenes out, the movie would hardly be different, in fact , it would be more interesting.

Macy is a sleezy car salesman who is hard up for money probably because of his shady ways. He seems decent but really he's sleezy dude.\n\nHe plans to have his wife kidnapped and for his wealthy father in law to pay the ransom. However things go very wrong and it just goes from there.\nAll the personalities just fit with each other. ..it just clicks and it's hard to explain.  The dark humor blended with a nice score make this a must see.\nThe Coens being from Minnesota embrace the harsh winter and accents nicely in the movie.  \nIt's just a wild dark comedy with fantastic personalities and a wild plot.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThere it is. The first Coen brothers film where I can confidently say, \"That was a great film!\" The funny thing about it is that Fargo is a playful film behind its veneer of murder and greed; and it regards to themes and characters, I have seen brothers tackle much deeper. For the bulk of the film, I saw Fargo like I saw Pulp Fiction, it is purely entertaining fiction, or in this case non-fiction. It delivers interesting and quirky characters that keeps my attention on edge, there is always something amusing to see or listen to in Fargo; right down to the little mannerisms of its Minnesota characters.\n\nFargo starts out small, detailing a plot that feels simple and straight-forward, but then it starts to snowball, becoming much larger than anticipated. As the situation becomes larger, so does the greed of its characters; they feel that an increase in their work needs to be justified with a correlating increase of payout. The film however does not leave them as basic blueprints or generic archetypes, each character displayed on screen have character; shaped by its dialogue and personalities. Jerry Lundegaard, the man who started off with the plan, is the film's most grounded character and he plays difficult role of an sympathetic antagonist, at least for the first two thirds of the film; we feel sorry for him and in a way we want him to succeed as early on the film, he was cheated by those that are much greedier than him. The \"true\" antagonists of the film Carl and Gaear are wonderfully written characters, with distinct personalities, that makes them more than just villains; whether it may be the constant rambling of Carl or the dark silence of Gaear, there is more to their character than the villainous actions they perform.\n\nThe film's central protagonist, Marge Gunderson, is a plain cop who is just out there doing her job. For much of the second act, we follow her in this investigation, and even with her \"lack\" of exaggerated character, it never at all become boring to watch and this is because the Coen brothers have used the accents, mannerisms, and values of a Minnesotan that are enough to make up for what is missing. I say that her character is not exaggerated because she clearly isn't, it feels authentic and honest; the brothers simply just placed it in a script that is darkly funny. The character of Marge Gunderson is much more than just a character to follow, she also acts as a shining figure of what humanity should be; contented. This is a woman who is enjoying the simple things in life, being simply grateful of what is right in front of her, not letting the nature of her profession corrupt her in any sort of way; she lives her life and practices her profession with a bubbly smile and pure dedication. The Coen brothers make this more apparent through constant contrasting of the different characters, making the antagonists of the film always in a state of stress and confusion and her simply being her.\n\nThe performances in this film were no doubt strong but to say that Frances McDormand deserved the Academy Award, for me, is a bit of a stretch. She was up against the juggernaut that is Emily Watson, for her performance in Breaking the Waves, which to me was one of the best acting that I have ever seen in film. It may seem that I am proclaiming that McDormand is not deserving of praise, because she certainly does, not many actresses could play a role that is simplistic in character but at the same time quirky and memorable. The rest of the cast were also memorable, but definitely not as funny or as interesting as McDormand's performance, the closest that would match up to what she brought would be William H. Macy, playing a role that is constantly in a state of panic, attempting to get what he wants but at the same time doing so without losing face; he must be seen by his peers and the audience as a good and innocent guy. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the film's antagonists were also great, delivering hilarious conversations back and forth between one another, allowing the would-be dull moments feel interesting.\n\nFargo is a film that does not try to be ambitious, it simply is there to tell a story that is entertaining and original; and sometimes that is all a film needs to be great.",

Fargo is something they know well, crimes gone bumbling array. Violent at times, hilarious most of the time. I can't help but love Frances McDormand in most roles but Margie is one of the best. William H Macy is also great in this flick. Somehow, even though he is a very flawed human being on the point of almost being evil, you can't help but root for the man who pays men to kidnap his wife and in doing so they end up going on a murdering spree in this sleepy little town. The movie earned 7 Academy nominations including best picture and won 2, Frances McDormand and best Screenplay for the Cohens.

            "content": "Jerry Lundegaard is a simple man, holding a simple job. He knows nothing about the complications in the lives of others, nothing about money, or even fatherhood. So too is Marge Gunderson, a Brainerd, Minnesota police officer who leads the life you would expect of a police officer in Brainerd, Minnesota. It's no wonder Jerry is out of his element trying to commit a crime.It's no wonder Marge has a hard time keeping up.\n\nSet in the northern regions of the American Midwest, the Coen brothers place Fargo in isolation, with harsh snowy landscapes, imperviously iced lakes, and characters who pronounce \"gophers\" as \"goe-fahs.\" Jerry (William H. Macy) is a small-time car dealer who quickly turns to deceit to conceal his ineptitude with money and investments. His eventual plan, to extort the father-in-law he loosely works for, requires him to cross paths with two lowly criminals, Carl and Gaear (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare). Unfortunately for Jerry, these two cronies hardly have a working relationship, simply looking for a payday (and perhaps a new car) from the deal. Following this whole dysfunctional team is Marge (Frances McDormand), whose simplicity is not to be misleading; this police chief is sharp in her logic, and would otherwise be quick on her feet (being 7 months pregnant slows you down a few steps).\n\nJerry's sudden divergence to a series of criminal acts is believable, and all the more intriguing, because he doesn't fit. His bewilderment concerning the fiscal demands of his hired hands is the little-league problems Don Corleone would laugh at. Jerry bites off more than he can chew trying to set up a job like he did, and repeats his mistakes trying to further extort Carl and Gaear out of their share of the profits.\n\nMarge's bewilderment is simply due to the foreign nature of this new case. She first approaches dead bodies which were \"randomly executed,\" not shot with a defined purpose. Admitting that Brainerd-ians died because they were simply \"at the wrong place at the wrong time\" is new and disturbing to Marge. When she finally catches up to the party she's chasing, Marge vocalizes her confusion: not as a ruthless detective, but more as the mother she will soon be, scolding the decisions that she simply doesn't understand.\n\nJerry and Marge provide the edge and intrigue the Coen brothers are so adept to bringing to their films. Similar to the acclaimed No Country for Old Men (2007), the two writer-director-producers don't rely on the violence and chases to keep the audience interested and occupied. The mood of Fargo follows the mood of its central characters, expounded by marvelous editing and cinematography. Even in a slow, dreary setting, the Coen's cinematic study of human greed in various forms (Jerry, Carl, Gaear) keep the film driving to its eventual conclusion, one which is perhaps expected but nonetheless insightful.\n\nFargo is pleasing in its pace and surprising depth. The simplicity of the preface leads the way to a more complex and uncharted storyline, pitting characters against one another who have equally important stories and motivations, and yet perilously opposing worldviews.\n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

            "content": "Over the past three decades, the Coen brothers have established themselves as a staple of American cinema. Not only have they written and directed some of the most quintessential works of the past thirty years, but their filmography is almost as eclectic as that of Spielberg or Kubrik. Every film that the duo makes has a different setting and atmosphere than the one before, something that I find very commendable. In 1996, the two brothers made the now-classic Fargo, a very risky entry in their diverse collection of works.\n\nFargo is a neo-noir film set in the cold state of Minnesota. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a struggling car salesman whose family is in a desperate financial situation. He hires two criminals, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, to kidnap his wife so that he can get his father-in-law to pay the two a large ransom. However, the situation becomes much trickier when the bodies of a police officer and two civillians show up by the side of the road near Brainerd, Minnesota. Police chief Marge Gunderson, played by Frances McDormand, starts taking the case under her wing, and the deeper she digs, the more Jerry Lundegaard realizes the severity of what he's gotten involved in.\n\nThere were several choices made by the Coen brothers in Fargo that were unique for a crime film. For one, the story takes place in a snow-covered, rural area of Minnesota, a far cry from the urban environment that these films are usually placed in. I also thought that it was a strange choice to reveal the origins and events of the crime in the beginning of the movie, as these details are usually saved for a big reveal during the film's conclusion. Also, for the first twenty minutes or so, we are led to believe that the film's main character is Lundegaard, but soon after the first appearance of Officer Gunderson, the film focuses much more on the police chief. All of these choices made Fargo a very unique viewing experience, and the Coen's impeccable script made these choices work together almost perfectly.\n\nThe Coen brothers have been known to hire top-notch actors for their projects, and Fargo is no exception. Frances McDormand's performance as Marge Gunderson earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress, an accolade that was well-earned. Although her Minnesota accent is quite exaggerated, this lends to the more humorous side of the film, as Fargo is, at times, a dark comedy. William H. Macy is also great as the sociopathic Jerry, who we get a strong distaste for from the first five minutes of the movie. Steve Buscemi is fantastic, as he is in many of his collaborations with the Coen brothers, and Peter Stormare does a great job as a darker foil to Buscemi's character. All of these performances were perfect for the tone of the film, which shouldn't be surprising, given the casting choices of the Coen's other movies.\n\nThe direction and editing of Fargo is great, as well. Many of the shots of the cars driving through the frozen Minnesota landscape felt very immersive. They give the viewer a sense of what it would be like to live in an area so cut off from city life, and the difficulties of solving a murder case in such an area. There were a handful of scenes involving Marge that I felt were unnecessary at first, but looking back on the entire story, I now realize that these parts were important for her slow discovery of the details of the crime. The humor in the film was cut in and out and appropriate times, a feat that many drama-comedies cannot master. The narrative was smooth, the progression of the characters seemed real, and the entire story was masterfully created.\n\nFargo might not be the best crime/neo-noir film that I've seen, but I still think that it's a masterpiece. It's creative narrative and smooth direction worked well for the unique choices made in the story, and the fantastic cast made the material very believable. I'm also quite sure that this is a film that I will enjoy even more when I view it for the second time, something that I find happens with most crime/noir films. Fargo is a great addition to the Coen's impressive collection of work, and I highly recommend it to any fans of the noir genre.",

I enjoy the characters accents, the mix of the mundane and the absurd, the snow dusted landscapes that bring me back to Saskatchewan and Alberta, the dark humor, the wholesome values of Marge Gunderson and her sweet relationship with her husband, the psychopathic violence fueled duo, Jerry Lundegaard's desperation and stupidity, and even the melancholic music. As far as flaws go, the only thing I could see criticism for would be the slow pacing. I totally understand that some people would find this movie boring. If you enjoy the things I described earlier and you are in the mood for a film that you can get lost in, I strongly recommend this movie. I know that I enjoy it with every viewing and I wouldn't change a thing. (9.5/10)",

The whole movie takes place over the course of 2-3 days and of course its a scenario where everything that can go wrong, goes wrong.

By the end of the film she is shaken by what she sees and is deeply saddened. She quietly chastises Peter Stormare's character (one of the kidnappers hired by William H.

The warm and fuzzy tone of the film didn't quite seem an appropriate match to its the grizzly plot content, but in the end, Frances McDormand's pregnant police chief character becomes the moral voice of the film that saves it for me.

The film follows a series of murders that result from a botched phony kidnapping and ransom, and follows along with Frances McDormand's profusely pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson as she tries to solve the mystery. Aside from the smart dialogue, near-perfect upper midwestern accents and evenly balanced dry mild humor with shocking violence, 'Fargo' boasts a great cast that give the performances of their lives, led by McDormand and William H. Macy, whose smarmy car salesman character Jerry Lundegaard manages to be a likable yet pitiful villain. Of course, Steve Buscemi is probably the best casting match, as his creepy appearance really fits his kidnapping, murderous character. The Coens are also able to make a barren, snowy wasteland into an interesting environment in a way that gives it as much importance as the actors within it. Also memorable is Carter Burwell's grand score, which fits the mood of the film particularly well. Really, the only thing that puts a drag on 'Fargo' is the fact that it is such a depressing story. But putting that aside, 'Fargo' is a cinematic masterpiece that should be held in high regard for its artistic characteristics.",

            "content": "When I finished watching Fargo, I could not figure out how to describe the film to other people. The consensus seems to be a crime story, with a black comedic edge. I now see Fargo as a farce in the darkest setting possible for the genre, darker than A Fish Called Wanda or Arsenic and Old Lace. It isn't groundbreaking cinema, but the fact that this extremely dark comedy pleased the old farts who hand out Academy Awards is awesome. Of course, I very much liked the film too. The setting is Minnesota, between the Twin Cities and a little town called Brainerd. Executive car sales manager Jerry (William Macy) needs money. Why? Too personal for it ever to be revealed. Through some connections, Jerry hires two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, so that her very wealthy father (Harve Presnell) pays a ransom necessary for Jerry's cause. But oh dear, antics occur when the two kidnappers shoot an officer who pulls them over, followed amusingly by killing two witnesses who watch Buscemi holding up the officer's body in a fashion almost as silly as Weekend at Bernie's. Officer Marge (Frances McDormand) of Brainerd is on the case.\n\nNot all of the jokes deal with death, so if you are sensitive to death-related jokes, I apologize for your loss. I would hate to lose the ability to laugh at death. Steve Buscemi's funny-looking character (in any state) has the funniest moments. For a kidnapper, he seems to have most trouble with minute changes or errors. That dead officer pulled Buscemi over because he had no tags on his car. Buscemi can't even drive through a toll gate without losing his shit. I won't spoil my favourite Buscemi moment, but it wholly justifies my claim that this is a farce first. Office Marge deserves attention for being my favourite character though. She talks so sweetly in her naive Minnesota-Canadian accent (lots of 'Oh yah's), yet in the professional setting, she is the toughest officer in the squad. She rips through nonsense in interrogation, and apologizes a second later if she appeared to be rude. Every second of McDormand brought great joy to my face and heart.\n\nFargo benefits from the writers, the Coen Brothers, also being the directors. Nothing is lost in translation, and so the film sits right on the edge between comedy and crime, making for engaging and especially unique cinema. Again, I did not feel challenged when laughing at the especially violent and bloody deaths or demises of characters. I can laugh or wince. It doesn't matter what happens. Fargo does not need to amuse you in order to stand out for its high quality writing. However, the viewer who laughs is probably the one who is having the greatest time and would warrant repeated screenings.",

            "content": "Plot/Summary, Filmmaking siblings Joel Coen and Ethan Coen both embraced and poked satirical fun at their Minnesotan roots with this comedy-drama-thriller that earned seven Oscar nominations, winning for Best Actress and Best Original Screenplay. Frances McDormand stars as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief whose affable, folksy demeanor masks a whip-smart mind. When a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper, Marge begins piecing together a case involving a pair of dopey would-be kidnappers, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Bergman stock player Peter Stormare). They've been hired by Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car salesman under the thumb of his wealthy, overbearing boss and father-in-law, Wade (Harve Presnell). Jerry's raised some money illegally through a petty scam he's run on General Motors and he's about to get caught. When Wade sours a business deal that could save his son-in-law's hide, the desperate Jerry hires Carl and Gaear to kidnap his wife and hold her for ransom. Things go predictably wrong and a series of murders occur, with Marge, waddling along behind her enormous belly and ever-hungering for an all-you-can-eat buffet, hot on the trail of the killers. Although the credits for Fargo state that the film is loosely based on real events, the story is entirely fictional, the claim being just an ironic jibe on the part of the Coens.\nMy Review\nIv been reading a book called The Great Movies written in 2002 by the late Roger Ebert and Fargo was one of the movies in that book that i honestly felt like watching first . I felt that this would not be a masterpiece in my tast cause it probably keep me wondering what's going to happen and i was right i don't think it's a masterpiece its what Roger Ebert's book says it is Great.\nThe Film revolves around a cop named Marge who is one of the two memorable who is looking for two crime victims.\nFargo(1996) was directed by Joel Coen,produced by Ethan Coen, co written by the brothers, and set in the Scandinavian-American upper Midwest where they grew up. It begins with the information that it is \"Based on a true story\" and ends with a disclaimer that its \"Persons and events\" are fictitious. It's fiction; \"true story\" is an ironic stylistic device.\nin the opening sequence you hear this awesome score music where you just see a car driving into a bar and you met one of the memorable character played by Steve Buscemi named Carl cause he's the criminal trying to rack up $80,000 and he is memorable because in the first thirty minutes he creates the most suspense.\nThe rest of the movie can get a little boring but to me the thing that saved me from falling asleep was the introduction of Marge the cop who keeps the movie just a little bit cooler along with Steve Buscemi as for everyone else they did great acting performances. The Dark and cold weigh down everything,and in the middle, in their warm cocoon, are chief Marge and her hubby,Norm, the painter ducks. Without them. It is a very great film that should be seen.",

I had so much fun with this film as it is really well written and the characters are so engaging.

Is this on my top ten of all time? No. But in my top twenty, hell yeah. Did I love this film? What do you think. I still to this day don't understand why this took me this long to see. It is defiantly one of the best Coen Brother films to date if not their second best. The way this film is done is so unique. Yet that doesn't change anything. The story feels fresh, even though if you just read the synopsis, you get a bit of deja vu. But no sir, this film is unique alright. What invites me into this world of filming is how dark and quirky it can be at one point and then in a space of two minutes can become something much different. Its real definition is intelligent. And lets face it who does it better than the Coen Brothers. I hear they are making a series of Fargo. But how can you remake a film that was directed by the Coen Brothers. You can't. The Coens have this special zing to them. They can make a film so intriguing that you won't ever forget about it. I believe that soon there will be an era for the Coens. That era will be called quality entertainment. Call me a fan boy, it is just for some odd reason I love quality films. Weird isn't it? \n\nFargo tells the story of Jerry Lundegaard. Jerry Lundegaard is in a financial jam and, out of desperation, comes up with a plan to hire someone to kidnap his wife and demand ransom from her wealthy father, to be secretly split between Jerry and the perpetrators. Jerry, who is not the most astute of individuals, hires a couple of real losers from the frozen northern reaches of Fargo, North Dakota for the job. Then things begin to slip from bad to worse as Jerry helplessly watches on.\n\nWhat is so redeeming about this film is the fact that it doesn't drag. It gets straight to the point. Like what I am trying to do with this review. This would make you believe that it rushes the story. But no. Amazingly this film manages to pull this whole story off, making it fairly complicated, but understandable without leaving anything out. We are talking character development, quotable dialogue and most importantly funny yet sadistic characters. Characters that we as viewers are actually interested in.\n\nOf course Frances McDormand makes this movie. Her character kind of reminds one of a 'retired and ageing' type person, but once she gets in her chief uniform you find out she is brave, clever and uses lots of cunning. Lots of aspects in this films connotes that she is weak, hurt and weathered by the force but she is actually the complete contrary. She is also very quirky. Have I mentioned that. Not sure. But all I can say is, this film delivers. And it does it brilliantly. One of my favourites and is a must see. Its also pretty funny. This film of course gets an A+.",

When a financially troubled car salesman hires and makes a deal with two people to kidnap his wife as a ruse to get his wealthy father-in-law to cough up money, you can already predict that something could go wrong, especially when these two people aren't the most professional.\r\n\r\nWhile the movie can be oddly humorous, it really adds a strange dynamic effect when coupled with its winter setting, in that it gives a sense of desolation that is reflected in Jerry Lundegaard's life and really adds a lot more weight to the morbidity that carries on and escalates throughout the beginning of the film to the end. Fargo feels like a very morbid movie to me, but to add in some of the most quirky humor really makes the movie feel very idiosyncratic in that it seems incomparable to other films, with all of its distinct characters and its very strange, cold and sterile atmosphere. While Pulp Fiction does do a good job of combining humor and morbidity, I think I have come to favor Fargo a lot more.\r\n\r\nWhat I love about Fargo is how distinct every major character is in the movie. The writing that went into him, coupled with each actor being able to breathe life into their character and giving them their own unique quirks was one of the things that kept me glued to the screen. From the mild mannered behaviors to the Minnesota accents, the characters come off very authentic in presenting a very regional film. If I would have to give a nod to any one performance in the film, it would have to be Frances McDormand. From her mild mannerisms to her unintentional humor, Marge was the foundation of the story and McDormand further accentuated that with her superb acting in that she makes her portrayal feel so authentic to its region, believable and at the utmost, human. To witness all the events in the film and to react the way she did is commendable, to say the least and I think that Marge Gunderson has got to be one of the coolest female characters on film that I have witnessed and I cannot praise the Coen brothers enough for writing such a great non-stereotypical female character.\r\n\r\nFargo may be a simple story, but I think that it's simplicity is what I really love about this film. I watched enough films from the Coen brothers to deem them as very unique in their style of telling stories that feels so different from other directors. Fargo basically sealed the deal for me. With its unique characteristics, it feels very surreal in a morbid sense. I have never described a film that way and I think that shows how special this film is. If you want to watch a film that has character, then watch 'Fargo,' because it definitely has a whole bunch of that.",

            "content": "Plot/Summary, Filmmaking siblings Joel Coen and Ethan Coen both embraced and poked satirical fun at their Minnesotan roots with this comedy-drama-thriller that earned seven Oscar nominations, winning for Best Actress and Best Original Screenplay. Frances McDormand stars as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief whose affable, folksy demeanor masks a whip-smart mind. When a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper, Marge begins piecing together a case involving a pair of dopey would-be kidnappers, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Bergman stock player Peter Stormare). They've been hired by Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car salesman under the thumb of his wealthy, overbearing boss and father-in-law, Wade (Harve Presnell). Jerry's raised some money illegally through a petty scam he's run on General Motors and he's about to get caught. When Wade sours a business deal that could save his son-in-law's hide, the desperate Jerry hires Carl and Gaear to kidnap his wife and hold her for ransom. Things go predictably wrong and a series of murders occur, with Marge, waddling along behind her enormous belly and ever-hungering for an all-you-can-eat buffet, hot on the trail of the killers. Although the credits for Fargo state that the film is loosely based on real events, the story is entirely fictional, the claim being just an ironic jibe on the part of the Coens. \nMy Review\nIv been reading a book called The Great Movies written in 2002 by the late Roger Ebert and Fargo was one of the movies in that book that i honestly felt like watching first . I felt that this would not be a masterpiece in my tast cause it probably keep me wondering what's going to happen and i was right i don't think it's a masterpiece its what Roger Ebert's book says it is Great.\nThe Film revolves around a cop named Marge who is one of the two memorable who is looking for two crime victims.\nFargo(1996) was directed by Joel Coen,produced by Ethan Coen, co written by the brothers, and set in the Scandinavian-American upper Midwest where they grew up. It begins with the information that it is \"Based on a true story\" and ends with a disclaimer that its \"Persons and events\" are fictitious. It's fiction; \"true story\" is an ironic stylistic device. \nin the opening sequence you hear this awesome score music where you just see a car driving into a bar and you met one of the memorable character played by Steve Buscemi named Carl cause he's the criminal trying to rack up $80,000 and he is memorable because in the first thirty minutes he creates the most suspense.\nThe rest of the movie can get a little boring but to me the thing that saved me from falling asleep was the introduction of Marge the cop who keeps the movie just a little bit cooler along with Steve Buscemi as for everyone else they did great acting performances. The Dark and cold weigh down everything,and in the middle, in their warm cocoon, are chief Marge and her hubby,Norm, the painter ducks. Without them. It is a very great film that should be seen.",

The salesman, Jerry Lundegaard, is anxious and unscrupulous, and hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and hold her for ransom to get her rich father to pay a large sum of money to get her back, so the criminals will get their \"fair\" share, while Jerry takes the rest for himself. Though placing his trust in the criminals is only one of the many mistakes he makes. Part of the hilarity comes directly from the stupidity of the decisions made to pull of the crime that was a foolish plan to begin. The exchanges between the characters can be both comic and sincere as the script cleverly creates messy situations that test the characters while remaining captivating and realistic.

But its not prefect, but that doesn't matter because i enjoyed every minute of it - sure there were moments that felt a bit flat but it flows at a nice breezy pace and it's never dull.\n\nIt follows 'Jerry Lundegaard' ('William H. Macy') as he plans to extort money from his farther in law by having his wife kidnapped. But the slightly ditsy chief Marge ('Frances McDormand') is on the case. A plan that you just no will fall apart but its not done the usual way it doesn't show it unraveling as such. This is something i really admire about this film it doesn't make anything obvious, set in stone there's a sort of unsure aspect to it. \n\n'Jerry' is at first a bit of a enigma you're not sure whether you like him or there's good reason for him doing this. But as the film continues it becomes apparent that he's a liar, weasel and a slimy pathetic character - made obvious by the end scene. It contains the same level of surprise that 'Scorsese' produces creating a graphic violent scene from nowhere or with an unexpected impact. \n\n'Frago' is also a pretty funny film particularly when 'Marge' is introduced and \"oh Yeah\" fits ensue. It has the same darkly comic timing and conversation that other 'Coen' films have.\n\nI really liked 'Fargo' but this not as good as iv'e been told, maybe its the high esteem it's held in - it would never live up to the lofty standards set. But i understand why it's so loved a perfectly paced film with a great performance from 'Frances McDormand' as the off-beat 'Marge'.",
