            "content": "Surprised that Kirk Lazarus didn't mention Billy Bob Thornton in Sling Blade as a part of his Tropic Thunder monologue. \n\nPerformances associated with characters that had physical tics or were mentally slow really seemed to be in vogue in the '90s, but Thornton seemed to predate most of them with Sling Blade, which he conceptualized in the late '80s before developing it into a one-man show, a short film, and ultimately this piece of acclaimed independent film (which earned Thornton an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay). The performance doesn't appeal all that special at first - a strained grimace, a croaking voice, a slight hunch - and the general trajectory of the film is relatively predictable with simple morals, but the script crafts these very long scenes that capitalize on empty space and silence (and for more than just vague artistic clout). There's also surprising attention paid to the antagonists of the film - J. T. Walsh features as a brutal serial rapist that only bookends the film but is particularly memorable, and Dwight Yoakam gives one of his finest performances as the deadbeat, alcoholic, abusive 'father' figure; the film really comes into its own during one of his drunken episodes, where his explosive anger bursts out into a full-blown fight full of threats and heady atmosphere.\n\nIt's simple and protracted, but Sling Blade has purpose and fine direction from Thornton as director, writer, and lead actor; it's the peak of his career even though his more recent work has given him more visibility as a character actor. At least Carl finally got his biscuits by the end of the film. (3.5/5)",

It's like a parable, with no nuance in the characters, a ridiculous forced love interest that isn't love, lots of Bible preaching. Towards the end the film the central character develops too much of a philosophical, talkative and good natured persona that just doesn't fit. The whole thing feels like it should be good but it's actually a very weak and immature piece of film making. Sorry.",

I believed the regional accents were all genuine, and appreciated the Southern story telling mode and the slower way of life reflected in the slowness of the film. There are not many Southern voices being expressed in movies. I also think that the main character is more on the autism spectrum than retarded because he is a whiz at fixing small motors.",

I went in with zero expectations and left the theater struck by how profound the script and cinematography had been. I also left amazed at how ugly Doyle was (played by then unknown actor and well-known country western singer Dwight Yoakam), yet I was deeply impressed at how I sympathized with a matricidal double murderer recently freed from a mental hospital  (superbly played by Billy Bob Thornton, who also wrote the script).\n\nThere are no bad turns in this film. Each actor hits the ball hard and well and does his or her job. Especially effective is Frankie, the boy who befriends the mentally disturbed Karl, whose dark past does not bother Frankie at all. After I realized how quickly the characters overlook Karl's past actions, and only Doyle antagonizes him, that I knew what the film was saying about malignant people - they create monsters, and those monsters create more.  \n\nKarl brings an end to the future monster that Frankie might become, and ends the monstrous-present of Doyle with a lawnmower blade. If Karl had a sling blade, or a kaiser blade, that might have served him well enough to the task.\n\nThis is not a film for children, but it is about the things that form some children into horrifying adults. It is worth your time if such presentations of abuse appeal to your tastes.",

It's problematic in its portrayal of domestic abuse.  In fact, the whole film is problematic.  But there's a pointless 8 minute scene of the domestic abuser playing music with his hick band.  So there's that, right?\n\nBut if you think I am being harsh on it.  If you think I am watching this old movie through a 2021 lens, let me assure you that I am not.  The acting is embarrassing.  The script is baffling.  The plot is not nearly as sweet as you remember.  This is not a good film.",

To say it’s distracting is putting it mildly. It would be more accurate to say that every sentence from his mouth was nearly enough to make me cringe. A particular phrase from Tropic Thunder comes to mind, but I won’t go there since it is offensive to even repeat that word. I think my biggest struggle was that I still saw Billy Bob Thornton inside of Karl, and I kept waiting for him to break character and admit that it was all an act. I’d love to say that it faded away over time, but right up until the final frames of the movie I was not buying into that performance. It’s a challenge, because I appreciate the backstory of Karl Childers, and I think his place in the plot of the film was compelling. Frankly, it’s a catch-22 because the film requires a person who is mentally-challenged, but there’s not exactly a long line of mentally-challenged actors (particularly ones who want to imply homicidal tendencies are normal for them.) I also had a hard time accepting the way Karl was handled by the system in Sling Blade. It stretched my suspension of disbelief a little too far. The idea that he would be released from a mental institution and expected to just go live a normal life without any assistance is ridiculous. And then for him to settle into a home life with a single mother and her young child without raising any red flags is even more insane. Despite all the problems with the film, there are definitely some scenes in Sling Blade that work well. One moment in particular that stuck out in my mind was a scene where things get heated and violent around Karl, and it feels like he is a powder keg that could explode at any moment. The tension in that scene was palpable, and I have to commend the way they kept Karl at the center of the frame so we were always focused on him, wondering if this would be the moment he turned. I was engaged by Sling Blade, and never felt bored even though it was slow-moving. It has issues that I couldn’t ignore, but it was still an effective story.",

The performances are authentic and the characters engaging; you just wanna stay with them as long as you're welcome. And that conversation at Ritter's doorstep about God not sending him to hell gave this the 5-star bump for me.",

Yet, he brings such radiant conflict to the story, working off a great dynamic between Billy Bob's subtle nuances, Dwight's slow boiling aggression and Lucas Black's startlingly energetic anger.  A \"you had to be there\" moment in cinema for sure, but ages very well..\n\n\nIt's hard to narrow down my list of great \"mentally challenged\" movies, from the likes of Forrest Gump, to Peter Sellers' brilliant performance in Being There. However, Sling Blade excels in pathos solely because of the relentlessly cruel character study of Doyle Hargraves. Doyle is a no good SOB and the movie depicts him as such, but is also presented as a self-loathing, apologetic manipulator who perfectly represents the evil that lies dormant in otherwise honest men. Sling Blade is a work of genius because it makes us, the intellectual elite of moviegoers, feel just as stupid as old Karl Childers, who can't make heads or tails of a morally complex world. That's the joke of life-none of us really can.",

Light and dark tones are masterfully balanced, offering up some of the sweetest, most heart warming scenes you could hope to find in a film & on the flip side a character so blatantly written to be as scummy, controlling & narrow minded as humanly possible plus several gruesome deaths forming the centre point of the story. It's because the light and dark is balanced so well, the movie as a whole is so effective.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton proves himself as a powerhouse. This is his rodeo through and through. The script feels lived in and informed by personal experience, the direction is as unfussy and simple as the films lead character Karl and finally, Thornton's performance commands attention yet is so understated, playing Karl with a higher degree of self awareness than you may expect.\n\nTrue, this is Billy Bob's movie, but the rest of the cast are more than game to meet the challenge of the script in creating a believable world for the characters to play in. The most jarring detail in the movie ends up being just how two tone it is. Black. White. No shades of grey. There are two characters that would fit the villain mold. They at no point show even a hint of redeeming qualities, which makes the eventual ending an expected one, not a surprise.\n\nThis is just a minor nitpick and certainly not important in the big scheme of things. Make no mistake, this film is on a hard and fast mission. It just reveals it's hand gradually over the course of 2 plus hours and makes the journey feel half as long.",

Further, the film releases his psyche which is admittedly contradicting to our mental-based perception. Comes to light, as far more sound & rational than many other \"sane\" people considered by the society.\nWhat led him to commit two murders when he was twelve? Being too sensitive and too much love for his mother;  witnessing her being corrupted by society embarked an outrageous rage, to kill her lover. After, registering his beleif and idealogy abused by society; what he has become/done it vexed him further into killing his own mother. Finally, returning home we acknowledge him in a similar position. A change has to be made to put things in order for the ones he love. Perhaps now being re-conditioned, well-balanced more open-minded and morally correct; Would he kill again? Or to put it rightly, would he turn to love and honesty again?",

Frank and Karl instantly hit it off and after some time Karl moves in and lives in Frank and his mothers garage. Karl soon learns about Franks mothers abusive boyfriend. \"Doyle\", is a drunk construction worker who doesn't tolerate anyone but himself. \n\nEarly on in the movie Frank tells his mother that he loves Karl and even quotes \"I love the way he talks\". And thats what you get when you watch the movie. He is one of the more unforgettable characters in recent memory. Not only is it his voice, there is something about his demeanor and the way he walks. He is a simple kind man at heart.Thornton does an excellent job of not only playing the character but also directing and writing the movie. There are some shots in the movie that are breathtaking and riveting. \n\nIn some ways i wish there were more people like Karl Childers in the world",

If you're looking for another Forrest Gump, this isn't the film for you - Sling Blade is a tale of Southern abuse.\nKarl Childers killed his mother and his bully with a Kaiser blade (hence the title) when he was 12 and is being let out of the state home for the first time in years. He moves into his small town he grew up in, meeting a good but troubled boy named Frankie and eventually moving in with him, having to deal with Frankie's mother's abusive alcoholic boyfriend's homicidal tendencies when drunk. The end is what I expected from the beginning, although not the way I really wanted it.\nSling Blade is an interesting movie. It's without a doubt good but like I said, it's nothing but two hours of depression. To give the ending away, Karl gives up his dreams and pursuits sought in the beginning and kills the film's antagonist in the end, making the film run on a loop. Thornton is excellent as Karl, although he's extremely different than he is in other roles. Don't expect anything mindblowing, but it's certainly good.",

It's the natural chemistry between this pair of outcasts, neither one living up to the full socially accepted norms of manhood or masculinity, that truly engages and captivates. \n\nThe screenplay, developed from the 1994 short 'Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade' (also penned by Thornton) doesn't steer from its predictable path; an audience familiar enough with this sort of fare knows where the plot is leading. This, however, is by no means a narrative flaw. Thornton has a lot to say about relationships amongst men and the need to maintain one's humanity. He presents a protagonist whose simplistic observations and contemplations reflect a paired back sense of integrity that we leave behind in childhood, and one which he is willing to go to great lengths to protect for his new friend. \n\nThere are countless evocative scenes here - all of the performances are exceptional - but Thornton's reunion with his father (Robert Duvall) is extraordinarily heartbreaking. Here, Thornton looks for acceptance (offering to mow his father's lawn) and then upon realising that it will never be given, confronts his father about the treatment of his younger brother many years ago. It's a beautifully written and photographed piece, a contemporary lesson about the protection of children.",

            "content": "Sling Blade sounded like an interesting film on the surface. I was unsure of Billy Bob Thorton's direction because All The Pretty Horses was an absolutely awful film, but considering the widespread critical praise he had received for the film I decided to watch it.\n\nThat was a great decision because Sling Blade is an example of the kind of film that is rarely made any more. Riding a budget of only $890,000, Sling Blade is of superior quality to the many generic films that ride a multi-million dollar budget and follow similar themes in a significantly more cliche manner. Elements of the story are predictable in ways, but not at any consistent rate that would cause me to deem Sling Blade a generic story. Sling Blade's story is actually very cleverly written and is packed to the brim with complicated characters, particularly protagonist Karl Childers who has a very complex way of thinking, and so regardless of his shady past he is easy to sympathise for. It's not always easy to have a single character carry an entire film from start to finish when the character is mentally disabled, because even Dustin Hoffman needed Tom Cruise in Rain Man and Sean Penn needed Dakota Fanning and Michelle Pfeiffer in I Am Sam. But Billy Bob Thorton manages to create a character so strong that he can do it all himself. \nSling Blade is Billy Bob Thorton's answer to Citizen Kane, because he serves as the writer, director and actor of it, although not the producer. Yet his contribution in every area is successful, with his efforts on the screenplay being good enough to win him the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay which comes as no surprise, because the writing talent in Sling Blade is just incredible. The script is packed with intelligence and insight to characterise its complicated characters well and establish the truth of the relationships they face. It is all very clever, and it never transcends its simplistic nature and skew off in a wrong direction. It simply stays focused on the direction of the plot at hand and lets it develop so well that it seems to be naturally happening in front of the viewer's eyes. Sling Blade contains a lot of story elements that it is likely you will have seen before in many other films. But I put it to you that few of them actually deal with the concepts as dramatically effectively and originally as Sling Blade succeeds at doing without problem. While the film is a little long, you will never feel it getting repetitive because it is packed full of a lot of surprises at every turn which should satisfy your lust for intelligent cinema as well as your way of thinking about the concept of somebody with a mental illness.\nAnd the quality of Billy Bob Thorton's direction is at some of his best in Sling Blade. As well as crafting the film into an exceptionally memorable tale of woe, sadness and mental instability, Sling Blade features a memorable visual style. While the budget is limited, it doesn't limit the quality of the film since the cinematography is all very good and atmospheric. And the production design, costumes and language are all appropriate to the time setting in Arkansas, and while even though the colour palette is rather monochromatic it's all still full of memorably imagery. But the most visually appealing element is Billy Bob Thorton's lead performance.\nBilly Bob Thorton's lead performance is just incredible. The role of playing a mentally disabled figure like Karl Childers is a role reserved only for the most talented of actors, like Sean Penn in I Am Sam or Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. He is put into the role of carrying a whole story on his shoulders as an actor, and it takes no time before audiences see the true endeavour of his skill as an actor. He conveys all the mental anguish that Karl Childers is full of  flawless talent, and a performance of this strength and calibre seems routine for him. It's really hard to describe, but I was thoroughly blown away by his performance, mostly due to the captivating nature of the physicality in Billy Bob Thorton's performance. No matter how weird his character is, he always emits a friendly presence which he proves to use as a connection to other characters. Really, the entire story of Sling Blade is built around the complex nature of the world in the time it is set and how Karl Childers deals with it all, and thanks to a career-best performance of Billy Bob Thorton, it is a constantly immense success. Billy Bob Thorton's incredible performance truly has to be seen to be believed, because his strength is unbelievable and no other actor in the film can match the immense talent he shows off as Karl Childers.\nLucas Black gives strong performance as well, since in his youth he captures a certain shattered innocence which feels somewhat mended the more his character engages with Billy Bob Thorton. The relationship they share is a mix of father and brotherly friendship, so its complicated of its own right. And there is a lot of spirit that comes from between them which becomes the key aspect of the film that makes it compelling in its exploration of multiple characters. Lucas Black gives a serious and powerful performance, one of the greatest of his career. \nRobert Duvall's cameo appearance was an effective one, and it was interesting to see Jim Jarmusch make an appearance for a second.\n\nSo Sling Blade is a simple and yet riveting film with a lot of intelligence put into exploring its complex characters, and at the heart of the film is dedicated power from Billy Bob Thorton at his greatest talent as director, writer and actor which earned him a well deserved Academy Award from one of two nominations.",

Billy Bob Thornton, who also wrote and directed this indie, gives an amazing, one-of-a-kind acting job that stnads easily as the best performance of his career.  Seeing him in real life interviews and in other movies makes \"Sling Blade\" even more impressive since the part is so completely different from his everyday demeanor.\r\n\r\nThornton plays Karl Childers, a mental handicapped man who has spent most of his life in a mental institution.  At the age of 12 he murdered his mother and her lover with a sling blade.\r\n\r\nHe is now much older and is deemed cured by the state.  He returns to the same town he knew as a child, but everyone is different now and it is a struggle to find a place for himself there.  He befriends a young boy named Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and it isn't long until the boy's mother has given Karl a place to stay.  Doyle (Dwight Yoakam), her boyfriend, is a mean spirited redneck and both Karl and Frank become the target of his aggression.\r\n\r\nThe story is well told and captures the south and its people very well.  Lucas Black, Yoakam, and John Ritter all give good support.  It is, however, Thornton in his Oscar nominated role who is most commendable in his difficult role.  He also won Best Screenplay Oscar.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/SlingBlade_zps1a2efc23.jpg[/IMG]",

And the fact of the matter is that this transformation is simple as hell, sticking your jaw out and changing your voice.  Simple, yet highly effective.  What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said in the last 17 years since it came out?  First things first, I've owned this movie for years now and today was the first time watching.  I have the special edition director's cut, which means that the version I watched runs about 2 and 20-some odd minutes long.  And not for one second does this movie ever drag or feel like it's running for too long.  So that's definitely a positive.  The movie tells the story of Karl Childers, who's been in a mental institute for over 25 years for having murdered his wife and her lover, is released and the friendships he develops with a boy, his mother and pretty much everyone he meets, other than Doyle.  I thought the writing was excellent and while all characters are really well-written, it doesn't make Karl look like a muppet.  He's not someone to be pitied or mocked, he's actually a very kind-hearted, gentle and insightful man.  The fact that he did murder his mother and lover isn't really even in your mind once you get to know this man.  But, at first, when you meet Karl and he explains to the interviewer how he managed to find himself in that situation, the way this scene is set-up makes Karl sound horrifying.  The scene is well-shot and taut.  I do think that you can pretty much, right from the beginning of the film, figure out how the film is gonna end.  If you've watched more than 20 movies in your life then you'll know.  That doesn't mean that the movie isn't compelling, because it's a movie that commands your attention from beginning to end.  I must also make special mention of Dwight Yoakam's performance, I thought he was a top-notch asshole in this movie.  But, at the same time, he really isn't as bad as you'd have thought.  I mean yea, he is a drunk and he yells a lot, but he was never physically abusive, outside of one shoving incident.  He is an absolute jerk to Frank though, and he definitely needed to be removed from the equation so Frank and his mother could live happily without having to worry that Doyle was going to go after them.  Did he deserved to be murdered?  I don't know, it's a moral grey area.  I didn't feel horribly sad that Doyle was murdered, but did he deserve it?  That's where the dilemma comes in.  Another part of the movie I was surprised at was the amount of comedy that was actually in the film.  It's not hilarious, it's only a few scenes here and there, but they were a welcome surprise.  The comedic highlight would have to be when Doyle and his band return to the house from buying alcohol and they're discussing the band, music, lyrics, etc.  So I loved this movie, even if it is a little predictable.  This is an excellent movie with a heartfelt story.",

Fading in on the inside of a sleepy mental hospital day room, the atmosphere feels silent, the carnal chatter of a fellow inmate buzing like a bug, an incessant fly on the wall. And then comes the monologue (oh, the monologue) delivered by Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thorton) on why, as a child, he in fear offed two lovers in coitus, one of whom happened to be his mother. It's in stark contrast to the rest of the film's medium shots -- his speech is seen from overhead, like ample evidence being left on God's voicemail not as to why Karl was just in his cause, but how he's bettered since then.\n\nThe directorial debut of Billy Bob Thorton, \"Sling Blade\" starts out operatic, the monster coming home, and I found myself awaiting Karl to break, for conflict to arise as he reverts back to his blood simple ways. \"Blade\" very much has a foil -- guy gets out of lockup, guy struggles to keep it together, goes back to the ward -- but it's the slow, methodical nature of it that drives the movie -- and the excellent Freddie Quell-type twig-thin hunchback of Karl, played beautifully by Thorton -- deeper. It brings the movie to a psychological level by shaking the habitual of serial killer films, and of Thorton the celebrity himself. \"The Master\" in its lyricism, \"Psycho\" in its small-town panic and \"South Park\" in its humor, \"Sling Blade\" is a grab-bag of all of these without losing its edge. In its congenial wisdom and mannered trepidation, it's almost like a down-home horror movie for the whole family.",

            "content": "The quiet atmosphere in this film captures the South in all its loneliness and quiet darkness. The small town mentality is endearing and refreshingly good spirited but is also shown to be unaware of itself. Billy Bob Thornton's seemingly effortless portrayal of a mentally disturbed  man is good. That goes without saying. How his character perfectly disrupts the dynamics of a Southern town is more of a revelation. His character is seemingly a foil for everyone, revealing their true nature and also serving as a commentary on the different ways in which mentally challenged people are treated. The town's wackiness, however, makes it clear that everyone has some sort of oddness to them. Thornton's character, Karl Childers, initially seems to be utterly out of touch with what is happening around him. Karl, in reality, sees what is happening more than most and is willing to do something about it in the end. He serves as a judge of humanity. His heart beats with goodness, however, and it becomes clear that Karl is not immune to the judgement he inflicts on those he deems to be evil. He seems to be remorseful of the murder of his mother. \n\nThe supporting cast is great, too, and even though this is Thornton's film, the town is given a life of its own. Much time is spent on developing the characters that populate this film. Because otherwise this would just be an Oscar bait showcase for Thornton's acting skills. I respect him because he has the maturity and skill to avoid that.\n\nThe only disappointing aspect of this film is the climax. It seems very inevitable and isn't as pulse poundingly satisfying as the story warrants. The initial scene where Karl describes the murder of his mother in a room literally bathed in darkness is eerie and foreboding. That scene is still exhilarating but it promises a showdown it doesn't deliver on. But that is a minor qualm with this film. In fact, the climax's inevitability makes it so that the audience isn't distracted by  what is going to happen and instead focuses on the fine performances on display. The character interactions are natural. The themes consistently engaging.",

            "content": "This is a top 5 favorite for me, and an absolutely phenomenal movie that I have watched over and over again.  Billy Bob Thornton became a famous indie film star after he wrote the screenplay for the film, and he directed it.  He plays the protagonist of the story Carl Childers.  Carl is a mentally retarded man who just got released from the mental hospital.  His parents abused him when he was young, and the disowned him.  The forced him to sleep out in a shed, and his mother would feed him regularly.  He got put in the hospital because he caught his mother having sex with another man, and then he killed them both with a sling blade.  He is a gentle man who you would be surprised to hear that he killed somebody, because he just seems so innocent.  He has a thick accent, and talks in a funny way.  He mostly doesn't make eye contact with people unless he has to say something really serious.  He is a very interesting character that is retarded, but smart at the same time.  He has certain skills like he can repair any kind of engine.\n\nWhen he gets out he meats a boy named Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) who takes an interest in him, and they become good friends.  Carl goes to live with Frank and his mother, which seams like it would be perfect for him.  Franks mother has an abusive boyfriend named Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam) who is nasty as it gets.  He is homophobic, hates kids, and Carl.  It is a stereotypical abusive relationship where the mother won't leave the man, because after every incident he always comes back and is really nice.  Plus he threatened to kill her if she left him. Doyle is vicious but he is also really funny.  He has a ton of really awful, but hilarious lines like \"Carl is likely to bust a spring he is already off balance.\"  The film has a lot of humor, and sadness in it at the same time.  The scene when Doyle goes crazy when he has his band get together at the house is hilarious, but really awful when you think of it.\n\nFrank is a sad kid, but a great one.  Lucas Black did such a great job portraying him.  He seemed almost like Jim from To Kill A Mockingbird.  A lot of the scenes in this film are ones that would be really hard to act out, and he is just fantastic in every scene.  His father killed himself because he thought he couldn't take care of him and his mom.  He looks at Carl as a father now, and they form a really close bond with each other.  He is very innocent, but naïve.  Carl told him that he got put in a hospital because he \"Killed some folks\" and tells him to come by someday to say hi.  Carl does, and they go to the store that his mother works at.  Frank tells his mother part of Carl's situation and leaves out the part of being a killer and he just got out of the hospital.  The whole thing was a very naïve and innocent thing to do not knowing that you just tricked your own Mother to letting a man who just got out of the institution live in your house.\n\nVaughan Cunningham (John Ritter) is the man who Franks mother works for.  He is an openly gay man, who is very feminine, but a really nice guy.  He has to keep his love life private, because in a small town any thing about his sex life will get around.  He doesn't leave because of Frank and his mother, and his concern for them with Doyle around.  Doyle harasses him, and picks on him for being gay.  He knows what a destructive force Doyle is so he worries all of the time.  John Ritter plays that role perfectly, and like all the other characters in the film pulls off some really tough and emotional acting.  His role did add a lot to the story, and he was probably the most likeable guy in the film.\n\nDoyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam) is a stereotypical redneck, abusive man.  He always says things like \"I'm hurting\" to manipulate her into feeling bad for him, and hoping she will take him back.  Reality is that he isn't really hurting he is just insane, and a manipulative guy.  He cheats on her, and tricks her all the time.  He does have a ton of funny lines however.  That is the only reason why you can stand him.  But you still hate him.\n\nA lot of this film uses nature, and music.  The music is very peaceful, and so is nature.  They both add a lot to the film, but the music does the most.  When you really do notice the music that means that it is really good, and that it is great for the scene.    Especially at the end.  The music changes as the film goes along, and Carl changes a lot too.  In the end Carl is a changed man, and he has peace of mind now.  The opening scene and the closing scene are the same except you see a total change in Carl in the ending scene.  I will not say exactly what it was, but this is an unbelievable movie with amazing character development, drama, acting, dialogue, and just a fantastic script.",

Thinking he was doing something bad  to her Carl Pulled  our a sling blade and whacked him in the head with it killing him. He found out his mom was not upset over what this guy was doing  and she started yelling at him and he hits her over the head with the sling blade and kills her too. Carl really isn't the murdering type he is a guy that  im not going to say the r  word becuase it is not nice but he has special needs or mentally handicapped so they put him the mental institute instead of jail. Twenty five years later he gets released and goes back to his hometown. and the doctor that took care of him let him stay at his house because Carl had nowhere to go. And the doctor hooked him up with a job. So Carl is walking around town and runs into a kid who he ends up helping him bring his laundry back to his house. Carl becomes friends with this kid and his mom and ends up moving in with them. The mom has a boyfriend who is a real jerk and is abusive who is played by Dwight yoakam. There is another guy who has feelings for the mom too but he is gay  named Vaughn who is played by John Ritter. Carl feels bad for the kid  who says he is a good friend and mom and kind of wants to hang around to protect them. He tells the mom about \"his past\" and she was pretty cool about it.  He knows they are  in danger with the boyfriend around. That's all  I'm going say about the story I don't want to spoil it.  Billy bob Thornton who directed this  also starred in it of course as Carl who I thought did a marvelous job. I'm not really a huge fan of his  but this he was great in. He had the stance and walk And facial features down right of someone who is mentally handicapped. Dwight yoakam was pretty good as the crude and abusive boyfriend. And John Ritter I always enjoy watching. Such a Shame he died so young. R.i.p. John. I can see why this movie got all the acalades it got and it deserves it. \nIf you have not watched this i would go out now and find it and rent it. I don't know if redbox carrys it but I even heard Netflix has it if you get it. Heck I would even buy it because it is defiantly worth the money. It is defiantly worth the two hours and fifteen minutes  of watching.",

            "content": "A strange yet ultimately fascinating modern masterpiece. In all its simplicity, this is one deep movie that is much more than it appears to be, which \"I reckon is just fine to me, mmhmm\".\n\nKarl Childers, a mildly retarded man, has spent his life at an institution since the age of 12 after killing his mother and a man who she slept with -- and who frequently abused Karl. Decades later, he is released from the institution after being deemed well and out into the real world he goes, having learned his lesson. He works as a mechanic, befriends a younger child and his widowed mother, and is taken in by them. However, he must deal with the mother's abusive and depraved boyfriend...\n\nBilly Bob Thornton delivers an accomplished performance as Karl onscreen, giving us a memorable and intriguing character that transcends his role. Offscreen, he is equally accomplished in the writing and directing departments, with a thoughtful, meditative script and subtle, brilliant direction to boot. The rest of the cast, especially the likes of Lucas Black, Dwight Yoakam, and John Ritter, is natural, lending a great support to Thornton's one-man show. As slow as it may be, this movie is never dull. Ha ha. There's plenty of off-beat emotion and Southern warmth to elegantly contrast with its brutal honesty and unsettling subject matter. Unusual but great music as well as picturesque cinematography help establish an atmosphere that works like a charm.\n\nThere's hardly any fault in this film for me. Except that this movie isn't quite as powerful as it could've been, primarily in the last act. It can be a tough viewing for some not only for its pace, but because of what occurs offscreen.\n\nAll in all, \"Sling Blade\" is an extraordinary achievement for Billy Bob Thornton as well as for cinema in the 90's. Already, as a result of its great ambience and compelling material, this movie is one that'll be worthing watching over and over again.",

            "content": "It sounds like a film about the boys in the 'hood; was written and directed by its lead, Billy Bob Thornton; and has played in, probably, all of thirty-seven theaters across the United States.\nIt's \"Slingblade\". And it also happens to be an extraordinarily original film- quite possibly the best American film released this year.\nWith the most eclectic collection of nominees in the history of the Academy Awards, it's no mistake that this homemade film is up for two awards (Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay.)\nThe story is deceptively simple: after a near lifetime behind the protective confines of the state mental hospital, Karl Childers (Thornton) is being released. Mildly retarded, Karl not only has to adjust to a strange new world with the resources of an ex-con, but he has to do it with the stigma of a handicap.\nWith only the assistance of the facility's good-hearted director, Karl manages to make a place for himself fixing small engines in the tiny town of Millsburg, where he grew up. Providence also links him with a young boy named Frank, who is in aching need of a father figure.\nGiven shelter in their garage by Frank's sympathetic mother Linda, Karl begins to emerge from his shell of social uncertainty, but must also face the cruel tauntings of Linda's redneck boyfriend, Doyle.\nA man battling with his own demons of prejudice and inadequacy, Doyle has nothing but contempt for Karl, Frank and Linda's gay friend Von. Displaying a disturbing pattern of abuse and contriteness, it's only a matter of time until Doyle will precipitate a confrontation that will forever change everyone's lives.\nPut together on a shoe-string, Thornton has drawn on his considerable talents to make this film as compelling and personal as is possible. When today's independent productions succeed, it is often in spite of themselves; their rough-edged technical qualities making viewing an exercise in stoic tolerance.\nWhile obviously limited in its technical resources, \"Slingblade\" manages to not only overpower its limitations, it uses them to its full advantage. The often dimly lit camerawork fits in Karl's world, where the corners of his mind are fighting to hold back the darkness and grasp the more complicated details of life. Instead of the seamless omnipresence that a gliding camera would have given, the film's more noticeable camerawork works like the personal point of view of the audience, giving one the sense of being physically present and immediately involved in the dynamics of the situation.\nWith some reputation within the industry already (Thornton co-wrote last year's \"A Family Thing\"), Thornton has managed to assemble an incredibly talented cast. His own performance is nothing short of perfect; with a detail and consistency that defy disbelief. Likewise, the remainder of the cast -whether well-known or not- seem as real and vulnerable as if we were watching a documentary.\nThough fortunate enough to have such familiar names as Robert Duvall, John Ritter and Dwight Yoakum, these are not glamour roles, but solid performances that simply blend into the tapestry of the film.\nRated R for language, implied violence and some sexually oriented dialogue, the film is mature, but never gratuitous.\nPortraying the unsentimental flip side of \"Forrest Gump\", Karl Childers distills our view of the world to the deceptively complex issues of right and wrong. It's an unforgettable experience, and one that likely won't be achieved again soon by a studio release.",

I thought that the film is one of Thornton's greatest films, and he proves that he is able to take on a more serious role. The film is wonderful and manages to be a memorable film. Sling Blade boasts some powerful performances from its cast, and it's what makes this film stand out. If you're in the mood for a stellar drama film, then give this film a look. With a brilliant cast, great story and great directing, Sling Blade is a must see for serious film fans. This is an almost perfect film, and with performances that really stand out, Sling Blade has stood the test of time after all these years.

Although my friends and I love to mimic Karl's voice and do quotes for laughs, there's actually very little to laugh about in this southern gothic drama. Whatever you think of Billy Bob Thornton, Slingblade is an unforgettable masterpiece; the writing, Karl's speech and walk, as well as the rest of the ensemble are some of the greatest in history. Maybe most significant is that although I've never met anyone resembling Karl Childers, the whole film has a frighteningly believable aura to it. \r\n\r\nWhile Thornton's Karl Childers is obviously the central character, other actors contributed mightily to the overall success of the film. The addition of John Ritter and Dwight Yokam to the cast provides both mainstream appeal and tremendous depth to the story. Even the lesser characters, James Hampton as Jerry- the administrator at the \"nervous hospital\", Natalie Canerday as Linda, and Rick Dial as \"Bill Cox add distinctive local color and realism to the ensemble. Lucas Black as Frank Wheatley is probably my other favorite. The surrogate father-son relationship creates an unforgettable emotional attachment, cementing this film as so much more than a usual small town oddball story. The stark contrast between Karl's relationship with his father and the one he develops with Frank provides the emotional centerpiece to this both shocking and tender film.  It's a masterpiece of southern storytelling from Thornton's twisted genius. \r\n\r\nBilly Bob Thornton contributes this masterpiece to the finest southern literary tradition. I am reminded of a quotation by the eminent author Flannery O'Connor, \"Whenever I'm asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one.\" The slow-moving, mentally challenged Karl stands in contrast to Doyle, Karl's father, and the sex criminal inmate. Slingblade won the Academy Award for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay- Thornton adapted his own earlier work, and Thornton was nominated for Best Actor.",

            "content": "This is a top 5 favorite for me, and an absolutely phenomenal movie that I have watched over and over again.  Billy Bob Thornton became a famous indie film star after he wrote the screenplay for the film, and he directed it.  He plays the protagonist of the story Carl Childers.  Carl is a mentally retarded man who just got released from the mental hospital.  His parents abused him when he was young, and the disowned him.  The forced him to sleep out in a shed, and his mother would feed him regularly.  He got put in the hospital because he caught his mother having sex with another man, and then he killed them both with a sling blade.  He is a gentle man who you would be surprised to hear that he killed somebody, because he just seems so innocent.  He has a thick accent, and talks in a funny way.  He mostly doesn't make eye contact with people unless he has to say something really serious.  He is a very interesting character that is retarded, but smart at the same time.  He has certain skills like he can repair any kind of engine.\n\nWhen he gets out he meats a boy named Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) who takes an interest in him, and they become good friends.  Carl goes to live with Frank and his mother, which seams like it would be perfect for him.  Franks mother has an abusive boyfriend named Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam) who is nasty as it gets.  He is homophobic, hates kids, and Carl.  It is a stereotypical abusive relationship where the mother won't leave the man, because after every incident he always comes back and is really nice.  Plus he threatened to kill her if she left him. Doyle is vicious but he is also really funny.  He has a ton of really awful, but hilarious lines like \"Carl is likely to bust a spring he is already off balance.\"  The film has a lot of humor, and sadness in it at the same time.  The scene when Doyle goes crazy when he has his band get together at the house is hilarious, but really awful when you think of it.\n\nFrank is a sad kid, but a great one.  Lucas Black did such a great job portraying him.  He seemed almost like Jim from To Kill A Mockingbird.  A lot of the scenes in this film are ones that would be really hard to act out, and he is just fantastic in every scene.  His father killed himself because he thought he couldn't take care of him and his mom.  He looks at Carl as a father now, and they form a really close bond with each other.  He is very innocent, but naïve.  Carl told him that he got put in a hospital because he \"Killed some folks\" and tells him to come by someday to say hi.  Carl does, and they go to the store that his mother works at.  Frank tells his mother part of Carl's situation and leaves out the part of being a killer and he just got out of the hospital.  The whole thing was a very naïve and innocent thing to do not knowing that you just tricked your own Mother to letting a man who just got out of the institution live in your house.\n\nVaughan Cunningham (John Ritter) is the man who Franks mother works for.  He is an openly gay man, who is very feminine, but a really nice guy.  He has to keep his love life private, because in a small town any thing about his sex life will get around.  He doesn't leave because of Frank and his mother, and his concern for them with Doyle around.  Doyle harasses him, and picks on him for being gay.  He knows what a destructive force Doyle is so he worries all of the time.  John Ritter plays that role perfectly, and like all the other characters in the film pulls off some really tough and emotional acting.  His role did add a lot to the story, and he was probably the most likeable guy in the film.\n\nDoyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam) is a stereotypical redneck, abusive man.  He always says things like \"I'm hurting\" to manipulate her into feeling bad for him, and hoping she will take him back.  Reality is that he isn't really hurting he is just insane, and a manipulative guy.  He cheats on her, and tricks her all the time.  He does have a ton of funny lines however.  That is the only reason why you can stand him.  But you still hate him.\n\nA lot of this film uses nature, and music.  The music is very peaceful, and so is nature.  They both add a lot to the film, but the music does the most.  When you really do notice the music that means that it is really good, and that it is great for the scene.    Especially at the end.  The music changes as the film goes along, and Carl changes a lot too.  In the end Carl is a changed man, and he has peace of mind now.  The opening scene and the closing scene are the same except you see a total change in Carl in the ending scene.  I will not say exactly what it was, but this is an unbelievable movie with amazing character development, drama, acting, dialogue, and just a fantastic script.",

The story is so simple but has all of the characteristics of a good drama: acting, character development, and emotion. It reminded  me of Forrest Gump a little, both about a guy who isn't too bright but shows his wits through his actions. Billy Bob Thornton completely transformed himself for this role so impressively that he is almost unrecognizable. Karl Childers is only a character that could've been written and acted for my a true master. It's amazing how Thornton managed to switch from acting as Karl back to directing in every shot. This seems like the kind of character an actor would need to stay in and prepare greatly for, and it really shows in Thornton's performance. He totally deserved the Oscar nomination. Watching Karl and his young friend Frank walk and have the simplest conversation is interesting because the characters are interesting. The way it's filmed is unique as well: most of the cuts are excessively long which also shows how much preparation these actors had to do. Thornton managed to take on the three biggest components in making a movie: directing, writing, and starring and he did all three masterfully. Sling Blade is a total marvel to experience, it's beauty and genius shown through every line and every scene.",

No, I guess not though because I'd notice him in anything he did.

            "content": "Sling Blade marked the directorial debut of country singer turned actor Billy Bob Thornton, who also authored the script (expanding George Hickenlooper's acclaimed short Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade) and stars in the picture. Thornton plays Karl Childers, a mildly retarded man who spent most of his life in a mental institution. When Karl was a boy, he was severely mistreated by his abusive father (Robert Duvall). At age 12, Karl found his mother having intercourse with a man who tormented him endlessly; he snapped, flew into a homicidal rage, and killed both individuals by decapitating them. Years later, as a middle-aged man, Karl is deemed harmless to society and released from the mental institution where he resides. Karl says he has learned his lesson and adds, \"I reckon I got no reason to kill no one.\" He returns to the town of his boyhood, where he's befriended by Frank (Lucas Black), the son of a widowed mother who sees the eccentric but open-hearted Karl as a kindred spirit. Karl also gets a job at a fix-it shop and resides in the backroom, until Frank's mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), takes a liking to Karl and lets him stay with them. However, Karl also meets Doyle (Dwight Yoakam), Linda's boyfriend, a sadistically cruel, narrow-minded drunk who tosses casual abuse at Frank, treats Linda like dirt, and mocks Karl endlessly.\r\n\r\nStarring, Billy Bob Thornton, Dwight Yoakam, J.T. Walsh, John Ritter, Lucas Black , Natalie Canerday , James Hampton , Robert Duvall.\r\n\r\nDirected by Billy Bob Thornton himself.\r\n\r\nNominated for 2 Oscars, Best Lead Actor and Adapted Screenplay it won for Adapted Screenplay. it was written, directed and acted by Billy Bob Thornton. a huge hit with Critics and Indie lovers.\r\n\r\nwell here comes a movie that i thought i will love it just for the acting performance, i heard and saw this totally changed Thornton in trailers and i was like this is extraordinary. what i didn't expected was that this movie will touch me so much.\r\n\r\nthis is actually one of the best movie i have ever seen. so well crafted and memorable. an instant classic. its going in my 100 movies to see before you die list for sure. i didn't thought i will love it so much but i did. right from the first shot when he says his story to the end the movie kept me interested, involved and just totally absorbed in it. a perfectly made human drama with human written all over it. it is like a perfectly told tale and a kind of stories that southern people say you know it has that kind of hold. one of the best movies based on South with no cowboys violence in it. it is poetic and quite good and storytelling at its best.\r\n\r\nthis is the story of a mentally impaired man who is released from a psychiatric hospital who was there since he killed his mother and her lover when he was young. he meets a child and is friend with him finds job and live. but how will this world react and how will he takes it? will he return to that same old place again? watch it. this movie reminded me of Edward Scissorhands in that way.\r\n\r\npitch perfect and indeed one of the best Adapted screenplays ever. mindblowingly written with 0% flaws. i loved the writing. story was told good with good direction. i wish it got more nods. now Billy Bob Thornton did a fantastic job with this movie. his performance is one of its kind, superbly acted. overall everyone did a nice job but billy's performance was excellent.\r\n\r\nbrilliant character study with a movie worth watching.",

Sling Blade catapults into cinematic greatness and ranks with classics such as \"Rain Man\", \"Of Mice And Men\" and \"Scent Of A Woman\".  This one is intense folks, and it's hard not to fall in love with the central character that Billy Bob Thornton portrays.  An intensely dramatic revenge story with a kick, Sling Blade is pure mastery, a true classic in contemporary filmmaking.  A hard-hitting, truly touching, completely marvelous and absolutely stunning work of pure genius from everyone involved.  It's not as disturbing as everyone makes it out to be, but with that being said, the tone of the film is very dark and quite brooding but also cheerful and uplifting, the central character is just a complete mystery.  A truly wonderful drama that instantly touches your heart that keeps you engaged and on the edge of your seat for the entire runtime.  Stunning, original, brilliant, emotional, funny, violent and legendary, this film has something for absolutely everyone.  It's a tale of friendship, loyalty, respect and the human condition, what to do in the face adversity and the horrors that verbal and physical abuse can cause.  An all-around work of brilliance that goes down as one of my personal favorites of all time.  A hard-hitting emotional knockout of seriously epic proportions.  I very highly recommend this film to all, even children, but with parental guidance of course.\n       The acting in this film is legendary.  Billy Bob Thornton's performance as Carl is one of the greatest single acts of all time, a legendary and masterful performance by a man of pure talent.  Thornton carries the entire film on his back and commands the screen with powerful authority.  Dwight Yoakam gives a brilliant performance, easily the best of his career.  Lucas Black gives a young breakout performance and the late John Ritter was awesome as well.  A great example of all-around genius.",

His character is not over the top. Karl is scary but also cute at the same time. He's kind and would not hurt a fly. He's that kind and hard working person that there's no time for in the world.

There are two elements that make Sling Blade a must-see experience: the acting and the story.  Aside from Billy Bob Thornton's performance completely redeeming him as an actor for me, Dwight Yoakam will really emotionally engage you through the maddenning way that he speaks to the main characters.  Additionally, Lucas Black proves to be a very effective child actor (as the entire film hinges on his chemistry with Thornton), Ritter adds another layer, and Robert Duvall completes the cast with an unexpected cameo.  This is paired with Thornton's vibrant screenplay, perfectly written as a vehicle for him to show off his raw acting skill.  The dialogue between him and Black is incredibly moving and the film's concept is very unique.  The first 17 minutes are actually a condensed version of the original short film, \"Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade.\"  To be honest, I much preferred the original 25 minute short to this film's intro and I would definitely recommend watching the short and then beginning this feature-length version at the 17 minute mark.

            "content": "During Christmastime (I think) my family went to go see True Grit. As we left the theater we were all saying what we thought about the film and my dad said that he liked the film a lot and he thought that Jeff Bridges did an excellent job. But he also thought that he sounded pretty much exactly like Billy Bob Thorton in Sling Blade. He asked me if I had seen it and I said no so he told me that this film is the one that I should watch next. Well, it's been a few months but I've watched it now and that's what counts I suppose. \r\n\r\nActing/Characters: A lot of actors (far too few these days) have one role that is their \"just take everything that you know that they are capable of and just ignore it\" role. This is that performance for Billy Bob Thorton. He did an absolutely amazing job. it makes you wonder, why hasn't he given us a performance this good since? Where is the BBT who made this film? I want him back. The rest of the cast does an excellent job but it is Thorton who does the best. He had to, he carried the whole film. He did amazingly well at it. He got a Best Actor Oscar nom for it too. 9/10\r\n\r\nPlot: The plot, and indeed the whole tone of the film, is simple. It's a simple plot. It doesn't need to be anything more. It can be a tad predictable but that doesn't much take away from the film I reckon. I knew nothing going into this film. I think that is best. I bet that people who haven't heard about this film up until now are guessing about what kind of film this is. You're probably wrong. It isn't anything that I have seen before but it feels somehow familiar. The type of character that BBT plays is certainly nothing new, but in a way it is. It's kinda hard to explain you just have to see it. it is a highly enjoyable plot that kept my interest throughout. 9/10\r\n\r\nScreenplay: BBT won the Academy Award for best Adapted Screenplay for this film. It's another aspect that is \"We know he can because of this film so why doesn't he?\" The screenplay was like the rest of the film: simple. But it worked extremely well for the film. The main character's lines were pretty repetitive, but considering the character he had it was 100% justified. If the character talked with the intelligence level of Stephen Hawking, the film wouldn't work (and would be a drastically different film to boot). It benifited the film very nicely and I think that BBT deserved the win. 9/10\r\n\r\nLikableness: I highly enjoyed it. I would suggest this film to anyone who has not seen it. It will alter your perceptions of what BBT is capable. 2 Oscar nominations for Screenplay (won) Actor (Lost to Geoffrey Rush for Shine). He deserved them both (the noms at least. I haven't seen Shine). it was an incredibly well crafted film that is an under-rated film. Not too many people I've know have heard of this one. If a lot of you have I'll remove that line. it was a well crafted film that I would highly suggest. 9/10\r\n\r\nFinal score: 36/40 90% (N) \r\n\r\n\r\nMan, I worked on this one. I wrote half of the review the first time and then accidentally closed out of the page, I wrote the entire review the second time and then accidentally went to another page. This is my third attempt at the review. \r\n\r\nTRIVIA TIME: 1. Fellow independent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch appears as the \"Frosty Kreme\" worker in the beginning. His name tag reads \"Deke\", the name of the film's Electrical Best Boy. \r\n\r\n2. In order to make his walk more awkward and consistent, Billy Bob Thornton placed crushed glass in his shoes. \r\n\r\n3. Billy Bob Thornton requested that no red be seen in this movie stating : \"I don't like to see red in a movie, unless it's about the Revolutionary War\". \r\n\r\n4. Billy Wilder advised Billy Bob Thornton to write a screenplay where he could exploit his less than perfect features. \r\n\r\n5. Co-stars J.T. Walsh and John Ritter both died of a heart attack at the age of 54.",

Karl is allowed to stay at Frank's house in the garage with his mother's permission.  However, there are complications as Frank's mother Linda has an abusive boyfriend.  While this movie is interesting overall, and Billy Bob Thornton did an excellent job in his acting role, I found the majority of this film to be quite slow moving.",

But before Karl kills him, he gives him a warning and Doyle just sits there doing nothing!  What I find hard to believe is that Doyle whose as sane as they come doesn't try to kill him first that if he ever felt threatened by Karl, he would try to kill him first whose only crime was that he was supposed to be as abusive which is not even that bad especially people living in the Southern US!  And after Doyle is dead, does Karl get locked up and back to the institution again or is this murder even acknowledged at all, and the answer is no.  It was just like any other day!  Throughout the whole film, it was just a huh- what just happened!  And as a realist- despite some smart dialogue on some parts of this film, because I watched this with famil with only one person chckling a little, this film delves into total uncredibility as it progressed!\r\n\r\n2 out of 4",

Sling Blade was just way to awesome and is one of the best dramas I've ever seen. The story is captivating, original in my opinion, and will take you on a journey into the mind of a man who aims to do right by the people he loves.

After being released, he meets up with good willed folks who are being terrorised by a redneck hillbilly and the rest is pretty much guessable. Here is where the gripes come in, Sling Blade is crawling slow, which is good for character developing movies which Sling Blade is supposed to be, but that is hardly what one gets here as Thornton's retarded character can be read like a book after 5 minutes of running time. Sure the sympathy level is high all the time, but Thornton's character alone cannot carry the epic lasting 2h 20min all alone, he becomes repeating. There are good scenes all over the movie, but the movie is missing that something. Big Plot twist is not the answer here in slow paced movie like this, but my guess is that much more time tuning the script and editing the movie could have doned it some good. \n\nGiving so much screen time for the director of the movie is always like a two way street, with Sling Blade B.Thornton does not have what it takes and sadly so.",

            "content": "Sling Blade marked the directorial debut of country singer turned actor Billy Bob Thornton, who also authored the script (expanding George Hickenlooper's acclaimed short Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade) and stars in the picture. Thornton plays Karl Childers, a mildly retarded man who spent most of his life in a mental institution. When Karl was a boy, he was severely mistreated by his abusive father (Robert Duvall). At age 12, Karl found his mother having intercourse with a man who tormented him endlessly; he snapped, flew into a homicidal rage, and killed both individuals by decapitating them. Years later, as a middle-aged man, Karl is deemed harmless to society and released from the mental institution where he resides. Karl says he has learned his lesson and adds, \"I reckon I got no reason to kill no one.\" He returns to the town of his boyhood, where he's befriended by Frank (Lucas Black), the son of a widowed mother who sees the eccentric but open-hearted Karl as a kindred spirit. Karl also gets a job at a fix-it shop and resides in the backroom, until Frank's mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), takes a liking to Karl and lets him stay with them. However, Karl also meets Doyle (Dwight Yoakam), Linda's boyfriend, a sadistically cruel, narrow-minded drunk who tosses casual abuse at Frank, treats Linda like dirt, and mocks Karl endlessly.\n\nStarring, Billy Bob Thornton, Dwight Yoakam, J.T.

            "content": "Small, independently produced cinematic gems such as Billy Bob Thornton's \"Sling Blade\" rarely have a chance to shine when competing for big-screen space in the multiplexes against those luminous, mega-budgeted, celebrity studded Hollywood features. In the same category, equally brilliant but dark-minded thrillers such as \"Fargo\" and \"Lone Star\" seldom find their audiences until they take up shelf space at your local video rental store. Most moviegoers simply don't know what they've missed because these movies don't have the giant advertising budgets of \"Star Wars\" or \"Jerry Maguire.\" Sadly, like \"Fargo\" and \"Lone Star,\" \"Sling Blade\" may suffer a similar demise. This is a real shame because these little movies deserve a better fate.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you never watched another movie in a theatre, you should see \"Sling Blade.\" This movie is that good! Comparatively, in Hollywood terms, \"Sling Blade\" crosses the goofy Tom Hanks' comedy \"Forrest Gump\" with the classic 1976 Robert De Niro psycho-chiller \"Taxi Driver.\" If your tastes run to literature, the \"Sling Blade\" plot resembles something that Southern Gothic writers such as William Faulkner and Flannery O'Conner might have cooked up.\r\n\r\nWhen we meet Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton of \"On Deadly Ground\"), he is about to be released from the state mental hospital. A retarded adult, Karl was committed when he was a child for hacking up his mother and her illicit lover with a sling blade. Our cretinous hero thought that his mama was being raped by a neighbor, when she was actually cheating on her husband. Karl has been behind bars for 25 years, so life in the free world holds little prospect for him. Although he wants to remain in the state hospital, the warden refuses to let him.\r\n\r\nKarl looks harmless enough. He wears his britches too high and his socks too low. He's a gravel-voiced, mild-mannered brute that learned to read the Bible and has a flair for fixing small motors. The warden of the state hospital, Jerry Woolridge (James Hampton of \"The Longest Yard\") finds him work at a repair shop in a rural town that could double for Andy Griffith's Mayberry. Karl befriends a fatherless youngster, Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and the boy's homely mother Linda Wheatley (Natalie Canerday of \"Biloxi Blues\"). She dates a drunken boyfriend, Dole Hargraves (Dwight Yoakum) who not only cheats on her but enjoys abusing her. At her son's request, Linda lets Karl bunk in their garage because Frank likes the way Karl talks. \"His voice,\" Linda observes, \"sounds like a race track.\" Karl and Linda's boyfriend Doyle don't see eye to eye. Eventually, the mean-spirited beau evicts Karl, but like Tom Hanks' retarded by savvy Forrest Gump character, Billy Bob Thornton's Karl conceals more common sense than most folks can imagine. Karl knows the vile Doyle is a snake, and Karl vows to protect young Frank and Frank's innocent mother from him.\r\n\r\nThe eccentric \"Sling Blade\" cast could be refugees from TV's \"Hee Haw.\" Incredibly enough, their Southern accents sound as genuine as their performances are sincere. Karl dates a monstrous cow of a woman who constantly complains about her feet. In a role reversal, she brings Karl the bouquet of flowers. Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall of \"The Godfather\" has a cameo has Karl's chair-ridden, good-for-nothing father who made him bury his prematurely born younger brother in a shoe box out in the backyard. Comedian John Ritter of the vintage ABC-TV sitcom \"Three's Company\" really stretches himself with an absolutely brilliant but low-key performance as Vaughan Cunningham, a bespectacled, pot-bellied homosexual. Ritter plays this difficult but outrageous role totally straight (pardon the pun), sparkling in a role that you'd never think he'd have the guts to accept. Although the other movie characters ridicule Ritter and his affair with the town mortician, the Billy Bob Thornton screenplay sympathizes with his character and shows him in a favorable light. County singer Dwight Yoakum drips pure evil as Linda's scummy boyfriend who carps on everybody for being less perfect that he is.\r\n\r\nThornton, a gifted character actor who has appeared in minor film parts, delivers a finely tuned performance that has justifiably earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Previously, Thornton played the nasty gambler in \"Tombstone\" and one of the short-lived, oil-rig villains in the Steven Seagal thriller \"On Deadly Ground.\" Not only does Thornton excel as Karl, but he also penned the script (for which he has also received an Oscar nomination) and directed this wonderfully poignant story, too. \"Sling Blade\" is a rare visual treat with several nice touches cleverly woven into the either background or the foreground and Thornton lets his cast dominate the action. The scene where the teenage drives the drunken boyfriend out of the house is so convincingly depicted that you feel like an intruder eavesdropping on the real thing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what makes \"Sling Blade\" seem so authentic is that everything here could really happen. No special effects, no auto chases, or big action scenes clutter up this simply spun, but devastating evocative saga.",

Thornton gives a tour de force performance, especially considering he also wrote and directed the picture.  It's a one-two-three combo that few others have pulled off so effectively.  The film feels nothing if not authentic.  Part of its effectiveness lies in the fact that it doesn't have grand ambitions.  It is content to be a simple story about a simple place.

            "content": "Sling Blade has become something of a cinematic enigma. The film is clearly best known for Karl Childers the bumbling, unintentional humorist rather than Karl Childers the gentle hearted and understanding soul, the film unfortunately remembered for one liners rather than its simplistically linear yet deeply-rooted and incredibly complex outlook on life and the human spirit. The film isn't about \"french fried potaters\" or whether or not the tool is known as a \"sling blade\" or a \"kaiser blade.\" Such quips -- and their admittedly outstanding and wholly convincing delivery -- are but a drop in the ocean of the film's true meaning and purpose. Not a film meant to entertain but rather to enlighten viewers on the true meaning of love and sacrifice, the very essence of Sling Blade may be encompassed in four words: \"you will be happy.\" Karl Childers, though externally nothing but a \"humped-over retard\" in the words of antagonist Doyle Hargraves, is instead not only a gentle soul with a peculiarly simple and absolute outlook on life, but also something of a Christ-like figure, a theme that remains with the film -- but subtly changes in meaning -- from beginning to end. Though his view of the world is far more narrow than that of Christ's and God's -- and certainly not as far-reaching vis-a-vis the salvation of one versus the salvation of all -- Karl has nevertheless come to understand the world at its most fundamental level. Though no man -- and certainly himself included -- is externally perfect, he recognizes the absolute good and absolute evil that exists within every soul he encounters. He sees the torment through which evil attempts to supersede good in a world that often seems blinded by wealth, stature, and smooth-talking and far too often openly accepts evil for the fear of earnestly combating it. Karl does not fall prey to the serpent's wiles, seeing past the faÃ§ade and sacrificing his place in the world -- a world he comes to describe as \"too big\" -- for the good of another.\r\n\r\nThey turned me loose from the nervous hospital, said I was well. \r\n\r\nThe mild-mannered Karl Childers (Billy Bob Thornton, The Informers) is set to be released from the state psychiatric hospital where he's lived since he killed his mother and her underage boyfriend while still an adolescent. Before his release, Karl recounts his tale to a journalism student, speaking of the murders and his life inside a small shed where a dug-out hole and a few quilts kept him comfortable enough in between his Bible lessons and biscuits-and-mustard meals. Once on the outside, Karl returns to his hometown, a world that's changed drastically since he last encountered it. Karl soon meets a young boy named Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift) outside a laundromat. He offers to help the young boy tote home his heavy bags of washing, the two striking an instant friendship. Despite the glimmer of hope in Karl's world, he seeks solace at the hospital, where its friendly and understanding director Jerry Woolridge (James Hampton) agrees to take Karl in for the night at his own home and promises him an interview for employment at a small repair shop in town. The shop's affable owner, Bill Cox (Rick Dial), opens his store and his heart to Karl, providing him the opportunity for an honest day's work, a steady wage, and even the shop's back room where Karl is allowed to sleep on an old army cot. Karl continues his relationship with Frank; he meets his mother Linda (Natalie Canerday) and her boss Vaughn (John Ritter, Bad Santa) but also comes to know Linda's abusive, arrogant, and hateful boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Country music star Dwight Yoakam, Crank 2: High Voltage). As Doyle's obscene and hurtful behavior increases alongside his disdain for Vaughn, Karl, and Frank, Karl must choose his destiny in an effort to make his new friend's life full, happy, and free of unwarranted abuse. \r\n\r\nI don't reckon I got no reason to kill nobody. \r\n\r\nAs alluded to earlier, Sling Blade seems a film that's perhaps not overlooked, but perhaps somewhat misunderstood. There's absolutely no denying the film's stellar performances (more on those later), but what it offers behind the performances -- an amazing spiritual journey into the heart of a man that knows only absolute right and absolute wrong -- makes for one of cinema's most compelling thematic offerings of all time. Sling Blade is a film about self-worth in both the context of how one presents themselves to the world and how a world reacts to that presentation. Despite Karl's dark history, funny way of speech, and odd physical mannerisms, he's as pure as newly-fallen snow on the inside, his morality straight as an arrow even if his limited mental acumen doesn't always allow for him to either fully comprehend the meaning or completely grasp the consequences of his actions, particularly those that marked his youth. Karl's life is defined by three distinct stages. As a boy, he was severely mistreated because of his mental and physical deficiencies. He was the object of ridicule by his peers and scorned by a family that forced him to live in a shed without much in the way of comfort or nutrition, coming as close to discarded as a human may be. After the murders, Karl entered into a stage of discovery while in the hospital where he kept and read several books, among them a trio that spells out the film's religious overtones: a book on Christmas, a book on carpentry, and the Bible. Though he admits to not fully understanding the Bible and recalls his surprise at several of its unidentified passages, it shapes his understanding of what is right and what is wrong, setting in place the film's moral quandary for his third stage, the summation and implementation of his life's lessons. Karl analyzes the world around him in a way only a man not completely corrupted by it could. He uses the tools in his arsenal -- Scripture and his own moral compass that's shaped by the wrongs done him, the wrongs he's done to others, and the love shown to him by those he meets upon his release from prison -- to formulate a course of action that will allow him to return the love shown him and follow in the example as set forth in his Bible as best he can. \r\n\r\nI love you, boy. \r\n\r\nIndeed, Sling Blade is a film about love. The bond Karl develops with Frank is one that absolutely defines love; it is played out through the course of the film with a pure and genuine countenance through both the scripted dialogue and the performances of the actors that makes it perhaps the most heartwarming and sincere relationship ever to grace the screen. It defines love in a way that film, and in many ways the world that exists outside of it, seems to have forgotten. The film's take on love, much like its take on sacrifice (the two seemingly interchangeable in definition), seems straight out of Scripture, the famed 1 Corinthians 13 passage to be exact. Karl's love for Frank, and Frank's love for Karl, captures the very essence of the description afforded to the word in the Bible where it is said to be patient and kind. It is said not to be envious, boastful, or proud. Love is not rude, self-seeking, or easily angered, the Bible says. It keeps no records of wrongs and does not delight in evil but instead rejoices in truth. It protects, trusts, hopes, preserves and, most importantly, it never fails. The dichotomy between Karl's love and Doyle's love for the Wheatley's couldn't be more disparate insofar as how they stem from Scripture's take on love. Karl's love is defined by the Scriptural take on the word, while Doyle's never once may be equated with anything but the antonyms of each definition as laid forth in the Bible. Whether or not Karl's solution to the dilemma at the end of the film is right or wrong to the world, Karl believes it to be correct based on the sum of his experiences that have come to be defined by two disparate periods in his life where he's experienced both the agony of absolute hate and the joys of pure love. \r\n\r\nWhat if he does it again? \r\n\r\nFinally, Sling Blade is a technical achievement the likes of which cinema rarely sees. As its writer, director, and star, Billy Bob Thornton's influence may be seen in every single second of the film. Sling Blade not only tells a wonderfully deep and meaningful story but also frames it in a lens that smartly allows the script and the actor's performances to sell the story. Few films offer such unobtrusive direction as Sling Blade; the minimalist approach greatly benefits the feel of the film. Often the camera simply lingers, allowing the action to play out almost as if on stage. Its movements are subtle and its cuts few and not at all intrusive. The writing befits the tone of the film, its relaxed Southern setting, and its slightly eccentric but generally down-to-earth and genuine characters, each memorable for their own reasons, particularly thanks to the honest and perfect performances from the actors. Of course, Billy Bob Thornton positively mesmerizes as Karl Childers. Immersing himself in the part so thoroughly and convincingly so as to completely metamorphose himself into an altogether separate being in every facet of existence, the performance demonstrates a level of excellence, commitment, and skill that's virtually impossible to outdo. The other performances seem to thrive off of Thornton's and are all excellent in their own right, even when Thornton's fellow actors, while in-character, seem positively in awe of the actor's ability. Dwight Yoakam excels as Doyle Hargraves, the performance almost matching Thronton's as its tonal antithesis. The foul-mouthed, honest to a nasty fault son-of-a-gun Hargraves is devilishly yet deliciously portrayed, the string of hate never once hidden from view even in his attempts to be more forthright and friendly towards the other characters. Lucas Black, Natalie Canerday, and John Ritter (see his performance near the end of the film for perhaps the finest choking-back-tears and astounded reaction shot ever captured on film) deliver wonderfully complex and nuanced efforts, and the film also enjoys stellar outings from its secondary actors: Bill Dial, J.T. Walsh as Karl's disturbed hospital mate, Robert Duvall as Karl's estranged father, James Hampton, and Brent Briscoe as Karl's co-worker Scooter.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Karl Childers comes to see the world as \"too big\" -- or in other words to see himself as \"too small\" -- to efficiently cope with it, despite his ability to understand it in absolutes and fully comprehend the clearly-delineated line between good and evil. With those two words, Karl nullifies not his Christ-like action of self-sacrifice for the salvation of another but does acknowledge that only Christ Himself is of the appropriate stature to take on the burdens of the world, not for the sake of one but for the sake of all. Sling Blade is a picture that allows viewers to perhaps leave the experience with a newfound appreciation for the many blessings that exist in the world and see the good that is to be found in it behind the shroud of darkness that seeks to obscure it. For the Wheatley's, that shroud was Doyle, and that blessing was Karl, a man of humble and externally confused means that, behind the veil of a man painted as a danger to others and a burden to society, offered an unmatched gentleness, a pure spirit, and a willingness to sacrifice for the good of another, to ease a burden, and deliver true happiness. A marvelous motion picture on every level and one of the most meaningful and complete to ever exist, Sling Blade is an all-time masterpiece that defines cinema at its absolute best.",

That is to say, it feels rather like one of those depressing little articles from the local section of your paper; perhaps 1 paragraph about a man with a mental disability, living with a poor family out in a the middle of nowhere, performs a seemingly senseless act of violence. It's something that you sadly shake your head at, but you never see much more of the event because such things happen to poor people who live out in the middle of nowhere, who are related to somebody who never got the support they needed. But this film is a sort of intricate glimpse into the lives of that local digest tragedy.\r\n\r\nThorton plays a decidedly accurate portrayal of a man with a mental disability (heck, I feel like I've met him before). The young Lucas Black was also a remarkably natural actor here- as was his mother, and as was, of course, the late great John Ritter. Sensitive and sad, it's a well-written, tense film not to be missed.",

He was in the institution because he murder his mom and her lover with a kaiser blade, \"Some folks call it a sling blade\". You'll probable thinking this movie is a mix between Forrest Gump and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but it isn't. And if you did thought that, then you are stupid.\r\n\r\nThis movie is just pure nice, it has great performances and directing, good character development, a good story, and nice music. Unfortunately this movie is just mostly talking. There are no dinosaurs, or tall ugly blue smurfs, no running across the country, no big oil spill, no country for old men, its just talking. Some stuff does happen here and there, but mostly it was just talking, and I loved every minute of it. Seriously you'll never thought talking would been so God darn interesting, I was really curious what was happening. Unlike most of the movies I was watching at that time, like The Color Purple and Patton, I actually CARED what they were talking about, weird I don't know how the movie was able to do that, but it did.\r\n\r\nWhile I loved ALL the performances in this movie, I'll give my hats off to Billy Bob Thornton's performance as the main guy. I found it hard not to smile while seeing him in this movie, because I'm used to him in Bad News Bears and those other stupid comedies he does, just like Charlie Sheen in Platoon and Whoopi Goldberg in The Color Purple. But unlike the latter, I found him perfect in this role, he did such a good job, a well deserved Oscar nomination.\r\n\r\nNow the movie has very interesting morals, like what does it mean to be a good person, and the rights to kill someone. Throughout the movie, the main Protagonist is always aware of his killings, but he is probable the nicest person ever. An other character is a homosexual, and is often faced with prejudgment, but is an over all nice fella. It shows that, despite what one person may have done or is, that doesn't mean there not a nice person. Also throughout the film, many of the characters have openly admitted of wanting to kill someone who is very evil and mean. As the audience gets to know the main Antagonist, the more the audience knows how evil he is and how he truly deserves to die. This shows how killing someone may not actually be such an insane as some may think. The Protagonist is divided on that choice, to kill or not to kill, even though he claims he has no reason to kill anyone else. \r\n\r\nI won't say no more except that this movie is really good, and I really liked it. 5/5",

However, this is all based upon Hollywood perspective, as I am yet to see even a single film where anyone acts like a real person to even a mild degree. For these standards, the film's performances are exceptional.\r\n\r\nYou really buy into it being a small southern town, as well as the leading character Karl having a long ago history there. Many characters know of him or at least his actions that got him placed into the institution all those years ago, but none of them truly know him as he was very young and few of them know it was he personally who committed such acts. The leading character, while being mentally challenged and a bit difficult to understand at times, is quite likable in spite of his past and you really learn to care for him, knowing that not a single action of his life had true malice behind it as much as simple ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe storyline is interesting, be it a tad unoriginal and simplistic, but perhaps this is not a bad thing at all. The flow is quite smooth, if a little slow at times. The pace is fairly enjoyable, though, constructed and progressed well. It is a fine example of character study, however the supporting characters are a bit shallow and forgotten under the heavy focus of Karl himself.\r\n\r\nThe antagonist is quite convincing and well acted, but the problem there is the lack of a true depth to him. You see several negative acts committed by him, but none that truly warrant him as a bad person but much closer to simply an every day aggressive drunk. He is nothing special or interesting, and while this is the point to his character the movie does not tell you enough about him on an emotional and mental level to really learn to dislike him fairly, it nearly feels forced.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film is quite good and definitely worth the time you will spend on it. It is a little flat and slow at times, as well as quite predictable, but it has heart and talent behind it. Billy Bob is at his best, and if you are a fan of his you should not miss this film. However, sadly that seems to be the strongest audience that will positively receive it. While the average movie-goer is certain to approve, I somewhat doubt that anyone who dislikes Billy Bob specifically will find anything redeeming enough to make the film stand out.\r\n\r\nThree stars with a minus, out of four.",

            "content": "Early in 1990, when Billy Bob Thornton was contemplating writing a screenplay, Hollywood legend Billy Wilder advised him to write something that would allow Thornton to take advantage of his \"less than perfect features.\"  Or so the story goes.  With that little piece of wisdom, Thornton proceeded to write, direct, and star in one the most bizarre, fascinating, and gripping films of that decade.\r\n\r\nLooking for the most worrisome characters in the history of filmdom?  We give you Thornton's Karl Childers.  Now a middle aged man with a peculiar walk and speech pattern, he has just been released from an asylum where he had been committed since childhood for killing his mother and her lover with a sling blade. But Thornton and Childers have some surprises in store for us, and a few lessons they want to teach us along the way.\r\n\r\nVirtually every member of this cast delivers in a big way.  Thornton's performance is one of the best ever.  No hyperbole here.  He is simply flawless as he creates a character that you will remember for the rest of your life.  John Ritter is also terrific, and Dwight Yoakam is fantastic as the heel.  Lucas Black and Natalie Canerday sell their characters -- important contributions, since the plot would falter without their credible performances as the mom and son who unconditionally accept odd Karl into their lives.\r\n\r\nHaving seen Sling Blade several times, my only criticism is the protracted scene where Karl and Frank have a long talk at the lake.  It doesn't seem to add much to our understanding of these two key characters, and needlessly alters the pace of the film.\r\n\r\nBut highlighting this singular flaw is nit-picking.  Sling Blade is a rare breed -- a fantastic film that is simultaneously grueling, tense, and uplifting.  It is also a film that will hopefully give you pause when you pass judgment on those that you might otherwise be eager to condemn.",

The rest of the cast is great also though.\r\n\r\nI think the main thing is that this isn't just a drama about a mentally changed man that pulls at your heartstrings. It's a drama that brings lots of emotions out of you at different points. One time you're enjoying the good nature of the scenes with Karl and Frank. The next minute your exposed to the entertaining, but also sad character of Doyle Hardgraves\r\nwho comes off as a typical trailer park trash character, but it's played so convincingly that you really don't care that it's a stereotypical character.\r\n\r\nDoyle is an evil man that put down those around him in entertaining but also sickening fashion.

I had heard many positive things about 'Sling Blade' before I finally saw it, but nothing could prepare me for the poignant and strong affect the movie was to have on me. From Billy's performance of a mentally retarded man who has recently been released from prison after the murder of his mother and her lover, to the performances within the notably strong cast from the likes of the abusive Dwight Yoakam and timid John Ritter. This excellent film moves slowly through the realms of character development, but it's climatic end is well worth the wait. Mixing elements of films like Forrest Gump, 'Sling Blade' is a modern classic.",

Billy Bob Thornton's incredibly restrained performance is what keeps this movie interesting, he creates a character so broken from his former life, and now his new one, that the only thing that matters in his life (that being Lucas Black's character) is worth fighting for. You'll probably see the ending coming from a mile away, but it is definitely a fitting one. Great acting all-around, from Thornton, Dwight Yoakam, John Ritter, and Lucas Black as the boy who befriends Thornton, this is an impressive movie. Don't watch it if you don't like sad stories, this is definitely a somber tale of a man who doesn't know where he fits in a world that is \"to big\" for him, as he says himself.",

Ritter gets the best material, and shows himself to be the legendary talent that he was. He plays gay without being ridiculous.

The story deals with a murderer released back into society only to kill again only for all the right reasons.  Friendship and forgiveness.  It's a tale of how victims fall into their role of tragedy and how some people stand up.  John Ritter excelled and the little boy (whoever that was) delivered a great performance.  In the end, it was long and i was expecting more.  The movie was simple like it's main character and most things were on the surface easy to see.  What a debut from Billy bob.

This classic, that's what. I've long enjoyed this film from the late 90s, written and directed by the Bad Santa himself. It's a fine outing of randomness and dark comedy. Do yourself a favor and watch the director's cut which contains nearly 15 minutes of additional scenes added into the movie. \n\nKarl Childersl (Thornton) befriends Frank, a kind, well behaved young man who lives in the old town Karl's from but hasn't walked in since getting locked up in the mental hospital for killing his mother and a neighborhood troublemaker. Frank's got problems, as his mother's boyfriend Doyle is a drunken asshat who mentally abuses both of them and threatens to get physical should Frank's mom ever leave him. Karl and Doyle are put on a path that will lead to the two of them clashing inevitably, while Karl tries to protect Frank, his mother, and their friend who manages the store she works at (played by the late John Ritter). In-between the serious nature and the looming threat of Doyle, Karl and Frank become best of friends, share laughs and have some serious talks. Then there's the laugh out loud moments, such as when Karl is introduced to a woman who suffers from the same problem he does (minus the homicidal past), and she tells him about how she doesn't like to help customers at the store. When her feet hurt. There's a disturbing yet delightful cameo from J.T. Walsh as well. \n\nThis came out in 1996 and its staying power is nothing short of fantastic. All these years later, and I still laugh when Thornton is asked to take a look at a lawnmower that isn't working right. He says, \"It ain't got no gas in it!\" in that funny voice he uses for Karl throughout the film. Love it.",

Completely opposite here as Billy Bob completely immerses himself in the role of Karl Childers. Childers is a mentally retarded, ex-killer, who has a sweet and very loving side. The voice that Thornton uses cracks me up and I wonder how difficult it was to do. Not to mention the facial expression he wears throughout the film's entirety. Props Billy Bob; major props. Not a bad performance in here with a pleasantly surprising strong supporting character in John Ritter. Ritter plays the gay friend who only wants happiness and safety for his loved ones (best friend, her son, his lover) and himself in the small hick town. The most surprising role goes to Dwight Yoakum; wow. This shows that he's not just a guy who plays bit supporting roles, he can easily hold his own as a leading character in the right movie. Really just a great story all the way around of acceptance and sacrifice. It's way better than what Clint Eastwood attempted to do with \"Gran Torino\". \"Sling Blade\" is sad, amusing, and touching and makes you care about its main characters. Very good stuff.",

His portrayal of Karl, a man of limited intellectual sophistication, has an intense physical quality - slow moving, slow thinking, his drawl as slow as molasses in January.\n\nWe follow Karl on his release from incarceration in a mental hospital; he's served 25 years, his entire adult life, undergoing custodial treatment for some heinous slaying with a switchblade. He's clearly not seen as a danger by the staff of the institution: he seems a man more offended against than offending. He has no home, no family, no friends - his life revolves around the institution, and it is throwing him out.\n\nHe returns to his home town clutching a parcel of books, there to befriend a young boy and his mother. He proves adept at repairing engines and begins to impress the locals as a man with a gentle heart and well-reasoned moral sensibilities. And then the mother's abusive boyfriend arrives on the scene.\n\nIt's a very sympathetic portrayal by Thornton, at once convincing and engaging without straying into the realm of the sentimental. The film moves at easy pace with a gentle undercurrent of humour as it makes ironic statements about images of masculinity and the small town's assumption that because Karl takes so long to think about even simple things, he must be a particularly deep thinker.\n\nThe humour, however, has a dark quality to it - there's none of the sentimentality and bathos of \"Forrest Gump\". Karl, as he explains, dryly, matter-of-fact how he was incarcerated for a double killing. It transforms the sympathetic, simple, gentle man into a character straight out of \"Halloween\".\n\nThornton plays with the audience, frequently creating scenes which seem to have a predictable, clichéd quality, but which take a gentle spin. The conclusion, however, might be seen as inevitable, but there is a degree of moral ambiguity. How do you allocate or anticipate responsibility for an action?\n\nA superb performance by Thornton, Dwight Yoacham gives an equally convincing performance as the abusive boyfriend, and Robert Duval appearrs to deliver a cameo performance (setting echoes for Karl of the Boo Radley character Duval played in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\").\n\nThere is a superb assembly of extras here - interviews with Thornton, an exploration of his life and work, a commentary, an extra 20-odd minutes of film, and contributions by other members of the cast. A excellent anamorphic, widescreen transfer, with good sound and lighting and picture quality which belie its relatively low-budget genesis. A stunningly good movie - moving, engaging, enraging, enthralling.",

It's about this \"slow\" guy (although you never \"KNOW\" he's mentally handicapped) and his release from a mental hospital, where has was for killing his mom and another guy. It's about this character integrating into a community and making friends (and working...and eating french fries). Hearing him speak made me realize where about a dozen other movie references came from. Highly recommend (there was a comment about it being like To Kill A Mockingbird...I can see that). Watch it if you haven't yet!",
