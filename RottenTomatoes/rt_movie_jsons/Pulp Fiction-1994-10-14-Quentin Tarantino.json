    "summary": "Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hitmen with a penchant for philosophical discussions. In this ultra-hip, multi-strand crime movie, their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) ; his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman) ; struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) ; master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, \"Pumpkin\" (Tim Roth) and \"Honey Bunny\" (Amanda Plummer).",

It's a slow burner for the first hour as it introduces it's characters and starts setting up plot points that will ultimately pay off in the second half. That's when most of the films action and memorable moments takes place. The cast is great with strong performances from Jackson, Travolta and Willis. This is where Tarantino's signature style really kicks off, I can see why this film has become a classic. If you enjoy Tarantino's films then you'll like this one, it's funny, violent and has great dialogue.",

            "content": "Superb acting by Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, two hit men who maybe are in fact as dumb as they look, in what's really a long, lurid wallow in bloody violence in Quentin Tarantino's overpraised second movie in 1994. The allegedly great intertwining of three plot strands is kind of pointless, as is the role of Uma Thurmond, saddled with a strange black wig, as a dangerous gangster's girlfriend Mia who goes out on a date with Travolta's Vincent in his best behavior, kept narrowly chaste by Mia's having a heroin overdose. There are some wonderful set-pieces, including a scene in a theme restaurant where the wait staff are impersonators of classic Hollywood icons, the tables are set in models of classic cars, and a faux Ed Sullivan MCs a twist contest in which the legendarily great dancer Travolta as Vincent goes through the motions, evidently generously ceding the floor to Thurmond's cocaine-addled Mia, who appears to be having a seizure to Church Berry's \"You Never Can Tell.\" They do win the trophy, however. Director Quentin Tarantino's giving himself a small part in his movie shows what great acting looks like compared to an amateur. Tarantino wrote some hilarious dialogue between Jackson and Travolta, and a subtly satirical and provocatively silly scene in which Christopher Walken is a POW Vietnam veteran solemnly delivering an heirloom watch  to a somewhat confused boy. whose deceased father concealed it up his butt from his captors. In all, the movie is a five-dollar milkshake from the (fictitious) Jack Rabbit Slim's Hollywood-themed restaurant, and as Travolta's Vincent concedes to his date Thurmond's Mia, that's a pretty good milkshake, all things considered. Luckily, Tarantino kept on making movies.",

            "content": "As the title suggests, this is not really a coherent story, but rather an anthology of related noir stories.  It is highly stylized, emphasizing coolness over substance or story.  Characters are exaggerated cartoons of themselves.  Scenes (like driving) are deliberately shot in noir 50s-60s style. Dialogue is heavily emphasized, often with conversations being irrelevant to the actions at hand (eg: talking about fast food while shaking down and shooting people).  Again, I think this is to make the characters appear 'cool' and to provide the audience a jolting disconnect from reality.\nI recall this having a much bigger impact on me in the 90s.  Now, a lot of the film appears dated and passe, although this is not really fair to it as it is in many ways the grand daddy of excessive pointless violence.  Some of the film cuts, fades, and even the film quality itself seem faded.  Sadly, one of the few parts of this film to probably retain any shock value into the 2020s is the racial aspect (eg: \"dead n*** storage\").  The film seems to have gotten quite a bit of blowback retroactively, which is hilarious.  On the list of awful things Tarentino did to American culture, damaging race relations probably doesn't even hit the top 50.  Quite the contrary, this film shows black and white characters married, working and killing together, which I think was maybe not cutting edge in the 90s, but progressive for a popular movie.  You could have swapped the race of any character, and it would have had zero impact on the film.\nIs it a good film?  I think it achieves its goals... the shock, the style, the cool.  I didn't particularly care for any of the characters or the stories, but it was a bit like not being able to look away from a car wreck.  My son, who was born 10 years after the film was released, totally didn't get it, and I had to keep explaining what the director was trying to do, so hard to say how this will age.",

            "content": "Pulp Fiction is a 1994 crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film is known for its nonlinear storyline, eclectic soundtrack, and memorable dialogue. It features an ensemble cast including John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, and Bruce Willis, among others.\n\nThere are several reasons why Pulp Fiction is considered a great film. First and foremost, the film's screenplay is a masterclass in storytelling. Tarantino's use of nonlinear narrative creates a sense of mystery and intrigue that keeps the audience engaged and on their toes. The dialogue is witty, sharp, and memorable, with iconic lines such as \"I'm gonna get medieval on your ass\" and \"Royale with cheese\" becoming cultural touchstones.\n\nThe film's ensemble cast is also outstanding, with each actor delivering a memorable performance. John Travolta's portrayal of hitman Vincent Vega is a standout, as is Samuel L. Jackson's iconic turn as his partner Jules Winnfield. Uma Thurman's portrayal of Mia Wallace, the wife of a crime boss, is both glamorous and dangerous, while Bruce Willis brings a sense of pathos to his role as a boxer on the run.\n\nThe film's stylish visuals, eclectic soundtrack, and pop culture references also add to its greatness. The use of music, ranging from surf rock to soul to disco, creates a unique and memorable atmosphere, while the film's nods to classic pulp fiction and film noir add to its cool and stylish vibe.\n\nOverall, Pulp Fiction is a great film that has become a classic of the crime genre. Its expertly crafted screenplay, outstanding ensemble cast, stylish visuals, and memorable soundtrack make it a must-watch for anyone interested in cinema. The film's impact on popular culture cannot be overstated, and its enduring legacy continues to influence filmmakers and audiences alike.",

The way Tarantino weaves multiple storylines together is a testament to his storytelling abilities. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and often hilarious, providing a stark contrast to the dark and violent themes of the movie.\n     The soundtrack is another highlight of the film, featuring classic songs from the 60s and 70s that complement the vintage themes of the movie perfectly. The look and feel of the movie are also impressive, with every scene and shot meticulously crafted to create a unique visual experience.\n     In conclusion, The film's themes of violence and redemption, random sh*t, coupled with its sharp dialogue and superb performances, make it an unforgettable experience. Whether you are a fan of mob movies or not, this film is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates great cinema.",

However Quentin's script and directing is top class and never lets up. Long takes such as the hallway scene where Vincent and Jules discuss Marcellus Wallace's antics show off the skill of this film and how the dialogue grips the audience in a scene most directors would skip through. However I do think the watch part of this film could've been cut and this films would reputation would only differ slightly ( As getting bum raped over a medieval torture device may steer grandma away from recommending it to the local book club ).I do think this film is brilliant but it does not feel as smooth as Tarintino's later work such as Django Unchained or Inglorious Basterds it is still his best work and is a must watch for film lovers.",

However, \"Pulp Fiction\" was a culmination of a lot of ideas about the ways that movie-writing works. Tarantino's previous credit included \"True Romance,\" only a few years previously. But the idea for \"Pulp Fiction\" has its roots in the traditions of Italian cinema and giallo, and American literature. Before the disappearance of the mysterious giallo books' circulation in the mid 20th century, pulp fiction had gained momentum in America in mimicry of the strange high-end thriller series. The idea of pulp fiction is to take a saturated plot, that is boiling over with details and nuance in thriller-suspense, and to condense it and make it entertaining and fast-paced, and easier to understand through its purposeful perspectives. The movie takes after this style strongly, and the result is a masterpiece.",

It's almost as if I'd built up a kind of resistance to the cult around Tarantino and the mystique around his undoubted gifts. But getting back to the film itself, it's true that it just about (but only just) justifies the baggy running time (unlike subsequent films); it's funnier than I remember, and I enjoyed it more than I'd convinced myself I would. It's impressive, and it may ultimately be somewhat empty ... but there's no doubting either its significance, that when it's good it really flies, and that Tarantino's trademark lack of wisdom and restraint is on show too.",

It's a film that's been talked about so much that I won't venture to go into detail, but I'm glad I got to see it before my Tarantino fever completely cooled off from the boredom of \"Reservoir Dogs\". As one of the most delightful masterpieces of cinema to have been produced around the world in the last quarter century, it is personally the most enjoyable and giddy film to have been released in 1994, and perhaps my favorite, entertaining romp of all time.",

The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

At first I wasn't sure I could see a lot of substance between the various sub plots but by the end, I admit it did come together reasonably well. The key moments, to me, were Uma Thurman dancing with Travolta in the diner/bar and Jules talking about his dislike for eating anything he regards as dirty (never mind the irony/hypocracy that he kills people for a living). There is some dark comedy, although it didn't entirely appeal to me but I can understand why other people really like it. It was interesting to see the director in such a long-ish scene towards the end - usually, from the films I've seen anyway, when the film director or writer (Stan Lee etc.) appears in their film, as a cameo of sorts, it tends to be a pretty brief and often dialogue free occurence but not this time, although I can't say I liked the strongly racist language used but generally this is a good film of its sort I suppose. I liked the scene with Tim Roth's character, Pumpkin, in his self inflicted scenario (which we see briefly at the start) being played out towards the end.\n\nI also remembered that there was a large movie poster of this film up in the classroom I used to study media studies in, in the late 90s, so that was a slight flashback. Pulp Fiction was on one wall and Assassins with Stallone and Banderas was on the other one I think - oh and 'Peter's Friends' on another wall I think but I haven't seen that film yet(!).\n\nIf it sounds of interest to you then yes, I'd recommend it, although if your either reasonably squeamish and/or don't like hard drug use or sexual violence hinted at (although not explicitly shown, or not in the film version I saw anyway), then this would be best avoided I suppose.",
