    "summary": "Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean without a ship or crew. His timing is inopportune, however, because later that evening the town is besieged by a pirate ship. The pirates kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who's in possession of a valuable coin that is linked to a curse that has transformed the pirates into the undead. A gallant blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) in love with Elizabeth allies with Sparrow in pursuit of the pirates.",

            "content": "An All Time Classic! The acting is phenomenal with loads of chemistry, charm, and energy with the standouts being Deep & Rush who are amazing with quirky performances. The villain is just as memorable as the hero. The supporting cast is all really good too. The cinematography is where this truly shines and envelops you in this world. the set design, lighting, costumes, props, and loads of special effect with a  limited amount of CGI all works to create a unique, fun and memorable experience. The fights are awesome with most being practical effects and the CGI is more fun than scary which works here well. The music is amazing as well and one of the best title tracks ever as well. The editing is very good although the first 30-40 minutes it jumps around a bit but you can overlook that because of how it envelops you in this world with the ascetics and quirky performances. The pacing is phenomenal as well.  the only minor complaints is there are a few farfetched moments like the end when Turner throws the sword under Deeps feet and when on the island the ship happens to be the one that is carrying the Commadore. But honestly it is so charming, fun and well done it's totally easy to overlook. Anyone should give this a watch, its a great fun time.",

They tried something new with this movie and I think it worked out great. Introducing supernatural elements to this pirate adventure makes this film a lot more interesting. It also opens the door for much greater stories to be told. The characters of this movie aren't what I expected. The characters are often humorous and silly which, I admit, adds a lot of charm. From swordfights to ship battles, the action in this movie is also very good, especially the final duel. In conclusion, this is a good movie that experimented with a unique concept and opened the doors to many greater adventures.",

The cinematography in this movie is great but it does have some grain but it actually adds so much atmosphere to the movie, I love the product set design, the fight scenes looks hard hitting even with the special effects of all the pirates looking like zombies. Some scenes look so cinematic and it's close ups is amazing, you can see the eye colours, pimples of people faces and even the dirt, that is why it would be a dream to watch these movies in 4k. The sound is obviously amazing, the pirate music hits hard, they didn't try to modernize the music by having modern music in it, they went full out pirate themed on the music and it actually works so well. They don't have music playing continuously, they out the music at the right time leaving us with sound effects making the scenes so much more immersive. The story is really good, though either the pace is rally slow or they have so much happening at once, you either trying to hear what they are talking about or you glued to the screen watching sword fights and gun battles. But overall it's all just amazing. You can never go wrong with Pirates of the Caribbean.",

Putting that aside, this is a truly wonderful film, that is definitely one of the highlights of 2003. The whole film is a wonder to look at, with splendid costumes and very realistic sets. The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like \"Stop blowing holes in my ship,\" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",

            "content": "Swash and buckle.  I somewhat doubt that you need me to tell you what this is about, but just in case you forgot: you've got a blacksmith's apprentice (Orlando Bloom), a governor's daughter (Keira Knightly), and a scoundrel pirate (Johnny Depp).  Their paths are on a collision course, and when you add undead pirates with hurt feelings to the equation, that will only complicate the situation.  I've been meaning to rewatch this one for a minute because it is so much fun.  You can say what you want about the sequels; I personally think they have their moments, especially Dead Man's Chest, but I understand why people view them as fodder for the Hollywood blockbuster machine.  With The Curse of the Black Pearl, I doubt you will find many out there who want to argue a case against it.  Now, as you may already be aware, this is a movie that is based on a Disney theme park ride.  Not many movies originate from park attractions, and even fewer are worth talking about, but the first Pirates is the exception to the rule.  Appropriately enough, the movie itself feels like an exciting ride, and there are very few lulls to be found from start to finish.  The pacing is dynamite, and even though the runtime is approaching two and a half hours, you don't feel it since there is perpetual forward movement.  Pirates made a huge imprint on pop culture, and for better or worse, it unlocked the quirky performance library of Johnny Depp.  It's arguably his most iconic role to date, and you can tell he had the best time making this movie.  Bloom and Knightley also bring a lot to the table, but I think it is Geoffrey Rush as the main antagonist Barbossa that doesn't get nearly enough credit for his performance.  He always feels like a threat, and whenever he pops up, you're just waiting to hear what he will say next.  When I think of movies that aim to entertain, this is one of the most successful movies out there.  It has so much natural charisma that it is just downright infectious to watch.  It's so much fun to watch allegiances shift on a dime, and it has the perfect energy that you want to see in a blockbuster.  I will say that the CGI hasn't aged the best, which is a little tough because it is so reliant on the special effects for these ghost pirates.  It can also be tough to get this to the television as often as I would like because of the longer runtime, even though I wouldn't cut anything out.  Still, those are minor quibbles for an otherwise massively pleasing megahit.",

            "content": "Wow, I was not expecting the movie to start out with such a bang. So much atmosphere and tension. I love it. This is of course back when Disney was on top of their game. Fantastic use of imagery, the cinematography is insanely good and well thought out. Beautiful use of lighting. I love how they cut to Elizabeth waking up right after she sees the ghostly pirate ship in her dreams. Pretty spooky. It keeps you anticipating and interested. The CGI is actually impressive, especially for its time. This movie has a very cheeky and silly sense of humor. What an iconic character, I honestly can't see anyone else playing Jack Sparrow other than Johnny Depp. He is Jack Sparrow. He really does have a knack for clever and witty humor. It's impressive how well they nail the whole look, style and aesthetic of the 1700's. It almost feels like I'm watching a movie that takes place in the world of Assassin's Creed Black Flag. Plenty of exciting moments keep it from becoming boring or bland. The sword duels and ship fights being one of them. The whole movie has a great comedic flair to it. The set pieces and designs are wonderfully crafted. \n\nUnfortunately, this is one of those movies where if you've seen it once, you've seen it a hundred times. The story isn't really anything special that leaves you thinking after the credits roll, it's more of a ride that you enjoy taking part in. It felt like the movie could've benefitted if it had cut a couple of scenes short or had not shown them at all. It felt like the pacing was excellent at the beginning but then towards the middle, it lagged a bit, showing scenes that we didn't necessarily need. If they would've shortened the movie to about 1 hour 50 something or close to the 2 hour mark, I think it would've been better. \n\nOverall, it's a fun adventure pirate movie with exciting sequences, funny moments, tight camera work and one of the most iconic characters, and that's really it. The story didn't really wow me, it felt kind of vapid, and some of the characters felt bland since there wasn't any interesting character development going on. But more than anything, it was too long. I would recommend it, but I think everyone and their grandma has seen it already.",

The script is just a gem, with classic and original lines like \"Stop blowing holes in my ship,\" that sometimes have you in gales of laughter. I did find the pirates as skeletons quite frightening though. Films that have scared me are The Mummy and Pitch Black. The performances were first-rate, especially Johnny Depp in possibly his best performance. His character Jack Sparrow is a somewhat charming, likable rogue, and Depp pulled him off to perfection. As Barbossa, Geoffrey Rush positively sinks his teeth into his role, sometimes sinister and sometimes fun. Kiera Knightly proves once again that she looks lovely in period dramas, because it really does suit her. Orlando Bloom is dashing as Will Turner. Before I round off, I want to mention another aspect of the film, the music by Hans Zimmer(Lion King)... it was outstanding! Zimmer should be up there with the great film composers, like James Horner(American Tail, Titanic), John Williams(ET, Home Alone) and the late Jerry Goldsmith.(Legend, The Shadow) All in all, a highly entertaining film! 10/10 Bethany Cox.",

However, Gore Verbinski (The Cure For Wellness) directs with such energy and creativity that the story is exhilarating. It's a scary tale about ghost pirates, romance and rum, plenty of rum. The set pieces are well-conceived and feel alive with a palpable sense of history. Johnny Depp's (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas) iconic creation of Jack Sparrow carries the picture. The way he walks and the way he talks, he just inhibits the character perfectly. Opposite him is the incredible Geoffrey Rush (The King's Speech). Playing the perfect antagonist, the pair riff of each other brilliantly. The Curse Of The Black Pearl remains a rarity that not only met my expectations but exceeded them. I can clearly recall after leaving the cinema in the summer of 2003 eager to see it again.",

Low ceiling, but super low floor (Live action remakes, Artemis Fowl, John Carter ect.). In this metaphor the first three Pirates of The Caribbean movies get to join Mighty Ducks in the attic above the apartment because the franchise is actually pretty good. \n\nThe first movie is the weakest of the trilogy however, but still it stands on its own as a solid entertaining pirate adventure. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, the world's best pirate, so it may seem anyways. The movie centers around his former crew, trying to reverse an ancient curse by returning once stolen gold. May as well spoil my opinion right away but I believe this curse is the weakest part of the movie. The pirates are immortal as long as the curse is active so any sword fight with them can only end in a loss or a temporary victory. This made the climax of the film kinda boring, as it's just a waiting game to see when the pieces will be returned.\n\nThe cast of characters is the movie's strongest aspect and thankfully it takes full advantage of it. Jack Sparrow is goofy, but still incredibly savvy and competent. He never seems immortal or untouchable; he faces true peril and struggle. For such a recognizable figure he loses so much and that's fully for the best. He loses his ship, crew, friends, gets captured and then Jailed for his crimes! Fortunately for him meets the world's second biggest simp, behind Jack from Titanic, Will Barton. \n\nWill Barton is my second favourite character in this entire franchise, a man whose attraction to Elizabeth's see's him giving up his entire life, home, moral code and career just to deliver her to her fiance. True white night right there, pokimane tier 3 subs and got shit on my man Will. \n\nElizabeth Swan is a capable damsel in distress with an interest in pirate culture, for some reason. It's never really explained, but it's helpful regardless. She's fine, moving on. \n\nThe comedic relief shines in this movie. The two pirates are the stars of the franchise in my opinion, they're just fantastic. Pintel and Ragetti absolutely steal the show, delivering the most comedic lines and the most memorable scenes. \n\nIn conclusion, while the finale is lacking in steaks, the movie overall is great. Fun action scenes, great comedic relief and comedic tone. The pirates movie is a solid movie.",

Every action scene is filled with colourful visuals, both practical and CGI, and the ride this film takes the audience on is one to behold. Keira Knightley as the damsel in distress in the first half of the film is pretty lame, but she does grow and become likeable by the second half (aside from her bad action girl line about the corset), and I never had any issues with Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. The soundtrack is iconic, even if the plot is simplistic, but the clever writing makes up for it, and then some - the lines in this are cracker. Great fun for families, through there's some spooks to be had. | Grade: A-",

It has a great villain with Barbossa and perfectly balanced character developments along with entertaining parallels.

            "content": "A highly entertaining family adventure on the high seas!\n\nGore Verbinski's romantic fantasy swashbuckler Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) is a fast paced blast of constant laughter and exciting action. Gore Verbinski's direction incredibly balances slap stick and witty humor alongside daring adventure. His unique vision of funny comedy, tender romance, and scary horror elements work wonders for Pirates of the Caribbean as a quick corsair adventure that any family can watch. Gore Verbinski is an excellent director with a real style and atmosphere that contributes a genuine love of sailing, pirates, and swashbuckling to this film full of sword fights and cannonfire.\n\nJohnny Depp is phenomenal as the likable Captain Jack Sparrow, who outwits his enemies all over the high seas. He's funny and endearing, so much so that you always root for Jack to get out of all his precarious nautical situations. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as Captain Hector Barbossa with his cheery pirate laugh, gnarly speech, and intimidating presence. Orlando Bloom is cool as a blacksmith turned pirate for the sake of love named Will Turner. He's an endearing lead actor with a fun chemistry alongside Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.\n\nKeira Knightley is wicked as the fiery Miss Elizabeth Swann. Her sense of adventure and mischief are obvious thanks to Knightley's spirited performance as Pirates of the Caribbean's leading lady. Miss Swann is simply a wonderfully complex character.\n\nJack Davenport is aptly prudish and stuffy as the British Commodore James Norrington. Jonathan Pryce is funny as the traditional family values loving Governor Weatherby Swann. Kevin McNally is entertaining as the steadfast first mate to Captain Jack Sparrow called Joshamee Gibbs. He's a likable staple of the series alongside David Bailie's mute and parroted Cotton. Zoe Saldana is great as the feisty Anamaria. I wish they used her more throughout the Pirates franchise.\n\nI must mention how hilarious Lee Arenberg is as the stout and grumpy Pintel. He's quite imposing in this first one with perfect line delivery for \"hello poppet.\" I adore Mackenzie Crook's portrayal of the gaunt and gangly pirate Ragetti. Crook is hilarious with his endless literary references, false eye, and good nature. I should also shout out Giles New and Angus Barnett's as the two argumentative Navy guards Murtogg and Mullroy, respectively. They are such a funny comedy relief pairing akin to Arenberg and Crook's Pintel and Ragetti.\n\nDariusz Wolski's cinematography looks breathtaking for every wide shot of the ocean, a sunrise, or pirates advancing. His panning shots sweep around the swordplay to make every action scene riveting and enthralling to watch! Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is fantastic with clever jokes that make Captain Jack Sparrow a hilarious hero and a cunning foe for the Royal Navy to contend with constantly. Their story is phenomenal as they tell a compelling tale about greedy pirates cursed by Aztec gold on a quest for their salvation. That is just as engaging as a young blacksmith's journey into piracy alongside a vetern, disgraced pirate captain to save his bonnie lass.\n\nArthur Schmidt, Stephen E. Rivkin, and Craig Wood's editing makes Pirates of the Caribbean a brisk 143 minute epic adventure that never gets old. Klaus Badelt's score is unforgettable. Hans Zimmer always gets the credit for composing the Pirates of the Caribbean's music, but Klaus Badelt actually made the music for The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's exhilarating and inspiring with memorable melodies and pulsing rhythms. Penny Rose's pirate costumes look realistic and period correct with tons of added details that make each character look unique. Ve Neill's make-up is excellent and intriguing as he gives each pirate their own style in appearance.\n\nThe CGI was groundbreaking for the cursed skeleton pirates in the moonlight that still looks amazing. Brian Morris' production design is astounding in that they built real pirate ships and large galleons for the sets. All the practical stunts and minimal use of special effects makes Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl timeless. This is how adventure blockbusters should be crafted by a loving crew.\n\nI love this franchise and The Curse of the Black Pearl remains the greatest pirate adventure movie of the whole bunch.",

The story is well-written with interesting characters. Johnny Depp plays Captain JAck Sparrow and is a constant scene stealer. He is a well-rounded anti-hero and provides some comedic relief occasionally. However, Depp is not the only actor stealing scenes in this movie. Geoffrey Rush plays Captain Barbosa and does phenomenal in the role. Rush has campy and great lines and makes them all flow naturally. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have good chemistry and make a believable romance. Although the love story is not completely fleshed out, it still adds something on top of action. The action is thrilling and although the effects are a bit dated (this movie was made in 2003) they are not terrible by any means. I think one thing that makes this movie so rewatchable is the amazing score composed by Klaus Badelt and produced by Hans Zimmer. The music adds adventure and excitement as well as tension and suspense. This movie is fun and immersive, much like the ride at DisneyLand and DisneyWorld. The script is well-written, there are some campy lines, but then that is to be expected in a swashbuckling pirate flick. This is the best film in the series for sure. It is by no means a perfect film, but it is a fun and exciting movie that will keep you glued to the screen until the last frame. Overall, I give this movie an 8/10.",

            "content": "Much like another early 2000s hit, Shrek (2001), it is difficult to remember what all the fuss was about when it came to this film as a series of awful sequels and the fact that Johnny Depp essentially plays this role in life. At the time however it was a big sensation and critically acclaimed enough to earn Depp an Academy Award nomination and while I had a lot of fun with it as an eleven year old I did not like it as much when I rewatched it recently. I liked seeing a young Keira Knightley and the film did have a unique look but there are better swashbucklers out there than this.\n\nThe aristocratic Elizabeth Swann, Keira Knightley, saves the poor Will Turner, Orlando Bloom, by taking his medallion and he goes on to become a blacksmith. She encounters the alcoholic pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, when she accidentally falls into the water and he rescues her but he is arrested when her husband discovers him. She is later captured by an enemy ship but due to a case of mistaken identity she finds herself being used to ward off a curse that has befallen them. Turner has fallen in love with her and enlists Sparrow to help recapture her but he sets his sights on recapturing his former ship \"The Black Pearl\" that he held great affection for. Swann enjoys her new lifestyle greatly and is happy to be caught up in the conflict between Sparrow and his enemies. Swann is exchanged various times between the two sides and briefly flirts with Sparrow but ultimately ends up with Turner who fights for her and presents as a far more attractive love interest than the older drunk who may be a great pirate but lacks charm.\n\nKnightley was the stand out from the film to me as she has star power in spades and some of the talent that she would put to great use in later films like Atonement (2007) and Anna Karenina (2012) shines through her. She was certainly cast for her beauty and cut glass accent, traits that fit an unattainable but appealing society beauty well, yet she brings more to the role than another sex symbol from this era would have. There is a joy and a liveliness to her performance that is lacking in Bloom's effort and when you see her pick up a sword and beginning to thrust and parry you do find her somewhat convincing. She has touches of Olivia de Havilland in Captain Blood (1935) and while this film is considerably lesser than that Errol Flynn classic her capable love interest does give the film some flavor. In the era of Michael Bay films that shamelessly ogled women who served purely as sex objects there is a novelty to seeing a capable actress bring some attitude to an underwritten role and make us genuinely care about at least one of the characters in the film.\n\nIssues with the film include the fact that Sparrow is unlikable and hard to care about and Bloom is so bland that he fails as the hot young leading man. Some were swept off their feet by his lovable hellraiser and noted his \u2018genius' in doing an impression of Keith Richards for two and a half hours. With Academy Award nominations for Ben Kingsley in House of Sand and Fog (2003) and Bill Murray in Lost in Translation (2003) it is hard to see why Depp makes his way into the lineup. Fortunately he probably didn't stand a chance at winning but at least critics and audiences have caught up the fact that Depp's performance in lazy through viewing him in the lifeless sequels. It is easy to see why Bloom never quite became the major leading man that Hollywood was setting up to be as other than his hair he presents nothing of interest in this film and appears weak next to Knightley. \n\nI can't say there was anything about the film's plot that really drew me in as it was both overly simplistic and convoluted at the same time. This is what people have come to expect of the outdated genre but I long for the simplicity of The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938).",

            "content": "This is a very interesting movie. If this film was bad, the franchise wouldn\u00c2\u00b4t exist, or at least, it wouldn\u00c2\u00b4t be such long. Down below, i\u00c2\u00b4ll show which elelements are my reasons that make this movie a great film.\n\n-Scenography: All the scenographys shown in this movie, are totally realistic. Without effort, you deduce that they\u00c2\u00b4re from century XXVII, in England. It is a visual delight all the ships, extra actors\u00c2\u00b4 cloth, the curse\u00c2\u00b4 CGI, and of course al the cities, and the other secondary places where the plot advances .\n\n-Characters: Ronna Kress did a good job with the  casting. All the main characters are the best on their roles, Johnny Depp gives a very nice personality to the Captain Jack Sparrow. Keira Knigthley and Orlando Bloom make some cliches, but they work. Barbossa is maybe the best character on the movie, because the solid appearances and the dialogs he mention, are well done by  Geoffrey Rush. The secondary characters would be better in the aspect of priority, because the Barbossa\u00c2\u00b4s crew and the english army sometimes steal leadership.\n\n-Plot: the writers also reflected their effort. Making the personalities of each character wasn\u00c2\u00b4t an easy task, but they do it ok. However, this movie in some parts, its incongruous. There are many scenes that are almost impossible, for example, when will and Jack fight for first time. \nThe history its very agile; they pass through several places and this do not fill us up of information. Its a simple plot but with very well ejecutaion. \n\n-Rhythm of the plot: This is one of the best points i saw about the movie. For better comprehension, i\u00c2\u00b4ll compare this movie, with the 3rd of this franchise.\nAt the 3rd movie, the rhythm was very slow. This makes the movie boring. The rhythm sharply grows up with the final battle, and this part keeps for long time. This is the best part of the movie and one of the best scenes of the franchise. If this rhythm kept among all the movie, this would be the best one. The rhythm of the first movie, which i\u00c2\u00b4m reviewing, its fast but regular, and grows up at the climax. This makes the movie agile and consistent. There are only a few scenes that slows down a bit the plot. For example, when Jack and Will travel by the sea with the stolen ship.\n\n-Action scenes: This point could be better, but its ok. The action scenes in some cases are ridiculous, very wierd, but comical in some cases. It might be better without these strange moevement, but watching the other movies, you familiarize with that.\n\n-Script: Many movies have the mistake of the half-done scripts. In this movie, there are moments that i wished the script should be more complete, but in the most part of the dialogs, the script looked ok.\n\nMy final comment resume: Its a great film, visually incredible, and you can easily familiarize with the characters, the plot its fast and it keeps regular, but there are few moments that slow down the script for a while. My grade its 8.2. \nThank you for reading this review. \nIsaac Razo.",

            "content": "What makes up an excellent movie? Story (Plot), characters, acting, originality, music, production design, costume design, and the list goes on. In the Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl all criteria, of what makes an excellent movie, is met and I can explain why.\n\nAs a film major and studying the technicalities of a film the Pirates of the Caribbean takes number one in originality. I have never experienced a story so thrilling and adventurous that takes us on a ride that I have never seen before. This ride is the ride of a lifetime and you do not want to miss traveling the ocean sea on a pirate ship. Some might argue and say Jaws did better, but we are not talking about sea creatures. This movie takes all those old pirate movies and leaves them stranded on an island, that no one knows about, to fend for themselves as it sails away over the horizon.\n\nAs sword clang, cannons fire, pistols shot, and plunders throughout the move on ships and ports. Some can now image the realism pirates were back in the time when old pirates sailed ships to do whatever they wanted, drink till drunk, raid, and believe in tales and curses as they sailed the seas for treasure. This brought a whole new world that everyone can appreciate it and dive into it putting all other movies that were related to pirates behind them. The movie was brought to life by two distinguished actors by the name of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who is out to get his ship back from his nemesis Captain Barbosa, played by Geoffrey Rush, who has been cursed from stealing Aztec gold.\n\nThe story of this movie goes as young blacksmith William Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, is on a quest for love to get back and rescue the love of his life Young Elizabeth Swan, played by Keira Knightley, a governor's beautiful daughter of Port Royal. Ms. Swan has been kidnapped by Jack Sparrow's long-term nemesis Captain Barbosa in hopes to lift the curse that has been under him and his crew.\n\nAs we follow the main character, William Turner. We as the audience sympathize with him and follow his quest for love. Young William Turner is forced to team up with Captain Jack Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth Swan. As the duo of the two protagonists of the story we get a story that pushes both these characters to change and progress within the movie. Everyone loves character development in stories and this movie does with all characters in this movie even the two pirate duos, the fat and the skinny one that keeps losing his eye. Played by Lee Arenberg, as Pintel (the fat one), and Mackenzie Crook, as Ragetti (the skinny one with the wooden eye). \n\nWe cannot ignore Johnny Depp's performance in this movie. Simply is amazing. Giving the world many, and I mean many, memorable moments. Such as the first time we see him docking his ship at Port Royal standing on the main mast of the ship as is slowly sinks barely reaching the dock for him to land safely without getting a shingle drop of water on him. I love all of his plans that you think \"what is Captain Jack Sparrow doing? Is he fit to be called a pirate?\" and what do you know a cleverly devised plan behind a plan that looks outrageous to even begin with. Sometimes I just think it is merely luck, but there is more to Jack as we are led on in this movie.\n\nJohnny Depp will forever be known to the world now as \"Captain\" Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's performance might have stolen the show in most every scene, but if it was not for the believable acting from that finally brought the cruelty of what named a pirate in the first place by Captain Barbosa this whole story would have fallen apart. The duality and the differences in both characters but also keeping that underline foundation of what a pirate is brings the story to a more thrilling chase around the seven seas. Let's not also forget that Geoffrey continued his role as Captain Barbosa in the rest of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies alongside the famous character that Johnny Depp played because he was also as unforgettable as the notorious pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow. Good movies that has a hero and going on his quest like William turner. We need a good or even a better villain, which is what actor Geoffrey Rush did with his character. Much like the movie Avengers: Infinity War, which was only successful due to the villain (or main character) in the film.\n\nThe character of Captain jack Sparrow comes to life as he makes his way through the movie with his own theme, composed by Klaus Badelt. His music for this movie will forever be embedded into your brain and will forever live on in the Disney parks. No wonder Klaus Badelt was chosen by the famous Hans Zimmer, who is known to compose most all films for the famous director Christopher Nolan, to be his understudy and even his successor one day.\n\nWe can see in The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, that much thought and research has come out of this movie to make a realistic pirate world. The details in the imagery of the costumes and set designs just made that fantasy pirate world of the production Jerry Bruckheimer just made it feel like the old English time when there were actually pirates.\n\nAs a grown adult, watching this movie reminded me of playing pirates back when I was a kid, playing sword fights with my other siblings. Chucking pillows as if they were cannons fired from my cannons. Those were the days.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl has all of the ingredients that categorizes movies to be to be a fresh movie. Hop on and join the ride of the lifetime to sail the seven seas with the notorious pirate called Captain Jack Sparrow.",

Johnny Depps performance excellently captures the spirit of the character and the supporting cast, specifically Kiera Knightley, are also really good as well as there being a villain that isn't just a generic threat but an actually fleshed out character with a personal goal.

            "content": "\"Even I love Johnny Depp, and I'm male,\" a previous reviewer declares, tongue in cheek. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far, but there's no doubt whatsoever that when I lost my heart to this film, Johnny Depp's outrageous Cap'n Jack Sparrow had almost everything to do with it. I don't normally review 'current' films, so the very fact that I'm writing this highlights an almost unprecedented event - after endless failures, Hollywood has finally rediscovered the spirit of the classic swashbuckler movie.\n\nWith hindsight, I think the one brilliant decision that was made at some point - given a modern production environment - was to *separate the roles* of hero and swashbuckler. You can then have your worthy Costner-type juvenile lead, as required, who has to Come To Terms with his Past (although his eventual fate is a trifle unexpected in conventional terms...) - *but* you can also have your essential and irrepressible swaggering rogue (of course, he totally steals the film from the moment he first appears, but *that's* no hardship!)\n\nThe moonlight special effects were overdone, in my opinion - not that they aren't believable, but that they would have been more effective if used more sparingly, for occasional flashes of nastiness rather than solid minutes of battle. However, that's a minor niggle. The stunts are energetic, highly satisfactory, *not* computerised, and on occasion even carried out by the stars :-)\n\nThe other saving grace of the production is its humour - not that there aren't a few over-arch knowing references, but on the whole it manages to send itself up without suspending disbelief in the process. Jack Sparrow's first arrival on the scene (with total aplomb aboard a steadily-sinking boat) is a prime example, as indeed are the vast majority of subsequent scenes involving this character...\n\nThe basic Romance and Rescue structure is satisfactory enough, with the addition of the requisite Feisty Female for the 21st century (though I felt the character would have been a little more historically plausible if she had been a little less liberated - she clearly possesses a stronger character than her young man, she doesn't have to strive to be his physical equal as well...) However, it is the pirates themselves who really make the film, simply by being a pack of unreconstructed and uninhibited villains (from the Jeffrey Farnol School of Historical Dialect) who are far larger than life and totally unselfconscious about it. To quote the opening words of the 'Guardian' review: \"we have been waiting [50 years] for a modern pirate film featuring someone who, in all seriousness, actually says the words, or perhaps the two-syllable single word: 'Ah-harrrrr!'\"\n\nJack Sparrow, as swashbuckler extraordinaire and consummate rogue (of course, totally honest in his own way... ahem) is the main attraction of the entire film. Not so much loopy as totally round the bend - outrageous and unpredictable (there is a running gag throughout the first part of the film where he is repeatedly described as \"the worst pirate I've ever seen\", as in \"the worst at it\", only for the preposterous tactics in question to prove spectacularly successful).\n\nThis character saves the hero in more ways than one - without him, the film would be another \"Mask of Zorro\", a rather stodgy attempt to update an old favourite for modern-day sensibilities and compensate with more and flashier sword-fighting (swashbuckling is not *about* fighting! It comes into it, yes, but it's not the point.) But together, the pair work off one another beautifully - reliability and inspired lunacy, self-doubt and cocky flamboyance, dogged devotion and shameless self-interest. The only question is which, precisely, is the sidekick...\n\nThere are two beginnings to this film, neither of them bearing any relation to the wooden costume-drama-by-numbers prologue that actually opens the movie. The moment when events start to move (it could scarcely be less subtle) is signalled by the swell of the theme music for the first time at Sparrow's initial appearance. But for me the moment when the film really took off was in that instant during his first escape, when he seizes the rope and swings up, up, and out, in a classic swashbuckler move from the past that brought it all flooding back... and my heart flew up after him into my throat, and remained enjoyably in that position until the end of the movie, when the audience began spontaneously to applaud.\n\nThe film is far from perfect - characters like Captain Norrington (*please* - 'Commodore', like 'Prime Minister', is a job description, not a form of address!) and the Governor are little more than pantomime stereotypes, with only frustrating hints of humanity to indicate that they do after all have potential denied them by the script. Annoying anachronisms slip in - \"it's okay\", \"I was rooting for you\" - most of the nautical jargon comes out with about as much sign of comprehension as a phonetic rendition of a foreign language, and Sparrow's one precious charge of powder gets soaked through often enough in the course of the plot to be utterly useless by the end. Both hero and heroine come across as wooden and thankless roles. Orlando Bloom may be costumed to look increasingly like Errol Flynn during the course of the film (was it my imagination, or does he spend it gradually cultivating a duplicate of that famous moustache?), but, alas, any resemblance ends there.\n\nBut then it doesn't really matter. It is Depp, not Bloom, who has inherited the mantle of Flynn and Fairbanks in this film. Jack Sparrow was the character who caught my imagination - and, since I'm extremely impressionable, also had a distinctly peculiar effect on the way I stood and walked for several hours later. And there's not many films can say *that*..! \u00ffay.I am nearly fifty years old. A sober grown man. With children. Children with whom I have now sat through hundreds of movies. Many of which I have enjoyed. And I am not completely hardened in my sophistication. The opening music to The Lion King brought tears to my eyes when my little ones were but wee tots. But still, these are after all just children's movies. In another life, I would never have seen them. And, really, one can't take such movies too seriously, can one?\n\nAnd so, this summer, after the ritual badgering, I dutifully trudged into yet another Disney \"adventure\" movie. Named after that tired old ride in Anaheim I first went on in 1965. I mean really, how much can you expect?\n\nAnd then, it happened. The swirling intoxication. The stunned feeling. What? Who? How? Was this a movie? Or a religious experience? Perhaps more like an addictive experience...\n\nI cannot remember ever willingly paying to see any movie not starring a relative of mine more than twice, and I can count those movies on one hand. I have now seen \"Pirates\" four times. The only thing keeping me from seeing it again is the sense that this whole thing is just getting out of hand. I cannot get enough of it. It's like walking into a painting that you never want to come back out of. My children ask, with a note of concern in their voices, \"Dad, you really like Pirates of the Caribbean a lot, don't you?\"\n\nAnd that Depp fellow. My God. I never had any idea who he was, but his name sounded like something created for a pubescent cover-boy for magazines published to hook thirteen year-old girls on make-up and bad music. Wasn't Depp the name of some hair-goo product back in the 60s?\n\nI am a straight male. I have several good friends who are gay, but have never fantasized about any gender but the female. But now I understand how women can experience swooning crushes on male film stars. He is simply extraordinary. So sly, so seductive, so canny! I read an interview in which Depp said he went through a slight depression when he had to stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow. I can see why. His inventiveness and sheer pleasure in inhabiting the character come through in every frame. How can I admit to my children that I now troll through fan websites about a former teen heart-throb?\n\nI often don't even watch the Academy Awards, and I certainly never have any emotional investment in who wins.\n\nExcept for this year.\n\nGo Jack.\n\nAnd, in a time when many big-budget movies are little more than a hodge-podge of loosely- connected \"money shots\" this movie puts all the pieces together, with a sense of fun and light-heartedness in special effects that are simply dazzling. I find myself laughing with dizzy appreciation when Barbossa barks out, \"You'd best be believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner, you're in one!\" and the grinning skeletons come into view, with Badelt's pounding score keeping time to the beat of their maniacal deck-swabbing. And then there's the scene of the pirate-ghouls slithering up from the darkened sea on the mooring cables of the Dauntless, like infernal cats stalking their prey.\n\nAnd now to the music. I can just hear the effete aesthetes dismissing this score, as Mr. Zimmerman anticipates with his winking \"overproduced by\" credit on the cover-liner. \"Bombastic.\" \"Overdone.\" \"Absurdly Stupendous.\"\n\nWell, perhaps it is, for those who spend their lives evaluating such things. To me, it is absolutely transporting. I first listened to it while doing a work-out on a rowing machine and found that I tripled my usual distance. It was like mainlining some hazardous tachycardic amphetamine.\n\nOnce again, the children were wondering, \"What's up with Daddy? Is he OK?\"\n\nPerhaps I am just losing my grip, having an adolescent movie get to me this way. But when those final credits roll, and Captain Jack narrows his eyes and says, \"Now, bring me that horizon. Drink up me hearties, yo ho\" and the music swells ... it is difficult to put into words the effect it has.\n\nAt this point my children have to yank me forcibly from the theater, lest I persist in watching the credits to the bitter end, and bid good-bye to the little monkey once more, wiping tears of exultation from my eyes.\n\nThis is not just another \"entry\" in the summer blockbust sweepstakes. It is an exquisite work of fantasy and inventiveness, a true classic, on the order of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" I do hope Depp's performance garners not just awards, but a place in the pantheon, something we old fogies -- and our gently fogeying children decades hence -- will show to our children and grandchildren like a revealed treasure. I cannot recall any movie having such an effect on me.",

            "content": "We have to take a look at very first voyage before venturing into Salazar's Revenge, where it all begin with Captain Jack Sparrow back in 2003. But it didn't all start back in 2003. No. And for those of you, like myself, that we're fortunate or spoilt enough to visit Disney World you might know where I'm coming from. \n\nIt was one of my favourite, if not the favourite ride out of the attractions at the Disney resorts The dark ride was first opened at Disneyland in 1967 and was the last one constructed under the watchful eye of Walt Disney himself who died 3 months before the ride opened. A dark ride by definition, is a ride that takes passengers on a guided, indoor tour by a carriage of some themed sort, usually a train of seats and in this example, is a boat with a small chance of getting wet. \n\nI remember boarding the boat and as the boat departs for a pitch black tunnel, there was a skull and crossbones warning you and then chuckling to himself. Now, what follows is guided tour throughout the pirate kingdom of coves, treasure caves, ports and taverns telling the story of Pirates of the Caribbean, though it would have be surely updated and twinned with the movies. So, it's not based on a maritime novel or a video game, not even a comic but a theme park ride. \n\nThe film really captures the essence of the attraction, using some familiar characteristics and elements such as the the rum, the boisterous, drunkard-riddled taverns, the pirate songs and including the stubborn dog with the bunch of keys. My voyage there was more than twenty years ago so I can only imagine how they have upgraded or replaced the, still good, animatronics and purposefully grubby sets. \n\nAccording to writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, they had a script drafted up since the early 90's which ended up in the hands of Spielberg, who had Steve Martin, Bill Murray or the late Robin Williams to play Capt. Jack Sparrow. Fortunately, Disney halted any projects, possibly because of the disappointing result of Hook. \n\nIt's not a complicated story, but it's not simple one either, with a crew of cursed undead pirates lead by a Capt. Barbossa, claiming the sea, searching for their damned treasure in hope of lifting their curse. But what an amazing curse it is, to be consumed by greed never being able to quench their thirst or cure their hunger and lust. It appears to be a big ocean out there but a relative small world as characters inadvertently cross paths throughout the franchise leaving clues to each other's history. \n\nIt's opens with the a brief but integral piece of Will Turner's origins. The now orphaned pirate boy rescued and raised on Port Royal remembering very little from where he came from, unknowing he is a small yet important part to Capt. Barbossa's quest and just by some coincidental, unfortunate events all the key characters converge and thus starts the grand adventure. \n\nRight from Captain Jack Sparrow's entrance, most of us are immediately enchanted by his quirks, mannerisms and facial expressions. His cheeky yet cunning, mischievous behaviour has been said to be influenced by the rocking greats such as his good friend Keith Richards. He's quite possibly, the best pirate you've ever seen. De Niro was originally offered the part before Depp and he gladly declined due to having doubts about the success of such a film. He wasn't the only one with doubts with the studio planning a straight to DVD release with title as just Pirates of the Caribbean with the mindset of this being a one off, though the later anticipated box office success added the Curse of the Black Pearl. \n\nWho didn't want to be Captain Jack Sparrow after watching this. His attitude and savvy was infectious, spawning thousands of pirate cosplayers and especially Captain Jack Sparrow impersonators. Depp himself has been reported to carry the costume around with him wherever he travels, donning the attire and visiting children's hospitals when able to take the opportunity. One brilliant and true story is of a girl who wrote to Depp asking for piracy advice on how to commit a mutiny against her teachers. Depp surprised both pupils and teachers by trying up, in full Capt. Jack Sparrow attire and character. \n\nI think we can all agree, no one else can play or even be seen to play Capt. Jack Sparrow, even versus the prewritten role for Hugh Jackman and the Disney's hopeful, Matthew McConaughey which is a strong sign of great character and good acting. Rush fits the bill as Barbossa, but what of the rest of the cast? There was plenty of desirables for both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann including Jude Law, Tobey Maguire, Christian Bale, Jessica Alba and Jaimie Alexander though Bloom won the part over Heath Ledger due to him being considered a more bankable star off the back of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Knightly is sadly the weakest of the crew and could imagine others playing Swann. There's just something about her that doesn't fit right and her screen presence can actually be annoying. \n\nThe production is of an epic scale, filming on location wherever possible, though some sets doubled for the Caribbean. The costumes and props are incredibly realistic, especially using real ships like the Lady Washington that doubles at the H.M.S. Interceptor with The Black Pearl being the Millennium Falcon of the Caribbean. In fact, if you think about it, there's quite a lot of similarities to Star Wars series regarding the smuggling/piracy. It has to be noted, this was and still is one of the best produced films of all time, but that shouldn't be too surprising with Jerry Bruckheimer at the ship's wheel. \n\nKlaus Badelt composes one of my favourite all-time scores and admittedly, I went through a spate of listening to this soundtrack constantly on repeat. It's themes embody adventure, excitement, horror and comedy superbly put together that almost creates a story on its own. \n\nWitty and clever script writing which was made all the more entertaining by allowing the cast the freedom to improvise should the opportune moment arise. Depp's \"Savvy\" catchphrase and Bloom's impersonation being only two examples that wasn't scripted. It's slapstick, fast action is incredibly refreshing and exciting, especially the swordsmanship, which reminded me very much of The Princess Bride but much more creative and adventurous taking much advantage of their environment. It displays some of the best choreographed fencing in movie history. \n\nYour scallywags will love it. It is both, madness and brilliant, bringing pirates and swashbuckling adventures back into fashion, becoming the definitive pirate movie ever made. \n\nQuoting the Skull and Crossbones as you enter the ride. \n\"Psst! Avast there! It be too late to alter course, mateys. And there be plundering pirates lurkin' in ev'ry cove, waitin' to board. Sit closer together and keep your ruddy hands in board. That be the best way to repel boarders. And mark well me words, mateys: Dead men tell no tales! Ye come seekin' adventure with salty old pirates, eh? Sure you've come to the proper place.

            "content": "What has now become a multi-billion-dollar franchise once started as an ambitious risk by Disney.  Make a feature length film based on a ride at your theme park?  That just didn't seem like something logical to do at the time.  However, with a talented group of actors, a swashbuckling script, and one hell of a musical score, the first Pirates of the Caribbean is an absolute joy on all fronts.  Perhaps, never really being topped in any way by its successors.\n\nStarting a new franchise is bold these days, which is why Disney made the right move in hiring Johnny Depp as the charming and sometimes irreverent Captain Jack Sparrow.  An even better move was not leaving the entire film up to Sparrow to lead.  Complementing the zaniness of Sparrow is the elegant but fierce Elizabeth Swan and the mysterious and brave Will Turner (played by Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom respectively).  All of them are great, but may not prove to be as fun if not for the incredible visual effects, makeup, and action.  This felt like the first major blockbuster of the 21st century, and the rest of the series certainly ranks up there.\n\nOne of the best things this series, and particularly the first film, did so well is create a mythology and universe surrounding Pirates in and around the Caribbean.  It happens gradually in 'Black Pearl', seemingly allowing viewers to adapt to the unknown shores of the series without feeling overwhelmed.  A lot of it's fun swordplay and grim family history, but the supernatural elements play just as well.  Immortally cursed pirates just begin to mark the lovable weirdness of this film.\n\nAlmost as well known as the characters and the film itself is the score by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer.  Zimmer is always remembered as the one who created the iconic theme, but Badelt should also be credited, as should a few other unknown composers at the time who chipped in.  But really, the movies would not be the same without the perfect music played over the action and adventures.  \n\nThis film is lengthy and does feature an annoyingly pesky English Navy who won't go away, but Geoffrey Rush's turn as Captain Barbosa and an equally (if not more) memorable turn from Depp as Sparrow makes the first film the best in the series.

They're neither alive nor dead and the only way to break the curse is to get the blood from the living child of 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner. The captain of the Black Pearl is Barbossa in a brilliant performance from Geoffrey Rush and he will stop at nothing to break the curse.\nIn the midst of all the swashbuckling adventures, romance makes an appearance between Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann. The two share a lot of chemistry and their relationship develops over the course of the next two films.",

The cast is really good. The story was fun, but for Pirates of the Caribbean let's just say it is a good popcorn flick. Jack sparrow aka Captain Jack sparrow, is played Johnny Depp. Good but not Oscar worthy. And as for the rest of the cast, like Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush absolutely kicks ass in this film. It's also very funny. Shrek writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio spice up the pirate genre as gamely as they did fairy tales; but on the comedy map it's Johnny Depp's inspired turn as Captain Jack Sparrow that really marks the spot. Depp, arguing that pirates were the rock stars of their day, models his entire performance on Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones: it's there in every slurred vowel and every drug-fried wiggle of the head. There's an endearing dignity to Sparrow's hunger for fame. \"You are, without doubt, the worst pirate I've heard of,\" says one British officer. \"Yes,\" replies Jack, \"but you have heard of me.\" Gloriously over-the-top, this performance is pitched only as high as the film's fun factor itself. In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it's a masterclass in comedy acting. Depp steals the show, Keira Knightley is a lovely actress in this film. Pirates of the Caribbean the franchise itself is not everyones cup of tea, as for myself I am a huge fan of pirates itself. I love the lifestyle, steaming based on the Disney ride is very creative. \n\nPirates of the Caribbean the curse of the Black Pearl is a fun movie to go see. I don't recommend for all pirate lovers, I recommended for the people that want to have a little taste of Disney. \n\nGrade \n8.5/10",

The plot is quite simplistic when compared to the other 'Pirates' films, but it doesn't get muddled in its own story. It's a love story at its heart, between a privileged daughter of a Governor of one of the many Caribbean islands (Keira Knightley), and an orphaned apprentice of the local Blacksmith (Orlando Bloom). There is a sense of history between them goes back to childhood, and is a very strong bond between both, which becomes the main driving force behind the events in Part 1. The pirates have a real sense of danger about them, and are just as dangerous and evil looking when they are in or out of their ghoulish form. and I think most will be surprised at the level of violence (off screen that is) which this movie contains.\n\nThe first entry into the series introduces us to the most pivotal character in the series; Captain Jack Sparrow, and is by far one of Johnny Depp's best creations. A perfect blend of heroism, ineptitude, and just a hint of madness. He brought such a unique character to life, and it is very easy to believe that you need to be somewhat crazy to be a successful pirate. From the very introduction to the character to his last scene in the series, you know that there is something off about him. Every single interaction, every little quip has a real sense of improvisation, about it, as though everything that happens around him is more of a nuisance to deal with, rather than a consequence of his own actions. The remaining characters are very much real in this single minded drives. Elizabeth swan as the damsel in distress, William turner as a driven hero willing to stop at nothing to get to the women he loves, and of course Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush) who is evil to his core and willing to stop at nothing to relieve the curse upon him and his crew (but mostly for himself).\n\nAlthough shorter than the other movies in the series, this one is by far the best without stretching the story too thin or becoming too convoluted in plot. It is in many ways a cleaner and simpler story. A great film from beginning to end with just the right blend of love, adventure and magic.\n\n3.5/5",

And they are both funny! The music was great as well it was creepy music as well as cool!! So some of the music was creepy! And Jack,Will Vs Barbosa was a good fight! Barbosa is creepy!!

Acting within The Curse of the Black Pearl for the most part was great, and of course the cast seemed to grow into their characters more and more as this film started to take shape. I do love how the story starts and unfolds as I do believe at this point this is one of my favorites within the film collection, of course until I get to check out the newest in development film.\n\nThe Curse of the Black Pearl is a wonderful movie, it's great for family, it's filled with action, comedy, and a beautiful tale to follow. I love how the characters stories individually began to unfold nicely timed throughout the film revealing the love term development of the Pirates films. The Curse exposed was my favorite part of the movie the graphics were awesome.",

            "content": "When I was 8 years old, I watched Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl on DVD and I was simultaneously transfixed and horrified. I have to admit that the skeleton pirates scared the crap out of me. But it wasn't until I saw Dead Man's Chest in theaters soon after that I became obsessed with Pirates of the Caribbean. And when I say obsessed, I mean OBSESSED. Third grade me spent 95% of the time in a Jack Sparrow costume. And I am not ashamed to admit that I also had all the accompanying effects: Jack Sparrow's sword, pistol, compass, and telescope. I even had the stinking gold medallion. I WAS OBSESSED. I don't really know what it was about Pirates of the Caribbean that hooked me, but it was the start of a love of movies in general and I'm so thankful for these films. Because of this early infatuation, I've always had a soft spot for this franchise even as I've grown older and its flaws have become more obvious. However, I am still under the disposition that Curse of the Black Pearl, the very first Pirates movie, is a film with very little imperfections. For starters, it's an incredibly fun experience. I genuinely think it's one of the most purely fun films ever made, up there with Back to the Future and Star Wars. It's one of those movies that when it's on, you can't help but enjoy yourself. Black Pearl also introduced the world to one of the most hilarious movie characters of all time: CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow. While Johny Depp's schtick has gotten old over the years, it still feels unbelievably fresh in this first installment. Honestly, Jack Sparrow feels restrained in this movie when compared to how he acts in the later ones. It's such a joy to watch Jack in Black Pearl, because he actually seems to be using his wit against the other characters instead of just getting extremely lucky. The film's other two main characters, Will and Elizabeth, are more clich\u00e9 than a clich\u00e9, yet they are clich\u00e9 in a way that works. Both of them have this innocence about them that works really well with Jack's swagger and drunkenness. Black Pearl also introduces Barbosa, played by Geoffrey Rush, who is deliciously over-the-top and pirate-y. But the ones I've mentioned aren't the only great Pirates' characters. One of the things I love most about the original three Pirates movies is the comradery between all the characters, including Mr. Gibbs, Norrington, Cotton, Jack the Monkey, and even Raggeti and Pintel, the two bumbling idiots who work for Barbosa and manage to make there way through almost every single film. When watching this movie back to back with the sequels, it's interesting to see how small-scale the action is in Black Pearl. It's great and exciting action, but it's mostly just sword fights and regular ship battles. That's not say that this movie doesn't boast some pretty cool stuff. I mean it has freaking skeleton pirates! While the special effects were fantastic back in 2003, they definitely look dated now, but it in no way take you out of the movie. I think it's clear that I really do love this film. It's fun, it's gorgeous, and it has hilarious characters. (Watching it last night, I just noticed for the first time that Jack makes a joke about Will being a eunuch and I died laughing.) Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is definitely the best Pirates movie, and at just 14 years old, it's already a classic.",

But to my pleasant surprise, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is a well-made adventure film with intriguing characters, well executed action, and is subsequently thoroughly entertaining throughout. The films plot is fairly original and has enough twists and turns to keep things unpredictable and interesting, despite being a bit convoluted, pretentious, and tough to follow at times. Many people complain that the film's too long, which adds on to the other slight problems that it has. But honestly, I never had a problem with the film's run time and I can't think of a single thing I would cut out of it. The main cast are all great. Whether it's Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swan, who's beautiful and yet can hold her own against the pirates. Orlando Bloom as William Turner, who's a relatable character, playing the \"hero\" role and just wanting to get the girl. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa plays the creepy yet entertaining villainous captain of the Black Pearl. Jack Davenport as the smarmy and condescending Commodore Norrington has a prominent presence on screen. And last but certainly not least, Johnny Depp's unbelievably immersing portrayal of the whimsical and unpredictable Captain Jack Sparrow is absolutely hilarious and never gets stale. Simply put, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is an extremely entertaining flick that gives genuine thrills without ever feeling forced and is simply a pure example of a good summer blockbuster.",

            "content": "\"Gentlemen! You shall always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!\"\r\n\r\nWhen thinking of the greatest action-adventure movies of all-time, the first films that pop off the bat include films like The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Mark of Zorro, and just about every superhero film released by Marvel Studios (particularly The Avengers). When first looking at a film like Pirates of the Caribbean, you'd think that the film would be just an average action film that's a little dull in characterization and the plot's too convoluted, plus the fact that the film was based on a theme park ride didn't give hope to a lot of average filmgoers that never rode that awesome ride that's in the Disney theme parks. But the good news is, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is not just a great adventure action movie, it's a modern adventure masterpiece that should be ranked among the best of the best Hollywood adventure films.\r\n\r\nGovernor's daughter Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) has a little run in with pirates that are after a little gold piece that she discovered eight years prior on a voyage, and is taken to the captain of The Black Pearl, Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Though she's engaged to Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) has a huge fancy for her, and wanting to show off for her, teams up with the wild and crazy pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), real captain of the pearl, to defeat Barbossa and save Elizabeth. Problem is... the crew of the Pearl are cursed by Aztec gold, the blood can only be repaid by Elizabeth's blood, and Jack has a pistol with only one shot.\r\n\r\nThe film also stars Kevin McNally as pirate Gibbs, Jonathan Pryce as Governor Swann, and Zoe Saldana as female pirate Anamaria, who hates that Jack \"stole\" her boat prior to the events of the film.\r\n\r\nWhat's great about this film is that while it's an action film, time was spent at making a grand story to carry out the action, and it's a pretty good one at that. Immediately, director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer (king of \"action\") succeed at making us root for the characters that want to sail the high seas. Acting is also pretty strong, especially Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa (who has a great piratey accent going on in this one), Keira Knightley as Elizabeth (who manages to be a strong action star despite being the damsel-in-distress character), and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, who's about as awesome as the butt-whooping blacksmith-pirate as with Legolas. But the true star of the show is definitely Johnny Depp as the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow, who from his opening scene, you know that he's going to create an unforgettable character. What's great about it is that, like Cary Grant in Charade, you have a great time trying to figure whether he's good or bad. Plus Depp has a extremely fun time in the role, being extremely hilarious to laugh at in the more comedic moments, and is also awesome in the action sequences.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of action, it's just awesome. The swordfights are as great as some of the old adventure classics, and the stuntwork is just stunning. Industrial Light & Magic also does a great job in the visual effects, particularly the animation for the cursed skeleton army, which is so good that it looks like extreme makeup was used. The score by Klaus Badelt is one of the most awesome scores in an action movie, with catchy themes and some fun little adventurous sounds that make the film so fun to watch.\r\n\r\nIt may have had its skeptics, but Pirates of the Caribbean is modern Hollywood action at its greatest, with great action, great original storytelling, great visuals, great music, great characters, and great acting, particularly Johnny Depp's unforgettable role as Jack Sparrow, the most awesome pirate ever depicted on film. It's definitely one of the best action films of the 2000's, and I guarantee that you'll definitely have a real blast when it's all over, and you'll definitely sing \"A Pirate's Life for Me\" in the end, even if it's only used once and the whole song isn't sung.\r\n\r\n\"You better start believing in ghost stories Miss Turner, you're in one!\"",

Keira Knightley is alright, of the main 4 she is the weakest but unlike in the two sequels I can stand her in this one. Geoffrey Rush is fantastic as Captain Barbossa, you can tell he's having fun and he's a great villain. The action is great, the humour is great and it's heaps of fun.

A familiar tale of pirates fighting to claim what is rightfully theirs (a ship, a lifelong crush, life itself), this first installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is rollicking, nautical fun, truly for all ages. The action is both thrilling and amusing, mixing old-time swordplay and naval warfare (albeit, with ghost pirates on one side of the battle) with the style of Tom & Jerry. To add to the cartoonish nature of the film, which, by no means, is a bad quality, Jack Sparrow is now one of the most renowned pirates in all of cinema, largely due to how Johnny Depp shaped his character -- supposedly, Sparrow includes traits of Keith Richards and Pepe Le Pew. Pirates of the Caribbean runs longer than your average Disney film, well over two hours. For the pirate fanatics and admirers, however, that will not pose a problem.",

By bringing together all of the tropes of pirate myth and throwing in some science fiction, \"Pirates\" creates a vast world full of colorful characters, that is sure to please both adults and children alike.  Along with an intriguing narrative, this film has some spectacular action.\n\nBut by far, \"Curse of the Black Pearl's\" biggest strength is in its lead.  Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings together all of the clich\u00e9s of pirates and makes them feel fresh and new.  Depp is witty and charismatic, but also proves capable in serious moments too.  Even though he is a selfish anti-hero, you can't help but root for Captain Jack.  Geoffrey Rush, who plays Barbossa, also adds a lot of depth to his scurvy character.  However, both Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley deliver bland performances, though it isn't enough to bring the film down.\n\n\"Curse of the Black Pearl\" brings to life the mythical world of pirates in a way no other film has before.  It is a fun, thrilling film, with engaging action and plot, and a delightful blend of comedy too.  It is the kind of magical film we've come to expect from Disney.  In the words of Captain Sparrow, \"Welcome to the Caribbean, love.\"",

Must say it's somewhat a new kind of pirates. \nIt's statement yells a magnificent job in both the script and the actor's performance, leading the cruise to an open end. It performs a beautiful job in both climbing the script and twisted plot turns, also giving it a quite some hilarious illusions that blacks the audiences. The film puts it's leg out of the safe zone to try something new, something hilarious, something spectacular. And it did some job in developing the kind of situation that perhaps little of unneeded plot, and bringing the rest of the situation in a comedic hilarious, laughable type of pirates. It develops it's script in levels, bringing in a horny clause and an essence of script's simple yet mysterious plot lines. It does overflow a bit, some abnoxious, maybe a little too focus on that abnoxious, and sometimes even blocking the way of guaranteeing it's way to it's own wanted victory. But breakaway into that is the strangely entertaining blockbuster performance of actor Johnny Depp. He created his own kind of funny, focus on more of the positive side: drinking the rum, falling out a bit; more than: Oh gosh, I lost my ship. Yeah, he's awesome. The supporting cast did too a good job in helping the developments of Depp's character: Orlando Bloom as the fierce Will Turner, Keira Knightley as madam Elizabeth Swann, Geoffrey Rush as the crazy namor captain Barbossa, all did their best of landings. \nEnough to say, best film in the series. 82/100",

It's a film that provides great entertainment with likeable if stock characters and grimy visuals that whilst dated by today's standards, do impress. Johnny Depp does a great job as Jack Sparrow and is what makes the film. He has fun and nails the character well. Geoffrey Rush is a lot of fun to watch as the villain whilst Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley fit in their roles as the good looking romantic couple efficiently. The film is well over two hours but doesn't feel too long which is a plus (something the sequels failed at). The film spends a bit too much time with Bloom and Knightley which does take some enjoyment out of it when Depp should really be the focus of the film. However, the film is so exciting to watch that this doesn't become a major issue. If only the sequels could've been as good as this.",

Watching it now as an adult, I still can get invested in the story and the characters because they are written so well. Jack Sparrow is one of the best characters in film history. Everything from his walk and his mannerisms to his ability to manipulate and adapt to the situations around him. Captain Barbossa is a great villain as well. The perfect counter-weight to Jack Sparrow. Pure evil and won't stop at nothing until he gets what he wants. All the other side characters are great as well. Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Commodore Norrington, etc. The action along with the score of the film are truly outstanding. I've said before that a great score can turn a good film into an amazing one except this movie was great already.

Johnny Depp stands out as a great character named Captain Jack Sparrow, He's able to take this character in to be a mysterious, funny, and an adventure fun character that we like to see more more to come. However having said that I feel as if the reason that we adore Captain Jack Sparrow so much is because of the side characters played by Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley Ian McShane Penelope Cruz and Geoffrey Rush they play the characters so well that they make Jack shine by himself. The actors do a terrific job for playing their characters but I also feel as I watch the movie they depended on johnny depp to lead the way whenever the movies were moving along. when depp is not around these actors characters can be kind of boring. but the same  argument that I've said in the beginning of this review can also be said about jack like it was in the fourth movie it was boring when it's just him. but for the first movie at least this is a fun terrific ride to start of the trilogy and is definitely a way they need to continue the pirates franchise if they want it to be successful",

Curse of the Black Pearl would have to be that film that helped me to grow and overcome that chink in my character, even though I still despise horror films and gore. But while these in my opinion don't detract from a movie, it's over excess that does.\n\nAnyway, back to Pirates of the Caribbean. This is the film that put Johnny Depp and all the other actors in it on the map for me, and give me something to look out for in the future. When I first saw this, I thought it was amazing, and it was a really enjoyable film to watch, especially since it is a Disney film. This is a first in a series of good movies, and is the strongest out of all of them. Everyone plays a solid role and a good character, and the acting in this was brilliant. It really felt I was taken back to the days where England was still colonizing and exploring the world, and pirates were running amok. That in mind, if I was to choose to be any kind of pirate, it would have to be Jack Sparrow. He reshaped and recreated the concept of the pirate, and I believe the film reshaped the idea of the pirate genre in general.\n\nThe story was solid, simple and easy to follow. Geoffrey Rush's character and role as the main antagonist was brilliant, and all the secondary characters were brilliant too. The jokes were fresh, the comedy was good, and the action was brilliant. It also presents a new type of enemy in the form of undead pirates, and while ghost pirates have been used before, I do believe that they were never used to this extent, which makes for a great film.\n\nAll in all, counting the romance, actions, slight bits of scares, characters, acting, story and story elements, Pirates of the Caribbean is a brilliant movie and worth watching again and again.",

The special effects are fantastic for a movie that's already a decade old. I have to admit, if it weren't for Johnny Depp, it wouldn't even be half as good, but the fact that he is there makes all other aspects of the movie (including Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's love story) even better. See it with booming and huge speakers on a huge screen and you'll have a great time. Pirates of the Caribbean is everything a good blockbuster should be, and is.",

The story is well-paced and developed; the swordplay is amazing what with most of the participants being taught by the great swordmaster himelf, Bob Anderson; the characters are all enjoyable and developed in their own little ways, and finally, the climatic ending which happens not to be the real ending is just so mind-engrossing and plain bad***.

The character certainly could have worked if played as a more traditional anti-hero, but the hilarious subversion of the archetype really elevates an already entertaining adventure flick to greater heights. And while Bloom and Knightley are about as unspectacular as a screen paring can get, at least Geoffrey Rush gets to relish in his villainy.\n\nThis was the first must-see blockbuster I can recall from my youth, and experiencing it in theaters with a full audience was a thrill. Gore Verbinski really nailed this one. \"Pirates of the Carribean\" is a superbly-executed dish of crowd-pleasing, swashbuckling pulp.",

The music, the acting, the script, the special effects, and the directing are all executed so well. Johnny Depp created one of the most exciting and memorable characters to ever exist in cinema. It's seriously impossible to watch Captain Jack Sparrow and not have a good time.

This would definitely be his best performance that I've seen of him so far, as well as his most iconic character thanks to his rugged look and perfect mix of physical and vocal excellence.\nIn another charming lead, Orlando Bloom plays an interesting blend of pirate and prince characteristics into his role and comes of with charm and talent. He truly is a skilled actor.\nThirdly, the gorgeous and emotionally talented Keira Knightley brings beauty and civility to her role and evolves from an innocent woman to a badass swashbuckler but never loses her grace in the process.\n\nTo summarise, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a massively fun adventure with a little bit of predictability but a lot of adventure and even a few unexpected twists thrown in there. \nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl restores your faith in the fun of a pirate themed film and Disney's ability to handle a dark concept.",

Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow naturally overshadows everything, and that's a good thing.  Captain Jack is easily one of the most iconic movie franchise characters, up there near Darth Vader.  The plot is quite convoluted, but it should be, because a character like Jack Sparrow is always involved in a complicated series of misadventures.  The CGI of the cursed pirates should also be praised.  They look like the natural evolution of Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion creatures in old adventure movies.  Pirates also features a well-balanced mix of action, adventure, comedy, drama and romance, with a mix of good and villainous characters and a meta wink at the cliches of Hollywood-style good guys and bad guys.",

He is taken captive after a duel with Will Tuner. However, his mutinous former crew raid the city from their ship the Black Pearl. Elizabeth is taken captive and Jack and Will join forces to rescue her, while the Commodore makes his own arrangements. Once again they face the pirates and end up in grave trouble. Jack, Will, and Elizabeth all prove their bravery and cleverness. Ultimately, they are able to take down the immortal pirates and Captain Jack is let go once again. This film was entertaining with good action and enjoyable character. I thoroughly understand how Jack Sparrow has become an icon.",

I also find the film more and more ridiculous.\n\nWhen I first saw the film I was 13 years old, and I was just starting to realize that I wanted to be in the filmmaking business.  Where films like American Beauty, Signs, and the films of Kevin Smith and Mel Brooks, really influenced me in the types of stories I wanted to tell, the original Pirates of the Caribbean really influenced the type of colorful characters I wanted to explore with my stories.  In particular, and I'm sure to no surprise, Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow dazzled me (for the record, and for no particular reason, the other performance that significantly effected me in my life was Heath Ledger's as The Joker).  I can remember imitating him for a long time, something that caused much frustration for my parents I'm sure.  And also probably contributed to my unpopularity in high school.  But I didn't care, I loved the film and the performance, and it once again helped solidify my certainty in wanting to write movies for a living (now that I think about it, this might have been the aspect that frustrated my parents the most.)\n\nAt some points the movie has a complicated plot and can also be quite long.  By listening to the commentary of the film, the director even mentions at one point, that at that particular moment in the film (when Captain Sparrow and Elizabeth are stranded on the beach) the audience has all the information they need to end the story.  Yet the film will continue for another 40 minutes.  The film is flawed, as with ALL films I think.  But with the eclectic characters, the overall plot of pirates and treasure, and the fact that it is just a fun ride, what's there not to love about this film?\n\nWhen I look back now, I have the same feelings I would image a grown up viewer of films like E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark might feel.  When you go back and watch the movies from your own childhood you are aware of the dated effects and sometimes unbelievable sequences, but you also are reminded of the magical feelings that you felt upon first viewing those images.  Now, I do not mean to compare E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, or Raiders of the Lost Ark to POTC, but the feelings for me are similar.  Classics are in a way defined by the generation in which they were released.  Huge amounts of people saw E.T., Goonies, Star Wars, and Raiders, and some have now deemed them classics of their time.  And if you don't want to call POTC a classic of a more recent generation that's fine, for the record I'm not particularly calling it that.  But I do think that this movie, whether we like it or not, will be around for a long time.  And well deserved.",

People have said it's too long, but I enjoyed every minute of it, and still wanted more! A full blown movie excursion. The best film of the franchise. Highly recommended.",

For those of us who were caught up in the intrigue of pirates as kids, this film brings all those hours of role play to vivid life.  Johnny Depp's performance elevates it to a new level, and he is solely responsible for one of the stars on my rating.  Geoffrey Rush has the look of someone born to play a role like this, and brings that mysterious, creepy aspect necessary of any pirate story.  There is also an easy to follow, intriguing plot to be found among all the swashbuckling action, which is something the later films sorely lack.  This is an extremely re-watchable film that never seems to get old.",

The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but that time flies by as you are transported into an awesome world of swashbuckling and sword fights.\n\nJohnny Depp's performance is one of his best ever as the slightly camp Captain Jack Sparrow. Even under his tangle of hair and blackened eyes, he will make you swoon and laugh both at the same time with his tonnes of witty lines and mannerisms. Orlando Bloom plays the love struck son of a pirate, Will Turner and play him he does! This roll highlights the diversity and skill shown by some of the greats. We will definitely see big things from him in years to come. In her second roll in big time flick, Kira Knightley plays kidnapped Govener's daughter, Elizabeth Swan. She is also another young, up and coming star with a bright future ahead of her.\n\nThe film may not be the most historically accurate pirate film of all times but all that is forgotten as you enjoy the brilliance of this marvelous movie. Did I also catch a subtle omage to the 1953 swashbuckler 'The Crimson Pirate' when Will and Jack walk underwater in an upturned rowing boat? Sneaky!\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say, and believe me I don't want to say it, is that fact we are never told the reason why the curse of the black pearl could only be broken by the blood of William Turner (Senior) and in turn by his son. Despite this plot flaw however, Pirates of the Caribbean is a magical journey that will drop the jaws of parents, children and grandparents alike.",

In my opinion, this movie is the best live action Disney film ever made (accept maybe Mary Poppins). Pirates brought me to a magical and fantastic world of swashbuckling pirates. They don't make films like this anymore but Disney stepped up to the challenge and came out with a beautiful product. A staple of my late childhood.",

            "content": "The movie that originated the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was an enjoyable ride which should please the majority. Maybe a little over-hyped but it cannot be rejected for a night in with the family.\r\n\r\nJohnny Depp as Sparrow may have been impressive in the sequels though it's when you first witness his witty portrayal of the outcast pirate that you really are impressed. At times, as I wasn't knowing what to expect, Depp had me in stitches on more than one occasion but an actor of his calibre knows there is a fine line between funny and ridiculous - Depp is the former most definitely.\r\n\r\nThe plot follows Jack Sparrow (Depp) who agrees to join forces with blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) on his quest to rescue his kidnapped sweetheart Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) from the villainous pirates of the Black Pearl. Their leader Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is the main figure on the crew and Jack appears keen to finish him off after previous battles in the past.\r\n\r\nRush - who plays Barbossa - is also particularly witty for a central villain but this is a highlight as it shows Gore Verbinski (the director) wants Pirates of the Caribbean to be a fun adventure which isn't overly serious.\r\n\r\nBloom and Knightley are also well cast; you can see on-screen chemistry between the pair which adds to the feeling that you want them to fall into each others arms. Intertextuality from Romeo and Juliet feels present hear although that's not a bad thing as it slots in with the pirate theme somehow.\r\n\r\nThe verdict is this film is a delight. It has a strong cast, a decent story and excellent effects. What it lacks though is a certain wow factor or heart, it feels a little too mediocre for four stars.",

At times it gets in its own way but overall its very entertaining.  Johnny Depp steals the show with his perfect display of a not-all-there, rum-addicted pirate.  He's funny most of the time and serious when he needs to be.  The first movie is the easiest to jump in and not worry about any continuation and for that reason probably the best of the 3.  You'll enjoy it and its tame enough to still be acceptable for the kids.",

            "content": "To celebrate the release of the third sequel to the swash-buckling adventure series, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Inner Sanctum will be reviewing the first three movies what have made this movie series one of the most successful movie franchises of today, starting with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The one thing that has put some people off this movie is the fact that this movie is actually based on a theme park ride in Disneyland but for all of those worriers, worry not, as this is actually a great adventure movie. While it's true that the story does feel like it's dragging sometimes, it still manages to keep that adventurous feel to it with added humour and a creepy feel to the pirate ghost story. Admittedly, the story does have its flaws but they can be excused since the story is easy to enjoy and fun to watch. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl boasts a good cast of actors who had given out decent and less memorable performances. However, there were two actors who easily managed to shine throughout the movie and those two were Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. Johnny Depp manages to give out a zany, comedic and, somehow, dramatic performance as Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush was scary as Captain Barbossa, Jack Sparrow's rival.\r\n\r\nThe script for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is good with a few scenes where it intrigued you and the direction for a pirate movie is nearly faultless. The problem with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is not with it's script or the direction but with the characters. Captain Jack Sparrow is a fantastic character that's full of life and personality, Captain Barbossa makes a brilliant villain with quite a strong personality, actually making you feel quite sorry for him and his crew a couple of times in the movie. However, the problems are two of the three main characters in the movie: Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, as both of them have a simple personality that isn't relatable in any way and, although Will Turner does have a back story to his childhood, you couldn't really care about it as much as you wanted to. Elizabeth Swann, however, seems to have hardly any personality through the entire movie except for the fact that she's fascinated with pirates, in love with Will Turner and is the Governor's daughter. Fortunately, the movie is very entertaining and a lot of fun for you to notice. Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a great adventure movie that those of all ages will enjoy.\r\n\r\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is definitely one of the better pirate movies and one of the better Disney movie series in a way that, even though this is Disney and they are well known for catering to adults as well as children, the pirate ghost story that is the main focus in this movie is more for a mature audience from young teenagers onwards. Younger ones may enjoy this movie but there are some scenes in the movie that could be a little too scary for them. The special effects in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl are brilliant and nicely used and the action scenes are also done well. Overall, this is one of the best adventure movies and is certainly one of the best pirate movies. From the creepy beginning all the way to the end, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl simply does the job it was supposed to do and takes you on an adventurous journey you'd never want to end.",

            "content": "One of my very favorites. Its a movie with everything. And everything's good. \n\nThis movie had almost nothing going for it. A movie, based on a pirate ride at Disney, doesn't sound to promising. But it exceeds almost all summer blockbusters released before, or since.\n\nThe story is about a pirate named Jack Sparrow. And about a blacksmith named Will Turner. Will is in love with Elizabeth Swan, and Elizabeth is kidnapped by un-dead pirates. Jack has a history with these un-dead pirates, and their captain, Captain Barbossa (played to the hilt by Geoffrey Rush.) The story unfolds, with Jack and Will trying to save Elizabeth.\n\nJohnny Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow...Captain Jack Sparrow has become legendary. And it deserves every bit of praise. Amazing. Orlando Bloom does well with the slightly innocent Will Turner. Kiera Knightley is beautiful and plays a convincing Elizabeth. And the supporting cast of pirates all have fun and Are fun.\n\nOverall this is the pirate movie to end all pirate movies. It's funny, witty, action packed, romantic, swashbuckling, and just a grand time. Also listen for Klaus Badelt's now iconic score. Wonderful stuff. 10/10\n\n\"No, he's a pirate.\"",

This film makes me a fan of Gore Verbinski because of his direction. But there are problems with this film: it could be easily shorter  (there are some unnecessary scenes), not all the comedy works(when Elizabeth`s dad \"fights\"a hand its silly and lame)and way to many characters that are left in the background and not needed(like Anamaria)In conclusion: this film is good in plot and acting so its a great film but I understand why many people dont like it and I personally like some of those aspects.",

We all know and love PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, for many reasons: Johnny Depp's irresistibly gonzo Jack Sparrow, the incredible action sequences, the rousing scores by Hans Zimmer, the gorgeous Caribbean locales, and the modern edge the story gives to the traditional setting and characters of 17th Century Port Royal and the surrounding Caribbean islands.  That's why the quadrilogy has now made more than 1 billion dollars and is now among the echelons of franchises that have made as many fans (who continually return to the films via rentals and their collections) as the profit the films have rightfully earned.    \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, Johnny Depp's creatively gonzo and witty rogue of a pirate Jack Sparrow is a real treat to watch every time (whose character traits and personality-type was inspired by a close friend of his, Keith Richards according to a 2006 Rolling Stone article (when DEAD MAN'S CHEST came out).  Keira Knightley's breakout role as the governor's independent and forward-thinking daughter Elizabeth Swann is here, and so is Orlando Bloom is fine Erroll Flynn-esque form (and in 2003, the first time we saw him as someone other than Legolas) as the blacksmith-turned-pirate Will Turner (as we all know, his character and family history play a big part in BLACK PEARL's story).  The rest of the cast does just fine, but what really anchors PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN is its engaging and unexpected story along with entertaining, high-seas action.  \r\n  \r\nHaving seen this movie three times (many people have definitely seen it more), this movie improves with each viewing after 9 years.  The sequels were more special effects-heavy and more cluttered with unnecessary story threads, yet the first PIRATES is undoubtedly the best.  Plus with seeing Industrial Light and Magic's pioneering special effects work on the skeleton pirates blew my mind way back when.  \r\n\r\nIn the most favorable sense, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL is an enduring, modern-edged nautical swashbuckler and an excellent summer blockbuster packed with fine acting and a unforgettable Johnny Depp performance; incredible high-seas action sequences, a rousing Hans Zimmer score, and an inventive story that brings a modern edge to the traditional settings of British-controlled Port Royal and the surrounding Caribbean.",

            "content": "Pirates of the Caribbean: The curse of the black Pearl (2003) is such a great film. It was directed by Gore Verbinski in the genre of adventure and action. The role of the main character, Captain Jack Sparrow, is played by Johnny Depp. His character is an eccentric and selfish pirate such as Captain Barbossa, who is played by Geoffrey Rush. The cast also includes Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann.\nWhen Elizabeth is kidnapped by a group of pirates led by Barbossa and taken aboard their ship, The Black Pearl, Will Turner, the young man who loves Elizabeth sets out to rescue her. But he can't do it alone, so he enlists the help of Jack Sparrow. Together they go after Elizabeth and of the Black Pearl, but they soon discover that the captain and his crew are cursed to remain between the living and the dead, they look like skeletons at the moonlight. Believing in the fact that the curse can be broken by Elizabeth\u00e2(TM)s blood they go to Isla de Muerta to put back the last coin, with her blood, of the cursed treasure, back into the chest. However she's not the daughter of Bootstrap, Will is. \nIt was only possible with extraordinary special effects and an unforgettable soundtrack. You will always hear about Johnny Depp and his incredible performance and about the day they almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. This is a very fast - moving and gripping film, it's definitely not predictable and it's over all a memorable plot.\nI could watch it many times and never get sick of it. I hope that its sequel be as good as this one. That\u00e2(TM)s my tip to you: watch Pirates of the Caribbean, you won\u00e2(TM)t be disappointed.",

Lots of funny action scenes with brilliant ideas, well done stunts and good special effects.\r\n Johnny Depp does a great job as captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate with a very weird mime, who is a good person, but not always on the right side of the law. I also like Keira Knightley as Elisabeth Swann, an upper class yet strong woman. Orlando Bloom is pretty average as Will Turner, he isn't a very good actor, but he is tolerable in this one, because his character is very interesting. Geoffrey Rush is great as Barbossa, the captain of the Black Pearl, a brilliant villain.\r\nMost of the minor characters are pretty good as well, but a few of them are a little forgettable.\r\n\r\nI like the story, it fits the time and pirate legend pretty good, it is a great adventure. The dialogue is also well written, lots of funny moments. I would have liked a little more character development and a little less action, but I was very entertained.\r\n\r\nThis movie is way better than the awful sequels, where the characters were used wrong and their motivations were not always clear, also the plot in this one is way better than in the sequels.\r\n\r\n8/10",

It's mostly predictable, it's got some good gags, but it's heavily flawed.\r\n\r\nThe film has literally HUNDREDS of contradictions and plot holes.  I enjoyed the film, but the contradicitions were distracting.\r\n\r\nThis film has a fantastic first half hour.  It's funny, and thrilling at times.  However, after that first half hour, the quality drops.  It's still enjoyable, and you will be entertained, but it never lives up to that first half hour.\r\n\r\nThe musical score is VERY good.  There were too many hands in the score for me to properly credit anyone, but Hanz Zimmer played a big part in the score, and it shows.\r\n\r\nThe action, is mostly generic, and will never have you on the edge of your seat.  At times, the action is even predictable.  At the minimum, it's passable, and not terrible.\r\n\r\nThe acting is strong.  Performances from Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Geofferey Rush shine.\r\n\r\nThe story is a little on the cliche side, but it's a silly tale, and no one really cares.\r\n\r\nIn addition to contradictions, there were a lot of moments where I rolled my eyes at the improbability of it all.  Of course, teenage boys tend to eat that stuff up.\r\n\r\nPOTC: TCOTBP is a fun, albeit flawed movie, that's probably best for teens and tweens with low expectations.",

The film is well cast and launched the careers of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom.  It also propelled Johnny Depp to superstardom, as his inspired performance as the eccentric and charismatic Captain Jack Sparrow turned the character into a pop-culture icon.  The CGI effects work for the most part, and the score's outstanding.  Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a wildly entertaining and fun high-seas adventure.  Savvy?",

I personally loved the way Pirates of the Carribean wasn't a stereotypical pirate film, but was a historical fiction film with a twist of fantasy.  I also liked how Jack Sparrow would seem like one of the worst pirates they had ever encountered, then escapes against the odds.

This was definitely some of his best work and he rewrote the book on how to play the rogue and how to play the hero in family films. I have never been a huge fan of Orlando Bloom but even he did well as the young Will Turner. The directing by Gore Verbinski was excellent and I sometimes wish this film never had sequels. If this film never had sequels, it might have gone down as one of the best in the 2000s. Still, a film definitely worth seeing over and over again.",

He makes this character so charming and likable, and the film wouldn't have been as fun as it was if he had played it straight. The action in the final act is a lot of fun, and Hans Zimmer's iconic theme song totally enhances the experience. I do have some major issues with the film, and one of them being the first 35 minutes. Everything that happens in here have absolutely nothing to do with the main story, and I just thought it could've been a lot shorter. Also, there are some events that make no sense in terms of plot, and I was slightly bored when that was happening. But overall, I have to admit I had a good time watching the film.

It's really enjoyable start to finish and I don't think this gets anything wrong as a Disney film. So to me it is my favorite Disney movie of all time!

Rush is also good in his role, as is under-appreciated character actor Kevin McNally. So while Pirates is a good action romp, it is not what I would call a great movie.",
