You get to see great performances all around from Slater, Walken, Oldman, Hopper and Pitt. Plus a young James Gandolfini, playing a Tony Soprano type character. And Bronson Pinchot as a Hollywood Sleazeball coke dealer. This is probably near Pulp Fiction for me. The dialogue and action are great, and even though it's quite long, it flies by. 9/10",

Few films can claim to have had so great an influence on television history. \n\nI was worried when Patricia Arquette started falling over Christian Slater as he awkwardly explained kung fu movies and Spiderman comics to her; it seemed that the film was trending towards being a shut-in's fantasy made reality. Fortunately, there was a sigh of relief as Alabama revealed herself to be a hired callgirl. In the rest of True Romance, which Tarantino has described as his \"most autobiographical film\" (which is ironic considering that he didn't direct it), we maintain that fun dynamic out of a whirlwind romance comic book but focus less on plot than we do on detail. It's not bogged down by narrative, instead forming a canvas for the screenwriter to project his own creativity and personal tastes through a stream of movie references, oddball characters, and spats of interesting dialogue. It feels almost improvisational how characters can drop in and out at will, leaning on unusually star-heavy cameo and bit performances from major stars (including a magnetic Gary Oldman and a classic verbal slapdown between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper). \n\nI think the film was likely considered much more creative in its own time, before Tarantino began to get sizable budgets to see his own ideas through with minimal studio interference, but True Romance still has plenty of entertainment value and innovation for its age.

            "content": "Somehow, I've never seen this movie before. Sure, it was featured by other writers on the site before and I've owned it for some time, but somehow I've never found the reason to watch it. Luckily, Arrow Video released several new versions of the film on blu ray and 4K UHD, which gave me the opportunity.\n\nWhat was I waiting for?\n\nTrue Romance was a script Quentin Tarantino sold after Reservoir Dogs and unlike so many of his written work, it was directed by someone else: Tony Scott (ironic, as Tarantino went off on Scott's best-known film Top Gun in the 1994 movie Sleep With Me).\n\nI kind of love that this started with Roger Avery unable to finish a script, so he turned it over to Tarantino, who gave him a stack of pages back which were Natural Born Killers and this movie, which starts after the prison riot and features Mickey and Mallory Knox tracking down the writer who made the cash-in film about their lives. As that writer hides out, he writes True Romance.\n\nTarantino has said that it's his most autobiographical film and by and large, he was happy with the way it turned out. It's pretty faithful to his screenplay, other than changing the story to a linear structure and not the all-over-the-place narrative that Tarantino would use for Pulp Fiction. He also took much of the film's first act from his 1987 effort My Best Friend's Birthday.\n\nI have to say, as a man obsessed with movies that married a short-haired blonde from Detroit, this movie has a lot to say to me.\n\nAs Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) sits alone in a theater watching a Sonny Chiba triple feature, Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette) — named from Pam Grier's character in The Big Bird Cage — spills her popcorn all over him, leading to an evening where the two bond over cinema, Elvis, diner food and sex.\n\nThe next day, she tells him that she was hired to give him a good time by his boss. He doesn't care; they're both in love. They get married and moments later, Elvis (Val Kilmer) himself appears to Clarence and tells him that he has to set Alabama free from her pimp Drexl (Gary Oldman, perfect for the too brief time he's on screen). All Clarence wants is her to be free, Drexl attempts to kill him, but misjudges just how strong Alabama's love makes the young man. Running into the night with two dead bodies left behind, the young couple learns that they have a briefcase packed with cocaine.\n\nAs we follow the couple to Hollywood, where Dick Ritchie (Michael Rappaport) and Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot) broker a deal with movie producer Lee Donowitz (Elliot Blitzer; this character produced Bounty Law in Once Upon a Time…In Hollywood, is the son of Donny Donowitz from Inglorious Bastards; the movie that he produced that Clarence speaks so highly of, Coming Home In a Body Bag stars Rick Dalton, who is the hero of Once Upon a Time…In Hollywood; he's also pretty much Joel Silver).\n\nThis drug deal is complicated by the fact that Drexl had stolen the cocaine from Blue Lou Boyle, which sends Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) and an army of killers on the trail of Clarence and Alabama. Meanwhile, a cocaine and oral sex aided and abetted arrest leads to the cops wiring Elliot for the big drug deal, an event that leads to a Mexican standoff between our happy couple, the Hollywood elite, organized crime and the police, led by detectives Nicky Dimes (Chris Penn) and Cody Nicholson (Tom Sizemore).\n\nThere's so much that happens in this movie and so much to discuss, but I think it's perhaps best experienced by the viewer. That said, there's an astounding scene between Clarence's father (Dennis Hopper) and Coccotti, as well as Alabama remaining resilient in the face and fists of a hired killer (James Gandolfini). Oh — and Brad Pitt pretty much inventing the movie Pineapple Express with his scene with the mob interrogating him.\n\nThe original ending had Clarence dying and the widowed Alabama eventually turning to crime. Evidence of that is in Reservoir Dogs and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) talking about working with Alabama.",

The juxtaposition of the recurring, light-hearted song and bright, Southern California colors (after the plot leaves Detroit) with the noir themes of drugs, prostitutes, pimps, and Mafiosos, gives the film an enjoyable, indulgent style. But it doesn't stop there. We have visions of Elvis (Val Kilmer), brutal dialogue concerning the genetic makeup of Sicilians, and ASMR of guns being loaded. The shootout is great. You root for Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The cast is absolutely stocked: Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, Dennis Hopper. Oldman as white, dreadlocked-pimp, Drexl Spivey, deserved more screen-time, but that's pretty much always the complaint about Oldman — we just don't get enough of him. True Romance is a solid movie, if not over-the-top pretty much from the jump. Maybe it was too saturated with stars (at least from a 2021 lens), which created a sensory overload. That being said, this is one of those genre bedrock movies, which you need. You can't have synthesized subgenres without the staples of the genre, and True Romance is a staple of all that shit we love about places like Detroit and Los Angeles, pink Cadillacs included.",

This script, filled with precise and unusual dialogue, was written by Quentin Tarantino before the release of Reservoir Dogs.   This is part of the strength of this one.   Unlike Quentin's feeling about his script for Natural Born Killers, which he blamed Oliver Stone for ruining, Tarantino liked the late Tony Scott's version of his script.  The visuals are all Scott.   They lack the thoughtful pace and pauses of a Tarantino directed film; that doesn't mean it isn't good-just not Tarantino.    It is fast paced.   It is violent.   The strength of it is also its actors.  Slater is at his best.  Arquette is lovable.   Oldman's politically incorrect and crazy performance is one for the books.   Dennis Hopper is Dennis Hopper, and that is never bad.    Add a young Michael Rappaport and Brad Pitt. James Gandolfini too.   Blink and you'll miss a younger Samuel L. Jackson.  Christopher Walken is at the top of his game. Look out for Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as a pair of cops.  This film is a winner and holds up more than 20 years later.    The Sonny Chiba, the Elvis, the music love that the script is saturated with are all more enjoyable when you learn Tarantino is the author.",

True Romance is a personal favourite of mine, and even though the ending might not be to Tarantino's liking, in this instance, it's not up to him. Sorry Quentin.

The actors are brilliant and the movie is exhilarating, but with no purpose or message or redeeming value.  Why does Tarantino keep making the same movie over and over?  He writes exaggerated action scenes that are strung together with tender moments, all of them larger-than-life.  His scripts are pure gold for actors who get to chew up the scenery, but is there any social value or message in any Quentin Tarantino movie?  I haven't seen one yet.",

            "content": "\"You're so cool.\" \n\nTony Scott directs his crime thriller True Romance (1993) with a stylish flair for the dramatic. Scott brings moody lighting, sleek pans, clever edits, and killer action for True Romance's unique appeal. He uses neat slow motion for the action shootouts for emphasis on a character's position to a gun or weapon as opposed to using slow motion for a cool visual choice. I think True Romance may very well be Scott's best film as it's a beautiful romance story, engaging crime drama, and a funny comedy of errors.\n\nQuentin Tarantino's script is complex, placing numerous characters against each other in each scene. He takes a vast flux of characters moving around Detroit and L.A. all to place them in the same room for the finale. His dialogue is all his own for better or worse. His characters will feel like their own people, but never real. His references are too obscure to Tarantino's own tastes to come across as regular people. I still despise how he adores making white characters use the \"n-word\" at will. It feels cheap regardless of context. Thankfully, Tarantino's plot is engaging and intriguing as you never know where the story is heading until the last scene.\n\nChristian Slater is great as a careless hero named Clarence. Patricia Arquette is dreamy as a nervous prostitute turned love interest on the run. True Romance takes clear influence from Bonnie & Clyde, Badlands, Wild at Heart, with Thelma & Louise. Hans Zimmer references Badlands' score for True Romance's theme. It's a flashy film of colorful characters and visceral bloody action. The gunfire will keep you awake at the very least.\n\nDennis Hopper is wonderful as Slater's panicked and concerned father. He gets a brilliant tough guy monologue to go out against the devious and threatening Christopher Walken. Val Kilmer gets two scenes as Slater's imaginary mentor Elvis. His accent and vocal tone sounds identical to Elvis. Gary Oldman transforms into a greasy and sleazy pimp that is unrecognizable. His threatening sequence to Slater in the lamplight is genius acting. James Gandolfini similarly gets a fearsome, violent sequence with Arquette that demonstrates his poignant dramatic acting. Brad Pitt is hilarious as the stoner Floyd, who just rips bongs and gives directions the whole movie.\n\nEven Chris Penn and Michael Rapaport get memorable supporting roles alongside the aforementioned greats. True Romance is just a collection of brilliant character actor performances surrounded by gritty violence.",

The director Tony Scott fails to comprehend Tarantino's script and as a result this love bash feels effortful and messy. But I wouldn't just blame Scott to make sense in a film so teenage-ish as such. Not that we haven't had good films in such genre, it's just that the goofiness isn't motivated as those films do and are. And Tarantino is to be put on trial too. Maybe, if he was there, in the director's seat, he might have carved it out in one rhythmic beat. Even though the script and the characters journey might constraint it. The best thing film does is not feeling obligated to explain the falling in love aspect of these characters.\n\nIt is instant. Either it happens or not and when it does, that is it. There's no clause, no explanation and no boundary. Now, in a film that is basically a chase scene, it is extremely bold and outrageous for Scott to expect us to have a conversation. That liberty comes only when the rush is dragged and not pushed by the film. To a script that zooms its way out, Scott had to focus not only on the stops, the stillness of the storyline but also on the emergencies.\n\nOn performance objective, the cast is a topsy-turvy dream. Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, James Gandolfini, Brad Pitt and Christopher Walken are supporting the lead in the form of guest appearances. But what still works, is those same little delights of chocolates that we receive periodically in the film fooling us in believing that it is in safe hands. True Romance is another product that came out from Tarantino's press that communicates with young couple with a robust argument and his signature ruffian violence.",

True Romance has it's Quentin Tarantino style to the story and the directing style is by Tony Scott even it had some violence that are intense are really enjoyable. It had a huge cast in this. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are Clarence Worley and Alabama Whitman, the two couple who are married after going to the movies to watch a kung fu film. Dennis Hopper plays Clarence's father. Val Kilmer plays an Elvis Presley apparition who is a conscience to Clarence like he is on his mind because Clarence an Elvis Presley fanatic. And then we have Gary Oldman as the pimp, Drexl, who Alabama used to work with. Even if I've heard of this movie cause' I'm a fan of old stuff, the realistic violence is got to be the highlight of the film. I just love s**t like that. As it is, the film is a cult favourite for the people and it kind of reminds them of the film made by Quentin Tarantino because of the stylish look of violence. What more can I say?

It starts out in savage Detroit, a post-industrial wasteland where Sonny Chiba movies and comic books pass for culture and art. Clarence falls in love with Alabama, a whore with a heart of gold, and, in killing her pimp, he finds himself in possession of a suitcase of cocaine. While gangsters chase them, they race to Hollywood to find a buyer for the drugs amidst wealthy film producers. Quentin Tarantino wrote the screenplay and it includes many of his obsessions like kung fu movies, pulp paperback criminals, and brilliant dialogue. The Detroit setting is purely literary, an homage to one of Tarantino's biggest influences, Elmore Leonard, who set many of his crime novels there including The Switch, a copy of which a young Tarantino was once apprehended stealing from a Kmart. When the film moves to Los Angeles the setting is equally vividly portrayed with a cast of stoners and wannabe actors and rich film producers. There's a tremendous amount of acting talent from Patricia Arquette to Samuel L. Jackson, Dennis Hopper to Christopher Walken. But ultimately it's the romanticism of the two lovers on the run that make this such a great film, particularly as expressed through the eloquent voice over of the young woman, Alabama.",

In der eigenen Glorie. Unschwer zu erkennen, entspringt dieses Universum aus den tiefsten Wünschen eines Heranwachsenden (und zwar eines männlichen). True Romance sind die feuchten Träume eines Teenagers, der Martial Arts Filme liebt, Waffen und Mädchen mit dicken Dingern. Schlecht ist der Film deshalb nicht, es braucht nur den richtigen Zugang. True Romance öffnet einfach ganz viele Schubladen voller Klischees und sortiert. Das aber mit solcher Energie, soviel Spass und derartig bekloppten Einlagen, dass ich mich nur schwer dagegen wehren konnte! Einfach das Gehirn am Einlass abgeben. Der Held Clarence (Christian slater) ist die Identifikationsfigur. Er arbeitet im Comic Laden und verbringt seine Freizeit damit, Kung Fu Filme zu glotzen. Schwer fassbar für ihn, als eine Blondine (mit einem archetypischen 90s Haarschnitt) in sein Leben dringt. Sie heisst auch noch Alabama (lechz!) und wird gespielt von Patricia Arquette. Muss man noch erwähnen, dass sie eine Hure ist? Ich denke, es ist der einzige mögliche Beruf für eine Bombe wie sie in einem Film wie True Romance! Ihr Job bedeutet übersetzt: Viel Freizeit, keine Eltern, immer erreichbar, zumindest ab einem gewissen Preis. Natürlich kosten solche Damen wie Alabama nie etwas für den Helden in Filmen wie True Romance. Beide zusammen ergeben ein Comic Paar, das in Bonbon Farben strahlt! Alabama ist übrigens die Unschuld in Person. Erst seit vier Tagen arbeitet sie als Nutte, doch hat bereits einen grausamen Zuhälter hinter sich (Gary Oldman). Mit ihm wird sich Clarence auseinandersetzen müssen... Clarence ist beides: Mutig und dumm und so kommt das Paar in den Besitz von fünf Millionen Dollar, die der Mafia gehören. Verfolgt vom Mob gehts über Land Richtung Rio. Inszeniert hat Routinier Tony Scott den Film. Der wahre Autor, dessen Handschrift jede Dialogzeile auszeichnet, ist aber Quentin Tarantino, der gerade in Sundance seinen ersten eigenen Film vorgestellt hatte. Tarantino kreiert diese Welt aus harten Typen, leichten Mädels und schmierigem Melodram. Dazu gibts Waffen, Drogen und ganz viele Intrigen. Wie in den frühen Tarantino Filmen so üblich, gipfelt der Plot darin, dass sich sämtliche Parteien bewaffnet gegenüber stehen und losballern. Es gibt keinen einzigen Moment des Innehaltens, geschweige denn tieferer Gedanken. Hier ist alles Style und Action! Viel mehr noch als die Rahmenhandlung machen einzelne Szene Spass. Das liegt am ungeheuren Cast: Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper und Brad Pitt haben unvergessliche Auftritte. Val Kilmer schliesslich spielt Elvis, der ein guter Ratgeber in allen Lebenslagen ist. Falls du dich nicht darüber wunderst, dass sogar der Geist von Elvis mitmacht, bist du hier ganz sicher im richtigen Film!",

            "content": "4.5/5.  Revisiting \"True Romance\" is always a lot of fun, and the fan-edited \"Tarantino Cut\" - which sees Tarantino's structure for the film meticulously restored - is a really intriguing way to re-examine this film.  Tony Scott, by Tarantino's own assessment, did a fine job of filming pretty much everything Tarantino wrote in his screenplay, but structured the story in a more conventional manner than he would have preferred.  The re-edit works because there are now more builds and revelations throughout the narrative.  With the exception of a few additional Christopher Walken scenes - which are really superfluous and diminish the impact of his iconic scene with Dennis Hopper - this fan-made cut is really worth watching.  The alternate ending (which was available as a DVD extra on the original cut) makes for interesting consideration and is arguably more realistic, but not necessarily as satisfying as that of the theatrically released version.\n\nTarantino was at the top of his game when he wrote this film, creating numerous memorable characters and scenes - at the top of the list of which remains the now classic interrogation scene between Walken's haughty gang boss and Hopper's protective cop-father.  Gary Oldman is completely astounding as the would-be black pimp / drug boss Drexl.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are utterly charming.  James Gandolfini's career was effectively started by his wonderful performance in his single scene as a hired hitman.    \n\n\"True Romance\" is *almost* too violent, but straddles those fine lines between gratuitousness, glorification and impactful serving of the narrative with a deft and stylish hand.  It is a uniquely grim, comic, violent and sweet film, replete with great characters played by perfectly cast actors and an undulating pace which gradually builds to a wonderfully chaotic climax.  Whichever version you watch, \"True Romance\" remains one of the great modern black comedies of hollywood, its explosive excesses handled adeptly by Tony Scott, who with Quentin Tarantino's singularly sharp screenplay ,created a classic film of the 1990's.",

            "content": "Knowing this film was written by Tarantino, it was a no-brainer that it would be violent and rich in dialogue. It also seemed like a strange title since Tarantino has never directed a romance story, and this movie is only devoted to the titular romance at certain moments. Rather than focusing on the actual romance, this film primarily focuses on the aftermath of Clarence's decision to \"rescue\" Alabama from her pimp. What I mean by this is that the movie is driven by the fact that people are after Clarence once he steals some cocaine as well as by Clarence's sense of freedom by sitting on a fortune as long as he sells the coke. The romance is something that compliments this story.\n\nWhen the romance is actually given attention in the film it proves to be interesting. Clarence learns that Alabama is a prostitute who his boss had hired to show Clarence a good time on his birthday, and this makes no difference to his feelings for Alabama. She is touched that he genuinely had a good time with her - the greatest time he has had with a girl in his whole life. Sex is not the deciding factor here; Clarence loves Alabama for who she is, what she loves, her comforting presence. Perhaps this is the meaning of the title - the romance is formed regardless of the situation of how the two met. The two are together throughout the movie, but it is a shame that most of the film focuses on the crime Clarence becomes involved in rather than the dynamics of this relationship.\n\nThis movie is made up of a stellar cast, and it is a shame that a good amount of recognizable names are only in the film very briefly. Though Tarantino only wrote this film we see a lot of faces found in films which he directed: Brad Pitt, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, and Chris Penn. Christian Slater as Clarence is a perfect fit for the role though he is not a well-known actor. He adds great personality to Clarence who is a true Tarantino character, defined by his taste in pop culture, as well as just a touch of craziness to make his desperation believable.\n\nPerhaps it is because this film is directed by Tony Scott and not Tarantino, but True Romance is a decent story which lacks Tarantino-level energy, especially in its action sequences. True Romance is a fun experience if you keep in mind it is a screenplay by Tarantino in his early days.\n\n3.0/4.0",

They go to a diner and flirt with each other. At Clarence's apartment they have sex. She confesses that she is a call girl hired by Clarence's boss as his birthday present. Each claims to have fallen in love and they marry and express their commitment with one another by getting tattoos. An apparition of Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) tells Clarence that killing her pimp will make the world a better place. Clarence visits Alabama's pimp, Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman), who makes Clarence uneasy. Clarence tells Drexl that he has married Alabama and she has no additional business with him. Drexl and Clarence fight, Clarence draws a gun and kills Drexl. He grabs a bag that he assumes contains Alabama's belongings (which in fact contains drugs that Drexl's peddling). Later Clarence and Alabama go to see Clarence's estranged father, Clifford Worley (Dennis Hopper), a former cop. Clifford tells Clarence that the police assume Drexl's murder is a drug-related killing, and that the cocaine belonged to Irish mob boss \"Blue Lou\" Boyle. In Los Angeles, the young couple plan to meet Clarence's old friend, Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport), an aspiring actor. Back in Detroit, Clifford is confronted in his home by Don Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken), Boyle's consul in the Detroit Mafia, who wants the drugs taken from Drexl. Clifford refuses to reveal where his son has gone. Coccotti shoots Clifford in the head and then finds a note on the fridge giving Clarence's address in L.A...\n\nTony Scott´s (RIP) \"True Romance\" with a script filled with pop culture references from Quentin Tarantino is a violent ride with larger than life characters and with a hint of Bonnie and Clyde in Clarence and Alabama. When re-seeing it today it´s so very stylistically and aesthetically in the line of what became Tony Scott´s slightly over the top trademark of filmmaking. It´s a gritty, dynamic, bloody and amoral road movie with a large ensemble cast. It´s shameless in its exploitation of excessive violence and personally I wasn´t all that impressed when I re-saw it the other day. The fight between Alabama and Virgil is just too much to be honest. Despite the fact that we get solid performances from everyone involved (who will forget Gary Oldman´s Drexl) the storyline isn´t all that exciting nor logic in many ways and I reckon the film would´ve been far better off with the alternative ending as that would´ve fit the film much more. I reckon time has made me feel different about this sort of films and I have grown a tiredness of Tarantino´s ultra violence over time. At least when the story isn´t engaging and just seem to exploit violence. Compared to for example \"Inglourious Basterds\" which I still reckon as one of Tarantino´s best.",

            "content": "It's hard to watch \"True Romance\", based on an early Tarantino script, and not compare it slightly unfavorably with the films he would personally go on to direct from his own scripts, but really, Tony Scott did a pretty great job with the script, and while it's no \"Pulp Fiction\", \"True Romance\" is an electric action-comedy-drama, full of cracking performances and Tarantino's signature pop-culture-laden dialogue and ridiculous - and ridiculous bloody - action sequences. \n\nWhat a cast this film has, though! There are so many intricacies to all the great performances, but it's better to just list them with a basic description, because there are so many awesome actors on show here that I couldn't possibly talk about all of them in a concise manner. In the center we have Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as a comic book store cashier Clarence and the call girl, Alabama, he marries, respectively, who find themselves on the run after he kills her ex-pimp (Gary Oldman) out of pure spite (well, it was kinda self-defense). The murder isn't really the reason they have to go on the run; Clarence accidentally grabbed a bag full of uncut cocaine when he meant to grab Alabama's belongings, and now the drug lord, Vincenzo, played by Christopher Walken, wants his coke back. First he tortures Clarence's dad (Dennis Hopper, in my personal favorite performance in the film), and then he sends a goon, Virgil, played by James Gandolfini, to Los Angeles to find them. \n\nBut the cast doesn't stop there; we're not even half-way yet. Also important are Dick (Michael Rapaport), an actor friend of Clarence's, and Elliot Blitzer (Bronson Pinchot), a friend of Dick's who agrees to help Clarence sell the coke to big-time producer Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek). Then there's Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore as two cops who attempt to catch Donowitz making the drug deal, and Val Kilmer as the ghost of Elvis Presley, a phantom that hangs over Clarence's shoulder in certain scenes to provide advice. To top it all off, there are some great minor roles played by Samuel L. Jackson, only really in a cameo here as a friend of Alabama's pimp, Brad Pitt, who plays Dick's stoner roommate, and Eric Allan Kramer - the goddamn dad from \"Good Luck Charlie\" - as one of Donowitz' bodyguards. Seriously, that guy has not aged in 20 years. And I include his balding hairstyle in that. \n\nThat astounding cast - and I'm only scratching the surface as there are tons of other great one- or two-line characters who steal their scenes - is the main reason to watch \"True Romance\", though anyone who's a fan of Tarantino's dialogue-and-death style will have a whale of a time here as always. The editing and cinematography aren't quite as hyper-stylized as in Tarantino's own films, but Tony Scott did a solid job of turning yet another masterful QT script into an excellent movie. \n\n\"True Romance\" is a brutal, witty, and ridiculous thriller, with quite a few elements that I found to be totally stupid. Fortunately, that's kind of the point. Why should the characters we're rooting for be logical, when we're rooting for murders and other kinds of criminals in the first place? It's for our benefit as the audience that they make stupid decisions (yes, half of this bollocks could've been avoided had the characters made better choices, and I'm not just talking about NOT murdering or stealing, but they way they react to those situations),  because those stupid decisions lead them into even stupider action sequences, which are yet more excuses to see some of the best actors of our day have a blast beating and shooting each other up in the bloodiest fashion possible. It's a phenomenal experience.",

If it were a person, it would proudly state that it lives in the United States of America and, chances are, it would probably be a hormonal 15-year old boy.  This might suggest that it is a shallow film, but as it is Quentin Tarantino's first major screenwriting job, the shallow attributes are lovably shallow rather than stupefying.\n\tTarantino's mind, I assume, resembles a glorified exploitation movie theater, bursting at the seams with Kung-Fu triple features and Spaghetti Westerns, rockabilly music drifting in the background of the foyer.  \"True Romance\" is a chase movie on crack, exploitative in its violence but charmingly energetic in its dialogue and its acting; it's unbalanced, sometimes off-putting and sometimes gloriously enjoyable.\n\tThe true romance on display rests on the shoulders of Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) and Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), who marry after a whirlwind night surrounded by movies and bedsheets.  Clarence is a comic-book nerd, a friendless average Joe who celebrates his birthday every year by watching a series of Sonny Chiba vehicles; Alabama, in serious contrast, is a prostitute, or, as she puts it, a call girl for the last three days.  They're a mismatch made in heaven, he with his skinny, badly-postured mannerisms and she with her red lipstick, beach-blonde hair, and seedy fur coats.\n\tThough he's euphoric knowing that he's finally found Mrs. Right, Clarence simply cannot ease into domestic bliss knowing that Alabama's pimp (Gary Oldman) is still sneaking around, possibly looking for her.  So, after a long-winded and seriously violent confrontation, he kills him, steals his suitcase of cocaine, and hits the road, his wife in tow.  \n\t\"True Romance\" is directed by Tony Scott and stars Christian Slater, and those are the most prominent obstacles the film encounters in its explosive 120 minutes.  When directing, Tarantino generally makes his violence comically bloody, silly even; Scott, on the other hand, doesn't have the same tongue-in-cheek attitude his writer does in terms of bloodletting, not always lining up with Tarantino's cavorting screenplay.  The sequence in which Alabama is ruthlessly beat up by one of her dead pimp's associates is so disturbingly brutal that it mismatches the splintery, witty writing of the earlier scenes.  Slater, while decent enough to be a distraction instead of a film destroyer, is miscast.  His acting is too calculated, too cautious.  In a film so unhinged, the lead must be just as unhinged; thank goodness for Arquette, Gary Oldman, and Christopher Walken, who are all tremendous, and, yes, unhinged.\n\tThat's what makes \"True Romance\" so frustrating.  60% worth consists of absolutely brilliantly realized conversations, traveling with the ease of a continuous meet-cute; but the other 40% is composed of heinous violence that doesn't quite match the lurid wink of the remaining 60%.\n\tThe violence is almost forgivable, but when you find yourself with a clearer image of Dennis Hopper getting his hand sliced open by one of Walken's henchman than Clarence and Alabama's initial meeting, it's much too difficult.  But when \"True Romance\" is good, it's truly exceptional; there is a reason why so many consider it to be a classic of '90s cinema.  Some might praise it for its climactic shoot-em-up, some might root for Clarence and Alabama's unconventional romance, and some might get a kick out of its dialogue.  There's something for everybody, but one out of those three people will have a hard time consuming it all with no questions asked.",

            "content": "There are 2 simple reasons that I didn't connect with True Romance and I have no interest in watching it again. The first of which is the lack of any likable characters. Even the \"protagonists\" of the film are kind of despicable, and so I am not invested in seeing them succeed. And what am I supposed to be rooting for them to do? Successfully murder a ton of people and sell a boatload of cocaine? I can deal with anti-heroes just fine, but there really isn't anything heroic about these people. They're just slightly less evil than the other drug dealers, hit-men, and pimps that surround them. I guess because there's a love story to open the film we are expected to see the virtue of the two leads, but it was a manufactured love story between a prostitute and a schizophrenic who speaks to Elvis, so that didn't really click with me.\n\nThe other big shortcoming I found in True Romance is the cast. \"What?!\", you may be thinking, \"This is a star-studded cast!\" You're right, and that's why I didn't give this movie a 1-star rating, because some of these scenes are spectacular thanks to the actors in them, but follow me for a moment: Guess who's a great actor...Samuel L. Jackson. Guess how many scenes he's in...1. Guess who else is a great actor...Gary Oldman. Guess how many scenes he's in...2. Guess who else is a great actor...Christopher Walken. Guess how many scenes he's in...1, so you get the idea. Now guess who are the worst actors in the movie...Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Bronson Pinchot, Michael Rapaport, and basically everyone else who is in 50% or more of the movie. I love so many of the talented actors and they absolutely nail the 1 or 2 scenes they are featured in, but even the finest Filet Mignon is going to be hard to enjoy if you're chasing each bite with a can of SPAM. It makes the film almost painful for me to watch. \"Oh, man, I love this guy! Wait, did he seriously just die?!\" True Romance is a heaping helping of potential that someone just crapped all over. I'd love to watch the handful of amazing scenes again in the future, as long as I can fast forward between them.",

The performances are pitch perfect as well including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette  (who is cute as hell), Gary Oldman (I'd say one of his best roles), Michael Rapaport, Val Kilmer (who is basically Elvis), James Gandolfini (who is at his absolute best here), and Brad Pitt (Who's character is stoned out of his mind throughout the whole film). This is a very fun film that has a fantastic setting, some great comedic moments, and explodes into an orgy of violence at the end (what a spectacular finale). With a Grade A director in Tony Scott (I'd say this is possibly his best film), and one of the best script writers in Hollywood, True Romance delivers the goods and so much more. It's a memorable cinematic romp and one of the best action-adventure-comedies you can see.",

            "content": "Before Tarantino directed Reservoir Dogs, he wrote a little script called True Romance. Tony Scott brings the script to life with comic book-style bravura, and uses a truly eclectic cast of talent as leads and supportive players. Slater plays Clarence Worley, a Travis Bickle-type loner who's pre-occupied with Elvis and Kung Fu movies. One night, a sexy call girl named Alabama (Arquette in her breakthrough performance) falls into his lap and before sunrise, the two are madly in love. Clarence confronts Alabama's pimp (a dread-locked Gary Oldman), which turns ugly. Clarence makes off with a suitcase of Alabama's posessions, only to discover that it instead contains a large amount of cocaine. The two young lovers head off to LA to try and sell the dope, unaware that cops and gangsters are on their trail. This all makes for an inevitable Mexican stand-off in true Tarantino fashion. This film has everything. Slater and Arquette are perfectly cast as the heroes, Oldman is brilliant despite limited screen time, while Walken and Hopper have arguably the films best scene in a one-on-one showdown of acting. A pre-Sopranos Gandolfini shines as a phylisophical sociopath, Brad Pitt has scene-stealing work as a scuzzy dope-fiend, and also look for dependable pro's like Tom Sizemore, Saul Rubinek and an un-seen Val Kilmer, who appears as Elvis' ghost, dispursing advice to Clraence at critical junctures. Overall, this is a treat from beginning to end, and works even better with repeated viewings. About as good as it gets for the capabilities of 90's Hollywood.",

As the title already gives away, the story is about a romance, that escalates into a whole criminal pursuit as the lovers hold a stolen suitcase filled with drugs. A great movie, filled with action and strong even humoristic dialogues. A absolute must-see. With an incredible cast: Christian Slater (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Hard Rain), Patricia Arquette (Ed Wood, Lost Highway), Michael Rapaport (Deep Blue Sea, Prison Break), Dennis Hopper (Rebel without a Cause, Speed), James Gandolfini (The Sopranos, Where the Wild Things Are), Gary Oldman (The Fifth Element, The Dark Knight franchise), Christopher Walken (Pulp Fiction, Seven Psychopaths), Samuel L. Jackson (Star Wars Prequels, Die Hard with a Vengeance), Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs, Rush Hour), Val Kilmer (Willow, Top Gun) and Brad Pitt (Interview with a Vampire, Troy). \n\nWhen watching a kungfu film marathon at the Detroit Movie Theatre, comic book salesman Clarence Worley (Slater) meets the beautiful Alabama Whitman (Arquette). After a night filled with sex, she confesses that she is a call girl but has fallen in love with him. Clarence pays Drexl Spivey (Oldman), her pimp, a visit. When the two of them get into a fight, Drexl is killed. Clarence grabs a bag with what he believes are Alabama's belongings, but when arriving home finds out that it's filled with drugs. The couple makes a run for it and ask help from Clifford Worley (Hopper), Clarences' estranged father who is a former cop. From his trailer, the lover plan to go and meet Dick Ritchie (Rapaport), a friend in Los Angeles, who lives with his roommate Floyd (Pitt) and may be able to find a buyer for the drugs. \n\nBut shortly after Clarence and Alabama left, Clifford gets a visit from Don Vincenzo Coccotti (Walken), who tells that the Detroit Mafia wants their drugs back. A deadly cat-and-mouse game will begin...",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nQuentin Tarantino is most commonly known for reinventing film in general.  His script for Pulp Fiction defied all laws of film and is considered by most to be the greatest script ever written.  However, a year before he released Pulp Fiction, he wrote the script for True Romance, a genre bending wild ride filled with very intriguing performances and some very funny dialogue. \n\nPeople tend to think, oh, this is that one film that was written by Tarantino, but directed by someone else (though that someone is an established director).  What they forget to mention, is that this film is actually better than most, if not all his films.  Yeah, it is pretty violent.  Yeah, it does get cheesy at points, but they all enhance the experience for this film.  It truly makes for an entertaining fest of guns, romance, and just Tarantino.\n\nI am not the biggest fan of Tony Scott, granted he has made some fun films, like Unstoppable.  However, here his direction is actually good!  It's nicely shot in that 90s crime format that I love so much.  And he expertly handles the cheesy love moments well along with the bloody, over the top action scenes along with the humor.  It's his best film to date, and I really felt he had talent.  \n\nThe best moments of the film focus more on Clarence's borderline obsession with Elvis Presley.  These moments can be comical, and trust me, they are so funny.  But these reveal a lot about Clarence himself.  He's a good hearted man, but he's too hotheaded to think straight.  At times, he lets his emotions get the best.  In fact, had he not been so emotional, the events of the film wouldn't happen.  The Elvis Presley moments are some of the best moments in the film....Not to mention Val Kilmer plays it excellently.\n\nThe acting in this film is phenomenal.  Christian Slater, who's been on a huge slump, is fit to play the role of Clarence.  He's got that thing where he can talk slickly and act cool, but when you notice what he's saying, you realize he's a creep.  Yeah, that kinda thing.  Christopher Walken is in the film for a short 10 minutes, but those 10 minutes were the greatest 10 minutes ever....Not to mention he was in the scene with Dennis Hopper.  Two great actors, one great scene.  Brad Pitt comes in as a stoner, but he's more of a side character, but he's very likable and I think Chase Nyland would enjoy his moments.  Samuel L. Jackson has a small cameo as a random gangsta who, quote-on-quote, \"loves to eat pussy.\"  Oh, and there's Gary Oldman, who I did not recognize until afterward.  He plays a wigger that is the root of the problem, and yeah, he's amazing.  If you don't like the film, you must admit, there is some top notch acting going on.  \n\nLots of people think Tarantino's name can help a bandwagon, but they're wrong.  There have been blunders on Tarantino's account that I cannot forget.  However, with True Romance, he hits the nail on the head.  He writes a wonderful script, filled with likable characters and moments of pure awe.  I can see why people would think that this film is just some random love film, with action scenes.  And some people might hate that.  However, since I grew up on romance films, I've had a personal bond to them.  And seeing Tarantino make a parody of them, makes me feel right at home.  I guess I had so much fun with pointing out the romance tropes that Tarantino and Scott were making fun of, that I would feel bad if I didn't give this a 10/10.  It truly deserves it....\n\nAlso, points for the name, which is a play on all the cheesy, sappy romance books/films on the 50s.",

I respect filmmakers like Tarantino and Scott that make a movie like that; a film where there's no conditions or sacrifices the characters have to ultimately make, one where we're happy because they're happy. Once Alabama and Clarence were married, they didn't fight once. Not once. That's the kind of marriage I think we all want to have!",

            "content": "\"If you gave me a million years to ponder, I would never have guessed that true romance and Detroit would ever go together.\"\n\nI would never have guessed that Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino would ever go together, but what a pleasant surprise this romantic crime thriller turned out to be. Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record: all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film. I think I enjoyed this film more watching it for the first time now than if I would have seen it in 1993 considering there are so many familiar faces that I probably wouldn't have recognized back then. Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, and Chris Penn all have small but memorable roles. Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!\n\nClarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him: an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.\n\nEven if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed.",

            "content": "For all intents and purposes, True romance shouldn't work on any level. A call girl, Alabama (Patricia Arquette) falls in love her client. The client, Clarence (Christian Slater) then attacks her pimp, played with glorious zest by Gary Oldman, and accidental steals a suitcase full of drugs. The story then moves to include Clarence's father and ex-police offer Clifford, played surprising straight by the great Dennis Hopper. The drugs then attract the attention of the mob led by Vincenzo (Christopher Walken). With all that going on, we head out west to Hollywood, where the suitcase of drugs brings together a big Hollywood producer, the local police and everybody I already mentioned - all to a single hotel room! And everyone is packing! Oh, and I almost forgot to mention a hilarious turn by Brat Pitt as Floyd as Dick Ritchie's (Michael Rapaport) permanently stoned room-mate. Oh oh, and Val Kilmer (though you never actually see his face) plays a mystical Elvis mentor to Clarence!\n\nThe romance shouldn't feel real. But it does. The story should feel contrived. But it doesn't. It is however, very cool. As Alabama tells Clarence near the end of the film 'You're so cool.' This film is as slick as Elvis in his hey day. It even gyrates at a kingly pace to a superb soundtrack. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make a great Bonnie and Clyde style couple, and they are supported by the best! Every single scene with Brat Pitt is hilarious. James Gandolfini's turn as a mob enforcer/hit-man is superb. Gary Oldman's dread-locked pimp Drexl is both shocking and amazing. It all comes together thanks to Quentin Tarantino's unrestrained story and script, which turns out to be a perfect match for Tony Scott's rock-a-roll style direction.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've enjoyed other movies written by Tarantino you'll probably find this entertaining too. It hops about a bit, and it's very violent at times. The plot is pretty simple and easy to follow too. I would say if you are sold on the opening act, and believe in the romance between Clarence and Alabama. You'll be very happy you watched this film.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe film looks great. Kind-a-has a warm sunset glow to it. If your local theater were screening this certainly try to see this on the big screen. At home a HD viewing is recommended.\n\nBest moment for me: >\n\nThe absolute best scene in the movie for me is the conversation between Vincenzo and Clifford. Clifford knows who he's dealing with, and figures his time is up. Vincenzo has just finished talking about how Sicilians are great liars. So Clifford educates Vincenzo on some Sicilian history. The dialog has some colorful language so I'll let you explore that on your own. But trust me, it's priceless!\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Which doesn't detract from the quality, it all its rather fitting here; it's an adventure that's exhilarating and never relents. There's some touching romance here (obviously) which works because of the writing and the chemistry of the two leads. The film features two extraordinary cameos which set up probably the best scenes in the film.

            "content": "(*** )  True Romance is a Tony Scott film, but is probably best known for being written by Tarantino.  The auteur voice of Tarantino is certainly visible in the writing style, but this film is a bit more quirky than most of his offerings, which is part of why I like it.  I feel that  had Tarantino directed this film, it would have been more blunt and dark, but the direction of Tony Scott seemed to perfectly bring out the witty and light-hearted aspects of the story, making it all the better.  Often times this is due to the off-beat score, which can make the most intense moments seem somehow relatable.  Truth be told, if I met Clarence or any of his friends in real life, I would hate (and probably fear) them with a passion.  The strength of this film is somehow making me sympathize with the emotions of a complete psycopath and his insane lady.  Not to mention making me laugh out loud at times where it normally would have seemed inconceivable to do so.\n\nEssentially this is a Bonnie and Clyde type tale which first makes us love a couple then throws them into the bowels of the crime world.  It almost feels like a Coen brothers style of story-telling, where moronic laymen are thrown in way over their head.  Of course this is done with great monologues and a gleeful disregard for human life.  The stylized violence of a Tarantino film is certainly there, but it is a bit more hurtful than in many of the films he directed.  You really feel the pain and loss rather than just marveling at it.  So if I love the direction so much why didn't I rate it higher than other films of Quentin's?  Simply because it isn't as good of a story.  This one came early in his career and showed up when he was more about making fun interesting movies than making an emotional impact.  The film is certainly an anomaly of character motivation, and provides a very unique take on human relationships.  However, it simply isn't a good enough story, and I don't care about the characters or the outcome enough when the final stuff goes down.  Definitely worth a watch, though maybe more for the brilliant acting and dialogue than the story itself.\n\nBy the way I was kind of let down that the two best performances (Oldman and Walken) are very short on screen time.  Boy are they great when we see them though.",

There are no chapters, there's no multiple story-lines that run parallel to one another and interweave to form a perfect bow in the end...It's pretty straightforward: Guy falls in love with Call Girl, kills her pimp, takes his cocaine, and tries to sell it in Hollywood. But, it's the offbeat, Tarantino humor mixed with great dialogue that make this movie. Slater and Arquette as the leading couple are extremely likable and you hope the whole movie that they would get the fairytale ending they deserved. Other notable performances I liked were seeing Brad Pitt as a stoner and Christoper Walken as a Sicilian henchmen (the scene between him and Clarence's dad is one of my favorites.)",

This is one of the best crime films that I have seen, and the cast itself is one that is sure to delight filmgoers everywhere. Every actor here gives something to the film to make it that much better, and the two leads were great as well. There are some darkly humorous parts here and there to compliment the serious tone of the film, and everything works well enough to keep you engaged from start to finish.  Over the course of his career Tony Scott has made some great films. Forget Top Gun as being his best, it isn't. This is his strongest effort. I feel that he really became a confident director with this movie, and he felt even more comfortable behind his camera. Top Gun was a decent affair, but quite overrated. But True Romance is his masterwork. This is simply put an effectively well directed picture that has a truly unique, crazy plot with a memorable cast of talented actors. Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino have created something great here, and it delivers a truly awesome film going experience that you soon won't forget. If you come across True Romance, definitely give it a view, you won't be disappointed. Tony Scott would direct much more exhilarating films in terms of pulse pounding action, but they would also be fairly hit and miss. But with True Romance, he uses the basics of a simple plot, and it makes for a much more convincing and enjoyable movie.",

That's because, unlike ''Reservoir Dogs'', ''Inglourious Basterds'', ''Pulp Fiction'' and ''Django Unchained'', there is absolutely nothing remarkable about this film. Nothing to tell, for that matter. It is just an insanely dumb and neverending spectacle of idioticness from the moment it starts going unstoppable without telling a story even. \n\nNo character in this movie is memorable. Not even Christopher Walken's ''Vincenzo Cocotti'': a Sicilian mobster who for a brief time chases the inamoured protagonists. Very funny fact, since Walken looks anything but Sicilian. Performances are unremarkable, and most of the actors make no effort to propel the characters because the characters are just very stupid. Hell, even screenwriting in this movie is wrong. Phrases that were supposed to be memorable are just very dumb occurences. Other than the hilarious ''You want me to suck his dick?!'' and ''I'm sorry, we don't have coke. But don't worry, there's a Pepsi machine down the hall!'', screenwriting in this film is way too forgettable. \n\nTarantino seems to have written a story whose main characters shares too much similarities with himself, but goes on adventurism that couldn't be further from real life. It seems as though Tarantino writes something he would like to happen to him, but then it's not even an effort to make it memorable.\n\nIt is understandable people like this so much because the sole fact it has QT attached to it and it portrays rather too much exploitation than it should care for an intelligent and satisfying work. ''True Romance'' for me is just one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and basically two hours of my life I won't get back if it weren't because I intend to study Tarantino's filmography.",

A good script only gives a film a strong skeleton, it is up to the director to flesh it out and give it substance with cinematography, music, lighting, changes to the script, etc. Scott utterly fails at this. Zimmer's music is shallow and poppy, the lighting is too pink and happy, and the movie just feels empty and without substance.

            "content": "This is what a Quentin Tarantino type of love story. When he thinks of romance it's like this film. The film is violent, dark, and romantic at times. Tarantino wrote the screenplay, but he didn't direct it. You can see his style in the screenplay writing when you watch the film, because of all of the violence, brutality, and foul language. It even has the usual all start cast that he usually has in his films. You can see how it was written by Tarantino, but you can tell that he didn't direct it. It doesn't seem like an older film like the stuff that he directed does. The film doesn't have the indie film style that his films like Pulp Fiction have. That is how you see the difference of what the film is like when he only writes it, and doesn't both direct and write it. The film is about a guy named \"Clarence\" who meets this cute girl named \"Alabama\" and falls in love with her in one night. She confesses to him that she was paid by Clarence's boss to go out with him, because he never gets out, and he wanted Clarence to have a fun time on his birthday. She is a prostitute, but she actually fell for him in that one night. Typical cliché that you see in all love stories. Clarence goes and kills her pimp who is portrayed by Gary Oldman. She thinks that was such a romantic thing to do, which I think Tarantino wanted her to have that reaction to make fun of really cheesy romance in older love stories. The type of romance that when you think about it is really awful, and makes you want to spew. But they get married after that. The big conflict is that after he killed the pimp he grabbed what he thought was Alabama's bag, but turned out to be a bag with over 200,000 dollars worth of cocaine. They try to sell it, but the gangsters try to come and get them, because it belongs to them. The film got really crazy and intense in the end, and it was awesome. This was a great movie that was written by Quentin Tarantino, but directed by Tony Scott, that not a lot of people have seen, but they should see if they like Tarantino. I don't really think about Tony Scott directing this film, as you can see by how I don't really talk about him, and I just talk about Tarantino in this film. But Tony Scott did do a great job. Great movie.",

Well a confrontation between Clarence and Drexel turns ugly and soon the lovers are on the run with Drexel's \nassociates in hot pursuit over some stolen drugs. The lovers leave Detroit and head to LA to try and unload the drugs and score some money. Easier said than done..soon hitmen and the LAPD get involved leading to a glorious shoot-out in a ritzy hotel with maximum carnage. This film has one of the most impressive casts you will ever see. In addition to Slater and Arquette, you also have Dennis Hopper as Clarence's dad; Christopher Walker as the main bad guy in pursuit of his employer's drugs; Brad Pitt as a dope head room-mate; Samuel L. Jackson as a drug dealer; James Gandolfini as a brutal hitman; Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as LAPD and Bronson Pinchot as a Hollywood executive.

So I just watched it a couple of nights ago, so here's my review for True Romance.\r\n\r\nPlot: Clarance is a comic book store clerk who meets a woman named Alabama while watching a triple feature in the theaters on his birthday. They seem to hit it off, but after sleeping with each other, Alabama admits that she actually is a call girl who was hired by Clarance's boss as a birthday present to him, but she admits that she actually really is in love with him and he admit that he feels the same for her. So they get married and start to live happily, but then Clarance decides to kill Alabama's pimp, Drexel, who is also a drug dealer so Alabama can be left alone and then steals the coke that Drexel have leaving him and Alabama to plan to go to L.A. to sell it. But they eventually are being chased by a Detroit mafia boss who owns the cocaine that Drexel actually stole.\r\n\r\nMina was totally right. This was a really, really good movie. I mean the story was very well written but it's all the other stuff that really makes this movie interesting. I mean the romance is good...if you like that kind of romance that our modern society likes...which I'm not into, but if you do, you'll probably enjoy it. The action was very well done and was really suspenseful and even really deep at some particular moments. And the casting and acting is awesome. I mean my main issue with this film is that some supporting cast members are not in the film as often as you would love to such as Samuel L. Jackson, and Val Kilmer. But some are there for a decent about of time like Brad Pitt and also Christopher Walken who both did some pretty good jobs. But my favorite performance in the film bar none was Gary Oldman as Drexel. I mean I knew he was a good actor before, but holy cow did he really prove how far he can go into being a completely different person. It was pretty remarkable and I wish I could've seen more for him in particular.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for True Romance. It's a well-written and acted romantic crime film filled with an awesome cast, plenty of romance (or at least romance as far as our modern world goes), action-packed and is all around a very good time and I side with Mina that as far as I know, this is probably the best movie that Tony Scott came up with hands down.",

There are a bunch of supporting roles that take up no more than 10 minutes of screen time that are played by Oscar nominated actors. Most importantly, the one scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Unreal. It was bizarre and interesting to see a film written but not directed by Tarantino. You can totally see his stamp on it with the writing but it was clearly directed by someone more versed in action films in the late Tony Scott. It is entertaining all the way through and the best thing I can say about it is there is nothing else quite like it.",

            "content": "This is what a Quentin Tarantino type of love story.  When he thinks of romance it's like this film.  The film is violent, dark, and romantic at times.  Tarantino wrote the screenplay, but he didn't direct it.  You can see his style in the screenplay writing when you watch the film, because of all of the violence, brutality, and foul language.  It even has the usual all start cast that he usually has in his films.  You can see how it was written by Tarantino, but you can tell that he didn't direct it.  It doesn't seem like an older film like the stuff that he directed does.  The film doesn't have the indie film style that his films like Pulp Fiction have.  That is how you see the difference of what the film is like when he only writes it, and doesn't both direct and write it.  The film is about a guy named \"Clarence\" who meets this cute girl named \"Alabama\" and falls in love with her in one night.  She confesses to him that she was paid by Clarence's boss to go out with him, because he never gets out, and he wanted Clarence to have a fun time on his birthday.  She is a prostitute, but she actually fell for him in that one night.  Typical cliché that you see in all love stories.  Clarence goes and kills her pimp who is portrayed by Gary Oldman.  She thinks that was such a romantic thing to do, which I think Tarantino wanted her to have that reaction to make fun of really cheesy romance in older love stories.  The type of romance that when you think about it is really awful, and makes you want to spew.  But they get married after that.  The big conflict is that after he killed the pimp he grabbed what he thought was Alabama's bag, but turned out to be a bag with over 200,000 dollars worth of cocaine.  They try to sell it, but the gangsters try to come and get them, because it belongs to them.  The film got really crazy and intense in the end, and it was awesome.  This was a great movie that was written by Quentin Tarantino, but directed by Tony Scott, that not a lot of people have seen, but they should see if they like Tarantino.  I don't really think about Tony Scott directing this film, as you can see by how I don't really talk about him, and I just talk about Tarantino in this film.  But Tony Scott did do a great job.

The movie is all about the romance so it's more effective when we see that right off the bat. The movie is flashy, fun, full of action and has a terrific actor in nearly every single role.

            "content": "True Romance is the work of two men, known for making movies (as TBS would say) for guys who like movies, and have one of the pick of the litter in the genre from the early to mid nineties. Quentin Tarantino sold his script to fund Reservoir Dogs, and Tony Scott (Top Gun) got picked up to direct. Some have complained that Tarantino should've directed this film, that it's so much his (which I agree with considering the story of the film was taken from his 1987 experimental film My Best Friend's Birthday, which refers to Clarence in this film going to the Sonny Chiba movies) that his own style as a director would've complimented it. It's a nice thought, though that's not what we as the audience are left with, and so with the final product there is much to admire about the style that Scott uses in the film. He films Tarantino's script (from a Roger Avary script originally) very much like he's shooting a Hollywood movie (as he knows how to with DP Jeffrey Kimball), with all the cut-aways and editing timing that is expected in a conventional crime-drama-thriller, then by hearing the snapping dialog from the script, and the cast performing them, Scott does become an important piece of making True Romance a success.\n\nThe story is a throwback to the old 'lovers on the run' formula, among others- Clarence (Christian Slater in one of his finest) is an employee in a comic book store in Detroit, loves kung-fu movies and big guns and such, who gets set up unwittingly with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love, and Clarence feels confident enough by a certain voice in the back of his head (provided by Val Kilmer) to go and free Alabama for good from her vile pimp and drug dealer Drexl (Gary Oldman in one of the better villain roles of the time). He does, and through a couple of accidents Clarence and Alabama wind up with millions worth in cocaine, and high-tail it to LA to sell it, as the original (mob) owners of the coke follow after, with explosive results.\n\nFor fans of the actors, in particular the supporting cast, True Romance is one of the treats of treats in modern movies, on par with Pulp Fiction's roster of know-ables: Christopher Walken as a gangster (who would've thought?), Brad Pitt as a stoner roommate, Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as cops, a few good lines for Samuel L. Jackson, an early plum for James Gandolfini, and my personal favorite of the lot, Dennis Hopper as Clarence's ex-cop father. Another thing that makes True Romance one of the (dare I say) most accessible of Tarantino's works is that a viewer who might not know this is his work on first viewing (this was me a few years ago, sad to say) will stay tuned through the whole thing if it's on TV just because of the star power; indeed, before Oldman's Detrix is introduced into the film, TR seems to flow like it'll be a romantic drama with light overtones. All I can say is by the end of this film, you will see that good taste can prevail no matter how much bloodshed gets on the screen, or how many obstacles get in the way of love (and Elvis!).",

Significantly though was Christopher Walken not reappearing subsequent to a very well done and memorable scene with Dennis Hopper. Worth a watch but below the classics of Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and other Tarantino related work.",

            "content": "After hearing the sad news of director Tony Scottâ??s passing earlier this week I decided to revisit a film of his that has had a considerable impact on the way that I watch films.\n\nIt was the summer of 2002 and I was on a holiday with my school, we were staying at a rather uninspired campsite in France with a few of other schools. One afternoon I found myself wandering the site aimlessly, with all of the ping-pong tables taken I decided to see what was happening in the rec room. Some boys from another school were watching a film, it had been on for about fifteen minutes but there was sufficient violence to hold my teenage interest. I remember being absolutely amazed by what I saw that afternoon; I didnâ??t know films were made like that. I thought all films were Adam Sandler comedies or bad action flicks. I leaned towards the boy sat next to me and asked him what we had just watched, he said â??True Romanceâ??.\n\nWhat I love about this film is that I still get this same buzz when I watch it, itâ??s a film that I can sling on when I donâ??t really know what to watch and each time I come away from finding something new, interesting and inspiring about it. Back then I enjoyed it for its more sensationalist elements but now I see the fantastically built characters, the alluring romantic elements and the subtle beauty of Detroit under snow. I guess these factors were hidden by teenage bloodlust.\n\nThe films ensemble cast is a cinematic treat; with the likes of Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken all gracing the screen we are captivated as they bring a real presence to some original and powerfully written characters. The films dialogue is snappy and memorable, the scene between Vincenzo Coccotti and Clarenceâ??s father is a great example of this, the lines flow beautifully and have a little bite to them.\n\nThis was my first exposure to Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the film, little did I know back in 2002 that I would spend much of the following years watching his films religiously. True Romance has Tarantino stamped all over it, featuring many of his signatures; the violence, the pop-culture references and the â??Mexican stand-offâ?? in the final scene. Tarantino was at one point attached to direct but decided against this, during my â??Tarantino yearsâ?? I thought this was a shame, now firmly out the other side I realise that this is a bit of a blessing. Tarantino has said that had he directed he would have used his famed fragmented narrative style and changed the ending; though not Tony Scottâ??s biggest fan I am certainly glad that he got the project.\n\nThe film has a unique feel to it; I can only liken it to Terrence Malickâ??s Badlands. I see a lot of similarities between the two; the love story isnâ??t that dissimilar from that of Kit and Holly, Alabamaâ??s narration and Hans Zimmerâ??s fantastic reworking of Carl Orffâ??s Gassenhauer are all striking resemblances.\n\nTony Scott made films like Top Gun and Days of Thunder; fast paced films for entertainment. I guess True Romance is a great example of what a film built for these purposes can achieve by taking these notions and digging a little deeper.",

But at the end of the day, when Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the film and is prone for long continuous shots and off-screen violence, praises Tony Scott for making a better film than Tarantino could have.... You have to agree this was a perfect combination of both directing styles. Tony Scott is almost the exact opposite of Tarantino in regards to style and yet it works in True Romance. It's still a \"Tarantino film\" to movie buffs, but the style makes it unique. Despite the violence which is extremely graphic (particularly when James Gandolfinni beats Patricia Arquette), Scott is able to get far more emotion out of the audience than anything Tarantino did to that point in his career and you feel the \"love story\" that is the movie's core. Ive seen this way too many times, and I still find it underrated. Not my favorite Tony Scott movie.... But it might be his best.",

However, the scene where Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper discuss Sicilian history just may be one of my favourite movie exchanges ever.

I may be a bit bias, because I am a sucker for \"in over their heads\" type scenarios, but this one definitely delivers. It provides the proper amount of conflict without delving into the realm of outrageousness, while still providing a fantastically over the top ending. That may seem like a contradiction, but I don't know, it just works. \nThe one thing that didn't work was the Elvis hallucination that Clarence experienced throughout the movie. It did indicate that he had a bit of madness in him, but in my opinion, not enough. If you're going to include it fine, just go some direction with it. Instead, his visions of Elvis just became a distraction and interrupted flow. Oh, and on a side-note, the music in this movie set a fantastic mood.",

This friend is known for her love of romantic chick flicks, the sappier the better. And we know that for me, well, frankly that's not my style. I tell her I'll consider the film if it crosses my path, but since I've always got a rather large queue of movies I wanna watch, and she is neither a trusted movie advisor nor a boy I'm trying to impress, it just went on the backburner. Every so often, the subject would come up again, but I'd brush her off. Eventually I break her \"dont look it up\" rule and I IMDB it very quickly. I basically just look at the cast and notice Christian Slater and Brad Pitt. Intriguing, but not enough. Some time later, I'm on a certain favorite director's IMDB page and I notice a little something under the writing credits. The next time I see this friend, I run up to her \"Why the \\m/ did you not tell me that Quentin Tarantino wrote True Romance?! That should have been your opening arguement!\" \"You looked it up?! I told you to trust me!!\" Anyways the film went on my Christmas wish list (turned out being my final list, since my Daddy was always the one responsible for it).\n\nWhile yes, I prefer ass kicking over a love story, I rather like Tarantino's idea of romance. The tagline says it all \"Stealing, Cheating, Killing. Who said romance is dead?\" Clarence and Alabama have such a light and fun and carefree relationship. Normally, if I see characters getting married within a week of knowing each other, my logical side kicks in and I think it's a horrible idea. With these two, I'm rooting for them. I love that they just jump into things.\n\nBut it's still a Tarantino flick. You've got thugs and drugs and guns and naughty words. You'll notice it's not 100% true to QT's style. It's got his fingerprints all over it, but there were some rewrites and changes at the hands of director Tony Scott. IMDB tells me that it was originally non-linear and that the ending was different. It's got some ties to his other films. Alabama is mentioned in Reservoir Dogs (it was originally intended that she had a thing with Mr White). And it looks like Inglorious Basterd's Bear Jew Donnie Donowitz has a son on the character list here. \n\nYeah so the title may be a turn off for the target audience of this film. Clearly, cause I fell victim to that. But I do think it's quite fitting.

Well, Tarantino wrote the script, it includes actors Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Chris Penn, Val Kilmer, Christian Slater, and Patricia Arquette, it's directed by action movie director Tony Scott, and the characters involved include cops, pimps, drug lords, mobsters, film producers, and hookers.

Every mention has been made about True Romance, and me, being interested in the set of films Tarantino wrote but didn't direct, I took this one upon me to finish and understand like I did Natural Born Killers. Now mind you, I will be making comparisons between this film and NBK.Natural Born Killers disgusted me the first time I saw it. I couldn't finish it, however, I went back to it and observed and absorbed to discover the meaning behind it all. It made sense and came out as something beautiful to me. TR, I wasn't disgusted, I was just not absorbed as I had been with Natural Born Killers. The interest faded in this film when I was introduced to the characters, whom, I hated. I felt no sympathy for Christian Slater's character, as to me, just seemed like another idiot obsessed with violence. Patricia Arquette, a beauty at the time of the film, annoyed me so much.\n\nNBK was more fleshed out. Your main characters are psychopathic serial killers, yet you have sympathy for them and have the desire for the m to escape or win their situation. \n\nAs I think about it, my real criticism is with the characters. The leads made me want to join Mickey and Mallory and hunt them, a saving grace is the supporting roles of Dennis Hopper,  Christopher Walken and Gary Oldman, in that order. \n\nGive it time, I might come to appreciate this film more, but for now, it gets 2/5 stars for being a shallow film about two people I would like to have killed as did almost every other character that came across them.\n\n\nWeeks later.\n\nThe film has grown on me. Even though the performances of Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater annoy me, I have come to realize the fantastical elements o the film that capture you. As I heard mentioned in another review, this is the male version of Today's Twilight films. The fantasy of running off with a beautiful girl on a get rich quick scheme amidst a cycle of violence. Again, the stand outs of the film are the cameos of Brad Pitt, Dennis Hopper, Chris Walken and Gary Oldman. The soundtrack and leading song of You're So Cool by Hans Zimmer leave something of a happy feeling, as everything fits perfectly. \n\nOriginally I gave this film a 3/5 stars. \n\nNow I give it 4.5/5.",

Still hyperviolent, sometimes plain crazy and set in a somewhat twisted alternate reality it has an actual plot, interesting characters and though over-the-top it's not another Kill Bill.\nThis was before QT tried paying homage to blaxploitation/western/martial arts B-Movies but wrote scripts with genuine stories.\n\nHis style is uncanny though and combined with Tony Scott's directing (I was actually surprised to hear that he has directed this but his experience with action films and his talent for pacing adds considerably to Tarantino's writing) True Romance is an entertaining piece of film.\n\nIt also got a nice ensemble cast with Christopher Walken as delightful to watch as always, a great Gary Oldman in a regrettably small role and young Brad Pitt as a stoner - all led by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, both at the height of their short-lived careers as genuine lead material.\n\nCan't say it has become one of my favourite films and although I can understand what people like in Tarantino's work, I doubt that I'll ever truly love one of his films - True Romance is yet another example affirming this thought.\nHowever, great blend of art house and popcorn cinema.",

            "content": "True Romance sounds exactly like my kind of film from literally every angle because it benefited from the direction of Tony Scott and an early Quentin Tarantino screenplay he had deemed to be his finest.\n\n\nTrue Romance has all the zany feeling of a true Quentin Tarantino atmosphere because it combines a legendary soundtrack with the dramatic elements on screen which leave the audiences perplexed about how to feel. It keeps things from ever falling into a single genre category such as refusing the drama from falling into melodramatic territory. And the atmosphere is constantly changing as is the story.\nThe story in True Romance is completely unpredictable. There is no way to tell what is going to happen next, and since it is a Quentin Tarantino-penned film that is the best way to take it. Thanks to Tony Scott's most tense direction in which he creates an atmosphere which is both intense and comedically energetic while still being constantly energetic and entertaining. The film is kind of like if Natural Born Killers omitted most of its kills and was then made right instead of being a sh*tty drug trip and a terrible sitcom, and it goes into a lot of territory which touches upon themes similar to Bonnie and Clyde as well. True Romance is like a modern version of the story where the crime isn't so much about robbery as it is about drug dealing, and the way that the film romanticizes so many themes in a gleefully gritty and gory fashion just goes to show what true romance is. It stays true to its title, and while at certain points I had a feeling that the quantity of themes jam packed into the film had a little bit of overkill, it never felt like too much to take in and it made for thoroughly entertaining cinema which showed off some of the greatest talents that both Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott have as filmmakers.\nTrue Romance is incredibly well written and benefits from \tQuentin Tarantino's skill for pitching incredibly intelligent dialogue which comes from the actors' mouths so naturally that you wouldn't be able to suspect that it had to be written in the first place. The screenwriting skills that would later win Quentin Tarantino two Academy Awards give savvy fuel for True Romance to run on, and it takes that and runs far thanks to Tony Scott's direction. Tony Scott capitalizes on the passionate and sadistic energy of the story in True Romance which renders it a very well paced romantic crime comedy which is shot very well on some awesome locations and is packed with a theme of true grit, and frankly the role director Tony Scott plays has the exact same skill that only Quentin Tarantino himself could give to the film, so some of Tony Scott's finest directional skill rides True Romance and keeps it intact through all of its theme exploration.\nFrankly, Tony Scott has proven twice to be the best film director to be working with Quentin Tarantino when he made True Romance and later when they worked together on Crimson Tide, and he manages to turn True Romance into an enjoyable and energetic thrill ride which boasts a lot of entertainment and an exceptional cast.\nChristian Slater's lead performance in True Romance is definitely one of his career best. His lead performance in True Romance is the fine line between over the top and excessive in his most intense moments, and at other times it is just naturally charismatic. Christian Slater's lead performance in True Romance makes him perfect for the part because his swift and sharp line delivery is fuelled by his tight edged tenacity, and it gives him an edge to his performance that is really needed to keep the sadistic fun of True Romance alive. Christian Slater is a dead on great cast member in True Romance.\nPatricia Arquette makes a fine lead as well because she has a lot of passionate drama in her line delivery which she delivers without problem, and she has a smile which simply lights up the screen in True Romance. Her chemistry with Christian Slater is also excellent, so the two of them make a really good team in True Romance. Patricia Arquette is in one of her much younger role in True Romance, and her charisma is just terrific.\nChristopher Walken's small time on screen allows him to bring out some of his darkest elements as an actor which completely nails the dramatic aspects of the film. He brings a certain level of sophistication to his role as the Sicilian Vincenzo Coccotti which is sharp and tense, and his scene with Dennis Hopper is excellent because of the powerful chemistry they share.\nDennis Hopper proves time and time again to be a great actor, and in True Romance he delivers a monologue about Sicilians which Quentin Tarantino said to be potentially the greatest thing he had ever written, and it is full of ripe intensity and strength which he as carried for many years as an actor and proves once again as a cast member in True Romance.\nGary Oldman's performance is one of the most oddball of his career. He is unrecognisable in his role of because he looks like a realistic and humane version of the character portrayed by John Travolta in the worst film of his career, Battlefield Earth. But doing something John Travolta could never do, Gary Oldman makes his character nuts and goes overboard without going ridiculous. Within his brief screentime, Gary Oldman establishes that he is flawlessly able to step into the role of an absolute sociopath\nBrad Pitt's young performance shows off some of the charisma which would later get him nominated for several Academy Awards by showing off just what he can do in a small and laid back roll, and the performances of Chris Penn, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini and Val Kilmer added a nice touch to the film.\n\nSo True Romance may be a little much for some viewers, but benefiting from Quentin Tarantino's excellent screenplay and some of Tony Scott's most powerful direction it proves to be sharp and rich entertainment which is intense and funny at the same time.",

The movie takes you on a journey with people that you wouldn't want to normally associate with: lowlifes and murderers. The main characters in this movie, played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, have a strong connection to the criminal couples in other Tarantino movies, such as Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction. The cast is simply amazing and is reminiscent of the star-studded cast of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The comedy is dark and violence pervades throughout most of the film. At first glance, one would think of this movie as almost a romantic comedy. Once you delve deeper into the storyline, you discover that it is much more than that. It comes across as a violent thriller with those small elements of a romantic comedy and portrays itself as classic Tarantino. While this movie was not as groundbreaking as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, it did combine genres in a very Tarantino style: breaking the mold of the traditional romance movie.",

On his birthday Clarence's employer sets him up with a call girl named Alabama (Patricia Arquette), the two instantly hit it off and fall in love. But when Clarence tries to emancipate Alabama from her psychotic pimp Drexel (Gary Oldman), he accidentally runs out with a suitcase full of cocaine thinking it is Alabama's clothes. Now the two are on the run from some very dangerous criminals and have to figure out what to do with all the drugs they stole. \nCristian Slater and Patricia Arquette have great on-screen chemistry and give solid performances. Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken both give chilling performances as the two main antagonists. Altogether great movie with really good character development, and the plot flows very well.",

Fantastic, an A++ in my book.  Gary Oldman is great as a white pimp drug dealer, and Walken and Hopper have a dialogue scene which can never be forgotten once seen.  Slater and Arquette have a romance which is played so well, you believe its carried on off camera.

Oh and here's a little advice to all you single boys out there. If you're suffering with no idea about how to get a girlfriend, see if this kinda boosts your confidence because True Romance is the true romance. The story is about a guy named Clarence who is celebrating his birthday in the cinema he bumps into Alabama and it is love at first sight for them but it turns out that Alabama was set up by her boss Drexi to purposely bump into him. To escape from Drexi, Clarence and Alabama go to California to live with Clarence's friend Mentor and takes away a suitcase thinking it has her clothes in it but instead has five million dollars worth of cocaine. This unfortunately brings a whole group of underworld characters including a mob boss who wants the suitcase back that has his cocaine in it. I gotta tell you, this film has almost everything that a perfect romance story would that even if it's good, it's impossible to give it a good rating because it's been ages for me since I've seen a movie that was waaaaaaaaaaaay to good for me to give the film a 10/10.

            "content": "Guys like Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith burst out of the blocks, garnering massive critical acclaim for their originality and fresh approach to both dialogue and film-making in general. The unfortunate reality for both is that as their careers progressed they both fell in love with their own press and reputations, resulting in a loss of perspective and an inability to differentiate between truly entertaining moments; and self indulgent crap.\r\n\r\nThat's why I strongly believe that for both of the above mentioned allowing other directors to take a crack at their scripts. Hopefully the fresh eye might be more likely to excise irrelevant and plain silly material, while keeping the core elements intact.\r\n\r\nI strongly doubt anyone else might've improved on the final versions of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but since then it's fair to say that Tarantino hasn't made anything rivaling either in terms of quality or longevity. (I'm not sure what anyone else would've made of Dogma, Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back to be honest!)\r\n\r\nWe'll never know what Tarantino might have done if allowed to proceed with his True Romance script, what I can say is that the guy who ended up with it did an extremely good job. Not quite great mind you, but about as good as I think this was destined to be.\r\n\r\nThe tale of young lovers Clarence and Alabama Worley starts with them finding each other in Detroit, shows how they come into a large cache of drugs when Clarence decides to 'emancipate' his (now ex-)hooker wife from her menacing and dangerous pimp, and follows them as they flee cross country to LA to work out how best to turn the illicit stash into travellin' cash with which to finance their new lives.\r\n\r\nBut True Romance is more than a rote tale of young lurrrve, it is essentially a series of memorable moments placed amid a sea of references to the obscure and unusual, references that Tarantino has since turned into a career obsession. \r\nThe resulting Tony Scott helmed film contains Elvis, Kung Fu movies, wannabe-black white boys, comic books, B-movie references and of course long tracts of intricately crafted dialogue.\r\n\r\nAs we saw in Pulp and Dogs, these speeches delivered from the lips of quality actors in between well directed passages of action often result in simply legendary output. Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Walken, Harvey Kietel and Steve Buscemi have the capacity to elevate. In lesser hands... er lips... not so good, (David Carradine, practically everyone in Death Proof - even Kurt Russell couldn't 'cool up' his banal speeches).\r\n\r\nTrue Romance manages a few classic moments and has introduced some legendary bit characters. In the moments category the stand off between evil mob boss Christopher Walken and humble everyman - and Clarence's Dad - Dennis Hopper is one for the ages.\r\n\r\nGary Oldman squeezes every ounce out of his drug dealing pimp Drexl, and Bronson Pinchot gets many laughs in one of his less cartoony film roles as out of his depth PA to a big time Hollywood producer Elliot Blitzer. (Brad Pitt and Samuel L Jackson have less meaty roles but do what they can to remain in the memory banks.)\r\n\r\nThe only misstep in my view is the inclusion of Val Kilmer as Elvis Presley, who appears only to Clarence as sort of his guiding angel - apparently this is a sign of Clarence's mental state but this is never really explained and comes off as a little too much - even in a film such as this.\r\n\r\nAside from the King, True Romance works because it gets the mix right between violence, laughs and even music. \r\n\r\nChristian Slater and Patricia Arquette are both perfectly capable in the central roles as Clarence and Alabama while the rest of the cast try to steal scenes from them. \r\n\r\nClarence is cocksure and confident, and Alabama is equally arresting and sassy - with Arquette's bouncing jubblies deserving acting credits of their own.\r\n\r\nIt might have turned out better in Tarantino's hands, but I'm more than happy with what the underrated Tony Scott managed to conjure up. Given his track record of turning potential mediocrity into entertaining flicks such as The Last Boy Scout, Deja Vu and last year's Unstoppable I think he deserves as much credit for the end result as Tarantino does for coming up with the script in the first place.\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 8 / 10. One or two moments from greatness. True Romance is certainly violent, profane and at times plain ridiculous. It is also fun, creative and extremely memorable.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

            "content": "\"If you gave me a million years to ponder, I would never have guessed that true romance and Detroit would ever go together.\"\n\nI would never have guessed that Tony Scott and Quentin Tarantino would ever go together, but what a pleasant surprise this romantic crime thriller turned out to be. Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record: all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film. I think I enjoyed this film more watching it for the first time now than if I would have seen it in 1993 considering there are so many familiar faces that I probably wouldn't have recognized back then. Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, and Chris Penn all have small but memorable roles. Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!\n\nClarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him: an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.\n\nEven if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed.",

She later comes clean to him that she's really a hooker, hired to keep Clarence company. After they get married, Clarence manages to steal cocaine from her pimp, and devises a plan to sell it in Hollywood. Meanwhile, the owners of the coke are trying to reclaim it.\r\n\r\nA film centering around a romance has to make us care for these characters who are in love, and buy in to their romance. I am pleased to say that this film manages to do all of the above, giving us a brilliantly believable relationship between Clarence, the charming and likable Elvis fan, and Alabama, the sweet and loyal former call-girl.\r\n\r\nGary Oldman was utterly unrecognizable as Drexl, the white drug-dealing pimp who acts like he's black. It didn't register with me that it was Gary Oldman playing Drexl until a few scenes into the film, but he manages to pull off the role with great intimidation, whilst managing to steal the scenes he appears in. Dennis Hopper plays his role remarkably well, and manages to give off a brilliant monologue to Christopher Walken's intimidating character that ranks highly amongst the best of Tarantino's written dialogue.\r\n\r\nQuentin Tarantino may not have been on directing duties for this film, but his script boasts all of the typical stuff you'd expect from a film by Tarantino himself, the well utilized use of music, the script packed with well written dialogue and witty Tarantinoesque lines (feel free to use Tarantinoesque in your every day vocabulary).\r\n\r\nThe film manages to boast a great sense of danger all throughout, as it is unafraid to kill off it's characters no matter how brilliant they are, in quite some shocking deaths. This sense of danger is pretty much pushed to the limit's in the film's bloody final act. The action is brilliant, which goes well with the unrelenting violence.\r\n\r\nI was quite disappointed to see that Christopher Walken only appeared in one scene, whilst Brad Pitt was pretty much wasted in his small role as the lazy stoner roomate. Also, I did find it strange how Clarence goes into killing due to some advice he gets from a hallucination of Elvis, played by Val Kilmer. While this  does seem like a strange way to get Clarence into actually going into killing, it does show that Clarence's love for Elvis runs much deeper than just admiration, to the point where Clarence is mentally imaging The King giving him advice and praise.\r\n\r\nTrue Romance is a very well acted film that gives us one of the best romance's you'll see on screen, great characters, brilliant action and very Tarantinoesque dialogue that slots perfectly in place alongside the other pieces of brilliance Quentin Tarantino is responsible for giving us.",

I'm surprised I had never heard of this film until only a few years ago, because it has a star-studded cast including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, and James Gandolfini. Anyway, this 1993 movie is about two people who quickly fall in love, but find themselves in a dangerous situation involving pimps, guns, drugs, and the mafia. The story is very much a QT film, with lots of violence, although there are many slower moments that focus on the romance. The director does a good job of making the main characters likable, even though they aren't very good people. All in all, it was very entertaining and a good effort from a 1993 Tarantino who was still finding his legs.",

With that said there were lots of great supporting roles.

An absolute masterpiece which features knockout performances from an incredible cast featuring, Slater, Pitt, Walken, Hopper, just too name a few. Like in any movie he is featured in, Christopher Walken absolutely owns. Patrica Arquette also delivers an amazing performance, proving that she, at the time, was one of the most talented actresses in the world. The films central subtext is romance, or somewhat a love story about two lost souls coming together. If you look at it from  different angle though, I think Tarantino's main objective in writing this film was to outline all the themes and conventions that he was well known for with his debut of Reservior Dogs. Even though Tarantino didn't direct the movie, you feel like you are watching a Tarantino film because his thumb print is so engraved in this picture. I believe Tony Scott did his amazing screenplay justice and did an amazing job in directing the film, but you can't help believe if it wasn't for the talent of Tarantino writing the script and finishing the screenplay, the film wouldn't of been half as successful as it was. And this attributes to the witty and sharp dialogue Tarantino is noted for. The film has everything for everyone who enjoys exploitation flicks.  Romance, drugs, violence, comedy, wit, intelligence, sharp and humoros dialouge, superb performances, a great cast, blaxplotation, etc. True Romance really is an entertaining rollercoaster ride which engages in twsts and turns and will have the audience begging for more all way through. I reccomend this film highly for anyone who appreciates the sheer art of B grade, low budget cinema.",

The ideas Slater gets to put them in the fast-lane are obviously high risk, and you know things are going to blow up in his face practically from the first scene, but he's tough as nails and so are the filmmakers.  The action sequences are grotesque but they're certain to grab your attention, and the cameo appearances for the sake of monologue (Walken) or comedy (Pitt) are extremely well picked.  The self-reflexive dialogue, which tended to make fun of Hollywood movies, was fun to sit through as well.  It's good to see that Tarantino had this style established for himself so early on, and that it hasn't changed much since.

I think Arquette's transformation from call girl to lovestruck and Slater's from timid to tough are too sudden to be believable but, once a firm story is set, the film takes off and never looks back.

            "content": "2.5/4.0\r\n \"True Romance\" is a fantasy-esque action love story. The romance at its center seems overblown - probably, intentionally - and the action sequences are for the most part graphically violent. I did not find myself wholeheartedly loving the movie although its core plot elements are reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino movie, one of the few living filmmakers who can craft a truly entertaining movie. Tarantino wrote the screenplay for the movie (his second big screen effort after his great debut \"Reservoir Dogs\" a year earlier) but it is directed by Tony Scott. Thankfully, the movie does not feature the director's now-signature nauseating editing and directorial style but it is hard not to believe that the movie could have been taken to a whole other level if Tarantino had directed it. (Scott changed the darker ending Tarantino had written, which would have been far more effective, but probably Scott's ending more suits the movie's fantasy theme). \r\nThe movie opens in Detroit and centers on Clarence (Christian Slater), a comic book store clerk and (kung-fu) film buff who while watching a triple feature for his birthday at a cinema gets hit on by beautiful blonde Alabama (Patricia Arquette). After the two spend a great night and make love, Alabama reveals that she is a call girl whom his boss hired as a birthday present. It is a case of extreme love of a first sight and the two marry the next day. \r\nAn impediment to their happy life is Alabama's quirky pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman in a wicked role) who Clarence visits and kills, and grabs a bag that he assumes belongs to Alabama but only to find it filled with cocaine. And from then on the two go on the run when they learn that the murder is labeled as a drug-related killing and a mob is after them. They head to LA to try and sell the drugs and start a life. \r\nA big part of the potential success of this movie has to do with the strength of the leads and their love story. I did not find myself rooting for them as much as one should and Slater and Arquette are just OK. Part of the problem is that they are overshadowed by a far stronger, A-list supporting cast (all in very brief roles) that alone makes this movie worth seeing. There's Oldman, Dennis Hopper in a heartfelt role as Clarence's security guard ex-police officer father, Christopher Walken as ruthless gangster Vincenzo Coccotti who is on the search for who stole the money (the scene between him and Hopper is one of the movie's best and most memorable), and Brad Pitt in a scene stealing role as Rapaport's stoner roommate.  Others include Michael Rapaport as an aspiring actor friend of Clarence's, Saul Rubinek as a film producer, James Gandolfini as one of Coccotti's henchmen who shares a violent encounter with Alabama, and Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn as two LA cops. Val Kilmer delivers the voice of the apparition of Clarence's idol - none other than Elvis Presley - who guides all his actions and is sort of his conscience.",

What's more, she shares all his interests and the two fall madly in love. There is one small problem however, as Alabama is actually a prostitute and still under the control of her abusive pimp Drexl (Gary Oldman). Taking it upon himself to pay Drexl a visit Clarence then finds himself high-tailing it with Alabama and a suitcase full of cocaine which invites the attention of gangsters, cops and Hollywood producers.   \n If you can imagine this film being shot in the same split-time frame structure that \"Pulp Fiction\" had, then this would give you an idea of how Tarantino intended this to look. His original screenplay was certainly layered in this way, with the characters appearing then reappearing at different times throughout the film. Sadly, we'll never get to see this, but it doesn't matter very much, as this is still an excellent ultraviolent foray into Tarantino's criminal underworld. What really makes this standout is his astute ear for dialogue, played out by an impressive ensemble of wonderful actors. There are so many excellent scenes (and performances) it's hard to pick a favourite. Crime boss Don Vincenzo (Christopher Walken) and Clarence's dad Clifford (Dennis Hopper) having a tete-a-tete over the historical inter-racial relationship between the Moors and Sicilians and Clarence's confrontation with wild-eyed, white rastafarian pimp Drexl being just a couple of numerous quality ones. Added to which, there's a brief but brilliant turn from Brad Pitt as a stoner flatmate, who uses all the toilet paper and has a liking for beer and cleaning products and James Gandolfini as a cold, sadistic hitman. Like I said, there's too many to mention. Influenced by previous 'lovers on the lam' films such as, \"Bonnie & Clyde\" and \"Badlands\" but most notably like \"Wild at Heart\" with it's numerous violent confrontations and it's array of colourful characters. Holding it's own against any one of them. I'm not director Tony Scott's biggest admirer but his hyperkinetic style actually suits the pace and explosive nature of this story and it's characters and he actually compliments Tarantino's writing.\n Stylish, gripping, violent, profane and endlessly quotable. What more do you expect when sitting down to a Tarantino flick? He may not have directed it but it still stands as one of his finest.",

            "content": "Although True Romance was directed by Tony Scott, make no mistake. Through and through, True Romance is the handiwork of Quentin Tarantino. The script he sold that funded Reservoir Dogs, True Romance is the reason that Tarantino has had the amazing career of the last 15-odd years. Without True Romance, his first script for a major studio film, Pulp Fiction would likely have not been made. And what a breakthrough. Combining elements of Tarantino's usual crime fare with a spoof of romance, True Romance is one of the best movies in his canon of work. Scott's direction is sharp, though, and despite his more linear approach to the story, as well as his far happier ending (that actually suits his version better), he contributes a worthy amount to the film's raw energy. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are perfect for their respective roles, as both are experienced enough to have real acting chops while not being recognizable enough to scoff at the whirlwind romance. The film's true strength, however, lies in its stellar supporting cast. From Dennis Hopper as the father, to Gary Oldman as the pimp, to Christopher Walken as a mob boss with a young Brad Pitt as a stoner, all the way to Val Kilmer's silhouette and voice as Elvis and even an early appearance of Samuel L. Jackson and James Gandolfini, True Romance's cast is one for the ages. Oddly, despite not being directed by Tarantino, it contains quite a few actors from his later movies, such as Pitt (Inglourious Basterds), Walken (Pulp Fiction), Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and even Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs). Among Tarantino's film, I would rank True Romance fourth, after Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds, and Reservoir Dogs, just being a hair above Kill Bill (both parts).",

The cast was just superb but I feel like certain people were underused and others were overused in an extremely annoying way. I felt extremely pissed off when I found out about the Christopher Walken/Dennis Hopper Scene and how short it actually is.\n    I don't know if anyone else feels like this but just wanted to ask ummm what casting director  thought Michael Rapaport was any kind of a decent actor? Everytime I see his annoying pasty face and hear his ridiculous voice I want to punch something. He took me out of this movie more than a once or twice. All in all this could have been so much better but don't believe the hype that its this amazing perfect classic movie from the 90s. This falls in line with Bad Lieutenant (1992) as far as movies I'd read about through out the years that people say you have to see and overblow how good they are. This ones middle of the road for me.",

            "content": "True Romance is a romantic crime saga penned by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. The story by Tarantino tells the story of Clarence who marries a lovable call-girl named Alabama. Soon after they profess their love for eachother, they get married. As her husband, Clarence feels that it's his duty to kill her pimp and erase that part of her life. Clarence ends up stealing a suitcase of cocaine from her pimp Drexl, and they get caught up in a bizzare sequence of events after the owners hastily try to reclaim it. This film boasts a memorable cast, including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, Michael Rappaport, Chris Penn, and Tom Sizemore.\r\n\r\nThis film is a masterfully written, directed pulpy 90s action flick. It's truly an ultimate guys movie. The dialogue in this film is beautiful, lurid poetry, thanks to Tarantino's witty script. The atmosphere of the film is pure Gen X romantic fantasy, due to Tony Scott's violent and vicious direction. This isn't your average romance film, and i'm sure many people refuse to call it a \"romantic\" film. It is though, this film is purely a romance. Slater and Arquette generate dynamic chemistry and the two of them together became a very likeable pair. They are a more lovable and innocent Bonnie & Clyde. \r\n\r\nChristian Slater is incredible as Clarence, an innocent Elvis loving, Sonny Chiba adoring, comic book nerd. Patricia Arquette's cute and sexy performance is a perfect companion to his child-like innocence. As I said before, the two of them produce fireworks together. They aren't the only two producing fireworks thought, their are a handful of memorable sequences in this film. A truly dark and twistedly hilarious interrogation sequence between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken stands out, and a very funny, almost deliriously over-the-top stand off at the very end of the film. This film is pure movie making magic. \r\n\r\nGary Oldman delivers a memorable performance as a white pimp who truly believes that he's black. \"You must have thought it was white boy day...\" Oh, god... Oldman is perfect in this, such a funny and cutting performance. Brad Pitt is particulary funny as a dazed stoner named Floyd, one of the smaller roles in the film but he is so damn good that it's one of the most memorable characters in the film. I could go on all day, this film is full of terrific supporting performances. Oh, also, it's a pleasure to see a pre Tony Soprano James Gandolfini. The guy can flat out act, and scare you. He's so convincing as a soul-less murdering thug.\r\n\r\nThis film has serious guts. SPOILER ALERT, almost every character in this film gets blown to bits. This is pure Taratino... this is pure Tony Scott. It's full of cheeky monologues and delirious, over-the-top gun-fights. This is a masterpiece for what it is. \r\n\r\nTrue Romance is an absolutely bizzare, lurid, brilliant romantic crime saga. One of the best films of the 90s and one of my favorite films.",

Val Kilmer - 2 scenes (barely seen), Dennis Hopper - 2 scenes. I wouldn't call Michael Rapaport and Tom Sizemore huge stars, but their presence did help, of course. As the movie itself, for 1993, this is pretty damn good. A lot of guns, drugs and sex, which is so typical for any good 90's movie. However, Tarantino touch to this didn't win my sympathy, so overall, a good movie, but not amazing.",

Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette deliver a\r\ndynamic lead portraying a lovestruck fantasy for any couple wishing to\r\nkeep their relationship on the outer realm of exciting, to say the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is superb, consisting of many big names and faces\r\nthat have rocked the silver screen for decades.

NO WAY.\r\nStraight from the opening scene you feel the Tarantino vibe straight off with the \"three kung-fu movies\" pick up line, and the music that you think it doesn't go with the film but then you realise it does, and from then on it's just endless great performances, brilliant scenes (even if some are hard to watch) and one hell of shoot-out scene. It is pretty difficult to not like this film...\r\n\r\nClarence is a comic book worker who loves Elvis and wants to be a 'bad motherfucker' just like people in the movies. Alabama is Clarenece's call girl (kind of whore) who turns out to love him and gets married to him the next day. But when Clarence goes to sort out Alabama's pimp (Gary Oldman), who looks almost exactly like Jonathan Davis from Korn, he is struck with two murders and half a million dollars worth of cocaine everything goes tits up for the newly married couple and the result is bloody and brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe amount of fantastic cameo's of this ensemble cast is just unreal ranging from Walken's crazy gangster to Pitt's dopey stoner it's just great performance after great performance. But out of all the cameo's no one can top Gary Oldman's white boy pimp with a crazy scar, the scene with him had Tarantino's smell all over it and it was by far the funniest scene in the film to. \r\nBut of course this film can't just rely on great cameo's...\r\nEnter the sexiest killing couple since Badlands, Slater and Arquette. These two young lovers are smart, strong and loyal and they definitely give one of the best performances of their careers and made a lot of teens in 1993 think what they could do with their lives...\r\n\r\nBut what really punched me in the face about this film was the two blood-rideen scenes, which were so well done and cringey that I thought there was no hope for the characters, it was too gripping in a way but so brilliant (Tarantino certainly helped out with the beating scene).\r\n\r\nBrilliant, just brilliant really, excellent performances and scenes. As I said before it's pretty hard to not like this film.\r\nRECOMMENDED\r\n5/5",

However when Clarence discovers the violent nature of Alabama's former pimp Drexl, he goes round to kill the pimp in an attempt to free Alabama from her past life. But not everything goes to plan and ends up throwing the pair in a world of shit. As usual the dialogue in the film is top notch from Tarantino, but the directing style of Tony Scott moves the story on a bit too quickly; making it seem quite predictable. But True Romance still holds up as a good film with actors such as Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, and Brad Pitt all adding to the film. There is a brilliant scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in a trailer, where Hopper's character tells Walken that all Sicilian men are of Black descent, which is one of the funniest scenes in a film.

            "content": "True Romance may have been directed by Tony Scott and told in a somewhat linear fashion, but it still has Tarentino writtien all over it, and like most of his movies, its good, damn good.  Tarentino only wrote the screenplay for this one and sold it to make enough money to fund his debut film Reservoir Dogs which came out a year earlier.  The dialogue is the same as everything else he's written, perfect.  It's funny and sounds real.  I've always liked Tarentino's scripts the best because they remind me of how me and my freunds talk.  We never talk about what we're doing just discuss random stuff.  Tarentino is the only writer who understands this.  It tells the story of Clarence who meets and falls in love with a girl named Alabama who just happens to be a call girl for an abusing pimp.  He goes, kills the pimp & takes what he believes are Alabama's belongings.  It turns out to be just a suitcase full of half a million dollars worth of cocaine.  The rest of the movie is spent with Clarence trying to sell it and the gangsters who owned it chasing him.  The directing by Tony Scott is good, but not as good as if Tarentino himself had directed it.  It's typical for a crime-action movie and suits it well enough.  The music is kind of weird, sometimes it fits, sometimes it doesn't, not much else to say about it.  The highlight is not in the actors, but the characters they play.  They're all original yet familiar.  Clarence played by Christian Slater, which is probably his best performance, is just you're average guy.  He works at a comic book store, goes to movies in his spare time for fun, and doesn't really know what he's doing.  Alabama, played by Patricia Arquette, is just a sad girl who you never really can understand whats up with her.  She's a mystery and that's what is so entriguing about her.  The rest of the characters are fantastic, Christopher Walken as a gangster, James Gandolfini as his hitman, Dennis Hopper as Clarences dad (who gives the best diss in movie history, calling Walken a 'eggplant' to which Walken replies \"You're a cantelope\", Brad Pitt as a hilarious stoner who never leaves the couch, Michael Rapaport as a wannabe actor, and a drug crazed movie producer clearly influenced by Oliver Stone.  True Romance certainly isn't the best thing to ever come out of Quentin Tarentino's mind, but it's still worth checking out.",

There is a great 8-10 minute scene with Hopper and Walkens characters, James Gandholfini shows that he can play a tough roughless gangster and this is was one of the reasons David Chase decided to select him for the role of Tony Soprano in classic HBO television show The Sopranos, The Shoot-Out scene at the end is also awesome. This is one of Tarantinos best screenplays and I think this could have been even better if Tony Scott had decided to go with the intial script that Tarantino had written instead of changing it for a more hollywood happy ending. The Alternative ending which is in the Tarantino version has Clarence die in the Shoot-Out and ends with Alabama leaving with the money alone, She then has a short monologue before we see the credits roll. This film is also shown in Non-Linear format, Same format in which we have seen Quentin use in his pictures on more than one occasion in the past : Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This version is avaliable off torrent sites it is titled \"The Tarantino Cut\", I believe it is fan made but it is excellant, Recommended any a fan of True Romance. Overall I think True Romance is often overlooked and one of the most underated films of the 90's.",

True Romance was written by Quentin Tarantino, something that you should notice if you watch his movies, but it was directed by Ridley Scott. It features a heck of a cast, including Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pit, Christopher Walken, Val Kilmer, Michael Rapaport, Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore, Samuel L. Jackson and even James Gandolfini! Some of these actors have pretty small roles, but everyone contributes so fine, that as a whole, this cast is perfect, and maybe is one of the greatest of all times. The movie is great - it's fun, it's funny, it's full of action, it's romantic, it has great music (and the main theme by Hans Zimmer is excellent) and great dialogues (Tarantino, anyone?). Stealing, Cheating, Killing. Who said romance is dead?",

I can't see myself wanting more from this film, aside from a few more scenes like we saw in the first 30 minutes, focussing on the romance of the two leads. Those scenes were so well-handled that I felt the need to see so much more of that, but I understand that we eventually had to go on to bigger and better things.

I really doubt that \"True Romance\" would have been the way it is if the director were Quentin Tarantino.\r\n\r\nOne of the best elements of this film is its actors. You can almoust say it is a dream cast. You'll find many likable who are strong enough to play leading roles. The cast is so big and excellent that often you will find yourself disapointed because of the screentime from one or the other actor. The example would be a famous Sicilian scene, where we see Hoper's and Walken's characters for the last time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the scrip is extraordinary, but story somehow doesn't seems right. It isn't bad but it more seems like dream of blonde girl. \r\n\r\nAs I said for me the story was a bit unrealistic, but all other elements including and script is cinema at it's best.",

They decide to move out LA where the drug scene is huge, sell it off, and move down to Cancun. Simple, right? Wrong, you've got the supplier of the coke, a mob boss, the cops, and many others after the two love birds over this coke. There's a certain mystosism about this movie, with the Elvis mentor, played by Val Kilmer, who comes off as the dirty conscience that Clarence seems to listen to and the heavy bond of love between Clarence & Alabama, this movie just seems to hit all the right notes of what it is...a love story...with violence. And only Tarantino could write it. With Tony Scott's sick direction at the helm, you've got a fast paced film that knows the speed for the viewer.

            "content": "TRUE ROMANCE is a hip and hot action romance from the mind of Quentin Tarantino and eye of Tony Scott.  The leads look great, they act even better (along with the rock-solid ensemble cast) and the romance and action comes fast and furious (not to mention quite bloody).  The pace of the film moves like nobody's business.  You will gawk at how many famous actors are in this film: Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn (R.I.P.), Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Michael Rapaport, and Samuel L. Jackson!  Yes, this is a cast that is electric as a power plant.  \r\n\r\nSpeaking of electricity, sparks fly when a man and a woman meet at a Detroit bar, Clarence and Alabama.  They go to a kung-fu movie marathon (and as a trademark of movie buff Tarantino, talk about movies and Elvis for most of the film), and find true romance in their time together.  Alabama was a callgirl (for four days) until she met Clarence.  Clarence works at a comic book store (kind of like Tarantino's video clerk gig before he hit it big!), and feels that Alabama is the one.  So they get married, but not before Clarence takes out Alabama's former pimp.  With a suitcase of supposedly \"money\" in his hand, Clarence takes Alabama to L.A. to start a new life together.  That is, unless the mob who owns the \"money\" and the cops have something to say about it.  \r\n\r\nNow that you got the gist of TRUE ROMANCE, let me say that this is a film inspired by the pop culture of movies and how people percieve real life in correspondence to movies.  It's easy to be aware that you're watching a movie, but when a movie itself is aware that it's playing with the reality of the main characters' situation is something else.  \r\n\r\nClarence and Alabama hold a similar relationship to Quentin Tarantino's other story's anti-heroes, NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  That couple were murderous psychopaths who found thrill in killing, while Clarence and Alabama are lovebirds who heaped themselves in a worldwind of trouble through theft from the mob.  \r\n\r\nTony Scott surely stylizes the story with fast editing and brutal, intense violence, yet he films Quentin Tarantino's story with an honest sensibility that lets you have fun with the main characters and their obsession with blending their obsession to movies with real life.  \r\n\r\nTRUE ROMANCE is a seminal 90's film, and a hip and hot action romance.  You will feel electrified by the performances and the furious and bloody action that goes down in TRUE ROMANCE.  If there's one moral to be learned from TRUE ROMANCE, that would be to never screw with the Mob!  Be ready for more Critiques and Opinions on Every Movie I Can Get My Hands On!",

However, he made Reservoir Dogs (1992) as his debut, he decided to let Tony Scott direct this film, which QT has called \"his most autobiographical film\". Maybe that's why he couldn't direct it, but it is a brilliant film, with an amazing cast and made a great director. It has movie buff Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) meeting call girl Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), who was hired by Clarence's boss as a birthday present. Alabama falls in love with Clarence, and they marry. Clarence tells Alabama's pimp Drexl Spivey (Gary Oldman) that he's married, and wants to cut ties. It ends in murder, and Clarence ends up with a suitcase full of pure uncut cocaine, who they decide to give it to Clarence's actor friend Dick Ritchie (Michael Rapaport) living in Hollywood, he has contacts, such as actor Elliot (Bronson Pinchot) who knows movie producer Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek) who will have it, but unknown to Clarence and Alabama, gangster Vincenzo Coccotti (Christopher Walken) is hot on their tail, looking for the cocaine. This is a smart, savvy film with great dialogue and some brilliant performances, also including Val Kilmer as Clarence's mentor Elvis Presley, Brad Pitt as junkie Floyd and Dennis Hopper as Clarence's Dad Clifford, who gives a brilliant speech in the film. Filled with Scott's usual flair for amazing glossy visuals and fast editing. This is a clever, funny and surprising film that never gets boring.",

But why I saw the film is inconsequential.  What I thought of the film is the important part.  I found the movie to be quite good.  The cast was terrific, and the dialogue was typical Tarantino awesome.  And like I said before, Tony Scott is okay, but he's no Ridley Scott.  I didn't like this particular story as much as Tarantino's other creations, however.  It was a bit simple, and the climax where absolutely everyone gets shot seems like a bit of a cop out.  And while the film has one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, most of the parts are criminally short.  Oldman, Hopper, Pitt, and Walken are only in one or two scenes tops, and have only a handful of lines.  Sure, it's nice to see minor parts in such good hands, but more would have been appreciated.  But, it's a fun, unique movie that couldn't help but thoroughly enjoy.",

Many of what would become his trademark elements are here: over-the-top violence, a huge cast, lots of idiosyncratic dialogue, drugs, references to kung-fu movies, and an overall celebration of American kitsch. There are even a number of actors he would hire again: Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, and Samuel L. Jackson are all here. This is a little bit different from his other movies, though, in that it centers on an actually halfway sincere love story. Christian Slater (who's ok here as a Tarantino-esque geek) and Patricia Arquette (who's actually pretty excellent as a hooker with a heart of gold) are a couple on the run from the mob and the police with a suitcase full of cocaine. Of course lots of complications and violence ensue. Dennis Hopper has a decent small role as Slater's father, and Gary Oldman is surprisingly convincing as an unbelievably hideous and vile pimp who seems to think he is a Jamacian. James Gandolfini shows up as a mobster long before he got to play Tony Soprano. Val Kilmer is in a couple of scenes as Elvis, though we never really get to see him clearly. Brad Pitt's part is tiny but amusing as a permanently stoned slacker. Michael Rapaport is funny as a terrible actor. The director Tony Scott, although he has a tendency to turn his movies into over-edited, ADD messes, is thankfully restrained enough here that you can actually tell what is going on. There's a strange calypso music score by Hans Zimmer (why calypso? I have no idea). My biggest complaint is with the movie's climax, which seems to inexplicably skip half the necessary scene. If you like Tarantino's other movies, especially Reservoir Dogs, you'll like this one as well, though it's not quite as good as the rest.",

Honestly, Christian Slater is the one fault of the movie, since he seems to be overrated and untalented. Gary Oldman was not given near enough face-time and could have easily won awards for his brilliant role. And let's not forget that captivating scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken; a meeting of two hollywood giants carrying incredible weights of talent. This movie plays out well, though one can't help think what it would have been like if Tarantino directed.",

            "content": "A couple weekends ago, a very fine actor named Dennis Hopper passed away. Like many film buffs, I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the Hollywood renegade. Regrettably, I have never seen the film that several cite as his masterpiece, 'Easy Rider,' the druggie road movie from the '60s, also directed by Hopper. This may be why I prefer Hopper's work from 1986 on, when his best acting for the screen arrived. The man who famously played the eccentric acolyte in âApocalypse Nowâ toned it down just a hair (after sobering up his personal life), but whether he was delightfully hamming it up as the villain in âSpeedâ or making a quiet cameo in âEdTV,â those wild eyes, that hippie dialectâ¦ that character he made himself to be, all of it was always present.\n\nThe day of his death, I looked through an online photo gallery showcasing Hopper's most notable contributions to film and was once again reminded of the phenomenal scene he shares with Christopher Walken in 'True Romance.' As a whole, the scene is damn near perfect film-making, mostly because the acting portion of it IS perfect. It easily makes my top three thespian moments of 1990s cinema.\n\nIf only the rest of the film could compare. \n\nDon't get me wrong - I own the \"2-disc Special Edition Unrated Director's Cut\" because it's a pretty fun flick - there's just no denying the layer of lunacy the entire movie rests on. I think the screenwriter, none other than Quentin Tarantino, realized its zaniness either while or after writing it, so he sold the script to allow Tony Scott ('Top Gun,' 'The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3') to direct instead of himself, tinkering with the image he was building. Screenplay's faults aside, all Tarantino fans can rest easy knowing that the dialogue is still unmistakeably Tarantino's, waxing poetic of pop culture references ranging from martial arts star Sonny Chiba to Elvis Presley (and that's just before the opening credits). There's even an unnecessary Samuel L. Jackson cameo.\n\nChristian Slater and Patricia Arquette lead this 'Bonnie and Clyde'-meets-'Scarface' all-star extravaganza as the lovebirds Clarence, the usually mellow comics store manager madly in love with \"the King,\" and Alabama, a rookie prostitute who believes in monogamy in the case of love. They do a fairly decent job keeping this cavalcade together, but the characters' PDA, despite the unexpectedly nice chemistry between the actors, gets irksome a time or two. They're definitely not the worst performances of the picture; I'll give those dishonors to Tom Sizemore, more manic than Robin Williams as an L.A.P.D. detective, and Saul Rubinek, WAY overacting as a coke-snorting Hollywood producer. \n\nPoor Val Kilmer does what he can as Elvis/Clarence's inner dialogue (and I like the choice not to show his face), but one more scene in the middle would've been courteous to the character's player and to the story. Every other performance is terrific. Having already mentioned Hopper and Walken, there's also Brad Pitt, on perfect low-key pitch as beach-garbage stoner (and accidental snitch) Floyd. One step below these three, the next batch consists of Gary Oldman as a deadly pimp convinced he's black, pre-\"Sopranos\" James Gandolfini as a creepy, murderous mob goon, Bronson Pinchot (yup, Balki from ABC's sitcom \"Perfect Strangers\") as an unfortunate, sniveling piss-ant stool pigeon, and (to my great surprise) Michael Rappaport as Clarence's innocent simpleton friend aspiring to be a paid actor. Also nice to see Chris Penn and Paul Ben-Victor in there too.\n\nMy friend Josh Glasgow beat me to the punch in circling the music as the number one problem. The xylophone score by Hans Zimmer (titled \"You're So Cool\" after Alabama's love letter via bev-nap to Clarence) is one of the composer's best and most recognizable, but other than during the epilogue, it has absolutely no place in this film (My theory: He was hoping to pull off magic similar to the zither score of 'The Third Man'). The soundtrack selections are even worse. Loud techno makes Clarence's confrontation with Alabama's employer unbearable, and the cliche choice to underscore the Hopper-Walken interrogation with LÃ©o Delibes' \"The Flower Duet\" is my only complaint with the best scene of the film. The rest of the soundtrack mainly consists of oldies too successful in their respective times to be deemed \"Tarantinoesque,\" clearly the failed goal.\n\nAs I bring this review to a close, I feel like I've unfairly torn 'True Romance' a new one. If you leave behind your common sense and just allow the film to be what Tony Scott has chosen it to be, it's a successful amusement park trip complete with cotton candy... if you can stomach the abundance of violence. Even if you can't, the final feathery shootout will probably still make you roll your eyes, shake your head, and snicker. Glad 'True Romance' was made, but even happier Tarantino passed on directing. Wise choice on his half.",

The superb screenwriting is obviously the work of the amazingly original Quentin Tarantino. Possibly the best scene in the whole movie is the 10-minute exchange between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, which really helps show the art and beauty behind the writing of this movie. Christopher Walken dominates the atmosphere for the first 5 or 6 minutes, until Hopper accepts (or refuses it depending on how you look at it) his situation and completely takes over the wheel from there. The film's two lead characters differ greatly from your typical Tarantino unsympathetic protagonists. They seem to have at least a little bit of a moral drive. They sell cocaine to get some money, but they never use it. Clarence kills a pimp for the greater good, but has his own doubts about doing it. Alabama kills a gangster in self-defense, after refusing to give up her husband. And (spoilers) then they have a kid and spend the rest of their lives spending. Its cast is greatly directed by Tony Scott, and largely makes this movie what it is.",

They have a one night stand and they become very much in love with one another and get married the next day. He soon finds out that she is a hooker and decides he wants to pay a little visit to her pimp, beautifully portrayed by Gary Oldman. Well Drexler, thats the pimps name, does not take kindly to Clarence telling him that Alabama is no longer his possesion and a violent fight breaks out.\r\nNow I wont tell you what happens but Clarence leaves grabbing what he thinks is Alabamas things, but turns out to be a suitcase full of cocaine. \r\nSo he and his new bride decide to head to California and try to sell the cocaine and now he has the mob, the police and movie producers wanting what he has.\r\nThe action sequences are thrilling, especially the last 30 minutes. The directing is great and the script, written by Quentin Tarantino  (his first), is pure gold when it comes to the dialogue. The most perfect example of that would be the scene where Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper have a sit down and chat, excellent scene.\r\nGreat acting all around, a very well put together cast for this particular story. You have Christopher Walken, Christian Slater, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt (who is just a riot as a stoner), Bronson Pinchot, James Gandolfini (great role), Tom Sizemore (when I see him in this film it makes me sad that he pissed his acting career away on drugs), Samuel L. Jackson,Saul Rubinek, Chris Penn (also makes me sad because he died at a very young age), and Michael Rapaport.\r\nThis is one of Tonys Scotts best films, and not many have heard about it. The only thing I did not like about this picture was Patricia Arquette, I have never liked her and in this film she is a little better but still annoying.\r\nI love this fim, it takes me back to a time where I was having a rough time in my llife and I would watch this movie as a pick me up cause some points of the movie I can relate. We all want to escape the evil in life, but we first have to destroy the obstacles that stand in our way.\r\nHighly recommend this action thrilled, funny film.\r\n4.5 out of 5",
