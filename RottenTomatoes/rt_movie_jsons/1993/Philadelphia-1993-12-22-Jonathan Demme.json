            "content": "Jonathan Demme's \"Philadelphia\" is an intimate, poignant and heartbreaking legal drama that sheds light on the struggles faced by AIDS victims in the 1980's. With his fifteenth feature, director Jonathan Demme tackled the sensitive subject of HIV/AIDS with compassion and empathy that was rare for the time. Using gorgeous cinematography, Demme draws viewers into the world of a homosexual lawyer that experiences discrimination in 1980's Philadelphia. From captivating close-ups to disorienting dutch angle shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's setting. Demme displays immense control over the technical aspects, editing techniques and musical score, immersing viewers into the perspective of an AIDS victim. Ron Nyswaner's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses non-linear storytelling to create a compelling portrait of a homosexual AIDS victim. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. Tom Hanks delivers one of the best performances of his career as Andrew Beckett. With riveting expressions, he conveys the desperation, grief and righteous anger of an AIDS victim that is unfairly treated by the judicial system. Denzel Washington is equally excellent in the role of a homophobic attorney that is forced to confront his prejudiced views. In one of his finest roles, Washington imbues shades of humanity into an inherently dislikable character. Although \"Philadelphia\" is undeniably an unforgettable legal drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from a formulaic conclusion. It's an overly sentimental finale that overwhelms viewers with its heavy-handed AIDS message. Nevertheless, fans of legal dramas will definitely enjoy \"Philadelphia\" and so will movie-goers seeking heartfelt entertainment. In an industry often criticized for its insensitive depictions of homosexuals, it's a stirring reminder that the stories of AIDS patients deserve to be seen and heard.",

            "content": "I had inexplicably never seen this film, despite the fact that it features two of the biggest actors to appear on screen in my lifetime, giving equally moving performances. Demme deserves credit for displaying a well honed touch, balancing between the clinical nature of a legal thriller and the emotional warmth necessary when showcasing such personal human drama. It never hurts to stick the landing either, as Demme and company do here.\n\nGrowing up I was still always very familiar with the plot of Philadelphia and, aside from Magic Johnson's announcement a couple of years earlier, the discussions that came about because of this film were some of the first times I became aware of this disease and the awful stigmas attached, many which have thankfully improved in the years since.\n\nEven though some of the redeeming characters thoughts still appear dated (to put it kindly) this can be viewed as a positive, as far too often the refrain after watching a social (in)justice based drama is \"What a shame not much has changed in X years or decades...\". In this case it is encouraging to see how much public perception has changed in the nearly thirty years since this film's release, most evident through the dated stereotypes and language exhibited casually throughout that, when heard today, have acquired a historical and antiquated sheen.",

            "content": "Demme reflects America's homophobia back onto itself with sheer empathy.\n\nJonathan Demme is a heartfelt director of brave authenticity and true auteur skillfulness. His artful direction for his devastating legal drama Philadelphia (1993) speaks for itself. He clearly bears sympathy for the LGBTQ community in Philadelphia as he depicts a gay man in his prime struck down by the AIDS virus. Ron Nyswaner's script is brilliant as he accurately touts legal knowledge, genuine sympathy for minorities and gay Americans, and tender family drama that hits you hard.\n\nDemme's beautiful direction focuses on this man to force America's bias against gay people to light and make them see how hurtful and cruel they are in reality. Demme humanizes the AIDS epidemic by showing the vast victims' suffering as well as the tragic impact this has on their family. Meanwhile, he cleverly has a homophobic character co-lead Philadelphia to show how their bigotry and spitefulness only reflects poorly on them and their morals. Again and again, Demme subtly directs Philadelphia to depict and dispel rumors about AIDS to ensure empathy for the LGBTQ community and inform the public about a terrible disease.\n\nTak Fujimoto's cinematography is stunning with Demme's signature style of ultra zoomed in close-up shots of faces for expressive, intimate drama. You cannot hide any emotion when Fujimoto has the camera right in the face of his actors. It's very effective, revealing, and intimate filmmaking throughout Philadelphia. Craig McKay's editing is very tight keeping Philadelphia to a sleek and polished 126 minutes that feels like half that length. Howard Shore's lovely symphonic score is tender and affectionate, creating an aura of sympathy for Demme's characters. I love Colleen Atwood's striking outfits with precise detail and fitted for each person. Carl Fullerton and Edna Sheen's make-up realistically does Tom Hanks up like he's dying from AIDS with pale and jaunt choices to truly shock you as you witness Hanks deteriorate on screen gradually throughout Philadelphia.\n\nTom Hanks is so genuinely moving that I cried during Philadelphia. His subtle, calm acting is increasingly powerful as he authentically portrays a gay man coping with AIDS as best he can. Denzel Washington is poignant as a homophobic lawyer, who chooses to defend Hanks in a wrongful termination lawsuit, and in doing so he learns to be more tolerate of those with alternative lifestyles to his own. They are touching as an on screen duo.\n\nAntonio Banderas is so strong and emotionally devastating as Hanks' boyfriend. Mary Steenburgen is excellent as the prosecuting lawyer in a rare mean performance from this legendary screen charmer. You just despise Jason Robards as the opposing law firm's CEO for his vile hateful homophobia and unsympathetic views. On the other hand, Joanne Woodward is a sweet darling as Tom Hanks' supportive mother in a gentle supporting actress role.\n\nIn all, Philadelphia's moving message of acceptance for the LGBTQ community, understanding of the AIDS virus, and equality under the law are elevated by Jonathan Demme's phenomenal direction. Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington give two of the best acting showcases here ever.",

But feels like it doesn't quite get to the level of artistry as other LGBT performative explorations of its time. There are a few levels it could've crossed and explored to get there. Perhaps this was in fear of distancing itself from the heterosexual mainstream--baby steps, ya know; at least it created some humanizing exposure for that community. Perhaps, it would've benifited from more of that and lay off just a touch of the homophobia. Tom Hanks is really good and his opera monologue is extraordinary.",

Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington provide so much depth to their characters in their close-up shots and do an exceptional job of portraying the internal perspectives and conflicts of their own respective characters. Following Joe Miller, Denzel Washington, as he finds himself struggling in an internal fight between his old, bigoted, and homophobic views and his new found values of love and sympathy, not only for the familiar, but for all that deserve to be loved, and watching this new found value push him past discrimination and prejudice is a holy experience. At the same time, it is absolutely tormenting and heartbreaking to watch Andrew Beckett, Tom Hanks, fight AIDS and the prejudice against AIDS patients while he marches towards an accepted death. The La Mamma Morta sequence is without a doubt one of the most spectacular scenes I have seen in my life as Tom Hanks's performance and Denzel Washington's internalization of his character are magical. The directing choices of Jonathan Demme, rest in peace and may the soil on his grave be plenty, as well as his subtle use of instruments are fascinating and on point. I would recommend seeing this movie alone or with people whose company you truly enjoy to get the full experience.",

With eerie camera work and enabling a cheesy environment in a professional work environment, this method is off putting and disenchanting the powerful words Ron Nyswaner; the writer, wrote. And this is how powerful his words are, for despite of having these many flaws, the film is one big powerhouse of drama. With monologues or speeches or even conversation drawn in for satire that are itself free from any whatsoever strings of the storyline.\n\nPersonally, among multiple such sequences, I connected the most when Andrew (Tom Hanks) gets lost on listening the Opera and describing the lyrics to Joe (Denzel Washington) with body language so flamboyant that you melt away in his performance. And this is film's major asset; the cast. With A list actors such as Hanks and Washington sharing the screen, there is an elevation in each scene as these two charge heavily on to others. Washington has a powerful three dimensional character to play, primarily because it struggles with his own issues along with a case that he is fighting which is about the very personal conflicts.\n\nHanks is on the softer side of the door, he is mostly incapable of taking charge with power. He is a pure magic while seducing you, with a slow speech and low voice, he is wiser than others and also humbler. The courtroom drama, as Washington says before the trial begins, is not your usual tear jerking melodrama but a long hard boxing match where you are not going to win by a knockout punch. Philadelphia is exactly as the title song states, advanced and also gullible on the acceptance logistics, either way, this cast lives up to the hype they come up with; style and excellence.",

That startling reminder of how rampant and even acceptable homophobia and AIDS panic was in our culture is not fun. It makes you both embarrassed that people used to behave in this way, and frustrated that we are still fighting the same battles among ourselves now in slightly different ways. It’s great that Tom Hanks (also known as America’s Dad) is the one who takes on the lead role because it’s almost impossible to dislike him. He makes you care for the character, and not just because we watch his health degrade on screen. However, Denzel Washington didn’t quite fit the role for this film. The script wants us to think of him as an ambulance-chasing lawyer, and he presents himself as too distinguished and skilled to be that type of character. I did appreciate how he became the change character of the film, but I wish we saw more of him softening towards homosexuals so we could appreciate why he changed his attitude. My biggest struggle with Philadelphia is that it suffers from an identity crisis. The movie tells a compelling story, and has many elements that I appreciate, but it never feels like they commit to what kind of movie they are trying to make. There are times when it feels like this is going to be a courtroom drama, and I love those sections, but they leave out many aspects that you’d expect in that type of movie. It lacks some of the dramatic thrust that I anticipate in a courtroom film, and the verdict seems extreme based on the parts of the trial we see. Other times it feels like a statement film that is trying to promote tolerance and understanding of the AIDS virus, but that also is not explored to a satisfying extent. They don’t spend much time looking at the negative assumptions people make about contracting HIV (although it is implied a few times,) and as I discussed before they don’t detail the motives that cause a bigot to change his tune. Philadelphia is not a bad or broken film, but with a bit more focus I think it could be timeless and great.",

In an attempt to hide his disease, Hank's is fired by his law firm supposedly on the grounds of incompetence, which is debatable given his recent promotion by the directors themselves. Whilst battling his illness, he enlists the help of fellow barrister Denzel Washington, himself fearful of contracting the disease, but sympathising with the victim as a result of his own battle against racism. Together they fight for justice, with the outcome typically revealed moments before Hank's is hospitalised. It's quite a gripping tale which will split audiences right down the middle with its appeal and decision to tackle such taboo subjects on the big screen. Some will be emotional overcome, others left unimpressed, whilst most will enjoy the critically acclaimed production due to its professional depiction of such widespread issues. Can you call this entertainment, or is it an education? It's a tough one to call, but I found it gripping and intriguing throughout. You get a sense of how this will all pan out, but knowing the outcome doesn't detract in any way from the concluding scenes of the movie, in fact you'd be left disappointed if it tried to script this in any other way. Bolstered by A-lister actors, this becomes a memorable viewing, which will leave a lasting impression for many viewers to come.",

Tom Hanks is really great in this and does a good job playing a homosexual man that never seem to be obvious which would've been stereotypical. When the his character has AIDS, you can see the stages of it which the make-up people did a great job of making it look realistic, and Tom Hanks as well for giving a sense of what would a person act like if they have AIDS. The story is really interesting, even if it's like other courtroom dramas. The writing is well done, and the characters are well developed. It's funny at times, and the direction by Jonathan Demme is well-shotted. The courtroom scenes are really interesting and are usually the best part on the film.

Denzel Washington is also electric as his usual smooth-talking, commander of the room, so of course he plays the lawyer defending, Hanks and almost steals the show! The supporting cast is also solid, though I wish more time had been spent on the relationship between Banderas and Hanks (though some of their scenes were cut for time). The plot is tragic and compelling with Hanks' character contracting HIV and then being promptly fired from his promising career; but was it his sickness or sexual preference that got him fired? The rest unfolds like your standard courtroom procedural and unfortunately succumbs to a few cliches of the genre, but the performances are so strong and the story so moving that you can easily overlook them. Philadelphia is an excellent film that tackles the taboo subjects that are unfortunately still around today with point-blank bravery, and sincerity that addresses the issue humbly and should not be missed.",

Andy comes from the upper class, his family loves him and does not mind that he is gay, he has a beautiful apartment and loving boyfriend. The only way we find out that he is gay is because he says so and his, played by Antonio Banderas (which can also be considered stereotypical or racist), boyfriend Miguel calls him 'honey'.

It holds our hand a bit more than is really necessary, and tirelessly beats us over the head with its point, but it feels like that sort of treatment was somewhat necessary for such a controversial issue in the early '90s. Tom Hanks is revelatory in the lead role, balancing his usual bubbling vat of character with a potent, hard-edged determination to fight for the justice he's due. Not to harp on the morality of the times too much, but I don't think it can be understated how important this casting was, both for the film and its lead actor. The level of good-natured, approachable personality that Hanks wears on his chest is crucial to humanizing the character, making him more than just the sick, faceless member of an alien culture. That we'd laughed with him so many times already makes it all the more powerful to see him near death, struggling to remain upright in bed as the disease ravages his body. Denzel Washington fails to keep pace as his moderately scummy, though well-spoken lawyer, an awkward personification of the ugly, ignorant target audience, but he nails a few convincing courtroom speeches and has his come-to-Jesus moment, which is all we really need from the role. It can get clunky at times, but Philadelphia's message remains potent and profound, even amidst the vastly-shifted modern landscape.",

The story is infinitely more interesting and far easier to digest with its courtroom-drama format. Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks both deliver very strong acting performances. Hanks plays his part in such a way that he helps break down stereotypes by showing that homosexuals are not so different from straight people. There are a few sincere moments between the main character and his partner, played by Antonio Banderas and a warm family visit. This is nice, but it treads too lightly and does not attempt to get very emotional. I feel like the climactic opera scene between Hanks and Washington is not particularly effective. Once again, this shortchanges the story's positive emotion. It finds a nice middle ground that effectively shows the ugliness of the AIDS disease but shows tasteful restraint and does not go into too far with painful details. The ending is predictably sad, but the character transformation of Denzel Washington's character helps soften the blow. It is an inspiring movie, and the good acting along with the quality courtroom drama makes it a strong movie.",

O que de fato estabelece \"Filadélfia\" como um grande clássico hollywoodiano, sem dubiedade alguma, são seus atores. \n\nA começar por Tom Hanks, que impressiona como o advogado Andrew Beckett, em uma das melhores interpretações de sua carreira (inferior talvez ao seus papéis em \"Náufrago\" e \"Forrest Gump\"). O ator se sai irrevogavelmente bem nesta interpretação, mas infelizmente (ou felizmente) acaba tendo o bom trabalho eclipsado pela fantástica e mais uma vez imperdível atuação de Denzel Washington.  Ambas performances se colidem de forma tão formidável que logo se torna quase impossível dar uma escolha certa de qual dos dois deram o melhor trabalho do filme.\n\nO final é satisfatoriamente comovente, causando uma profunda sensação de nostalgia no espectador. A faixa \"Neil Young\" é mais que suficiente para levar o cinéfilo a experimentar a sensação de ser o personagem do Tom Hanks e desta forma conduzi-lo à um universo de inúmeras dificuldades enfrentadas pelo personagem (seja pela sua opção sexual ou pela sua obtenção de Aids). As lágrimas logo tornam-se incapazes de serem controladas e a angústia se torna ainda maior após o encerramento do filme. Afinal, aquela \"ficção\" que concluímos de ver é na realidade um retrato concretizado de uma sociedade praticante de um preconceito tão abundante a ponto de não consegue sentir mais aquilo que, nos dias atuais, é o que há mais de escasso neste mundo: o amor ao próximo.",

            "content": "The Movie About the Gay Lawyer With AIDS  \r\n\r\nThe thing is, it's really the movie about the straight lawyer who comes to recognize that the gay lawyer with AIDS is a person who deserves respect.  Despite the fact that Tom Hanks won Best Actor for this, I don't actually believe that Andrew Beckett is the main character.  This is something I've encountered repeatedly.  We think of it as a movie about him, and in a way, it is; everything that happens is because we're following his story, it's true.  However, we are not really following his story through his own eyes for the most part.  We know that, as much as we're supposed to be on the side of his character, the person we're really supposed to be identifying with is the straight guy, Denzel Washington's Joe Miller.  And while it's true that, mathematically, US audiences of this film were more likely to be black than gay, it's also true that the character was written to be white until Denzel Washington wanted the role.\r\n\r\nBoth Beckett and Miller are attorneys working in Philadelphia.  Miller is \"that TV guy,\" a lawyer who tends to specialize in personal injury.  Beckett is an associate for one of those highbrow law firms with a long name, though it's generally just referred to as Wyatt Wheeler.  When he defeats Miller on an important case, he is made a senior associate.  And then, one of the partners notices a small purple lesion on Beckett's face.  Beckett has kept his private life private, though he has a long-term partner, Miguel Álvarez (Antonio Banderas).  He certainly has not revealed his illness.  But then one day, while he is home with serious health problems, an important file is briefly \"lost.\"  Beckett is blamed and fired, even though the file is found before the deadline.  He sues the firm, saying that someone else within the firm caused the crisis so they'd have cause to fire him, and the real reason is that he has AIDS.  Miller is the only lawyer who will take his case.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange to me that as many of the characters wig out about actually knowing a gay person.  I mean, yes, this was all twenty years ago, and I'm not sure I knew that I knew anyone gay at the time.  Then again, I was in high school at the time, and my friends who have since come out hadn't yet.  However, I know I spent part of the summer of '93 convincing a younger kid that, no, not all gay people act like stereotypes, and no, there's nothing wrong with being gay.  And certainly no one I know was paranoid about getting AIDS through casual contact that late.  Possibly, we might have been five years earlier, but of course I grew up as part of the first generation to have lived in the era of AIDS education in the schools.  It was literally incomprehensible to me the first time I saw this that anyone still believed the paranoid stuff that Miller seems to be regurgitating from the mid-'80s.  It's enough to make you think the script floated around for years before getting made.\r\n\r\nSo probably I was, even in 1993, the choir they were hoping to avoid preaching to.  I know that the casting of Tom Hanks and the song by Bruce Springsteen were both deliberately planned to give the movie a wider audience.  I've been thinking lately that it's silly that we need films to tell us what to believe, but silly or not, it still seems to be a requirement that some people have.  So yeah, a big-budget Hollywood movie about how people with AIDS are just like everyone else, even when they're gay [i]and[/i] have AIDS, was probably necessary and probably changed a whole bunch of minds.  I suspect that it's tied in to the fact that you're more likely to be tolerant of an ostracized group when you know someone who is a member of that group.  Reasonably or not, we think of people we see in fiction as people we know.  And, as Tom Hanks himself put it, he does have that reputation for being nice, and how can you not like even a gay lawyer with AIDS when he's played by Tom Hanks?\r\n\r\nWell, you can be Fred Phelps, who apparently calls this one of his favourite comedies.  But I don't believe he means that; I believe he is saying it to provoke a reaction.  Silly or not, maudlin or not, this is one of those movies that changed a lot of how people see things.  Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington made an abstract concept personal for a lot of people.  (Well, and Jonathan Demme, but most people don't think directors, they think actors.)  What happens to Andrew Beckett in this movie is wrong.  He was a good lawyer who was fired for reasons that had nothing to do with his ability at his job; they had to do with the prejudices of his employers.  Since pretty much everyone has had a job with a boss who was \"out to get them,\" that's about as personal as you can make it for most people.  Okay, most of us aren't gay lawyers with AIDS, but we can slip ourselves into the mindset, because the movie makes it easy for us.  That, as much as anything, seems to have been the point.",

Unfortunately, an important file he is working on goes missing and his absent (and possible disorganization) causes him to endure instant termination right at the same time he diagnosed with AIDS. He believes that someone knew of his diagnosis and he builds a case, along with a competing lawyer (Denzel Washington), against his firm, even though his health deteriorates severely. Hanks and Washington shine in fine performances through this slow, though rewarding film. Quite sad and tragic and definitely doesn't get pretentious in displaying the equality between homosexual and heterosexuals (no over indulgence in physical affection between characters that is). The supporting cast, including Mary Steenburgen and Jason Robards, are quite good.

            "content": "Philidelphia has issues and doesn't seem to have the general focus in its story that I would have expected based on the film's promotion, but its incredibly well acted and is a truly compelling story, so it's an absolute success.\n\nPhilidelphia isn't a perfect film, because the pacing is fairly fast which doesn't give much time to stop and comprehend the realism of the drama, and so within a matter of minutes Andrew Beckett turns from a confident worker with a purple mark on his head into an unemployed victim of corporate cruelty as well as AIDS. \nAlso, despite AIDS being the key theme of the story, Philidelphia is more focused on Joe Miller dealing with his insecurities as a homophobic lawyer than explaining what Andrew Beckett goes through with AIDS. Although the intention here is clearly to reflect the cultural shift caused by the shock of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, it doesn't focus on the dramatic dynamics of someone forced to deal with the syndrome head-onn, and that causes the focus to deviate to a 2nd person social perspective. Although this is played off well, considering that Tom Hanks was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia, I assumed there would be significantly more focus on him. But his character, Andrew Beckett's role is practically reduced to being a supporting character rather than a lead one, and so if anything it's my opinion that the Academy acknowledge his role as a supporting character, especially considering that on the past many actors in lead roles have only received Best Supporting Actor nominations, such as River Phoenix for Running on Empty, Timothy Hutton for Ordinary People or Al Pacino for The Godfather, for which he boycotted the ceremony.\n\nNevertheless, Philadelphia succeeds as a film handling the cultural shift of the 1990's in terms of attitudes towards homosexuality and AIDS itself from the social perspective. It also puts complexities into the story so it's more than just a mere melodrama tugging at the heartstrings, it's also a complex courtroom drama with a good script and a fine soundtrack. Jonathan Demme's directional job is deserving of substantial praise. Mainly because he puts the actors in positions which define them, as in where they stand physically, and because he handles the AIDS cultural shift with gusto.\nSo is Tom Hanks' lead performance. Although his performance doesn't have the same amazement today it did in 1993, it still has the recognition of being one of the most acclaimed performances of a character dealing with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, as well as one of the earliest ones which explains its popularity. Tom Cruise depicts Andrew Beckett as human as possible, even with his AIDS experience, and particularly when he first reveals his condition to Joe Miller the way he casually states \"I have AIDS\" as he shakes the lawyer's hand it presents the fact that AIDS isn't the only thing you can look at the character for, because he is human too. That's what he reminds us of in Philadelphia, that he isn't characterised by AIDS, and the fact that everyone else characterises him by that reveals the controversial social standard of the day. Philadelphia presents the cultural shift of the approach to AIDS well, and Tom Hanks' performance does a great job conveying a character suffering from the disease and general outlook of it from the society. Also, the fact that Andrew Beckett is in fact a homosexual doesn't affect his character because since he isn't an overly flamboyant stereotype but more just a stoic character with his own sexuality, he just goes to show how a person isn't defined by their sexuality.\nDenzel Washington also portrays Joe Miller greatly since his specialty as an actor is to be portraying conflicted heroes, and in this case the conflict is homophobia which is a very controversial and disgusting subject, one so bad that Denzel Washington himself struggled to deal with playing a character of that manner. But it doesn't affect his performance, and his portrayal of a strong and confident lawyer as well as conflicted being who angrily makes use of the derogatory term \"faggot\" when faced with an uncomfortable situation is both convincingly multiple sided and confident, with fine line delivery and a sense of strength which he provides in support to the weaknesses of Andrew Beckett against adversity, and it provides a sense of security to the heroic side of the story.\nJason Robards also portrayed a corporate villain confidently, and Mary Steenburgen was terrific because she's known for portraying sweet and caring characters, and she plays this into her role as a lawyer who journeys into dark personal territory when interrogating Andrew Beckett to reduce his credibility, and yet her personality causes the audience to clash the themes and only see her not as a woman or a lawyer, but merely someone doing their job as best they can. \nLastly, Antonio Banderas is good to have in one of his early roles and he applies a character that generally seems good for Andrew Beckett's wellbeing, enhancing the story.\n\nSo Phildalphia handles the cultural shift of AIDS well in a successful manner, even though it doesn't look into the mind of a character facing it and generates more focus on everyone else's opinion of it.",

Tackling the issues of AIDS at a time when Hollywood shied away from the subject has earned it a place in film history and thankfully it is a worthy entry on its own terms as a film.\n\nLed by an Oscar winning performance by Tom Hanks, Philadelphia's strengths as a story are played to perfection by its cast. Hanks deservedly got his first Oscar for the role of Andrew Beckett, playing a man who is slowly dying yet fighting for what he believed was a wrongful termination from his law firm due to his illness. Heartfelt and genuine, Hanks makes Beckett's descent towards an undeniable death tragic, graceful and emotional. Never overplaying the normalcy of the man Beckett is regardless of how people view his sexuality, illness or social position Hanks has made a character for the ages. He's just a man who wants to live, and live a normal life regardless of who he is behind his front door.\n\nBacked up by Denzel Washington's lawyer, a homophobe who takes Beckett's case regardless of his personal feelings towards his client, Philadelphia has a leading duo who make a strong, iconic and important pair. Washington's Joe Miller may have views that the film is trying to show is wrong, but they also highlight how he fights for what is right, and how he learns to accept the man Beckett is. It's almost a middle ground which highlights to the viewer everything that is wrong with Beckett's old work colleagues. Those people are ignorant, you are truly meant to believe that they convinced themselves they hadn't fired Beckett because he had AIDS.\n\nWhilst the courtroom scenes at times are a little too preachy and blunt with the messages the script is making, the other scenes of Beckett and Miller's lives are played so elegantly and emotionally that you can't help but be totally captivated. The real emotion comes from the ordinary, real-life scenes and characters it portrays, and you can feel a connection to every one of them on some level.\n\nIt also struggles to really get under the skin of the other side of the story. We learn everything from Beckett and Miller's point of view, yet the script skips over the events as seen from the law firm and it's board of members. It's something that a lesser film shouldn't worry about, but seeing as Philadelphia has a serious message it wants to tell it's almost a little disrespectful to disregard the other side to such a degree.\n\nWhilst it may be true that the subject matter still has an even greater film within it, for the time it was ground breaking. It's handling of that subject matter is undeniably impressive as a result. Philadelphia is not just something that true fans of the film medium should see. It's a film that everyone should see, and then appreciate what it was trying to say at a time when it was taboo to say it.",

The only problem is: that's pretty much all it does. Sure, Tom Hanks gives one of his most inspired performances, but it's Denzel who we need to be paying attention to here and he really gets the short end of the stick. So much screen time is devoted to convincing the audience to empathize with Tom that we lose sight of Denzel's journey. We never really get to see (key word = see) Denzel grow from a two-bit personal injury litigator underdog into a civil rights courtroom powerhouse, or even shed his discriminatory views and learn that gay people aren't so bad after all (although, it is implied). So much screen time was wasted (ie. the first 25 minutes) on Tom that could have been much better spent on scenes of Tom and Denzel challenging each others opinions/ideologies and learning and growing from each other. All considered, the value of Philadelphia is mostly educational and partially its cultural heritage, but it shouldn't be owned or revered as good.",

Tom Hanks delivers his best performance to date, easily garnering our sympathy for his character. Denzel Washington gives a great performance as usual, accurately conveying how we would normally react in a situation like this. The direction is beautiful, with much praise towards the opera scene and the beginning scene capturing Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nHowever, this film is slightly messy when judged as a legal drama. Washington seemed to be preaching against homophobic discrimination rather than defending his client, as shown in his strange questioning and moments in the courtroom. His overall argument wasn't very compelling and was disjointed at some points. In addition, Hanks and Banderas didn't have great on screen chemistry. To me, Banderas seemed more of a brother or a friend than a lifetime partner. \r\n\r\nAside from its flaws, Philadelphia is an emotional drama and showcases excellent performances and direction.",

Unfortunately, this story was ripped off from a real victim who died only a few years earlier than this production, and the producers didn't ask for permission or give any ounce of credit to the man.

Lets face it, there are huge homophobes out there, I for one am not one of them, but in modern day they are gaining a lot more respect but this film shows how back then they still were looked upon as different and creepy which is still how some view them now.  As for AIDS, when the film was released we were only just learning about this disease and this movie shows how people were scared and would do anything to stay away from it, but it also shows the seriousness of it.  These issues are brought into a courtroom drama with wonderful character, incredible performances, and an amazing screenplay.  I loved the way the story was able to confront the issues head on and not shy away from how some people view homosexuals and people with AIDS, its a very intense drama.  The character of Andrew Beckett is genius, he is complex with his love for law and his sexual orientation an is a great reminder that a man is a man no matter what disease he has or how he chooses to live life.  Joe Miller is very important, he represents prejudice and how men seem to judge just by how they live their lives, but Beckett shows him not all different people are bad.  I have to admit that even I am not a huge supporter or against gay rights, I just believe a man should live his life no matter what and I think that is what the film is trying to get across, they don't want special treatment, they want equality.  Tom Hanks was perfection, he deserved more than an Oscar here for his outstanding and incredible performance and this is one of the best roles of his career.  Denzel Washington was amazing, he was charismatic and just starting to rise into fame at this time and this movie is just another example of his great career.  When I watched Philadelphia I did not know what I was going to see, but it turns out I watched a movie that was brave enough to take chances and show the world a different point of view we never see.

When the homosexual Beckett suddenly contracts AIDS he is fired unfairly fired from his workplace. Beckett then seeks the help of a small time homophobic lawyer, Joe Miller (Washington), to establish a wrongful dismissal case. Now from initial premise and the fact that I had heard Tom Hanks earned a Best Actor Oscar for his performance, I was expecting a fairly memorable movie. And I got one. Tom Hanks delivers one of his best and most moving performances with his portrayal of Beckett. Probably one of the most dynamic roles I've ever seen Hanks take on. He starts out as such a vibrant young man, yet as the film progresses, Beckett's illness does as well. Consequently, the audience witnesses the decline of a seemingly healthy man to a man who's body has been ravaged by an incurable disease. It's really quite heartbreaking. Tom Hanks worked well for this Oscar. Along side Hanks is Washington, who also gives a fine performance as the conflicted lawyer Miller. Like Beckett, Miller goes through a significant change as well - only his soul changes, not his health. It's really quite interesting to see Washington and Hanks work together on screen, as I've never seen it happen in any other film. The film also features a very well written script and a very nice direction from Jonathon Demme. The ending of this film is really quite something, and. . .yeah, I'll say it - the conclusion of this film was really intense for me to watch. Pretty emotional stuff. Overall I felt that \"Philadelphia\" is a poignant tale that succeeds in addressing many issues that have often been neglected in our time. I felt that it was filled to the brim with fine performances and palpable pathos. It's a great movie that I won't soon forget. Awesome.",

            "content": "Jonathan Demme's \"Philadelphia\" throws us into a world of pain and stark truth that is few and far between in mainstream cinema. The sheer idea that a film would so blatantly take on the difficulty of AIDS and homosexuality, helmed by the director of \"Silence of the Lambs\", the actor in \"Big\" and the guy who played Malcom X, is staggering. \n\nAIDS is a reality and homophobia is a nasty truth that permeates our \"United\" States of America, as well as the rest of the world. At the time that this film was released (about 1993), the U.S. found solace in the idea that AIDS and homosexuality were dirty brothers in a distant family. By placing the film in the \"City of Brotherly Love\", hiring Bruce Springsteen to sing the title song and having an up-and-coming Tom Hanks star, director Jonathan Demme wisely readied an ignorant America for our first, uninhibited glance into the face of AIDS. \n\nTom Hanks embodied his role in an Oscar-worthy performance, allowing us to watch as his lovely and lively Andrew Beckett deteriorate before our eyes. Tom Hanks and the writers took to task the difficult and annoyingly controversial hurdle of playing the \"gay\" character and placing the \"straight\" audience into that different world. Stereotypes are mostly shied away from in the script with a few \"fem\" gays and drag queens. These scenes are few, but are also a reality. Many a Christmas party have I attended with the same crowd (\"fems\" and drag queens) in the mix. The other, mildly annoying, factor in this film is that the writers inform us that squeaky-clean gay Andrew Beckett contracts AIDS at a porn theater from an anonymous stranger, while in a committed relationship. This annoyed me because I wanted a righteous victim, not a impure victim. Yet as time has gone by and I have had the opportunity to work with many a victim of AIDS, whether be it male or female, gay or straight, I have seen that this too is an unfortunate reality. No one is perfect (gay or straight, male or female) and mistakes are often made. Costly mistakes are often made. This was a painful truth, but it is a truth nonetheless. In this, Tom Hanks as Mr. Beckett, brilliantly gave AIDS an honest face for a distant America. \n\nDenzel Washington, on the other hand, allowed America to have a relatable character, one whose shoes we've fit in before. Denzel's views of homosexuality were (and still are) commonplace in the American psyche and his reactions to AIDS were understandable to the average audience. Yet all in all this dramatic film brought a message home. \n\nDemme's directing style is nothing amazing; he tastefully weaves a tale without flashy shots or fancy cuts. At times the film borders on preachy, but, as always, it is Demme's story that grasps the audience, his mood that sets us into the tale, his actors and his direction of them that gives the film honesty. This film is highly recommended if not for the great acting but for lovers of a great story.",

AIDS is a reality and homophobia is a nasty truth that diffused \"United\" States of America, as well as the rest of the world. At the time that this film was released (about 1993), the U.S. found comfort in the idea that AIDS and homosexuality were dirty brothers in a distant family. By placing the film in the \"City of Brotherly Love\", hiring Bruce Springsteen to sing the title song and having an upcoming Tom Hanks star, director Jonathan Demme [Director Of ''Silence Of The Lambs''] wisely readied an ignorant America for first, uninhibited glance into the face of AIDS.\n\nTom Hanks' performance was obviously worthy of his first Oscar for his portrayal of Andrew Beckett, a gay, AIDS-stricken man who was fired from his job for what he believes to be discrimination against his sexual orientation and disease. Denzel Washington, in his portrayal of Joe Miller, the ex-homophobic who decides to help Andrew win his case, is excellent, deserving of a Best Supporting Actor award. This story of AIDS, homophobia and homosexualism is first-rate.\n\nAs I Told You early, Tom Hanks was fantastic, as usual. Denzel was also rock solid, his character basically representing all of us, the general public, the ones who don't empathize with gays because they either don't know any, or aren't conscious they know any, and fail to appreciate that they are real people and not merely stereotypes. His enlightenment with regards to this is one aspect of the movie I felt they came through on exceptionally. \n\nAs about the Hindi Remake of Shilpa-Salman-Abhishek starrer 'Phir Milenge\", The movie dealt wid the similar plot, But After seeing ''Philadelphia'' , i was little disappointed with this film. I tried hard to like it, but could'nt help feeling bored in parts and had to cringe at some of the drawn-out melodramatic bits. It was somewhat predictable.At the least, all i can say the Director of ''Phir Milenge'' Revathy she made good attempt on this movie.The best aspect of this film [Phir Milenge]was that the Aids issue was finally raised in India in a way that should come through to mass audiences. The film hammered the message that the fear of catching Aids simply by being near a sufferer is unfounded, and hopefully, will contribute to stopping discrimination in the CONSERVATIVE & STEREOTYPE community.\n\nSo, Finally m giving \"PHILADELPHIA\" 4 on 5.......It's a touching and groundbreaking courtroom and human drama..Watch it If u Missed or looking for a Great Movie !!",

Based on a true story, Andrew (Tom Hanks) is a high level employee in the most prestigious law firm in Philadelphia who is fired after his co-workers become suspicious that he might be both gay, as well as infected with AIDS. Through Andrew's struggles, this film focuses on society fears and misconceptions relating to AIDS and homophobia. Philadelphia is a ground breaking movie that covers topics that were previously taboo to discuss.  This is a sad movie not only in seeing how people who are lesbian or gay or people with AIDS are treated, but also in watching the process of someone with AIDS die.",

            "content": "Philadelphia is the first Hollywood film to acknowledge the danger and consequences of AIDS, but also the ignorance that many people become susceptible to because they don't understand this pandemic.  Tom Hanks won the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and a Silver Bear for Best Actor, and lost weight for the role of Andrew Beckett in the film, conveying a realistic portrayal of those with AIDS.\r\n\r\nRock Hudson, a beloved and accomplished romantic actor of the 50's and 60's was one of the first Hollywood actors to die of AIDS, and his diagnosis occurred at the same time as the revelation of AIDS itself. Hudson closeted his sexuality, and it is debatable how this could have affected his roles in his melodramas, particularly the way he acted towards women. Hiding sexuality is a big theme in Philadelphia, and the narrative itself does a very good job of that.\r\n\r\nAndrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is a young attorney in a law firm; his sexuality is never apparent, Demme avoids shots of a sexual nature with Beckett's boyfriend Miguel (Antonio Banderas), but this can also be due to constrained content regulations of the time. Beckett receives a promotion, but is soon fired due to the loss of some important paperwork, which is not the real excuse, and the audience presume as well as Beckett that he was fired because of his AIDS. The audience are never informed that Beckett has AIDS, we only become aware over time and his physical appearance. Lesions appear on Beckett's face - the make-up is beyond stunning, and this is the beginning test of the audience's loyalty to Hanks' character. Beckett seeks a lawyer to help him in suing the company, however none comply, and he is rejected by Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), a homophobe who reacts by backing away from Beckett.\r\n\r\nThe responses by Washington's character when he discovers Beckett's condition angered me personally; he brushes off his suit jacket and consults a doctor about catching it through skin-to-skin contact. Beckett's boss Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards) covers up his dismissal of Beckett as \"incompetence\", however in another scene says to fellow employers that Beckett \"brought AIDS into our office\". The audience are encouraged to explore the various viewpoints of all the characters in the film, and Beckett's mother (Joanne Woodward) significantly stood out as a supportive parent of her dying son, which was just heart-warming.\r\n\r\nThe distance between Beckett and Miller is a factor that emphasises Miller's development of character; as Miller's homophobia subsides and he offers to help Beckett we see the two men sitting opposite each other, and eventually side by side in the court room, until the very emotional ending scene as Miller puts Beckett's oxygen mask on for him. Some audiences may feel the same as Miller, and for some the relationship being portrayed can be uncomfortable, but the camera technique used to make the character talk directly to the audience may make those who are prejudice reassess their attitudes, particularly in a contemporary culture. The script by Ron Nyswaner can be complicated, as it jumps ahead months and then weeks with flashbacks integrated, and at some points the audience might feel they have lost track of how badly Beckett's condition has decreased.\r\n\r\nThe court case is extraordinary as two passionate lawyers fight their cases, Miller on Beckett's side and Belinda Conine (Mary Steenburgen) supporting the law firm. Conine intrudes into Beckett's privacy, asking uncomfortable questions the audience would not expect and not caring for the reaction the court receive, making the court scenes strained, until Beckett's condition tragically causes him fall to the floor. Miller's speech in court on homosexuals, loathing and fear is a triumphant one and he really connects with audience in his determination to fight Beckett's case until the end, even without his presence.\r\n\r\nThe opera scene starring Maria Callas' \"La Momma Morta\" is a powerful and distressing depiction of the acceptance of death and enjoyment of living in the moment. The scene captures Beckett moving around the room bathed in a red light, explaining the song to an opera-hating Miller, who undergoes his last conversion not only in his opinion of homosexuality, but a conversion of heart overall. The scene is so intense it is arguable that it could be an overkill to the film, but the soundtrack provides an emotional elevation for the audience until the very end, with Neil Young's beautiful piece \"Philadelphia\", in which the lyrics are \"Philadelphia, city of brotherly love\", which brought me to tears. The ending is touching, as Beckett's loved ones say they will \"see him tomorrow\" and we watch Miller place the oxygen mask on a very vulnerable Beckett. The lack of funeral is a dissimilar way to end the film, but instead it is replaced by a range of home footage material of Beckett as a young boy. On reflection, this illustrates that Andrew Beckett is just another human being, and Philadelphia has successfully addressed one of the most important concerns of our time, Hanks giving a convincing and gifted performance before Forrest Gump (1994), Saving Private Ryan (1998) and The Green Mile (1999).",

            "content": "The courtroom drama Philadelphia is directed by Jonathan Demme and stars Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, and Antonio Banderas. The film takes place in modern day Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\tThe film starts off with Andrew Beckett (Hanks) and Joe Miller (Washington) working together in some sort of law meeting, they do not know each other before this and are for some reason in a meeting together. Beckett works for a big law firm and is promoted to become a senior partner, but at the meeting where he is congratulated one of the partners of the law firm notices a mark on his forehead. The film then cuts to I believe a month later where it is revealed that Beckett has been fired and is requesting Miller, a fellow lawyer, to help him sue the law firm that he worked at because he believed that he was fired due to the fact that he was a homosexual and had AIDS. Miller says that Beckett does not have a case due to the fact that he does not have enough information to make that conclusion. After some time it shows how Miller has a daughter and then the two men are at the public library. Miller at first hides from Beckett but then sympathizes for him because a librarian is asking him to go to the private section due to his illness. That is when Miller offers his services to Beckett and the highly emotional film starts to get the wheels turning.\r\n\r\n\tThe screenplay for this film was highly moving. The characters had much depth to them and I understood how each the leads were feeling. I could feel how Beckett was not only suffering from his terrible illness, but from the people around him who thought he was disgusting and unnatural. Yet I also understood the reasons to why Miller disliked homosexuals and his reasoning for that dislike, but I respected him greatly for putting his personal beliefs to the side and doing what the law says to be correct. The film has some great comedic moments along with its memorable emotional moments. The only problem was that it was somewhat predictable, but that really did not make the journey the film brought me on less enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\tThe direction by Jonathan Demme was very good for this film. The shots in general were really nothing special, but they got the job done, he succeeded greatly in bringing so much emotion into this film. He has proven that he can get amazing performances out of his actors and has gotten three of the actors he had worked with Oscars. It was not as well directed as The Silence of the Lambs, but still with these two back to back great films one would think he would have a much more successful career.\r\n\r\n\tThe acting in this film was phenomenal. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar he received for his performance as Andrew Beckett and this performance is one of the many reasons why he is considered one of the greatest actors. He was just a purely lovable character and I felt so deeply for him. Bravo, Mr. Hanks, too bad you haven't acted this well since Cast Away. Denzel Washington was absolutely fantastic as Joe Miller. He is the most relatable character and was great in every aspect. His performance not getting nominated for an Oscar is another of the greatest snubs in history, yet I do not feel as bad for him since he did end up earning two Oscars so far in his career. Antonio Banderas has a minor role of playing Andrew Beckett's partner and plays it to the best the role can be played. Wonderful performances all around.\r\n\r\n\tThe score for this film was as well brilliant. It added all the emotion whether it be light hearted or heart breaking. The song by Bruce Springsteen won an Oscar as it should have and the whole into score is exactly how such an emotional picture should be done. \r\n\r\n\tOverall I give this film a strong 8/10 because it is very good in every aspect. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas or films that are about social problems that are faced in the world.",

His demonstration that those who might be unfamiliar, are nevertheless human and possess worth is touching without being over the top. \n\n I have a few qualms with the film. Their use of TV sitcom style cuts are a little out of place. There are a handful of shots that attempt to portray the scene from Beckett's point of view. The people in the shot are blurry, and you feel almost as if you are lightheaded. This attempt to align the audience with Beckett, is an interesting technique. However, it doesn't flow well. Sometimes it seems to come out of nowhere, and isn't tied in with the rest of the film's tone. Also, the opera scene in Beckett's apartment was very emotional. While I understood the meaning behind it, and it was very well done.. it simply does not fit in with the rest of the film's tone. The worth of the film is inflated through controversy. Yes, the film is a tearjerker. Yes, it is engaging. However, some of the courtroom scenes were flat.. and the introduction and side story (mainly Joe Miller overcoming his homophobia) could have been done better.",

Without underestimating dramatic lighting, a stoic and grounded counterpart, and opera with a built-in physiological reaction, this scene is the reason Hanks makes the list. \r\n\r\nMartyrs are so often un-relatable, and at the time the movie was released, this discordant character was in danger of waffling to a bad cliche. But Hanks portrays a paradoxical personal strength and physical weakness that bursts through the bullshit screen tactics that would smother most actors. \r\n\r\nHe manages to create an absolutely and beautifully flawed human character despite most of the movie working against that, and his raw, painful exposure leaves the audience in a vicarious, bitter-sweet grief. I cannot think of another actor who could have so immediately and completely drawn in a wary audience... something crucial to the touchy material. Hanks is that spoonful of sugar to an otherwise medicinal character.  It's a wholly engrossing performance to watch and one of the few that makes me forget I'm not in the room with him.",

As a courtroom drama the script is filled with cliches and the Washington character is arranged to acquiesce toward homosexuality. Demme deserves credit though for effectively using close-ups to show the physical deterioration of AIDS victims.

The movie is an inspirational film and quite a brave step for Demme considering the release of this movie was back when we(America) got out of the Reagan/Bush era and into the Clinton era. This was the perfect time for Philadelphia to be released and because it definitely had a point to prove and that is that gay people are just like normal people. They're no different than any of us. And as the movie progresses, it challenges your morals of right and wrong. Which I, honestly feel is a good thing when a movie makes you think and question things. \r\n\r\nThe camera angles in this movie were brilliant. There were angles that gave you a first person view and lets you see through the eyes of Beckett as he struggles with AIDS. There was also an angle where you get to see straight into Beckett's face as he's talking about the opera music. Though this scene was good, they ruined the emotion of this by focusing on him too long and just making you lose connection to the movie. \r\n\r\nThe acting in this movie was amazing. Tom Hanks, time and time again proves that no matter if this were his first film or last film, he can consistently pump out an amazing performance. Hanks' role as a gay lawyer who has been shafted by his law firm due to his sexual orientation and disability AIDS, is sincere as ever. Denzel Washington definitely shined through in this film. Washington's performance gives you a first hand feel for his confusion and all the weight on his shoulders and how he's trying to cope to the idea of Gay people in general.\r\n\r\nThe flaws in this movie is that there were a good amount of scenes that I felt were just fillers. I also felt that though it is a deep film, it can get a bit preachy and was cramming ideas into your mind. The biggest part for me was the ending. The ending was kind of anti climatic and seemed like it lacked the drive to truly make you feel remorseful for Beckett's death.\r\n\r\nOverall, This movie was daring for it's time and even years and years later, it's still pushing the envelope. The movie is boasted by Washington and Hanks' performance. The movie has it's heart in the right place but falls short and should take into consideration that sometimes less is more. But This is still a good movie and I salute Demme for taking this leap of faith and I suggest this movie to the open minded!!!",

            "content": "What intrigued me the most to see this was hearing that Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks were in the same movie. I also liked how Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young were both nominated for The Academy Award for Best Song. Neil Young is a fellow Canadian and I love that guy, however you can't beat The Boss, and \"Streets of Philidelphia\" is a very moving song and powerful song. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of moving and powerful, I am going to get to thie movie now. Tom Hanks plays the role of a very sucessful lawyer for a big shot firm. He gets recently promoted and is very excited and happy. There are to things he has not mentioned to  anyone at his firm, \r\n\r\n1. He is a Homosexual \r\n\r\n2. He is dying of the AIDS virus. \r\n\r\nHis superior's or the boss's at this firm are very old fashioned people, because well they are old themselves. Tom Hanks character develops a skin lesion on his forhead which is obviously noticable but when asked what it is, he states he was hit in the head with a tennis ball. One of his boss's knows exactly what it is because he has seen it before. Before you know it he is out of a job, the once top lawyer at his firm has suddenly been framed for being irresponsible and thus gives his superiors an excuse to can him.\r\n\r\nEnter Denzel Washington,\r\n\r\nHe is also a lawyer and has been challenged by Tom Hanks before in the courtroom in the past. When Tom Hanks approaches him (after approaching 9 other lawyers that turned him down) to sue for wrongful dismissal he turns him down as well at first but then comes to his senses and puts his homophobia aside. This begining a very very emotional journey for himself and Tom Hanks. The movie is very good and you need to see it. The message is very powerful and hits society with the cold palm of reality, much like Schindlers List did, which was also released the same year...but who are we kidding it is no Schindler's List, However Tom Hanks snapped up his first Oscar for Best Actor with this film then followed it up the next year for Forrest Gump.",

I would also like to highlight Jason Robard and Mary Steenburgen's performances, as well as Antonio Banderas.  This film means more to me than the average court drama.  It shoves a mirror in our faces, saying that gays are like everyone else, and they shouldn't be frowned upon.  What a powerful film.  One of the best of 1993.",

Un film necessario, impegnatissimo. Non solo un film sull'AIDS e sull'omosessualitÃ , ma un film sulla societÃ  attuale, sulle discriminazioni ignobili, la cattiveria umana, la stupiditÃ  e il non rispetto del diritto alla vita. \n\nUmiliazione, ingiustizia, rabbia (repressa): tutto ciÃ² Ã¨ costretto a subirlo Andrew Beckett, giovane avvocato che viene licenziato dai suoi datori di lavoro quando questi scoprono che non solo Ã¨ omosessuale ma Ã¨ anche contratto l'AIDS. All'inizio si rivolge a Joe Miller, brillante e famoso avvocato, affinchÃ¨ lo difenda, ma vedendosi chiusa per l'ennesima volta la porta in faccia decide di farsi giustizia da solo. Almeno finchÃ¨ Joe, eliminati provvisoriamente i suoi pregiudizi, non decide di assumersi l'incarico di difenderlo in tribunale...\n\nJonathan Demme, dopo \"Il Silenzio degli Innocenti\", si riconferma come un autore capace di centrare sempre il suo argomento: e lo fa con una tecnica raffinata, con movimenti di macchina azzeccatissimi e soggettive sempre interessanti, nonchÃ¨ con primi piani fondamentali ed esplicativi. Come non citare poi i due attori, un Tom Hanks vincitore di un premio Oscar quanto mai giustissimo, un attore capace di essere quello che vuole in ogni film con una credibilitÃ  sconvolgente; Denzel Washington fa il suo lavoro in modo impeccabile e altamente verosimile, e il suo personaggio ha un'evoluzione non indifferente nel corso del film... Dopotutto, si nota perfettamente che per quella causa, alla fine, dopo i pregiudizi, la cattiveria, la stupiditÃ , avrebbe fatto qualunque cosa. Ed Ã¨ per questo, che alla fine, Ã¨ impossibile non far cadere almeno qualche lacrima..",

That really is quite a thrill when that happens.\"\n\nWhen you cry and feel true emotion at the end of a film that is meant to make you do, just that...Then you know it's good. \"Philadelphia\" is a masterpiece in film making and one of the best films I've ever seen. And of course when you have Amazing actors such as: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington and Antonio Banderas...it's hard to go wrong! Amazing acting, directing and story...This film is an inspiration and a true example of justice being served. Very entertaining!",

            "content": "Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) is a talented young attorney at a prestigious Philadelphia law office who is successful, easy-going, and secretly gay; something he kept from his employers. His record is top class and he's been assigned the most prestigious case in the company's history. However, when he becomes afflicted by AIDS his bosses fire him on grounds of incompetency, when a report he made, mysteriously disappears from both his desk and computer hard drive. He however suspects that they have fired him due to their discovery of his sexuality and his illness and tries to hire a lawyer to take his case and sue the firm for unfair dismissal and lost earnings, but nobody will take an AIDS patient as a client.\r\nHe ends up approaching Joe Miller (Denzel Washington) to represent him but Joe has a few issues of his own with gay people and steadfastly refuses. Andrew persists, and gradually Joe comes to grips with Andrew's worth and dignity as a human being. The thought of a homosexual white man with AID's hiring a homophobic African American man as a lawyer was brilliant. The courtroom provided Washington the stage to make his case against fear, hatred and discrimination of those 'different' from us in this \"touchy\" topic.\r\nI thought the script was well written and the interaction between the characters was the most honest I have ever seen in a movie. Overall, a controversial but touching, emotional, funny, and honest movie with both Washington and Hanks giving superb performances! Highly recommended.",
