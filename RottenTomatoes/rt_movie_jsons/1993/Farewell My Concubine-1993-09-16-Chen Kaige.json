The scope is vast and like the film To Live, it can't really do justice to the enormous events within Chinese society over the fifty or so years in question. There are some brilliant aspects to the film including the female lead who really stood out and owned her scenes. However, it does grow tired in places and Chinese opera is painful to listen to. Decent but not as good as other Chinese classics of the era in my opinion.",

The affection between Cheung's Douzi and Fengyi's Shitou just doesn't feel convincing enough to carry a film of this kind of ambition; when crises occur and betrayals take place, they seldom carry much in the way of weight (or consequences), robbing the audience of direct involvement. Instead, the film's plot comes off much more melodramatic than it should, becoming more of a checklist of 20th-century Chinese history told through a love triangle and catty dialogue than a deeply affecting drama, despite strong performances from the leads.\n\nStill, it remains ambitious and took genuinely daring leaps with both its incorporation of homosexuality into traditionally conservative Chinese society, and its gruesome depiction of the Cultural Revolution, and deserves credit for each. Plus, it does look pretty darn good. (3/5)",

He showed a heartbreaking and pathetic performance. He had had physical and psychological abuse through the academy of Beijing's opera since he was young in the movie's story, this shows that not only Leslie Cheung but also the child actor also improved the film's perfection. Because child actors also showed good performance. it was also great to express the emotions between each character through cinematic props. One prop expresses the situation in the characters' childhood, and the conflict between the characters in China's changing times as they grow physically and psychologically. Surprisingly, it makes the characters in the movie seem to be real historical figures.",

It is a beautifully shot, sweeping epic with magnetic performances from Leslie Chung, Zhang Fengyi and Gong Li. Unfortunately, it's strengths are also its weakness. While the scenes of the Beijing Opera are spectacular and the relationships between the leads engaging, the film has bitten off a bit more than it can chew. Set over a period of almost half a century, there is just too much ground to cover, even with a generous runtime. The extensive time period covered is further complicated by the fact that the 20th century was such a complex time in Chinese history, with ever shifting political and social changes. As a result, for those who are not already familiar with early 20th century China, much of the film becomes muddled as it jumps from decade to decade. Even for those who are familiar with the underlying context can at times experience a bit of whiplash as the film jumps forward in leaps and bounds, drawing out the small intimate moments and jumping over big events that would set the stage for the film's commentary. It is in these small moments that Farewell My Concubine cements itself as a spectacular work, worthy of every ounce of praise it has recieved. Unfortunately, it seems a little to he'll bent on leaving nothing out, which means the emotional core of the film gets buried under thw burocratic nonsense.",

            "content": "An intriguing tale, with a fascinating chunk of modern Chinese history serving as the background. Spanning over 50 years, the film tells about the ups and downs of a traditional Peking Opera troupe, and its two stars, from 1924 to 1977. Not only do we see the various political events of the time, but also how the traditional opera and its stars are treated during different eras.\n\nThe two stars, Dieyi and Xiaolou, are brought up and trained to play specific roles - that of concubine and king respectively - in a famous play. Dieyi (Douzi) is trained, or should I say, forced to behave, sing, move and dance like a girl, from a very young age. The two of them share a unique and close bond, and this balance gets affected when a woman, Juxian, enters the picture. Their political naivet\u00e9 get them into many problems, but it's their properly unresolved love triangle that causes more trouble.\n\nThe lines between fact and fiction are blurred when we realise the similarities between the play and their actual lives. Dieyi's devotion to opera and Xiaolou are as strong as the concubine's devotion to the king. (The lines are blurred even more when Leslie Cheung, bisexual himself, takes his life in 2003) The end is inevitable, as we realise while the story progresses, but it's reached with proper momentum and after an intriguing chain of events.\n\nThe acting by the three leads is really terrific. Leslie Cheung as the female-role playing opera star who's completely devoted to his art, Fengyi Zhang as a talented and playful man who can easily separate his private and work lives, and Gong Li as the prostitute-turned-wife whose shades of determination and compassion keeps us from not having a fixed view of her character. With Chen Kaige's talented direction and Gu Changwei's spectacular cinematography, the movie has many colourful and memorable scenes.\n\nI really liked the movie, and wasn't bored for a single second. The movie deals with so many interesting themes - Modern Chinese history, sexuality, art and its reception, devotion and passion - but yet it somehow makes me feel that it had the potential to be much more compelling. Other than the political events, the characters could have been explored a little more.",

Leslie Cheung's performance in the film is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie, his own persona shines throughout the film, portraying a characters that is resilient but at the same time vulnerable.

It spans throught 5 decades of chinese history, and follows one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen. It's costumes are spectacular and the cinematography is brilliant. What makes this one of the greatest movies ever made is the acting. For me, there were no actors in this movie, only the characters. It is a class of acting that you seldom see in Western cinema. If you won't watch the film on the heart-wrenching story alone, then watch it for one of the greatest performances of all time by Leslie Cheung. \n\nThis is the story of two men, Douzi (Leslie Cheung) and Shitou (Fengyi Zhang), who met as apprentices in the Peking Opera, and remained in contact for over 50 years. Both of them grew up to star in the opera 'Farewell My Concubine,' where Douzi played the Concubine and Shitou played the King of Chu.\n\nOver the years we see the era of the Warlords (1920s), the Japanese invasion (mid 1940s), the retaking of China by the nationalists (late 1940s), and then the communist era of Mao Zedong. This epic story spans all the way to 1977, and not once does the excitement or attachment to the story falter.\n \nLeslie Cheung truly embodied this character and brought it to life. It was all in his eyes, every emotion that you could imagine. The anger, frustration, terror, love, and heartbreak all came across plainly on his face. There hasn't been a performance that moved me this much in a long time. From losing the man he loves to overcoming an opium addiction, every single movement, word, and expression was perfect.\n \nLi Gong also gave a breathtaking performance as a former prostitute and the wife of Shitou. Honestly, there is nothing this woman can't do. She's able to display such strength, and such fragility, all wrapped up into one character. Together, Gong and Cheung have brilliant chemistry as two 'women' who want the same man. \n\nThere is plenty of brutality in this film, mixed with plenty of tenderness. It's not completely tragic, for there is a lot of hope in these characters. You cannot describe this film with a genre or a word. It's more than a period drama, or a romance, or a tragedy.\n \nThese characters are interesting enough from a psychological perspective alone. If there's one thing I love Farewell My Concubine, it's that it begs you to discuss it afterwards. It leaves you to connect the dots when it comes to motives, feelings, and symbolism.\n \nI was thrilled from start to finish with this masterful film. It truly is one of the greatest movies ever made. Schindler's List may have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards during the same year, but for me this is a film worthy of that title. There's nothing I could fault about Farewell My Concubine. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in history and psychology.",
