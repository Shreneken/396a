    "summary": "During the 1930s, James Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) serves as a proper English butler to the doltish Lord Darlington (James Fox). Stevens is so dedicated that he forgoes visiting his father on his deathbed in order to serve, and overlooks Darlington's Nazi sympathies and growing anti-Semitism. Twenty years after his employer's death, Stevens tries to reconnect with Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), Darlington's head housekeeper, and begins to regret his loyalty to his former master.",

            "content": "I personally didn't enjoy the movie and none of my friends in the movie theather did. I felt like I was the same man before and after the movie and I just spent 2 hours in a neutral way. Although it had great acting and was very beautiful in the outside, in the inside it was empty as hell. \n\nIt was neither a movie about lossing loyalty to the lord because he was a nazi sympathizer nor a romance. It was a little bit of both and at the end a little bit of nothing. \n\nIt didn't go deep to the nazi stuff and at the end we were just told that the lord changed his mind about nazis, wow, he didn't show the charachters in during any special event, like idk, the declaration of war from Uk to Germany? The bombing of London? The D-Day? The Fall of Berlin? Like in this places there might have been some charachter development. Like that part of the story can be summed up to \"i like nazis - nazis do bad stuff - i hate nazis\" like ww2 can have so many things to do with the story and we just saw until the invasion of chechoslovakia and after the end of the war. \n\nIn the romance side of the story there was none, they were arguing the whole time and like the one scene that was supposed to be romantic, the book scene, was unromantic, awkard and embarassing af. There was no love built. And they were expecting us to feel sad at the end for that?\n\nThe butler was empty as hell, it was expected, because he is a butler and he is supposed to follow orders, but damn he was just there. He was just a tool to show what is happening around him without him taking part in almost everything. And I know you are heartless, but you dad died, that is so unrelatable.  When there were places where he could show or build charachter he was like \"i am a robot, i am following orders, 10111011\"\n\nThe movie almost felt that it was unfinished, like I watched the 2/3 of it. There were no real moral conclusion to any of the charachters except maybe the house keeper: \nThe Lord just regretted his support to nazi germany because nazis = bad. It's like a criminal sentenced to death row that regretted everything not because he understood what he did was wrong but because he is getting the death penalty. The butler didn't even recognised at the end that his loyalty to the lord was wrong. He had no moral compass and charachter to begin with thus can't get anywhere with that.\nThe House Keeper had a conclusion, sort of, but it involved the romance with a blunt man that we couldn't really care about because it wasn't really built and i am not quite sure if the butler ever shown a real interest. For real, I can't remember an instance that it was obvivous in love with her or something. \n\nIt felt that all the three main charachters like me in a way, left the movie the same, unchanged, like nothing happened, cause nothing really happened in the movie to be honest, really, it's a 2,5/10 very bad movie to pretty bad movie",

The pride he takes in his service is admirable and impressive but his other qualities do turn out to be flaws that leave him with what amounts to an emotional disability. The story has a frame from the 1950s from which it looks back to the 1920s and 1930s which makes it doubly a period film with glorious settings and costumes that make the times vivid. This is a Merchant and Ivory masterpiece with tasteful sets, brilliant acting, and a luminous script and story.",

I always enjoy watching old films, but I think this is one of the oldest films I've seen. It's originally a novel, that explained why the film was so lengthy. The film lasted two hours and fourteen minutes. Weirdly enough, I think it's one of the most interesting and educated films I've ever watched. I'll explain you why.\n \nIt's a film that takes place just before the Second World War. We see the perspective of a butler called Mr. Stevens. He works for a certain Lord Darlington. When I think of a film during the war, we see soldiers, families, concentration camps, etc. This film turned it all the way around.\nI liked the idea of giving the people this perspective. The mansion they used for the film was a really good choice. It had a good adaptation in that era.\n \nWe see lord Darlington slowly being under influence of the Nazis. He began to read books about how terrible Jews are. It was very realistic.\nA lot of people think that in that period of time people directly were on board with Hilter's incredible crazy ideas. But it didn't go like that.\n \nThere were different types of people during WWII: Some of them were simply influenced, like lord Darilngton, who fired two Jewish maids. Some of them disagreed, but just didn't give their opinion, like Mr. Stevens, who heard every conversation of the politicians but did nothing. And some of them disagreed and didn't let it slide, like Miss Kenton (later in the story Mrs. Benn). Mrs. Benn was one of my favourite characters in the film.\nThe kiss scenes were really fake, funny and dramatic at the same time. That amused me, but I actually didn't expect it to be this bad.\nThe crying scenes were hilarious. I realized that the acting skills in the 70s aren't the same as now.\n \nIt had good actors; some have performed better than others, but it was fine. It really opened my eyes on how people coped with the Nazi influence and without it. Sadly enough the end was extremely terrible. I really expected much more in the end, but it wasn't that at all. That really sucked.\nI would recommend this film to someone who's interested in history and who likes old films.\nCheers to The remains of the day for a trip in WWII in a different perspective.",

            "content": "James Ivory's \"The Remains of the Day\" is an ambitious, poignant and thoughtful period piece that offers a fresh interpretation of Kazuo Ishiguro's legendary novel. With his seventeenth feature, director James Ivory crafted an astonishing adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's classic novel that holds up today as a Merchant-Ivory classic. Using captivating cinematography, Ivory draws viewers into the world of a regretful butler that dedicates his life to the loyal Darlington Hall. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's post-war setting. The production sets, costumes and musical score are all carefully chosen, combining to create an immersive cinematic experience. It is hard to not marvel at the magnificent performances from the cast. Anthony Hopkins delivers one of the best performances of his career as James Stevens. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the disillusionment, longing and repressed feelings of an English butler that reflects on his life-long service. Emma Thompson is equally excellent in the role of a grieving housekeeper with unrequited feelings for the butler. Although \"The Remains of the Day\" is undeniably an unforgettable period piece, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At over two hours, it suffers from a lengthy running-time that tests the viewer's patience. Unlike modern movies, it's a slow-paced affair that takes its time to unfold. Nevertheless, fans of Merchant-Ivory productions will definitely enjoy \"The Remains of the Day\" and so will movie-goers seeking old-fashioned entertainment. At a time when modern audiences have never heard of Merchant-Ivory, it's a stirring reminder that their contemporary 20th Century stories are worth retelling on the big-screen.",

            "content": "\"Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.\"\n\nSeeing the general premise of The Remains of the Day, I was expecting a sort of precursor to Downton Abbey - a generally melodramatic look at the misdeeds of an aristocratic household. What I wasn't expecting was this sublime take on desperation, purpose, and romance delivered with such a balance between overt power and nuance. Hopkins is the portrait of repressed emotion, both with respect to anger and to passion, believing resolutely that his preservation of social norms and his particular role translate directly to his value as a person, only to find himself realizing all too late the error of his ways despite the efforts of the willful Kenton (Thompson). Their torrid, unconsummated affair is told through a thick veil of pretense and custom that they both clearly yearn to break through, but are ultimately unwilling to do so. Framing the shortcomings of the aristocratic class through a character with literal Nazi sympathies may be somewhat overt, but it is at leas convincing. Distressing with respect to a life left unlived in the way that Dickens presents the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, the film is superbly acted and powerful, one of the great 'unhappy' love stories ever put to film.

This is one of their most successful products as they were able to reunite the talented Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins to bring a difficult to adapt book to life. This is the sort of film that bolsters the reputation of British costume dramas as it questions British society and it's impact on those in lower classes while delighting in the period detail. I was really impressed by the film and while I love The Bostonians more this is one of Merchant/Ivory's best.\n\nDevoted butler Mr. Stevens, Anthony Hopkins, works at the palatial estate Darlington Hall where he tends for his employer, Lord Darlington's, James Fox, every need. He begins to fall for the new housekeeper Miss Kenton, Emma Thompson, but his complete loyalty to his work prevents him from emoting. Darlington develops Nazi sympathies which threaten his position in post-war British society but Stevens remains steadfast in his commitment to him and refuses to return Miss Kenton's affections toward him.\n\nThe film works because of the uncomfortable chemistry of it's two leads as the luminous but intelligent and sensible Thompson is a perfect match for the dangerously repressed Hopkins. Scenes of her playfully interrogating him about a romance novel he had been reading and him obsessively discussing how good she was at her job as an obvious cover for his romantic affection for her are melancholy and sweet because Hopkins so fully inhabits his character. Thompson is equally fantastic as she equals her performance in Howards End (1992) by making you care for her deeply with just a few looks or sad smiles, she's on top form here as she gives a wonderfully compassionate performance in In The Name of the Father (1993).\n\nIvory's direction is also fittingly elegant as we get a lot of time to marvel over the estate and see how claustrophobic it is with multiple well placed exterior shots. His abilities go beyond that however as he is able to make you care about moments that would be insignificant in any other story. He gives all of the actors, including Christopher Reeve and Hugh Grant, a chance to shine even if their role is only brief and never lets the drama rise to histrionics as the film is as repressed as Mr. Stevens. He appears to have an intimate understanding of how the British class system negatively effects vulnerable people and yet he was raised as a middle class American, what imagination he must possess.\n\nCinematographer Tony Pierce Roberts, also of The Client (1994) and White Fang (1991) fame, does an exceptional job at capturing the grandeur of their surroundings but also the loneliness that haunts Stevens as Miss Kenton leaves him. The sight of Kenton wandering through the yards and Stevens dusting and polishing various parts of the house are given more meaning when you realize that is what these people go through every day of their lives with almost no reprieve. The black and white of the color is scheme is simple but again, elegant and Pierce-Roberts does a good job contrasting the beautiful, expensive Darlington Hall and the rainy, mundane outside world that Stevens is so unsuited to. Britain is viewed through Ivory's lens as we feel as though we are always viewing private affairs that are not for our eyes but at the same time you don't feel like a disgusting voyeur, this isn't Peeping Tom (1960) after all.\n\nI'd definitely recommend the film to most but if members of your family or one of your friends is violently resistant to costume dramas then maybe this isn't for them. I found that even my father, who hates Far from the Madding Crowd (1967) and Where Angels Fear to Tread (1991), was really touched by this film although that may have more to do with Emma Thompson than the direction or cinematography. Of the 1993 Best Picture nominees this is probably my favorite other than the incomparable Schindler's List (1993) because it tells a story that's timeless with unmatched elegance.",

On the staff of the hall is the head butler, James Stevens.  Through his eyes we see the what took place in the hall over the last 25 or so years, including the lead-up to World War 2, Stevens' undying devotion to his job and master and his relationship with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton.\n\nWonderfully engaging, interesting and moving movie.  The main plot is essentially the story of one man, Stevens, and his devotion to his job.  Anthony Hopkins is superb as Stevens, capturing well the robot-like blinkeredness of a butler who believes duty, dedication and dignity are everything, at the expense of feelings and expression.\n\nAround Stevens are spun a few other stories, making the movie quite multi-faceted.  Among these, there's the history of the household, and Lord Darlington especially.  \n\nWe have the build-up to WW2, showing just how it developed, and how many were sucked into appeasing Germany in the lead-up to it.\n\nThen there's the relationship between Stevens and Miss Kenton, which provides some of the most emotional parts of the movie.  It also provides some great \"what if?\" moments.\n\nNominated for eight Oscars in 1994, including Best Film, Best Director for James Ivory, Best Leading Actor for Anthony Hopkins and Best Leading Actress for Emma Thompson, unfortunately The Remains Of The Day did not win in any category.",

            "content": "I re-watched this classic that I've always loved and found more in it than ever. It operates on so many levels--a character study of a man so introverted by the nature of his occupation that he cuts himself off from normal human emotions that he doesn't allow himself to show--grief at his father's death and love with a woman who loves him, that he lets go, because servants (and he is an impeccable servant) are not allowed to marry and stay in service. Then there is a view of a way of life on its way out--as we see being depicted in Downton Abbey and Gosford Park. There is also the tragedy of appeasement in the 1930s--letting Hitler have Czechoslovakia (where the Treaty of Versailles had set up literally tons of amor dumps, tanks and all kinds of war materiel, because Czechoslovakia was supposed to hold the line against German expansion in the future. Without all of those resources, Germany would not have been able to carry on such a European war as they did. He did not have the resources to launch a modern war before Czechoslovakia was handed to him on a plate, but afterwards with those arms and armament meant to hold him back as part of his arsenal, he was.) The personal tragedy of a nobleman who believed the lying Nazi officials, Even as they were noting (in German) which of his paintings the Fuhrer would want after England was conquered, just as the Nazis stole art all over Europe during WWII. Then there was the irony of the career American politician who called Stevens' nobleman employer \"an amateur\" and rightly pegged what a huge mistake Lord Darlington was making, taking over his country seat, lock, stock and barrel. And finally, the sadness that when the main characters, who love each other,  come together again, they still cannot admit their love for each other and this time, the lie is the woman's fault, when she does not admit that she is separated from her husband. Bothe have allowed pride and  the good manners of a good servant to get in the way of what they most desire. At the end is that wonderful bit of symbolism, the bird that was trapped in the chimney escaping in flight out of the window, as life will soon be leaving Darlington Hall, the symbolism of a dead way of life that will as the decades go on, probably become a museum of what was and is no longer.",

Unfortunately, the film's title feels reflective of the film's own inability to fully explore his important themes, and despite a 134-minute running time, I can't help but feel the film woefully neglects the tragic relationship between Ms. Kenton and Mr. Stephens, which should have been the film's central core, but is instead scattered sparingly throughout the film as remains of more developed, more poignant romance not expressed here.",

It's the perfect film for them, a touching, moving and gentle period drama, showing a time of class and distinction. In the 1950's, Darlington Hall in Oxfordshire has been sold to American Mr. Lewis (Christopher Reeve), who retains the head butler Mr. Stevens (Anthony Hopkins), who has just received a letter from the former housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson). It flashes back to the 1930's, when Miss Kenton started out at the house. The house was run by Lord Darlington (James Fox), who used the house for political delegations. With the rise of the Nazi's in Germany, the house is used to broker peace in Europe to ensure there won't be a war. Stevens stands by his master, even though when war breaks out, he's come across as a Nazi sympathiser, but he has feelings for Miss Kenton, but he never shows it to her. It's a very well made period film, done with a classy touch, and some brilliant supporting actors, including Peter Vaughn, Michael Lonsdale, Ben Chaplin and Hugh Grant. Merchant Ivory knew how to do British period dramas, yet make them mainstream.",

            "content": "What happens when you get Hannibal Lecter, Nanny McPhee, Superman, Charles from \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" and Ben Chaplin as a guy named Charlie (I really hope they did that on purpose) in a film together? Something not quite as exciting as it sounds, unless, of course, you take into consideration that this is a Merchant Ivory film, in which case, it's about as exciting as you would expect it to be: not terribly. Well, it sure seemed to thrill critics, though it's a shame it had the misfortune of coming out the same year as \"Schindler's List\", which was even more overlong, slow and old fashion, so much so that it was actually primarily in black-and-white. If you get provocative, slow period pieces and a few dirt-old filmmaking sensibilities, then you're pretty much a shoe in for critical acclaim. Hey, as much as the film stands to be better, it's still pretty undeniably elegant, which of course shows that Hugh Grant can be classy (Yeah, sure) and that Christopher Reeve was way more than just Superman, which sadly didn't stop him from getting stuck with that title. As for Ben Chaplin, I wouldn't so much say that he was so much succumbing to people's common misconceptions by playing a guy named Charlie as much as he diving in, because lord knows his birthname wasn't Chaplin and that when you're an aspiring English performer lucky enough to have your mother's maiden name be Chaplin, you're not likely to turn down a name change, as that's going to bring in quite a few role offers. Well, he certainly knows how to pick some good ones, or at least potentially good ones, for although this film is enjoyable, it gets to be too elegant for its own good.\r\n\r\nOkay, now, with all of my going on and on about this film being so slow, to my surprise and relief, the film really isn't terribly slow, yet it does still hit those points quite often, rarely, if ever to point of leaving the film to dull out, but definately to where the film's momentum plummets, and with it, engagement value. Of course, maybe this film would have its slow points if it didn't give them plenty of time to creep their way in, as one of the most prevalent flaws with this film is simply that it is just too blasted long. At nearly fifteen minutes shy of a whopping two-and-a-half hours, the film sounds too long, considering its story, and is exactly that, dragging its feet from one place to another, going padded out by repetition, as well as much filler that distances the film from substance for an extended period of time and leaves you to, with the substance, fall out of the film momentarily, especially during points in which the film, almost in a montage-esque fashion, showcases the unraveling of certain events to obnoxiously gratuitous urgent-seeming score work, an event that's overlong and overbearing the first time, yet returns oh so many times throughout the film. Still, with all of the moments in the film that expel your attention, it's not like your investment is all that firmly locked in, because, as I said, the film gets to be too elegant for its own good, not just to where it slows down here and there and drags on consistently, but to where it takes so much restraint that, all too often, it restrains from bite, and that is just the thing that ruins this potentially fine effort. Don't get me wrong, the film has its fair share of effective moments, yet on the whole, there is a certain degree of emotional distance looming over the film's resonance, diluting conflict, intrigue and impact, thus leaving the film to fall limp, and your attention with it. As I said, the film picks up here and there, yet it gets to those points all too steadily, outstaying its welcome and tossing in the occasional slow spots, made all the worse by hazed emotional resonance, until, after a while, the film finds that it has fallen limp more than picked up, and just enough to finally fall beneath genuinely good. However, the film's collapse is not much more than by a hair, because for every miss, there is a hit, and just enough for the film to ultimately stand as worth watching, and I do mean \"watching\", as it's not too shabby on the eyes.\r\n\r\nNow, in total honesty, one of the best pieces of photography pertaining to this film is probably the poster (Ooh, shiny Anthony Hopkins), yet there is a ceaseless grace within Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography, broken up by occasions of lighting that are truly breathtaking. The film is a visually striking piece, with fine art direction to compliment the production designs, which are dazzling yet far from overbearing, bringing to life the environment, and by extension, atmosphere of the world found within this story that deserves more than what can be provided by director James Ivory, who keeps his distance and restraint, to the detriment to this film, as many of his directorial efforts fall limp and betray the story's worthiness, of which, there is plenty, and just enough for you to still lock in just fine. Ivory does little to spark essence into this story, yet that's largey why the story does leave something of an impression, for although Ivory neglects to raise the intrigue of the film, he also manages to avoid diluting the film's intrigue with a lot of faulty moves or incompetence, thus making the film's tone more slave to the story than the actual execution, and while all of this slowness and dragging keeps the story from really picking up all that often, when the story does pick up, you feel it, certainly not as much as you would have if James Ivory put some blasted effort into the atmosphere, yet enough so that you can stick with the story, and with it, the film itself. Outside of that, the film owes much of its standing its ground to Anthony Hopkins, who has little to do, yet purposefully so. The James Stevens character is a willing slave to his work, seeking to get the job done and keep things in order while keeping as emotionally distant as he can, which of course leaves his humanity to take severe damage and himself to find much potential in his life squandered, thus making for a character that, in concept, presents quite a bit of material, only to go tainted by screenwriters Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's writing the role to be too broad, with limited depth and layers, and by extension, material for Hopkins to work with. However, come on, this is Anthony Hopkins we're talking about, and although his material is thin to the point of leaving him with little to play up, he stays faithful to the slickness of the James Stevens character with a smooth believability and charisma, and when material does finally present itself, needless to say, Hopkins delivers, providing subtle depth and sharp expressiveness that captures both the distance and humanity within Steven, into whom Hopkins gives us somber insight that defines our lead as a flawed human, noble spirit and compelling lead in a film that very often relies on him. Now, being that its story and subject matter is so minimalist, the film never stood much of a chance being especially upstanding, yet still deserves better than what it is given, though what good things it is given really do strike in a small but far-reaching fashion that gives this film the intrigue and depth that the key filmmakers can't hold together enough for the film to reward, yet the other talents who construct and carry this film can hold together just enough for the film to keep you going through and through.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, remains and all, the film has its slow spots, which are bound to be found amidst the film's ceaseless steadiness, spawned largely from considerable looseness that leaves the film to drag on, going plagued by repetition and filler that slows down the film's momentum, though not as much as James Ivory's emotionally distant direction, which leaves resonance to often fall limp and the final product to ever so unfortunately collapse as underwhelming, yet still stand as watchable, boasting fine art direction and sharp production designs that spark certain life into the story, which is strong enough to hold your attention all its own, though not without the help of a perhaps too restrained yet charismatic, occasionally subtly deep and altogether rather compelling lead performance by Anthony Hopkins, who helps in making \"The Remains of the Day\" the enjoyable and occasionally effective film that it is, even if it should be more than just workmanlike.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "A beautifully wrought piece about the dangers of living through the affairs of aristocracy, this film is the embodiment of the Merchant-Ivory set of films while also being a fairly faithful adaptation of the book by Kazuo Ishiguro. Though the book is well represented and the overall message and grandeur of the film was in no way affected, I did take issue with several liberties that changed scenes in the book, raised questions that needn't be, and arguably some choices were simply unavoidably strange. Characters were merged, POVs were changed, and undertones were glaring. But I digress, this film does justice to the text by showing the incomparable Anthony Hopkins in a role that could only belong to him. His instincts as a servant and as a man with \"dignity,\" as he espouses, truly embodied the character of Stevens. He seemed bland, yet affected, kind yet unbothered, and clinical while being personable and repressed. Oh, was he repressed. So enters Emma Thompson as Miss. Kenton, the housekeeper who keeps Stevens on his toes and challenges his pre-conceived notions. Their relationship really is the entire film, while also being about loyalty to someone who is blindly being led astray themselves in a long train of unforgiving ignorance. Stevens though, is a character whose psyche just goes deeper and deeper, a well of misgivings and fraudulent narration, unreliable in his own emotions and the way the facts of the film are presented. You want him to rendezvous with the one he longs for, but he is tethered by the belief that he has a grand purpose, and if he doesn't see it through than his entire life has been wasted. Next to Random Harvest this is the saddest film I have ever seen, because it rallies around an idea as old as time, and then doesn't see it to fruition. It's about longing, love, manipulation, and the callous reality that a life worth living is not expected to always be great. I find this film, and the book it is based off of, to be beautiful and poignant in its tender recognition of humanity. Though I don't agree with some decisions by the screenwriter and director, I do agree that this was a film that was difficult to put together, as there was first person narration in the book and none here. It really was a film that achieved on a level unexpected, and stayed heart warming throughout.",

It hit a chord and although boring it is realistic and doesn't feel the need to produce a happy ending..  You can dig further into it ..for example I was examining Stevens devotion and professionalism to his employer.  It raises the question how much do you morally sacrifice to stick to your own personal work ethics.  ie) The scene where his employer had his servants fired because they where Jewish, he was trying to keep peace with the germans and was treated like a pawn.  Stevens did not question his employer due to his loyalty and work ethic ,he risked the girls lives and they  where deported back to Germany and admitted later he was wrong for not speaking up.  This is just tapping the surface regarding what you could study in the book and film.",

I thought that the film would be boring although it had some interesting premises.\r\n\r\nBoy, was I wrong. Hopkins would give a career performance if he wouldn't be so awesome as Hannibal Lecter. For almost every actor this would be one though. He almost overshadows the rest of the sublime cast, featuring a strong Emma Thompson, a great James Fox and very young Hugh Grant and Ben Chaplin. All with nice British accents, which rule, as always in a film that is as British as anyone.\r\n\r\nThe terrific acting even distracts from the perfect costumes and the state-of-the-art sets.\r\nA film can merely live from performances and costumes alone but Remains of the Day can depend on its plot as well. Such a sad story... Maybe sad is the wrong word, call it depressing instead - but in a subtle way you won't notice in the first moment.\r\n\r\nHopkins plays Mr Stevens, a butler who showes absolutely no emotions as he faces rather unhappy occurences in his life. This non-depiction of emotion only makes it so emotional and powerful and sometimes you can even see a glimpse of sadness in Hopkins - not in his motions but in his eyes.\r\n\r\nMr Stevens, himself is a broken man after his longtime master died as a broken man. Mr Stevens' never relinquished in his loyalty to a man who ruined his legacy by some unfortunate choices he made in the wake of WWII.\r\n\r\nSuch a mindblowing performance by Hopkins who depicts a pitiful character with such a hard shell and a vulnerable core. It's neither revolutionary nor bold but a highly conservative take on British past with a Gosford Park-servants-behind-the-scenes feeling that I love so much. \r\n\r\nIt's odd that these attribute make it refreshing in a world of CGI toys and steampunk detectives blowing up the scene.",

Maybe it's because as subtly, powerfully good as Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson both are, they are undercut at several turns, too. The former never gets the cathartic moment of ultimate emotional unburdening that Ishiguro gives his Mr. Stephens, and feels a touch too automatonic as a result (and the Stephens of the novel would not go into the crying Miss Kenton's room to twist the knife as he does in the film). The latter seems oddly out of place in an undefinable way, as if she's surely too clever and handsome to be a mere housekeeper (although Miss Kenton does escape the servants' quarters, unlike the duty-bound Stephens). Maybe it's because James Fox is just a touch too ridiculous an upper-crust dilletante for Lord Darlington. Could be all of those things, to similar minor extents.\n\nBut really, it could be that the aforementioned precision of the novel, and the subtly unreliable narrative voice provided by Stephens, can't help but be flattened by the absolutist demands of the wide screen. Elements that were laid out with gradual technical grace in Ishiguro's pages are just launched out there by director James Ivory, like so many paper boats on a duck pond. The extent of Lord Darlington's dalliances with Nazi appeasement, for example, is not left as a barely-uttered mystery for long at all, compared with the half-acknowledged, half-justified truths favoured by Ishiguro's Stephens. Even well-established prestige-hawkers like Merchant and Ivory can't resist the lure of a good filmic Nazi threat, it seems.\n\nCompared to most big studio productions, of course, The Remains of the Day is downright minimalist, not to mention miraculously trusting of its audience's intelligence. But it's still the cinema, and the cinema, by virtue of its very formal standards, must always be dragged kicking and screaming towards ambiguity. Merchant and Ivory were never much for dragging anything anywhere as filmmakers, so to speak, even when it might well be necessary, and there are times when it could be necessary in the case of The Remains of the Day.",

Although based on a fictional novel, the movie provides believable insight to this forgotten and much dismissed topic, while mixing important events with unforbidden love. \n\nMuch of the movie takes place at the Lord Darlington's mannor which serves as a meeting place for politicians on the eve of the World War 2. The movie is filmed from the perspective of the chief buttler Mr Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) who witnesses most of the political activity taking place at the mannor. He is put into an akward position as his master Lord Darlington (James Fox) clearly harbours Nazi symphatetic thoughts. All this however is merely a stage for the unforbidden love story between Mr Stevens and the main housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson). The situation is made tense as Mr Stevens follows one of the most strictest codes of conduct ever witnessed, denying himself of any feelings which could jeopardize his work and Lord Darlington's approval. Miss Kenton on the other hand is much of the opposite of Mr Stevens being impulsive and emotianal creating strong contrast between the characters.\n\nOne might describe The Remains of the Day as slow and boring love drama which in the end serves not much purpose, but it manages to create and unordinarily intensive athmosphere in most of the scenes. Much thanks goes to Anthony Hopkins' excellent performance as the strick and seemingly feelingless Mr Stevens and Emma Thomson as Miss Kenton. Inspite of the utmost boredom most of the buttler's life must have been, the movie makes it interesting by picking the nodoubt rare and far between highlights of the serving man's life.",

This was much better than I remembered, before rewatching the film myself, I had recommended it to my friend to watch but kept mentioning to her \"but don't be surprised if you find it very boring, it's good, but you might get bored\". Well, it's certainly not for everyone, but if you give it a chance you'll be very pleased. The the thing I love about Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins, particularly Hopkins here, is that they manage to express so much without words, their facial expressions show so much. For instance, the scene where Emma wants to see what Anthony is reading, they manage to turn that into a huge scene when it's just a little moment. Anyway, I really liked this and am glad I watched it again.",

BUT it was the last movie at the end of my 'Emma Thompson Binge watch day' (I had watched Sense & Sensibility, Brideshead Revisited, Primary Colors & Howards End - all for the first time). So finally after about 6 years, I decided to finish Remains. So fucking glad I did. The performances, unsurprisingly, are amazing. Hopkins & Thompson are brilliant together. And it was just another movie/performance to remind me why Emma Thompson is my favorite actress. There's also one particular moment near the end of the film, that has to be either one of the saddest things I've ever seen in a movie or close to it. It kind of quietly rips your soul out, so heartbreaking. Loved this movie experience.",

Is that or is it not the wrong chinaman? \r\nStevens: Miss Kenton, I'm very busy. I am surprised that you have nothing better to do than stand around all day... \r\nMiss Kenton: Mr. Stevens, look at that chinaman and tell me the truth! \r\nStevens: Miss Kenton, I would ask you to keep your voice down. What would the other servants think to hear us shouting at the top of our voices about... chinamen? \r\nMiss Kenton: And I would ask you, Mr. Stevens, to turn around and look at the chinaman. \r\n\r\n\r\nLewis: You are, all of you, amateurs. And international affairs should never be run by gentlemen amateurs. Do you have any idea of what sort of place the world is becoming all around you? The days when you could just act out of your noble instincts, are over. Europe has become the arena of realpolitik, the politics of reality. If you like: real politics.

But what I do find a major irritation are those persons who are simply going from post to post looking for romance. \r\n\r\n\r\nStevens: In my philosophy, Mr. Benn, a man cannot call himself well-contented until he has done all he can to be of service to his employer. Of course, this assumes that one's employer is a superior person, not only in rank, or wealth, but in moral stature. \r\n\r\n\r\nFather: There was this English butler out in India. One day, he goes in the dining room and what does he see under the table ? A tiger. Not turning a hair, he goes straight to the drawing room. \"Hum, hum. Excuse me, my lord,\" and whispering, so as not to upset the ladies : \"I'm very sorry my lord. There appears to be a tiger in the dining room. Perhaps his Lordship will permit use of the twelve bores ?\" They go on drinking their tea. And then, there's three gunshots. Well, they don't think nothing of it, this being out in India where they're used to anything. When the butler is back to refresh the teapots, he says, cool as a cucumber : \"Dinner will be served at the usual time, my lord. And I am pleased to say there will be no discernible traces left of the recent occurence by that time.\" There will be no discernible traces of the recent occurrence by that time ! \r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Kenton: What's in that book? Come on, let me see! \r\nStevens: This is my private time.

The story is sandwiched in between the intermission of the world wars. Hopkins plays the part beautifully as the dedicated, reserved butler who pays all his alms to his employer. He resolutely goes about his business, not deterred by tragedy and triumph. Thompson plays the head maid with passion and endearment. She grows fond of Stevens but knows where his heart lies. As time moves on, ideologies change and feelings begin to sprout in Stevens. It is too late however, as he is a prisoner in the hall. The film also devotes an under text to politics and devotes the same themes to international relations and misguided ideals. A fine film with fine performances all around.",
