    "summary": "The film follows the misadventures of Jack Skellington, Halloweentown's beloved pumpkin king, who has become bored with the same annual routine of frightening people in the \"real world.\" When Jack accidentally stumbles on Christmastown, all bright colors and warm spirits, he gets a new lease on life -- he plots to bring Christmas under his control by kidnapping Santa Claus and taking over the role. But Jack soon discovers even the best-laid plans of mice and skeleton men can go seriously awry.",

            "content": "The stop-motion animation is great and all the characters are really well designed. However, the story is abit basic and short and for me just wasn't that engaging. While I do appreciate the music and the occasional musical number in a film, I'm not a big fan of musicals and since this one is 80% musical I found myself losing interest as it went on. Kids over the age of 6 will probably be interested in it and it'll be nostalgic for people who watched in the 90's. It's worth watching for the animation but if you're a fan of Tim Burtons other work than you should enjoy this too.",

Everything about the visuals were so beautiful and (most of the time...) evoked a cozy gothic feeling similar to the 90s Addams Family movies. \nSadly, that's all this movie has going for it. There are only a few good songs that actually serve a purpose for the story, plot and/or characters and I was really only interested towards the end when *kind of spoiler* all the characters banded together. I feel like this movie could've leant more into the coziness and showed more of the Pumpkin Town residents' pure love and happiness for Halloween. I know this doesn't sound very Tim Burton, but I think with an improved script and storyline combined with the visual effects and animation The Nightmare Before Christmas could be something special. \nOne more thing: whether you like this movie or not, it is definitely a Halloween movie... Christmas things only take up around 10 minutes or so of the time!",

On the one hand it is bizarre for how blatantly surreal its settings and atmospheres are, masterfully staged through a use of state-of-the-art stop-motion. On the other hand, it is bizarre for how blatantly basic its plot, characters and writing are; a movie that is clearly not made only for children, seems to have been written by a child especially when compared to other animated movies of those years. But probably the intent was neither to set up a particularly deep writing nor to create particularly stratified characters, but rather to transport the viewer into an incredibly gothic world dripping with a creepy atmosphere; and in this Nightmare Before Christmas succeeds flawlessly.",

The movie is about a skeleton called Jack Skeleton, who is the scariest monster of Halloween Town which makes him the most loved and popular of all. However, after one Halloween day he felt empty and with no purpose, so he goes to the forest to think alone, but in the forest he finds a door that leads him to a different festivity that now he wants to share with all the town, but is this the right thing to do?\nIn my opinion this is a really amazing movie. Is incredible how they animated so smoothly the whole movie, the music is so memorable and the story is so well done that you can actually see a grow on the main character.\nI would rate this movie as a five star, is fantastic.\n(=^\u25bd^)\u03c3",

The animation and designs of the characters is so well it still even holds up today! It's so shocking because this movie came out in 1993, almost 30 years ago, but the cinematography is some of the best i've ever seen in an animated movie. Danny Elfman is one of my favorite composers, but hearing him sing his heart out in this movie was a blessing for my ears, he gives a weight of sympathy for Jack where you can understand why he's doing it, but you know why it's wrong. Jack and Sally's relationship  is so beautiful and its probably because this sound track is so amazing, the whole score is based off of \"This is Halloween\" (which is a song i have memorized by heart) but just in different keys and it sounds so great. I don't have anything else to say about this film, if the short runtime bothered you, I think you're missing the point. The theme of this movie is simple but i love it.",

And I like a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands being my personal favourite, and I love Batman and Batman Returns too. Henry Sellick is also promising, from the likes of James and the Giant Peach and Coraline. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a brilliant film. Is it an animated classic. Yes I think it is! It is wonderfully weird yet lots of fun as well. Visually and technically, the film looks absolutely amazing, with wonderful Gothic backgrounds and detailed colouring. Skellington silhouetted against the moonlight is quite possibly the film's most haunting image. The story is great, about Jack Skellington discovering ChristmasTown but doesn't understand the concept so he kidnaps Santa Claus. And the characters are endearing and weird, ranging from jazz playing zombies, Four-tenor like vampires to a wolf man. Then we have the title characters, Jack Skellington is a wonderful protagonist, really interesting to say the least. And Sally for an inventor's creation is very beautiful. The songs from Danny Elfman(the fact that he didn't get an award for his score for Edward Scissorhands is the biggest music snubs ever) are great fun, haunting, funny, clever and intelligent. The voice acting is top notch, Chris Sarandon does a great job as the speaking voice of Skellington, and Danny Elfman himself provides the singing voice superbly. Catherine O'Hara is sweet and innocent, and Ken Page(the voice of King Gator in All Dogs Go To Heaven) is a hoot as Oogie Boogie. All in all, weird, but visually stunning, funny and intelligent animated movie. A definite classic! 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I quite like that its relatively fast paced at times - its certainly a bit of fun and it looks pretty good in HD. I appreciate well done stop motion animation and this is certainly one of those.

The visuals are beautiful and creepy at the same time and I just loved the creative and horrifying world of Halloween Town as it's full of monsters and creatures that will haunt your dreams!  I especially loved the main character Jack Skellington himself as he's such a charismatic and fun loving character that made me love every scene that he's in!  I also really liked Sally the Rag Doll, who loves Jack Skellington and tries to prevent him from getting into trouble when Jack wanted to be Santa Claus for that year (despite the fact that he's a living skeleton and he only knows how to scare people).  The music was fantastic as well, as my favorite songs are \"What's This?\" and \"Sally's Song\" and I enjoy listening to this music every year!  My only gripe with this film is that I wished that some of the characters' backstories were developed, like the main antagonist Oogie Boogie.  Overall, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" is one of the greatest stop motion horror films ever made and it's definitely worth the watch!",

Many of the visuals have Tim Burton's influence which is perfect for a Halloween feel to the film. The music is the highlight of the movie for me. Songs and score were composed by Danny Elfman and he also is the singing voice for Jack. Several of the songs are quite memorable, however there are a few that are forgettable. Oogie Boogie is a cool villain, but he doesn't have much screen time. A lot of creative ideas make this movie worth a watch.",

Disney of course will splurge out on this movie. Everyone and their mother knows about this movie. As a kid, I was obsessed with this movie but now that I'm an adult I can look at it differently. The soundtrack is FLAWLESS. I still love it. You should also listen to Nightmare Revisted. The technical aspects are amazing and I have mad respect for anyone who uses stop motion. Now with the positives, I must say... I don't think it deserves to be Tim's \"Spotlight movie\". It's simplistic but at the same time the end message seems to be \"If you're not good at something stick to what you know instead\" and that's discouraging. I think other Burton movies deserve the same love as TNBC and this IS coming from someone who worshipped this movie like it was some kind of religion before. Tldr: It's simple, charming, but oversaturated everywhere.",

Disney treats it as both as the film tells the story of how the monsters of Halloween Town decide to celebrate Christmas leading to tragedy of terrifying proportions. Jack Skellington is an excellent hero who inspires and is beautifully voiced by Danny Elfman. The lore is unique and immerses us in a world that is both eerie and fun. The music also by Elfman is simply some of the best music ever written for film. This movie combines state of the art stop motion animation with an incredible script, great characters and voice acting, incredible lore, and incredible music that makes this film a masterpiece that deserves the legendary status it now has.",

The images pop from the screen and are almost three dimensional in their depth.  It's a movie that needs to be seen more than once to fully appreciate the animation, the first time to watch the main characters and the second time to admire everything that is going on in the background.

With all the CGI fx that are done in recent years - it was a pleasure and artistic to see some stop action animation and models for the characters used in the making of this film.  The story is beutiful in a Tim Burtonesque world.  I happen to be a huge fan of TB, and this work of art brought me back to earlier days in filmmaking.  The characters are very real in their emotions and the theme is that just because you are different doesn't mean you are a freak.  This underlying theme is used in many of TB's films - e.g. Edward Scissorhands (wish they'd re-release that gem and Beetlejuice (playing now) and also Sweeny Todd and most of his body of work - I am not a fan of Mars Attacks! - but that probably is the only TB film that did not quite make the usual creativity level of TB's productions.  He is also an artist, doing some great sculptures that are involved in many of his films.  A true American classic - I imagine it has been shown all over the globe in foreign languages.  Great - great - great - even if you have seen it before, there is nothing like sitting in a real theater to view his larger than life (or alternative life forms) films!  Yes - see this one - I could see it again and again!  Highly recommend this wonderful work of cinema.",

The first thing is the moral of the story I like, but I think it is a bit over used, like someone needing more in life but then find out that all they needed was what they were doing. The thing that doesn't make sense is that Jack wanted something more than just the pumpkin king, so he took Christmas, then he was like \" All I really needed was one night of different so I'm fine now. I will go back to being the king of Halloween!\" That doesn't make sense. The other thing is at the biging of the movie they showed that they were going into the Halloween door, then you see Jack walking and found all of the doors. But he was inside the door but it showed no scean of Jack coming out of the door so what's up with that? The other thing is I never really liked the kids, they don't really have anything to do with the plot exsept for putting Santa where the Boggie Man was or whatever his name is, I never really liked the kids but if you like them that is fine with me. Lastly, I never really liked the man who owned the female Frankenstine, he was just a little too protective but I just that is what fathers are for. But other  those things I don't really have a problem with it, it is a good movie and I recomend it.",
