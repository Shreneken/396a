    "summary": "Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) is a small-town young man with a lot of responsibility. Chief among his concerns are his mother (Darlene Cates), who is so overweight that she can't leave the house, and his mentally impaired younger brother, Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has a knack for finding trouble. Settled into a job at a grocery store and an ongoing affair with local woman Betty Carver (Mary Steenburgen), Gilbert finally has his life shaken up by the free-spirited Becky (Juliette Lewis).",

The cinematography is excellent capturing very fine detailed shots of everyone in the families reactions and also sweeping shots of the isolated lonely surrounding. The editing is very well done with just some minor loss of focus in the middle but with good reason. The Pacing is excellent with the film doing a fantastic job in the first 30 minutes allowing us to feel the weight that Gilbert carries and from there slowly feel the struggle to lift that burden and feel joy when we see it lifted over time. This is a truly sincere and heartfelt film that never crosses over into purposely pulling on the heartstrings to make up for a lack of substance but does because you love these characters and become invested in them. This is a film everyone should see once. An All Time Classic.",

            "content": "This is a surprisingly touching film about a dysfunctional rural American family, with some pretty quirky characters and a number of now big name actors, including Johnny Depp as the titular character, Gilbert, and carer for the disabled brother, Arnie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio and John C. Reilly (of Stan & Ollie fame etc.), who plays 'Tucker Van Dyke' (a local).  I also recognised Mary Steenburgen, as Better Carver - she may be more well known as the mother in the short lived US show 'Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist'. \n\nAt first this film seemed no more than ok but by the end, I thought it had become really rather poignant. Its a bit hard to review in depth, without giving away spoilers but I'd say its a good film in terms of depicting how difficult teenage carers may find things, when having to look after disabled siblings and parents. There is a sad side to it and there are some mildly amusing moments too. All in all, its a fairly thoughtful watch, one I'd recommend if your interested in the story or particularly keen on the cast then I'd say it's worth seeing, yes. I certainly can't say I've seen Leonardo DiCaprio in quite such a similar role before, certainly.",

Reilly lately, which is never a bad thing, having seen him in Gangs of New York, Winning Time, and now Gilber Grape, over the last two days.\n\nI understand if people take issue with someone like a Leonardo DiCaprio taking a role like this to the lengths that he did but I felt he was authentic, respectful, and most importantly created the kind of tension and frustration that gives the audience a tiny glimpse of what circumstances can be like when a close family member suffers from an intellectual disability. 7.5/10\n\nNYT 1000: #269",

            "content": "The movie \u2018What's Eating Walter Grape' by Peter Hedges and Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m was made in the year of 1993. The cast of the movie consisted of the famous Leonardo Dicaprio, Johnny Depp who are both abled bodied people. Specifically Lenardo who played Arnie played the character of a male who had autism while he himself didn't have autism. While watching I can say that none of the actions or portrayals of the character of Arnie was offensive and it seemed that the writers and producers had studied and educated themselves on the condition. When watching the movie it didn't have the character Arnie as comedic relief and instead it felt like the intentions of the movie were to give the reality of an autistic young adult in the 90's where they can be misunderstood and mistreated because of the limited education and support. Arnie is sometimes limited by his disability, when he wanted to go somewhere or do something he would get up and go do it. I think the one limitation would be taking care of himself with his hygiene and eating food, he would always have bath time which was done by the character of Gilbert. There was a scene in the movie where Gilbert is occupied with his new interest and the new girl so he tries to get Gilbert to understand that he is old enough to bathe himself since he is turning 18 in a few days. Once he feels that Arnie most likely could clean himself he rushes out and leaves Arnie. A whole night goes by and he assumes Arnie is in bed when he comes in late but when he goes to the bathroom he realizes Arnie had stayed the whole night in the tub and the water had turned super cold. After Gilbert apologizes profusely but it still happened which he regrets. There are many moments in the story where he is faced with apologizing to Gilbert for being inconsiderate and becoming understanding of Arnie as the show goes on. I wouldn't say that the character Arnie reached a feeling of empowerment but I think instead reached a feeling of acceptance from those around him. At the end of the story Arnie is able to find comfort in the same person that Gilbert finds growth in which is Becky. For example, at the beginning of the story Arnie wasn't as friendly to her and would shy away from her but by the end of the story when he had no one to turn to he instantly ran to Becky's trailer in asylum from Gilbert and his actions. When she leaves he says \"bye friend\" which is new for Arnie to regard someone who is not his family as a friend. With this growth from Arnie I think he grew a new sense of himself while also knowing he can do things for himself without Gilbert which I think is very touching. Coming from a, if this is ableist or not perspective I think that the goal of the movie was not to make fun of those who are autistic instead I think that the goal of the story was to provide the harsh reality and hardship that comes with being autistic in the normal world, especially in 1993. I think that it was successful of showing a deeper understanding of Arnie and his struggles while also showing his successes and how he got there with the help of himself, his family, and Becky.",

            "content": "Ableism in What's Eating Gilbert Grape\n\nI chose to watch the film What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), a drama/romance about a boy growing up in a Midwestern town. The main character, Gilbert, is essentially his family's teen patriarch- having lost his father to suicide some years prior. His mother's morbid obesity renders her immobile, so he raises his younger siblings, Arnie, who has autism, and his sister. Gilbert's life is shaken up when Becky, a free-spirited traveller, arrives in town. Overall, I wouldn't say the whole movie is ableist, though it definitely falls into using some hackneyed and offensive tropes. \n\nOne ableist theme stuck out to me is that Arnie is used somewhat as a plot device to further the character development of Gilbert. He brings Gilbert closer to his love interest, Becky, with his outgoing and friendly nature. At times, it seems as though Arnie is the \u2018object' Gilbert and Becky bond over. On the other hand, the movie does have some good messaging around respect. In a critical scene in the film, Gilbert hits Arnie in frustration after he refuses to take a bath.

The older one is still living at home trying to keep everything together along with the older sister while the younger sister is apparently also brain damaged (or maybe she's just 15).  The father died a good while ago and the house is falling apart as it was a DIY job apparently in a time where building codes didn't exist.  \nAnyway, the film is rife with melancholly and interesting scenarios and heartfelt interplay between the characters.  Gilbert feels contempt for his mother, and it's explained some, and one gets the impression he's simply tired of the life he has and his mother simply personifies a good chunk at least of why he's tired of it.  One does get the impression that he could ease up and show pity instead of contempt but you also can imagine -- if you try --- the possibility that he's sick to his stomach of feeling pity for her and her mentally deficient son.  I can speak from experience that prolonged bouts of pity is extremely draining.  This guy's lived probably close to 20 years if not longer in this nothing horse town with his mostly broked -  out family.  Anyway, this film is extremely interesting while also arousing good size chunks of emotion.  It's probably one of my Top 10 favs.  It's defintiely one of the Top 100 movies, IMO.  I probably gravitate to it because my family is in some ways a little bit like that of Gilberts'.",

Reilly, Crispin Glover, Juliette Lewis, and Mary Steenburgen in great supporting roles. But besides perhaps Arnie, the most recognizable character of the film is the morbidly obese Bonnie Grape (Darlene Cates), whose weight is often the topic of the small town's legend and lore. It is Bonnie's weight that leads us to the powerful ending, bringing so much of the plot full-circle.

While he obviously loves them with his actions, you can tell he resents them because of how he talks about them. It\u2019s a little difficult to watch at times because Johnny Depp, particularly at that age, was a thoroughly likable and charming guy. Yet in this film, he is put in a role where he is closed off emotionally and acts with a lot of frustration and anger. I suppose Depp works well enough for the role of Gilbert because he manages to make you sympathetic towards Gilbert rather than annoyed with him. The more noteworthy performance in What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape is obviously from Leonardo DiCaprio. Fresh off his stint on Growing Pains, DiCaprio jumped into the deep end by taking on the role of a mentally-challenged teenager named Arnie. The best thing I can say about his performance is that it felt authentic, and I actually stopped seeing Leonardo and just saw Arnie. What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape feels small to me, and didn\u2019t impact me as powerfully as I would expect, particularly considering the subject matter. This is the kind of movie that could have easily made me bawl tears, and while I appreciate it not being overly saccharine, I wish I felt the emotions in a deeper way. I was almost to the point of boredom more than once while watching. I also struggled a lot with some of the subplots in the film. Juliette Lewis and the forced romance was not engaging to me at all. She\u2019s not an actress I like all that much, and this character is the perfect fit for the label \u201cmanic pixie dream girl\u201d which is rarely an interesting personality trait. Also, Mary Steenburgen simply doesn\u2019t fit the mold of the desperate housewife role she is forced to play. I kind of hated her whole story and how it was an issue that quickly became a non-issue. When you set up and resolve things that fast and with that little consequence it feels like it never should have been included in the film. Needless to say, I had some issues with What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape, but they weren\u2019t enough for me to label it a \u201cbad\u201d film. It is just OK.",

            "content": "A touching piece of Americana.\n\nLasse Hallstrom's coming of age drama What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) is an enduring classic of Americana as it depicts small town living Iowa. Hallstrom shows the absolute degradation of a young man forced to take care of his mentally challenged brother, morbidly obese mother, desperate unhappy married girlfriend, all while working a dead end job in a quiet little town he despises. What's Eating Gilbert Grape feels so real as every character is like someone you know in real life. They are so ordinary country people. This film is a testament to the average American. It really is a shimmering example of rural America.\n\nPeter Hedges' script is directly adapted from his novel of the same name. He creates a warm environment of brotherly love, empathetic understanding, economic stress, familial struggles, and familial love. His words all ring as if these characters might actually speak. The grounded realism of What's Eating Gilbert Grape enables it to persevere as a timeless film.\n\nHallstrom's direction allows for his actors to breath in an open scene full of life's little growing pains. His shots look so natural and sympathetic to his struggling characters. There is no judgement, only a realism that is deeply affecting. Sven Nykvist's cinematography harks back to his glory days as Ingmar Bergman's cinematographer. The outside wide shots make Iowa look serene, if desolate. Nykvist's cinematic look brings you to the heart of characters and their emotions indoors, while his shots look so profoundly ponderous outdoors. He captures a certain contemplative look in his close-ups and a sense of these people dreaming of something more than a small town life. Nykvist held dreams in his hands with his camera, while Hallstrom breathed life and compassion for unhappy people with his direction.\n\nAlan Parker and Bjorn Isfalt's score is filled with mesmerizing piano melodies that soar across Hallstrom's skies and landscapes. The score to What's Eating Gilbert Grape creates an enchanting musical aura of tender affinity for these simple regular characters trying to get by in life.\n\nJohnny Depp is phenomenal as Gilbert Grape. His eyes and face convey a deeper sadness and discontent with his life underneath his kindly actions. Depp portrays one of cinema's kindest heroes. His selfless actions and thoughts make you relate and care about Gilbert. Depp plays him so sincerely that Gilbert feels like you are watching a friend rather than a stranger.\n\nLikewise, Leonardo DiCaprio is outstanding as the young brother to Gilbert Grape named Arnie Grape. DiCaprio portrays Arnie with a keen optimism and a debilitating mentally challenging condition. DiCaprio looks like he is having so much fun alongside Johnny Depp that you cannot help but like his character. DiCaprio delivers a convincing and an engaging performance despite his young age. DiCaprio was destined to be a great actor from the start.\n\nJuliette Lewis gives one of her most likable and endearing roles as Gilbert Grape's girlfriend and Depp's love interest Becky. Her pixie haircut, energetic disposition, and sweet persona make Becky a delightful character to watch. She exhibits a dreamy quality that gives Becky an alluring mystique and blunt confidence. She is so fun and interesting opposite Depp as his love interest and foil. Their chemistry is apparent and believable. I completely fell for Lewis in What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\n\nI must mention Darlene Cates as Gilbert's mother Bonnie Grape. Her brave portrayal of a woman suffering from morbid obesity is simultaneously revolting and heartbreaking. She makes you despise how lazy and not nurturing Bonnie is, then you sympathize with her once she's mocked and apologetic towards Gilbert. Cates' notable speech to Depp in her bed is so moving and captivating that Cates could never top this performance as What's Eating Gilbert Grape is sadly her only film role essentially. At least she is immortalized affectionately forever within What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\n\nOn the other hand, Mary Steenburgen is so hilarious as the naughty desperate housewife Betty Carver. Her performance is gripping as a miserably unhappy woman longing for Gilbert's love. Her forward flirtations and desperate attention seeking is entertaining as well as sorrow laden. Steenburgen is amazing in What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\n\nLastly, What's Eating Gilbert Grape features several perfect supporting roles. Laura Harrington is so nice and motherly as the Amy Grape, who must take care of the house since her mother will not. Mary Kate Schellhardt is so funny as the mean teenage sister Ellen Grape. Kevin Tighe is perfectly pathetic as the loser husband Ken Carver, who has been cuckolded by Gilbert Grape sleeping with his wife Betty. Crispin Glover is creepy and hilarious as the good humored mortician friend to Gilbert named Bobby McBurney. Finally, John C. Reilly is so nice as the handy electrician and contractor friend to Gilbert named Tucker Van Dyke. These actors and actresses all contribute to What's Eating Gilbert Grape's realistic vibe.\n\nIn all, What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a triumph of beautiful direction and tender sentiment with excellent acting set to lovely music.",

What we have is a couple of hours in the company of a hugely dysfunctional family and I felt as trapped as Gilbert himself.

While the son stepping up to be the man of the house is not unusual when the father is no longer in the picture, the responsibility of taking care of his mentally disabled brother and morbidly obese mother was a challenge I had never seen presented in a movie before. The movie was filled with the tough times that try a family after the loss of a parent but also hope for new beginnings. Gilbert's view of Endora was grim in the beginning of the movie and there seemed to be nothing there for him except for his brother Arnie. When Becky came into town in an RV Gilbert began a transformation and when his heart opened up to Becky, it also opened back up to his family.",

He brings an optimism and compassion to his work.\n\nThis is set in a pairie town pre-cell phone era, featuring a struggling family. The family is held together by the will of the mother, an extremely obese shut in played by Darlene Cates. The father is long gone, and it was his leaving that drove her to eat and stay shut in. Two of her children do everything to care for the family, Gilbert played by Johnny Depp and Amy played by Laura Harrington. Gilbert especially takes a lot of responsiblity on his shoulders, between working bagging groceries to support the family and  taking responsibility for the care of his developmentally disabled brother Arnie, played by a young Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nAll of this responsibility is made lighter for Gilbert by his summer romance with a girl about his age, Becky played by Juliette Lewis. In order to focus on Becky, Gilbert has to shrug off the older married woman he is having an affair with (played by Mary Steenburgen). It's complicated and messy.\n\nA situation with brother Arnie escalates and Momma finds it in herself to leave the house for the first time in YEARS to go help her son. Following this triumph, she attempts to make some changes with the help of Gilbert and Amy, but sadly her health has reached its limit. \n \n\nWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape shows us love, family unity, struggle, loss, success, and survival. Most people can find something to identify with, something familiar here. Although this family may look different from most of ours. Few, if any, other directors have taken on the family dynamics involved with extreme obesity, and I doubt any have done it better than Lasse Hallstrom.",

The title Who Ate Gilbert Grape leads you to believe that someone or something is going to cause him to change his life for the better.  At best he changes his outlook on caring for his beloved brother Artie who he feels that no one should ever harm no matter what the reason.  However, in reality nothing changes. He still lives and works in no-name town Iowa caring for his dysfunctional family hoping to find true love and a true purpose.Leonardo Di caprio's character  Artie Grape is a 17 year old special needs kid who is turning 18.  He won an oscar for his role and I commend him for pulling  off such a difficult role. It may have been the best part of the entire film.  Unlike his colleagues he played the only static character and did so beautifully. Artie at the beginning of the movie was the same Artie that was at the end of the movie. Unlike the rest of the players he is supposed to remain static.  \nBecky, played by Juliette Lewis is the fair maiden that Gilbert Grape falls in love with (perhaps the character who changes the most).  Becky and her grandmother are stranded in their small town in Iowa after their car breaks down. As the story goes, she gives Gilbert a new way of thinking of life and gives him hope of a brighter future. However, any change she causes is subtle at best. Despite being their to talk with Gilbert all night after one of the most intense scenes of the film, Becky only gets him to elevate his level of responsibility of caring for his brother artie and supporting the rest of his family.  She develops an intent to change in Gilbert and finds her self falling in love with our story's main character.\nGilbert's two sisters also have an important role to play if Gilbert Grape is to rise and be the protagonist promoted of by the film.  While the director shows the role they play as being the other half of supporting the dysfunctional Grape household, they needed change in their character. As the movie progressed they should have grown to be more supportive of gilbert's dreams and desires to move out of their town and search after a greater purpose.  Instead, the two sisters Amy and Ellen (played by Laura Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt) play a static antagonist that demoralize gilbert's ambitions and encourage that fact that he is stuck in Iowa caring for their brother artie and caring for other needs of their dysfunctional family.\nPerhaps the most decayed part of their family is not the lack of a father but rather the lack of a caring mother.  While glimpses of a true \"mama bear\" were present Darlene Cates Character, Bonnie Grape proved to be a thorn in the side of the struggling family.  She provided \nThe Characters in Who Ate Gilbert Grape don't evolve throughout the movie. They remain static.  I would not recommend watching this movie",

I want...\"\n\nLooking back at Leonardo DiCaprio's filmography I'm constantly reminded what a great actor he is. In What's Eating Gilbert Grape, he plays a seventeen year old mentally ill kid in such a natural way that if I didn't know this was Leo I would've believed the actor playing Arnie was really mentally ill. This is probably one of his standout performances and is one of the highlights of this emotionally gripping family drama. However he is just a supporting character in this film as the title character is played by Johnny Depp, Arnie's older brother who is always taking care of him and the rest of the family. Gilbert's father has abandoned them and ever since he has been the male role model for the family in the small community where they live. He not only takes care of Arnie, he also has to provide for the family by working in a small local supermarket. He is ashamed of his obese mother (Darlene Cates), who simply stopped caring about her beautiful body after her husband abandoned her. Gilbert also has two sisters who help out with the family chores, Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt). The responsibility Gilbert feels towards his family has taken its toll on him and explains why he seems to be half asleep all the time. He has no time for accomplishing any personal goals or dreams and spends his few free minutes with his local friends, Tucker (John C. Reilly) and Bobby (Crispin Glover). Things take an unexpected turn when Becky (Juliette Lewis) arrives in town and the two form a special bond together. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is an emotionally gripping family drama that works thanks to the strong performances from the cast and a fantastically well written script by Peter Hedges. The film avoids feeling cliche or melodramatic and I found it to be an honest story. Lasse Hallstrom has been accused of being overly melodramatic at times, but I think that the director avoided much of those moments here thanks in most part to a well written script.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of the film, but Johnny Depp also delivers in a very subtle way. His character doesn't seem to say much, but the way he simply moves and speaks says a lot about him. He knows he isn't getting anywhere in life and feels stuck in this small town, but at the same time he has responsibilities and knows that his family relies on him to survive. He is trapped in a prison he can't get out of. He cares deeply for his family, but at the same time he resents them and it seems they have become a burden for him. The way he approaches the character is fascinating because he doesn't have to say or do anything for us to understand how he feels. We can easily identify and sympathize for his character. The chemistry he shares with Lewis is also strong. She is in some ways the opposite of him. She is free spirited and has travelled across several states. She doesn't have many responsibilities, and the two end up complementing each other quite well. Their relationship might not be the central theme of the movie, but it does lighten up the mood a bit. Reilly is always funny on screen and despite playing a more serious character he still delivers his usual quirky silliness to the role. All these small relationships are the central theme of the movie and the brotherhood between Depp and DiCaprio stands out above them all. I enjoyed this family drama and I'm glad I finally got a chance to watch it.  \n\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "A slice of life film about a small town family struggling to make it years after a family tragedy (the suicide of Gilbert Grape's father).  Gilbert is played by Johnny Depp in his (in my opinion) best performance of his career.  Depp was reportedly struggling with personal issues of his own during filming, and he certainly seems to use that despair in his performance.  A tremendous cast, including a then unknown John C. Reilly, a young and incredible Leonardo DiCaprio, Juliette Lewis, and many relatively unknown others who give this movie tremendous depth.  Everywhere you look there are talented actors adding color to this movie and almost every scene is affecting.  It's a toss up between DiCaprio's performance as a boy with special needs, and Darlene Cates, a morbidly obese woman who had never acted before in her life for finest performance in this movie.  Depp is excellent, but DiCaprio is a revelation and Cates is painfully honest and brave.  This movie feels more like what real-life feels like than most Hollywood films have achieved.  There are funny moments, tender moments and sad, lonely and desperate moments.  Life can be very hard, with responsibilities and relationships to manage, and this movie captures that struggle and makes it compelling.  Despite mostly positive reviews, this film remains underrated and is quickly becoming a forgotten masterpiece.",

The supporting cast are great, it's interesting to watch, and the chemistry between Gilbert and Arnie is really good. Peter Hedges did a great job adapting his own book into a movie  and knows what dialed kids are like with some great directing by Lasse Hallstrom. Only problem I had is that it's predictable at times, but the story also has some surprising moments too. What's Eating Gilbert Grape is a great drama that has done effectively well.",

Depp and Dicaprio really were standouts in this movie but the other characters besides Becky were not given enough background about. The beginning of the movie we are introduced to the other characters but that's pretty much all we learn about them. I would've liked to learn more about their family and especially more about their brother that doesn't live their anymore. The whole story itself was very interesting and fun. Though it was depressing at times it had a lot of heartfelt moments. Any moment between Becky and Gilbert or Arnie and Gilbert was really special and sweet. There's really no way you can't enjoy those moments. I really liked John C Reilly in this movie too. His character was generally really nice and helpful and just always made me happy to see him acting. I also really enjoyed seeing the changes that Gilbert goes through. He's constantly kinda in a eh mood but he's happy at times, sad, really mad, and caring. He has almost unlimited patience. The thing I didn't like about this movie is the whole Gilbert making deliveries to that one lady's house. That character got irritating after a while and I didn't care for scenes with her in it. I was pleased when she left the movie. I really liked the ending. It ended on a total bittersweet note which was expected but what wasn't expected was the (spoiler!) death of an unexpected character! I was shocked actually! Through great storytelling but some eh scenes What's Eating Gilbert Grape has a great story, great performances, and a great ending. B+",

The only ledge between the wheel for me is that it wasnt supported by such a good script. i thought that it looked almost like the actors were reading of the script and didnt learn them.
