Soon after walking away, the child lapses into a coma. While at the hospital, the boy's grandfather (Jack Lemmon) tells his son, Howard (Bruce Davison), about his past affairs. Meanwhile, a baker (Lyle Lovett) starts harassing the family when they fail to pick up the boy's birthday cake.",

And at first, this glance at the scum amd sludge and anomie of lif low life and high life in 90s Los Angeles is a downer; filtered through the ouvre of Raymond Carver short stories.  But at close to an hour it really starts getting to you; all the tragedy; the hope; the dreams; the sexual assaults; the reconciliations; the darkness of it all; the mountains; the rivers, the picnics; the suburbs; all this crazy life; filtered through so many struggling sad characters; it's almost like a modern Les Miserables.  And yet; in each story; just a smattering of hope; you really feel the pain and pleasure of each life presented; such a stunning mosaic of so many people.  By the end; at the unifying armageddon-ish earthquake which brings all these characters together; you're really quite moved; as you realize Altman has chronicled not only Los Angeles life; but life itself; for all of us.  Really quite breathtaking.",

With the exception of Jack Lemmon, who plays the same stammering character he seems to have played over the last twenty years of his career, the cast is uniformly excellent and the movie, despite the devastating heartbreak on display and its considerable running time, is a joy to watch.",

They keep throwing more and more people at you, as if you know them or have some reason to care about them. They all have their little stories that sometimes intersect, and then it all comes to a big dramatic conclusion that is disappointing and lacks finality. The difference is that Short Cuts is not part of a cinematic universe, these are not pre-established characters that I could learn about by watching their own movies, and there won’t be a follow-up film to resolve the storylines. Instead it’s just a bunch of horrible people living their miserable lives, and we get the joy of tagging along for the ride. Most of these terrible stories focus on broken marriages, infidelity, and death. There might be three sympathetic characters in the entire movie, and I was actually interested in their story, but Short Cuts doesn’t have time to dwell too long on any one group of people. You can definitely see that Paul Thomas Anderson drew a ton of inspiration for Magnolia from this movie. I didn’t particularly love that movie either, but at least he handled it a little better, and knew when to focus in on a powerful moment. Short Cuts is a movie that does nothing for me, and the few snippets of time that it was interesting and impactful were drowned out by the deluge of new characters and frustrating stories.",

Leading a large ensemble cast with an inter-weaving series of sub-plots (some more connected than others), Short Cuts was a big risk for Altman especially as he wasn't at his most popular phase when he shot it, but he has a strong basis for the film in its source material. Based off of the short stories of Raymond Carver, the sublime prose of those stories is readily apparent here (even if most of them are rather loosely adapted), and the material regarding marriage and sex are remarkably still raw by today's standards. Still, it's an Altman movie through-and-through, and he gives a bit of a Los Angeles-spin on Carver's work, by both capturing the massive landscape of the city, but also allowing more intimate close-up cinematography for the characters. The sub-plots are all human and fun, as well as quietly devastating at times too, and Short Cuts manages to conclude in a way that satisfies all the individual yarns, while not coming off as hokey. Ensemble dramas have become more frequent and idolized in Hollywood in the two decades since Short Cuts, but almost none of them are as worth the effort as this.",

            "content": "Raymond Carver wrote nine unresolved short stories and a poem set in the Pacific Northwest detailing American malaise and how alcohol and infidelity act as a substitute. Director Robert Altman transported these stories and expanded on them to the outskirts of Los Angeles among a cross-section of people unaffiliated with the entertainment industry. For the most part, Altman captures the spirit of Carver without doing a straight adaptation. Altman and Frank Barhydt wrote the script and they link the twenty-two characters together through random circumstances. It doesn't have the running commentary or overlapping dialogue we associate with Altman, but the multi-character viewpoint is there and the characterizations are more complex than in \"Nashville.\" Some of the stories and characters are more effective than others, and some have little relation to Carver at all. The presence of alcohol in the movie has less relevance to the overall action than in Carver's stories, and the earthquake finale fails to tie events together as successfully as the climaxes in Altman's best movies. At three hours, this moves at a fast clip. It comes closer to reflecting contemporary American life than almost any other movie of its era. Kudos goes to editors Geraldine Peroni and Suzy Elmiger. Among the standouts in the cast are: Bruce Davison, Fred Ward, Jack Lemmon, Lily Tomlin, Madeleine Stowe, Tom Waits, Tim Robbins, Julianne Moore. Also with Andie MacDowell, Anne Archer, Annie Ross, Buck Henry, Chris Penn, Frances McDormand, Huey Lewis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Lili Taylor, Lori Singer, Lyle Lovett, Matthew Modine, Peter Gallagher, Robert Downey, Jr.",

Short Cuts? Is it even Altman's best work? Well, everything unique and original in the other movies on this list was done before... by Altman. (Is there anything the man hasn't tried?) And everything Altman achieved in his career can be summed up in Short Cuts.\n\nFive of the entries on my list are genre intact: gangster, war, bio, sci-fi, adventure. Lynch is a genre of his own (a master of hook and subvert), Pulp Fiction is pomo-noir with a swagger, Tree of Life, an audacious and transcendent poem, Boyhood, literally an epic achievement of dedication and commitment. Short Cuts doesn't seem to fit in as it is merely an observation of lives and love. But what observations! What lives! What heartbreaking affection. All underscored with a resonating heartbeat patching into so many paths, teetering on the brink of disaster and threatening to explode, which it does, in the form of a climactic planetary stroke. Nothing brings people together quite like a natural disaster. An earthquake, tremoring just enough to inform us of our place in history on the cosmic map. Enough to bring us down to earth, reboot our egos, and put multiple perspectives in perspective. Enough to appreciate the simple state of being. \n\nA larger-than-life baroque master is at the helm, warbling out contrapuntal narratives and swirling themes orchestrated to perfection. Multiple story-lines wavering under one very singular umbrella. And under Altman's protective cover the talent runs free and easy, playful and experimental, ironic and sincere. The key characters in one story become walk-throughs in another, paradoxically tethered and disconnected from the self, from family, community, and life. Boundaries are crossed and souls get lost. We're all the same if only by not knowing what our needs are or why we're even here. With nothing to say except everything is exceptional, infinite and empty. And life is short. Shorts Cuts of scenes stories words actions desire love loss lies lust faith wonder and devotion. Heck, I'd see it again only to watch Tom Waits and Lily Tomlin shack up.\n\nSome movies claim to be infinitely entertaining, some maintain they can be viewed repeatedly without losing their initial charm, some insist they never age, I know only one that can lay claim to all such conceits. Short Cuts is like falling in love. It delivers quietly, wonderfully, naturally, tenderly, simply and deeply.",

Imitating real life, the story is often uneven, and gives its characters varying degrees of closure without spoiling realistic ambiguity, and some subplots are left open-ended altogether.  Despite its many challenges, including a running time that just exceeds three hours, Altman's Short Cuts is ultimately an engaging and rewarding experience, and although it was released in the early 90's, the film's glimpse of middle class egotism is applicable now more than ever in the age of social media.",

This is a film that feels like it was made to be viewed in film school.  It feels like it's the movie that Magnolia and Crash would look to as their starting points.  It's meticulously controlled chaos, due to Robert Altman's masterful touch. Famous for his large casts and layered dialog, both of which are at work here, he also manages to get the performances of a career out of some of his actors.  The actors that are already great, shine even brighter, bringing a vibrancy to the weird and seedy side of suburban L.A.  While the overall narrative may lack coherence, by which I mean, as a first time viewer 20 years after its release, I was expecting there to be some sort of grand intersection of characters to inject a kind of decipher key to the storytelling, each tale stands out on its own, odd merits.  There's a perfectly drawn out tension to each tale, that's almost imperceptible until you realize you've let out a sigh of relief when some of the stories come to rather sedate conclusions.  For those that don't there's a sense of vindication for realizing you've been put on your guard.But even then, the twists and turns go by with an almost muted normality for this almost foreign world, as if asking \"what else did you expect from a world that poisons itself?\"  If only we could all feel our own every day moments of life as poignantly as we're encouraged to feel the characters' moments in this film.",

Altman creates an all-too-real atmosphere that his ensemble cast thrives in; his subtle camerawork and the editing make this scattered plot flow like a natural life. Although, the film mostly relies on the masterfully written screenplay and the actors abilities to personify their characters and really bring the film to life.

Short Cuts is one of his trademark films, which features a huge cast and a huge runtime.\nI tend to like star-studded anthology pieces and although of Short Cuts' cast I only truly \"love\" Tom Waits and Robert Downey jr. I'm still impressed by the sheer amount of starpower.\n\nActing is pretty good indeed but my main point of criticism is the plot(s) anyways. Altman orchestrates nine more or less interrelated stories about matrimony and other relationships and a lot of problems that seem a bit artificial. In its structure you could compare it to P.T. Anderson's Magnolia - just that Magnolia is far superior.\n\nAs I wasn't fully convinced by the plot the film dragged along a bit. Merely any momentum builds, and so, we hardly get any suspenseful scenes and by jumping from one narration to the next all the time Short Cuts stays superficial for most of the time and it never gets really deep into any of the given relationships.\n\nNot very suspenseful, not very dramatic but a runtime of three hours... You see the problem?\n\nTo further illustrate what I mean, I'd compare the film to a random three hour episode of a daily soap just with better production values and more skillfully made.",

            "content": "Once October rolls around this 2016, it will have been four years since the first time I watched \"Short Cuts.\" It was during a party my parents had planned for weeks, the kind where a bunch of middle-aged friends get together and talk about their most prevalent life problems, their most recent professional successes, over fine wine and aged cheese.  Naturally, a fifteen-year-old with nothing better to do on a lazy weekend afternoon hardly has a place in that kind of setting, and so, for its duration, I locked myself in my bedroom and wrapped myself in my silken sheets, the best way to pass the time being the viewing of \"Short Cuts.\" I played it on the ancient family laptop that had a bad habit of causing perfectly healthy DVDs to skip at the worst of moments; on that machine's most vindictive days, remote controls would all but temporarily disappear.\n\tPredictably, the three-hour, seven minute long \"Short Cuts\" did skip and did, of course, tuck away its remote controls during times I'd prefer it wouldn't (a family friend came upstairs to visit me around the period Julianne Moore gives her infamous monologue, a teenager's dream).  But in those mostly uninterrupted three hours of viewing did my perception of film change shape.  A mind that once figured that movies with a slice-of-life demeanor were good enough, I had no idea that a film as epic, as astronomical, as totally real as \"Short Cuts,\" could possibly exist.  In an art form that prefers to have its greatest of works last around ninety minutes, to detail the lives of two or three characters at a time, to have a single, easy-to-follow plot, \"Short Cuts,\" lasting about as long as \"War and Peace,\" fleshing out some twenty-two equally main characters, and intersecting its many stories with naturalistic ease, was something completely ethereal to me.\n\tHow could Robert Altman, one of the great America directors (\"Nashville,\" \"The Player\"), juggle so many characters, so many storylines, and yet make them all feel as immediate as the other? How could all these big stars (some established, some to be established) leap off their untouchable pedestals and recreate themselves as people as real as you or me? How could a movie three hours in length not seem quite long enough? How could it be cinematically possible to go from a hysterically funny scene to briskly turn to a devastatingly melancholy one and still ring as cohesive?\n\tA little over three years and hundreds of movies later since that initial viewing, I suppose I expected to be slightly less besotted with \"Short Cuts,\" as I've grown older and wiser and am becoming increasingly immune to certain aspects of filmmaking because I've seen so much in such a short time.  But nothing has changed.  I claimed it to be one of the best films ever made back in 2012 and still consider it to be so today - a film so deeply human, so heart-stoppingly byzantine yet so onerously simple, is not something one stumbles upon often when seeking celluloid based escapism.  It's even rarer to find a movie where the characters do nothing but talk, live, and emote, and are just as thrilling to live vicariously through as Steve McQueen's metaphorical car chase passenger in \"Bullitt.\"\n\tThe screenplay, co-written by Altman and Frank Barhydt, is an adaptation of nine short stories and a poem by prolific writer Raymond Carver, whose minimalist prose and ability to draw lifelike characters within the context of a short story rendered him as a revivalist of the form in his heyday.  Unfamiliar with his work and more in touch with what surrounds his name on Wikipedia, \"Short Cuts\" only lifts his characters, not his settings (switched from the Pacific Northwest to Los Angeles) nor the way the individuals on display are inevitably related.  The film could be an assemblage of vignettes designed to arrive one after the other, but Altman, an auteur whose liking of the cliché that Everything Is Connected, does the impossible and links all twenty-two of its main characters with daisy chain strength.  Whether one is a neighbor of the other or if one is a cop stopping another character by chance for driving too slowly, the people of \"Short Cuts,\" regardless of class or race, compare in the ways that they're all trying to dig themselves out of gaping holes of discontent, though individual intensity, along with our reactions to them, ranges.\n\tJudge their everyday hardships for yourself.  We are voyeur to the lives of Ann and Howard Finnigan (Andie MacDowell and Bruce Davison), a well-off married couple (he's a TV newscaster) whose banal but comfy existence is shattered when their son (Zane Cassidy) is hit by a car.  Because he gets up and seems fine, and because he won't take any help because his parents told him never to talk to strangers, the driver, Doreen Piggot (Lily Tomlin), hesitantly departs the scene - at least she didn't kill him.  Her daughter (Lili Taylor) is best friends with Lois Kaiser (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a phone-sex operator unwittingly putting her marriage on the rocks because her husband (Chris Penn) is jealous that she never talks to him that way during sex.\n\t   Then there's Sherri and Gene Shepard (Madeleine Stowe and Tim Robbins), whose marriage is kind of shitty but somehow manageable; though she's aware that her husband, a motorcycle cop, cheats on her regularly (his current conquest is an equally morally unstable married woman played by Frances McDormand), she thinks his lies are hilariously fun to artificially buy.  Her sister, Marian (Julianne Moore), a bourgeois painter and her confidant, plays wife to husband Ralph Wyman (Matthew Modine), a doctor, but most of the intimacy that used to live between them has given way to distrust.  It might all come to a head during a dinner party they politely invite Claire and Stuart Kane (Anne Archer and Fred Ward) to, who themselves are arguing because he and his friends went fishing for a weekend and didn't let the dead body they discovered in their stream deter their fun until the Sunday they got back home.\n\tOther characters include Paul Finnigan (Jack Lemmon), Howard's father who decides to come for a hospital visit only to talk about himself, Zoe and Tess Trainer (Annie Ross and Lori Singer), a mother-daughter pair whose relationship is deterred by mom's fondness for liquor, Stormy Weathers (Peter Gallagher), the vengeful husband of Gene's mistress, and Earl (Tom Waits), Doreen's husband who might be irreplaceably flawless if he weren't so dependent on the bottle to get by.\n\tVerily, some of these stories are more engaging than others, but none of them ever feel unnecessary.  Like life itself, you have people you'd like to spend time with and people you'd prefer to stay away from, and, being the unfiltered reflection of everyday mundanity that it is, you've got to take the good with the bad and see where they all end up.  But in totality, there isn't a film quite like \"Short Cuts,\" unless you go down Robert Altman's filmography and start cherry-picking.  With its preeminent use of cross-talking for sake of verisimilitude, and for the way it's sad, or funny, in ways relatively down-to-Earth, we might as well consider ourselves to be watching a documentary.  Because that's what it feels like - \"Short Cuts\" doesn't so much regard itself as a movie as it does pass itself along as a collection of connected, average lives, riveting to watch because these people aren't so different from us, our neighbors, our friends, our family, our enemies.  We've all felt a desire to break down closed doors and see what goes on in the lives of those we know, those we know of, and the film very well might be a close enough representation.\n\tAnd since Altman pulls off that mightily difficult undertaking, his actors are faultless, too.  Everything about the ensemble is just about right, not appearing in roles but disappearing into people that might not be so much different from themselves (on a level of humanity, that is).  MacDowell and Davison are heartbreakingly emotive as people who once had it all, but are rapidly losing what made their existence something special.  Stowe and Robbins play house with convincing dysfunction, and Tomlin and Waits are touching as a middle-aged couple who are able to get by with little, able to keep their love alive after years together.  I love Leigh as the phone-sex operator, delivering dirty lines with passion as she performs blasé tasks like changing her baby's diapers and making dinner, and I love Lemmon's brief performance as an absent father so distinctly aware of his failures as a guardian that he can't help but ignore the traumas in front of him and make everything about his own past mistakes.\n\tBut perhaps the finest moment in \"Short Cuts\" is the climactic fight scene between Ralph and Marian, which is as tense and explosive as it is scrupulously humorous.  The scene, taking place shortly before their sure-to-be-awkward dinner with the Kanes, depicts Ralph confronting Marian about a past infidelity.  But just as things are about to get raging, Marian spills white wine all over her skirt, which she was planning to wear for the party.  She rips it off and attempts to wash it, completely nude from the waist down, having to still fight for herself as things get increasingly hostile.  Marian's nakedness is both surreally funny and representative of the way all affinity has left the marriage; so well does this couple know each other that such physical display is hardly titillating - Ralph is much more content screaming at his wife than paying attention to her nether regions.  The scene is bizarre, intense, hilarious, but also expertly performed; is there a more fearless actress working today than Moore (whose career began the process of kicking off because of this performance), and is there an actor that could play Ralph with the same believable furiousness? The actors are effortlessly able to evoke a feeling of a marriage gone stale, and it's one of the best conversations Altman has ever written.\n\tBut \"Short Cuts,\" if we're being general, is one of the best films Altman has ever made, a wide display of his eccentricities accessible and immediate.  Even those not as in love with it as I am cannot pass by its brilliance without highly regarding the way Altman so easily makes the complicated simple and oftentimes intimate.  It's a skillfully performed film written and directed with the finesse of a virtuoso.  Altman's career only contains a few unmistakable masterpieces, the rest mostly good but nevertheless containing more than a couple of clunkers.  But \"Short Cuts\" is one of his rare masterstrokes, sure to be considered his magnum opus if \"Nashville\" didn't exist.  Movies like this are what keep the art of cinema alive - childlike wonder is not an unnatural reaction to have in the face of its splendor.",

What makes \"Short Cuts\" such a masterpiece, and my favorite Altman film, is the way he trusts his cast and they in turn, trust him too.\n\nIt's this vulnerability that the actors/actresses let him tap into that makes the film so rewarding and engaging to watch. This film feels like a seamless novel rather than a collection of short stories (or \"Short Cuts\"), everything flows effortlessly whether it's from a heart-wrenching story of every parent's worst nightmare (Andie MacDowell & Bruce Davison), a sleazy LAPD officer with a hungry heart (Tim Robbins), an upper-class marriage that's hanging by a thread (Julianne Moore & Matthew Modine), or an aging jazz singer battling a serious alcohol problem (Annie Ross) -- the viewer will float from one narrative to another without feeling lost.\n\nAs with any Altman film (Nashville, MASH), this is an actor's film and the performances are what makes it hum. It would be easy for a movie featuring 22 main characters to suffer from under or overacting in spots but in \"Short Cuts\", even the non-actors like Tom Waits are holding their own with heavyweight performers like Chris Penn.\n\nMy only complaint would be that some storylines aren't fleshed out as much as others (the medfly invasion) but this is a minor criticism compared to the scope of this film and how perfectly it's put together. If you enjoy \"Magnolia\" (my favorite film) you will love \"Short Cuts\" because it's clear PT Anderson enjoyed it immensely. Do yourself a favor and take this one in.",

I love M*A*S*H* and Nashville, but wasn't quite as big on The Long Goodbye, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, or Vincent & Theo. I tend to doubt the claim that he was the world's greatest filmmaker, but this one was definitely pretty fantastic. It's an enjoyable but intense three-hour film about various lives in Los Angeles.\n\nThis is one of those movies, like Altman's earlier Nashville or Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, that has an enormous cast of characters, mostly strangers to each other, whose lives sometimes intersect in ways they aren't aware of. This particular group is enormous - perhaps 25 or so main characters. It would take forever to describe all of them, so I'll just say that some of the characters have very dramatic things indeed happen to them, while others are just seeing another week in their lives. Their stories are collectively very interesting, and half the fun of the movie is trying to work out the chains of connection which interlace them all.\n\nNot all of the many actors fare that well in the movie. Andie MacDowell's performance is actually kind of bad, largely because she sometimes has a stupid Texas accent and sometimes doesn't. Chris Penn's performance is kind of stiff and awkward, as is Lyle Lovett's. Most of the actors do really well, though. Tim Robbins is surprisingly convincing as an outrageously dickheaded cop, and Madeline Stowe is very appealing as his long-suffering wife. Julianne Moore has some of the best scenes of her great career here, including one in which she delivers a monologue while quite plainly visibly naked from the waist down. Jack Lemmon gets a couple of fantastic scenes as an absentee grandfather. Lily Tomlin and Tom Waits are hilarious together as an alcoholic old trailer-trash couple. Jennifer Jason Leigh is excellent as a phone-sex operator who does her job while changing diapers. Robert Downey Jr. displays a lot of that wicked charisma that's made him so successful. Most of the rest of the large cast does quite well in their roles.\n\nThe script was adapted from a bunch of Raymond Carver stories by Altman and Frank Barhydt. It's extremely skillful both in the way it connects seemingly all of the characters without drawing attention to the fact that that is what it's doing, and in the way it juggles the storylines to keep them all feeling simultaneous. The movie is so long that you get to feel like you've known many of these characters forever, and you're always surprised when some new bit of information about them is revealed late in the film. Scenes parallel each other in ways the characters will never know about. Altman's camera objectively takes it all in, letting us see all of the details and getting to know each character without taking sides in their conflicts. There is some of that trademark overlapping Altman dialogue, but not too much, and it didn't get on my nerves the way it had in the past. The musical score is one of those unfortunate '90s musical scores that hasn't aged well. Still, this is overall a great movie, one that actually does live up to its reputation.",

            "content": "After managing to escape largely cinematic abyss that was the 80s, Robert Altman had somewhat of a renaissance in the early 90s thanks in part to The Player, and this film.\n\nShort Cuts is a very loose adaptation of some of the writings of Raymond Carver, weaving together nine short stories and one poem into a tapestry of  life in Los Angeles that follows about 22 characters over the course of a few days. Carver's stories were originally not connected, and took place in the Pacific Northwest, but Altman decided to blend them together, finding links or short cuts between them to make a sprawling and colorful mosaic dealing with themes of death, infidelity, misunderstanding, jealousy, and the quest for fulfillment. \n\nIn many ways, I think I liked this more than Nashville, and found it even more accesible, despite the fact that this film is actually longer and a bit more rambling. Maybe it's just because I'm more familiar with the man's style and knew what to expect, which is something I couldn't say upon viewing Nashville.  I still think that Nashville is far more of a masterpiece and definitely more of an important cinematic and cultural touchstone than this, though. \n\nDon't ask me to list all the actors who are in this. That'd be insane. I will list my favorites though: Tom Waits, Lily Tomlin, Julianne Moore, Frances McDormand, Peter Gallagher, and Jack Lemmon. Plus, there's tons of nudity, and sexuality is a major part of this film in general. Some of it does start to become frayed and fall apart by the end, and, of course, some of the stories are better than others, but I do love the fractured, interconnected nature of things, and how some of the stories run concurrent with one another. \n\nAll in all, a film that was easier to get through than I might have anticipated. It's not a strict adaptation of Carver's work, and more like a jazzy, free form look at the essence of his stuff instead, but that's fine. If anyone could get away with doing that sort of thing, it was definitely Altman. As wonderful as this all is though, you might not want to approach this if you're an Altman newbie.",

This movie was the most depressing, pompous, overwrought, misanthropic piece of tripe I have ever spent 3 hours with. One of my roommates ejected the tape from the VCR after the movie ended and hurled it at the wall. I give it 20% for juggling the myriad of Raymond Carver-inspired stories, but this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder if film critics need to trade a few of their review sessions in dark theaters for a few hours at Chuck E. Cheese. I understand the premise and design of Altman, but the end result is so unfulfillingly gloomy and morose that it overwhelms the enjoyment of experiencing the film. I couldn't have cared less for these characters. An ICBM could've landed in L.A. killing them all and ending the film and I would've been happy at being spared the extra time having to watch their sordid affairs a minute longer. My advice - skip this movie and spend 3 hours at Barnes and Noble with a latte and a Raymond Carver short story collection.

Like a lot of Altman's work, \"Short Cuts\" feels loose and improvised although it actually sticks quite closely to the source material, often word for word. Altman has a way of making it feel natural, which is the essense of his style, and it serves Carver's work well.\r\n\r\nFrom the large all-star cast Lily Tomlin, Chris Penn and Jack Lemmon stood out for me. This is a film with many fine quiet moments, some less quiet ones, tragedies small and large, and a whole world bulging outside the parameters of the movie screen. It's populated with fully formed, recognizable characters and it rewards multiple viewings. There is a deceptively intricate structure to this movie that isn't necessarily apparent after a single viewing. (For example, and a mild SPOILER, I didn't realize one of the characters was a child molester until the second viewing. I'm embarrassed to say that I kind of sympathized with him the first time I watched it, and I just didn't pick up on it.) \r\n\r\nI think \"Short Cuts\" compares favorably to Altman's \"Nashville\", one of the greatest American films, and is light years better than \"Crash\" or \"Magnolia\", two fairly recent and wildly overpraised Altmanesque knock-offs. Those films hammered you over the head with their themes and were emotionally bombastic, Altman is much more subtle and assured. He trusts his audience and doesn't lecture to them. This is a great movie. 5 stars.",

In terms of primary actors, ones that had a substantial enough part to merit a supporting tag, I count at least 22 characters here; but more impressive than the sheer number of the cast is the fact that the film does not suffer from character overload, nor do their intertwining stories. \"Short Cuts\" is simply about human relationships, all of which seem to be completely unhealthy. The beauty of Altman's script and direction is that this isn't imminently apparent in all cases. Something as subtle as a sigh and a minor roll of the eyes speaks volumes in a film this well done. The acting in the film is, to be expected, great in most cases. Andie MacDowell, though not quite as insipid as usual, is still pretty bad, but gems like Lyle Lovett, Peter Gallagher, Tom Waits and a fairly fresh and new Julianne Moore more than make up for any minor acting mishaps. There are not many films that are so involved that I simply throw up my hands at the prospect of doing my standard summary review for them, but \"Short Cuts\" is one of them. The script is compelling enough to easily sit through all 187 minutes of the film without getting tired or bored a bit, and the ending doesn't disappoint (except that the family of Casey didn't know who killed their son), and the film contains a cool jazz score. Like Altman's other great films which I enjoyed like âM.A.S.H.â, âNashvilleâ, and âThe Playerâ; this one is I think his best, longest, and my favorite because of not the all-star cast, good story and script, but on a very effective and very influential moment that we get to see on movies and on real life as well.",

Yeah, thereâs an ending after three hours but if youâre planning to stick around after the credits for closure through all the interlacing meandering this movie does, youâre going to be sorely disappointed.  Now then, if you love ensemble casts, compelling stories and a director who is somehow able to juggle 22 parts for three hours, pull up a chair and steel yourself in.  Thereâs no way to do justice to Altmanâs adaptation of Carverâs writings in one review but suffice it to say, the good outweigh the bad, which is no easy accomplishment when you consider weâve got a child being hit by a car, crumbling marriages, thoughts of suicide, alcoholism, ignoring a nearby corpse, Alex Trebek and The Planeteers of âCaptain Planetâ fame.  And that's about 30 percent of the stuff going on here.  Itâs a movie that demands repeat viewings since these characters enter into and out of each otherâs respective stories and while some may perform better than others (Jack Lemmon shines while Peter Gallagher somehow manages to make using a chainsaw for revenge boring, Julianne Moore does surprisingly well while the almost-always reliable Andie MacDowell oscillates between âgreatâ and âwhereâs the fast forward button on this remote?â), the end result is one that leaves you feeling youâve just seen something great.  Granted, youâve seen a depiction of struggles in suburbia Los Angeles circa 1993, but itâs still pretty captivating.  Then you realize for how ârealâ this whole thing is, there are some notable âhuh?â moments (the ending being a big one, and for me personally, the fact that apparently there were no Asians or Mexicans in California in the early 90s).

People's daily stories always intersect in ways, which cannot be seen or understood, but if we could look at these stories what would we see? This is what Robert Altman's film Short Cuts wrestles and struggles with. If we could watch human's lives what would we feel? Sadness? Loneliness? Joy? \r\n\r\nBased off of Raymond Carver's short stories. Short Cuts tells the tale of 22 different Los Angeles resident's lives. Using an intertwining plot structure throughout the film these people go to clubs, clean pools, paint, raise children, cheat, drink, and sometimes run into each other. Literally, when Doreen, a waitress, runs into little Casey with her car, she forever changes his and his parent's lives forever. These different stories are sad, funny, and even devastating, but they truly depict the disparity of human life while pointing out the common threads that every one shares. \r\n\r\nThe problems of humanity are displayed with udder honesty. Altman doesn't give us an answer here, but simply presents us with the \"short cuts\" and lets us question them ourselves. We wonder why a mother would rather drink down her sorrows than show appreciation for her daughter? Why would a woman continually bring her young child into to her relationship problems? And why do spouses feel the constant need to hide things from their partners? \r\n\r\nOne particular story in Short Cuts finds the parents of their very recently passed away son confronting  a baker who had gotten angry when they had not picked up the cake they had ordered. The cake was ordered for their son's birthday party, which he never got the chance to celebrate. Upon hearing the news the baker's anger quickly  turns to encouragement. \"Eating's a good thing at a time like this,\" the baker says as he brings them freshly baked muffins comforting them with the best thing he can offer, food. \r\n\r\nMany of the other stories in Short Cuts also lead us up to a remedying ending like with the baker, but many of them fail to adequately finish. Short cuts gives us the build up for what we think will be a satisfying ending, but some of the stories leave you asking for a little bit more closure. For times sake some of stories' endings seemed to have been finished too quickly, and it is for this where Short Cuts slightly misses the mark.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for a film where plots happen at the same time to become overwhelming and confusing, but Short Cuts never comes across that way. The diverse plots easily start back up from where they left off continuing the story. We see the tragedies life can bring along with the joys, and Altman guides us expertly through the mess safely bringing us to the end, even if it seems slightly unfinished.",

One of my all time favorite films that's deeply rewarding each time I see it. \"Short Cuts\" is a masterpiece.",

The way they use Carver's name almost seems inappropriate; i've only read two of the supposed source stories, and they only form the most basic premise for a couple of subplots.  it was clearly unnecessary to give Carver credit, and I the film doesn't do justice to his dialogue or perceptiveness at all.  theres nothing about this that justifies 3 hours.  just go watch magnolia.  I dont care how much it borrows from this; it's an infinitely better film.",
