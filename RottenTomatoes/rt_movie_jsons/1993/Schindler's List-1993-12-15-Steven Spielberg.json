            "content": "Schindler's List, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a cinematic masterpiece that tells a powerful and emotional story of the Holocaust. Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand Jewish refugees during World War II, the film is a stunning portrayal of courage, sacrifice, and humanity in the face of unimaginable cruelty.\n\nFrom its stark black-and-white cinematography to its haunting score by John Williams, Schindler's List is a masterclass in filmmaking. Spielberg's direction is flawless, capturing both the horror and the humanity of the events he portrays with unflinching honesty. The film's attention to detail is remarkable, from the meticulous recreation of period costumes and sets to the use of actual Holocaust survivors in key roles, lending an authenticity to the film that is rare in Hollywood depictions of historical events.\n\nBut what truly sets Schindler's List apart is its emotional impact. The film is a gut-wrenching portrayal of the atrocities of the Holocaust, but it also celebrates the bravery and resilience of those who survived. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Liam Neeson giving a career-defining turn as Schindler, a man whose initial motivations are rooted in self-interest but who ultimately finds redemption in his acts of heroism.\n\nSchindler's List is not an easy film to watch, but it is a necessary one. It serves as a stark reminder of the horrors of the Holocaust and the need to never forget the lessons of history. The film's message of hope in the face of overwhelming despair is a powerful one, and its impact has resonated with audiences around the world since its release in 1993.\n\nIn the end, Schindler's List is a masterpiece of cinema that stands the test of time. It is a film that demands to be seen, not just for its historical significance, but for its masterful storytelling and emotional resonance. Spielberg's vision, combined with the talent of the cast and crew, created a film that is both beautiful and devastating, a true work of art that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer long after the credits have rolled.",

You can tell Steven Spielberg but his heart and soul into making this movie. It takes on a monster of a topic and succeeds in every way.  Similar to \"Saving Private Ryan\" you feel as if you are watching actual history unfold. You feel the horror, fear, evil, terror, and redemption. The acting is outstanding from all the lead and supporting cast. The soundtrack is perfect and very moving. I consider it one of a handful of perfect movies everyone should watch at least once. While the film can be extremely difficult to watch, I find it uplifting since it shows that good will eventually overcome evil, a single person can make a huge difference, and the human will to survive. This movie is also a warning to future generations to beware of hate and racism especially when it comes from leaders in power. The people of early 20th century Germany were no different then people today which means this atrocity can happen again if another perfect storm gathers. You are doing good by watching it with your loved ones and explaining its important to future generations. It's the best way to honor the victims of the Nazis and those that died fighting them.",

Despite being too distressing for some viewers i think this film is far too important to see , this is history, the acts committed at concentration camps were diabolical and evil, this film does not shy away from that.

            "content": "Yang) The 1993 film called Schindler's List we meet a man named Oskar Schindler and he\u2019s a person who hoped to take advantage of the upcoming war to gain a large amount of money. In order to do that Schindler forms good connections with people from the Nazi party and employed a man named Itzhak Stern to become this accountant. However just ask Schindler was starting to form his business, the Nazis were beginning to round up the Jewish people and sending them away into camps. So, Stern took the chance to use Schindler's new business to keep as many Jews as possible from being shipped off to a camp. Schindler on the other hand would remain mostly unaware of this for some time but through his connection with the Nazi\u2019s he would become more aware of the things that were happening to the Jews that would slowly start to change him throughout the film. To me Schindler's List is a classic film that did a great job in depicting the Holocaust and telling the story of how some Jews manage to survive the Holocaust. When it comes to relating with world religion, I think that Schindler's List also did a great job because the film doesn\u2019t shy away from what happened to Jew during the Holocaust and it chose to show. The Holocaust was probably the single greatest tragedy that have ever happened to Jews and to this day many Jews are still affected by that horrible event. This would lead to the creation of the word Shoah which represents the insane rage of anti-Semitic hatred that was loosed on Europe's Jews, and it would lead many people to question why something so horrible would even be allowed to happen. Through Schindler's List both non-Jews and Jews are able to get a better understanding of the horror that took place during the Holocaust.",

In order to do that Schindler forms good connections with people from the Nazi party and employed a man named Itzhak Stern to become this accountant. However just ask Schindler was starting to form his business, the Nazis were beginning to round up the Jewish people and sending them away into camps. So, Stern took the chance to use Schindler new business to keep as many Jews has possible from being shipped off to a camp. Schindler on the other hand would remain mostly unaware of this for some time but through his connection with the Nazis he would become more aware of the things that were happening to the Jews that would slowly start to change him throughout the film.\nTo me Schindler's List is a classic film that did a great job in depicting the Holocaust and telling the story of how some Jews manage to survive the Holocaust.

After finally getting an investor, Stern begins to hire as many Jews as he can for cheap labor and also to help them escape Nazi concentration camps without Schindler realizing it. When Schindler finds out, he is unhappy at first until he has to save Stern from transportation to a camp himself. Schindler witnesses the brutal evacuation of the ghetto Jews to the new labor camp and is disturbed by what he sees. Later in the film, it is revealed that the Krakow ghetto Jews were going to be exterminated. Schindler makes it his mission to save as many people as he can until the war is over. Though he saved countless Jews, he was still deemed a war criminal. \n\nBefore the Nazi takeover, Judaism was freely practiced among many Jews in Germany. They lived fairly normal lives with access to synagogues and privately owned businesses. After the horrifying events of the holocaust, many Jews questioned their own religion. They wondered, How could God let this happen? If God was meant to send a messiah to save the Jewish people, How could this holocaust be allowed to occur? Some Jews answered by stating that God does not control what happens to a person after birth. The only thing at fault here is the evil of the Nazis. Other Jews accepted that God must not be questioned and faith must always be a top priority no matter what. In the true story Schindler's List, Schindler was able to help many Jews escape execution and is now respected by generations of Jews today. It is actions like this that may help restore the Jews' faith in humanity and to acknowledge that there are very good people in the world.",

            "content": "Schindler\u2019s List by Steven Spielberg is an amazing film and may be one of my favorite movies of all time centered around this time period. The way in which the movie portrays the Jewish people and the rampant antisemetic behavior that had engulfed much of Europe was done in a very mature and respectful way and made sure that everything in the film was accurate to a certain degree. Schindler\u2019s List was clearly made with the sole purpose to draw more attention to the Holocaust and capture the very real experiences that many of the Jewish people had during that event. Schindler\u2019s List center\u2019s around a single man, Oskar Schindler, who is an up and coming entrepreneur who believes at first that he will be successful if he manufactures and sells tangible items such as pots and pans to be circulated in the Jewish ghettos. He hires an accountant by the name of Izhak Stern who is Jewish to, in a sense, run the company for Schindler. While managing this company, Stern hires only Jews to work at the manufacturing company and in doing so, avoids their deaths in concentration camps under the assumption that all of the Jewish people hired are, \u201cessential workers.\u201d Eventually, the Jewish people are moved out of the ghettos and into labor camps where they are forced to work without pay for the Nazis lest they will be killed. On top of this, the living conditions of the Jewish people in the labor camps is absolutely inhumane with the people not being given adequate food and water as well as being forced to work for many hours straight without being given a break. Oskar Schindler sees the atrocities that are occuring within these labor camps and hears of what goes on in Auschwitz and he decides that the best thing that he should do is to hire as many of the Jewish people as he can and put them on his list so that they will not be killed in Auschwitz including Izhak Stern who helps him put his plan into fruition. Schindler bribed a multitude of Nazi elites whom he had already a good relationship with to maximize the amount of Jewish people he could prevent from dying. In the end, Schindler saved around 1100 Jews, most of which have living descendents today. The practice of Judaism as a religion only occurs a handful of times around the film: the beginning where a group of Jewish people say a prayer around candles, a few Jewish items such as a menorah are seen in the background of the homes of Jews before they are thrown out, a man practicing Tefillin, some Jewish people that work for Schindler observing Shabbat, and a reciting of Mourner\u2019s Kaddish towards the end. While it may seem like a lot listed out, given the length of the film, these moments are few and far between. What the audience does get a good understanding of when it comes to Judaism, is the sense of community and oneness between the Jewish people. That bit I feel is really important, that even under persecution, the Jewish people are still very concerned with helping each other out because that\u2019s who they are. This film does an amazing job with showing that even though they aren\u2019t related by blood, Jewish people will still look out for each other and care for one another as though they are family, because in a sense, they are.

I wish the degree to which I enjoyed watching it even approached the degree to which I appreciated it as a work of art and as an important part of cinematic history. I absolutely hated that they shot it in black & white. I read over Spielberg's reasons for doing it and I just don't think they were enough to justify such a radical aesthetic choice for so lengthy a movie. Black & white was the default choice in the 40s out of necessity, not because it's better, and I think displaying the same atrocities in vivid color would've added a great deal of realism. The acting was uniformly unimpressive aside from Ralph, who as a relative unknown at the time was just a perfect casting choice. The plot had the same issues as every other biopic in that its subject was deeply imperfect but in this case Steven had already opted to shift a lot of the focus onto the Jews themselves, causing scenes like Oskar having sex with his wife and being reprimanded for kissing someone to feel completely unnecessary. The scene of him wishing he'd done more was well-intentioned but felt incredibly hammy. The scenes with the girl in the red jacket were touching in that it seemed to show Oskar realizing the Jews were fellow human beings and recognizing her among the dead had caused his shift toward saving as many as he could, but according to the director it was supposed to represent something completely different, meaning he failed to convey what he intended. I'm glad to have finally seen this, but ultimately I have to chalk this up as a surprising disappointment.",

The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox.",

When you watch the film, you feel such anguish and sorrow for the fact that events like this had happened in human history. Following the story of Oskar Schindler, a former Nazi ally who changes his ways as he wakes up to the horrors they are committing, the film follows his change and ways to try and save as much Jewish people as possible by hiring them for his workplace. The film is a movie about the atrocities of war, and how dark the depths humans could go to. But it's also a film about doing the right thing and fighting to help people as well. Its a really incredible film directed by Spielberg, and a testament to his craftsmanship and abilities. The way he makes this story and shows the horrors with no censorship is beyond commendable. He doesn't shy away from showing harsh truths, and that is why the film will stick with you, forever. And Janusz Kaminski's cinematography, which happened to be his first collab with Spielberg, is so cold and well shot. How he captures the film in black and white, really highlights the sombre nature of the story. Its one of the only films which has really hit me hard as soon as I finished watching it the first time. And the score by John Williams? Just marvellous. One of those movies you need to see, and one that should be shown to anyone when they ask the question: what is good cinema?",

It abounds in the highest quality within all elements from cast, acting, cinematography, sound, visual design and effects, costums, makeup, music to screenwriting and above all, direction. Nothing is left to coincidencial circumstances, and it's also obvious that much of the determination to make it an outstanding film comes from the director's and producer's own Jewish heritage. And because probably no other single story describes the fate of Europe's Jews during WW2 so close to in a nutshell, Spielberg truly needed to tell it, as best as perhaps only he could. Schindler's List is meant to be a lasting historical document, and in this Spielberg has succeeded, because this is beyond a classic.",

The beginning of the film is a bit slow and it can be hard to see the relevance of certain events until much later, but by the end of the film, the epicness of the story shines through. This film is also stuffed with symbolism, most of which, I'm sure, went straight over my head. That being said, it always feels genuine and never egotistical. Overall, Shindler's List is a beautiful tale of how one can fight against the system from within.",

Spielberg who is a Jew adapted the life of Oscar Schindler and how he saved thousands of Jews from dying in the Holocaust. This film is the definitive film on the worst genocide in history and for good reason. The film chronicles the beginning of the ghettos all the way to the rounding up and sending the Jews to the concentrations camps to die. Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler delivers the best performance of his career . A complex character consumed by ambition, greed, but then his humanity breaks as he struggles with the evils of the Nazis of which he is a part of. Ralph Fiennes personifies evil in a way only he can playing a monstrous Nazi SS official Amon Goeth as he displays zero compassion towards his victims and delivers monstrous barbarity. Spielberg uses tremendous restrain in not showing gory violence and overwhelming the audience with carnage. Is the emotion and suspense of the violence as people are disposed and their humanity disregarded.However the movie is brutal and one of the saddest movies to see with a melancholic score by John Williams that evokes the hopelessness of what the Jews felt. Making it in black and white is effective as it transport us to the 40s when it happened and it allows us not to focus on colors but on the dark reality of history's darkest chapter. This is Spielberg's magnum opus and I do not believe it will be surpassed. I will go on a limb and say is the most important film ever made.",

            "content": "In Steven Spielberg's great cinematic achievement, Nazi profiteer Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) wants to hire Jews from Poland to work his factory during World War II. At first, he wants to make money with his employees, but he becomes concerned once the Nazis attempt to persecute them in concentration camps. Spielberg, being the giant of predictable emotional payoffs even with his greatest directorial works, proves to elevate his cinematic eye by showing the brooding ugly terror during the Holocaust. For example, when the Polish Jews are forced to vacate to the Ghetto, or when the women have their heads shaved and get cramped inside the gas chambers, most of the horror comes from the claustrophobic hand-held camera movements and the bleak black-and-white shadows. Also, unlike his previous films, Spielberg's collaborator John Williams is free to suggest emotion via his melancholic Klezmer music. For example, when Amon Goth (Ralph Fiennes) is introduced one hour into the film, instead of throwing in sinister bassoon and string music, Williams keeps his orchestra quiet, suggesting a candid feeling and allowing the audience to meet the wildly violent loose Austrian cannon. However, when Williams suggests emotion, he hits the poignant notes perfectly. The greatest example of this comes from the end where the real Schindlerjuden place stones on Schindler's grave along with the actors who played them portraying their relatives. Once again, the scene was shot in a documentary fashion, showing what happened since the war ended, where the Jews are today (or were at the time), and how many Polish Jews exist today. So, as far as Holocaust dramas are concerned, Schindler's List truly is a brilliant yet brutal and fierce one and probably Steven Spielberg's best film. \n\n(4 \u00bd Factory-made Door Hinges out of 5)",

            "content": "To me, the main flaw of Schindler's List is that it is trying to be two things at once.  It is the story of Oskar Schindler, of course, but it is also trying to be THE defining film about the Holocaust.  The two goals are simply not compatible; one cannot make a respectful Holocaust film with a Nazi as a main character, even if he was a \"good Nazi.\"  The film's portrayal of Jewish characters is poor, with only a few recognizable faces among the masses, and even Itzhak Stern (the main Jewish character, played by non-Jewish Ben Kingsley) is barely developed.  The Jews are portrayed cowering in front of the Nazis, or hiding from them; they are seldom shown on their own when they might have a chance to display their true personalities.  There are a lot of graphic sequences of torture and abuse which are disturbing for the wrong reason; they reinforce the imagery of Jews as interchangeable and disposable, herded around like animals, since Spielberg has spent no time making the Jewish characters feel like real people.  Sequences of the characters reading out Schindler's Jews' names, presumably to play up the \"list\" aspect, do little to humanize the Jews.  Spielberg does better with Schindler himself, though he is subjected to a typical Hollywoodization of his narrative.  A person like Schindler, who was impulsive and opportunistic and didn't seem to understand himself why he did what he did, has a lot of potential as a psychologically complex character, and yet this Schindler is much flatter as he develops to the beat of the Hollywood drum, complete with teary-eyed speech at the end.  The film is well-made and has its moments, but it is best seen as a glossy Hollywood take on Schindler's story, and certainly not the ultimate Holocaust film.  It is basically the Jewish equivalent of a \"white savior\" film, created and marketed so non-Jews can be inspired by seeing a person like them acting as hero, instead of empathizing with the actual victims.  Imagine if the defining film about slavery starred the world's kindest slave owner as opposed to the actual slaves.  Schindler's List not only ignores how many people died, but barely acknowledges the trauma and loss of those who survived.  My grandma survived Dachau, and my grandpa survived Auschwitz; I have heard their stories, and this film does them no justice.",

A story of a businessman who over the course of the movie decides to try and save many Jews using them as workers in his factories. There are many brutal moments from the Jews being sent to ghettos, sent to labour camps before going to Auschwitz. We see the Nazi treating the Jews not as humans but people undeserving, they kill anyone who does not do as they are told. Fiennes character is horrible, his cruelty is seen as he almost plays a shooting game at many Jews. He is seen many times laughing, which is disturbing. Liam Neeson in his best role plays Schindler, we see him as a businessman using the Jews for cheap labour before seeing the horror around him and striving to do something about it. His relationship with Ben Kingsley's character is well done. Kingsley is terrific. Showing decency and emotion. Watching Neeson's character in dejection as he believes he could have saved more becomes a moment as we think how many should have been saved and the knowledge that many people and countries could and should have done more. The film in black and white using handheld camera has a rawness and honesty. Its a beautiful looking film about one histories most atrocities. The music plays around this so well, the violin pieces echo the history, the moment and the mood. I was appalled by much that happened and knowing its true makes it more shocking.

            "content": "Real Rating: 91/100\nStrong and persuasive without being visceral. Schindler's List touches on the lives of many without feeling too sentimental to its subjects. It wants to be objective and given what we have seen throughout the history of cinema, propaganda and jingoism. One needs an honest look at the tragedies of humanity.\n\nBE: It is Spielberg's masterpiece, and like Coppola, he spent the first little while trying to emulate it and then decided to just shoot whatever he wanted. The film is pure vision and drive. Everyone on set put in their best performance, and as always Spielberg's sequencing is outstanding, and most should be jealous with how easily he pulls it off. The editing is high class. With only a few issues here or there. It is incredible to think in a 195-minute movie that there are not huge chunks that you could remove, but somehow the editing has kept this behemoth of a film moving along at a steady pace.\n\nW: The dialogue is quite good, but one cannot help but feel that there is a touch of the Hollywood pen in the script, and it is Zaillian writing, so that goes without saying. Other than the faux tension ratching, it is very decent.\n\nC: Arguably Kaminski's best film, though the argument against that is Saving Private Ryan. So you can decide for yourself. That said, other than a few stutters with the camera. Like in the shot where they are bringing the lens down from the bridge to the boat. The film is shot perfectly for how you want this story to be portrayed, and that is what cinematography is supposed to do, it is supposed to accentuate the story. And the girl in red scene shall remain one of my favourites of all time. The shower scene aside, the visual effects excellent.\n\nA: Liam Neeson's best role, before he showed the world that much like Harrison Ford, he plays the same character in almost every film. Thankfully at this point, he is still fresh. Ralph Fiennes built a career from this role, and he would remain a constant in parts in need of snivelling yet powerful monsters for years after, but no character has matched his performance in Schindler's List and rightly so it is a convincing portrayal of a man lost in his convictions yet still has a shred of the humanity that existed in him before the war. Kingsley is excellent with a subdued performance, which is usually the best Kingsley, Sexy Beast aside. It gives Neeson's performance something to bounce off and allow for a better emotional understanding of the character.\n\nS: The sound is excellent, and the score is terrific. So much so it does make me ponder whether Spielberg's film would be the same without it? Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.\n\nPD: Is excellent save for the few touches in the concentration camps and only the most anal filmgoers are going to pick up on that.\n\nBA: Authentic and eye-catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes and the black-white filming does prevent it from being a little higher as it could be hiding a plethora of errors, but as is seen, it is well done.\n\nEVO: This is not a relaxing Tuesday flick, but it is a flick anyone with a love of films or humanity should see. I have not seen many people who have disliked it, Rita Kempley aside. It is a tough watch for some, but it is rewarding in its own way.\u00a0\n\nNotes: This film is one of the ones that made me realise there needs to be a standard with critics they do not need to follow mine, but they need to explain what they are ranking. The reality is their review is 90% EVO and with no thought put in. Take Rita Kempley who wrote for The Washington Post. She gave Schindler's List a 60, Pulp Fiction a 70, Supergirl the 1984 movie was given an 80, Mary Reilly was a 70, Splash a 100, so Splash is a perfect movie whereas Schindler's List is barely passable under what metric? She also ranks the Wedding Singer at 70 and Das Boot as a 60. All I learned from her reviews is that she likes crappy romantic comedies and does not appreciate long drawn out films, and if she was some person on IMDB filling out a review that would be fine. But when you are the film critic for supposedly one of the best newspapers in the USA. It looks foolish, with no sense of purpose. When you are ranking Summer School (1987) as an arguably better film than Schindler's List than maybe you should not be a film critic. Which raises the question of what are film critics judging? And do they even understand cinema?",

With this film, Spielberg really shows what masterful director he is. Liam Neeson also gives a jaw dropping performance as Oskar Schindler. I can say without a doubt that this is one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. Every single line, ever single emotion, Liam Neeson acts it out perfectly. The next great performance is what I consider to be the greatest performance of all time: Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes' plays this character so good, that Amon Goeth is arguably the most unlikeable, despicable character to ever appear on screen. (Amon Goeth being a real person makes his performance even more stomach wrenching). This is a once in a generation performance. Ben Kingsley also has an incredible performance in this, playing Itzhak Stern. In my opinion, Schindler's List is the most powerful, emotional and important movie ever made.

Spielberg, using the cinematic medium, connects its audience through time to raise awareness to the fact stranger than fiction of this history. Spielberg justifies making this film by not wasting one single frame to tell of the brutality and hope, it's an epic, it's watchable, and in making it so, means you can't look away.",

I'd like to see it remastered in color, but then again, I don't think it would hit the same \u2014 especially the \"Girl in Red\" symbolism. About that girl, of course, I was expecting to see her again, but as a sign of triumph, of hope, not stuffed into a wheelbarrow en route to an unmarked, mass grave. Schindler's List is a film I wanted to stop watching, but for the right reasons. The young girl screaming \"Goodbye Jews!\" as the Jewish inhabitants of Krak\u00f3w are removed from their homes and funneled into the ghetto, the Nazi playing piano while his fellow soldiers rounded up the children, the unloading of the suitcases and the piles of watches, eyeglass, shoes, religious effects, and Amon G\u00f6th's (Ralph Fiennes) breathtaking return to evilness (a hiatus that lasted all of about 30 seconds) were the scenes that stuck with me the most. \"I realize you're not a person in the strictest sense of the word.\" \u2014 G\u00f6th, might be the greatest pick-up line I've ever heard. When the children were being bused away from their parents \u2014 sporting smiles and enthusiastic waves \u2014 made my heart beat out of my chest. I could go on, but it's a film about the horrors of the holocaust, which should probably be mandatory viewing throughout America's high schools (from what I'm reading in the news\u2026) so you can imagine what to expect. Children hiding in latrines, a city covered in ash from burnt bodies, seriously, I have to stop. But the ending, thank God, does give us that hope to keep us from jumping into a well: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\"",

In telling one man's story of selflessness during possibly the greatest human caused atrocity ever done to our own species, the Holocaust, Spielberg is able to tell a story that is not intended to entertain, but move audiences. In every sense of the word, Schindler's List is an experience, it is more than just another movie you sit on the couch and watch. If you didn't ball out your eyes watching this then do you even possess a soul? At it's core, it is an example of the little glimmer of hope that is surrounded by hopelessness, it is the showing of the value of life. the real Schindler's List was and is much more than a list, it meant living when others died. I have seen horror films that are fake but are able to hold up my suspension of disbelief, but with this piece of cinema I was shown maybe the scariest thing ever filmed - what happens when prejudice and discrimination lead to violence. If you haven't seen this, go and rent it or buy it and cherish it as something not to repeat in our future here on planet Earth.",

            "content": "This was overall a splendid movie. The movie focuses on a businessman named Oskcar Schlinder, a shrewd businessman who arrives in Wehrmacht Germany and bribes his way into opening up a factory. He employs Jewish workers in his factories and ends up saving them from death. This was at a time during the Holocaust, an event in when the Nazi party of Germany rounded up Jews, and put them into concentration camps, and then exterminating them. At the beginning of the film, Oskar is shown as a pragmatic businessman, simply caring for his profits. Later on, he changes and up saving countless Jewish lives by having them work in his factory.\nThe film starts off in Krakow and shows Germans forcing Polish Jews into a cramped Polish Ghetto. Oskar, a member of the Nazi Party, bribes SS officials into opening up his own factory. To help him run it, he employs a Jewish official who has black market and financial contacts. Next up, a sadistic SS official named Amon Goth is employed to oversee a concentration camp site construction. After it is done, he orders the liquidation of the ghetto, and many Jewish people are killed in the process. Oskar witnesses the slaughter and becomes empathetic towards the Jewish community. In this, he shifts from a businessman's perspective to a caring human being. The film also did a great job of showing how the Polish Jews used humor in the face of extreme adversity. \n\nThis movie relates strongly to World Religions because it shows the amount of prejudice and antisemitism Jewish people have had to face. Antisemitism did not start in Wehrmacht Germany, it existed in Europe for centuries beforehand. The film features Jews praying to help them overcome their bleak situation in the Holocaust. this is a staple part of Judaism, using prayer and meditation to help overcome evil. It shows the spiral of increasing consciousness by exalting empathy and love for our fellow human beings, as emphasized by Schindler. This movie highlights the awful reality racism and prejudice can produce, for Jewish and non-Jewish people alike.",

            "content": "Spoiler alert. Schindler's list was a great movie that portrayed the effect of the Holocaust on the life of Jews from multiple perspectives. The film shows the progression of Anti-Semitism in 1930s Germany. It starts with the Jewish being driven from their homes and their businesses being taken from them as the German government makes it illegal for them to own businesses or get paid for their labor. One businessman named Oskar Schindler takes this opportunity to profit off of the Jewish community's misfortune. He decides to rebuild a company to make pots and pans with the money from Jewish investors and the help of an accountant named Itzhak Stern. With an entirely Jewish workforce, whom he had to pay only a fraction of the price that he would have paid non-Jewish workers, Schindler makes a fortune. However, in the end Schindler soon realizes that the price of his newfound wealth was too great and decides to spend all of it liberating his employees from concentration camps and pretending to produce munitions for the German army.\nThis movie clearly painted the picture of the escalation of Anti-Semitism in eastern Europe. The hatred for Jews spread like a disease, even to the minds of people who could not rationalize it. One scene in particular stands out to me showing a little girl angrily yelling \"Bye Jews!\" repeatedly as the people were lined up to be transported to ghettos. Jews were forced to wear the Star of David symbol on their arms to separate them from other people and required by law to identify themselves when approached by a non-Jewish person. The spiral of degrading their lifestyles progressed from taking their homes and businesses, to moving them from apartments to ghettos, and eventually moving them to concentration camps where mass murder was accepted as a daily reality. The most moving scene, in my opinion, is the scene where Schindler is preparing to flee after the war has ended and the Jewish people present him with a ring to show their appreciation for him saving their lives. This is definitely worth the 3 hour watch and one of the best movies I've seen this year.",

            "content": "Schindler's List is a film from 1993 based on Thomas Keneally's book Schindler's Ark. the film was directed by Steven Spielberg who also directed many other great films such as Jaws, Jurassic Park, and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The film stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler and Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth.\n\nThe story I personally felt was Really strong, and put to film incredibly well. The story was also very entertaining to watch unfold, and was really intriguing from start to finish.\n\nThe acting in my opinion was great especially Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, I felt that he was the perfect fit for the character and that they couldn't have gotten anyone better.\n\nThe character were strong and portrayed really well, but if I had one complaint it would be that they weren't the most memorable of characters, but that didn't really take anything away from the film.\n\nThe cinematography I found was exemplary with some outstandingly beautiful shots of the characters and scenery. \n\nThe settings were also really strong and pulled of really well, from Auschwitz to Plaszow a forced labour camp.\n\nThe set designs and props were done extremely well especially with the the factory's and camps.\n\nThe costume and makeup designs like the sets and props were also done really well especially with the Nazis and soldiers.\n\nI also personally very much liked the colour scheme of the film, from the black and white to the single red coloured jacket.\n\nThe film also had some very good practical effects which I thought were pulled off really well.\n\nThe film at points also had some really strong atmosphere which I felt worked with the story really well.\n\nThe emotion of the film was very strong and pulled off very well, but in my opinion it wasn't enough to cry over.\n\nOver all I give it a \n10/10\n\nMay be the greatest Spielberg film",

            "content": "Films about the holocaust are always difficult to watch because there is the constant temptation to look away. Who better than Steven Spielberg to make a film that leaves you in tears as it fully conveys the horrors that the Jewish diaspora experienced during this time while also containing moments of levity that allow the film to remain engaging. This was an incredible film to watch as it brought out all of the emotions that you expect to feel when watching a film about events that still have reverberations within our modern society, indignation, hurt, guilt, yet it's capturing of the small injustices and of complex, layered characters are what truly elevate it to being an essential film. \n\nOskar Schindler, Liam Neeson, is a wealthy Czech playboy living in Krakow, Poland as the treatment of the local Jewish population increasingly worsens. Schindler initially sees employing Jews as an opportunity to take advantage of cheap labor forces but his employment of them allows several Jews to list themselves as useful members of society and evade German Concentration camps. Schindler befriends higher-ups within the Nazi Party including Amon Goeth, Ralph Fiennes, the embodiment of the evils of Nazi Germany who is willing to senselessly murder Jewish children whilst also harboring an attraction to a young Jewish woman Helen Hirsch, Embeth Davidtz. When Schindler witnesses the liquidation of the ghetto he fully realizes the savagery and inherent wrongness of the murders of these innocent people and becomes compelled to protect them for personal not financial reasons.\n\nComing into the film I was aware that it was almost a \"white-savior\" or in this case \"German savior\", Schindler was an ethnic German, narrative being used but here Schindler is a flawed main character and we get to know suffering Jewish victims without them being hideously objectified. Schindler is a womanizer with very little respect for those around him and his initial decision to take advantage of cheap Jewish labor is in line with his attitude toward them for nearly half of the movie. When he does experience a shift we don't immediately get Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves (1990) style speeches about what is right and what is wrong, that is left until later. Spielberg trusts the audience to believe the terror in Neeson's expression as he witnesses the iconic \u00e2~little girl in red' as reason enough for him to change his ways.\n\nCalling the film \u00e2~subtle' is going a step too far but when dealing with a tragedy this great where the abuses were not small but inhumane and terrifying. The moment at which I finally burst into tears after they had been leaking out of my tear ducts for the past half hour was the moment at which a group of relieved Jewish women run across a field into a line-up of SS officers in an attempt to reach trucks carrying small Jewish children on their way to a Concentration camp. The image was so painful and so viscerally horrifying as I sat next to my mother and six year old brother that I couldn't help but be moved by the utter hopelessness of these women's actions as they try their hardest to reach the thing that means most to them, the innocent youths. No, the film is not a Krzysztof Kieslowski masterpiece with subtle imagery lurking in the background but the big statements that Schindler's List makes have their intended impact.\n\nThe cinematography is simply incredible as black and white is used not only to capture the period but also to capture light and darkness during a period when it seemed as though the darkness would never end. The sequence in which a young boy struggles to find a hiding place as he attempts to evade SS officers in particular showed the hurt and suffering that these poor children experienced whilst also showing the dilapidated surroundings that they live in, signaling that the war is ending. The John Williams score is slightly overbearing as it is in any movie because all of his pieces are powerful and memorable but here it distracts less than in later Spielberg films like War Horse (2011). \n\nFinally, the performances are terrific with Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes embodying the three lead roles with grace. Neeson carves out a character that is both a hard-partying womanizer, cold businessman and impassioned defender of the Jewish people. These three elements would not jibe if a lesser actor was carrying this part as Neeson brings a subtlety to his moments of reflection and a wide grin and confidence to his moments of gallivanting through dinner parties, he also has a great face for black and white cinematography. Fiennes gets the most showy role and he takes advantage of it crafting a character that is shallow, childish and worthy of ridicule as we watch him laugh uncomfortably and feel immense disgust for him as his attitudes towards Jewish people shift on a dime.",

            "content": "For my first movie review of this semester I chose Schindler's List as the film I would like to study and analyze to attempt to understand the impact that the Holocaust had on modern Jewish and non-Jewish thinking. The movie is directed by the famous Steven Spielberg and follows the life of Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, and his quest at saving all the Polish-Jews he can by initially employing them into his factories and then after witnessing the brutal realities of the Holocaust first hand, Schindler vows to save every Jew possible; his character progression from being not caring for the Jewish people to becoming a savior to them in a dark time is one of the most important shifts of character throughout the entire film. \nThis film is set in Germany during World War II in the midst of the Holocaust and even though it is three hours long and gruesome to watch at times with some difficult to swallow scenes that are all in black and white, the movie should be recognized as not just the best Holocaust film ever but one of the best films ever made because of how pivotal Schindler was at saving the lives of thousands of Jews.\n\tThe Holocaust is known as the Shoah by Jewish people and Schindler's List has an accurate description of what it would be like to be living as a Jew in Germany during World War II and it was gruesome. In modern history there has never been a mass genocide relatable to the Holocaust and this drastic event still has an impact on Jewish people today, specifically the grave of Oskar Schindler is showed in the epilogue of the film and Jewish people who Schindler managed to save are seen tossing rocks onto his gravesite as a show of respect to a man who risked his life for the betterment of his own people.",

This marvellous piece of cinematography has won seven Oscars and is widely regarded as one of the best war biographies that has been made. \n  It tells a story of Oscar Schindler, a man who saved about 1100 Jews from being murdered in Aushwitz.  This vanglorious and greedy German buisnessmen reavels to be unlikely humanitatian between barbarian Nazists. In the begining he aims simply to make a profitable deal, by employing Jews who agree to work for lower wages. However, soon he discovers that his choices  significantly impact lives of many people, saving them from extermination in concentration camps. Sourrrounded by greatfulness, which he does not necessarily deserves, he begins to transform his factory in sort of refuge for Jewish community.\n   The movie sucessfully shows Shindler\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s metamorphosis. It exposes his personal struggles with great tenderness and accuracy in well - constructed plot . For many people it might be suprising that movie does not show Oscar as a hero, but rather as a men of money, with a specific sense of good. Liam Neeson is excellent in his role, creating a convincing protagonist, while Ralph Fiennes gives his life performance as Tienes Goeth, bringing this vilan, mesmerazing personality to live. \n Although movie is not perfectly historically accurate, Spielberg succeeded in giving a spirit of cruel reality of war. Beautiful shots of camera, mostly realised in black and white, create unforgettable atmoshpere.\n  Overall, I believe that everyone should watch this movie as it gives a precious history lesson. Moreover, it studies human nature, questioning our ability to stand against barbarity in times of moral crisis.",

There is a scene that really stands out to me where a group of people are led into a room and they believe that it is a gas chamber, but then it ends up being a shower and they feel so relieved. This shows us the amount of horrendous near death stress they were constantly under.

            "content": "All it takes is a name. Names are important, as well as history. One name that stands out in the realm of entertainment is Steven Spielberg. And, in 1993, Spielberg made released two films that garnered widespread acclaim. The first was \u00e2Jurassic Park\u00e2?: a technological triumph that shaped the modern blockbuster. The other was a more personal tale about names in general; it's called \u00e2Schindler's List\u00e2?, and is often been regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. And for good reason.\n\nThe movie chronicles the terrifying experience during World War II known as the Holocaust: a horrifying termination and forced forced relocation of hundreds and thousands of Jews in Europe during this time frame. There were some who saved these Jews from persecution, but there was one who did more: Oskar Schindler. This movie showcases what he had to do in order to protect those of the Hebrew faith.\n\nThe end result is a marvelous and fantastic production that was gloriously shot in black and white (with traces of color at the beginning and end), and treats its subject material very seriously. Which can create some uneasiness among viewers, but the experience will be more than enough to view this three hour production.\n\nThe movie stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a man who seeing WWII unfold and tries his hardest to help the Jews live and not die. Under the guidance of his accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), who is also a Jew, Schindler must prove to the Nazi's, including Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), that these Jews are people, and not just a race that needs to die.\n\n\u00e2Schindler's List\u00e2? is a great movie that needs to be seen. But why?\n\nFor starters, the story is engaging and immense. Despite the three hour run time, the pace moves at a constant flow, and keeps the viewer interested. On top of this, the movie knows when to slow down, and when to step up the action. Like the eradication of Krakow where the most poignant scene occurs: a girl in a red coat is running among a black and white scenery. This infamous scene represents hope and faith in otherwise troublesome times.\n\nThe acting is another key role that makes this movie stand out. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley deliver great performances, but it is Ralph Fiennes that steals the show as the villainous Amon Goeth. Fiennes makes this character believable, despite him being one of the bad guys.\n\nThe cinematography in this movie is excellent. By filming the movie in black and white, the audience gets a sense of realism, as well as authenticity due to the film's strong sense of historical accuracy; this is from not only the sets and scenery, but with the costumes, and other set pieces like the cars and trains used. As stated earlier, there are only a few glimpses of color including the beginning opening titles, the little girl in a red coat, a candle being lit during the Sabbath, and the end with the following dedication: In memory of the more than six million Jews murdered.\n\nJohn Williams orchestration and score is one the most thought-provoking and outstanding scores this man has ever written.\n\nSteven Spielberg's direction is magnificent. From panning camera movements, to even times of when the action feels like it was shot on a handheld, Spielberg knew how to make the action stand out. Even with the actors, Spielberg knew how to handle everything that was happening on set. \n\nFinally, the most important thing to take away from \u00e2Schindler's List\u00e2? is the message: courage and gratitude can from anywhere. Even it is from one individual. It's a message that needs to be related in today's society, even if anyone doesn't believe it.\n\nIn conclusion, \u00e2Schindler's List\u00e2? is a name of a movie that defies explanation. One or more people need to see this film and just realize how important names can truly be in the annals of history.",

Liam Neson fits the role perfectly, making this one of his best performances ever in the history of motion pictures. Hollywood wouldn't dare to remake a masterpiece such as this one, because it would be a discrase to Schindler's legacy and memory!

The only scenes I took issue with was one of the final scenes in which Liam Neason (Oskar Schindler) breaks down. I felt he was forcing himself to feel the emotions rather than letting it naturally build. Not only that, the lines were rather clunky. It was fortunate Spielberg included the final scene with the real Schindler Jews, otherwise I don't feel it would've have quite as hard of an impact. There was also another scene in which women are discussing rumor of the burning and gassing of people. It didn't quite feel organic as it could have been. I would only have assumed they had relatives of Schindler Jews speak the lines but I'm not sure. All in all, Schindler's List is an incredably important film that not just history buffs should watch but regular people as well; especially teens. It's important to fully understand the gravity of the atrocities was the Holocaust. It's emotion, thought provoking, and beautifully orchastrated.",

It was unique in the sense that no movie has ever looked at the holocaust from both the nazi side and the jewish side. It gives a more in depth look at the characters and why they do what they do. Like in the scene when Amon Goeth is trying to figure out what he should do, he could either be more lenient or he could continue his killing spree. I'm not going to spoil anything but in this scene he takes a look at himself in the mirror and it gives us a more personal connection to him as a character. The opening scene was full of great shots and camera angles, but it also gave us some of the characterization of Oscar Schindler early on in the movie so we could have some insight into who he is. After watching this movie i truly believe you can never view the holocaust the same way, whether that be good or bad. Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job as director and the research he put in is truly amazing, this movie gives you accurate historical insight into why the nazis did what they did and also the jewish side.

It is massive in its scope, accounting for an entire Polish city's Jewish community. The story is absolutely devastating in its highly emotional representation of a displaced group of human beings. Schindler's List is a fascinating look at humanity during atrocity.\n\nThe protagonist, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a man of means that utilized his great wealth and charm to establish his business. Schindler's List portrays a man that profiteered off of Hitler's war crimes that ultimately must change in the face of the heinous activities carried out by German Nazis in Poland. Neeson's performance in Schindler's List is not only his greatest, but also his most empathetic and complex. He displays his wide range of acting abilities as a womanizing man that slowly realizes he could help the Jews throughout World War II. His performance affects your heart and soul as you cannot help but feel for his perspective. You see what he sees and come to understand how someone can transform over time.\n\nBen Kingsley plays Schindler's Jewish business accountant brilliantly. His acting is very subtle and emotive with his face, eyes, and carefully chosen words. Ralph Fiennes excellently portrays the cruel Nazi captain Amon G\u00f6th with such quiet evil and sincere madness, I guarantee you will be stunned by his acting. The acting from Neeson, Kingsley, and Fiennes will certainly reach you and pull you into the insanity and chaos of the second World War. Overall, the acting in Schindler's List is a landmark of stunning performances from the main and support cast.\n\nJohn Williams' score is absolutely beautiful and tinged with sorrow throughout all the most emotional moments of the movie. Schindler's List is brimming with the anguish of the Jewish suffering and German cruelty. The most intimate moments and intense sequences have Williams' stunning score swell for peak emotional impact. I found myself soothed at times and equally distraught with sadness at how subtle and powerful Williams' composition hits. The violins are particularly lovely. I think any audience member will have the main melody played by the violins engraved into their memory forever after seeing Schindler's List.\n\nSpielberg's own direction is immaculate in his directing, editing, cinematography, pacing, detailing, emoting, and framing. The choice for black and white really captivates the viewer as they are transported to World War II era Poland in all her pain. Spielberg deserves every bit of praise lavished on him for his leading Schindler's List from his mind, onto the screen, and into our hearts. Every scene is so beautifully set up, the framing shows everyone's faces, and the setting feels so real. The costumes look accurate to the time and location, while the lighting captures the eyes of the good speakers and the shadows of the villainous intentions. Spielberg truly managed to recreate World War II in Schindler's List in a way we can follow and appreciate all the anguish inflicted upon the Jews.\n\nYou must see this film.",

No film is perfect, but this one comes pretty close overall. If you have three hours to spare and you're in the mood to watch angry Nazis and German soldiers, this is a great film to watch. This one is one of my favorite World War II films next to Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, The Great Escape, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and The Thin Red Line. Out of all of those, Schindler's List has the best script.",

This novel won the best prize for fiction (Booker McConnell Prize) decades ago. This movie was likely portrayed by history teachers as historically accurate, so it was jarring to learn of its origin. Of all the things that happened in WW2, there is no need to fictionalize things, especially just to sensationalize it to sell more movie tickets/DVDs.\n\nThe movie itself portrayed things in a needlessly sexualized manner, and was over-dramatic as a whole. For example, did the woman who woke up from sleeping with the German soldier have to be topless? Isn't that sexist objectification of women? Doesn't belong in this genre. Pervs may like this, but if a movie is going to portray a grim topic it shouldn't do so in a dishonorable way like that.\n\nAnother thing is that it stereotypes all Germans as psychopathic, sadistic murderers who take every waking moment to victimize innocent Jews. It dehumanizes the German people with this stereotype, and could be used to justify any abuses against them. The movie doesn't take into account historical facts that would balance this obvious false bias, such as the fact that Jews declared war on Germany (Daily Express on 24 March, 1934) which led to the Jewish boycott of German goods. Nor does it mention that there were Jewish supremacist groups like Nakam (Abba Kovner) that attempted to poison the water supply of German civilian cities after the war was over, or how they coated arsenic onto the bread inside the camp where the German POWs were being held (because apparently some thought that not enough Europeans died in WW2). What about the Soviet genocidal brutality that went on in the gulags? This of course was not mentioned.\n\nAlso, there is nothing really different about this movie, from all the other movies about this topic. Using emotional scenes to tug at heartstrings shouldn't ever be considered as a replacement for historical facts.\n\nThe truth fears no investigation.",

But Schindler's List transcends politics to create a beautiful and mechanically flawless showcase of inhuman cruelty - indeed, man at his most profane and evil.  Spielberg is the Leni Riefenstahl of his day, but in contrast to her, worshiped for his good vs evil simplicity.\n\nMost of Steven Spielberg's films are popcorn entertainment, and in many ways, Schindler's List could be considered the popcorn holocaust film. However, I was in awe the way Spielberg masterfully played his audience. He shot the film as an artist, and with 25% of the sentimentality any other filmmaker would have used. More importantly, he used his technical skills to create a brutal and harrowing vision of Nazi atrocities in a way no other abstract thinker could possibly have done. Stanley Kubrick and Terry Gilliam once said that Spielberg failed to make a true masterpiece, because \"Schindler's List was about success...the holocaust was about failure.\" However, to me, this just makes Spielberg a success. How anyone could make a holocaust backdrop as an inspiring story of humanity is nothing short of genius. Spielberg earns the highest honor-he's Leni Riefenstahl good. And thank God he uses his talent for good and not evil.\n\nWhat I Learned: I think this movie really showed me how to present a narrative about death and despair in a mainstream way. I've always struggled with how to present such terrible visions that need to be heard, to an audience that wants to be entertained. It's not about compromise, the Propaganda Master said to me.

Honestly, I don't believe the plot starts until an hour in. Somehow, the riveting storytelling here keeps me compelled to watch every second. I just can't miss a frame. Even better, Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley's were so poignant. Every line was spoken with a certain level of emotion perfect for the scene. The characters were easy enough to like. It made this movie so much more heart-wrenching.\n\nOne of the most brilliant yet basic parts of this movie is that nearly every scene was filmed in black and white.

            "content": "Schindler\u0092s List is a very awkward movie to talk about and review.  It seems that the film is so deeply entwined with its subject matter that to criticize it is almost equivalent to condoning these actions from the past.  I will say that there is a lot of stuff that is extremely effective in Schindler\u0092s List.  It is emotionally resonant and conveys the darkness of those times.  There are many scenes that are uncomfortable to watch, but it appears this is intentional by Spielberg as he expresses the horrible nature of this moment in history.\n\nLiam Neeson is just fine as Oskar Schindler.  I wouldn\u0092t say he delivered much that stood out as special in the performance, but he crushes that final scene.  Ralph Fiennes plays a horrible Nazi officer, and he sells that character brilliantly.  It\u0092s more than just his despicable actions, but the facial expressions and body language plays into the evil of the character as well.  Then there\u0092s Ben Kingsley who can do no wrong, in my opinion.  He plays the role of Schindler\u0092s bookkeeper well, and you can see how he would be able to influence his boss and earn his respect.\n\nSchindler\u0092s List is very long at more than 3 hours and, while it\u0092s hard to say that extra time is not necessary, it certainly seems drawn out occasionally.  I think part of the problem is when the movie fails to focus in on Schindler\u0092s endeavors, and it takes a more macro view of the Holocaust.  These scenes set a tone and inform us of what is happening (and how life for Jews is getting progressively worse) but we don\u0092t totally see the connection between that and what Schindler is doing.  Also I see no real purpose in the heavy emphasis on Schindler\u0092s love life, because that all seemed superfluous..\n\nThe choice to film in black-and-white is an interesting one.  I wonder sometimes if Schindler\u0092s List would be a bit more effective at conveying the horrible nature of the gore if the blood were red and we had to witness the real trauma inflicted on the people.  However, the black-and-white does lend the movie a documentary feel which works well for this kind of historical drama.  The score is haunting, and conveys a perfect tone to the movie.  I can\u0092t say I was totally enamored with Schindler\u0092s List, but it\u0092s a tough one to watch so that\u0092s not really a surprise.  I definitely respect it, though, and think in many aspects it truly is a masterpiece.",

He started out making small things, like utensils but that turned into other things later in life. Some time passes and the concentration camps are becoming more prominent, and clearly now Schindler learns that the conditions on these camps, one camp in particular) are terrible and that many Jewish people could die. Schindler spends the remainder of WWII trying to keep his employees out of these camps and trying to keep as many Jewish people as he possible could out off the camps and therefore out of danger. He ended up losing more money that he made but it was to save lives and it was the best choice he could have ever made. Watching this movie was so hard for me, I was heartbroken at times but also I was extremely surprised to see how things turned out, I like to think that I live a blessed life and I try not to complain too much about the things that don't really matter but this movie really makes me think about life and how there is no way to tell where it is going or who will be there to help you or hurt you. When watching this movie one had to think about the idea of the holocaust from a Jewish person point of view and he extremely relevant it is to them and their culture. For a Jewish person, there really is no such thing as a new awakening or a spiral of consciences because this is a part of their culture, today Jewish people and non-Jewish people acknowledge the holocaust for what it was but at the same time only one group will ever really be effected by it.",

He likes to work in big, broad populist strokes, and his approach works best when applied to adventure films like the Indiana Jones series.  When he applies his craft to dramatic subject matter, he often lets down the material.  This is remarkably not true of \"Schindler's List\".  In telling the story of a morally lax, greedy opportunist who sets out to profit from the circumstances of the Holocaust, but ends up spending his entire fortune and risking his life to save hundreds of Jews who worked for him, Spielberg lets events speak for themselves and avoids crass manipulation.

For a film over three hours it never disappoints due to the pacing and the fact that there is always something happening whether it be Schindler plotting business with Stern or Goeth sniping away Jews for sport. One of it's biggest attractions for myself is how polar opposite Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler is in comparison to Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth. There is an emotionally devastating scene where Schindler explains to Goeth that power is not superiority but in fact the opposite. Then Goeth attempts to peruse Schindler's interpretation if power only to resort back to his savage slaughter of Jews. The plot allows the audience to take part in their own interpretation of the horror on screen by not using cheap tactics with music or jump cuts but instead showing it in it's gruesome obscenity. It is the greatest film to depict the holocaust due to it's ability to tell an incredibly entertaining character driven story as well as a documentary type look on what should never happen again. What's really great about it is that there is never any censorship used to maintain a rating of any kind. It shows extremely graphic violence and nudity in such a realistic way that for certain moments of the film I lost myself in the brutality like I was experiencing it myself. As far as the cast goes I was incredibly impressed with the chemistry certain members of the cast had, particularly Liam Neeson's business scenes with Ben Kingsley and especially Ralph Fiennes' romantic but at times depressing scenes with Embeth Davidtz. In conclusion Schindler's List is a masterpiece of film and realistic depiction. It's easily a five star film and perhaps Spielberg's greatest film.",

It is impossible to talk about Schindler's List without mentioning his photograph that puts us straight into the 1940s, and this was a very good choice for Spielberg, we have some colorful scenes that are absurdly significant, like the scene of the girl in red who Symbolizes hope, and then ...

Schindler's car travels on the broken Jewish gravestones that pave the road to Goeth's villa. Inside the villa, as Jewish musicians play unobtrusively, Goeth is surrounded by local police and prostitutes. Schindler encounters Goeth's maid, Helen Hirsch, who has been severely beaten by Goeth; terrified, she confides to Schindler about Goeth's frequent brutality and begs Schindler to find and save her younger sister. \nIn early 1940, Krac\u00f3w's Jews are forced into an overcrowded ghetto, while their Christian neighbors harass and spit at them. Despite vicious slogans and posters promising violent punishment for those who help Jews, Schindler assures his workers that they are safe with him. \nShortly thereafter, Schindler is arrested by the Nazis on a trumped up charge of some irregularity in his bookkeeping, but because of the intervention of bribed Nazi officials, Schindler is released. Later, however, when his workers throw him a birthday party, Schindler is denounced for kissing a young female Jewish worker. He is rearrested but soon released because of intervention from ranking Nazi officials. \nThe Schindler men are successfully transported to Br\u00fcnnlitz; the women are mistakenly routed to Auschwitz. Weeks later, Schindler pays officials to release the women to his charge, marking the only time that a train with living passengers leaves a death camp during the Holocaust. \nDuring the remaining months of the war, Schindler bribes and manipulates officials so that the Jews in his charge can survive; his factory produces no useable shells. At war's end, he exhorts his factory's German guards to return to their families peacefully and gives the remaining food and supplies to his Jewish workers. \nAfter the war, Schindler is unsuccessful in business and is often bankrupt, but he is well cared for by his former employees. Honored as \"Righteous Among the Nations\" by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust Museum, Schindler spends his remaining years traveling between Germany and Israel. He dies in 1974 at the age of sixty-six and is buried in Jerusalem. \nSchindler's list relates to World Religions part of Judaism.

The story takes place during the year 1939, a man named Oskar Schindler come to Krakow during World War 2 on business looking to make money. During that time Schindler became friends with the Nazi party, Schindler hired Jews as his employees in his factory. Schindler witnessed the many killings of the Jews and the concentration camps where they were forced to move to. A part in the movie that stood out the most was when Schindler spotted the little girl in the red coat as she was hiding from the Nazi but later it shows the body of the little girl on one of the wagons carrying the dead bodies. In the end Schindler and the Nazi must run from the Red Army to avoid being capture. This movie relates to world religion because of the religion of the Jews and the Nazi. This movies relates mostly to Judaism, the earliest reference to Jews is the Hebrews, Israelites and the people of Judah. (Brodd, 2013, 343) In many centuries that followed, the number of Jews living outside of their historic homeland ultimately far exceeded those living within its borders. (Brodd, 2013, 344) For more than two millennia, therefore, dispersion, acculturation, and resistance to total assimilation have formed the larger pattern of Jewish life and must serve as the backdrop to any discussion of Judaism as a historical religion. (Brodd, 2013, 345) Schindler's List was a very moving movie and showed the many things the Jews had to endure during that and all those innocent men, women, and children that lost their lives. Also the part that did stand out was the little girl in the red coat, she is so faultless and afraid and no child should have to feel that way. \nBrodd, Jeffrey. Invitation to World Religions.

The true story plot revolves around Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German businessman in 1939 in the city of Krakow, Poland. The film starts off with Schindler employing a Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), establishing Jewish business ties, and having Stern work as his right-hand man. Schindler starts off with a mindset of profit, contrary to his ending mindset. Jews in Krakow cannot own businesses, so Schindler decides to attract Jewish investors, and paying them back in his products, rather than currency in order to maximize his profit. After obtaining these investors (they give in to investing finally, realizing that currency is useless in the Krakow Ghetto), he hires Jews from the ghetto, rather than non-Jewish Poles, as they are cheaper to employ. This is where the accountant, Stern, comes into his role. Since these Jews hired from the ghetto are deemed essential by the local Nazi government, they are saved from almost certain death from the ghetto and the in-construction concentration camp. Stern realizes this, and hires more and more Jews in order to save as many lives as possible. Schindler is not onboard with this idea at first, but eventually he switches from profiteering to trying to actively save as many Jewish lives as possible, risking and sacrificing his own wealth in order to do so. At the high-point of the plot, the SS officer in charge of the local camp is ordered to kill and burn all Jewish inhabitants of Krakow in an 'evacuation'. Schindler then gives up almost all of his wealth and personal belongings in order to bribe the SS officer to let the Jews work for him in Czechoslovakia, sparing their lives. Schindler's List incorporates the use of black & white film in the modern era wonderfully, which is rarely seen.

I remember watching it on DVD when I was 15 and thinking that the girl in the red dress was a terribly sentimental idea. Right now, I can see it's a great dramatic tool. It hints at the protagonist's motivation and this is something a film with such an enigmatic leading character needs really badly. Oskar Schindler was a deeply flawed man and the film doesn't make excuses for his personality or his intention. But it doesn't criticize him, either.  It just tells a complex story and it's extremely inventive in combining the overall picture, the big picture, the Holocaust tragedy, and the deeply personal story. On many levels.

            "content": "The movie review of Schindler List by Leander Herring\n\n\n\tIn telling their stories, Steven Spielberg found a way to approach the Holocaust, which is a subject too vast and tragic to be encompassed in any reasonable way by fiction. In the ruins of the saddest story of the century, he found, not a happy ending, but at least one affirming that resistance to evil is possible and can succeed. In the face of the Nazi charnel houses, it is a statement that has to be made, or we sink into despair.\nThe film has been an easy target for those who find Spielberg's approach too upbeat or \"commercial,\" or condemn him for converting Holocaust sources into a well-told story. But every artist must work in his medium, and the medium of film does not exist unless there is an audience between the projector and the screen. Claude Lanzmann made a more profound film about the Holocaust in \"Shoah,\" but few were willing to sit through its nine hours. Spielberg's unique ability in his serious films has been to join artistry with popularity--to say what he wants to say in a way that millions of people want to hear.\nIn ''Schindler's List,'' his brilliant achievement is the character of Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson as a man who never, until almost the end, admits to anyone what he is really doing. Schindler leaves it to ''his'' Jews, and particularly to his accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to understand the unsayable: that Schindler is using his factory as a con game to cheat the Nazis of the lives of his workers. Schindler leaves it to Stern, and Spielberg leaves it to us; the movie is a rare case of a man doing the opposite of what he seems to be doing, and a director letting the audience figure it out itself.\nThis film I really didn't understand it, because the movie left you to figure it out on your own, however it relates to World Religion, because God was their Provider and Protector. Even though bad things would happen to His people-which [were seen] as the justified result of their  failure to honor Him and the way of life He presented to them-periods of oppression would always be followed by salvation, and eventually the persecution-ending, exile-gathering, peace-bringing redemption would occur. As the Passover haggadah expresses it, \"in every generation enemies rise up seeking to destroy us, but God delivers us from their hands.\" The Holocaust was World Religion.",

            "content": "Schindler's List begins with a pair of Sabbath candles being lit. A Jewish prayer is recited in Hebrew. It continues as the candles melt and as they fade and go out, the film turns to black and white. The smoke from the flame turns to the smoke from a train and you see the arrival station at Krakow. Jews would arrive 10,000 a day into Krakow from the country side and forced to live in the city. Oskar Schindler is seen going to the Judenrat which is the Jewish council. He visits and finds Itzhak Stern who has previously been an accountant. He's looking for Stern to assist him run his business. The factory will pay for goods in exchange for Jewish investors since Jew's cannot receive money. The workers are deemed essential and cannot be sent to the death camp being built (Plasz\u00f3w). Schindler is then at a church to secure a source for goods and materials to provide, he will later order things that the Jew's working for him would want. Before long Jew's are forced from their homes and into a 16-block ghetto. There is a little girl yelling 'goodbye Jews' which is more significant than anyone knows at the time. Schindler and Stern meet and say goods will be the new currency and that Jews are cheaper to employ than Poles. Stern agrees to help Schindler. In a raid of the ghetto, the Jewish are forced onto trains to Plasz\u00f3w and found in floors, furniture etc and some killed in streets. Schindler see's this and begins to realize what is happening to those being moved. After meeting with Helen and Stern many times he realizes what Goeth is doing and what is happening at the death camps. Schindler has Stern make a list of all the people he intends to buy and presents it to Goeth. They are separated and the women end up at Auschwitz where Schindler must pay for them again. He hides them at factory in his hometown until the war ends. Schindler allows the Rabbi to prepare for the Sabbath at sundown on a Friday, allowing the Jew's to begin returning to their religious beliefs. The Germans find out what Schindler has done for the last seven months and he must flee, but he has saved 1,100 lives. He is presented with a ring made from the Talmud for his saving lives. The movie returns to color and shows footage of holocaust survivors walking free. \nIt goes without saying the holocaust greatly impacted Jewish and non-Jewish. There were those who believe that God was still there through and after the holocaust and that humanity must play itself out and that God cannot change this. Others became non-believing in God, however some say that even this belief shows at the deepest roots, people still believe in God.",

Ben Kingsley also stars as Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant under Schindler's employ, and Ralph Fiennes as Nazi officer Amon Goth.\n\nHas there ever been a movie you've always wanted to see but have never taken the time to watch? That was my situation with Schindler's List. I had heard fantastic things about it, but just didn't want to take the 3+ hours to sit down and watch. I jumped at the first good opportunity I had to view this movie, and I'm glad I did. Schindler's List is a masterpiece.\n\nTypically, I'm not the biggest fan of Spielberg movies. I find a lot of his works are a bit overrated. However, there's no denying that he is an expert when it comes to crafting a production. Every stylistic decision Spielberg made paid off; the black-and-white recording effectively painted the bleakness and hopelessness of the Holocaust, and the cinematography and editing always matched the scene presented (quick edits during the frantic purges, etc). There was also one big instance of color in the film: Schindler spotted a little girl in a red coat running during a scene where Jews were being purged out of their homes. Later, Schindler saw that girl dead, still wearing her red coat. To me, that symbolized the turning point in Schindler's mindset, where he went from businessman to savior. Little things like this throughout the film really stood out, and John Williams' score only magnified the emotional impact of each scene.\n\nOf course, it helps that Spielberg had tremendous talent to work with. Liam Neeson delivers his best performance to date as the layered Schindler, and Kingsley and Fiennes give powerful deliveries as well. Neeson especially delivers towards the end of the movie, his scene with Fiennes about what power really is standing out. And yes, I teared up at the end during Schindler's final scene with his employees.\n\nI hate to be nit-picky with a movie like this, but there is one thing that bugged me. The length of scenes depicting the hardship of the Jews were unnecessarily long. I understand that it's that way on purpose to emphasize the horror of the Holocaust, but a lot of those scenes seemed to go on and on. Some of those scenes could have been cut down without sacrificing their impact. It would have helped the run time of the movie as well, keeping it at 3 hours instead of going over.\n\nOverall, this is a must-see for everybody, movie fan or not. Spielberg delivers what I believe to be his best film, and the entire cast shows up to play. I'll probably never watch this movie again, but I'm forever glad I did. If you find yourself in the right mindset with 3+ hours to kill, go watch Schindler's List and let it change your life.\n\nFinal grade: A\n\n-Ben",

What I love the most about this movie is its historical atmosphere. Not only has Steven Spielberg crafted a cinematic masterpiece but he has successfully educated, inform, and transported his audience to a time in history that is hard to forget as it is to bare. The movie never slows down, even at 3 hrs and 15 mins., and the length is important to the films realism because of content. The Germans Nazis were methodical and systematic with their crimes against Jews and humanity. The more you watch this film the more you realize how important it is. Every now and then we need to be reminded that evil exists, and that each and every one of us has the ability to sacrifice what we have to save another from this evil, even if our original intentions were selfish.

            "content": "Schindler's List is a movie that dives into the deepest recesses of man's ability of evil to the heights of mans ability to be compassionate to other humans. It open with the true story of the invasion of Poland by the German's Nazi war machine. There we see Oskar Schindler, a man with hopes and dreams of making money in the midst of the beginning of World War II. Along the way, he makes inroads with leading Nazi military commanders that are able to help him with contracts and workers. He begins employing the Jews of Poland as his workers through his accountant Itzhak Stern, who is in fact himself a Jew.\nAs the Jews are moved from the Ghettos of Poland to the Krakow concentration camp, Mr., Stern uses his position to hire as many workers from the Jewish population as he can. When it gets to the point of the prison being ready to shut down in 1944 towards the end of the war, rumors of shipping out the Jews to Auschwitz begin to circulate. Mr. Schindler, through movement of compassion for the Jews, realizes that he can use the money he has earned to buy the Jews and have them work for him instead of being shipped out.\nThe climactic, and human part of the story, is seeing  life from the perspective of the Jews who were help in the concentration camp and the daily embarrassment and humiliation they faced daily at the hands of the SS and the camp comandant, Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes). The brutality and attempt at mass extermination of the Jews is put on display for the viewer in utter and complete detail. \nShoah is the biblical term for destruction and, in the case of the Jews, a reference to what occurred at this time period of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis in Europe. The total and complete attempt to wipe out the Jewish population at the hands of the Nazis seems to play into the hands of this term. At the same time, it also seems such an insignificant word to ascribe to the murder and genocide of 6 million Jews.\nAt the end of the movie, Schindler realizes that he could have done more to save 10 more, 2 more, even just one more and regrets his inability to such. Mr. Stern, after typing out the list of 850 names that Schindler bought from the Germans, says \"The list is an absolute good. The list is life.\" The pivotal and heart wrenching wonderful scene is at the end when the actors portraying their roles in the movie, accompany the actual survivors to the tomb of Oskar Schindler and pay their respects to a man who showed compassion. It is estimated that Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews from the gas chambers. Today the generations of those he saved is estimated at 7,000 because of his love.",

Spielberg did a wonderful job; of course he had help, the fantastic cast and photography helped the creation of this epic.\nLiam Neeson's Schindler is very human, and you can identify yourself with the character. He's ambitious, but he never gets what he wanted: to be rich. He moves to Krakow, Poland, to take advantage of the situation, and be a success businessman, the Jews were under increasing pressure from the Nazis. He was very opportunist, selfish, and manipulative, at the end of the film, he becomes a totally different person. Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern is also amazing, he's a very strong character, a character that you can feel compassion and, you hope that he can be fine by the end of the film. That's one wonderful thing in the film, you care about the characters, even if is for a brief moment on screen, like the little girl with the red coat.\nThe photography is stunning, all black and white, like a documentary, you feel like you're watching a History Channel's documentary, but, more real and with an amazing direction.\nIn conclusion, Schindler's List is a great film about war, and one of the bests films Steven Spielberg ever made. A wonderful epic that you can see a despicable man turn into a better person, which helped more than one thousand Jews from certain death.",

He refused to take a salary and all profits he could have made went to a Jewish charity.  He would have considered the proceeds \"blood money\".  To contrast this with Mel Gibson's greatest career take on The Passion Of The Christ, puts this into perspective.\n\nThe film may be over sensationalized certain characters (Amon Goth), but a strong point must be made.  Oskar Schindler was a hero, and the Holocaust was hell.\n\nThis is not a fun film, but a docu-tragedy of a dark period of WW2.  I wish there would be other films made to focus on other tragedies of WW2, such as the massacre of so many Russians at the hands of Stalin as he purged his people into submission.

Liam Neeson plays the lead role as a man who is a German that is running a factory where Jews perform labor in. Oskar Schindler's businessman is a Jew himself that is well acquainted to knowing how to run a factory. Schindler's associate is under the control of the Nazi's and is working while Schindler is keeping an eye out for him weekly to ensure he is not taken on a train elsewhere. One of the most moving parts of the movie was when Hitler took a Jew out to be shot because he did not make enough hinges for his liking at that point in the day, he would find things to shoot a Jew over just for the thrill of it. Helen whom is Hitler's favorite maid is the one who is giving information to Schindler about how he beat her, shot random Jewish people who were harmless, and gave her \"rules\" to keep her safe. Hitler then tells Helen although she is not a person in the sense of what is going on in the world that he just simply wants to touch her without thinking she is not a German and then slaps her and calls her a Jewish bitch for trying to fool him. The Jews are stating that why have a workforce of Jews when all the Nazi's want to do is end up killing them for any wrongdoings that they seek out. They perform a wellness physical to ensure which Jews are worthy and those that are worthless. The process is barbaric like. In April of 1944, ashes fell from the sky of the more than 10,000 Jews that were burned in Plaszow. This movie has given much consciousness to how deeply the Holocaust has affected modern day Judaism and the inhumane killings of the Jews. Schindler tells Hitler he will pay the utmost amount of money for his Jews. The Jews today who are descendants of those who were saved are known as the Schindler-Jews. It ultimately took six years for the war to end, the Jews were finally going to be freed. In Judaism today, Oskar Schindler is looked up to as a selfless German who did not see Jews as a lesser nationality but as one that can work just as diligently. In world religion today, the Holocaust has a profound attachment to the way the Jewish community views how strong knitted their religion is because of it. Modern day Judaism views this tortuous time as one that can be made into something that will bound their religion as one and each and every Jew can share that story of Oskar Schindler as a hope to all Jews today that survived the Holocaust and their descendants. \"For one who saves one life, he saves the world in time.\"",

Every time I see it, I am once again profoundly emotionally affected and reminded of the power of this story.\n\nThis story needed to be told, and it was told very well. It pulls you in, deeply. If you are capable of crying while watching a movie, you will cry at some points. You may start to ponder humanity, human nature, and the reasons for things. \n\nI was caught up in the stories of multiple individuals being told here. Some things play out the way you hope they will; some don't. As we know, millions of people were killed by Nazi genocide during WWII, but here is one story about how the actions of one at first reluctant hero can make a tremendous difference to the lives of many. It's a complex and touching story, an important one. \n\nPeople have asked, how could this happen? Many Germans said they didn't know what was happening or how bad things really were. \n\nWhat was one of the first things to go in Hitler's Germany? And in every dictatorship? Freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and freedom to openly express dissent without fear of punishment. When the only news is what the people in power want you to know, that's how people remain ignorant when something like this happens.\n\nConcentration camps like the ones depicted in Schindler's List were approved and authorized by Adolph Hitler, leader of Nazi Germany, decades ago. His top circle ensured that his vision of ethnic cleansing was carried out. Millions of people were brought to the camps, mostly ethnic Jews, kept in horrible conditions, and killed. Why? Ethnic hatred, intolerance for people of a different race, and a stirring up against those who are different. They were rounded up and shipped out, methodically, and brought to these camps. Those who tried to take a stand against Hitler's policies, in any way, were rounded up and harrassed. Many of them were also put into the camps to share in the Jews' fate.\n\nAny time large numbers of people are to be rounded up, should we look away? Should we say \"They asked for it\" or \"They deserve it\"? Is that what we should do? Should we not pay attention to where they go or what their fate is or how they are treated?\n\nIf you like this, I recommend watching Machine Gun Preacher as well as Hotel Rwanda, both stories of actual modern day heroes saving people from genocide. The world needs more heroes like this. Ask a Syrian Christian (if you can find one that is still alive).",

Directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg, it tells the story of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi Millionaire who spent every last penny he had to keep his factory a safe-house for the Jews during World War 2. Liam Neeson, now primarily known for his roles in low budget action movies, is phenomenal in his role as Schindler. Ben Kingsley shines as Itzhak Stern, a Jewish worker who helps Schindler operate his factory.\n\n\"Schindler's List\" is smartly shot in black and white. The black emphasizes how dark and atrocious the events of the holocaust were while the white is the light of hope shining bright on Schindler for his good deeds. The only other color in the movie is the red in the jacket of a small Jewish girl, whose ghetto is being emptied with the people living there being taken to a concentration camp. Schindler later sees her dead body being carried away. Thus, we see that the red is a symbol for the unnecessary bloodshed and innocent lives that were lost.\n\nIt is important to realize that during the start of the war, Schindler's primary goal was wealth. He then saw the terror around him and decided to do what was best for humanity, not for himself. This shows that people can change for the best and one person can make a huge difference. Oskar Schindler lived the rest of his life in poverty, but it is hard to deny his status as a role model and a hero. This is a very touching story and a perfectly directed movie that commemorates the life of a man who unselfishly stood out from the rest to do what's morally right in the midst of a tragedy. In the final scene of the movie, when the war is over, Neeson is angry with himself for not  being able to save more lives. It is very hard as a viewer not to get emotional.  \n\nOskar Schindler is the reason why 8,500 innocent people are alive today, descendants from the 1,100 or so he protected during the war. He will never be forgotten.",

As an adult, I completely understand. Schindler's List is the true story of a German who at great personal expense, sheltered many Jews under the guise of needing workers for his factories.  In the first place, Oskar Schindler is not a saint. He is a swindler, womanizer and otherwise cold-hearted business man. Yet his humanity cannot allow him to turn a blind eye to the atrocities committed in the name of ethnic cleansing.  There is a point at which a Jewish worker tells a story about what happens to Jews who think they are getting a bath.

The actions of Oskar Schindler led to generations of Schindlerjuden, the term given to the Schindler-rescued Jews and their many descendants; now over six thousand Schindlerjuden are living today. Schindler's List was a necessary film in order to educate and remind the general public of historical events. Oskar Schindler serves as a figure of genuine inspiration to all of humankind.

His first \"R\" rated film is the heart wrenching true story of Oskar Schindler, the greedy and charming Nazi Party member who, after realizing the atrocities the party was committing, used his position as a German industrialist to save nearly 1,200 Jews during World War II. Neeson anchors the film as Schindler, lending depth and nuance to the portrayal of a man who started the war as a profiteer and ended it wracked with guilt over the lives he'd failed to spare. The direction is all Spielberg's POV camera work, but the accurately visceral violence and the tenderness for the victims of the holocaust is so genuine, you'd swear you were watching a Polanski or Billy Wilder film. Nazi films tend to veer towards emotional manipulation, but Steve Zaillian's screenplay haunting realism, combined with the black and white photography give the film an emotional resonance you'll never shake. Not exactly feel-good cinema in other words, but Schindler's List is a stark example of the extraordinary power film is capable of.",

Schindler himself was a part of the Nazi party, and he had been given a factory to produce military clothes, cooking items, and more. He didn't know how to run the factory, and received help from Izakh Stern (leader of a Jewish council), suggesting that he should hire the Jews over the Polish, because they are cheaper. Schindler follows Stern's advice, creating false documents, so he could have \"enough\" Jewish workers. This sneaky action prevented many of the Jews from being sent to concentration camps, almost certainly saving their lives. \n\nThe construction of a labor camp began nearby Paszow, with the killing of everyone who opposed in the ghetto. During the time of the killing, Schindler bribed an official so that he could build a camp for his own workers, in his mind; he wanted to keep them away from the guards, preventing any harm. He was also ordered to send all the remaining Jews away to Auschwitz, but managed to convince the same official to let him keep his workers, on the condition that he moved his factory to Moravia (outside Poland). Schindler's list includes Jews who have special skills, and almost all the Jews on his list arrived safely t his factory in Moravia. However, there were a few women and children redirected to Auschwitz by accident, but Schindler manages to bribe camp leaders and saves the children. Basically, he has spent a majority of his money earned in Poland to bribe officials, or leaders of camps. \n\nSchindler, as a German Nazi, had to flee from the Soviet Red Army and told his Nazi soldiers to return to their families, so they could avoid confrontation with the Soviets. The Jews give him a ring with the a quote, which means that he has saved a man and has saved the world, as well as a letter of appreciation for Schindler being the Jews' savior.  It was then given that the thousand Jews he had saved, brought up families, which amount over six thousand. It is really amazing how so many people were saved under the power of one man. Not only was the number of people saved stunning, but also to have a German Nazi save Jews is unheard of. \n\nObviously, the movie was very good from the start to the end, courtesy to Steven Spielberg. With great acting skills by Liam Neeson (as Schindler), and a very accurate representation of the events has made this movie prime during release, as well as in the present day. Based on a true story, it has been a touching, moving and suspenseful movie. It is recommended for people who love to watch movies related to humanity, or want to learn more about the horrible times of World War 2 and the Holocaust, 4.5 out of 5.",

It is a beautifully directed film, and with Steven Spielberg as the director, that comes as no surprise.  But it is not just Spielberg's steady hand that makes \"Schindler's List\" an amazing film; it is also the powerful performances of the cast.\n\nWhoever casted this film did an outstanding job because not only did they cast talented actors, but they casted talented actors who bear a striking resemblance to their real-life counterparts.  Ben Kingsley is great as bumbling, but likeable accountant Itzhak Stern.  Ralph Fiennes is excellent as ruthless SS officer Amon Goeth.  But it is Liam Neeson as the namesake Oskar Schindler who has the stand-out performance.  Whether portraying an angry Schindler or a kind-hearted Schindler, Neeson provides great emotional depth to the character.\n\nThis is such an incredible story.  In fact, so incredible, I was surprised to learn it is a true story.  It is of course full of truly sad moments.  But it is also full of moments of great triumph and joy, especially the touching ending.  This is by far the most bold, eye-opening account of the horrors of the Holocaust that I've ever seen in a film.\n\nWhen you hear the name Spielberg, most people think about his exciting films, like \"Jaws\" or \"Indiana Jones\".  But with \"Schindler's List\", Spielberg has proven he can direct a serious drama as well.  The film starts out slow, but once the story picks up, it becomes truly captivating.  \"Schindler's List\" is one Spielberg's best films, not only because it is an amazing story, but because of the people it honors.",

There was a a community of Jews that were hired by a a business man called Oskar Schindler. In the beginning Schindler was looking to increase his own personal wealth and social status by opening a new pot and pans factory, but he needed the help of some Jewish business men for the start up money of the factory. This lead to a agreement in the trade of goods for the money with the Jewish business men that lived in the ghetto. His Business flourished under a Jewish accountant that actually ran his business for him, and his factory became a haven for the oppressed Jews. During the money he had a change of heart and stopped caring about monetary gains, and became attached to all his workers... in the movie his workers got taken away from him and there destination was Auschwitz, but he decided to make a list of workers that he would move away to his home town to start a ammunition company. He paid out of his own pocket to save them thru the war until the Nazi army was defeated.\nWorld Religion\n\tThis movie also raises the issue of how evil can exist, and how can \"God\" tolerate the continued existence of it in the world that he created. This can be seen throughout the movie because so many innocent Jews died for no reason. The Nazi genocide against the Jews lead theologists to reexamine their traditional argument that punishment came from cause and effect. In other words that there sins would cause them to suffer and eventually lead them to the punishment we call the holocaust, but in my opinion \"God\" doesn't create evil and because of this he can not control it. The holocaust can be blamed on human hatred witch was rooted on race, language, and color of their skin. I will end this by saying one should never doubt \"God's\" continuing love for, and his anguish over, the human race.",

This is not the case however with the movie Schindler's List, what this movie does is it shows how accurate what was going on during Germany during World War II. It tells the story of the famous man Oskar Schindler, who was a member of the nazi party, and shows how the Jews were treated, the state of German Nazi politics, and the life of the Jews during the Holocaust. This movie is probably one of the most accurate movies of the Holocaust, along with it also being an outstanding movie as well.\nSchindler's List is filled with outstanding qualities that make a movie an excellent movie. The acting in the movie was very good,it was able to really sucks you into the story. As well as the director's choice of sounds and music to play along with certain scenes of the movie with the great acting really touches your emotions. The camera work of the movie was also very good as well, for this film being filmed in the early 1990's at the time it really showed good quality that you would expect out of a film from early 2000's. Part of the reason I feel why it looked so crisp was because it was filmed in black and white mostly similar to Wings of Desire. Now even though it is filmed black and white it does not take away from the experience of watching it, since it gives it a very eerie feel to it, almost as if you are watching something that you would not think is real like something from the twilight zone because of the horrendous acts that take place. \nOne thing that I really liked is the story it tells and how it ties everything together. It tells the story of Oskar Schindler who is a businessman that opens up a factory of making pots and pans for the Germans, and he uses the workers of the Jewish prisoners as free labor. Throughout the movie it shows mainly the life of Schindler through this time period and his opinions of the war and the Holocaust slowly change. This thrilling story of his life is quite interesting plus you have other things in the story as well that keep you interested.\nThroughout the movie you get a feel for what the Jewish people felt and what they were actually treated. It created a very accurate historical representation of not only the Jewish people, but also what the Nazi officers and germans of what they felt and went through. This is quite an interesting dynamic to the story going back and forth from both sides, since most movies only tell the story from one side mainly the Jews, this one is different since you end up kind of feeling for both sides. They really set the tone very well of how they were treated, from concentration camps to german soldiers storming the ghettos, this would set a very dark tone and creepy setting, like how you the guards would treat the Jews like rats instead of people and would kill them for almost nothing. The movie represents such an accurate representation that is brings chills, it was like actually sitting in a camp and seeing it in person of the horrors that took place there. But as I said before you start to feel sympathy for Schindler since you also see it through his eyes, so during the movie you began to care and feel for him as you learn more about his life, personality, history, and his character as a whole leaving you torn between two sides.\nOverall though this movie in my opinion was one of the best movies that have ever been created. It set the standard so high of what a movie that it makes great movies look mediocre compared to this. Even if you look just at the story it still is a very good movie, but you also have to factor in that this is not just a movie, it also basically put you in the Holocaust, it created such an accurate representation that showed the true devastation it had actually brought, and how we should never forget about what actually happened during the Holocaust.",

In the very first 10 minutes the words boredom and dull was replaced by the word excitement. I was excited  to see what this film had for me and it did not disappoint not even for a second. The one and only Liam nesson plays a character which is Schindler. I did not like him at first but loved him as the film went on because the development was spot on. Ben Kingsley's character was great and I loved the little well balanced comedic scenes between Liam and ben's character. This impression or the mood this film leaves on the viewers is astounding. I was both sad and relived at times in the film. Sad because of the sad video and relived because of how many schindler saved. Overall from its amazing black and white edit to its amazing story this is a must see film. Truly an achievement in cinema.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg has made many phenomenal films, but \"Schindler's List'' is his flawless masterpiece. It is a harsh and dramatic film about the Holocaust, and one man who is trying to save the Jews. It stars Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes.\n\nIt's set during the second World War. The Jews had just begun to be persecuted in Germany. They were forced to wear the yellow star to indicate they were Jews. Oscar Schindler (Neeson), is a German. He owns a factory that builds pots and pans. He sees the treatment of the Jews and wants to help them. So, he hires them to work for him at his factory. As the war continues, Jews are forced to leave their homes and go into the ghettos. Later they are sent to concentration camps where they are put to work. Many are slaughtered mercilessly. Others are gassed, killed on the spot, and eventually they are all burned. Schindler doesn't want to except that his people have become animals. However, when he witnesses the unimaginable animal like deeds of humanity, he can wait no longer.\n\nThe acting in this film is absolutely flawless. It is only fitting that Liam Neeson won an Oscar for best actor. His performance in this is probably his best performance in his entire career. The supporting role went to Ralph Fiennes, who also more than deserved it. Ben Kingsley, who did not win an award for his role, was also fantastic. Every actor and actress in the film was perfect. They all deserved awards.\n\nThe direction from Spielberg is strong. He is one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema next to Scorsese. He knows how to balance drama and war perfectly. He was able to get the best performances out of all the actors. John Williams and Spielberg have worked together on many projects, and once again Williams crafts a perfect score for this film. The music was so rich and filled with emotion. It added to the heart wrenching nature of the film. All the costumes are great, and the black and white cinematography is beautiful. Janusz Kaminski, the DP, really knows how to use black and white. It adds a timeless feel to the film.\n\nWith painfully real imagery and an emotional core, \"Schindler's List'' is one of the greatest films of all time, and it certainly is Spielberg's best. The production, cinematography, music, and acting are all flawless. It is one of the hardest films to watch due to it's true to life depiction of the Holocaust, but it is a fantastic film and worth watching. It is emotionally powerful and extremely compelling.",

It is more difficult to believe then when reading the facts that it actually was real, making the movie that much more impactful and terrifying. With scenes that even now (In comparison to what was cinema before) are still relentlessly shocking, Schindler's List is also the most respectful and tender homage to the Jewish community who suffered during the day. What is on screen is not pretty but is necessary. If it wasn't for this movie, but also if it wasn't for the book it is based on, Oskar Schindler would have dissapeared as the many he couldn't saved. Thankfully, Spielberg produced a movie that so amazingly celebrates the eternal hero that Oskar Schindler was. It is an essential masterpiece, a crucial addition to any cinephile's list.",

This is actually one of my favorite films that I've seen, and I seen this more than once despite the long runtime that's 3 hours long. When I see it for the fourth time in Holocaust class, and to this day, it remains to be one of the best movies that I have even seen. Liam Neeson is my favorite actor, and this is one of the reasons why he is because he gives a fantastically-layered performance that knocks his performance out of the park that makes me convinced that he knows how to do business, and understand his way that makes him want to save as many Jewish refugees as possible. He also does a good job of giving an emotional moment which at the end, makes it a very heartbreaking one but also giving an ambiguous question of if it would've been better if he went through time and do what he said. Ben Kingsley is great as he tells Oskar about what he can do that's the right thing, metaphorically as his conscience. Ralph Fiennes did a fantastic job of being such an evil character that he's just having fun with it, as he usually does like this and Harry Potter. This is probably the closest movie that understands what the Holocaust is like as people giving crap to Jewish people, what the Jews have to deal with in terms of living and working conditions, and even getting kids on the trucks which gets a lot of mothers trying to get them out of it, which is the most horrifying part of the film for me, even if I seen this before, it still  get chills out of it. The black-and-white shot is a wise choice and it makes it feel more effective and more of its time period, and the score by John Williams is relaxing, but very sad to listen to. It has the one aspect that many Holocaust films not use, and that is the humanism from Steven Spielberg that gives his vision that gives some humanity from the Jews that helps them get through with the Holocaust. Even when it's more than 3 hours long, I was never bored, it never felt stretched out, and it has great writing from Steven Zaillian that gives tons of informations of the Holocaust. The movie is very powerful, haunting, and just a masterpiece that World War 2 films are never up to this film, and so are tons of films in general.",

I feel as though everything that happened surrounding Hitler and the Nazi's and the killing of so many innocent Jewish people is cruel and it should have never gotten to that point. I chose to watch and review Schindler's List because I feel as though this is both a major historical and religious movie. The main movie takes place in Poland. The main plot revolves around a German business man, Oskar Schindler, who opens a factory making kitchen supplies during the time of Nazi Germany. He hires Jewish workers, which is free labor during this time. Then Hitler and the Nazi army start forcing Jews into concentration camps or killing them.  All of the Jews in Schindler's area of Poland are ordered to these concentration camps soon after this. A young girl comes to Schindler at his business and begs him to hire her parents because his factory is a sort of \"haven\" for Jewish people. Schindler starts to see that what the Nazis are doing is not right and he decides start trying to save as many Jewish people as he can. Schindler then begins to bribe the Nazi Soldier and that is when he creates his list and begins to use up his fortune and all his items to save the Jews. He was known as a hero by the Jewish people but a war criminal by the Nazi army. Overall, this is a wonderful movie and it portrays how one man is able to save over a thousand Jewish lives, at the risk of destroying his own. One man was able to see the wrong doing and stand up for what was right and protect the innocent people during this time. I would recommend this movie, especially to anyone interested in the WWII era and history.",

The films story line is a difficult subject to attempt but it is pulled off brutally yet elegantly.\n\nSchindler's List is a lesson in history without taking advantage of a delicate subject. Neeson, Fiennes and Kingsley give spectacular performances that are definitely career defining.\n\nFear enshrouds the film but the power of hope shines through.",

The cast are fantastically flawless, with Ralph Finese excellent as the evil colonel.

Reviewing this is like teaching a history college class its very adult strong theme, and human moral, and a beautiful story.\n                                                                                                  lets start this up with the setting, the setting is dark and cruel showing how harsh of a it was allowing death to be constant. The main thing to me is how complex this world is meaning there is always a problem the characters are face with and its not just external but internal. like the fact that Schindler is actually questioning the fact of saving the Jews even though the site of the madness sickens him, why because Schindler is just a business man and that's all he wants to be not the white knight who comes in and saves the innocent, the Nazi Commandant Amon Goeth (yes he was a real person) has the same issue except its more of should he be more kinder to the Jews rather then kill them inhumanly.\n                                                                                            thats where we get down to it the characters. these characters are one of the most accurate and none stereotypical characters in a documentary drama film. mainly just how human they are, yeah in a time period that is harsh there is human. Why do you think Schindler was questioning on saving the because he's human not superman even Amon also went through the same process but for some reason Couldn't change but that didn't mean he was all bad heck he even helped out schindler and even saved his butt both in movie and real life.\n                                                                                             The funny thing about this is that it was supposed be made in the early 1980, but Steven thought wasn't right for it so it went through seven directors then he did it, and the reason why he turned it down the first time was because he thought he didn't have mind set for it and we now know why that's a big deal. the Holocaust has very Humanistic point of views discussing race and that's what this film heads to. its not about the cruelty of life but about what it means to be human, what was in this movie was very accurate Schindler only thought the Jews as profit but after getting to know them and working with them plus he was against the violence used his company to saved them, and Amon actually kind of help out with that and even gotten Schindler out of jail twice for suspicion of that though Amon was executed for actually killing Jews but he did do some good and prevented Schindler from getting in trouble. which is why Schindler's list is my favorite movie.",

The film doesn't hold back on the violence and drives home how so many men, women and children were brutally murdered for no reason at all. The idea to film in black and white, as well as with handheld cameras give it more of a documentary feel to the movie and brings it to life more. John Williams also creates a score which is not too dramatic but enough to add emotion to a scene. \nThe acting should be praised immensely. Liam Neeson brings his caring side to Oskar Schindler but it is Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley that deserves the most praise. Fiennes as Amon Goeth couldn't be more evil if he tried. His arrogance makes him so alive and makes you believe you are watching the real war criminal. Something which to one of the surviving Jews would agree on as Fiennes came across as too familiar. Fiennes deserved his Oscar nomination but how Kingsley wasn't given a nominee is beyond me. You completely forget you are watching Ben Kingsley. He is so unrecognisable that you fall straight into the real Itzhak Stern. \nThere are some scenes which stand out and stick in your mind long after finishing the film. The ending being a particular example. Schindler's List is a film that will make you appreciate what you are so lucky to have.",

I wish Neeson would stop agreeing to these stupid fast paced action lone wolf warrior movies. The first Taken movie was amazing. Everything after is just rehashed rotten tomatoes. These are the kind of movies I would love to see him go after. I have mad respect for Liam. When I first encountered the \"Accountant\" I knew something was up but I...just..couldn't.....quite..put.....my...finge...OMG THATS BEN KINGSLEY!!! I enjoy seeing Kingsley on the big screen more and more. His range is phenomenal. The direction Speilberg takes the movie around the 1.5 hour mark threw me for a loop. I was not anticipating so much realism and emotion. Each gunshot left me open mouthed and wanting to reach out and help each and every one of these innocent people. Schindler's List made me realize for the first time, just how cruel the Nazis were during the war. Six million people. I'm still trying to rap my head around it. Its hard to talk about the ending without giving away any spoilers. But trust me, stay through to the end and Kermit may just find his way into the back of your throat as he did mine. Cheeky bastard that Kermit...And to think, the first time I plopped this movie into my bluray I let it play for roughly 10 minutes before turning it off. I, \"wasn't in the mood for a black and white movie.\" I will never make that same mistake again. R.I.P. Oskar Schindler!",

            "content": "Although I have always admired Steven Spielberg as a director, I had heard of, but not seen, SCHINDLER'S LIST... at least until now. Actually, I became inspired to see it just after viewing the shocking 12 YEARS A SLAVE, which, to this day, still left a mark on me. Perhaps because of this, I was surprised that I wasn't quite as affected by this film, partially because I had known beforehand about the stories about the Jewish holocaust in World War II than the plight of slaves. But that is in no way meant to diminish SCHINDLER'S LIST as a lesser film. On the contrary. It is a profoundly executed, moving picture (shot, interestingly, in black and white) where we are indeed treated to horrifying scenes of massacre on the part of the Nazis. Jews are banned from their homes, shot randomly at will, and worst of all, sent to cremation chambers. But the real emotional anchor of this film is in the development of its unlikely hero, one Oskar Schindler, an underhanded businessman who employs Jews to work at his factory... and, in a true act of self-sacrifice and compassion, compiles a list of more than 1,100 workers to save them from a grisly fate. Liam Neeson does an outstanding job in the title role, effectively conveying his transformation from a greedy moneymaker to a caring soul. Ben Kingsley turns in a similarly fine performance as his colleague, the Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern, while Ralph Fiennes recreates a chillingly frightening, unpredictable, psychopathic villain in Goeth, the ruthless Nazi commander who never once hesitates to target practice on his Jewish \"servants\" while lusting after another. One of the real gratifications of this film is seeing evil Goeth getting his comeuppance, but even more so is the message of how one unlikely man can rise to the occasion and make a difference. Spielberg has stated that making this film left an impact on him. It deserves every single Oscar it received, and I highly recommend it without hesitation.",

The final few emotionally powerful minutes of real-life Schindler Jew survivors, accompanied by those that portrayed them in the film, passing by Schindler's gravestone show just how much of an impact Oskar Schindler had on those he saved. Spielberg's unflinching direction, Zaillian's brilliant script, the magnificent performances, art direction and when exactly isn't a John Williams score amazing? Schindler's List is not just one of the best films out of the '90s. It's one of the most unforgettable films of all-time. There's no doubt that this was Spielberg's labor of love, his most personal film, and it shows with each and every single shot that passes by your eyes.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2014/02/25/benjamins-stash-8/",

Was it all just bribes and the right words? \nI was mostly impressed by Ralph Fiennes, and his portrayal of Amon Goeth.

The cinematography, general pacing, and acting are all of contemporary taste, so the colour scheme acts more as an indispensable coat of despair than as a reminder of the time period. Trust me, the subject of the Holocaust is enough of a reminder. No one will deny the horror that surrounds the Holocaust, not even the mad deniers. From my perspective, only hearing about it through history books, I have trouble in grasping just how atrocious the situation was. The need to bargain that things are better than they could be, the fear of one single slip risking your entire life (or worse, as Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), your life is taken away on a random whim), the lone wolf attitude such an environment dares to push onto you, despite such strong cultural identity in the entire community. Comprehending even this much is difficult, and director Steven Spielberg is aware of this. That is why he tells this primarily from the perspective of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a high-profiting factory owner whose membership to the Nazi Party does not interfere with a good relationship and trade with the Jewish community. For his ghost businessperson, he even hires a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley, who magically maintains arresting my attention, despite never breaking out of a timid, humble nature). There is far too much in the movie to touch on in what should be a capsule review, so I will say this: Schindler's List is not only the definitive Holocaust movie. It may well be the definitive Hollywood historical drama. Three hours and sixteen minutes, with not one minute wasted. That is not a miracle. That is craftsmanship, particularly in knowing when to change the lens.(i.e., character of focus) in a scene.",

He hence drastically separates himself from the commercial filmmaking, the same type of filmmaking he is so often associated with, with an emotionally compelling look at one of the stories in one of the most shameful pages of human history. Being Spielberg, however, the film is visually enriched by a wonderfully sharp stylistic approach with a great use of black and white photography that heightens its tension and at the same time seeks to update a classicist type of cinema. Occasionally, he does overdo the stylistic aspect and also the patronising elements that often show up even in the best of his more serious works. But both Neeson in the role of Schindler and a fiery and malevolent Fiennes have an imposing presence and share great tension in their antagonism that almost reveals them as arch-nemesis. In fact, it could be argued, that Schindler's List is so remarkable because it connects with a younger audience through its modern graphic novel approach that balances the serious undertones of the true story it recounts.",

            "content": "Schindler's List, by Steven Spielberg, is an epic film that tells the story of one man's life during the Holocaust and how his life impacted others. It opens with the lighting of two Shabbat candles and a Hebrew prayer. As the candles burn out the audience is taken to World War II and the Holocaust as we are immediately become part of a Jewish family signs the register confirming their Jewish standing; the single family transforms into many Jews waiting to sign the roster. Then, Oskar Schindler is introduced. He is a man focused on material possessions and his standing with the high Nazi officials. These relationships allow Schindler to learn of the impending orders regarding the Jews and Schindler immediately starts to ponder how he can make money from this tragedy. He begins looking for investors to assist him with an enamelware business to supply the army with needed goods. Schindler also figures out that he can operate this business with very little overhead because he can hire the Jews and instead of paying those cash, he can pay them with the product they produce. He opens the factory and employees approximately one hundred workers who he later labels essential workers to avoid them being taken from him and sent to the death camps. During the movie, the audience sees a major transition in Schindler's behaviors. He continues to appease the Nazi officials and keeps them quiet to what he is doing in his factory. Without adding spoilers, Schindler becomes a major proponent of the people who work for him and he, on several occasions, risks his own life to keep his workers safe. \n\nThis film quite accurately allows the audience to experience the traumas and tragedies of the Holocaust, people executed for being Jewish. This film is very true to the horrors experienced by people who chose to follow their faith in the face of death. The film's focus is the lives and deaths of the Jewish people; what they stood for in Hitler's views. The Jewish people were not viewed as equals, as humans, they were viewed by their religious beliefs; thus racism. Because the film is focused on the tragedies of this group of people, it is does not educate the audience about Judaism or the religion that defined them. The use of black and white film offers even more depth throughout the film; symbolically reminds the audience of the good vs. evil. For example, Schindler is presented as a greedy businessman who preys on the Jewish people for his own selfishness who transforms into a caring individual who had risked his own life for those he hired to help him profit. In closing, Schindler, through tears, says he wishes he had done more to save even more lives. At this point, one could ask if Schindler is questioning his life's purpose and his duty to God; a major focus of Judaism.",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Steven Spielberg's take on this historical event during World War II and the Holocaust is completely genius. The film was basically about a wealthy factory owner that saved the lives of hundreds of Jews during World War II by bribing other members of the Nazi Party in letting the Jews work in his factory, all while risking his own life. In my opinion, I think that World War II was a period in time when a lot of people were for the most part riding the bandwagon in reference to the complete hate for the Jews. As the war progressed and Jews were being forced out of their homes and publicly killed to spend anywhere from two minutes to two years in these concentration camps struggling to survive, people became more aware of what was actually going on behind closed government doors. The non-Jewish civilians who lived in these cities were influenced by the Nazi Party that these people were wicked and were depriving them of resources and supplies to fund this war against their allies; therefore they needed to be punished for that as well as not fitting into this \"perfect\" German race Hitler was trying to produce through mass genocide. People all over Europe became more aware of the horrendous acts that were taking place in the work camps and Jewish ghettos of course by the circulation of rumors through conversations soldiers and generals were perhaps having with their families.  However, those who lived closer to the camps than most would unfortunately be able to smell the stench of burning bodies, see the stacks of smoke coming from the crematorium, and the ashes that were produced as a result so they would then be putting two and two together and realizing that innocent people were being killed in these camps. In present day America and Europe, there are people who don't believe that the Holocaust ever happened. I believe that these people as well as present day Jews are becoming more aware the impact the Holocaust had on people because more people are coming forward and talking about their experiences and there is more scientific and historical evidence that has resurfaced that even the most logical person would believe. The impact that the Holocaust has on modern Jews for some is they become more committed to the practice of their religion and are more appreciative of the fact that they can freely live a Jewish lifestyle without worrying if they're going to be killed for practicing Judaism or just being Jewish. They no longer have to worry about being confined in crowded ghettos and forced out of their homes to be taken to camps where they would have most likely died.  On the other hand, the Holocaust may have impacted non-Jewish people because they now have greater insight on what the Jewish people had to go through during the war and may have a newfound appreciation for just being an American and never having to have gone through that type of inhumanity. As for myself I can say that I applaud the Jewish community for their strength and bravery during that time and still today likely facing anti-Semitic people.  This film relates to World Religions because it directly shows the most devastating historical moments in Jewish history and how the Holocaust still affects the Jewish community today. The Holocaust changed Judaism by strengthening their faith. The tests of faith as well as personal experiences in the Holocaust have been passed down throughout the years and used as a story indicating the struggle of their people and that the weight that was put on their religion has not broken them.",

Oskar Schindler seems indifferent to the suffering of the Jews until one day he witnesses a mass murder by gassing.  A little girl in a bright red coat catches his  eye.  He notices as the pretty girl is escorted into the chamber and later sees the girl dead in a horrid fashion on a wagon being carried off to the incinerator.  He all of a sudden realizes the depravity of what the Germans are doing to the innocent, and he begins to have a change of heart. \n\nHe first tries to keep as many Jews as possible on the \"useful\" list, as those who are not considered useful are sent to concentration camps to be killed.  He built more and more shelters for the Jews, bribed Nazi workers to send Jews to his facility instead the concentration camps, and he even allowed them to continue to observe the Sabbath.  Schindler works hard at keeping these expensive actions a secret from his colleagues.\n\nHis business partner, Goeth, feels very differently about the Jewish cause.  He detests them.  He is a monster to is Jewish slaves even going to his balcony to shoot them at random as they worked for fun.\n\nWhen the Nazis are close to losing the war and the factories are being closed,  Oskar Schindler feels like fleeing to avoid execution by the Russians, but the Jews protect him by giving him a document they wrote attesting to his benevolence and selflessness along with a ring with a verse from the Talmud engraved in it.\n\n\"Schindler's List\" is the most famous Holocaust film ever made.  It let us inside the concentration camps and gas chambers.  It gives us insight into the Jewish slave experience and front row seats to the most horrible genocide in the modern world.  We see Diaspora first hand as the Jews wander around after their release and we wonder how these people can possibly put their lives back together.

            "content": "Schindler's List was a movie, based on a true story, directed by Steven Spielberg.  It is a great movie, especially for people interested in history.  It is, however, graphic and not one for those with a queasy stomach.  It shows Jews being murdered by gas chambers, starvation, shot and overall abuse of the Jewish people.  \nThe movie is about a businessman, Oskar Schindler, who had a company which manufactured cookware and utensils.  Through bribery, he was able to obtain military contracts.  Schindler saw potential with the military contracts and later, with the help of a Jewish accountant, Itzhak Stern, got into the business of producing ammunition.  The products manufactured in Schindler's factories were not effective.  That was his plan, especially with the ammunition.  Stern convinced Schindler to hire Jews to work in the factory.  By doing this, he had skilled laborers he didn't have to pay and the Jews, as essential employees, were saved from the concentration camps.   It becomes obvious that Schindler has a conscience and wants to save as many people as possible.  Without spoiling every scene, I will say Schindler lost all his money, but saved over a thousand lives from the Holocaust.  The ending of the movie is very moving.\nSchindler's List was nominated for twelve Academy Awards and won seven.\nSchindler's List, the movie, ties in with Chapter 10 in our class.   The Holocaust or Shoah, whichever you prefer to call it, means \"whirlwind\" in Hebrew.  On pages 362 and 363 our book tells us how the Jews have always been targeted by Christian and Muslim religions.  Adolph Hitler and Nazi Germany entertained the idea of total extermination of Jews.  This was unheard of but part of the \"final solution.\"  Hitler hated the Jews so badly, he described them as a \"disease organism within the body of European society.\"  Before Hitler himself was destroyed, he along with Nazi Germany killed over a third of the Jewish population.  Our text starts to use theologian and philosophers' ways of thinking to show how and maybe why a God would allow such a tragedy.  Some would say it is God's way of punishing his people for not being obedient.",

Oskar Schindler is a man that is assertively desirous German businessman, who comes to Poland to gain wealth by using the Jewish people to work for him, and paying the worker cheap labor for their hard work.  Oskar Schindler has opened a trade good business for the Germans; these products are made for the German military for cooking the Nazi army food.  Oskar Schindler soon attains a contract with Ithak Stern. Ithak Stern asks Oskar to hire Jewish people instead of the Polish people because he can pay them less money, this arrangement left the Jewish people without any money for their work. If the Jewish people were not registered, nor have a work card they were loaded upon a train and transported without their belonging. The guard were telling them that their belonging with be sent soon, but they were taken by the guards, searched, and take took possession of the Jewish people money, jewelry, and  the teeth was pulled for those that had gold in their teeth, and their photos were all dumped into piles as well as their clothing. In 1943 the Nazis put to death the Jewish people that lived in the ghetto that protested against them, elderly, sick, and the people who did not cooperated with them even children's. While all of the killing was going on Oskar Schindler watched from the hill that he was on while riding his horse. The sight of so many people killed had a deep impression on Oskar Schindler. Ithak Stern is also taken, and locked up, Oskar Schindler visit him to see if he is alright, and tries to find a way to get him released unto him. \nOskar Schindler wanted to find a way to keep his workers safe, so he bribed Goth to allow him to build a camp outside of the city. Goth was order to exhume, and destroy all the bodies in Krakow ghetto. Goth was also told to disassemble the Paszow, plus take everyone else that was alive to Auschwitz.  Oskar Schindler pleaded with Goth to allow him to take his workers to Zwittau-Brinnlitz in Moravia. . Goth has consented to remain silent about Oskar Schindler transaction to have his worker sent to him, but he charged Oskar a large amount of money for each one of the Jewish people that were to be boarded into the train. Stern tells Oskar Schindler where to find the SS support list, and all the information about their black-marketing contacts. Stern and Schindler puts together the list called the, \"Schindler list. When the Jewish people arrive in Zwittau-Brinnlitz Oskar announce that the women and children have already left and will be there shortly, but the SS supporter is trying to prevent them from leaving. The train that the women and young girls are on arrives in Auschwitz, they are focused into the building, the guards start to cut their hair and make them strip off all of their clothes. Oskar Schindler arrives and talk to the SS supported that is charge and get permission to load the women and children onto the train, but before they can leave a couple of the guard tries to take some of the children as prisoners. Oskar Schindler stops them and tells them that he needs them to work because their hands were small enough to fit inside of the shell casing; the guard releases them and orders them on the train. \nOnce Oskar Schindler and the Jewish women and children arrive in Zwittau-Brinnlitz, he tells the guards that under no circumstance are any of his worker killed, no interference with production, and no guards will be in the plant without is authorization.

However the film does have a suitably sombre aura which helps the great (for the most part) acting to stand out. It's just too much like an American sitting at his desk in Hollywood trying to tell a sad story to an audience who don't want to know every detail and that is what stops it from being a classic, again in my opinion.

In the backdrop of this absolute evil, our hero is not without guilt. He is a Nazi party member, an unabashed adulterer and war profiteer. But when history gives him the chance, he chooses to pursue an absolute good, the saving of a thousand innocent Jews from certain death. And this absolute good, pursued to the cost of his entire fortune, redeems him of all the other ills he had accumulated over his life.\n\nTo give this idea life, the story's main plot is that of Schindler saving the Jews. To show the cost of this success, another plot tracks his fortune which is given up to save the Jews. Two other internal plots depict the morality of Schindler and Goeth. To make us experience the idea, absolute evil is given a face, a personality and a humane charm. The choices Goeth and Schindler make highlight the inner battles that must be won to strive for the absolute good.\n\nThis story is so powerful, it's meaning so relevant, that its experience is almost beyond words. This is why movies should be made. Its special resonance comes from the fact that given the ideas of such absolutes, the hero and villain are not depicted as black and white. The same story could easily have veered to a didactic history lesson, instead it is a shared experience that makes the world a better place by reminding us of what the human species is capable of doing to itself.\n\nMy Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",

This is a timeless film that will go down as one of the greats, as Spielberg's true masterpiece. After tirelessly researching and reading and reading and reading about the epic sadness that is the Holocaust, after a while it lost its impact on me. When I first learned about it in school I went home and read everything I could about the subject. I cried for all the victims. But after years of studying it in school, it felt like just another tragedy that was forced into my brain every day. Not until I watched this movie did I truly feel the suffering through their eyes. The horribleness and loss cast upon millions for nothing. But I also felt a great hope. Through Schindler's eyes I saw tragedy, death, destruction, and a beautiful hope. That no matter how utterly terrifying life can get, there can be a savior. A savior of a life, or thousands. The epic run time may threaten you, turn you away. But believe me, without it, you wouldn't have gotten such a skillfully crafted film.The beautiful score by John Williams brings to life the suffering, the black and white color scheme somehow makes the powerful film even more so. Incredible acting by Neeson, Fiennes, and Kingsley bring depth and raw emotion to the characters, making you feeling always enthralled. I cannot find a  single error or flaw in this film, and it will stay in my favorites forever.",

            "content": "Schindler's List Movie Review \nThis movie was a very interesting as well as emotional. Originating from a true story about a gentleman named Oskar Schindler. He was a greedy German factory owner during the Second World War; he exploited the cheep Jewish labor just to put more money in his pocket. As Time goes on Oskar becomes sympathetic to his workers, he sees the pain and suffering that they are experiencing every day. He became a Jewish Humanitarian and save over 1100 Jewish citizens from the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Oskar went from being a greedy man to a penniless man who saved lives. \n\tThe Impact of this movie on modern Jewish and Non-Jewish thinking in my opinion shows that not all German people in the WWII ear were all bad people. That all humans are equal not matter what. When the suffering of another person is in your hands I strongly believe human nature will kick in and saving those people to the best of your ability is the only logic. The Holocaust was a very strong part of the world's history and has everything to do with religion. The impact of the holocaust of on Judaism is even bigger. Creating these movies for us to see and basing them off of true stories bring awareness to the modern generation. People Suffered because of who they were. The lesson here is that just because your religion is different from mine or your skin color is different from mine doesn't mean you are any less of a person. Oskar came to realize that in this movie. He chose to save, rather than destroy. Making the Modern Generation aware of the tragedy of the Holocaust is very important. It promotes diversity as well as an understanding of what these people had to suffer.",

            "content": "About time I got to this film. This film had been on my watch list for years, waiting for the Blu-ray to come out before I got my first look at it, but never bought it. So I finally got it online, sat down in my theater room, put it on and watched it. And god. This film was near perfect.\r\n\r\n   Schindler's List is about Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Nazi living in Germany in charge of factory workers. He and his jew friend Itzahk Stern (Ben Kingsley) gather up a Jewish workforce involving a group of individuals who were bound for doom, but are now saved by pay and work because of Oskar Schindler. But Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a member of the SS-police force enters into his business venture and into his town, where he takes controls and starts persecuting Jews like never before. For Schindler and his Jews, life gets more and more tough, resulting in deaths, losses, pain, and loss of faith... \r\n\r\n   Liam Neeson gives an excellent performance as Oskar Schindler, one very moving and heartwarming as I remember. One of the last scenes lets him stand out as a spectacular actor, and should've given him the Oscar he was nominated for and deserved. His performance from a man who's mind was set on riches, to a man who's mind was set on saving lives is excellent, and could not be done better. Ben Kingsley stands out to me the most from the film. When I learned that Ben Kingsley had played Isak Stern, I had finally regarded him as one of the greatest actors of generations. The way he immerses himself into a character of such calmness and such willingness with being silent most the film, makes him an excellent actor and one to be given plenty of Oscars. I can understand he was not given a nomination for Best Supporting  Actor because he is simply playing the role of Ghandi, but switched around as a serious Jew, but still, when a man can go from Isak Stern, to the Mandarin, you know you have an amazing actor. Ralph Fiennes also gives one of the best performances I've seen of any Nazi, rivaled only by Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds. You feel such strong hatred for this man, and you just want to kill him right there. He fully makes you angry at any Nazi alive, but I'll get back to that in a bit. The performances from the rest of the cast were also very good, particularly the Jewish children involved in the film. Their sense of fear and confusion is fully realized as you watch the screen, and you feel as if these kids are hopeless, and that nothing is left for them. Their facial expressions bring pain to your heart as you watch the film, for you begin to feel as if there is nothing left for them.\r\n\r\n   The writing for Schindlers list is also excellent, as a beautiful adaption from the book Schindler's Ark. It provides the perfect mixture of humor, grief, fear, and anger as the dialogue unfolds. The main star, though, of Schindler's List is clearly Stephen Spielberg. As a director who has made Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., and Jurassic Park, you would never expect a film about the Jewish Holocaust to arise from him. His choice of black and white to film, and shots of color at times, such as the girl with the red jacket, is brilliant and provides a true sense of believability within the movie. The symbol of hope the girl with the red jacket brings as she lasts through the danger and survives many horrifying moments in the film is fully realized through Spielberg's eyes. Also, his choice to bring the real life survivors of the Holocaust at the end of the film is amazing, and proves this film is not just for Oscar bait, but rather is a documentary to teach people that this is real, and that reality should be fully understood and believed.\r\n\r\n   My only problem with this film, though, is that it's very one sided. As we watch, we understand not to persecute and hate as the Nazi did the Jews, but in the end I feel a sudden hatred for the Nazis. It doesn't make much sense, as we watch the film feeling a strong anger toward the Nazi troop, not understanding their anger toward the Jews. But as the film continues, we never understand that MOST the Nazi's only fought and killed because it was their job (Ralph Fiennes, on the other hand, is a different story). As a film with a strong moral message, I felt it came out as hypocritical, teaching us never to hate, but in the end we feel hateful of the Nazis.\r\n\r\n   No film has ever made me cry, not even this one, but this is the one that brought me closest to it. It was so emotional, so fully captivating and so sad, a film that will leave you speechless. Acting is superb, writing is spot on, and direction is amazing. Not any films come out unflawed in the telling of a tale, but this one certainly did. Although the film sends a message through hypocritical execution, this film was absolutely brilliant. No film will make you feel more sad, be more angry, and feel more moved as much as this did. But the ability to send these emotions to a viewer through the simple act of rolling a film and putting it on a screen, gives this film the highest honor of how a film should truly be. For this reason, it makes it onto my Favorite Films of All Time List, giving it a grandeur mark as one of the best movies of all time, and one of the best movies that can ever be made. This film makes you feel a way nothing, not even the people around you, can sometimes, making it stand it up as a timeless, excellent example of a strong, moving, and overall, superb movie. 10/10",

            "content": "Simply reading a history book or learning about it in school can paint a picture in our minds, yet it's not until we see images that we truly have a realistic impression of a situation.  In the case of World War II, so many events took place over a six year period that no film could ever fully do any one event justice - realistically, they can only give us an impression or an idea of how it may have happened.  Recently, films such as Red Tails, Defiance, and Valkyrie have all attempted to tell a specific story about the many events taking place during World War II.  Some films are better than others in the wide ranged war-telling genre, but regardless of quality, the point of entertaining while informing viewers about the past still remains.   And, there are few directors better than Steven Spielberg, the director of the1993 classic, Schindler's List - one of the one of the most heart-wrenching wartime depictions ever brought to the big screen.\n\nIn Schindler's List, Liam Neeson stars as Oskar Schindler, a businessman (and member of the Nazi party) that takes advantage of the invasion of Poland by the German army.  Once in Poland, Schindler uses his money to bribe Nazi officers, thus allowing him to take over a production facility - where he heavily profits from the production and sale of army mess supplies (using Jewish workers).  In order to run the business, he persuades a member of the Jewish business community, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey) to manage his books and finances.  However, once the Nazis start forcing Jews into ghettos, Schindler witnesses firsthand the senseless massacre of Jews - by SS officers, like Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), and becomes sympathetic to their struggle to survive under the Nazi occupation.  With his newfound wealth, Schindler does all he can to maintain his partnership with the Nazis, while protecting his Jewish production workers.  Embeth Davidtz, Caroline Goodall, and Jonathan Sagall also star in supporting roles.\n\nThe film's focal point, Oskar Schindler, serves as a neutral figure turned protagonist.  When we first meet this man on screen, he cares more about money and women than what's happening around him.  It's not until he sees the (now famous) girl in the red dress that he has a change of heart about the Jews.  However, he is smart enough to protect his Jewish workers in a legitimate way, while still appearing to be loyal to the Nazi party.  On the other hand, the antagonist - Nazi officer, Amon Goeth, was an uncontrollable madman with a license to kill.  Unfortunately, Nazi officers didn't see what they were doing as malicious or unethical - but rather a cleansing of the population.   And, once again, Spielberg carries out this daunting portrayal with exasperating perfection.\n\nWar films are notorious for getting it wrong.  For examples, look no further than Pearl Harbor or The Patriot - two films that cared more about the historical backdrop than telling a true story.  Obviously, those two particular films came way after the release of the critically-acclaimed story of Oskar Schindler (showing how backwards film-making has gone).  One of the many reasons this is such a widely praised film is the fact that Spielberg cared more about telling a true, realistic story than anything else.  The correct story always starts with the correct cinematography - and while cinematography is a technical term that doesn't always fit into a date night review, it has to be the starting point here.  In this particular film, an effective documentary style of filming is used - not to mention in black a white, both of which would be correct to their time period had this film been shot in the early 1940s. \n\nThe Nazi camps had to be recreated for the film, but they were done in close proximity to the originals with the majority of filming taking place where the actual, real-life events took place.  These camps give viewers a small taste of the absurd, malicious conditions that the Nazis forced their captives to endure until the end of the war - assuming they survived that long.  Not only did Spielberg succeed in bringing these work camps to life on the big screen, he also gives a very real depiction of the Nazi officers - who were allowed a great deal of leeway to eliminate Jews as they saw fit.  If a Jew rested for a moment while they were supposed to be working, they were quickly executed with prejudice.\n\nSchindler's List is a film that can't be praised enough and there's very little doubt this is a film that deserves to be written about extensively - not via a short film review.  Regardless, this film - along with Saving Private Ryan, are collectively Steven Spielberg's finest directing achievements and honor those that were lost in World War II>",

            "content": "If there has ever been a moment in film history when portrayed historical events are as deeply transmiting and as emotionally transforming as the events themselves, as philosophically endearing as a life of sacrifice, as complex and powerful as the men living it, that's when the art medium is at its pinnacle moment. \r\n\r\nThe unmistakeable grandeur of ''Schindler's List'' is the reason why I love movies. This is a film that doesn't care about a straightforward plot, or about its characters as elements to propel a story. This is the definitive proof that cinema does not ought to worry about the same concerns in other mediums. Indeed, what Steven Spielberg has captured, in such an expert and masterful way it is beyond any description, is the very essence of the Holocaust and the definitive argument of a racist ideology conceived to mutilate mankind. But more than that, Spielberg and his brilliant crew and cast have taken a picture of one of the most complex processess in human history, and by far the harshest event of the 20th century. Being able to keep all of that in film, using no other elements than cinematic language, is what makes filmmaking itself so unique and distinctive compared to other mediums. This is a film with a world within it. With an entire universe of philosophical and historycistical power taking place solely on the other side of the screen.\r\n\r\n''Schindler's List'' tells the story of a German industrialist who arrives at Poland during the Nazi occupation of that country, to invest in factory buildings meant to produce military items for the continous war effort abroad. Nonetheless, after meeting the uncorruptible accountant Ikshat Stern (Ben Kingsley), Schindlers grows aware of the depravation to which Jewish are submitted, particularly during a brilliant 30-minutes scene depicting the liquidation of the Jewish Ghetto in Krakow. After witnessing first-hand the events, Schlinder decides to save as many Jewish lives as he can listing countless Jewish people to work in his factories, without them being the littlest apt for manufacturing. Befriending the sadistic and ruthless Nazi captain Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler becomes involved with the operations conducted in the Plasz\u00f3w concentration camp. These are thoroughly depicted in the film, with a recreation so realistic it cosmically surpasses the standards of any pseudo-documentary by National Geographic. Working along with Stern, Schindler writes his list of competent workers he means to save from being transported to Auschwitz, to keep sheltered in facilities where they would supposedly work in war machinery until the German war front was broken and the Second World War over... or until his funds collapse from bribing SS officials and buying the machinery they were supposed to build from other companies. Oh, it ends. The war ends, of course, with the Allies winning. Being declared an enemy of the human race due to his Nazi-member status, Schindler flees shutting down his factories after hearing Winston Churchill's war victory speech. He leaves with the blessing of his 1,200 workers, all unmeasurably loyal and grateful to the blessed man who saved them. Unaware of his accomplishments so far, Schindler is given the last most beautiful works I've ever heard: ''He who saves one life, saves the world entire''. He leaves Europe completely broke. His only wish, to have saved more lives. The epiphany moment, having Schindler mourn over what he considers to be an act of incompetent unresponse, not being able to save at least one more life, desperately craving his possessions and go back in time, is the scene I found most devastating of an already devastating film. After being liberated by the Soviet Red Army, Schindler's Jews go across their shattered nation with the sun over their heads. Fast-forwarding time, they walk over the beautiful hills of Jerusalem to visit Oskar Schindler's grave. \r\n\r\nNo need to say this is the most beautiful film I've ever seen. I will most likely change that consensus sometime, and what sort of movie buff would I be if I didn't. But the point is, this is a film that has artistry and speechlessness on each it lasts. And it lasts more than three hours. \r\n\r\nThe film's story treatment itself has a lot to account for contribuiting elements. Some might say it's its depiction of the Holocaust which are ''Schindler's List'''s very essence. I, in particular, found its veracity and amorality much more meaningful than any other Holocaust memorial I've seen. This is perhaps the best dramatization ever made of the event, and also its very best depiction. However, I believe the most impressive things about this film are its two heartbraking unstoppable ulterior forces. For one, this is the best use of cinematography in my experience. The reason for that is its vision, which is at the soul of filmmaking. Being able to express merely with images what a book does in hundreds of pages, is the heart of cinema. The recurrent mottifs working throughout the movie, including the innocent red-dressed girl walking in the occupied ghetto and then being thrown into a giant pile of cadavers to be burned. One of the earliest scenes, that include Schindler selecting about fifty secretaries to work with him, is another masterful use of photography, cinematography and editing. Or the most brilliant bit of visionary filmmaking I found in it, which is the sardonic literary comparison between a scene that has Goeth trying to desperately shoot a Jewish worker with a dozen guns that don't seem to work, but him being condemned to die by hanging years later, only to find that no mechanisms for him dying are working, and the executioners have to kick his supporting chair for some time until he succumbs to the rope. It is the most beautiful irony ever. \r\n\r\nNo doubt being saved for the mastery of its screenwriting, music is the other trait I consider most relevant. The undescriptibly genius John Williams captures the ontology of the Jewish people in themes that might as well last one minute. Dozens of classic Jewish, Polish and German songs being used in some of the film's most difficult and hurtful moments. In a good tone with ''Schindler's List'''s depiction of the Holocaust, the images and their companion songs are meant to teach. \r\n\r\nIn 1993 was released one of the best films ever made. If not, then the most rewarding boldest film ever made. With no resource other than a purely visionary cinematic source, this is a film realisation on its very essence.",

Not only is it the best depiction of the Holocaust, but its black-and-white style, its dark depth and its exploration of the strength of the human spirit remain unforgettable in all viewer's mind.

Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson is a fascinating character in himself, playing a charming, manipulative and genius businessman taking advantage of a regime he does not believe in order to make a lot of money. With a great supporting cast from everyone involved including Ben Kingsley as the Jewish assistant to the sickeningly twisted nazi monster played by Ralph Fiennes. There is nothing to criticise in this movie except perhaps its length - which I believe was completely necessary to do this movie true justice. Even the idea to film the movie in black and white was genius.\nThe only thing that makes this movie even more remarkable is that this is based on a true story. Oskar Schindler actually existed  and many of the events in the movie actually happened. During the final credits seeing the decedents of the people involved in the true story was very emotional for me - after already watching a very emotional movie.\nMy recommendation. If you have not seen it - Go and watch it right now.",

I watched this movie when I was a child and have seen it more than a few times since then. The Holocaust is one of those topics that can be talk about for days in and out, as to the point where some people actually believe that it did not even happen which is somewhat ridiculous in my opinion, but to each its own I guess. Schindler is a local businessman who has a sole purpose of earning money and that is basically it. He is a member of Hitler's Nazi party and ends up opening a factory that makes weapons for the German army during World War II, and being that wars are very expensive; it was not a bad idea in a way to earn money especially if that is just your \"sole\" purpose. He basically ends up having a change of heart which is very heartwarming, and creates the factory to be a safe haven for the Jews. He even goes as far to bribe Nazi's and high ranking Nazi officials so that he could save the lives of Jews throughout the war. I think that him realizing what he was doing (playing a part in genocide) and him having a change of heart is not only remarkable, but is something out of a fairytale movie. This movie is amazing, and what makes it even more amazing is that it actually happened in real life. Obviously religion had a major part in what was taking place in this was and strong belief systems were incorporated on all sides of the table. The Nazis had their own belief system which was opposed to not only Jews, but other religions and races as well. This was a great movie and I am sure that teachers all over the world still show this to their students.",

Schindler uses these factories as a safe haven for the Jewish people in the Holocaust. Amon Goeth is a ruthless SS Lieutenant who is heartless, kills at his own whim, and he kills indiscriminately. Schindler has to make sacrifices in order to keep his factories going in order to keep them as a safe haven for his workers. He has to bribe Amon Goeth in order to build a sub camp for them instead of them being sent to a concentration camp. As the Jewish people are starting to be sent to concentration camps, Schindler does whatever it takes to stop his workers from being sent there. He pays Amon Goeth an outrageous bribe for each worker. A train of  female workers are accidentally sent to the Auschwitz concentration Camp. Schindler then bribes a camp commander with a large amount of diamonds.

He deservedly won the Best Director Academy Award, for the film is so artfully made and emotionally transcends the silver screen barrier and becomes part of one own horrible reality for over 3 hours. War profiteer Oskar Schindler (Neeson) enlists the aid of Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Kingsley) to open an enamelware factory in Krakow in the midst of the Nazi invasion of Poland, but the arrival of nefarious Nazi commandant Amon Goeth (Fiennes), who has no qualms over executing Krakow's Jewish population, sparks the humanitarian side of Schindler, who then decides to pour his fortune into saving as many Jews as possible. Neeson is really very good as Schindler, and Fiennes is equally good, but absolutely chilling as Goeth. Then, there is Kingsley as stoic Stern, absolutely beautiful performance. Janusz Kaminski's black & white cinematography, often shot documentary style, and Michael Kahn's editing work in concert to create some of the most spellbinding sequence of images committed to celuloid (both Oscar winners). Kudos also to John Williams' hauntingly beautiful score (also an Oscar winner).",

Like many of Steven's other films this movie was far from disappointing. I am glad it did not live up to the stereotypes of religious media. As a non-member of the Jewish community it is hard to believe that such a massacre occurred. The film takes place during the Holocaust and the Second World War. Oskar Schindler, a optimistic business man believes can create wealth off of the war. He starts a company in a factory which he acquires by bribing an SS official. He is very deceitful. He hires an accountant to help manage business. His accountant decides to hire Jews because they work inexpensive. Jews at this time was living in cramped spaces in ghettos and in fear of the Nazi's. The Nazi's were operating concentration camps used to mass murder the Jewish people. People were killed by the hundred and thousands in gas chambers, ovens, or they were shot. The Jews were eradicated regardless of their age or gender, whether they cooperated or not. Schindler witnesses the massacre has a change of heart. He becomes friends with guard  and bribes him to protect the Jews in his factory. Schindler builds a sublevel in the factory where he hides to Jews. He has compassion for the Jews, he encourages them to still practice their faith. The Jews are diligent to Lord and they observe the Sabbath. Schindler's secret costs him a lot of money. As the war takes a turn for the worst the \"Final Solution\" which was Nazi 's plan during war to annihilate the Jewish people. It was a complete disregard for human life. The Jews were being treated like insects they had been reduced from people. Schindler makes a list of particular trained Jews who need to be saved. The people on this list are saved because he gives away his entire fortune. Even when he has no money left he is still bargaining for as many lives as he can possibly save. Schindler is eventually seen as a profiteer of the Nazi Party. It is clear from his interactions with the Jews that he is far from that. He decides to flee and leave Poland. Even as he is leaving he still is compelled to save the Jews. The Jews give him a letter explaining that they are grateful for all he has done for them. He still is overwhelmed with grief and he feels like he should have done more. Amon Goet is later executed in the film. The devastation after the war is great. There were less than four thousand Jew remaining. Schindler's list contained eleven hundred names. In one of the last scenes of the film Schindler reads a letter that says \"Whoever saves one life saves the entire world.\" The main idea behind this film was to showed treatment of the Jews during the holocaust and how they overcame.",

            "content": "Schindler's List is an amazing film that follows the life of Oskar Schindler during World War II. The story begins in 1939 in Krakow, Poland. The movie shows how Jewish members of the community were living a great life prior to the war. Shortly after, these same Jews are forced into a ghetto. At the same time, Oskar Schindler moved to Krakow to attempt to make money off of the war by creating pots and pans for the military. He hired Jewish people from the ghetto as cheap labor to increase his profits. Because these Jews were employed by a member of the Nazi party, they were spared being sent to concentration camps elsewhere. An SS officer arrives on the scene to turn the ghetto into a concentration camp. After everything is set up, the officer begins the massacre of Jewish people within the ghetto. He begins by separating those who are sickly or old, and these are the first to die. Schindler happens to see this beginning and he is sickened. Schindler begins to work with the SS officer to make sure his employees are saved, keeping a list of everyone who should be kept out of the camps. Even when the SS officer receives orders to have everyone shipped to the infamous Auschwitz camp to be killed, Schindler pays massive amounts of money to have them kept there to work in his factory. The movie continues to follow Schindler and his Jewish workers, until the end of the war. Following the war, Schindler away with the blessing of all of the Jewish people he kept alive throughout the war. \n\nThroughout the movie, many references are made about how Jewish people were considered scum. The SS officer over the camp in Krakow takes one of Jewish women to be his \"slave\".  In one scene he refers talks about how she is not even human, implying that Jews do not even deserve to be classified as people. This was how many people viewed the Jewish community during this time, despite having lived and worked hand in hand in the times prior to the war. It was disturbing to watch how the holocaust actually probably played out during World War II. The aftermath of the Holocaust caused many people of the Jewish faith to question God. Living Religions quotes Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel as saying, \"Why should I bless Him? In every fiber I rebelled. Because He had had thousands of children burned in His pits? Because He kept six crematoria working night and day, on Sundays and feast days? Because in His great might He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, and so many factories of death? How could I say to Him: \"Bless art Thou, Eternal, Master of the Universe, Who chose us from among the races to be tortured day and night, to see our fathers, our mothers, our brothers, end in the crematory?\" (Fisher, 268). To know that the events of the Holocaust occurred not so long ago is unbelievable. I would like to think that today's global society is much different, however, genocide is still a reality that many fear daily across the world.",

He travels to Germany with the plan to open a factory that makes pots, pans, and a variety of other essential items of life. He plans to exploit wartime during World War II to sell and distribute his products better than ever. He recruits hundreds, if not thousands of Jews to work for him because it's the cheapest labor he can find. He uses these Jews to push his goals, but ultimately something stirs up. Throughout various times, the Nazi party kills off some of his workers, gradually this comes to eat him up inside, along with various strangers calling him a \"good man\" for creating a safe haven for Jews in his factory. *SPOILERS* Once the killing starts to escalate, he becomes worried of his workers. He writes a list of all of the Jewish workers he can remember, and bribes many Nazi officials in order to save nearly 1100 Jews from being gassed and brings them to a new factory he has built in Czechoslovakia. Here, he spends all of the money he has earned to keep all of his workers alive until the end of war time. According to the movie, there are thousands of descendants alive today.\n\nBecause I am writing this for my World Religions class, I'm briefly going to discuss how this movie ties in with Judaism. This movie is a shining example of the awareness that the Holocaust brought to the identity of Jewish people today. Millions of innocent Jews were murdered because of the Nazi regime. This made many Jews question their belief structure, with thoughts such as: \"Is our God good?\" or \"How can an omnipotent and caring God allow this to happen?\" Many of these questions are open to interpretation, but this is just one of the major examples of a horrible event that helped define the modern Jewish identity. Many non-Jews may pity the Jewish population because of this film and the knowledge of the Holocaust in general, which may also affect how people view the Jewish population.\n\nThis is a great film explaining the work of Oskar Schindler, and how he can be an example that many of us should try to follow today (although not in all aspects). I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a passion for history or a good drama film.",

To sum up the plot of this intriguing movie that shows the horrors of all of our pasts, not as commonly mistaken just the Germans, Oskar Schindler sees a quick way to get rich during WWII. He starts by bribing his way through the ranks of the Nazis. He becomes well established and develops an accord with the Nazis. He uses the Jews, that are by this time housed in the Ghetto of Poland to run his factory. The man that is taking care of the financial running of the factory is the Jew Itzhak Stern, wonderfully portrait by Ben Kingsley. Itzhalk Stern is using his influence over Schindler to help some of the Jews to avoid deportation into a concentration camp. Schindler is aware but chooses to ignore this. His concern is money, and Stern is making a lot of it for him. Schindler witnesses injustices and cruel treatment of the Jews by the German soldiers, but still ignores all of this. The final solution for the Germans arrives and all  the Jews are deported to a concentration camp or killed immediately. Schindler sees the men, women and children being slaughtered. He uses his inflluence to have some of his workers be allowed to remain working for him. He does not however get to keep Stern. Stern is now being used by the cruel concentration camp commander Amon Goeth. Schindler is beginning to see that this is no longer just a money making scheme for him. He is now emotionally involved. He sees that he needs to act quickly to save as many Jews as he can. He buys them from Amon Goeth, who he has won over. In the end he saves 100's of Jews.\nThe movie brought additional awareness of the injustices that have been put on the Jewish people for thousands of years. It shows how we as humans with just a little push can condemn a whole religious grouping. We all need to share in the responsibility of not only what happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany but also over all the past  centuries. It seems that we see the Jews as our scapegoats anytime something goes wrong. We however are not God and do not get to decide if His chosen people need to be punished for not obeying His laws. We can never allow ourselves to forget the horrors that occurred.\nWe can never let anyone doubt that this did happen. Our hopes need to be this an atrocity as this will never occur again.",

            "content": "This is one of the most challenging films to review.  Not because it's complex or difficult to follow, but because it is quite simply one of the most intense films I have ever seen and the level of emotion is...quite unlike most movies of today.  \n\nWidely considered Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, Schindler's List is a powerful, utterly devastating and raw glimpse at the horrors of the Holocaust.  It's also a profound character epic, transforming a man who prides himself on leisure and his bountiful fortune into one who sacrifices it all to save the lives of many.\n\nThe first element of note is the phenomenal cast.  Liam Neeson leads as Oskar Schindler, and is tremendous.  A real, raw, and emotional performance.  Ben Kingsley plays Itzhak Stern, a troubled Jewish accountant who helps Schindler in his character transformation.  His performance is also incredibly genuine, ever representing some of the best casting in film.  Rounding out the fantastic cast is Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a sadistic psychopath with nothing but hate for the Jewish people.  It's an awesome cast that carries emotional weight and intensity, but written with that signature Spielbergian style.  \n\nRight off the bat, you can also see the Schindler's List is in black and white.  This visual style is striking and refreshing and adjusting to it is remarkably easy.  The way the film is shot is more intimate and personal as compared to other Spielberg outings, and the black and white really augments the experience.  The sets are recreated with such incredible attention to detail; Everything from the Ghetto at Krakow to the terribly disturbing Auschwitz, Spielberg simply doesn't take you to these places but puts you in them, creating a sense of tangible immersion in these places.  John Williams also composed the score for Shindler's List, and is among one of his most original works to date.  Straying away from the big and boisterous action packed scores he usually composes, the score for Schindler's List is a more subtle and emotional score, and I was taken away by the beautiful music (the theme is especially memorable).\n\nBeing a Holocaust film, Schindler's List has no shortage of intense grit and violence.  It's worthy of note because of the brutality of it all, recreating some of the darkest moments of human history with nothing held back.  I cried more than a few times during Schindler's List because of these scenes; it's so emotionally poignant and it gets the point across with almost blistering intensity, and if not for the transformation of Schindler the entire film would fall apart.  But because of the striking visuals, intimate and strong performances, and that Spielbrgian branded style, Schindler's List shines as a near-perfect balance between intense violence and story.\n\nI will say that Schindler's initial transformation seems rather sudden, but when between the rock and the hard place that Oskar Shindler was in I can see his change of heart.  Other than this seemingly dramatic change of character, This film is a masterpiece.  \n\nIt's all just so incredibly disturbing, powerful, emotional, intense, and violent that Schindler's List becomes ingrained into your mind.  And that's a good thing.  While all films that win Best Picture are credible in their own right, I can safely say that Schindler's List rises above most for one simple reason: Schindler's List is an important film.  In a time when people are denying the Holocaust even happened (for some foolish reason), Schindler's List is a graphic and raw recreation of an event in history that should never be forgotten.  Brilliantly casted, well conceived, directed, shot and tremendously powerful Schindler's List is a masterpiece film that, now in 2013, has stood the test of time and will undoubtably remain a classic for ages to come.\n\nBlu-Ray Review: Picture quality is surprisingly good, with only one or two moments with obvious visual flaw.  The audio is as good as it can be.  It isn't laser sharp, but isn't distracting either.  In terms of a remaster it's awesome.  The packaging is in a nice collectable box, and a 3 disc set (2 DVD's - parts 1&2) and 1 Blu-Ray.  Digital Copy included is both iTunes (gladly it's HD) and UV.  \n\n5/5 - A classic",

But the ending is one of the most heartening things ever shot on film, and a beautiful tale of survival, hope, and the cost of human life.",

Plus, he has such an on-screen chemistry with Liam, it's amazing.\n\nSpielberg deserved the Best Director Academy Award like few directors have.",

I'm glad I watched it, this was really gripping and an emotionally steering film. But as difficult as the subject matter might be, the overwhelming message of self-sacrifice, unity, courage, hope and the enduring strength of the human spirit to stand up for what is right even through overwhelming odds, slightly overshadows any negativity in this film. I mean everything that happened is still very tragic and horrific but at least, there was a great example that in dark times like this, people are still capable of choosing to do what is right and that's a heart-warming message and gives you a good feeling that maybe there is still hope for humanity; that some day we can hopefully learn to look beyond divisive (and unimportant) aspects of ourselves like religion, economy, skin color, gender and see that we are all human beings and we all have the inalienable right to life, love and happiness, as long as it doesn't impede another person's right to life, love and happiness.

All three leads are magnificent, especially Fiennes in his most well acted role yet. The depiction of the concentration camps is raw and gritty, not glazed over and stylized.

Spielberg sets a horrifying and hopeless tone to this film, which fits the jews emotions perfectly, but where this film is made is in the screenplay that makes it a thought-provoking and an allegorical study of the whole Holocaust. The screenplay also sets the stage for the good acting performances by Neeson and Kingsley, but it really creates a monster in Amon Goeth that represents the Nazi's motives for doing all of this, and Ralph Fiennes depicts him with the utmost complexity and egotism. Fiennes should have, 100%, won Best Actor in 93 over Hanks in Philadelphia.

The characters of Oskar Schindler and Ammon Goth further make the story come alive serving as a sharp contrast to each other. From the beginning this film opens in black and white making you realize there is something special here. With Speilberg behind the camera, Liam Neeson takes on the role of Oskar Schindler. Historically, this German industrialist aided over a thousand Jews from the Holocaust. Neeson skillful portrays his character revealing the turmoil and peril Schindler faced. The cast is rounded out nicely by Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes. The film effectively moves the viewer to ponder humanity and also causes us to praise Schindler. Fittingly the movie closes with many surviving Jews laying flowers on the grave of their savior.",

            "content": "\"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\" - Torah\n\"The list is an absolute good.  The list is life.\" -  Itzhak Stern\n\nThis and Jaws are my two favorite movies of all time.  This is a truly amazing film, that is just so meaningful, and hard not to love.  It is a tough movie to watch because it very accurately depicts the holocaust, concentration camps, and how Jews were being massacred everyday.  I have talked about Spielberg's genius for the range of emotions and how real he makes everything feel in my reviews for all of his films, but this is the one that is the most emotional and most real.  My parents told me that when they saw it in theatres everybody was crying at the end and they were so emotional that they just sat through sobbing throughout the credits.  That reaction shows you how much of a genius Spielberg truly is.  The reactions he gives people like how people were scared to go in the water after Jaws, and this film, and how everybody felt sick after the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan.  Absolutely amazing.  Spielberg's bets historical movie is a hard one to review, but I tried my best.\n\nOscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a businessman who never succeeded in his business.  He arrives in Krak\u00f3w hoping to start a business as a war profiteer.  Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) is the first person he goes to.  He agrees to start the business with them.  At first Schindler is a really self-absorbed man, who only cares about making money off of them.  Once he witnesses the liquidation of the ghetto, he starts to go through some character development.  He starts to change and realize what is really happening in the world.  He then decides to spend all of his money to bring over a thousand Jews into his new factory so eh can save them from being killed.  The film is the greatest example of character development of all time if you ask me.  To transform from this super selfish man into a total hero.  Another thing he fixed about himself is that at first he was a total womanizer that was always cheating on his wife, and he stopped for her.  He saved over a thousand Jews and now over 6,000 Jews are alive today because of him.  He was one of the all time greatest heroes in my opinion.  This was Liam Neeson's most fantastic acting for sure.  Most of the stuff he does I love, and he is just awesome.\n\nThey relationship between Schindler and Stern develops a lot over time.  At first it is strictly business, and Stern hates Schindler.  Schindler was just using Stern to help him run his business.  Stern wanted to get, as many Jews as he could in the factory, because he knew that the Nazi's wouldn't touch them if they worked for own of their own.  Schindler just wants to make money off of them, and he gets mad at Stern for what he does, because that is dangerous and he knew what would happen if the Nazi's figured that out.  The Jews all want to work for him because nobody gets killed who works for him.  Eventually Stern realizes that Schindler is a good man, and they become friends.  They write the list together.  Their relationship is incredible and they have so many hard scenes to act out that they pull off beautifully.  That was one of the best parts of the film. \n\nAmon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) was a really evil and insane man who ran the concentration camp in Krak\u00f3w.  He would shoot people from the balcony of the house that he lived in that overlooks the camp.  He became good friends with Schindler, and he would give Schindler people from his camp to work in his factory always for a price.  Goeth would kill Jews for fun.  During the liquidation of the ghetto he was smiling and laughing at the Jews.  He was hung in a mental institution years after the holocaust for the murder of so many Jews.  Ralph Fiennes did a phenomenal job portraying him.  His character had no personality, and was just insane and evil as it gets.  He also gained weight for the role, however Goeth was even heavier in real life.  He thought of himself as some god or ruler.  They really develop his insanity a lot, and they make you hate him more and more.  The fact that you hate him so much shows how great Ralph Fiennes played that role.  He is a great actor, and this was his best performance.\n\nThis film is such a hard film to make.  To make it historically accurate, and to make it as emotional as it was is truly something that only Spielberg can do.  The film is so realistic and everything that happened was so awful that it had to have been so difficult to film.  It had to have been an incredibly hard film to act in too, because the acting is so intense, and emotional.  It's films like this that truly do draw a line between good and great actors.  Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes are so amazing.\n\nSomething that Spielberg did with this film is only show one person in color.  The whole film is in black and white except you see this one little girl in color wearing a red jacket, and you see her again when they are burning the corpses of the Jews.  It is one of so many interesting things Spielberg has done with his films during his career. \n\nThe Nazi's had a four-part plan.  First they stripped all of the Jews of their rights.  Then they forced them all to go live in the ghetto, and let Nazi's take their homes.  Then after a while they liquidized the ghetto. At one point you see a man who is obviously a really wealthy businessman being forced to move out of his home and into the ghetto.  His house is give to Schindler.\nThe moved the Jews into the concentration camps after the finished building them.  In the concentration camps they would humiliate the Jews by making them run around in circles naked with each other, men and women together.  They would mock them and laugh at them while they were killing them.  The most heinous treatment of people you could imagine was towards the Jews from the Nazi's.  If one person were to stop working for a second they would get killed.  Sometimes they would get killed for no reason at all.  The film really put the holocaust in perspective for me.  It showed how much evil, bravery, and heroism there was during the worst thing that ever happened in the world.\nOnce they started losing the war they started to just kill them all.  In the end the whole thing lasted about six years, and over six million Jews were murdered.  Oscar Schindler saved over a thousand lives, and due to generation there were over six thousand people alive because of him.  That only adds up to the year the film came out in 1993.  There have probably been at least a thousand more people that were born over the last twenty years.  Thousands and thousands of people are alive because of him, and the number will continue to increase.\n\n\nThe Jew's had to do many things to help themselves survive.  During the winter they Nazi's started killing anybody who got sick, so what they did was prick their fingers and squeeze out one drop of blood.  They would take that drop of blood and rub it on their faces so they would have color on their faces and they would look healthy.  When they would take the kids away to be gassed, many of the kids hid in many places, but the ones that survived hid in the porta-potties.  They jumped down through the toilet hole, and hid in all of the waste.  It was disgusting, but it was life or death.  The Jews that survived were all very clever.  Some of them sold things on the black market.  Oscar Schindler got arrested a few times in real life for buying things from them.  They weren't allowed to have money so that was the only way they could make some.\n\nNot only are you a genius to make a film like this.  You also have to have guts.  Most directors probably wouldn't want to make a film like this because of how you run the risk of offending people, and making the Germans look bad.  The Color Purple is another one that took guts to make because he really made the blacks look bad in that film.  When you make certain people look bad in a movie it takes guts because people will get offended, and they may criticize you.  This film's makes the Germans look so evil, and just awful.  To also make it so realistic could offend people too.  People were probably upset by what they saw in the film, but it really did give people perspective.  When he did Saving private Ryan a few years later people had to leave the theatre during the opening scene, because it was so intense and realistic that they couldn't take it.  Spielberg has the guts to do a film and do it right, and not worry about how people will take it.  He isn't like Quentin Tarantino (My 2nd favorite director) who is just super over the top, and has the most foul and offensive language, who probably doesn't care who he offends.  He does the most realistic stuff about some of the worst things that have ever happened.  That is why he is my favorite director.  Not just because of how many phenomenal movies he makes, but because of how he has the guts to make them as realistic and accurate as he can no matter how awful or gritty it can be.  He is the greatest director of all time for those reasons.",

His camera work in the film is unique. 40% of this film is used with a handheld camera. There were no steadicams or crane shots used. His efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! The black and white effect used only adds to the depression. The editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence. \n\nThe acting presented is amazing. Liam Neeson brings an Academy Award worthy performance to the screen. His transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous.\nRalph Fiennes is also great in the film. He plays Amon Goeth, an SS officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. A performance not many can accomplish.\nBen Kingsley is amazing portraying Itzhak Stern. He single-handedly makes my favourite scene in the film. As Stern figures out that Schindler is using his own money to rescue Jews, his face expression says it all. Very emotional. His reaction can't be described with words.\n\n\nThe Score in this film is magic. In my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. John Williams is brilliant!\n\nSchindler's List will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema.",

            "content": "The Holocaust was a tragic event in history and this movie portrays its atrocities everywhere. Steven Spielberg cleverly put Schindler's list together based off of Oskar Schindler's heroic actions during World War II.\n\nSteven Spielberg chose a very good cast to represent the characters within Schindler's List. Oskar Schindler, the protagonist , (Liam Neeson) and Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) work together to create a very powerful and memorable movie. Even Ralph Fiennes, who plays Amon Goeth a German SS Officer, does an amazing job though most of the time he incites anger and distain for what he does and represents. \n\nSchindler's list  takes place in the beginning of World War II when Germany invades Poland. Oskar Schindler, who is a German businessman, is trying to profit off of the war by recruiting Jewish labor to make him rich. Though later through the movie, Oskar goes from being greedy to helping the Jews survive by bribing Nazi officials. The remainder of the movie is Oskar trying to keep these men, women, and children alive throughout the war.\n\nSchindler's List  was expertly done in the way Steven Spielberg created this movie. He decided to make the movie into a black and white film with its own beautiful music. Making it in black and white really gives this movie a stronger meaning of how it shows its doom and gloom. This movie takes place over six years and I feel as though when I watched the movie, it didn't accurately portray the timeline correctly. Scenes just jerked forward in time. Towards the end of the movie, I really didn't see how it went from the beginning to the end. This movie is also very long. It is roughly 180 minutes (3 hours long) though in some spots it seems to drag, it makes up for it later by showing character progression.\nOverall I would highly recommend this movie. It's an emotional roller coaster in the way it's presented and it will keep you on the edge of your seat during parts of the movie. Besides the flow of time and how long the movie is, watch it.\n\nSchindler's List portrays the Holocaust in all of its gruesome detail. The Holocaust has changed the Jewish idea that God is always there willing to help those that believe. Many Jewish people today see the Holocaust as an unjust act set against them. The non-Jewish thinkers see the Holocaust as a tragic event and that most of them think that the Jews were wrongly persecuted.",

Also how they captured the hurt and anguish and plea for help in the Jews faces from the cold death heartless stare from the Nazi's it also disturb me that the Nazi's valued their religion just like the Jewish but treated Judaism as if it was just a made up religion that \"they\" created.",

            "content": "Schindlers list is a great movie if you are in the mood to reflect and be emotional... and a little mad. This story is about a man who makes his money off of the labor of Jews that were captured. He put them to work in his factory. He soon realized that he was keeping them all from being killed. He loses his fortune through helping them stay under his employ! This is a great film about learning to be selfless. I would not even be able to say that I would do what he did, but I pray I do! \nDue to the changes in tolerance and acceptance of Jews in modern society, movies like these seem to be reminiscent of issues of the past. I would argue that this movie is a view into the humanity of these situations. This man was forced to see the humanity of his situation and see past dollar signs, materialism, and success. He was forced to see an old man with a useless limb beg for a job to save his life. He was Forced to see people faced with fear and death simply because of what they believed and how they lived their lives! This may seem like something that could never happen again, right? \nThe reason this is so important is that with many of the mentalities that are present in government, religion, and society; this could happen again. This may not be on a grand stand, and they may not be aimed towards the Jews; but one must think of the Church shootings, suspicion of middle eastern people, and the persecution of gays and lesbians. An example of this may be the north Carolina pastor that stated that gays and lesbians should be put in an electrified fence. He then stated that they should all be allowed to die out there. Sound familiar? http://charlotte.cbslocal.com/2012/05/22/pastor-build-electrified-fence-for-gays-so-they-die-out/\nThis is a masterful work of art to show the other side of condemnation. The pain, agony, fear, and desperation. This film shows us exactly why respect for all walks of life is important. This film shows us that a mentality of hatred that is unchecked leads to horrible consequences like these.",

The movie was both heart-warming and heart-breaking all at the same time. The best part was it was a true story about a man and his transformation about the value of life. This movie was the perfect example of how it only takes one person to make a difference. Changing for the better and leading an example for a lifetime. It was breathtaking to watch Mr. Schindler go from greedy to giving his fortune away to save his friend and employees from the Nazi's and the concentration camps. All the lying and manipulation Schindler went through to protect them from the torture that all the other Jews faced with this evil and risking his own life going against the other German's.  The scene where Schindler watched the round -up of the Jews in the ghetto from a far was something unexplainable. It broke my heart to watch the little girl in the red coat dip and dodge the Nazi's to go and hide and I believe it broke Schindler's heart as well. The scenes of the camps were awful and Goeth was evil with a capital E! How terrible was he to torture the Jews and I can't imagine how many more was like him through-out all the camps. He used the Jewish people as target practice for fun.  It was an excellent choice to film this movie in black and white with an occasional hint of color to express emotion. The music was dynamite through-out the entire movie. Shows how strong the Jewish people are with all they have been through since the beginning of time. I want one day show this movie to my children so they can see the beauty and the horror the world has to offer.",

The movie's main character was Oskar Schindler, which was a German man. He was wealthy and wanted to have more money by employing as many Jews as he could at a factory. The Jews would work for cheap opposed to other people. He was a very friendly man and it showed that throughout the movie. Even at the beginning he pays for other peoples drinks and food at a casual nightclub. World War II progresses and the tragic event called the Holocaust took place. Although Oskar was money hungry and seeking to get wealthier, he became sympathetic for the Jews in danger. He ends up saving a little over 1,000 Jews from suffering in the gas chambers and set his factory up as a refuge site. Even though Oskar wasn't Jewish, he still experienced first hand how horrid the Holocaust was. I always knew the Holocaust was a bad event, but this movie made me realize how truly rough it was. So many people were innocently killed and hurt for no reason. It was estimated that 12,000,000 people were killed. That is more than the population of North Carolina according to the 2011 census. Hitler targeted various types of people including homosexuals, blacks, and people he just did not like. It is amazing to me that something so terrible could take place. I respect Oskar because of how caring and helpful he was in saving the lives of so many people. It takes a lot for someone to be so courageous in a time of need. The movie was overall entertaining the entire time and very informative. It portrayed the terrible time well and the movie was easily understood. Everyone should be somewhat educated on the importance of the event that took place. I may show this to my family and watch it again.",

Schindler goes to a ghetto camp to make money for himself, but he also doesn't want to have to spend a lot of money on employees for his business. He wants looks and finds cheap labor to make him rich. He uses the Jewish people, the Jewish people that are being dislocated from their homes and soon to be sent to a concentration camp. \n     However, soon Schindler starts feeling remorse for the Jewish and what is being done to them. So although he at first refused to help try and save some of the Jewish people he later changed his mind. He helped save the Jewish people that he used at his business by keeping them out of the camps by convincing the Nazi's to let his workers be deemed as \"essential\" which kept them out of the camps and he also convinced the Nazi's to let him build his own camp for his workers this too kept them out of the camps that the Germans had made. Later in the movie Schindler finds out that the Nazi's are coming after his Jewish workers so he spends his own money to pay for the transportation to get them to his factory in Czechoslovakia. And this is where they are kept until the end of the war. \n     Today the Holocaust still holds many emotions for the Jewish people and all persons around the world. Most traditional religions like Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islamic religions all around the world denounce the actions of the Nazi's. These religions recount teachings that express love for other races and creeds of people as well as compassion. All these religions ask that we all look, explore and exercise our moral conscience.",

What the Germans did to the Jewish people was totally unacceptable. They treated Jews as if they were not even human, like their lives didn't matter, but my question is why? Who gave the Germans the right to decide if someone is worthy or not, no one did they were just being mean and cruel for no reason whatsoever. This movie was about the Holocaust and the treatment of the Jewish people by Germany. They moved them out of their homes and into a filthy Ghetto, then moved them to concentration camps and worse. While all of this was going on Jews were dying senselessly by the hands of the German army. One of the head persons in the German army was Amon Goeth and he was the absolute worst. Just killing Jews because he wanted too, that is until Oskar Schindler taught him about power and what real power is and that is how he saved the Jews that he did. Mr. Schindler knew that what he was doing for the Jews was going to get him in trouble but he did it anyway. He only went to Germany to make money as use the Jews to do it, but ended up respecting them and saving their lives as much as he could by coming up with a list of Jews to buy out of slavery basically. He bought them and put them to work in his factory making fake bullets and letting them live as human being and respecting their ways of life. It was honestly a beautiful site to see when he scolded the rabbi for working on the Sabbath. This movie shows how the German government at that time was cruel and evil, but it also shows that there were and still are good people out there. I'm glad this movie was made because the people of my generation and generations to come get to see how it really was for the Jews because yes I knew about the Holocaust and that it was terrible but to actually see it is a different thing. It makes us think about the greater good and how racist is pointless and stupid. This movie is a great learning tool for those who can take seeing all of the hatred that was shown to the Jewish community.\n\nThis movie relates to world religions because it is something that has affected a group of people all over the world. Jews were persecuted for so many years since the beginning of their existence and for what, there is no reason other than pure hatred.  Hatred of people just because they are different is wrong and immoral. I'm so glad that times have changed some what, I'm sure there are still some problems between Jews and Muslims over in the Holy land, but nothing like the Holocaust or even like the Exodus in the Bible. Now Jews can live peacefully here in the USA not be persecuted or even executed.",

Schindler makes his fortune hiring cheap skilled Jewish laborers.  In his factory the Jews are making kits for the Nazi army.  Not knowing much about the business he depends on a Jewish man by the name of Itzhak Stern; who helps Schindler get the workers for his factory in exchange for some of the profits.  During this time of war and turmoil the Jewish people were confined to a ghetto; the only time the Jews were allowed to leave was to go and work at Schindlers factory.  While the greater population of Jewish people are being killed on the spot or sent off to concentration camps. A new concentration camp is being built and then enters our next main character Amon Goeth.  Goeth is the overseer of the new concentration camp. When the new camp is finished the Jewish people that occupied the ghettos are sent to the concentration camp called Plaszow.  Before you know it Schindler befriends Goeth and bribes him into letting some of the Jews work in his factory so that he can still make money.  Schindler witnesses the killing of hundreds of Jews, and this has a ever lasting effect on him.  As time passes it is apparent that the war is not going in the Nazi's favor.  Goeth is then instructed to send the remaining Jews to Auschwitz to be murdered.  Schindler, with the help of his now good friend Mr. Stern puts together a list of Jews that he will attempt to save from death. Schindler moves his factory to his home town and he is taking the Jewish laborers with him. Schindlers plan to save the Jewish laborers almost goes off without a hitch, but the train that is carrying the women get mixed up and ends up at Auschwitz death camp. Again, Schindler uses bribes to save the Jewish women. When everyone arrives at the new factory it will take a lot of bribes to keep his plan in tack. All of the bribes has cost Schindler most if not all of his fortune. In 1944 or 1945 the war is over and what Jews that remain are now supposed to be set free. Schindler must now leave behind the Jewish laborers and flee the country because the Red Army is looking for him for profiting from slave labor. In a last stitch moment the Stern and the other Jews get together and write a letter saying that Schindler was a kind man that only tried to help save the Jewish people from extinction. They also made him a gold ring from someone's dental work.  Watching this movie was very emotional for me to watch. Jewish people that managed to survive this terrifying ordeal at the time of this movies creation had about six descendants of the Schindler Jews. One of the things that touched me the most was at the end of the movie when Schindler was about to flee; Schindler breaks down and cries. He feels like he could have done more and saved more Jews if only he had tried to sale his car or his gold pin.  Stern and some of the other Jews embrace him and try to comfort him. This movie is a small silver lining in a big black cloud that is the Holocaust. This movie relates to our text because Jewish people have been the victims of cruelty for centuries.  The people of the Jewish faith in history have been great in numbers. Just like the times when Jewish people moved to Egypt to escape famine; it was so many of them that the Egyptians felt threaten by them.  The pharaoh turned them into slaves and the set out to kill there baby boys. This incident and the Holocaust go hand and hand.  In my opinion Hitler was something like the pharaoh he hated the Jewish people so bad and they both wanted to do away with them.  I also think and this is a loose comparison, but schindler can be compared to Moses saving the Jewish people from bondage and helping them to the promise land.",

He dresses expensively and frequents nightclubs, buying caviar and champagne for Nazi officers and their girls, and he likes to get his picture taken with the top brass. He wears a Nazi party emblem proudly in his buttonhole. He has impeccable black market contacts, and he is able to find nylons, cigarettes, brandy: He is the right man to know. The authorities are happy to help him open a factory to build enameled cooking utensils that army kitchens can use. He is happy to hire Jews because their wages are lower, and Schindler will get richer that way. Schindler's genius is in bribing, scheming, conning. He knows nothing about running a factory and finds Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant, to handle that side of things. Stern moves through the streets of Krakow, hiring Jews for Schindler. Because the factory is a protected war industry, a job there may guarantee longer life. We also see the Holocaust in a vivid and terrible way. We are given a Nazi prison camp commandant named Goeth who is a study in the stupidity of evil. From the veran da of his \"villa,\" overlooking the prison yard, he shoots Jews for target practice. Schindler is able to talk him out of this custom with an appeal to his vanity so obvious it is almost an insult. Goeth is one of those weak hypocrites who upholds an ideal but makes himself an exception on it; he preaches the death of the Jews, and then chooses a pretty one named Helen Hirsch. to be his maid and falls in love with her. He does not find it monstrous that her people are being exterminated, and she is spared on his affectionate whim. He sees his personal needs as more important than right or wrong, life, or death. At the end of the film, there is a sequence of overwhelming emotional impact, involving the actual people who were saved by Schindler.",

My second criticism was of Schindler to have him break down in tears at the end was completely against his character, yes you could see he had learnt to love the jews along the way but it was too much to have him break down, only to one shot later be completely fine, it just seemed odd. \n\nA well portrayed story with too much extra context of the time put in to provoke audience feelings, the story itself would have been portrayed much better in half the time!

Spielberg depicted such cruelty in the Camps.\n\nA scene where a Jew who made hinges was moved from where he is working to go shove coal and then when he was done he returned, Amon G\u00f6th (Ralph Fiennes) queried him for not meeting up to his regular toll of hinges and immediately had him arraigned to be executed, for something that was not his fault. That scene touched me.\n\nThe movie was shot in Krak\u00f3w, Poland for seventy-one days. Shots were done in real life locations, though the P?asz\u00f3w camp had to be reconstructed in a pit adjacent to the original site, due to post-war changes to the original camp.\n\nThe plot of the movie is direct; a German businessman named Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) in Poland sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils, using bribes to win military contracts, and bringing in an accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory.\n\nHe then hires Jews for the cheap pay, but later after witnessing the cruelty they face in the Nazi Camps, he then tried to get as much Jews away from the Camps to his factory, using all his savings to take care of them.\n\nThe movie is not so bad when it comes to acting, but the main hat dipping should go to the Screenplay and the directing. The Screenplay and the script had to be perfect in other for us to be able to get the feel of what the Jews were going through. Also the directing had to be top notch so as not to get carried away by the suffering or the cruelty but to understand why a German will like to save the Jews.\n\nAlthough we know that much has been done by Liam Neeson (Taken), Ralph Fiennes (Harry Potter) and Ben Kingsley (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) over the years, but they will be fondly remembered for their role in this classic.\n\nTake a 3 hour break from your busy schedule and watch this movie. It is one of a kind.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "Some of our critics to accuse Steven Spielberg's artful prudence, first of all - that he figured his jewelry Oscar triumph. After all, \"Schindler's List\" won seven awards, including awards for the film in general, and for direction - so personally Spielberg as a producer and director for the first time won even two \"Oscars\", and before that only once, in 1987, he was awarded from the American Film Institute named honorary prize Erving T\u00c3\u00a4llberg for his film career.\n\nBut in predicting the success of a talented, including the commercial (\"Schindler's List\" has reached almost one hundred millionth foreign box office in the U.S. box office, and the world has received over three hundred million dollars, exceeding its budget by 13 times), there is nothing wrong if the picture is not only dedicated to important topic tragic murder of the Jews during the Second World War, but also to make a truly cinematic and highly artistic. By the way, Steven Spielberg to opt out of the fee, assuming that the person did not have to make money on this project, and considerable income from the tape sent to them in a specially created fund Holocaust witnesses, for which documentary record began recognizing those who still survived.\n\nThen the director of \"Schindler's List\" began to bring other criticisms: the \"aestheticization of violence\", \"Hollywoodization history\", agreeing even to the point that his film, skillfully drawing the horrors of destruction of the Jews, a \"vile and sordid\" repetition of the tragedy on the screen - and thus he supposedly replicates cruelty around the world. Like art in general is contraindicated image sorrowful events of history and the dark sides of human nature. But Spielberg himself was compared to negatively interpreted by way of Oskar Schindler, who allegedly desired to buy a new-found name of Christ. Although in this picture the Jews saved by Schindler, call him Moses, and, of course, no accident that we hear a phrase from the Talmud: \"He who has saved one life, saved the life of all.\"\n\nJewish ability to survive, and the existence of a Protestant pragmatism typical American victorious optimism could not irritate those who focused on imposed more than a millennium ago, the Byzantine understanding of the true Christianity, and hence the true religious existence. Since there is only valued sacrifice, selflessness and godly in deeds, and the question itself about the possibility of a deal with the devil for the sake of other people's lives - also \"from the evil one.\" But is unlikely to really care and Orthodoxy \"Magi of the art\", which are better preferred to think of Slavic prayazychestve and ineradicable Russian clowning. The tone of the arguments of the critics is cheeky and blasphemous - no matter what religion and morality are the words themselves do not belong.\n\nContemptuous rebuke addressed to Steven Spielberg, who dared to go on adventure spectacle to create epic tragedies in the mouths of our \"art in jeans\" became cocky shocking, does not hide the \"Bolshevik directness\" of the authors of articles on the \"Roll of genocide.\" Despite the veneer of hatred of the \"scoop\", they were all born and raised with Budenovka on his head, still have not gotten rid of his favorite childhood thoughts of heroism for a higher purpose for the overall victory, for the good of the people. And their deep dislike of \"Schindler's List\" is explained not only by psychological, aesthetic and market arguments of some critics.\n\nFeed Spielberg - the value of every life, irreplaceable individual, and even more so - the whole people, the ineradicable desire to survive in any situation and at any cost, even by a compromise with evil, personified in the form of, for example, Amon Goeth, commandant of the concentration camps. Deftly traded for Jewish souls German businessman Oskar Schindler can not but hate those who are used to understand the heroism as useless sacrifice of self - \"feeding into the breach,\" \"death by death\", \"dead shame no shame,\" \"die, but do not give up, \"etc. Schindler, a real person, has become a kind of messiah, as 1,200 people rescued from Auschwitz, although still killed six million Jews. But our victory in the war has cost far more than the loser to the Germans, above all - by the number of victims. And some began to seriously resent that Steven Spielberg did not want to somehow make a film about the extermination of tens of millions of Soviet people.\n\nBut \"Schindler's List\" - a story that \"wins survivor.\" Like the famous fantastically fabulous \"E. T. Alien \"(1982), a philosophical parable (though based on a documentary book to film adaptation that director did not dare to approach since 1983) on the possibility of alien contact between members of different populations, to help each other to find peace and quiet, House or required the \"promised land.\" That is why the final posters deliberately provoking the inevitable comparison with the old-fashioned Soviet films about the war, which only in the last scenes urged to remember the fallen.\n\nBut Spielberg's detractors have not paid attention to the fact that the final episodes of \"Schindler's List\" is, in fact, \"a parade of winners.\" The typical American happy ending marks, in actual fact, the triumph of the human and historical justice. And the survivors are rescued before the grave of one who rescued them from the camp. Surviving more dead, although they, too, need to mourn. Most importantly - more than a thousand lives were taken out of the clutches of the devil.\n\n\"Tragic Tale\" Spielberg feel free life-affirming. And so it confuses the minds of peculiar \"Budenovka boys\", who are trained from childhood to see on screen, stories of heroism unjustified, negligent and criminal attitude to life of every individual. Soviet class humanism was actually one of the most inhumane, including - in relation to their own people. And that he was abstract - in contrast to the west, facing the individual. From this point of view, \"Schindler's List\", named for a recent survey of the American Film Institute ranked eighth among the hundred best films in the history of the United States - one of the few genuine works of social realism, one that has a human face.",

He was a part of the Nazi party and he had many friends very high up in the Nazi ranks. Liam Neeson played the part of Schindler and I think this was one of his best roles. Steven Spielberg directed the movie. It won seven academy awards. I cried so much in the end.   \tMany Jews and Non-Jews really questioned God and their own faith after this horrific event occurred in history. Over 6 million Jews were murdered during this genocide. A lot of people wondered how God could, if there really was one could allow this to happen. And the only answer that seems to make any sense is God gave man free will to do right or wrong. And I think this movie showed that in the mist of the Holocaust, glimmers of God shown though in the way of people like Oskar Schindler. He could have been killed by the Nazi party doing what he did and he did it anyway all for the benefit of other human beings. He was arrested at one point but he kept on fighting for these people. He never gave up. He lied many times about unskilled workers such as kids or elders to be an asset to the factor. He even allowed his workers to pray in a minyan daily. He spent all of his fortune keeping these people safe. No one knows what Schindler\u00e2(TM)s motives were for saving all these people but he was once quoted saying \"I knew the people who worked for me... When you know people, you have to behave towards them like human beings.\" This movie touched my heart on a very deep level.",

But what really makes him such an impressive director is how emotional he can be. Schindler's list is the best movie in his filmography. Period. Its an impressive movie, bold in its direction and resembles a documentary more than a drama, partly due to its memorable and beautiful black and white depiction. I think that its realism is a testament to his skilled usage of all the parts he had in hand. He handled the characters with detail. Not only is Liam Neeson great in this movie, but all the extras who pile onto the trains with despair and horror is quite fascinating. The usage of 100's of people who speak no dialogue is actually pretty amazing. He handled the story with heart, teaching me more about the Holocaust than any other school documentary. Sure, he may be too sentimental in his movies, Schindler's List included, but you can't deny the emotion, honest , and love  this movie emanates. A rightful classic that has too many things to even write about here.",

It's also very well acted, quite memorable in some scenes and fantastic in its documentarian approach. However, it's way too long in its runtime and not that well paced. Also, I've never been emotionally involved here, which is highly problematic for a Holocaust movie. This is why I personally find it very good, but far from amazing.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg is the KING of empathy. What you have is a character film, where we see the change of heart in Oskar Schindler. This is done so effectively and smart, it sort of blows my mind. See, really good drama in films is usually ruined by the movie revealing important plot points about the character in the middle of the movie. Finding Nemo almost made this mistake by showing what happened to Nemo's mother later in the film. John Carter made this mistake, and that was just one of the attributes that made it a bad script. But when you reveal something early on like in Up, you have the pretense to make really effective drama, and I believe anything with a story is made 500 times better when it has drama. Steven Spielberg is not the greatest filmmaker of all time, but he's widely regarded as so because he understands this, and he creates drama by putting characters we like into difficult situations. \n\nOn paper, we shouldn't like Oskar Schindler. In fact, we should despise him. But there's something about the way Schindler is presented that makes us relate to him, and makes us understand him. I mean, he's a scumbag who's all about making money in the beginning, but there's something about the way he looks when he talks to his wife about his grand dreams, the way he does business to impress people, SOMETHING about this character is actually, oddly, likable (or maybe it's just me). \n\nThis makes the drama SO much more great. When we finally see Schindler laying down everything he's ever owned for other people, we're incredibly touched by it. See, critics may say that this film is overly sympathetic to Jewish people, and critics are missing the point entirely. The Jews were put into a situation where they weren't seen as ordinary people like you and me. The point the movie was trying to make is that we're all people in the end. We have to help and respect each other. It's not a singular message JUST for Jewish people, it's prevalent to us as humanity in entirety. \n\nI personally love this movie, and it's one of my favorite films of all time.",
