    "summary": "In this animated feature set in the 1940s, the troubled yet heroic Batman (Kevin Conroy) is pitted against a mysterious figure who is rubbing out Gotham City's most dangerous criminals, and who many believe is the caped crusader himself. Batman's alter ego, millionaire Bruce Wayne, is about to get married to the lovely Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany), who helps him recover from his need to avenge his parents' murder -- meaning that his crime-fighting days may be numbered.",

In many ways, this is like a prolonged episode of the animated series, yet manages to explore not only its main subject, but the other characters in under an hour and twenty minutes. A large part of this film's quality is owed to it being an animated feature, as certain emotions and sequences could've only been depicted in the artform, helped significantly by its score. As it was released in the 90s, it paved the way for the more grounded, serious portrayals of the Caped Crusader on the big screen we see in the Nolan trilogy from the tone, the characters, the hero's dedication to his moral code and this film deserves the praise.",

            "content": "Frequently held up as the finest of the Batman animated films, Phantasm is not only excellent, it's a key feature in the success of Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise. The influences on The Dark Knight (2008) especially are impossible to ignore, as a powerful criminal who is connected to an ex-girlfriend of Bruce Wayne accuses Batman of murdering a crime lord. Batman, obviously, is not guilty, he is spotted at the scene moments after a mysterious figure vacates. What makes Phantasm so important is the human struggle of Bruce Wayne, as we see him go through heartbreak in various flashbacks, as he is forced to confront his troubled past when it threatens his wellbeing and stature in the present. Another interesting development is Mark Hamill's Joker, sidelined to a bit part although still crucial to the story. Nolan's Dark Knight put the Joker front and centre, grinding Batman almost into the ground; but Phantasm leaves the Joker as an irritant in Batman's side, and focuses on Wayne's personal troubles. It makes for an interesting and effective story, and one that if we'd gone without, we almost certainly wouldn't have seen Nolan's trilogy in the same form as it is.",

They hold some info and reveal them later on, they didn't make this film only for a child audience.\n\nThe dark grittiness was well done, Bruce's issues and fantastic ending on the theme of Vengeance.\n\nI predicted who would be the Villain simply because I am also watching the series and they always explore villain side of the story. I really wanted that Phantasm to be that person and they got it right, no cons counted even if I knew.",

Maybe not \"The Killing Joke\" weird, but it is still weird to see cartoon Batman get it on (with another redhead too).\n\nThe story is weak, it completely feels like different writers than the 90's show were involved and created a story of which they are very proud, and then had the animation team handle it.  It doesn't feel like the same show, and has all the telltale beats of an average live action movie.\n\nCreating a new character like the Phantasm would be awesome if it was introduced in an episode and the story arc stretched out over a season, but to cram it an hour and half, it is such a cheap version of what it could be, I wouldn't have even bothered as it removes the option to do it correctly later.\n\nIt was kind of nice to see the Joker, but if you're going to have him make an appearance, he might as well be the focus of the movie.\n\nUltimately, any story that is more about Bruce Wayne than Batman outside the comics is just not going to be that entertaining.",

A sort of spin off of the Batman Animated Series this version of Batman is actually set in the 1940's (yet somehow may or may not connect with the universe it's too hard to really explain). The movie tells the early story of Bruce Wayne (Kevin Conroy) and his romance with Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany). It's sort of told through flashbacks about how he eventually becomes The Batman. Fast forward ten years later and Gotham city is under attack by the mysterious Phantasm a masked vigilante that is killing people and pinning the murders on Batman. It's up to Batman to figure out who this mysterious villain is and save the day. There's obviously more to it than that, but i won't spoil the good stuff. This is a nice tight well written story that has a fantastic villain arch to it all. I enjoyed this movie 26 years ago and still enjoyed rewatching it now.

The reveal of the phantasm is the worst of this movie, because it made no goddamned sense. When ever the Phantasm was near Batman they were about the same height, but after the reveal (Andrea) you realize she is about a half a head taller, or whatever height she decides to morph to since her height in the movie is so damn inconsistent.

I just love how he genuinely acts as a detective piecing together clues, and he flat out refuses to kill people. He also didn't have an artificial Batman voice that sounded like someone who had just finished gargling gravel, thanks to the superb work by Kevin Conroy. In fact, the voice work throughout the film was second to none, particularly Conroy as Bruce/Batman and Mark Hamill as the Joker. I also couldn't get enough of the score. Composer Shirley Walker did some remarkable things with the music and helped to intensify the atmosphere and also amp up the excitement of action scenes. I never watched the animated series (I haven't watched that many cartoons since I was a child) but the look of the film was solid. At times it seems a little too goofy, considering how dark they are trying to set the tone, but I think it gels fairly well.\n\nZack Snyder could have taken a lesson from Mask of the Phantasm to learn how to remind the audience of the death of the Waynes and what that means to Bruce. With nothing more than a picture on the wall and a visit to the grave we 100% understand without needing to see pearls falling to the ground again. However, the story-telling in Mask of the Phantasm wasn't always that solid and concise. I had some significant problems with the way the movie constantly jumped back-and-forth in time. If they were thinking about it more, they would have included a simple visual cue that would clue us into whether we were watching the past or the present. It's not a good sign when you have a film-viewer like myself being tempted to pause at the beginning of each new scene in order to figure out where we were in the timeline. The twist at the end is easy for most people to guess, but I didn't mind all that much because they cast suspicion on enough people that the reveal could have been different, so it was still a solid mystery.\n\nThere is a romance plot in the film which was necessary to the story, but I wasn't really convinced of their affection for one another. I think that stems from the fact that the movie skipped over some of the courtship moments in their relationship and just expected the audience to accept that the love was there. I was surprised that the movie left things relatively open and unresolved at the end, but I assume that was intended so that the story could fold back into the animated series. One opportunity that I feel like they missed was the chance to have Batman in a position where he's forced to defend the Joker. Because of his vow not to kill (or let people die) they had the chance to create a much stronger moment by putting the Joker's life on the line instead of Andrea. If Batman was given no alternative than to save his arch nemesis it would be marvelous. That's not to say the movie was bad for not doing what I wanted, I just saw the squandered potential for greatness. The film was a gem, though. It is definitely well-made and I'd say it's better than at least 3 live action movies starring Batman.",

When I first heard of it, it was from a YouTube video where the Joker has his well known laugh, and ever since then, I wanted to watch the movie, but however, it wasn't in a rental store nor the city library. So I got impatient and just buy it on Amazon, and got it about a week later. For their first film that's part of the animated series, I really enjoyed it. The voice acting is fantastic as I really believed that Kevin Conroy is really Batman, and Mark Hamill is Joker. The animation is really impressive as it  was just about all of it were hand drawn, and I'm glad they stuck with it as it could've been easier to do it all in computer animation. The story doesn't feel like an extended episode, and you actually don't need to watch the show in order to understand the film as it gives enough information about Batman/Bruce Wayne, and the old villain from the animated series like the Joker. The writing by Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, Martin Pasko, and Michael Reaves is great that it shown something that none of the live-action Batman films haven't done, are what Bruce Wayne's life is like before he became Batman, and actually seeing him do some detective work as none of the film's focused on his actual persona that's similar to the comics. It gives some laughs when it doesn't take it serious from the Joker, but when it gets serious, it does, and it gets suspenseful at times while also giving some fun fights. The only small problem about the film is that even though the kids are going to be shocked on the twist reveal, but for adults, it seem a little obvious on it, which I picked up on it too, even though it's not a bad twist, it's just not a shocking one. While it may not be as entertaining as The Dark Knight Trilogy or Tim Burton's Batman films, I can say that Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is the closest film that we got that shows what Batman actually is like.",

            "content": "Who ever thought an animated superhero movie was a good idea? Probably not that many people in the'90s, as they were already used to all the live action comic book adaptations they had been receiving for years. Additionally, the film's marketing campaign did not consist of all that much advertising at all, causing it to fly under the radar and perform underwhelmingly at the box office.\n\nBut more and more people are discovering this movie every passing year, and they're finding that, well, it's a really good Batman film. It has its flaws, for sure, but I can guarantee that the majority of Batman fans and non-fans alike will be able to find something in Mask of the Phantasm.\n\nOne minor negative I had with this film is a certain lack of emotional stakes. Personally, I simply often find it hard to take action seriously in cartoon movies, as it is seldom done very well. For me, Phantasm at times worked in this aspect, and other times didn't deliver the thrills I wanted it to.\n\nHowever, that's just my opinion. And generally speaking, it doesn't bother me that much, because the story and the characters are so perfectly crafted in this film that you can't help but feel the same feeling that 1989's Batman and 2008's The Dark Knight left you with.\n\nAnd is it as good as The Dark Knight? No, because that movie is pretty much the perfect superhero movie. But is it as terrible as Batman & Robin? Of course not. However, I do think it's the best animated Batman movie, and I'd also say it's even better than both Batman Returns and Batman Forever. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a clever, innovative animated film that I had a lot of fun with. Though it can't really match the intensity of some slightly superior Batman movies, Phantasm is sure to entertain audiences everywhere, and marks a solid entry in the DC Comics canon.\n\nRATING: B+",

Higher production values were put to good use as the movie's animation is sharp, while featuring more detailing in its art design as well as a more vivid color palette, without of course taking away from the noire aesthetic.\n\nThe plot surrounds the mystery behind the Phantasm, rooted by a look at the origins of Batman, and by extension Bruce Wayne's early adulthood. It also makes for a tragic love story, thus establishing Bruce's unwillingness to commit to a relationship. And, unlike the Animated series, it isn't afraid to portray more violent imagery, along with the death of human characters, one in particular getting an absolutely shocking reveal.\n\nSpeaking of which, the operatic music that couples the soundtrack also adds to the horror surrounding Phantasm and the film's noire aesthetic altogether. It is nothing short of stellar. The voice acting also holds up.\n\nMy only complaint is that it ends on a cliffhanger that is solved off-screen, while its drama comes off as a bit schmaltzy, although all this could be due to the running time falling short; a necessary trade-off for focusing on the film's overall quality.\n\nThat said, Mask of the Phantasm is a must-see Batman movie. Along with what was said prior, the suspense and action are bumped up a notch for constant thrills, even during its bits of origin exposition. And while I'm not familiar with the source material, and besides loving the Tim Burton live-action Batman films, Mask of the Phantasm probably is as close to the source material as it gets.",

It is only his unusual sense of ethics that keeps him from becoming a full-blown psychotic. The story describes the origins of Batman as it follows the Dark Knight's attempts to capture the elusive, deadly Phantasm who kills a crime lord and makes it look as if Batman did it, causing a media smear campaign against the Caped Crusader. At the same time, millionaire Bruce Wayne holds a party at his mansion. There he meets Councilman Arthur Reeves, the man behind the accusations. Reeves derides playboy Wayne for allowing his college sweetheart Andrea Beaumont to leave him. Suddenly Wayne flashes back to his pre-Batman days. He remembers how he met her while visiting his parents' graves to renew his vow that he would spend his life fighting crime to avenge their wrongful deaths.

Mask of the Phantasm is an in depth psychological analysis of our hero when a figures of his past return to haunt him in a way he never could have expected. Timm and Radomski continue the groundbreaking TV series in this film. The apperance of a vigilante known as the Angel of Death murdering mob figures in Gotham, the blame is put on The Dark Knight as he investigates it begins to lead to his past and a stunning revelation of emotion, and doubt. \n\nThis is not only the definitive animated movie of the Batman, but also one of the character's defining moments in general. This film delves straight into the mythos of the character as well as the Animated Series itself to bring forth a film that is very dark, very personal. The pacing is great and very mysterious,the animation of the series is retained and does it ever look amazing in a film with a bigger budget. The film as well gives Bruce Wayne a love interest that has more to do with the story than that would seem as well as tying the Phantasm in with Batman's greatest foe, the Joker. \n\nThe music fits perfectly with the film and the action scenes are very well done. Batman in the animated series has always been the most true to the comics in terms of his dialogue, actions and intellect. Kevin Conroy is the definitive voice of the character he is purely a genius he gives the character an edge a drive and an emotion like no other voice actor can for the character. His voice has become identified with the role. The exact same can be said about Mark Hamill and voicing the Joker, his Joker's manical laugh is iconic and deadly. The Joker of the animated series has always been dark, gruesome and a psychopath and most of these props go to Hamill's intense voicing of the character.  Both have voiced their respective characters in the DCAU, as well as various DC animated film adaptions and most recently the excellent and jaw dropping Batman: Arkham video games.\n\nMask of the Phantasm from start to its climatic ending and the triumphant final scene is true to the character and as one critic pointed out, he is Gotham's savior truly the way he was meant to be.",

Batman's love interest Andrea Beumont is easily one of the strongest character in the movie, and it was great see what motivated Bruce Wayne to become Batman.
