            "content": "Cat and mouse thriller for an archetypal thriller!\n\nDirector Andrew Davis' action thriller The Fugitive (1993) holds up with tense encounters and suspense chases around Chicago. Davis keeps you engaged with intense direction that has sweeping wide shots of Chicago's cityscape from cinematographer Michael Chapman. I love the close-ups like in the iconic sewer scene, where Tommy Lee Jones shouts, \"I don't care!\" Andrew Davis delivers a truly timeless thriller with chases, distractions, and twists galore.\n\nWriters Jeb Stuart and David Twohy adapted Roy Huggins' novel for an intricate crime narrative about a murdered wife, a one armed assailant, an obsessed marshal, and a desperate innocent man on the run. The Fugitive lets us sympathize with Kimble because he's innocent and he's a doctor who is always trying to help others. It's a great story told in an elegant and effective way. The Fugitive is exciting, emotional, and intense fun.\n\nHarrison Ford is likable as the fugitive in question Dr. Richard Kimble. His clear love for his wife, care for patients, and patience in tracking down the real killer while evading police is gripping. Ford finds an emotional heart to Kimble. Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding and hilarious as the gruff and persistent Deputy U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard. His fastidious nature makes him a pitbull of a man and pursuer. Jones is so entertaining and my favorite as of The Fugitive. It's easy to see why he won Best Supporting Actor despite being up against legendary performances from Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List or Pete Postlethwaite within In the Name of the Father.\n\nSela Ward is sympathetic and pretty as Helen Kimble. Joe Pantoliano is a riot as the smart-mouthed Deputy U.S. Marshal Cosmo Renfro. Andreas Katsulas is creepy as the one armed man Fredrick Sykes. Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 is sleazy and friendly alike as Dr. Charles Nichols. Daniel Roebuck as Deputy U.S. Marshal Bobby Biggs, Tom Wood as Deputy U.S. Marshal Noah Newman, L. Scott Caldwell as Deputy U.S. Marshal Erin Poole, and Johnny Lee Davenport as Deputy U.S. Marshal Henry are all a scream opposite Tommy Lee Jones' fiery orders and steadfast command.\n\nJulianne Moore is gorgeous and playful as the smart and observant Dr. Anne Eastman in an early career role for her. Jane Lynch is considerate as the helpful Dr. Kathy Wahlund. Dick Cusack makes a nice appearance as Kimble's Attorney Walter Gutherie. Nick Searcy is great as the underhanded Sheriff Rawlins. Neil Flynn has a memorable cameo as the unfortunate Transit Cop.\n\nEditors Dennis Virkler, Dov Hoenig, David Finfer, Richard Nord, Don Brochu, and Dean Goodhill worked together to splice together all the Chicago footage to ensure intense chases felt exhilarating. They really cover all their bases with flashbacks and bits of information getting a quick cut to jog the viewer's memory, so that we can always follow along. Production designer J. Dennis Washington creates hospitals, law offices, and homes stuffed with realistic props from set decorator Rick Gentz.\n\nComposer James Newton Howard wrote a thrilling and powerful film score for The Fugitive. The main theme is so exciting with intense string arrangements. Costume designers Aggie Guerard Rodgers and Linda Henrikson create tons of marshal's outfits and runaway disguises. Makeup artists Peter Robb-King, Rodger Jacobs, and Pat Gerhardt create several visual changes and facial makeup choices to disguise Harrison Ford and give him injuries. Hairstyling from Kathe Swanson, Dominic Mango, and Mary Buono give Ford dye jobs and different cuts for unique hair disguises throughout The Fugitive.\n\nIn all, The Fugitive is worth seeing and rewatching time and time again.",

He has always been an average performer in my opinion, but his acting chops are on full display in this film, especially in the opening sequence. Tommy Lee Jones is also great in this movie, with his performance more genuine than later movies (when he is a curmudgeon).\n\nFrom start to finish, I was glued to the action and fully invested in what happened to Dr. Kimble.

            "content": "Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones race around in circles for this memorable early '90s cat-and-mouse blockbuster, skillfully adapting and modernizing a four-season television series from thirty years prior. The Fugitive doesn't fool around, racing through dozens of heavy plot points in the first hour without feeling overwhelming or hyperactive. It's a succinct, condensed version of a once-sprawling serial, one which trims away the obligatory TV padding without skipping any good bits.\n\nWhile it's trucking through those establishing shots, the story is a whiplash stunner; in the blink of an eye, we see our protagonist as a respected physician, grieving husband, bewildered murder suspect, sentenced convict, opportunistic escapee and outdoor survivalist, with one particularly well-executed train derailment thrown in to really kick off all the turmoil. Almost by necessity, the second act slows down to focus on the chase, balancing Ford's attempts to lay low with Jones's top-of-the-food-chain detective work. That performs well, too, a firm gear-shift from the opening salvo's manic mayhem (one that's certainly assisted by its two phenomenal cornerstone stars), though it does lose its way as all the different points converge and the moment of resolution draws near. By contrast, the ending falls more on the bland, derivative side; careful suspense cast aside in favor of a big chair-tossing, pipe-swinging, rock'em'sock'em finale. These scenes are inoffensive, but a decided step down from what we'd seen and felt just prior. Put it this way: I still vividly recalled the bus crash and dam jump, decades after I last saw them. I'd forgotten all about the climactic rooftop fist fight.\n\nWhile the gettin's good, it's real good. A fairly simple premise with plenty of intrigue and gray morality, a tight script, more than one all-decade action set, a super-sized portion of Tommy Lee Jones intensity and lots and lots of chances for grim Harrison Ford to glance worriedly over his shoulder. Maybe not perfect, but it still holds up.",

Harrison Ford is at his frantic best, in one of his best and most memorable roles, as Dr Richard Kimble who is on the run and trying to clear his name. Tommy Lee Jones shines, and quite frankly steals the show, as the determined and duty bound US Marshall. Honestly, this film has always been known as a Harrison Ford vehicle, but it can be argued its a Tommy Lee Jones film. Ford is out to find the truth and stay one step ahead of the US Marshall. He has a simple arc, and little to no character development. Hes still that same guy as he started the film. But it is Tommy Lee Jones who has the best arc. He is trying to catch Ford with no regard for the truth, just the duty of bringing him in. But over the course of the film, gradually works out that this isn't a straight forward job and comes to realise there is something more to this task. I believe, he let Kimble slip through his fingers as much, because he knew he would lead him to the solution of this mystery. He has the best character arc and the best development.\nThe only thing that goes against this film, is that I waited too long to watch it. It has been parodied and mimicked within an inch of it life. I felt like I had already seen it, from various parodies in The Simpsons and even the Leslie Nielsen film, Wrongfully Accused. For me, this film wasn't as exciting and refreshing to watch, as those who watched it when it came out.  And, to me, thats a shame, that so many film are no longer as enjoyable as they should be, because so many of the best bits have been lifted and shown elsewhere.",

I can't tell you how good Jones and Ford are in this movie, it must be experienced for yourself, they actually don't have too many scenes together, but they carry the entire movie very well when you keep switching back and forth between them. The script tries to keep up with the great performances, not to say that it was bad, it was actually complex and thought-provoking, and there is nothing super unrealistic happening either, this film is very grounded in reality and everyone feels very human and vulnerable. There is also a lot of great intensity and suspense in this film when Ford is on the run, you always get worried, scared even, if he will get caught or escape in spectacular fashion, he's never really safe, he always has to be aware of his surroundings and try and blend in as much as possible, and there is a sense of urgency as well, all of that together makes this a great display of emotions and senses without using any dialogue, this uses the show don't tell method to perfection. The bus crash scene has got to be my favorite, you fear for his life so much, and you actually care about what happens to him, every character developing moment at the very beginning of the film pays off greatly. I also enjoy the mystery aspect of this film, Ford is not only on the run, but he is investigating his wife's murder as well and it adds depth to what he is doing, the script is very well fleshed out from a character development and plot perspective, I was genuinely surprised by how good is and realized it even when I was younger. I can't really think of a more entertaining and engaging thriller than this film, it is a classic in my eyes and I love how rewatchable it is, even when you know what happens, that is thanks to the genuine intensity and pure fear that this film evokes within you. This is a very well written and even better-acted film and is very deserving of high praise.",

This is my favourite film of all time for so many reasons. Firstly, Harrison Ford is my favourite actor and he gives his best performance in this film as Dr Richard Kimble; Secondly, all of the supporting actors and actresses are truly phenomenal as they give powerful performances but Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as U.S Marshal Sam Gerard which he won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and he absolutely deserved those awards; Thirdly, all of the chase scenes and action sequences in this film never lose suspense and intensity which can be a difficult job but it was perfectly executed and lastly, the score in this film is so beautiful and spine-chilling making the atmosphere and every scene so unique and amazing. Andrew Davis is the brains behind this masterpiece which is based of the 1960s TV series 'The Fugitive', he is also the brains behind 'Under Siege' which is one of my favourite films of all time and 9 cast members from 'Under Siege' are in this film including Tommy Lee Jones. I've watched this film so many times now and it never gets boring and I actually enjoy it more every time I watch it which says a lot. Overall, this is an exhilarating film that I highly recommend to people who like Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, crime films and perfectly made films. What are you waiting for???????? Watch this film if you haven't already!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "The fact that this film was nominated for Best Picture displays just how male oriented the membership of the Academy must be as they selected a thriller featuring middle aged men over better popular, mainstream films such as Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and The Age of Innocence (1993). Obviously the film wasn't made for me as I am not an aging father with fears about my own mortality but for the genre it works in this is a decent film by my estimation. While I have never understood the appeal of Harrison Ford as a leading man he is perfectly serviceable here and Tommy Lee Jones gives an Academy Award winning performance as the man on his tail. This isn't one of the best films of 1993, an unusually deep year of cinema, but there are definitely worse choices that could have been made.\n\nRespected vascular surgeon Richard Kimble, Harrison Ford, finds his wife brutally murdered by a mysterious one armed man one night after returning from a convention. He is found guilty of murdering his wife when it is discovered that he is the sole beneficiary of her life insurance policy and is sentenced to death. He escapes from the bus transporting him to death row after other passengers are able to shoot most of the guards on board and an accident occurs. U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard, Tommy Lee Jones, is assigned to track down Kimble and as Kimble attempts to adopt new identities and hide out in the houses of random people he investigates his wife's murder. Kimble makes several miraculous escapes from his captor and armed with information about men with prosthetic arms he comes closer to absolving himself of his crimes.\n\nThere are several thrilling action set pieces in the film that fans of the genre will surely be familiar with as the fast moving train that Ford is barely able to escape, the elevator precariously suspended between floors and the dive into a dramatic dam of our protagonist do make for some tense, exciting moments. These are spaced out between scenes of Ford desperately hiding under a quilt of leaves while hiding out from Jones and correctly diagnosing a young patient in a Chicago hospital. Director Andrew Davis has a knack for keeping the action coming even as the plot is quite obviously ludicrous and the characters aren't as complex and fascinating as they could be. This all adds up to creating an enjoyable yarn which will keep audiences of all types engaged but I still felt that there was something lacking.\n\nI needed to feel Kimble's desperation more than I did as while Ford's shaken expressions and the cheesy flashbacks featuring Sela Ward setting up a romantic homecoming for Ford give us the gist of who Kimble is I wanted more depth. I am not asking for a thirty minute section of the film that is just about Ford loving his wife but perhaps just one scene in which we more firmly establish how important she is to him before she is beaten to death. The court case is then relatively unbelievable as he appears to have no defense and is sentenced almost immediately to death row. Because this is a thriller this is a plot point that you just go along with but considering the amount of prestige attached to the film I expected more. The film also does not lean into the camp that makes a thriller so delightfully an compelling and instead chooses to portray everything with a straight face leaving no room for some of the more offbeat plot points to be interpreted as humorous or deliberately wacky. \n\nFord is solid but rather dull as a lead with his Kimble coming across as the same boring, grumpy man he plays in most films and another leading man from this era could have spiced up the film a little bit. Jones is quite impressive as a man with total dedication to his job who begins to stray from his own strict beliefs as he too questions whether his target is innocent or guilty. No, he's not better than Leonardo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? (1993) or Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List (1993) but he's good enough to receive special recognition for his work. \n\nOverall a decent but underwhelming thriller that was overrated during it's time and appears heavily flawed when viewed through a modern perspective.",

I had a ton of fun watching this movie and will gladly see it again some day in the future. Everything in this movie from the direction, cinematography, script and the excellent score by James Newton Howard screams 90's and reminds me of an era where things were just more simple.\n\nAndrew Davis did a really good job directing this movie, as every scene is filled with tension, but also functions as a build-up for the next sequence. Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are both fantastic in this movie, definitely one of their best performances for both of them, simply outstanding job. John Pantoliano is also excellent here, I think he's one of the most underrated actors out there, not a lot of people talk about him. He was amazing in The Sopranos, The Matrix and also here.\n\nLike I said, this movie just screams 90's, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I think it works both as a positive and a negative for the movie. This is a film that, while watching it, you are instantly reminded of a certain age in cinema and how movies were produced during that time, which is very interesting. However, that also tells me that the film hasn't aged as well as I would have liked. A few lines here and there seem a bit too cheesy and I found the ending to be very predictable, because I think most of the movies produced during this time and considering the tone of the film early on, I knew Harrison Ford was gonna be innocent. It's also kind of obvious that his other doctor friend was somehow involved in the whole crime. And the ending with the reporters asking stuff about the conclusion of the movie, letting us know that the world now knows that Harrison Ford is considered innocent in the public eye.\n\nThere were some things that I don't think made a lot of sense. First off, if they wanted to kill Harrison Ford, why did they send a one-armed man? Couldn't they find someone better for the job? I mean the guy was clearly a psycho, since he ended up killing his wife instead of Harrison Ford. And then, how did Harrison Ford get so much money to survive for so long? I believe they mention at some point that it had been a year since he escaped and unless I missed something, the only money he gets is the money he borrows from his evil friend, which I take it it wasn't a lot, since it was only what he had on him at the time. Also, the final fight between the two is just shlock. \n\nBut, even with all its apparent flaws, The Fugitive is a very entertaining movie and I really liked it.\n",

It is not only fun and entertaining, but intriguing and interesting as well. I don't often site performances as part of the reason for a movie being great, but here it most certainly is. It stars my two favorite actors - Harrison Ford, playing the innocent man on the run after being accused of murdering his wife, and Tommy Lee Jones, the clever, cunning U.S. Marshall on his tail. All the while, Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) pursues his own investigation into who really killed his wife, the infamous one-armed man. There are so many great, thrilling sequences in this movie, and it is one of the few thrillers to fully deliver on its exciting presence.

Jones is a great supporting actor, inhabiting a character both ruthless and charismatic, and Ford keeps us on his side as the man caught on the wrong side of the law. The bursts of action and chase scenes are fun to watch, but it's nothing overly special, and our grieving hero doesn't seem to care much for the loss of his wife, almost dismissing it completely, which seems pretty callous and unrealistic. He never manages to stay far ahead of Jones, which keeps things taut and our hero constantly on his toes. It's not something I'd rush to see again, but it's a fun, straightforward chase movie that's worth seeing for the 2 lead performances and it's brief bursts of energy.",

But Gerard does not care about the case, does not care why Kimble is running he just knows he has a job to do and he is going to do everything in his power to do it.  There have been a lot of movies about fugitives on the loose running from the cops, but The Fugitive tops them all.  Both actors in the prime of their careers give outstanding performances.  Jones is flawless as the arrogant U.S. Marshal tracking Kimble's every move.  This movie is beyond thrilling and exciting and will keep you tense and on the edge of your seat the entire time.",

The supporting cast is superb, featuring veteran character actors like Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 and Joe Pantoliano, and some rising stars, particularly Julianne Moore is an early prominent role.  Andrew Davis, a reliable action director who helmed career peak films for both Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal, does the best work of his career here, especially on a series of action set pieces that are some of the best of the decade.",

Harrison Ford, of course, gives an outstanding performance as the fugitive Dr. Richard Kimble.  His character is such a likable guy, and Ford's performance really sells it.  And as great as Ford is, I equally enjoyed the performance of Tommy Lee Jones as Deputy Samuel Gerard.  I especially love Jones's charisma and charm.  It provides nice comedic relief to counterbalance Ford's tragic character.\n\nIt's movies like this that remind me why I love Harrison Ford.

On his way to jail, a fortuitous accident allows him to escape from the police, and begin an investigation into his wife's murder. While also trying to keep one step ahead of a committed team of US Marshals led by Samuel Gerard, played to Oscar-winning perfection by Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nThe Fugitive arrived in theaters as part of a new trend in Hollywood to create movies based on popular television shows. And why not? A great story premise no matter where it comes from, is probably going to work on the big screen if given to the right people.\n\nSet during a brisk Chicago winter, the 'Windy City' makes for a great backdrop to this tightly written thriller. Each and every second of this production is either developing great characters, or moving the plot forward. Andrew Davis's direction is unfussy and mostly, just the facts ma'am, but he also allows for the occasional theatrics which stops The Fugitive from ever feeling slow or boring. Making great use of James Newton Howard's excellent score to build character, or to add an extra punch to the action.\n\nThe best thing about The Fugitive however, is Harrison Ford. Absolutely convincing as the intelligent and resourceful Dr. Kimble, yet also brings a great vulnerability to the part, as his character mourns the loss of his wife, and runs from the police. Dr Kimble is a man you want to root for. Ford's earnest performance of a wrongly convicted man trying to clear his name, should have even the most cynical moviegoers sweating his troubles, and celebrating his victories!\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThere's not much else I can add that would prepare you for this film. It's a very solidly made well written thriller, and has two memorable performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is film looks great, and would be well serviced on a theater screen or large TV at home.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nIf you ever foolishly doubt the acting talents of Harrison Ford, and think he's only good for bit of swashbuckling fun as Indiana Jones or Han Solo, then watch the scene in this movie where he's being questioned by the police. Watch him slowly get more and more upset as their questions start to insinuate his guilt in the murder of his character's wife, and then tell me he can't act.\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/the-fugitive-1993/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Jones is brilliant in his Oscar winning turn as Marshal Sam Jarrad, playing him not as a bad guy but just a dedicated law officer trying to catch his man, whether he's guilty or innocent.  Behind the camera, Twohy & Stuart's script is smart & focused on the main story, with nice nods to the TV show (from Kimbell helping others despite the risk of getting caught to Jarrad's growing doubts about his guilt) while Davis keeps the action move with some brilliant set-pieces (the train crash is even more impressive today giving it was done with practical effects).

Not only is it essentially one big chase, its also one huge condensed TV series that had 120 episodes into a 2 hour film, not only that but it flowed perfectly and was expertly made, it's quite amazing. \n\nWhilst watching it, I was really sucked into the story that was going on, its interesting to see how someone could evade the law enforcement for so long and none of it felt silly or unbelievable. However, there were a few select cases where I did think that if this were real that it would play out a little differently, but this is a film... I just sat back and enjoyed what was going on. \n\nThe effects were quite impressive, it looks like very little of it was created on a computer and helps add to the intensity of what was going on. The music was good also, had a very unique essence to it and fits with the film well. A film using its budget wisely, I like it. \n\nTommy Lee Jones was so strange here, at first it seemed like he was in the wrong film. He was so strangely eccentric, it really stood out, he brought his own kind of humor to it. You can hardly accuse TLJ of ever giving a bad performance, much like Harrison Ford, but he certainly was strange, he is one of the things that this is remembered for and it is what got him his Oscar too, dare I say it? He might overshadow Ford at some points. Also Julianne Moore was here too and took me by surprise at first, I know this is one of her early roles but I was thinking whilst watching this, hey wouldn't it be cool if a really big named actor just showed up randomly for a moment in a film and then it happened. \n\nI can't think of any big negative, I had one very minor complaint before but that wasn't even important and is just me being weird. The film offers a very tense action packed ride that is interesting and exciting, showcases very two strong performances with some very odd humor, most of it courtesy of Mr. Tommy Lee and is just overall a very fun thrill ride that has a good story behind it all. A classic.",

This film version manages to capture the spirit of the original series, and it manages to be a great thriller getting the balance just right. Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) comes home to find his wife Helen (Sela Ward) being beaten by a one-armed man, and due to a misunderstood phone call, Kimble is sentenced to death. On the way to death row, other prisoners on the bus stage attempt to escape. In the confusion, a train crashes into the bus, but not before Kimble is able to escape. But it's not long before Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is hot on his tail. But, Kimble uses his escape to try and find who framed him for the murder, with help from his old friend Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabb\u00e9), Kimble goes undercover to find who the one-armed man was. It is a very suspenseful film, and it was one of the few examples of a film version of a classic TV show making a successful transition, it has a very good cast, Jones won an Oscar for his role as the sharp and unstoppable U.S. Marshal, who would return in a sequel called U.S. Marshals 5 years later.",

However, when you look at it today, you may not get the same feeling.\nThough the storyline is pretty good and the direction of the movie is quite thrilling, certain scenes of the movie come to question:\n1. Harrison Fords incredible jump of nearly 300 meter high into the waters - and still surviving it\n2. The Entire Police Force not being able to corner one simple doctor?\n3. The manner in which Harrison Ford uncovers the mystery of the murder\n4. The Improbable nature of how the movie ended.\n\nWhile you may think these are very small bits to the movie - they actually make you laugh with disbelief and hence make you disconnect from the character, the plot and the movie.\n\nSo Moment of Truth\nAn Entertaining Movie that is good enough for a single watch. It still does have its charm. Especially the Train Crash Scene - which to be honest, I still cannot for the life of me understand what was the point of having it in the movie???\n\nOverall Ratings\n6 out of 10\n\nLoy Machedo\nloymachedo dot com | whoisloymachedo dot com",

The first half of the film is good, with lots of action and edge of the seat thrills. Then the second half comes in and tries to explain how he was convicted.

It has plenty of action and thrills that are iconic of a Harrison Ford film from the early 90's era.\nThe Fugitive is packed with great action and an excellent level of thrills, and a great constant feel of intensity throughout the many plot dynamics which are really epic.\nAnd Harrison Ford plays a great lead role, giving his character realistic emotional sense to motives and intensity to his actions and providing a strong character for the film to follow, rather than just another action hero.\nTommy Lee Jones gives one of his greatest performances in the supporting role of a relentless US Marshal and makes him a strong hero with villainous tendencies, which really contributes complexity to his character. Tommy Lee Jones provides a great feel of futility to the atmosphere of The Fugitive and so it makes the story all the more compelling.\n\nI can't say I've ever seen the original TV Show The Fugitive, but I'm sure that a film this good is an honour to it on so many levels. A large portion of the praise can be attributed to the directional skills of Andrew Davis who is primarily known for action films and therefore knows how to handle proper explosions and gunfire in an action sequence, and this time around even manages to add some depth and realism to such a strong story of a wrongful convict. The Fugitive is a classic action thriller that isn't overshadowed by the actions, but rather the plot dynamics.\nThe Fugitive also features great cinematography, skilled film editing and an intense musical score. So All in all, The Fugitive is an above-average action thriller film to add to Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones' lists of awesome features.",

Most of them make fun of the original TV series, and many just flop. \"The Fugitive\" is easily one of the best Big Screen remakes of a classic TV series to date, if not the best in general. \r\n\r\nVascular surgeon, \"Dr. Richard Kimball\" (Harrison Ford) is arrested, tried and wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife (Sela Ward, seen in flashbacks) and sentenced to death. \r\n\r\nSome time after being sent to prison, \"Dr. Kimball\" and other prisoners are being transported to another prison by bus. Minutes pass, and one of the prisoners appears to be having a seizure, making the bus driver stop. As the guards check on the prisoner, a train's horn can be heard coming closer. Suddenly, the bus is hit by the train, killing many, while surviving prisoners escape. One of the survivors is \"Dr. Kimball,\" who pulls a seriously injured guard from the wreck before running. \r\n\r\nThe next day, \"US Deputy Marshal Samuel 'Big Dog' Gerard\" (Tommy Lee Jones) and his team come to the scene of the wreck and discovers that \"Dr. Kimball\" had survived, and begins to go after him. \r\n\r\n\"Deputy Gerard\" expects that he is after a convicted murder, but soon learns the truth of \"Dr. Kimball's\" case by piecing together clues he finds while on the fugitive's trail about the same time \"Dr. Kimball\" himself is finding clues leading to the same conclusion -- and his innocence. \r\n\r\nThe first thing you will notice is that is lots of action and great acting from the main cast. When it comes to the action, the scenes are edited well together, and are spread apart enough so that you will get some time to breathe. \r\n\r\nThe next thing you will notice is that the movie, as a whole, is written nicely. There are a few times where the script lags, but there isn't that much lagging. The story is compelling, and you cheer \"Dr. Kimball\" and \"Deputy Gerard\" pretty much equally. \r\n\r\nThe movie is nicely edited, and shot. Scenes that stand out are action and fight scenes. You will also like the scenes where \"Deputy Gerard\" and his team are close to capturing their fugitive. The scenes are filled with suspense just as much as action. \r\n\r\nThere is a little problem with character development with the supporting cast. Most notably \"Deputy Gerard's\" team and a few villains. But these flaws are forgettable thanks to the story itself. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, \"The Fugitive\" is not only a great movie to watch on HBO or Encore, it is also a great selection for a first-choice the next time you go to your local video rental store as well as a good addition to your collection.",

            "content": "The Fugitive is most likely the most recognizable film that Schindler's List tossed aside while cruising to its Best Picture win, as well as being the recipient of the Oscar that probably should have gone to Ralph Fiennes's mesmerizing Amon Goeth of the same movie (even though Tommy Lee Jones was fantastic in this). Going with that, this movie must be very good. And good it is, perhaps even great, but it is not the king of thrillers of the last 20 years that people may say.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with the Fugitive is simply that I feel it is slightly long. Its premise and plot is intriguing, but not in depth enough to handle a run time of this caliber. Take off twenty minutes or so, and you've got a fast, breathless thriller that runs smoothly. Instead, the 130 minutes it stands up to makes you feel a little worn out by the end, and not in the good way that it should. \r\n\r\nOther than that, this is an entertaining chase flick. Harrison Ford does his usual action hero thing and Jones is, as I said, fantastic. Besides those two leading the acting charge, there's really nobody else to stand out. Julianne Moore does less than her character does in the movie, and Jorean Krabbe, once a mediocre Bond villain, makes for a mediocre role here as well. However, Ford's and Jones's presence are more than enough to make up for any shortcomings from their screen companions. In addition, the action scenes are well shot and succeed in giving the film some momentum when things get dull during the length. \r\n\r\nWhile not one of the most incredible thrillers out there, and perhaps not worthy of a Best Picture nomination, The Fugitive does its job to entertain you, even if the length may not keep things movie quite as fast as it should. \r\n\r\n\"I didn't kill my wife!\"\r\n\"I don't care!\"",
