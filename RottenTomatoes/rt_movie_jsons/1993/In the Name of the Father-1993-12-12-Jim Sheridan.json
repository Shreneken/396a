    "summary": "Unemployed young Irishman Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) gets by as a petty thief in 1970s Belfast. When local IRA leaders get fed up with him, he flees to England and meets up with his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch). On the same night that the IRA bombs a nearby pub, the friends get kicked out of their communal digs and are forced to sleep in a park. He returns to Belfast, but is arrested as the prime suspect in the bombing and imprisoned, where he spends 15 years trying to clear his name.",

            "content": "In the Name of the Father is a tough look at persecution and suffering, but I feel like that's a bit undercut by the fact that a large part of this film was shot in Kilmainham Gaol. It's tough to think about corrupted justice when the movie takes place in the same jail as Paddington 2. \n\nOne of the classic dramas about a fight to right a political wrong, In the Name of the Father doesn't necessarily ask you to explore difficult characters or complex situations, but it creates a compelling story regardless. Capturing all the forgotten confusion of the Troubles with really solid production value and injecting it with a flawed protagonist, the script isn't just a fight for freedom as it is a forced coming-to-terms between a slightly alienated father and son. The story might have gotten some additional mileage out of focusing more on Emma Thompson's crusading lawyer, but the lack of a payoff (no charges were ever brought against the offending officers) was probably a damper on that front, plus when you've got Day-Lewis directors tend to try to keep him front and center - half the Guildford Four are completely forgotten about. Perhaps told with slight exaggeration, the film uses its Hollywood beam for the right reasons, in order to (very successfully) place the audience front and center, giving you the same sense of betrayal that any innocent person would feel when their government decides they are the people at fault. \n\nAuthenticity aside, Day-Lewis gives an exceptional performance as an evolving character and the atmosphere that director Jim Sheridan crafts is dangerously and bitter. What the film might not have in complexity, it makes up for in poignancy. (4/5)",

            "content": "What makes In the Name of the Father a good film are basically the acting performances, with the brilliant Daniel Day-Lewis in the role as Gerry Conlon, once more showing his incredible versitilaty as a character actor, creating yet a unique expression with simple means. Also Pete Postlethwaite as his father Guiseppe does an outstanding performance, and the highly realistic locations are definitely adding to the good result. The film is being described as a 'crime drama', but 'political drama', or consequently slash 'prison drama', has to be a better categorization. Nevertheless, the political issues around the IRA and their counterpart, the British government, as principal topics, are not given enough space. The selection of time spent on the different main stages of the plot and its fundamental issues isn't all that easy to accept as being spot on. In the first third we get to know the main characters and their relations very well, and the same goes for the depiction of the environment and conditions in the prison. A result is that the pivotal and final phase about solicitor Gareth Peirce's investigation and the fight against the British legal establishment, as well as the ultimate trail, is given far to little space, and her character otherwies solidly performed by Emma Thompson, is barely established. It must most likely have been a difficult question of prioritization in the basic editing, but some of the scenes in the first two stages could easily have been compressed or rejected. The film could even be made 20 minutes longer, as it regardlessly passed the two hour limit. Questionable priorities with vague intentions and motivations, together with not killing a few rather obvious darlings, or even giving a length expansion a go, probably and sadly has ruined the chance to create a wider insight into the political game that this story and its victims truly has deserved. The difference is that ultimately it could have been an icon of a political drama.",

While it is categorized as a \"courtroom drama,\" the couple of courtroom scenes are absurd in the Kafkaesque kind of way, which I did learn while writing this piece, were some of the more embellished scenes of the movie. Really, In the Name of the Father should be considered a \"legal system drama\" or \"prison system drama\" because that is the shit that made this film horrifying \u2014 that and DDL's (unsurprisingly) stellar performance. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a young Irishman from Belfast in search of the late-60's \"free love\" in 1974 London. A bomb explodes inside of a pub in the southern English town of Guildford. I.R.A. violence is peaking in the mid-70s, and Conlon and friend, Paul Hill (John Lynch), the new Irish arrivals, are rounded up under the \"Prevention of Terrorism Act\" and forced to confess to the bombing under sickening conditions of physical and mental abuse. While Conlon and Hill don't do themselves any favors in the courtroom \u2014 their snickering and laughing reminded me of the \"West Memphis Three,\" who thought it unimaginable that they could possibly be convicted of their crimes, given their trust in the legal system and to God \u2014 the courtroom scenes are ridiculous. Basically, everyone who has known Conlon, including his father, Patrick \"Giuseppe\" Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), are rounded up, tried, convicted, and serve time in prison for conspiracy and other charges under the \"Act\". The 15-year epic of Conlon and his father in prison makes up the bulk of the film, with their eventual acquittal due to a diligent lawyer, Gareth (Emma Thompson), creating a satisfying conclusion \u2014 always warms my heart when a lawyer is a \"good guy\". Maybe not knowing the true story made this a more enjoyable film, but it also made it all the more terrifying. In the Name of the Father is a superb film concerning a timeless topic: injustice.",

However, I can't recall that I have seen a troubled father-son relationship (brought to life by astonishing performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite) has been better depicted than in this. Just look at how the experience of imprisonment somehow matured Gerry up, whether by getting to know his father more and better (the dialogue between Gerry and Giuseppe is just phenomenal), or merely due to the incidents and mishaps that he had in prison. Not to mention the painful and provocative meticulous dramatization of a miscarriage of injustice, vividly portrayed by some of the most sensible, artistic, emotionally-charged scenery that Jim Sheridan's nuanced direction are responsible of.\n\nHappy Birthday to the greatest actor ever, Daniel Day-Lewis. I do miss him!\n\n(8/10)",

            "content": "A strange thing happened to me when watching In the Name of the Father. I knew nothing about the true story of the Guildford Four before I sat down to watch this movie, in fact I didn\u2019t even know it was based on a true story. For some reason I anticipated an unexpected twist that would be revealed later in the film. Because the entire flashback sequence was told from the perspective of Gerry Conlon, I thought they were going to reveal it was an unreliable narrator situation and he was actually lying, and was guilty of the bombing. Thankfully, the film plays no tricks and is upfront and forthright about the fact that the police and the legal system are the villains. It became glaringly obvious after a while that this movie is all about someone being falsely accused and we are supposed to see the injustice in his treatment. Because I\u2019m such a big fan of legal dramas, I was hoping that In the Name of the Father would center more on Emma Thompson and her struggle to prove innocence once the backstory was completed. Instead the film was more interested in Daniel Day-Lewis and his struggle to grow up and fight back against all the people that wronged him. That was somewhat disappointing to me, particularly when the big break in the case comes basically by accident in a matter of seconds rather than through any hard work from Thompson\u2019s character. It\u2019s another one of those faulty expectation problems that left me wanting something that the film was never intended to provide. I probably would have known better what to expect if I realized the entire movie is based on an autobiographical book written by Gerry Conlon, so it\u2019s meant to tell his story. The film was also about Gerry Conlon\u2019s relationship with his father (played by Pete Postlethwaite.) It was interesting to see the dichotomy between father and son, and I think it was Potlethwaite\u2019s character who is the more endearing. It took me a great deal of time to like Daniel Day-Lewis in this film. Of course I was on his side, as he was the underdog against a corrupt system, but his personality was so abrasive. This works to show his growth, but it felt like so long before he started to grow at all. All that said, I found the story engaging and fascinating, particularly when I started to realize it was based on something that happened in real life. It\u2019s not exactly a heartwarming conclusion, and leaves you with a general sense of frustration, but that\u2019s kind of the point. In the Name of the Father is meant to outrage us on Gerry\u2019s behalf, and it succeeds at that.",

            "content": "Having not been terribly impressed by Jim Sheridan's Best Picture nominated biopic My Left Foot (1989) I was not eagerly anticipating this film as it had the same star and seemed to take the same tone. Unfortunately I can not say that the film shocked me by being daring and not conforming to the same tropes that we have seen used in courtroom dramas for decades and the milquetoast feel of the film did not help to differentiate it from it's superior predecessors. It is easy to see why the Academy, prone to making safe, unimaginative choices, were attracted to this film and lavished it with so many nominations without actually awarding it anything.\n\nIn 1974 in Belfast Young thief Gerry Conlon, Daniel Day-Lewis, lives with his loving father Giuseppe, Peter Postlethwaite, whose over attentiveness annoys him but he misses him as he leaves for London. He is meant to live with his sensible aunt Annie Maguire, Britta Smith, but spends time with free love hippies and ends up robbing a prostitute and taking drugs in a park the night that the Guildford Pub Bombings occur. He is blamed for the event and coerced by interrogators into confessing to the crime after having the life of his father threatened. He and several of his family members and friends are imprisoned and Conlon is placed in a jail cell with his father who disagrees with his lifestyle and takes action to help them appeal for another court hearing. After the death of his family Conlon takes more interest in receiving help from lawyer Gareth Peirce, Emma Thompson, who discovers evidence that the police attempted to hide through complete coincidence. She mounts a solid defense for the wrongly imprisoned men and women and they are allowed to go free.\n\nBoth of Sheridan's weepie dramas about real life figures feature angelic parental figures and while in his 1989 film you had the self sacrificing mother he opts for a caring but occasionally disappointed father. From the moment we meet him we know that he will be the titular father and can anticipate something tragic happening to him that is meant to make the audience cry and serve as motivation for the main character. Postlethwaite was a famed character actor but the role he works with here is so saccharine and sweet that it is hard for him to do anything other than appearing loving and stare at his son with pride. The real Giuseppe, or Guiseppe as it is misspelt in the film's epilogue, may well have been this way but on screen he makes for a dull character and it would have helped if he had more flaws. When he feels too good to be true it is hard to believe in his relationship with his son, the emotional center of the film, and so there is a disconnect and we are forced to engage with the film as a facts based narrative which is considerably less compelling.\n\nThe film's structure is also odd as we see a lot of Conlon in London as a crunchy hippie before he is wrongly accused of committing a crime and get very little of Peirce fighting for justice towards the end. The final scenes are some of the most rousing and while I didn't mind seeing our protagonist take drugs with a young Saffron Burrows that section of the film could have been considerably short. For a film that was over two hours long it felt insubstantial at it's end and most of the substance of the film came from a section of the film that didn't quite work for me. When Conlon and his father are trapped in prison together it should provide room for reflection and an opportunity to show the dehumanizing effect that being inside a prison can have. Another pacing issue appears at this point because we have no idea until the last few minutes of the film how many years the men have spent in prison. In addition both appear to be having a fine time in prison as Conlon is able to take LSD and his father has a friendly rapport with the prison guards. We needed to feel their pain so that their victory could be sweet and well earned but instead we are left underwhelmed.",

Sheridan brings historical accuracy and information to his picture with the story stemming from Gerry Conlon's life experiences during The Troubles and his imprisonment. Sheridan tackles the chaotic violence of The Troubles as well as the emotionally distressing aspects. In the Name of the Father is a brilliant and scathing critique of the justice system and how deeply flawed police work can be. Torture is endured and life sentences carried out for an innocent man. These cannot be continued for there to be any justice in this world. In the Name of the Father feels so important and relevant as more cases of innocent people being exonerated happen all the time.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is a revelation as Gerry Conlon. His Irish accent is thick and impressive. He sounds naturally Irish within In the Name of the Father. His deeply passionate testimonial to a man horrendously wronged by the English courts and law is moving. Day-Lewis captures a man at his wit's end with no hope for tomorrow. His silly start in the movie changes into a more and more nuanced approach to a man marred by misfortune. In the Name of the Father is one of Daniel Day-Lewis' finest performances and perseveres as one of his most important.\n\nPete Postlethwaite is incredible as Gerry Conlon's sickly and meek father Giuseppe Conlon. His principles are stalwart and his touching rapport with Day-Lewis really make the film special. His tender hand to his son is affecting as is his devotion to his faith. He stands as the moral figure of the film, who just wanted to relate his feelings to his son. It's a beautiful sentiment that Postlethwaite invokes perfectly.\n\nEmma Thompson is endearing and serious as the Conlons' lawyer. Her dedication to the case and justice are self-evident. Thompson brings a passion to the courtroom scenes and an empathy to the anguish these men have faced. She is particularly great at speaking their pain into words.\n\nThen, Corin Redgrave is aptly cast as Dixon, the head of the investigation into Conlon's case. His corrupt nature and lack of remorse is displayed on Redgrave's serious face. You just hate his character, but he plays it so subtly.\n\nTrevor Jones came up with a riveting score of intense symphonic passages for the drama and frightening atmospheric rock elements to the violent imagery.\n\nIn all, In the Name of the Father is a significant historical drama depicting a notable miscarriage of justice. I am glad for Gerry Conlon in the end, though his life was surely changed forever.",

While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. \n\nBased on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( \nDaniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson). \n\nThe initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son. \n\nTerrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite",

I remember watching Making A Murderer and being one of the few ppl thinking it was bullshit and sure enough researched it to find out much of the incriminating evidence was left out of the documentary. This movie though for once does give me a belief that in some rare cases criminals are treated unjustly and are innocent. Even after researching their case, I still believe that this was an injustice going against my own normally held beliefs that police normally do the right thing. The fact that this movie could convince me of their innocence and wrongdoing is reason alone to see this movie. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and plays the lead character with precision. The story is gripping and edited well to showcase the main points. I was able to empathize for once about how horrible it is to be innocent And locked up, not just empathize with a victim. It made me believe that either case is equally as harrowing.

Jim Sheridan followed his successful directorial debut, My Left Foot, by teaming up once again with Daniel Day Lewis who delivers yet another superb performance. I'm ashamed to admit that I just got around to watching this film for the first time on its 20th anniversary, but it was completely worth it because I was blown away by this powerful and engaging film. I wouldn't call this a groundbreaking film because we've had plenty of movies dealing with similar themes. Films like The Hurricane or The Shawshank Redemption deal with the kind of social injustice that is presented here where an innocent man is incarcerated due to a corrupt justice system. In the Name of the Father differs a bit in that it doesn't focus so much on the hope of finding freedom, but rather on the enraging aspect of the injustice that the lead character and his family and friends go through. This is a genre that I'll always be drawn too, especially when it is based on a true story because I think these people deserve to have their voice heard after all they've gone through. I know that several artistic liberties were taken to make the film, but even so it draws attention to Gerry Conlon's autobiographical book. Sheridan's direction was solid, and I liked how he focused a lot of the attention on the father and son relationship. I don't know if this film would've worked as well as it did if it weren't for Daniel Day Lewis's brilliant performance. He is without a doubt one of the best actors of our time.\n\nGerry Conlon (Daniel Day Lewis) grew up in Belfast in the 70's when the IRA terrorist attacks were at its peak. He was never involved with the terrorist group, but he was no saint either. As a young lad he felt forced to become a small time thief due to the lack of employment. While robbing some lead sheets from a roof of a house he accidentally leads British soldiers to a home that was hiding IRA weapons. Fortunately they never discovered anything, and the IRA members send Gerry off with a warning. His father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), with whom he's had an estranged relationship, sends him to London hoping he can find a better future there and escape from all the political turmoil. On his way to London, Gerry runs into his school friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) and together they decide to go visit their friend Patrick Armstrong (Mark Sheppard) who has been living in London along with a group of free spirited hippies. Unfortunately for Gerry and his friends, they end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time and are accused of bombing a soldier's pub. Bullied by the police officers they are forced into signing a confession and are sentenced to prison along with some of Gerry's family members. In prison, Gerry and his father continue to fight to prove their innocence with the help of an attorney named Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) and the more she digs into the story the more corruption she finds in the police procedures.\n\nThe film manages to draw you in and make your blood boil due to all the injustices suffered by these characters. It is one of those movies where the tension builds up with the passing of time, but at the same time you also feel a connection growing between Gerry and his father. The film becomes more than a simple social injustice tale and turns into a character driven story focusing on the relationship between father and son. It is a shame the film has kind of been forgotten because I thought it was really well made. It never won an Academy Award, but it did receive 7 nominations including Best Picture, losing out to Schindler's List that year. Daniel Day Lewis outshines everyone in this film, although the supporting cast was very strong, especially Pete Postlethwaite who shared great chemistry with Lewis. This was an intense film that had me at the edge of my seat thanks to the way in which Sheridan tells the story and slowly draws the viewer in. The final 20 minutes of this film are perfect and Daniel Day Lewis knocks his performance out of the ball park.",

It's production design is impeccably convincing and assists the functioning of the atmosphere which ensures that the viewer truly feels that they are experiencing the courtroom scene and prison for real. The atmosphere is very intense throughout In The Name Of The Father, and every moment is a powerful one. \nThe intense atmosphere is consistently maintained by the musical score as well as by the powerful dramatisation of the story, and that makes it prove to be a powerful and effective tale which tugs at the fears and angers of the viewer, making it emotionally powerful and memorable for the viewer, which Jim Sheridan deserves immense praise for achieving.\nIt's an honest story, one which documents the corruption of the 1970's but was filmed in the 1990's, reminding us all of the counter-culture time period in an Irish context strongly due to great story direction and a powerful screenplay. In The Name Of The Father even has a clever title.\nIn The Name Of The Father just manages to consistently remain as a powerful courtroom film and prison film, and above all it's an inspiring tale of fighting back against injustice.\nAnd what keeps In The Name Of The Father consistently powerful is the fine work of the dedicated and talented cast.\nDaniel Day-Lewis, considered the greatest actor of his generation, is at some of his best in In The Name Of The Father. Although that could be argued for nearly every film he has been in, In The Name Of The Father is a special case because he doesn't portray a painter with cerebral palsy or a serial killer or the president of the United States. He portrays an Irish everyman caught up in a scandal, a scandal which his character handles with a mix of dignity and anger. His skills at portraying Gerard \"Gerry\" Conlon are, as usual, flawless, and deserving of nothing short of an Academy Award nomination.\nEmma Thompson also provides a charismatic supporting role, driving her determination and unwillingness to give up forward consistently to the benefit of the story and the characters, and her natural charm and grace as an actress ensures that she can sufficiently handle the material put forward for her. \nPete Postlethwaite also proves to give one of his finest performances as his physicality conveyed a sense of frailty which was appropriately fitting to the role that he plays in the story as the father of Gerry Conlon, and his wise line delivery and characterisation skills are never short of excellent.\nJohn Lynch also proves his talents on screen during In The Name Of The Father.\n\nIn The Name Of The Father is simply a strongly compelling piece of Irish cinema which tells a powerful story with powerful direction.",

What's more, it's about the IRA, a dark history which is fewer and fewer mentioned in the media. Framed as terrorists for setting up the explosions, but who is the real culprit after all? Sadly, the truth is often covered by emotions, patriotism and unfounded public opinion. As long as sentiments are aroused to turn against you, you are doomed. Just come to think of it: in a situation like that, what can you do if you were in the English's shoes? If revenge and violence are not stopped, will the Conlons be ever allowed a chance to file an appeal in England? The abuse we witnessed here is still repeating after 40 years, and will persist as long as there is inequality in the world, regrettably. Regarding the acting crews, Daniel Day-Lewis gives a brilliant performance as the once rebellious adolescent turning into a mature and determined heroic figure, but Pete Postlethwaite is even better, for all the aspirations he offers as a simple, honest and kindhearted father.",

Rest of the story is about Giuseppe and Gerry's fight from behind the bars, their very own ideological clashes coupled with Gerry's restlessness in the wake of proving their innocence and authority's brutality.\n\nPositives:\n\n--> Real story and extremely natural settings\n\n--> Great performances by Pete Postelthwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis. \n\n--> Great musical score by Trevor Jones\n\nNegatives:\n\n--> Ignorable draggy moments at the beginning of the film",

This is yet again a powerful engaging true story of Gerry Conlon, a man falsely accused of the 1974 Guildford pub bombings orchestrated by the IRA. Sheridan assembles a phenomenal cast here, and each brings something unique to the screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is phenomenal in his performance and he is always captivating to watch in his roles because he is a perfectionist and a true artist of his craft, and he becomes the character he portrays. This is a well constructed drama that is highly entertaining from start to finish. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers yet again with this film, and like I said, he is a dedicated actor who always gives his all in a performance. The story is terrific and is based on true events, which makes for some of the best stories to tell on film. I really enjoyed the film, and when real life stories are adapted to the screen, they make for much more compelling movies. With a great cast of talented actors, effective directing and an engrossing plot, In the Name of the Father is a stellar film that should appeal to any viewer looking for a truly memorable film to watch. This is filmmaking at its very best and is a brilliant film that really can spark an interest in the subject it displays. The Strength of the film lies in its cast and plot, both are wonderful, and will surely interest the most demanding filmgoer. In terms of a great story, In the Name of the Father is terrific and as a whole, I felt it was a flawless film.",

Acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is phenomal (as usual) and also Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson shine as supporting stars. The movie isn't just a documentary though, it works on other levels such as the relationship between father and son and the brutality of the IRA/British conflict. \nHighlights\n- The opening scene depicting a riot in Belfast between (terrified) English army with machine guns and APC's and a brick-throwing mob assembled in minutes\n- Daniel Day-Lewis' performance\n- Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson performance \n- The father-son relationship, who grow apart and then come back together, howevery they always love eachother\n- The final triumphal courtroom scene which works exactly like a katharsis should\n\nLetdowns\n- nothing really important.

            "content": "A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. \r\n\r\nBased on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( \r\nDaniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson).\r\n\r\nThe initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.\r\n\r\nTerrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite",

The film is a bleak and depressing reminder how even modern day Western Democracy can commit conscious human right atrocities when facing crisis. \n\nI rarely depend on quoting film lines, but to summarize In the Name of the Father it feels appropriate; as Gerry states after his farce trial: \"Our case was so insane that if you made it up, nobody would believe it\". Yet Gerry Conlyn (Daniel Day-Lewis) was sentenced for life in prison by British court along with most of his family(!) and other unfortunate side standers. Even more amazingly Gerry and the rest were sentenced to prison largely based on shoddy evidence and confessions extracted with torture techniques(!). Sounds unbelievable and yet  Gerry's story is true. \n\nAs mind boggling from human's right perspective as Gerry's imprisonment part is, the film does contain a more warm and positive side to it in form of father-son reunion. Gerry and his father Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite) forge a strong bond and put aside their difficult past in order to survive their unfair imprisonment. These scenes contain some of the best acting ever from Daniel Day-Lewis where he fully throws himself into the role and portrays the emotional chaos Gerry goes through during his imprisonment.  \n\nStill the film was not quite as involving as I'd hoped it to be. The acting and story definitely deserve praise, but like with director Jim Sheridan's other famous tittle, The Boxer, I could not fully immerse myself totally in the film. Perhaps it is Sheridan's brutally bleak directing and story telling which keeps me somewhat detached from the film and characters. Even so In the Name of the Father is technically excellent biography film, no question about that, and proves yet again Daniel Day-Lewis' unquestionable talent for acting.",

Even though they were only separated by eleven years in real life, Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite make a convincing father and son, and Postlethwaite seemingly comes from nowhere with this heartfelt, compassionate performance.\r\n\r\nWe've come to expect greatness from Day Lewis, and he does not disappoint here either. Watching his transformation from aimless street punk to civil rights crusader is mesmerizing. My only complaint is that it comes too late in the film. I would also have liked to see more of Emma Thompson in a supporting role as the lawyer who eventually frees him. The film spends too much time in the prison and not enough focusing on her efforts to prove his innocence. \r\n\r\nThe scene in the courthouse that closes the picture is powerful when Gerry Condon is ultimately vindicated, but it feels rushed. Many of the characters are composites of real people and some, like Don Baker's character who confesses to being the real bomber behind bars, are completely fictitious. More time should have been spent on Thompson's story than his, especially considering he was never even a part of the actual story. \r\n\r\nStill, the film is very potent and the story needed to be told, and under Jim Sheridan's masterful direction, it moves briskly and draws you in. But the performances and story are the real draws here, and in that respect, \"In the Name of the Father\" is worthy of all the praise. The dramatic licenses add little, as the real events are compelling enough without all of the embellishments.",

The things that make this movie a winner is its simple yet strong story and immeasurably powerful performances. The movie is about Gerry Conlon and his three friends, the team of whom was later christened as the \"Guildford Four\". They were falsely accused of bombing and killing. This was followed by multiple arrests, including those of Gerry's Aunt and Father, Giuseppe. \n\nFull credit to Jim Sheridan for handling the plot in an appropriate way by following a linear narrative. It is the credit of the director for showing the unique bond between Gerry and Giuseppe, which I am quite sure can be related by any father-son pair. About performances; when there is Daniel Day Lewis, as Gerry, there will be impeccable and majestic acting. I always fall short of adjectives when I talk about Day-Lewis' acting. Be that when he got the news of his father's death or in the climax or any other single scene featuring him, he excelled. Pete Poslethwaithe was also brilliant as Giuseppe and got matched Day-Lewis' acting. Emma Thompson, always a fantastic actress, didn't disappoint and was excellent especially in the last climax courtroom scene. Special mention to Don Baker as Joe McAndrew.\n\nAs a final note this is a movie which, as its fantastic soundtrack 'In the Name of the Father\" by U2 indicates, tells a story about love,humanity and fighting for truth and those make this movie no less great than The Shawshank Redemption.",

Life just isn't fair sometimes.  Anyway this movie is excellent, even if it isn't exactly the most historically accurate film.  The rebuilding of the relationship between Gerard and his father, while completely false, made for a good story and ultimately when the so called accomplices to this bombing were vindicated, it was an incredibly satisfying feeling.  Daniel Day Lewis, as should be no surprise, was tremendous in his role but since the story is a strong one he doesn't need to carry the movie entirely on his shoulders.

Jim Sheridan followed his successful directorial debut, My Left Foot, by teaming up once again with Daniel Day Lewis who delivers yet another superb performance. I'm ashamed to admit that I just got around to watching this film for the first time on its 20th anniversary, but it was completely worth it because I was blown away by this powerful and engaging film. I wouldn't call this a groundbreaking film because we've had plenty of movies dealing with similar themes. Films like The Hurricane or The Shawshank Redemption deal with the kind of social injustice that is presented here where an innocent man is incarcerated due to a corrupt justice system. In the Name of the Father differs a bit in that it doesn't focus so much on the hope of finding freedom, but rather on the enraging aspect of the injustice that the lead character and his family and friends go through. This is a genre that I'll always be drawn too, especially when it is based on a true story because I think these people deserve to have their voice heard after all they've gone through. I know that several artistic liberties were taken to make the film, but even so it draws attention to Gerry Conlon's autobiographical book. Sheridan's direction was solid, and I liked how he focused a lot of the attention on the father and son relationship. I don't know if this film would've worked as well as it did if it weren't for Daniel Day Lewis's brilliant performance. He is without a doubt one of the best actors of our time.\n\nGerry Conlon (Daniel Day Lewis) grew up in Belfast in the 70's when the IRA terrorist attacks were at its peak. He was never involved with the terrorist group, but he was no saint either. As a young lad he felt forced to become a small time thief due to the lack of employment. While robbing some lead sheets from a roof of a house he accidentally leads British soldiers to a home that was hiding IRA weapons. Fortunately they never discovered anything, and the IRA members send Gerry off with a warning. His father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), with whom he's had an estranged relationship, sends him to London hoping he can find a better future there and escape from all the political turmoil. On his way to London, Gerry runs into his school friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) and together they decide to go visit their friend Patrick Armstrong (Mark Sheppard) who has been living in London along with a group of free spirited hippies. Unfortunately for Gerry and his friends, they end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time and are accused of bombing a soldier's pub. Bullied by the police officers they are forced into signing a confession and are sentenced to prison along with some of Gerry's family members. In prison, Gerry and his father continue to fight to prove their innocence with the help of an attorney named Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) and the more she digs into the story the more corruption she finds in the police procedures.\n\nThe film manages to draw you in and make your blood boil due to all the injustices suffered by these characters. It is one of those movies where the tension builds up with the passing of time, but at the same time you also feel a connection growing between Gerry and his father. The film becomes more than a simple social injustice tale and turns into a character driven story focusing on the relationship between father and son. It is a shame the film has kind of been forgotten because I thought it was really well made. It never won an Academy Award, but it did receive 7 nominations including Best Picture, losing out to Schindler's List that year. Daniel Day Lewis outshines everyone in this film, although the supporting cast was very strong, especially Pete Postlethwaite who shared great chemistry with Lewis. This was an intense film that had me at the edge of my seat thanks to the way in which Sheridan tells the story and slowly draws the viewer in. The final 20 minutes of this film are perfect and Daniel Day Lewis knocks his performance out of the ball park.",

Based on a true story told in the book \"Proved Innocent,\" Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is arrested after the bombing and is forced to sign a false confession after being tortured during interrogation. His father Giuseppe (Pete Postelthwaite) is also charged as an accomplice and jailed. This is a powerful drama that resonates with great moral complexities at the ways in which an injustice can occur as the result of political pressure under the guise of security. Imprisoned together, the estranged relationship between the father and son is the center of the story. At first, Gerry is a petty thief who resents his father's overbearing nature but he gradually evolves into a crusader. There are inaccuracies that are problematic. Although the imprisonment of father and son together made the material more dramatic, in real-life they were separated. Its also a bit redundant to have another portrayal involving the British suppression of the Irish. Still, this is emotionally stirring material and the ending is effectively cathartic. Daniel Day-Lewis - speaking with a thick Irish brogue - gives a powerful performance with the dynamism of a young De Niro. Postlethwaite is quietly brilliant as he matches Day-Lewis. Written by Jim Sheridan and Terry George and directed by Sheridan. With Emma Thompson as the defense attorney who retries the case; John Lynch, Corin Redgrave, Beatie Edney, Tom Wilkinson.",

It kind of follows the same lessons that 'The Remains of the Day' but takes the ploy of innocence as well and blends it all together into one story. Following the true stories of IRA bombings in Ireland during the '70s, Gerry Conlon and his father Giuseppe are wrongly accused of murder and convicted in prison. While in there, they learn more about each other and grow closer together than before as an actual family. While telling their story, it focuses also on Gerry's case after his father's death in the prison and what will be the final verdict on the bombing incident. Dramatic and redeeming, 'In the Name of the Father' gives everyone hope on what can be done in life and what can be eventually fixed. With amazing performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postelthwaite and the staying message that the truth can set you free, 'In the Name of the Father' definitely proves itself to be one of the best of '93.",

Obviously, there is some poetic license bee used but the the general drift of the story is factual, even right down to some of the seemingly minor, at first glance, details.\n\nIt has everything a good yarn should have. In fact, it's hard to believe the British Government were committing these human rights abuses and downright racist policies directed at the Irish and their descendants long before the Bush family and the oil conglomerates got together to commit even worse atrocities against Muslims. With the full backing of Blair and the Labour party, including logistical support as well as joining in with making up the fibs to go to war and helping out with torturing British Muslims. But it's true. They did and Anti-Irish Racism is still institutionalised  in North Britland. It's prevalent in the media and throughout society. One has only to google \"Asda celtic boys club Motherwell\" to see an example of it in action.\n\nThat aside, as I said it is in and of itself a great yarn with everything - Thriller/Suspense/Tearjerker/Courtroom drama - that you would expect from a well made Hollywood blockbuster. If your Irish or have Irish connections and it doesn't raise passionate emotions in you, then there is something wrong with you. If you have no Irish connections whatsoever, it should raise the same emotions in you. Just remember that this happened and was only a small snapshot of what the British Government got up to in their dirty war with Ireland and the Irish.\n\nAlso, spare a thought for those in the world that suffer inhuman treatment at the hands of US and Brit backed right wing dictatorships that puts what we had to put up with in into the shade. I speak of rogue states like Israel, Syria, Egypt before the Arab Spring, countless countries in Africa and US backed right wing traitorous Governments in South America. We at least have the rule of law, such as it is, where we can achieve some kind of Justice, whether it be in the European Courts of Human rights. We can also march to highlight past injustices to achieve some kind of closure for the families of the victims of  British brutality. It takes the British government 40 plus years to listen, a cynical ploy so that those responsible can avoid prosecution. The problem is that the orders came from Downing Street and if Army and Police commanders are prosecuted, it would come out that Ted Heath ordered the massacres in Ballymurphy and Derry. Both Massacres were carried out by the same Parachute Regiment.",

A movie that is longer than 2 hours, watching this film is more like seeing two seperate films- where the main characters are interating with each other while in the city, up until the second story is how the Danial Day Lewis character react through his experiences during his times in prison!  Although, the cast is top notch which includes 2 time Oscar winner Danial Day-Lewis, Oscar winner Emma Thompson and the remarkable actor of the late Pete Postlethwaite, the film could've used some editing!

His father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), along with many others, is also thrown into prison because of these fallacies. His father is thrown into the same prison cell as him until he passes away. Meanwhile for years Gerry's lawyer (Emma Thompson) helps him out trying to build enough evidence to appeal and with a breakthrough in files that were suppressed from the defense during the trials, Gerry and the others imprisoned are finally let free.\n\nThere has been much talk about how many different things were made-up to create the film but even so, the film is one powerful experience. Jim Sheridan's direction in this film is some of the best work he's done and the performances are terrific throughout. As much as the story behind the IRA vs the Brits goes, all that is really set aside for what is the real focus of the film: the relationship between Gerry Conlon and his father Giuseppe. Sure they may not have actually shared a cell together, but the chemistry between Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite are what make the film great. Pete Postlethwaite gives the performance of his career that earned him a much-deserved Oscar nomination as Gerry's loving father in a performance that reeks of great subtlety. Daniel Day-Lewis counterbalances Postlethwaite with a incredibly dynamic performance, one of his best performances in what has been a career of great performances. It's a real shame that Day-Lewis lost out to Tom Hanks performance in Philadelphia as his was just so much better than Hanks'. But it hardly matters because the film speaks for itself. Emma Thompson performance as their lawyer is also noteworthy.\n\nThis one of the best, and in a way most underrated movies of the '90s with exceptional acting and a compelling story. Highly recommended viewing. 9/10",

I spent 15 years in prison for something I didn't do\".\r\n\r\nPlot: Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a young man that lives a life with no rules. Him and his family are living through a time of war between the Irish and the British government. G. Conlon is mistaken for a the leader of a terrorist group that bombed a local shop killing 5 people. The government has forced him to confess, leading up to the arrest of his entire family. Now behind bars he can face his father Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite) that isnt proud of what he has become as a person, in addition they are trying to prove their innocents knowing that they have been wrongfully and illegally accused. Emotions run deep character driven movie!\r\n\r\nMy Take: Wow, this makes Shawshank Redemption look like crap (i still like it though). This movie is perfect in every way. It starts off by showing you the life of Gerry Conlon and the lives of his family, so the character development is beyond top notch. The acting....... OMG is all im going to say. I loved every minute of this movie from beginning to end. What i especially liked was the discussions Gerry and Giuseppe had in their cells. Every emotion that has build up as a child has come out during this time of depression and stress and it gets extremely intense. Pete Postlethwaite has proven time after time that he is a very solid supporting actor and he doest fall short AT ALL in this film. On the other hand Daniel Day-Lewis's performance was freaking OUTSTANDING. Every time he spoke it felt authentic and every emotional scene i felt 100% where he was coming from, it was as if i was living his life through his own eyes. This guy is talented for sure and delivers and unforgettable performance. I also loved the deep themes of regret and forgiveness. I dont wanna give the movie away because its truly a gem.\r\n\r\nConclusion: This movie has instantly made it to my top 25 (i just gotta figure out which movie to boot ). It packs a very talented cast (overly talented) and well written story. Fans of the Shawshank Redemption will easily enjoy this little gem and see what a Great movie truly is. Everything from the opening scene, to the jailhouse scenes to the ending are full of emotions and well performed. I will never forget the effect this movie had on me and i will always hold it in a very special place (somewhere in my top 25 lol). Great movie in every way.\r\n\r\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED\r\n\r\n5/5",

            "content": "There aren't a lot of films dealing with \"The Troubles\" in Ireland, but along with 2008's \"Hunger\", \"In the Name of the Father\" is one of the best.  Director Jim Sheridan tells the true story of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a scrap metal thief who ventures to London in the mid-Seventies to escape the constant danger and despair in his native Belfast.  Not long after, when  an IRA bomb rips through a pub in Guildford killing five people, Conlon and three of his associates are snatched up by the British secret service.  Granted sweeping powers of arrest and detainment under the hastily cobbled-together \"Prevention of Terrorism Acts\", the authorities beat and coerce Conlon and his mates for seven straight days to get confessions out of them.  As if that wasn't bad enough, when Gerry's father \"Giuseppe\" Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite) visits his sister-in-law Anne Maguire in London to assist his son, the entire family is swept up by police as accomplices.  All told, eleven innocent people were eventually sent to prison for crimes they didn't commit, including Anne's son Patrick, aged 14 at the time!  The balance of the film details the trials and tribulation of Gerry and his father as they attempt to survive incarceration in a British prison and the subsequent campaign led by an English solicitor named Gareth Peirce (Emma Thomson) to see them released.  As she begins to peel back the layers of corruption we see a perfect example of why it's critical that the due process of the law cannot be compromised, even during times of terrorist threat, whether real or fear-mongered.  In the rush to see results and quell needless panic, witnesses for the defense were deep-sixed, evidence was concealed and latent confessions were ignored.  The film is a masterstroke.  Sheridan takes the time to ease the audience into the story and generate considerable pathos for his subjects.  As a corollary, they aren't depicted as saints either, but this lends more weight to their humanity.  In Sheridan's capable hands we're given all the pertinent introductions, complications, impossibilities and revelations in an economic and moving fashion.  As strife in Ireland was beginning to calm down in the early Nineties, it afforded the film-makers an opportunity to explore the Emerald Isle as a unique shooting location.  Belfast was still a bit too politically charged to host such a project but Dublin stands in nicely, with its Docklands, Sheriff Street and Kilmainham Jail offering a look of authenticity.  The actors do a stellar job.  Human chameleon Daniel-Day Lewis is stellar and once again he pays as much attention to the physical aspect of the role as he does the emoting.  Celebrated character actor Pete Postlewaite is absolutely superb as Jerry \"Giuseppe\" Conlon.  His physical deterioration in prison mirrors that of his son's mental state and it's heart-rending to consider just how wasteful it all was.  A pre-\"Nanny McPhee\" Emma Thomson proves how much of a treasure she is.  As Gareth Peirce she is single-minded, earnest and strident.  The scene in which she gains access to secret documents in Jerry's protected files due to a clerk oversight threatens to intoxicate the audience with righteous vindication.  Back when this film was released it was merely one fascinating story emerging from a dark period in the United Kingdom.  Now it's a warning cry to safeguard human rights when authorities use the intangible but ever-renewing specter of terrorism to chip away at human rights.  It's a call for us to be vigilant since, in some way, our liberties have been curtailed more dramatically in recent years and with less justification.  This is a very relevant, compelling and heartbreaking story.  Tilt: up.",

            "content": "An explosive and powerful film, it makes you take notice, rooted to the edge of your chair as you watch the senseless prejudice and heartless feeling of the British judiciary system while they imprison four innocent people. Based on the true story of Gerry Conlon and the Guildford Four, director Jim Sheridan winds through the real life events that landed a bunch of hippies in jail for murdering fifteen people at the height of the IRA's power in Ireland. This is a very strong and powerful film, because the cover-up was so huge and the misuse of power is so obvious. Not just the people prosecuted, but their family and friends, were put into prison, and that's what makes this such a nauseous film to watch. Much of what makes this heartbreaking are the great performances from the cast assembled. Daniel Day-Lewis is himself an enigma among actors, and he proves his method acting is tried and true in this role, coming off as a disenchanted young man with sincerity, but also a dogged and tired middle aged man at the offset of his sentence. Pete Postlethwaite as his father, wanting his freedom and yet remaining revered in the face of his sentencing, makes you tear up every time he holds out hope for the future. The supporting cast is also quite sincere with their performances, and the four imprisoned showed the deepest pain and regret as they are carted off to prison. The only performance that seemed off was Emma Thompson, who plays Conlon's lawyer. Though she remains restrained throughout most of the film, she ends up seeming earnestly aghast as an outsider, when she should be more composed and triumphant at the end of the film. Though some minor facts were changed, most of what remains true and gut wrenching is in this film, and it makes you sad to think it's not false.",
