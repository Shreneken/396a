    "summary": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) is a remarkably talented young Viennese composer who unwittingly finds a fierce rival in the disciplined and determined Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). Resenting Mozart for both his hedonistic lifestyle and his undeniable talent, the highly religious Salieri is gradually consumed by his jealousy and becomes obsessed with Mozart's downfall, leading to a devious scheme that has dire consequences for both men.",

Some fantastic supporting performances as well. \n\nThe final scene between Mozart and Salieri, as the latter tries to keep up and Mozart demonstrates his brilliance was mesmerising. \n\nSalieri's battle against God for making him mediocre is really great viewing and culminates in a bitterly ironic conclusion which is again wonderfully played. \n\nIt's also very funny- the party scene with Mozart's father's mask showing sad, then turned happy then his father's face furious underneath was hilarious. \n\nDirectors cut is slightly too long. Salieri's opera scenes could have been shorter, as could the comedic theatre scenes before Mozart goes to work for Emmanuel. The more about Mozart's music it is the better I think. It also takes major liberties with true history but you know, it works, so...",

The plot is interesting but I'd say its worth seing for the visual aspects alone - not to mention the enjoyable classic and operatic music featured. Its certainly an atmospheric watch. There are even some comedic moments at times, that made me laugh. \n\nMozart is portrayed as a vulgar person, someone who easily disregarded other peoples regulations and opinions, which I didn't think much of. I certainly hadn't realised Mozarts personality was how it appears in this film.\n\nOn the downside, Mozarts laugh is very grating (a bit like Jimmy Carrs - very high pitched) but overall its certainly an interesting watch and I quite enjoyed it. Also, I did feel it dragged a bit towards the end, in that at a running time of about three hours, it is perhaps a little long winded but I certainly enjoyed the depictions of his musical presentations/operas and the like.",

            "content": "I adore classical music, and Mozart is one of my favourite composers. When I came across Amadeus in my local charity shop, I knew I had to buy it. I watched it, and I loved it from start to finish. It is true it is not necessarily a true depiction of Mozart's life, but I was so blown away by the quality of the acting, sets, costumes and music that I forgot about that. The film is just gorgeous to look at, Vienna in the film (Prague in real life) looks beautiful, but the sets and costumes are colourful and lavish. The music is utterly majestic, from the Marriage of Figaro, Queen of the Night(brilliantly sung in what is one of the most difficult colouratura arias ever), Requiem in D minor to Don Giovanni, it was a feast to the ears. The script I thought was of exceptional quality particularly during the finale of Marriage of Figaro(one of the most beautiful tender moments in any opera is where the countess forgives her husband), and the direction was very fine. As many reviewers have pointed out, this is more about the mediocrity and envy of Salieri than it is of the eccentric genius of Mozart, thus the story was compelling and intriguing. The acting is wonderful; Tom Hulce is excellent as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, yeah his laugh is a tad grating, but I loved the manic and eccentric interpretation Hulce gave. Elizabeth Berridge is suitably petite and alluring as wife Constanze while Jeffrey Jones is delightful as Emperor Joseph II. For me though, F Murray Abraham gave the film's best performance, for he was absolutely outstanding as Salieri. Overall, brilliant film, gorgeous to watch, amazing music and essentially a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Antonio Salieri - a pious, polite working musician - allows himself to be utterly corrupted by the sting of professional jealousy. Comfortable in his position as Emperor Joseph II's court composer, Salieri is intoxicated by the delicate, masterful work of a contemporary, then repulsed to learn of the man's crude, lascivious personality.\n\nThe object of this adjoining scorn and adoration, of course, is the famed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and the very essence of his being offends Salieri to the core. In Mozart, he sees affirmation of both God's majesty (the sublime compositions) and inequality (granting such gifts to one who appears so unworthy), a bald contradiction which drives him to renounce his faith and lash out at man and maker alike. Why should one work so hard, stressing and grinding to perfect a single phrase, when another seemingly plucks finished masterpieces from thin air, giggling and mocking all the while?\n\nIt's an excellent subject, subtle but profound, that's masterfully realized on the screen. F. Murray Abraham plays Salieri, stiff and conceited but also visibly moved by the music of the moment. An orchestra has the power to deliver a spiritual experience for some, and Abraham doesn't just make us believe he's feeling it; he helps us feel it, too. Tom Hulce is his counter-balance, the raw and mercurial Mozart. Hulce breezily personifies the duplicity that frustrates his rival, directing an opera with vigor and passion and then almost immediately spoiling the mood with a bad joke and a loud, shrill, inappropriate laugh. Mozart's laugh is like a bucket of cold water, dumped over the room. It alone speaks to why he's never accepted into polite society, despite the wonders he weaves on the podium.\n\nThese twin leads make for an exciting contrast, each lifted by the presence of the other. No wonder they were both nominated for the same Academy Award. They are these roles. Similarly small wonder that the film itself took home the prize for 1984's Best Picture. It's a moving, enveloping work that doesn't feel half as long as its imposing run time, nor as stiff as its classical origins.",

Although I was kind of bummed to learn that a decent chunk of this movie is not true \ud83d\ude1e\n\nThis movie would be nearly flawless if it wasn't SO DAMN LONG. There's at least like 30 minutes of unnecessary opera performances that don't add anything to the plot. They're interesting to watch, but it's not worth the extra runtime.\n\nThe performances are wonderful, especially Tom Hulce who brings so much humanity and relatability to his character. The script does a great job of inviting sympathy for all of the characters without ever feeling one-sided.\n\nAnd of course, the score is magical. This feels like a movie written by musicians and I loved that my musical background let me appreciate the nuances of what characters are saying and listening to. That being said, I think the film does a good job of making it relatable for folks without a musical background too.\n\nEven though its runtime doesn't do it any favors, Amadeus is a fantastic biopic and an unexpected gem.",

It's been years since I last watched this movie and although I always liked it, I didn't appreciate its beauty \u2014 in both plot and appearance \u2014 and found its run-time to be a drag. As noted, this is a review of the director's cut, which includes approximately twenty more minutes. This added time doesn't impact the film in a negative way. The sets are stunning. Vienna is the most \"imperial\" feeling city I've ever been to and Amadeus, set during the Holy Roman Empire times, does its grandeur justice; for the record, \"wig culture\" seems super fun. Our titular character, wunderkind Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), is not what we expect. When we first meet him, he's chasing a girl (Elizabeth Berridge), is making fart jokes, and erupting in a grating, high-pitched laugh that seems to take a bit of Salieri's (F. Murray Abraham) soul with each soprano-screech. It is actually through Salieri's recounting (to a priest) of his time spent with Mozart in the royal court. Salieri, the court composer of Emperor Joseph II, both admires and loathes Mozart for his talent \u2014 he also hates God for giving the little shit his abilities. The ebb of flow of Salieri's detestation and appreciation for Mozart moves the film. Both Abraham and Hulce give excellent performances \u2014 I especially liked Abraham when Salieri is old (he looks like his rotting away in his seat) and when Mozart is feverishly scribbling some of the greatest compositions the world will ever know by candlelight, in debt, and drunk. The apogee of this relationship, however, is the single best scene of the film. Mozart isn't giggling, but on his deathbed, letting his genius avail itself, and Salieri isn't plotting, he's absorbing; they are co-dependent, completing the famed Requiem. The ending, with Salieri \"absolving mediocrities everywhere,\" is perfect. I think the concept of this movie has turned off the casual viewer, but I promise Amadeus is a piece you must see once before you die.",

The sets and costumes are fantastic, the script if witty and touching, the cinematography is beautiful, and the performances of Hulce and Abraham are top-notch.

The excellent script is bolstered by virtuoso performances by the makeup, costuming, and set decorating departments, who portray the decadence of the 18th-century nobility with an elegance I have only seen before in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. The only reason I don't give this movie a perfect score is that neither the theatrical nor the director's cut find a happy balance between giving the audience sufficient context and not appearing self-indulgent by including unnecessary scenes.",

            "content": "Amadeus is a film classic from 1984 and, after One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the second masterpiece by Czech director Milos Forman. As the title suggests, the film tells the story of the rapid rise of the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the 17th century and how he achieved status as one of the greatest austrian icons in his far too short life. His story is told from the perspective of the ageing Antonio Salieri, who like Mozart was a classical composer. The latter talks to a priest who takes action after Salieri claims to have killed Mozart.\n\nAmadeus is basically about nothing other than the rivalry between the two alpha dogs Mozart (Tom Hulce) and Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), although the former is never really aware of this rivalry. The two characters could hardly be more different. On the one hand, there is the clearly older and highly ambitious Salieri, who does everything to push through his music and, through his strong faith, always sees God as his guardian angel. On the other side is the very young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, an impulsive daredevil with a very own sense of humour. In him Salieri sees a threat and despite his admiration for Mozart's works he does not understand how such a ruffian can receive so much recognition. This fact causes Salieri's faith in God to dwindle until he finally throws his principles completely overboard and even burns his Jesus cross. Mozart hardly notices Salieri's envy throughout the film, but is preoccupied with his own problems. As the husband of the lively Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) and head of the family, he is constantly courted and showered with commissions, but his playfulness and inability to save money get him into trouble. Combined with his almost addictive devotion to music, he consistently leads a life at the limit. Hulce and Abraham's performances, like their characters, are very different, yet both impeccable. Hulce is emotional, passionate and unpredictable, while Abraham is particularly convincing as the younger Salieri with subtlety and diabolical calm.\n\nThe long-distance duel between the two composer-geniuses is surprisingly exciting. Because of their few interactions with each other, you never know what will come next and the ending is completely open. Although Amadeus is based on Mozart's true story, some events are not accurate or even fictional. While historical inaccuracy hurts many films, that is not the case here at all. The plot is too involving and realistic for that. Accompanied by the wonderful classical music that runs throughout the whole film and beautiful costumes and impressions of old Vienna, Amadeus is a film that has it all: suspense, brilliant performances, terrific music and impressive aesthetics for such an old film. This ensures that in the viewing process you don't even notice the epic running length of 150 minutes.",

Unlike later Best Picture winner Braveheart, Amadeus is not striving for historical accuracy, and instead uses real people to tell a largely fictionalised story. It's a tale of professional jealousy, brilliantly acted out by its 2 leads. Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abrahams both play incredibly talented men with vastly different personalities, and Salieri's increasingly malevolent envy of Mozart talents manifests itself as a need to destroy him. It's a fantastic power play that allows the characters to continue developing as the film goes on, and events become increasingly tragic as Mozart descends further into his own personal Hell. It's a beautiful film to watch, and while the runtime is a little excessive (I watched the 3-hour Directors cut), the story and the musical numbers are so compelling that you'll barely notice how much time has passed. While it's not a history lesson by any means, it's a fantastic insight into a pivotal time in the development of classical music, and a glimpse into the tragic life of one humanities most beloved geniuses.",

            "content": "Milos Forman's \"Amadeus\" is an ambitious, lavish and powerfully constructed biopic that offers a fascinating look at the life of classical composer Mozart. With his eighth feature, director Milos Forman crafted a clever biographical drama about a legendary composer that holds up today as a modern classic. Using gorgeous cinematography, Forman draws viewers into the world of a dedicated classical composer in the 18th Century. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's period setting. Forman showcases immense control over the production sets, costumes and music concert sequences, paying heartfelt tribute to the legacy of Mozart. Peter Shaffer's original screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses a clever framing device to tell the story of the composer from the tainted perspective of his rival. It is hard to not praise the powerful performances from the cast. F. Murray Abraham delivers one of the best performances of his career as Antonio Salieri. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the cunning, jealousy and resentment of a competitive composer that envies the success of his long-standing rival. Tom Hulce is equally excellent in the iconic role of the classical composer. With his infectious laughter, Hulce brings out the passion, joy and larger-than-life persona of the iconic musician. Although \"Amadeus\" is undeniably an astonishing biographical drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. At nearly three hours, it suffers from a lengthy running-time that occasionally tests the viewer's patience. While the film's length is almost justified by its epic scope, it does affect the pacing and cause the film to lose momentum towards the end. Nevertheless, fans of the classical musician will definitely appreciate \"Amadeus\" and so will movie-goers seeking exhilarating entertainment. At a time when modern audiences seem to have forgotten Mozart, it's a rousing reminder that the centuries-old stories of controversial classical composers are worth retelling on the big-screen.",

            "content": "Amadeus is probably my favorite costume drama of all time. It is a work of such cinematic genius that it's impossible to not rave about it's outstanding significance. Based on one of my favorite plays, Amadeus is based on a rumor that Italian composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) and his rivalry with and plot to murder Wolfgang Mozart (Tom Hulce). What I adore about Milos Forman's second Oscar-winning outing is that it combines history with fiction, while also staying true to Mozart's legacy. First of all, Mozart while he did put his blood on his music, his attitude was described as vulgar, crude, and immature, according to the letters to his cousin. Second, Mozart had been exposed to music at a very young age, so much so that his childhood was spent financially supporting his family. Third, Count Franz von Walsegg, not a masked Salieri, assigned Mozart the Requiem for his dead wife so he can tarnish his reputation and take credit for writing the piece. Fourth, Salieri was more popular than Mozart during the 18th Century Austria, as he was married in nobility, he gave piano lessons for free, and his operas were more successful. Finally, the rumor that Salieri killed Mozart originated from the latter composer's letters showing resentment to the former and a letter written to Constanza before Mozart's death, leading to Salieri's suicide attempt decades later. Amadeus is the most fantastic piece of historical fiction ever made in cinema, excluding the lesser Director's Cut, which was released twenty years later. \n\n(5 Nipples of Venice out of 5)",

There is so much more to like from the production design, the set design, the costumes and music. The costumes were so well done i felt the time period and loved watching the dancing sequences. Its a very entertaining and intriguing movie. Two different lives and how religion plays an important part. Saltieri not understanding why god allowed Mozart his genius. There are of course some historical inaccuracies but nevertheless i enjoyed the movie and was riveted to the end. The many operas are very well done and showcase Mozarts talent and usher a new talent in that era. The jealousy of Saltieri fuels the story and we watch as he gets more bitter and spiteful. Watching him write what Mozart wants from his next opera as Moazrt is dying is a great scene. Saltieri looks proud as his helps, but also looks a little lost like he can't ever compete with this great genius. This will in the end make Saltieri made and unhinged as we open the story with his attempted suicide and trying to tell his story. Its a shame that both lead actors could not has been awarded an Oscar. Both are intriguing to watch, Hulce showing a youthful exuberance and passion alongside Abraham's sinister and underhand character. We see Mozart struggling to make money, writing constantly as his love as music which would in the end be his downfall. We see the rumours spreading about Mozart, most made up by Saltieri to stop Mozart teaching others. The fact the priest does not recognise Saltieri music compared to Mozart starts the film off with hints of jealous yet to come. The proudest moment of his life is working with Mozart before he died.   The way Mozarts is huge figure over him  is shown through the giant picture in his house and looms over him. It enables him to write a opera but also enables Saltieri to manipulate. We feel for Saltieri that he can never be the composer Mozart is, but we also feel for Mozart that his genius is only be fully realised after his death. Lastly much praise must be a script and the cinemography. Both enabling a film to stay rich, entertaining and funny for three hours,  with many scenes brilliantly filmed and showcasing a great era of people and music. A sure delight.",

They are Hair (1979) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996).  And now, added as another favorite is his Oscar winning Best Picture awarded in 1985, Amadeus.  \n\nI have to be honest in admitting that for the first two hours I kept trying to figure out what exactly I was watching.  What was I supposed to be taking away from it?  Was this a drama, a comedy, a dark comedy, a period piece, a satire, a farce, a biography? Upon reflection the answer is yes!  And no!  Letting go of my need to make the film be only one particular genre over another allowed the concluding third hour to be even more engrossing.  And then of course, the final three minutes place a huge enlightening bow on the entire multi-sided gift that is Amadeus. [No spoilers!]  \nThe movie is based on the Broadway play of the same name, and while it's about real people, the feud between the two main characters is purely fictional for the purpose of telling an extremely well crafted story.  Italian composer Antonio Salieri (F Murray Abraham) is a man struggling with his spiritual beliefs as he believes that creative genius is evidence of the presence of the Christian god.  He longs to experience such genius, but when it is presented to him in the form of the rapscallion Austrian composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Salieri isn't gratified.  Instead he's filled with anger and jealousy which only serves to keep him further from obtaining enlightenment and satisfaction in his own musical endeavors. \n\nF Murray Abraham is outstanding, and won an Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal.  His scenes are heavy and brooding, filled with deceit and longing.  The film is told through the eyes of his character.  Scenes centered on Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) on the other hand are light and seasoned with frivolity and childish whimsy.  Hulce is brilliant at portraying Mozart's reluctant but necessary engagement of social norms and class based protocols.  And that uncomfortable, high pitched laugh is priceless!  He too was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal.  When both actors share scenes, the chemistry is an incomparable delight, and the question of who is victor is always unresolved.  \nFrom a standpoint of all things cinematic, this movie is solidly one of the finest I've seen.  Acting, directing, soundtrack, storytelling and pacing are all integrated with the same precision and technique as the very musical compositions central to the movie's plot.",

We do receive an intimate portrait of who Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is, but from the point of view of an old man, who finds himself and his life's work dissolving and becoming forgotten in the passage of time.  We find poor Salieri in an asylum after attempting suicide, giving his confession to a priest, who patiently listens to Salieri's battle with God.  As a young, pious man, he prays for the gift of divine music and providence seems to open up to him, until he encounters a man who is a mockery of everything he is, yet channels the divine muse.  Finding himself nothing more than a mediocrity, we see how his soul descends into a murderous jealousy against Mozart and a righteous rage against God.  Upon concocting a plan to steal Mozart's glory, Salieri finds himself defeated by God himself, who would rather destroy his messenger, rather than allow him (Salieri) to share in God's glory.  Consigned to a world where he must now witness his defeat, he realizes (in an apparent reconciliation with God and himself) that his role is one of \"patron saint of mediocrities everywhere\". \n\nIt is a compelling character study not so much of Mozart, but of Salieri and, indeed, anyone who finds himself or herself in the existential crisis of having one's life's work fade before their eyes.  The music and cinematography is beyond outstanding, the screenplay is leisurely, but not at all slow or plodding, the editing between the past and the present is truly a work of art.",

Milos Forman famously directed another Best Picture winner in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) but he outdoes himself here as he takes a stage play and successfully adapts it to the screen with stunning results. This was by far the best film of those nominated in 1984 and it earned the response it got from Laurence Olivier as he announced Best Picture. I would recommend that everybody see this film as even though it is three hours long, I watched the director's cut, it really hits you hard and earns the time it takes to tell it's story.\n\nAntonio Salieri, F. Murray Abraham, feels angry at God himself for blessing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Tom Hulce, with incredible talent as he acts childishly in his personal life while implanting Salieri with the desire to be a composer. He promises Mozart that he will support him and is amazed by his revolutionary compositions but his own selfishness prevents him from actually telling his superiors to let Mozart bring his creations to the stage. Meanwhile Mozart's personal life falls apart as he suffers under the weight of his overbearing father even after his death and falls prey to heroin addiction which damages his once strong bond with his devoted wife Constanze, Elizabeth Berridge. Salieri is able to work with Mozart on a composition as he dies but blames himself for Mozart's death and still hasn't worked through his anger over his own mediocrity.\n\nWhether the film is historically accurate or not is unimportant as the story relies on your knowledge of Mozart as a legendary composer and your relative lack of knowledge of Salieri to tell a story about jealousy and how great art can overcome even that. The feeling of being overawed by another person because of how unfathomably great they are at what you yearn to understand as deeply as they do is a common feeling for many. The feeling of being mediocre and the anger of seeing another person effortlessly create something brilliant with little to no effort while you put all of your time and effort into producing something half decent are on show here. The story may not be real but the emotions are and they will connect with anybody who has experienced jealousy or envy of another.\n\nAnother reason that the film works so well is that it uses the music of Mozart to great effect. Obviously any film using his compositions has the benefit of them being some of the most iconic of all time but this film really helps you appreciate his work as we get extended scenes of the operas being performed and see how he would have composed his work. We know why men would give up so much to bring their compositions to the stage and why a stunning piece of music would push a man to forget his own desires because the film gives us reason to and that's the story that should be told when we look at the lives of musical artists. \n\nPeter Shaffer's screenplay is fantastic as he takes his successful stage play and brings it to life for the screen making the necessary adjustments to have the film feel cinematic. The credit is also owed of course to Forman who stages each scene with very clear intentions and feels as though he has a very real connection to the story. Everybody working behind the scenes worked together to produce this dazzling film and it helped that the actors were pretty terrific in their roles. Hulce brings humanity to a figure who is often seen as being above humanity in many ways while Abraham is the worst in all of us as he roots against a great man and wishes pain upon those who are better than him. \n\nI would have given Best Picture to this film over the rest of the nominees in a heartbeat and I think that this was one of the few examples of the Academy making the right choice.",

The film was directed by Milo\u00c5\u00a1 Forman who also directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The film stars Tom Hulce as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri.\n\nThe story in my opinion was both extremely entertaining to watch unfold, and portrayed incredibly well. The story I also found really interesting and very intriguing.\n\nThe acting was really strong especially Tom Hulce as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, I felt that he gave one of the greatest performances that I've seen to date. \n\nThe characters in my opinion were written and portrayed really well, and were also really interesting and enjoyable.\n\nThe cinematography was really strong and grand with some outstanding shots of the characters and sets.\n\nThe set designs and props were Magnificent, from the opera house to Mozart's house.\n\nPersonally I found the costumes and makeup perfect, from the characters everyday clothes to the costumes and makeup for the various plays and operas.\n\nThe film also had a very unique style, from the various music, to the way they use Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's character.\n\nIn my opinion the music was great, from the music itself, to the way they fit it into the scenes and emotion of the film.\n\nThe film also had some strong comedy especially from Tom Hulce as Wolfgang, which at points had me laughing out loud.\n\nThe film at points also had some really strong atmosphere especially in the third act.\n\nThe film at the end is also a little emotional, but in my opinion not enough to cry over.\n\nThe film I also found really enjoyable and I hope to watch it again and again very soon.\n\nOver all I give it a \n10/10\n100%\n5/5\n\nA masterpiece, just like Mozart's music",

Yet, of all the projects Forman has been involved with, none has striven for and achieved as much as Amadeus. No matter how many additional great movies he makes, he is unlikely to surpass this one. Whether you choose the original 1984 theatrical version or the extended Director's Cut, you won't find a better motion picture depiction of genius, art, and the artist. Not only is Amadeus a fascinating character study, but it also features a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions in the twisted triangle of Mozart, Salieri, and God.

            "content": "A monumental cinematic experience overflowing with glorious music (obviously), resplendent production design, lavish costuming, impeccable performances, and gorgeous cinematography. That rare bird whose success is matched only by its ambition and whose creativity is equaled by its craftsmanship, an fabulous film fit for its formidable subject. Like Salieri, when confronted with the task of appraising and critiquing a work of such unbridled and overwhelming inspiration as this, one cannot help but feel inadequate to the task. From capo to coda, the whole thing is so breathless and inspired that at best we struggle to keep up as it flies through ideas, more often than not getting swept up in our own enjoyment. In this way, the film is like its source material, its eccentricities and intricacies inundating the viewer as Mozart's \"too many notes\" dumbfound the listener-yet remove even one scene and the whole would be diminished, our inability to speak to the genius of this material thus being a gift of silence so as better to hear the voice of inspiration in the music. This is not to say that the film is ever as pretentious or austere as the times it portrays might suggest; rather, just as Mozart's music and character juxtapose the vulgar and comical (what Salieri calls his \"rusty squeezebox\" harmony) with the sublime and delightful (\"It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God\"), so too does the film find a perfect balance between the original and the biographical, the playful and the serious, the composer's spirit and the facts of his life.\n\nWhat a formidable task Forman has given himself, to make a film that echoes the spirit of Mozart's work, a cinematic experience with the same energy and cunning and charm in its visuals and dialogue as the composer provides in the soundtrack. How much easier it would have been to focus solely on the tragic soul that is Salieri: Certainly his is the more common tale, the journey of a poor country boy who defies his upbringing and family expectations to pursue his heart and his art, a typical rags to riches story where the transcendence of art is the elevation of the artist above his station, which here gets passed over entirely in the first few minutes of the film. We have seen this movie dozens of times and Hollywood elites have honed it into a blockbuster formula, so much so that part of the brilliance in Forman's AMADEUS is precisely the straight rejection of this trope, not only in that Mozart is treated as a child prodigy whose genius is recognized and rewarded immediately-only to be practically punished for his dedication to artistic integrity in a riches to rags subversion of the genre-but moreover because Salieri's aesthetic failure and personal frustration (even as he continues to enjoy social success) stems precisely from an inability to escape his formulaic nature, his grounding in a formula.\n\nPerhaps this dialectic-the genius and the craftsman, the inspired and the formulaic-is best exhibited in the scenes where the two composers first meet, and, in the end, when they part ways forever. In the first moment, we see Salieri standing inflexibly over the shoulder of Emperor Joseph II, who rigidly hammers away at a rigid march composed for the occasion, staring at the sheet music intently so as to get every note right, Salieri's music coming across as technically correct if inflexible and muddled; Mozart, on the other hand, forgoes the stiff staves of sheet music and plays the music back perfectly-beyond perfectly, actually, as the younger composer begins to improvise and elevate the piece, breaking it apart and breaking the rules and breaking Salieri's self-composure as he does. Even when the two rivals come together at the movie's climax, with Mozart in his deathbed soon to be as lifeless and stiff as Salieri's music, the older maestro can barely keep up with the young genius, struggles to put into writing-that is to say, to make formulaic and followable-the flow of Mozart's genius, struggles even to make sense of how these notes will relate.\n\nHere and throughout, the movie suggests that creative genius cannot be controlled, cannot be made to fit a formula, that it, rather, like divinity itself, holds sway over our helpless desires and designs. In this way, AMADEUS is very much in line with so much of Forman's earlier oeuvre, especially CUCKOO'S NEXT-which we get hints of when the camera passes through the elderly Salieri's sanitarium-and the director's Czech films. In all of these works, Forman depicts a society of stifling hierarchy and bureaucracy, which dull creativity and personal expression, but which can never fully contain the genius of life.",

It is rich on technical aspects like costume design, production design, background score, make-up design and editing. The script is elaborate, satisfying and justified thoroughly through the complex character's perspective whose narration is the window of writer where it can be and is brutally honest and clears up all that is hoax and distraction. Peter Shaffer; the writer, has done an appreciative work on writing this finely detailed script that is full of tactics but is surpassed by its brilliant execution by Milos Forman whose work pays off well in here. The performance objective is scored majestically by F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce, in their parallel role are doing some of their best work.

            "content": "An Ode to Mozart\nTo borrow a notion of Mozart's style from respected classical musicologist Charles Rosen, Milos Foreman's motion picture of the Peter Shaffer play is full of the \"violence and sensuality\" characteristic of Mozart's music. In addition, by Foreman brilliantly documenting an appreciation of the \"supreme expressions of suffering and terror\" of the main characters in this story, we receive a philosophy of life that is \"shockingly voluptuous\". This movie is a mirror of human despair and delight. As Mozart's music does, so too does Foreman's ode to this exceptional musician achieve a harmony we wish would more often flow through our lives. At the same time, he delivers our compliment exuberantly fresh. This film could even turn a staunch hater of classical music or commonly glum nihilist into its most fervent recruiter.\nHaving cut his throat in an attempted suicide, aging former Viennese court composer Salieri (F Murray Abraham) is sent off to an insane asylum while crying out to God and the world that he is guilty of murdering composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). While recovering at the asylum, a benign and sympathetic parish priest comes to take Salieri's confession. Following his usual rhetoric, the priest says, \"All men are equal in God's eyes\" which raises the learned composer's eyebrow and sparks the story of how Salieri came to know Mozart, why he believes all men are not equal in God's eyes, and why Salieri believes it was he who ought to be blamed for the great composer's death. After telling us about his rise from a provincial Italian town to court composer for Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffery Jones), we learn about his adoration for his young contemporary. When the opportunity arises for Salieri to meet his idol, he discovers he is aghast at Mozart's complexity-how can a \"giggling, dirty minded creature\" compose works that are so sublime one may believe they could hear the voice of God? Split between adoration and rancor, Salieri confesses to the patient priest of his plot to learn of Mozart's secrets, of throwing every obstacle in his way, of hoping to find the opportunity to steal Mozart's last piece of music and claim it for his own-all at the cost of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\nWhat truly makes this film a masterpiece is the point of view playwright and screenwriter Peter Shaffer decided on to portray Mozart-through the character of Salieri. Salieri is more like most of us than the gifted Mozart. Regular people generally believe that faith in our family, our institutions, even in our religious convictions will yield some level of greatness in our chosen field because everyone applauds our efforts. However, when we come across someone truly singular, we suddenly find ourselves covered by a dark feeling that our very purpose in life has been cast into shadow and doubt. Surviving this knock at our ego, we retaliate with envy. Naturally, we try to oppress this envy; Salieri does not. And we love him (and Abraham's portrayal) for it. Salieri plays puppet master to Mozart's pain and suffering, using every event in the great composer's life in Vienna to test his genius. For instance, after spying on Mozart's family at a masquerade, Salieri sees that Wolfgang's father wore a completely black costume. Later, while still grieving from his father's death, Salieri dons the same costume, visits Wolfgang one twilight evening, cool and solemn, to commission a \"Mass for the Dead\". Now almost bankrupt, needing to feed his wife and child, he accepts this request. Like Salieri, who seems to ignore his conscience, we observe Mozart's suffering without pity. We know what Salieri is doing is unethical yet by the very nature of cinema, we cannot interfere with the relationships between these all-too-true characters. As with many great films, the motivations of villain and hero are harmoniously clear and \"Amadeus\" sits atop this tradition.\nBe warned. This is a work of fiction, loosely based on Mozart's life. The film does not document a realistic relationship between Mozart and Salieri; it does, however, illustrate the spirit of longing to be better than oneself. Salieri may not have actually been before Mozart's deathbed to transcribe the voice of God (i.e. the most perfect music), but we are all glad to experience the possibility if it could have happened. In real life, Salieri and Mozart were close enough to have even composed together a cantata for voice and piano called \"Per la ricuperata salute di Ophelia\". So, if anyone wondered if Salieri actually had the opportunity to co-create with Mozart, the answer is yes. However, Shaffer's \"what if\" scenario is much more fantastic, engaging, and rewarding.\nSuitable for anytime you or your family needs to have their spirits raised...and for creative types, \"Amadeus\" will help let flow one's creative juices.

            "content": "Milos Forman achieved directorial greatness with his 1984 classic Amadeus. The film starring F. Murray Abraham, and Tom Hulce tells the story of a jealous mediocre composer who believes he is responsible for the demise of perhaps the greatest composer to ever live. Amadeus is a film that will dazzle the entire way through, more than earning each of its honors from Oscar, including its top prize. Amadeus is a stark beauty, an instant classic, and one of the most visually stunning films of all time.\n\nAmadeus opens with the suicide attempt of Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) leading to a confession that has been weighing on his heart for years. Salieri, a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), lived his life insanely jealous of his exceptionally gifted counterpart. Salieri confesses to the Priest sent to converse with him after his suicide attempt, that he devised several plans in order to stunt Mozart's success. Salieri was fiercely jealous of Mozart's ability, and how seemingly natural that ability came to him, as Salieri devoted his life to composition mastery yet couldn't hold a candle to Mozart's compositions. Salieri promised his chastity to God in hopes of being imparted the gift of music by the hand of Christ. Salieri enjoys a comfortable living and career as court composer to Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The envy of Salieri eventually engulfs his entire being; he is dumbfounded as to why God could choose such an immature, petulant child to instill his most precious musical talents in. His envy has led Salieri to wage a war against the Christ he devoted his life to, and an urgency to bring about the downfall of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nAmadeus is a beautifully striking film, thanks in no small part to its reliance on natural lighting. Amadeus was filmed solely using natural lighting and it benefits immensely from this choice. Amadeus taught me that lighting in a film can have the most dramatic impact, even acting as a character on its own. I am moved by the lighting every time I watch the film, and it is my favorite part of revisiting it. Amadeus achieves a curious feat, it is a biopic in which one cares little about biographic inaccuracies. There are no historical records to indicate that the  relationship between Salieri and Mozart was contentious as it appears to be on screen, yet, the story is so engaging that the audience is not tallying the mistakes the film makes. It's more than an engaging story, however, that keeps the audience from becoming upset at the miscues the film fires; Amadeus strikes the delicate balance of giving each principle character their due in the film. Mozart and Salieri are deeply flawed, yet gifted individuals and Foreman brilliantly expresses both sides of each man. \n\nThe crux of the film has to do with Salieri's perception of God and the characters relation to God. Salieri makes a deal with God at a young age promising to devote his life fully to Christ in exchange for divine inspiration of his musical compositions. Salieri begins his devotion by solely studying music and vows to remain chaste, exercising extreme monastic-like discipline in his daily life. Salieri is pleased with the gifts he feels have been handed to him by Christ until he becomes aware of the superior expertise of Mozart. Salieri becomes obsessed with the idea of Mozart and anticipates the day in which he can meet the one God has given such musical talent to. When he finally meets Mozart, Salieri is shocked and disgusted by how juvenile the prodigy is. The interesting aspect of Salieri's repugnance is that he is so revolted by Mozart's childlike behavior, yet his fixation on the composer comes across like a son and outshone by his father's (God's) favorite child. Salieri knows he does not possess the talent Mozart does, yet believes himself to be more deserving of the superior talents. He begins to unwind right before the audience's eyes, decomposing from the realization that he has lived a life promised to another, yet, intensely unfulfilled. It is this great multi-layered portrayal of a jilted man that earned F. Murray Abraham an Academy Award for his role as Salieri; the role also won a Tony for Ian McKellen's brilliant portrayal of Salieri on Broadway. F. Murray Abraham played the part wonderfully and deserves each of the many accolades he received for his turn in the role. The standout for me, however, is the multi-faceted Tom Hulce. Hulce plays the childlike, workaholic, unsophisticated, professional composer. The rapid-fire shifts between facets of the boy genius are extremely well-acted by Hulce. A performance that necessitated so many opposite mindsets is no easy feat, yet one Hulce mastered with ease. As brilliant as Abraham and Hulce were in their roles, it would have been interesting to see Ian McKellen and Tim Curry reprising their stage roles in this film. (I wonder why neither were selected to star in the film having given acclaimed performances on Broadway) \n\nThe period costumes of the film were perfect, the elaborate set designs showcasing the time were brilliant, and it nearly goes without saying that a film about one of the greatest composers of all-time has a magnificent score. The makeup department had the dual challenge of creating an aged Salieri, and an ill Mozart, both feats perfectly achieved. Amadeus has a myriad of factors that could work against it. The film is three hours long, is narrated, involves heavily on flashbacks, and shows several compositions-operas mostly, of the featured composer's works. Yet, given the issues that may arise from these aspects of the film, Amadeus does not suffer for them. Amadeus is excellently paced, brilliantly illustrated through narrated flashbacks providing an in-depth look at the people involved in the story, and are wonderfully brought to life by seeing the pieces the composers worked so tirelessly on. \n\nBiopics seem to rarely show the subject's death, but for Amadeus, it was almost a necessity to show the death of Mozart. It was through Mozart's decline towards death, in which we see Salieri attempting to aid in Mozart's composition of his final requiem, that we see just how superior Mozart was to Salieri, in Salieri's mind, anyway. Salieri referred to Mozart's natural music ability as if he had been picked to take musical dictation from God, this seemed to be supported when Salieri saw original copies of Mozart's work that showed no marks of corrections or signs of error. As Salieri is working with Mozart, he is taking dictation from the ailing Mozart, and having trouble keeping up with him or even understanding what he is to write; Mozart can hear the melodies he is creating in his head, a skill in which Salieri does not possess. It is never clearer than in his final moments with Mozart that Salieri, while being a gifted composer, has nowhere near the natural aptitude of his counterpart, Mozart. Given that the film is told from Salieri's forsaken viewpoint, Amadeus is a narrative that explores the raw emotion of a man who devoted his life to an art form that abandoned him and is the most painfully beautiful illustration of such I have ever seen.",

There's so much emotion expressed through the music, and any time there were lyrics they spoke directly to what was happening in the film. It was brilliant planning and it made Amadeus a joy to watch. I also adored the framing device, because Salieri perfectly explains his entire motivation in only a few minutes with the priest. There were a few acting performances that I struggled with, in fact some people seemed totally anachronistic in their speech patterns. Sadly, the worst of these was Tom Hulce as the titular character. While he softens and becomes tolerable late in the movie, I find his characterization painful to watch. It has been explained to me, in the time since I watched the film, that this was intentional, because we're supposed to be seeing Mozart through Salieri's eyes. I just felt a better actor could have played the character as annoying without making me cringe involuntarily. Luckily F. Murray Abraham was there totally classing up the film. He was remarkable. I loved every acting choice he made, and noticed a lot of subtlety in his performance. With just a slight tweak in casting I would anxiously seek out the opportunity to watch this movie again. Amadeus is definitely a quality movie, and one I'm glad I finally marked off my list of shame.",

            "content": "With all its colorful and dazzling visual and audio flare, Amadeus is one for the ages.  But I never really connected to the characters, and that's where it fails for me.\n\nWinning 8 Oscars in 1985 and numerous other accolades, it's safe to say Amadeus is one of the more beloved films of the 80's.  It also comes from the great director behind One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Miles Forman.  But what Amadeus lacks is subtly.  I understand a film about grand-scale music and opera's needs to have a unique identity, but I found Tom Hulce's eccentric title role-performance to lack the human touch.\n\nOf course, Amadeus isn't strictly about Mozart himself, it deals with his \"rivalry\" with Italian composer, Antonio Salieri and the various trials and tribulations of Mozart's wish to display his talents to the world and particularly, the Roman Emperor.  These events are told in flashbacks by Salieri as he was recently committed to an Insane Asylum after attempted suicide.  As far as we know, most of the events of the film are highly fictionalized or exaggerated.  Normally, I don't mind such a choice in storytelling, but it seemed to bother me this time around.\n\nWhat didn't bother me, however, was the performance of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri.  Covering decades, Abraham brings a totally different vibe to both the old and younger versions of Salieri, and both work extremely well.  It's also worth noting that his character isn't all that likable on paper, but he brings the grounded humanity, especially in his jealousy for Mozart, that's missing from the rest of the film.\n\nAnother thing Amadeus has going for it is the glorious music used and conducted for the film.  Surely, most of the tunes are genius-ly written by the original composers, but the overall sound quality and editing is brilliant.  Putting character dialogue aside, merely listening to this film is a joy.\n\nI may be in the minority here, but to me, a film must do more than just sound great, it has to move me emotionally in one way or another.  The made up story has its fascinating moments, but it gets old after a while.  As does the over-the-top performance from Hulce.  Sure, a wonderful soundtrack and Abraham's performance are impressive, but it's not enough to get this to a positive review for me.\n\n+Abraham\n\n+Music\n\n-Hulce\n\n-Characters lack humanity\n\n-A tad long\n\n5.8/10",

But I feel the character Salieri so deep in my bones it's frightening.  Envy, jealousy, desperation to become what one simply is not, beheld by the genius that is Mozart.  And how the film is made to speak to a conventional audience, not mired in cliche accents or period dialogue; it speaks to us today.  I am not a lover of period dramas, though most anyone knows my deepest regards for Barry Lyndon.  This is just as incredible an experience.  There's this grand piece Salieri puts together with lots of characters, a real epic, and the followup reaction of Mozart, who condescendingly admires the work.  But we don't even need to hear Mozart say this, because hearing the flatness behind the grandiosity of the work intercut with the serious passion of Salieri and Mozart's conniving mockery watching from above tells us the whole story.  We get this sense of embarassment that one would feel going to a Michael Bay explosion fest - I got nothing, so make it bigger.  Salieri's music is not bad at all, it's good, but simple and acting like other pieces.  Mozart's are trying to break free of the mold, applying contexts relevant to his circumstances; it empowers the meaning of his music while offering a justification for Salieri's humiliation and envy.  Salieri is more powerful politically, but not half the genius.  And it's worsened by the feeling that Salieri had to fight his family to become what he wanted, praying for his father's death, while Mozart built it in his blood, growing up with it and being nurtured by his family.  Salieri realizes Mozart was destined for legacy, and he couldn't stand not feeling part of it. What a fabulous historical fiction.",

Murray Abraham) recalls the life, times and his troubled relationship with a prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \n(Tom Hulce) he couldn't compete with and resorted to destroy him. Mozart's passion and pure genius is identified by his father Leopold (Roy Dotrice) at a very young age and prepares him for greatness, but the tremendous expectations, his poor business and social skills leads to gambling and alcohol addiction also taking his supporting wife Constance (Elizabeth Berridge) down with him. \n\nThe best part about the movie is the point of view that of Salieri who alone saw Mozart's true potential and genius and was the most affected by him. The way Abraham explains to the priest about beauty of Mozart's music, how he was never able to compete and how a God fearing just man like him resorted to low politics and scheming is one of the best performances you could come across. While featuring medleys of Mozart's popular compositions, the background score stays competent enough to make a mark of its own. The screenplay is energetic pushing an incredible number of heartfelt moments perfectly justifying Salieri's actions at the same time making you feel for Mozart. \n\nJust like Mozart's music, this movie is a joy for everyone.",

            "content": "His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen.  Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. \n\tSo declared Antonio Salieri, \"Patron Saint of All Mediocrities,\" friend of Mozart and mutual enemy of God in the impassioned and penetrating Amadeus. Milos Forman's Amadeus film version of a Peter Shaffer play of the same name based on a novel take on a rumor originating from the life of Mozart shook the world and nabbed eight Oscars the following year, including Best Picture. After being reproduced in many forms, could it even portray Mozart as truthful and powerful as the man really was? Frankly, no. No retelling of this genius' life can ever surpass the depth and power of Mozart's original story and life, but Amadeus gets awfully close to it. After reading the stage play and the film's screenplay, I felt that this movie was simply the luckiest achievement in film ever. Unlike other great films, Amadeus is \"fragile\" in a sense, for, taking the words of Salieri out of context, \"Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.\" \nThe music, one of the best aspects of Amadeus (supplied entirely from Mozart's own compositions and performed by the prolific St. Martin in the Fields with conductor Sir Neville Marriner), creates a perfect dramatic effect while sampling a conception of Mozart's genius. Now, after viewing Forman's film, I visualize Mozart's music - the drama, the context, and the inspiration behind the music. Listening to Mozart's music now, each note and phrase triggers a memory of certain shots and emotions from the amazing insight Forman and Shaffer gave in Amadeus.\nRetelling his story to a priest, Salieri recounted his conceited boyish prayer with God: \"Lord, make me a great composer. Let me celebrate Your glory through music and be celebrated myself. Make me famous through the world, dear God. Make me immortal. After I die, let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote. In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life, Amen.\" Years later, Salieri, now an Austrian court composer in the service of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), saw with sense of betrayal God's creation of Mozart. He knew Mozart's music was great, and his own was not. This fact alone did not worry him; it was the fact that Mozart was a coarse and vulgar boy. Often, he had talked and prayed to a cross hanging on his wall, but once his contempt overflowed, he gave it one last prayer and gazed at it once last time - ablaze in his fireplace: \nBecause You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You! I swear it! I will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as I am able. I will ruin Your Incarnation.\"\nIronically, although Salieri named himself virtuous and worthy of being God's \"Incarnation,\" the vulgar Mozart held a closer relationship to God -- even having a certain fear and respect of Him, of which Salieri had none. But taking on the action he had sworn to do, he held Mozart in his deadly grasp, gradually sucking away his money, sanity, life, and finally, his music. \nWith a perfect balance of words, Shaffer crafted the infamous Salieri, whom F. Murray Abraham played with intensity, and surprised us with his remarkable transition between a bitter, yet free, elderly Salieri and a quiet and calculating, thickly accented younger Salieri. No one -- not even I -- would have thought the two Salieris were played by the same actor. Abraham speaks Shaffer's words with such resonance and a sense of illustriousness that they stand out in our minds, seeming as though his words alone had an impact on history. \nThough both the theatrical (PG) and director's cut (R) versions are inherently identical, the director's cut offers more material and, along with it, more content worries. Other than the content, Amadeus, if understood properly, provides emotionally depressing elements along with a disheartening emotional war between God and Salieri. Both versions contain usages of obscenity and scatological humor as well as overall vulgarity coming from Mozart. The director's cut, with twenty extra minutes, shows Mozart's loyal but worryingly dedicated wife attempting adultery in a struggle for money and also some nudity in Salieri's insane asylum. \nNever before or after Amadeus had a movie effectively portray an iconic classical music figure without ruining the drama and comedy. Most of us view Mozart as an indomitable demigod-like music figure -- even if we know as a fact that Mozart was crude, barmy and ill-mannered -- but we could never comprehend that Mozart was an actual living vulgarity. Indifferently, Forman and Shaffer tore to shreds the demi-god character of Mozart and gave room for him to shine his crudity. Many have complained about the historical inaccuracies of Amadeus, especially the ending scene where Salieri takes a dictation from Mozart for his Requiem. However, as Shaffer explained in the introduction of his stage play, he changed the ending for dramatic effects. Amadeus is not a biopic; it is a historical-fiction exploring the realms of humanity, hatred and God. \nForman and Shaffer left many varied and clear-cut messages in Amadeus. Some say Salieri's downfall was caused by either his jealousy or the haughty demand in his childhood prayer, explaining why God attempted to destroy Salieri - both great points and interpretations. But I believe that the explanation of God's wrath on Salieri is more objective. In his childhood prayer, he prayed for talent, and \"In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life...\" But as none of those qualities were evident in the film, he earned that punishment. But wasn't Salieri's request for a righteous man to have the musical talent an honorable request? Perhaps. And perhaps God did fulfill that request, just through a different, yet pious and talented, Austrian: Franz Joseph Haydn.",

So when I watched it for the first time in Music Appreciation, it actually was one of the best movies that I've seen. So years later, I watched it again, and Amadeus still holds up and doesn't feel dated. F. Murray Abraham is really great in this, and Tom Hulce as Mozart is one of the best parts of the film. I don't know anything about Mozart except that he's a famous musician, but if there's a person that I think to be Mozart, it's Tom Hulce. The hair-stylish is rally great and it does make the place feel like Vienna. The soundtrack by Sir Neville Marriner is one of the best scores that I've seen. The soundtrack is exuberant, interesting, it gives a sense of adrenaline, and I'm glad that the film uses Mozart and Salieri music instead of composer's own music. Peter Shaffer did a fantastic job of translating a play into a movie and it never felt like there's a moment that felt off or missing. The costumes they wear are really good and definitely make the time setting feel like the 1700s. Even though that the film is 160 minutes long, it was very inter string from beginning to end. The direction by Milos Forman is really good and really made the film a special one.",

A much more sinister and intriguing film than it's arthouse rep may suggest, Amadeus' unsimulated musical numbers and intricately beautiful recreation of Mozart's operas add an immense thematic gravitas, while the use of natural light and haunting score add an ominous atmosphere that is effortlessly and relentlessly heightened until the elegiac coda.",

            "content": "One night a couple of months ago I found myself watching the television with my girlfriend at midnight with the intention of falling asleep but then by the fortunate stroke of luck of me changing the channel to BBC 1 I stumbled across a film about the musical jousting between two composers, Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and my word was it a best flick of the button I ever made; especially to a channel with no adverts! Long before we knew it, 2 and half hours passed and my girlfriend was for once still watching with me and I knew I had witnessed an unexpectedly remarkable tale. Amadeus is one of those rare pleasures cinema can offer you if ever end up watching it. This event only ever happened to me another time in mirroring circumstances. It was One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u00e2??s Nest instead, and guess what the other similarity was\u00e2?\u00a6 both were directed by Milo\u00c5\u00a1 Forman! This truly does evoke the gem of a hidden director he is.\n \nFirstly, Antonio Salieri is our main character even if the distinguished Mozart is involved. We see him as a middle aged and elderly man staying on screen for the duration of the film. He believes divinity made him pursue music and will guide him to his own personal glory. However, considering in today\u00e2??s society he is not that known compared to the popular composer that is Mozart, you can literally expect Mozart to pop up and ruin Salieri\u00e2??s personal plans. It is the same God in Salieri\u00e2??s eyes that makes Mozart better than he is thus developing his spiritual vendetta with the divine. F. Murray Abraham portrays Salieri\u00e2??s inner battle with himself and Mozart outstandingly considering he has to make us notice him amongst such a celebrated figure. It is no wonder we tend to enjoy his performance despite his selfish and envious state of mind.\n \nSecondly, Wolfgang Mozart is our supporting figure whose spendthrift, heavy drinking ways and the demands of composing add to the exhaustions and pressures of his life creating a really overexcited and outrageous genius that you would not have expected to be this way. In our eyes, he remains a genius due to his musical prowess; however, his persona is not that pleasant. His vivacious character and bothersome high-pitched laugh is quite repellent but his exuberance gives off the same effect his music does; which does sound pretty delightful. Tom Hulce portrayed Mozart in such a frenzied manner it blew us all away and quite literally himself; he has hardly had a film role in the last 30 years! Mozart\u00e2??s genius is that he can ridicule himself and mind-blow the audience at the same time especially when he memorises in one hearing and cruelly destroys Salieri\u00e2??s piece of symphony with a masterful new and improved piece of music. This difference in Mozart is what makes him the greatest conception there has ever been of him on screen.\n \nThe relationship between our protagonists is competitive and deceitful. Underneath we can see Salieri\u00e2??s hate and envy of Mozart\u00e2??s power and his annoyance that someone so ridiculous as Mozart, has been chosen by God. Despite their conflictions, Salieri is unable to force Mozart to finish his Requiem on his deathbed, thus leaving Salieri incapable of seizing his only chance at glory. Both are flawed; one suffers from his incapability to attain his own goals and the other an unfulfilled genius whose hedonistic lifestyle prevented him from becoming someone more fabled in history.\n \nThe films poster effectively portrays what the film entails; it is a story of power and the cloaked figure with his arms outstretched demonstrates an orchestrator of songs and supremacy. The film is supreme in itself as it bagged the Best Picture gong at the Oscars in 1984. It was perhaps the best film of the 80s in general, however, today many will not notice it because there are no films today being made of this manner and magnitude therefore it passes on overlooked.\n \nThat is the film\u00e2??s overall flaw for the time being, it is not a genre of film that attracts many. Its complexity in dialogue and sets and the fact that it is a period drama forces many to be daunted by the prospect of it. Amadeus consciously concludes with Mozart\u00e2??s hysterical trademark laugh leaving you experiencing something memorable and unique therefore forcing you to remember the masterpiece crafted by Forman.\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nReversing the daunting genre that is period drama into an unexpected hit, Amadeus plays upon two fiery figures in history and ones battle to be as good a composer as the other. Considering the better composer is Mozart, it is one heck of a battle the other faces.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        9/10",

If that's not enough, it mocks pretension by using Antonio Salieri. He's just so insufferably envious of Mozart, that he inadvertently kills him. Even after death, he can't get over how inferior he is to the master. What a great antihero. A jerk to end all jerks. Adding to the ridicule that makes Amadeus so unique, is Mozart himself. Without prior knowledge, you'd leave the film thinking that this whole time, he was an idiot savant. But perhaps, Mozart is just as colorful as his punk rock wigs... at least that would be what we all would hope for. While I don't think it's Milos Forman's best film, it's a magnificent achievement, and for the grand majority of it's 3 hours, it's engrossing.",

            "content": "An Ode to Mozart's Music\nTo borrow a notion of Mozart's style from respected classical musicologist Charles Rosen, Milos Foreman's motion picture of the Peter Shaffer play is full of the \"violence and sensuality\" characteristic of Mozart's music. In addition, by Foreman brilliantly documenting an appreciation of the \"supreme expressions of suffering and terror\" of the main characters in this story, we receive a philosophy of life that is \"shockingly voluptuous\". This movie is a mirror of human despair and delight. As Mozart's music does, so too does Foreman's ode to this exceptional musician achieve a harmony we wish could more often flow through our lives. At the same time, he delivers our compliment exuberantly fresh. This film could even turn a staunch hater of classical music or commonly glum nihilist into its most fervent recruiter.\nHaving cut his throat in an attempted suicide, aging former Viennese court composer Salieri (F Murray Abraham) is sent off to an insane asylum while crying out to God and the world that he is guilty of murdering composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). While recovering at the asylum, a benign and sympathetic parish priest comes to take Salieri's confession. Following his usual rhetoric, the priest says, \"All men are equal in God's eyes\" which raises the learned composer's eyebrow and sparks the story of how Salieri came to know Mozart, why he thinks all men are not equal in God's eyes, and why Salieri believes it was he who ought to be blamed for the great composer's death. After telling us about his rise from a provincial Italian town to court composer for Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffery Jones), we learn about his adoration for his young contemporary. When the opportunity arises for Salieri to meet his idol, he discovers he is aghast at Mozart's complexity-how can a \"giggling, dirty minded creature\" compose works that are so sublime one may believe they could hear the voice of God? Split between adoration and rancor, Salieri confesses to the patient priest of his plot to learn of Mozart's secrets, of throwing every obstacle in his way, of hoping to find the opportunity to steal Mozart's last piece of music and claim it for his own-all at the cost of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\nWhat truly makes this film a masterpiece is the point of view playwright and screenwriter Peter Shaffer decided on to portray Mozart-through the character of Salieri. Salieri is more like most of us than the gifted Mozart. Regular people generally believe that faith in our family, our institutions, even in our religious convictions will yield some level of greatness in our chosen field because everyone applauds our efforts. However, when we come across someone truly singular, we suddenly find ourselves covered by a dark feeling that our very purpose in life has been cast into shadow and doubt. Surviving this knock at our ego, we retaliate with envy. Naturally, we try to oppress this envy; Salieri does not. And we love him (and Abraham's portrayal) for it. Salieri plays puppet master to Mozart's pain and suffering, using every event in the great composer's life in Vienna to test his genius. For instance, after spying on Mozart's family at a masquerade, Salieri sees that Wolfgang's father wore a completely black costume. Later, while still grieving from his father's death, Salieri dons the same costume, visits Wolfgang one still evening, to commission a \"Mass for the Dead\". Now almost bankrupt, needing to feed his wife and child, he accepts this request. Like Salieri, who seems to ignore his conscience, we observe Mozart's suffering without pity. We know what Salieri is doing is unethical yet by the very nature of cinema, we cannot interfere with the relationships between these all-too-true characters. As with many great films, the motivations of villain and hero are harmoniously clear and \"Amadeus\" sits among this tradition.\nBe warned. This is a work of fiction, loosely based on Mozart's life. The film does not document a realistic relationship between Mozart and Salieri; it does, however, illustrate the spirit of longing to be better than oneself. Salieri may not have actually been before Mozart's deathbed to transcribe the voice of God (i.e. the most perfect music), but we are all glad to experience the possibility if it could have happened. In real life, Salieri and Mozart were close enough to have even composed together a cantata for voice and piano called \"Per la ricuperata salute di Ophelia. So, if anyone wondered if Salieri actually had the opportunity to co-create with Mozart, the answer is yes. However, Shaffer's \"what if\" scenario is much more fantastic, engaging, and rewarding.\nSuitable for anytime you or your family needs to have their spirits raised...and for creative types, \"Amadeus\" will help let flow one's creative juices. If anyone ever wanted to watch a movie that delivered all it promised, this is the one.",

            "content": "Amadeus is a period film that interprets the character of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his rival composer Salieri, the cour composer to Emperor Joseph II. The film was shot mostly in Prague, a city with such a quaint and mysterious quality about it that it almost seems unreal. Prague is the stand in for 18th century Vienna where the film is set, and it is an interesting choice because Mozart was always more appreciated in Prague than in Vienna, so much so that he chose the Teatro di Praga (now known as Estates)  for the Premiere of his two part opera 'Don Giovanni'. The cities' wonderful palaces and castles are featured throughout the film, and the Estates theater is used to stage the reenactments of Mozart's operas. There could hardly be a more fitting place to film.\n\nThe film is often darkly amusing, and the story is told in a very compelling way. Salieri reflects on his past, particularly as it relates to Mozart. He narrates the story of how he became a successful composer in Vienna and his eventual acquaintance with the young composer from Salzburg. His relationship with Mozart deteriorates more and more as the story unfolds until he comes to completely despise him. Salieri's one request to God as a child was that He \"make me a great composer\". In return he devotes himself to God and to virtue. Mozart's incomparable talen makes evident that God had not chosen him for this purpose after all. In many ways Mozart is his oppossite. He is impious, irreverent, and arrogant, and he shows little respect for Salieri as a composer. But Saleri sees in Mozart the talent he desires and he resents Mozart for this. He cannot come to accept that God would endow such a \"perverted, obscene little man\" with a gift of musical talent to be cherished by many generations while his music fades into obscurity. Consumed by jealousy, Salieri secretly attempts to ruin Mozart, often using his influence to suppress Mozart's music, even though he secretely admires the music, recognizing its greatness when others fail to perceive it. \n\nThe film is incredibly well acted, especially F. Murray Abraham's preformance, and the direction and screenplay ties in with the music in a seamless way. It amazes me how perfect everything about this film is, from the acting, to the set design, to the use of the music, and of course, the outstanding sceenplay. Everything came together for director Milos Forman on this one. I think Amadeus is one of the best dramas ever to be captured on film. Certainly there are other contenders for the crown of greatest drama, but I think Amadeus is at least one obvious choice.",

The film managed to win lots of awards including eight Academy Awards including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\"Amadeus\" tells a fictionalized story about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The film starts with an elder Salieri attempting suicide while screaming for forgiveness for killing Mozart years prior causing him to be placed in an asylum where he is visited by a young priest wanting to confess him. The priest manages to convince Salieri to tell the story of his rivalry with Mozart and why he claims to be responsible about Mozart\u00b4s death. \nPeriod films are always a tricky genre, while the majority is boring or just forgettable, every now and then we get an exception that's engaging and memorable, like\" Braveheart\", \"Gladiator\" or \"Barry Lyndon\" to name some examples, and fortunately \"Amadeus\" manages to be part of that list of great period films.  Having already proved to be much more than an effective director with \"One Flew over the Cuckoo\u00b4s Nest\", Czech director Milo Forman managed to create a beautiful film that despite the fact is three hours long, is close to perfection with his stylish directing focus on the little details that enhances the experience \"Amadeus\" offers. The acting here is just mesmerizing with the best being F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce giving phenomenal performances that both deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor, beautiful cinematography, a excellently made eighteen century atmosphere, convincing and beautiful costume design, perfect art direction, ambitious themes that are greatly executed, being a film about the greatest composer of all time I expected that Forman would use actual Mozart\u00b4s work and thankfully he did and it works so perfectly and while the story is far from being historically accurate, it still is a well told, fascinating and entertaining drama with a little of actually funny comedy at the beginning of the film.\n \"Amadeus\" is a powerful and beautiful masterpiece that's close to perfection despite its long runtime; it deserved its 1985 nominations for the Academy Awards. This is one of the three movies that made me a lover of the seventh art, in my preteen years. If you enjoy dramas, this is a must see film.",

It tells the story of Mozart's professional life through the lens of court composer Antonio Salieri, a man tormented by his own relative mediocrity. It opens with an elderly Salieri in some kind institution for the mentally ill, claiming he killed Mozart and unburdening himself to a priest. Through that relationship, with the priest claiming to offer God's forgiveness, Salieri confesses his awe, jealousy and manipulation of the young genius, ultimately playing a key role in driving him to an early, overworked death. \nIt's majestic, moving and utterly beautiful. It's a study of guilt - who doesn't reach Salieri's age without secrets they need absolution from? It's a study in the corrosive powers of success - the film's Mozart is perhaps most akin to a modern day elite sportsman, feted with praise and money he doesn't have the maturity to handle. It's a study in marriage under pressure - Constanze, Mozart's wife, is brilliantly played by Elizabeth Berridge; devoted to her husband, but one partner always just out of reach of the other. \n\nMost of all, it's a study in creativity and what we who benefit from the creativity want the creators to be like. Mozart should be as sublimely beautiful, dignified and upright as his creations. Instead, as this film and Tom Hulce's performance renders him, he's an obnoxious brat with an annoying laugh, no discipline and no self-control. It's that laugh that divides viewers; it's that laugh that Salieri hears even before he first lays eyes on the man he discovers to be Mozart. How can this man create such beauty? Thereby hangs the crux of the film, and Salirei's existantial torment. It drives deals he strikes with himself and with God; it defies belief and offends the ears as much the music entrances them. It reaches its height in a spellbinding, unforgettable scene where Salieiri helps a bed-ridden Mozart work on his Requiem (a piece commissioned by a shadowy figure Mozart doesn't realise to be Salieri himself). Mozart hears the music in his head and dictates it to Salieri, who even then can barely keep up. Even with his nemesis at death's door, he can't hope to match him.\n\nBased in truth as it is (though how true it actually is, I don't know), the film achieves a kind of truth much more true than mere facts, uncovering the deeper realities of limited humanity's quest for transcendence. That's why, for instance, the American accents the actors keep throughout the film don't bother me one jot. The film is so true that the accents are frankly irrelevant; I'm not distracted by them, which I most certainly would have been by bad European accent imitations. \n\nIt's a film which teaches me about beauty, hope, work, creativity and the freedom to take all my prayers - not just the safe, nice ones - to God and leave theme there. In my life as I live it, it's unmatched, unique and irreplaceable. I can't imagine my life without it; and I don't own a single note of Mozart's music.",

Along the way the Mozart is ingeniously portrayed as a clumsy goofball with the most annoying laugh but underneath the comical exterior, we see a true genius who writes music to absolute perfection in the first and only drafts. His complex relationship with his father is another layer to his character's complexity. The film also uniquely blurs the lines between diagetic and non-diagetic music in a way that adds to the story. \"Amadeus\" is a brilliant, funny, dramatic, and provocative picture that could not be more perfect.",

            "content": "I gush I admit it I am a gusher and I'm going to be gushing more than a little here. So a little history first, Amadeus was a 1979 play written by Peter Shaffer inspired by a short play titled Mozart and Salieri which supposedly had roots in another play; this film is a self-adaptation Shaffer's version as he wrote it (how hard was that I wonder; screen and stage require different writing talents) and was directed by Milos Forman. The film is a period drama/historical fiction about the legendary Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with the twist being that it is told from the point of view of Antonio Salieri. This is why I find this title most interesting... it is not I repeat is not a biopic but a historical fiction. The tale being told while not all ROAR HOLLYWOOD LIES is intentionally taking heavy artistic licensing to tell a fictional tale about real life people. Now let me take a moment to explain myself.... I admire and respect the genre as much as the next guy but I don't much care for biopic films, they are generally speaking excellent works and very valuable in Hollywood but I am too much of a genre geek. I am not against biopics but my preference is speculative fiction and that's why a film like Amadeus satisfies me in ways that The King's Speech cannot. See the story is how the royal court composer in Vienna, Antonio Salieri, portrayed by F. Murray Abraham (F.Y.I. this role won him an Oscar) goes mad with jealousy against the inspirational but vulgar Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, and is driven to murder.... While being two composers in the same town means they were inevitably rivals, Salieri never tried to murder him and they were reported to be very respectful but I don't know if they were ever friends by definition at least. This movie owns up to its historical inaccuracy and while that may peeve elitists, the filmmakers are free to tell the high concept passion project that history inspired them to do rather than to give visual reference to the life of men who've been dead for years. And to make this as transparently clear of what I mean when I said this film \"satisfies me\" let me tell you... I heard of this film and was interested so I looked up the original theatrical trailer on YouTube which opened with these words: \"Are we going to appall you with something confidential and disgusting? Let's hope so, because that is what you really like - unconfessed crimes of buried wickedness. If that is what brings you to us, the prospect of hearing horrors, you shall not go unrewarded\". (copy and pasted from here:[ http://www.teenink.com/reviews/movie_reviews/article/206235/Amadeus/]) .... I could not ask for a better 1st impression! I was HOOKED! It was like the film addressed me personally, almost telepathically; it knew who I was, what I liked, and what it was to get me to like it. I love trailers and this one is among my favorites ever. How could I refuse a siren call from a work that was so clearly made with me in mind? To say that it met those overly high expectations would be an insulting understatement; this! Film! Had! EVERYTHING! High concept premise with a biblical scope; passion for the arts; balances adult artistic class with juvenile MTV sleaze; has a universal tone juggling comedy and drama; it is full ham and cheese yet full of subtly and serenity; it has music so powerful that it's downright audacious; it is a spiritual story of two well-rounded, magnetic personalities, both in their own ways fighting inner demons that corrupt them over the course of the film; it is a beautiful looking film with outstanding sets, and costumes, bring to life a culture of a time long ago; this movie has everything I love in and is a perfect visual model for my personal taste; if people asked me \"hey Schmude how is it you plan to make movies\" I'd say watch this, it'll give you a good idea; this movie... ooooooooh thiiiiiiiiiiis moooooooooovieeeeeeee.... I admit this isn't really much of a professional review but if that's what you want I ain't the man you want to go to. I really can't say anything that hasn't been said better by someone else. In fact this isn't a movie I want review so much as I want to study, analyze, and just admire for its craftsmanship. But until then this is the best I got....",
