    "summary": "New York Times reporter Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) is on assignment covering the Cambodian Civil War, with the help of local interpreter Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor) and American photojournalist Al Rockoff (John Malkovich). When the U.S. Army pulls out amid escalating violence, Schanberg makes exit arrangements for Pran and his family.

            "content": "It's hard to imagine that what should have been a great film could be reduced to merely passable based on a bad music score, but such might be the case with The Killing Fields.  The movie, about friendship, loyalty and the horror of war, centers around the relationship between New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and his aide Dith Pran (Haing Ngor) as they try to bring international attention to Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia and the covert American intrusion into the country at the tail end of the war in Vietnam.  Filled with countless powerful images and an enduring message, much of the impact is sabotaged by Mike Oldfield's horribly distracting score, consisting primarily of a shrill and wince-inducing synthesizer that sucks the emotion out of countless powerful scenes.  While it's still worth watching, it might be more impactful with the sound turned down and the subtitles turned on.  Just a suggestion.",

The press characters were all unlikeable, the story telling was very muddled, the pacing could have been better, and the ending was predictable. However, the cinematography, visual effects, and soundtrack were decent. Furthermore, the depictions of chaos, the disregard for human life, and the lifestyle of a slave were well done.

The relationship between Waterston's Schanberg and Ngor's Pran feels too undeveloped to carry the emotional weight necessary to carry the film throughout their separation. The protagonists don't really exhibit much in the way of tangible flaws, leading the film to feel almost too sanitized of a depiction. Regardless, the Killing Fields remains a powerful condemnation of the Cambodian genocide at many points, often as a result of Pran's quiet tenacity in the face of exceptional cruelty. he embassy scene, in which the assembled photojournalists scramble to forge a passport for their ally, is exceptionally well done and features the tension that would have served the film well if it were allowed to be more pervasive.

            "content": "Male friendship is an odd thing as in films the bond often slips into homoeroticism as in the case of Becket (1964) and Once Upon a Time in America (1984) but this film avoids heading into that territory and instead chooses to portray the emotional, heartfelt connection that two men experienced. First time feature film director Roland Joffe brings an observant but slowly paced style of filmmaking to the subject which allows for development of characters and a sense of great loss as the tragedy stretches on and on. While I found the film to be a tad over long, you really do feel the length, I was captivated by the story and I did come away feeling that I had learned a great deal about the horrific effects that resulted from the Khmer Rouge winning the Cambodian Civil War.\n\nAmerican journalist Sydney Schanberg, Sam Waterston, covers the political upheaval in Cambodia in the mid-1970s for the New York Times and is aided by his dutiful assistant Dith Pran, Haing S. Ngor, who makes sacrifices to get his employer access. The two form a particularly strong bond over the following years as Schanberg and fellow foreign journalists Al Rockoff, John Malkovich, and Jon Swain, Julian Sands, are threatened by the new Khmer Rouge regime. The country soon falls into disarray as the military are disorganized and amoral and when the journalists are apprehended Pran is forced to beg for their lives. The journalists become extremely devoted to him after he takes this action and when he faces imprisonment they try their hardest to forge a British passport by creating a new photograph to place within it. Sadly, Pran is taken in by the police and forced into working on a camp where he is brainwashed under the ideals of the new government while a guilty Schanberg returns to the United States and desperately tries to locate Pran. \n\nThe film doesn't necessarily follow the traditional structure of a film of this sort as while you could argue that we see a rise, a fall and a rise again we progress through this traditional structure with more focus on the characters than their achievements. The majority of the first hour of the film is simply meeting the characters and seeing Schanberg try to cover the dangerous political situation while Pran displays his devotion. It is only after Pran saves these men that a plot really begins to emerge as we see the armies truly impact the lives of these men and build up the relationship between the two protagonists. From there the two are separated and we see Pran tortured while his best friend worries over him back in New York City. To me this was the less interesting section of the film as the drama seemed more forced and the film was lacking without the friendly rapport between Pran and the journalists. Obviously this section was necessary as we needed to see the extent of the suffering that people faced under this regime and feel overjoyed when poor Pran finally made his way out but it stretched on for a long time and at some point the misery of it all was drowned out by how repetitious it felt.\n\nFortunately before the rather slow second half there is one surprisingly thrilling sequence in which Malkovich and Sands try their hardest to take a photo of Pran and have it inserted in his fake passport. A certain camaraderie and boyish excitement is present in these sequences that is not seen in the rest of the film and I must say I was holding my breath as these photographs developed and then faded into nothing. The tragedy at the end of this rush to save Pran only serves to make these scenes more poignant as all that effort goes to waste and Pran will be unfairly tortured but at least he knows he has won the love and respect of the men he has worked with. Malkovich also shows off the fiery intensity that would make him an icon and which worked to such great effect in Places in the Heart (1984). \n\nThis is definitely deserving of a look but not on the level of fellow Best Picture nominees A Passage to India (1984) and Amadeus (1984).",

S. bombing of Cambodia, subsequent departure of international forces, and then the bloody rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, which resulted in genocide.  As expected, it is horrific.  But focusing on the central friendship allows the filmmakers to treat the terrible events as a sort of backdrop, letting viewers digest their awfulness while keeping their attention on the more specific concerns of Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Pran (Haing S. Ngor), such as how to get Pran a forged passport.  Of course, the film could also be charged with the typical crime of giving American viewers a white protagonist to identify with rather than simply telling the story of the Cambodians -- but, conversely, Pran does dominate the film\u00e2(TM)s second half (in a work camp) and really becomes the film\u00e2(TM)s emotional center (and Ngor rightly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar).  The film doesn\u00e2(TM)t really pull any punches either \u00e2\" there are brutal unjust killings throughout, plus the usual aftermath of war (injured and dead children, dead bodies piled up or cast aside), even as the cinematography can also be quite beautiful (showing sunsets of Thailand, where the film was shot).  The tension remains high for most of the picture and you never quite know who will survive.  Waterston, John Malkovich (playing an acerbic photog), Spalding Gray (who later developed his monologue Swimming to Cambodia about making this film) and Craig T. Nelson are some of the familiar faces who went on to further success after this film.  Cambodia itself took a lot longer to recover from the events portrayed here...which stand as a warning to the world and its leaders.  Powerful.",

The pair were caught up in the chaos of Phnom Penh as the Americans and then French pulled out of the city and Pran was forced to stay behind and try as best he could to survive the madness of the revolution. There's a real sense of the panic and trauma the population of the country underwent. This is perhaps most vividly shown on the screen as the Khmer soldiers enter the city and force the civilians to evacuate. The movie doesn't flinch from showing some of the atrocities Cambodia endured at the hands of both the US with their bombings and the Khmer militants. The casual shootings and beatings, sometimes by family members, the way in which people were suffocated by having plastic bags put over their heads and the mass graves in which bodies are dumped are all portrayed but in a manner that feels shocking and moving rather than gratuitous. This was an awful and shameful piece of human history which the movie captures well. Sam Waterston, John Malkovich and Julian Sands play the chief Western characters but the movie is held together by Dr. Haing S. Ngor, himself a survivor of the genocide, who really holds the movie together. His portrayal of Sith Pran is extraordinary and he rightly won an Oscar for his role in this magnificent film from director Roland Joff\u00e9. An unusual score by Mike Oldfield adds perfectly to the sense of confusion and terror during the evacuation of Phnom Penh and takes on a more measured and sympathetic tone during the quieter scenes. The Killing Fields stands as a demonstration of how the human spirit and friendship can at times overcome terrible adversity and despite the harrowing nature of the subject matter, this is ultimately an uplifting story.",

They are there in 1973 when Cambodia is a side-theatre of the Vietnam conflict.  At this time the Khmer Rouge are on the rise but not a major threat.  Then we jump forward to 1975 and the Khmer Rouge have the upper hand and are about to take control of the country.  The US, and other countries, are evacuating personnel.  Though both of them have an opportunity to leave too, Schanberg and Dith Pran decide to stay to cover what happens next.  This will ultimately put Dith Pran's life in grave danger as the Khmer Rouge's reign over Cambodia was one of oppression and genocide.\n\nInteresting, though a bit dry.  The movie starts very slowly and takes a very long time to find a second gear.  Even when things do start to fall into place and you get to understand where the story is going, things still don't really move at more than a moderate pace.  \n\nHowever, the last 40 minutes or so more than make up for this.

More oppressive than the film's politically motivated self-seriousness is its white liberal guilt. In telling the story of Pol Pot's regime through the eyes of an American reporter, director Roland Jaffe has fashioned a narrative that is as dishonest as it is cursory. The factors driving the Khmer Rouge takeover are entirely grazed over, and the images of warfare and desolation feel like photos in a TIME magazine--exotic suffering as filtered through a Western lens. The over-indulgent score is a symphony of  synthesized cacophony which tells the audience how to feel (unsuccessfully) instead of letting them feel for themselves. At once fragmented and overly manipulative, The Killing Fields tells the story of Pol Pot's totalitarian regime as you would read about it in the New York Times while sipping a cup of coffee.",

The journalists seem to be there only as journalists. They seem indifferent to everything besides getting a perfect picture. They act so carefree it gives you the idea that nothing bad will happen to them, and nothing does happen to them. Instead the movie brilliantly follows Dith. It isn't about Americans in a war torn country, it's about the people who live there. Dith is such a polite and helpful guy it's really heartbreaking to see what he goes through. In most survival movies the struggles get to you because you imagine yourself in the survivors situation, but in The Killing Fields you care for the character because you see him as a real person and not just someone to identify with. It isn't an easy movie to sit through, but it's a very rewarding experience. The movie succeeds because it draws on your compassion and not just your instincts of self-preservation.",

The soundtrack is very mixed and utilized to its full potential, with some powerful orchestral scores and at times some eerie futuristic scores. The film also does something very unconventional, which is to change from Scanberg to Pran's point of view halfway through the film, but it works out perfectly and it's the second half about Pran that is the better part of the film. The latter half is very thin on dialog and gives Cambodian doctor Haing S Ngor a chance to shine which he does and his performance is so spectacular that it won him an Oscar for his first role ever, as Dith Pran.

Ngor), who reported of Cambodia events in 1975. The first part of the film follows largely reporter Sydney Schanberg and how he relentlessly pushed the boundaries of journalism to keep the world aware of the rapidly deteriorating situation in Cambodia. The second part of the film focuses on Dith Pran and the events that took place after the country's capital, Phnom Penh, was overrun by Khmer Rouce troops. While Sydney got evacuated with the rest of westerns when the capital was occupied, Dith Pran as a native Cambodian was forced to stay and survive the merciless reign of Khmer Rouge. \n\nWhile the film's story is based on real events and tells about important subject, it failed to captivate me. This was largely due to the slow and rather uninspiring first part of the film with main focus on Sydney Schanberg. The film's interesting rate picks up greatly on the second part when the focus is turned towards Dith Pran and his amazing escape to freedom from one of the Khmer Rouge's forced labor camps. However it was bit too little and too late to restore my total complete interest with the film . \n\nSo in the end The Killing Fields is a about important subject, but as a movie it turned out to be rather heavy to digest and at times I felt more like watching a documentary than a film. Even so, what the film lacks in entertainment department, it certainly compensates with good acting by all actors involved and by shedding light on a largely neglected historical event, the Cambodian Genocide.",

It doesn't have one or two as the main figure and the rest just as extras who may or may not die. It makes every person important, because in the situations the story charters into, every figure is in fact important. It's a tricky wire that The Killing Fields walks on because it's such a powerful story which needs proper telling, and luckily Roland Joffe achieves that just fine. His role as a director is excellent, and he makes The Killing Fields out to be a memorable story which is told with finesse.\nHis application of the atmosphere is exemplary in its strength because the convincing production design and naturally flowing cinematography sets the mood for The Killing Fields organically for the brutality that follows in the story, and it all just comes together so naturally that the viewer is thoroughly convinced of the realism in the drama. It's very powerful and hard hitting drama, and is extremely convincing. The lighting also assists in setting the mood for situations\nThe musical score is horrific, by which I mean its so beneficial to the intensity that it makes he drama of The Killing Fields mirror that of a horror film, as it's powerfully strong and haunting at the same time. It's successful all round and thoroughly intense when it needs to be.\nAnd the cast of The Killing Fields constantly keep the character drama of the story important and give a round of strong performances.\nSam Waterson is strong as Sidney Schanberg, and I wish he got more screen time to make a longer lasting effect with his presence. Nevertheless he did a powerful and determined job and made a fine lead role.\nJohn Malkovich's performance is mood-setting because his physicality and performance is a reminder of the character portrayed by Dennis Hopper in the war classic Apocalypse Now!, who was also a photographer and had a similar appearance.\nAnd Haing S Ngor is interesting to watch, because he's so involved in capturing the essence of Dith Pran's character drama that he does nothing short of becoming the character. Haing S Ngor isn't an actor, he is a victim of the actual events in Cambodia and created a goal of showing people what the horrific starvation of the Cambodian people is like. He ended up having to do it as an actor, but it is no lesser in its strength this way and is just impeccably powerful. His ability to capture emotional drama and leave an impact on the viewer is a strong achievement.\n\nThe Killing Fields is utterly a brutal and unforgettable experience that taught me more about Cambodia than 13 years of schooling did.",

Roland Joffe and Craig Nelson provide such professionalism and artistic integrity to a film of major political proportions. From a political point of view, this film is undeniably important for audiences to witness a side to violence that is not always exposed so easily. In terms of filmmaking, \"The Killing Fields\" represents pure art in every sense of the word. It's a total masterpiece. \n\nA journalist and his assistant attempt to document the horrors of the Cambodian Genocide during the Vietnam war, where violence has enveloped both nations. Throughout the course of there journey,  they are met with insurmountable odds, having to face tough decisions like risking there lives in order to successfully document what they are witnessing. The film's story is so perfect because its so distinctively real and vivacious. It's brutal honesty brings the audience closer and closer in. It's almost as if you are viewing a true eye-witness account. That's how good this movie is. \n\nThe performances are absolutely remarkable. Sam Waterston does an amazing job in this film, and he really makes you believe that you are taking a look at actual occurrences. His wonderful acting lights up the screen. He will really blow you away. The rest of the cast does a fantastic job as well, especially Haing Ngor, an actual Cambodian who went through these experiences. The performances and story unfold like a Newspaper special, documenting everything that happen in a reflective manner. \n\nThe film's visuals are the most Breathtaking aspect. To witness all of the horror and violence through the perspective that the filmmakers allow us to is truly remarkable. The movie is made in such a way that we are viewing what is occurring in a journalistic manner. \"The Killing Fields\" doesn't take any steps to dumb down its audience. It presents them with the brutal truth. Landscape shots of the Cambodian countryside are vivid and surreal. Every second of film is used to the directors' advantage. Everything has a purpose here. \n\n\"The Killing Fields\" not only serves as a remarkable achievement in film, but a strongly political important picture. Its a film that truly had guts, to present its audience with honest documentation of the horrors and atrocities that were committed in Cambodia during the 1970's. If it isn't, it should be on some list somewhere of the most politically important movies ever made. It exhibits a mark in human history, and in the history of film, of a time of political instability, social unrest, and unrelenting violence. A truly important film, and a truly wonderful film at that.",

An American journalist, Sydney Schanberg, and his Cambodian photographer/translator ,Dith Pran, are caught in the revolt and are eventually captured. The foreigners are sent out of the country but Dith Pran is taken prisoner. Roland Joffe was at first a seemingly important filmmaker. The Killing Fields was his first film and he followed it up with the equally powerful The Mission. Since then his career has been full of mediocre and atrocious films... what a waste. Along with films like Salvador, Hotel Rwanda and The Last King Of Scotland this powerful true story feels as relevant now as it was when it was made. Its the film that doesn't let us forget the atrocities which fell upon Cambodia and it's people. The performances are incredible. I never like watching Sam Waterson on screen but he is solid this time. The film's powerhouse performance, however, belongs to Haing S Ngor as Dith Pran. Having never acted previously he himself was a survivor of the Khmer Rouge and he considered the film to be his own way of bringing the story to the world. He won the Oscar for best supporting actor but I reckon his role deserved the award for lead actor. He has more screen time and a deeper humanity to his performance. The support acts are great too including John Malcovich, Julian Sands and Spalding Gray (and what the hell is Graham Kennedy doing in this?)... At the close of the film John Lennon's imagine is played over the final moments. When the song begins it seems a little tacky but as the power of Lennon's lyrics and optimism are sung, it highlights the power of the song and the astonishingly disbelieving realism of what man is capable of. I hadn't seen The Killing Fields for years but I'm glad I revisited. A great film.",

            "content": "Since when did they let British people make movies about the Vietnam War? Man, a year before this film alone, they were iffy about Oliver Stone, an red-blooded American veteran from the war, making \"Platoon\"; but hey, in all fairness, the guy is so crazy and offensive that you could sense it before he even really got his career moving. Maybe the Brits fooled everyone with that poster, because with this film's name and that old West-lookin' poster, you'd think that this is the most tobacco-spittin'-ist, gun-shootin'-ist Western that we've ever seen, and I know that sounds like yet more American territory, but really, if they'd let the Spanish and the Italians be icons of the Western film genre, I think that we could at least cut the Brits some slack. Of course, we're not talkin' Westerns; we're talkin' about 'Nam, and everyone knows that it's only the Americans' job to go to war with most every major Asian nation. It's no place for the Brits, unless they're planning on having a war with the Vietnamese to see who is more obnoxious, and even then, it would be kind of underwhelming, seeing as the Brits would lose by lunch, because the Vietnamese had to have been the most obnoxious people on Earth in the '60s. Yeah, I know that's very offensive, but really, although a lot of them weren't that bad back then and certainly aren't that bad now, let's see you come back and be totally tolerant after they've thrown you're buddies on fecal matter-covered spikes, sent children out with grenades and robbed you, all while yelling at you in the most obnoxious jibber-jabber... you bunch of Brits. Still, I must admit that although you weren't really there, y'all know how to still make some pretty decent Vietnam war films, though not quite good enough to drown out the missteps that tragically triumph over potential yet again.\r\n\r\nWith this being a British Vietnam War drama from the mid-80s, it should almost go without saying that this thing is dry and even kind of dull, dragging along very quietly with a loose grip on both editing and tension. This of course damages the film's compellingness, which was already tainted from the get-go by offering very little immediate development, and as the film continues, it fails to make up for that immediate lapse in development by providing very little exposition. The two aspects of slowness and a lack of exposition, when combined with the kind of repetition that plagues this film, form a dreadful mix that often means one thing: Nothing. Well, sure enough, for long periods in the film, absolutely nothing happens, and when something does happen, it's so messily tacked on the shaky line that is this film's storytelling. This concept of portraying the horrors of the Vietnam War through the eyes of the innocents caught in the middle, as well as the journalists that went to find something unthinkable brutal, only to find far more than they ever could have expected, is wildly inventive and potentially stellar, but in execution, the unique concept is done an injustice by a tone that's both dry and unrefreshing. However, for every misstep this film makes in executing its ambitious concept, it will pull a right move. It may not always be a smooth film, but it is one that will make you think, because although the film is not as provocative as it could have - nay - \"should\" have been, you'll still walk away with plenty to chew on.\r\n\r\nAs much as I joke about how everyone is portraying the enemies of the Vietnam War as wildly obnoxious and evil, there were plenty of victims on both sides, and even between the battlefields, and when this film removes the reigns and tells it like it is, things get pretty hardcore. Whether it be a shot to the face, cries of fear, dismemberment, children taking shrapnel or all-around pandemonium, Roland Joff\u00e9 doesn't shy away, but neither does he focus so deeply on the brutality to where it's manipulative. The film is harsh, violent and ultimately effective, which isn't to say that Joff\u00e9 only nails the brutality of the situation, because there will be points where the fine score, lovely cinematography and sharp editing all supplement Joff\u00e9's tender, thoughtful atmosphere and create sharp emotional resonance that may not be in the film enough, but really wake you up, if not just plain break your heart. Joff\u00e9 may be the very man that keeps this film from being truly powerful, but when he delivers, he knocks you cold, being matched in resonant skill only by his performers, all of whom are excellent, with leads Sam Waterston and Haing S. Ngor standing out the most. In the beginning of the film, Waterston's Sydney Schanberg character is a charismatic, professional one, but as he walks through the most horrifying sights that no man should see, defeat and anguish falls upon him little by little, a fact emphasized particularly well during a scene in which he's looking through unspeakably horrible footage and listening the operatic music in the midst of it all, and with all of the jaw-dropping, real gore and sweeping music, the thing that catches your eye the most in that sequence is Schanberg's cold, broken and lifeless face, racked with anguish in one of the many definitive testaments to both the Sydney Schanberg character and Sam Waterson's acting abilities that you can find throughout the film. The same, if not greater amount of praise goes out to Haing Ngor, who's portrayal of a clever and skilled, yet still very civilian and honorable man caught in the most dangerous of situations is believable, emotional and haunting. These two men, and others, go through the most senseless, godless of horrors, and while the flaws in the final product keep it from being a truly impacting portrait on war, the performances are among the most key aspects that make this film as effective as it ultimately is.\r\n\r\nWhen the horrors die down, there's still much to be desired in the execution of this should-be distinctively brilliant, very unique concept, as it is plagued by limited exposition, as well as some repetition and storytelling that's both unrefreshing and often fairly dull, yet the film will often make up for some its mistakes with glowing moments carried by an assured and appropritately disturbing, when not deeply emotional atmosphere set by both the imperfect Roland Joff\u00e9's and his consistently stellar cast, headed by the hauntingly powerful Sam Waterston and Haing S. Ngor, both of whom play two of the biggest parts in making \"The Killing Fields\" a generally compelling and ultimately provocative portrait on the brutality of war through the eyes of the mere observers caught in the middle.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

This film is an extraordinary account (well, most historical films are) of a tumultuous time in the globe, but it's greatly flawed in the process.\n\nBased on the perspective of a group of journalists, they all go to Cambodia, when it just so happens that the Khmer Rouge is fighting to take over the nation. After the army assumes control, the journalists try all they can to stay together and find a way home. However, one, Dith Pran, couldn't make it and must endure the horrors of  \"Year Zero\" that was initiated back in Cambodia.\n\nA variety of factors makes this well worth watching. The story is nicely done, with accurate information about the Cambodian genocide. Sure, it doesn't have all the details, but movie has the important stuff. Speaking of accuracy, this is a close depiction to what it's like being a journalist stuck in a war zone. Feels very real, thanks in large part to mostly unknown actors, and they do a great job. The fact that one of them, Haing S. Ngor, was actually a survivor of the genocide makes it more effective and authentic. It has an epic and sweeping arc on its agenda, and the cinematography, scenery, and direction support it. There's some very harrowing moments, especially in the last half. One of them is when Pran takes a plunge into what gives the film its title. The brutal and honest emotions make it not just a war film, or a genocide drama, but also a tale of friendship, trust, and betrayal, which really proves poignant in the end.\n\nThese 'killing fields' seem to rub off the wrong way somewhat. The soundtrack: I admire Mike Oldfield, since his album \"Tubular Bells\" is great. However, his approach to scoring an epic historical war drama about some pretty serious horrors is haphazard at best. Yeah, seriously, some parts of it are bad. At one point, it sounds like a circus funhouse gone totally wrong. But it did have its potential... \"Imagine\", while a good song, seemed kinda out of place here mostly because it felt a little too optimistic about 'never again'. Also, that film moved very slowly, as if it were crawling for the entire 2 1/2 hours; a few parts put me on the verge of rest, notably the ending.\n\nOverall, this film is gripping, tough, yet thoughtful material, filled with much ambition, which works only to a certain degree. It's a darkly satisfying treat for history buffs and others interested in this area of topic.",

Ngor's award-winning performance as Dith Pran. Ngor himself was a Khmer Rouge victim, and reading a Readers' Digest condensed feature written by him, detailing his harrowing experiences during Cambodia's grim years, I realized that it would have been a pity had he NOT portrayed Pran in this. Sam Waterston, John Malkovich, and Julian Sands, among the others in its cast, were superb and brilliantly evocative. This great odyssey of the human spirit kind of reminded me of Doctor Zhivago, but of course with one difference - unlike Doctor Zhivago, The Killing Fields had no hinted or explicit scenes of romantic melodrama. What it showed throughout its entirety was pure cinematic enigma, exposing the horrors and brutality of war and communism to a wholly convincing level. It really was an enjoyable film, and I think that all those opposed to war in general should watch it.",

Due to a language barrier, while reporting in Cambodia, Schanberg requires a translator and hence his Cambodian friend Dith Pran accompanies him. During the US Army's evacuation of all Cambodian citizens, Schanberg pressurizes Dith to stay back and continue sending him news flashes and help him with the news coverage. Due to this, he is left alone in Saigon while his family is evacuated by helicopter. Dith is then captured by the Khemer Rouge and is unable to be traced by anyone, despite efforts from Sydney. While accepting his Pulitzer Prize on behalf of Dith, Sydney Schanberg promises to somehow have Dith rescued from Cambodia. The film goes on to show the constant efforts of Schanberg and Dith Pran's own efforts until he finally succeeds to escape amidst tragedy of the death of his friend and a young boy whom he was asked to look after. The film was an extremely well made one that brought out the truth of this reality very effectively.\n\tFor a film to manage to bring out emotion and sympathy from the audiences while simultaneously being historically accurate is always a challenge. However, I felt that this film managed to do this extremely well. The development of characters, which is so crucial in a story such as this one was done beautifully as audiences were allowed to build a personal connection with them. Based on reality, the film portrays the horrific incidences that took place in Cambodia and for audiences, viewing this was truly a moving experience. Though the acting could have been slightly better, the fact that Dith's character played by Haing Ngor had actually been in Cambodia at the time greatly added value to the film. For me personally, the scenes of absolute silence amidst tragedy were most powerful as they had so much emotion behind them. Honestly, I would highly recommend this film for everyone.\n\tAs an Emerson student, I find that this historical tragedy is extremely significant. Today, we live in a world that is becoming increasingly smaller. Being a communications school, Emerson students must understand this importance and significance of being able to communicate with people from across the world. Had Schanberg been able to do this, maybe the story would not have been as tragic as it turned out to be. Besides this, it is heartening to see the dedication and passion that the two had towards media and journalism. As aspiring professionals of the media world, we students must draw inspiration from such characters.",

We follow the paths of these two journalists and their very different struggles during this horrific time in history.\r\n\r\nThe Killing Fields is a heartfelt drama about  the relationship between two journalists, which almost seems romantic. The love that these men have for each other is a bond strengthened by a common passion and goal to show the world what is really happening in Cambodia, despite all of the politically influenced  mass media in the United States telling the public that nothing is wrong. The acting from Haing Ngor is absolutely phenomenal; being somebody who actually went through  it\r\nduring the time period, he gives us such a genuine performance and establishes some serious credibility  within the film. He brings a certain emotional reality that is necessary with trying to recreate such a gruesome event in history. The film's score was beautifully done as well, providing a solid backbone to the severity and raw emotion expressed within each scene. It elevated  the tension so perfectly at times like when they are in the dark room making the fake passport at the French\r\nEmbassy or when Pran stumbles across all the corpses in his escape. The score gives off that raw \"real-life\" feel that is so important in its emotional appeal. The cinematography couldn't fit this style any better. Its persistant use of tracking shots forces us to follow the characters along in their efforts to document and uncover the reality of the situation in Cambodia. We move where they move. The one thing I disliked that took away from the realness of the film was some of the fake blood splatter; it looked like a cartoon and was very unconvincing in relation to the rest of the film. Despite this one minor blemish it's a beautifully crafted film that stirs emotion (I teared up at the end of this one) and uncovers the truth about the Cambodian Genocide.",

When trying to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives, they are arrested and later learn that the press had reported a different version of the story. In 1975, people were being evacuated from the capital because of a possible invasion from the Khmer Rouge. Even though Pran's family is able to flee, he decided to stay and help Schanberg cover the story.

Sydney teamed up with Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for New York Times. When Sydney arrived to Cambodia the US army have bombed Neak Leung by mistake, Sydney and Pran bribe a policeman to sneak them in the boat because all routes were closed. After arriving to the town and taking photographs Khmer Rouge followers arrested them. Before Sydney Schanberg and Pran were released, the US army arrived with the international press unit to report a less harmful version of the story. Two years later Khmer Rouge was approaching the capital and all international embassies where evacuating. Sydney managed to get a secure evacuation order for Pran and his family. Although, his family was evacuated Pran refused to leave and insisted on covering the story with Sydney. The war accelerated for Khmer side and he was almost in total control. Meanwhile, all non-Cambodian citizens were in the French embassy awaiting their evacuation. Unfortunately, Pran lost his passport when he was at his family\u00e2(TM)s evacuation, Sydney and other reports tried hard to make a fake passport for Pran, but it was an unsuccessful attempt. He was forced to leave the embassy, and Sydney left Cambodia. Several years later Sydney won a journalism award for his converge. He also searched countless times for Pran, but Pran was forced to labor under Khmer Rouge. After a while he escaped and was captured by a different prison compound leader named Phat. Short time after Phat was attacked and killed by Khmer comrades, Pran discovered that Phat son had dollars and a map showing a safe route to a Red Cross camp. Pran escaped with Phat son and for other worker, but when he arrived to the camp all of Pran followers were died. As soon as Sydney knew the location of Pran he travelled there and took him back to the states to join him again with his family.\nThe movie was interesting and inspiring in my perspective. I think the movie was well produced and sent out a clear massage about both journalism career, and the war in Cambodia. I think that the sequence of the story was well made.\nThis historical tragedy is important to students at Emerson College because one of the main majors of this College is communication, which the movie talks about.

Other than that, I had the chills when Pran was planning on escaping the killing fields; the terror of this regime is graphically conveyed to the viewer, it shows the brutality of the regime and, despite it all, how friendship and compassion can grow so much during hard times.",

It is the story of the resilience and intelligence of Dith Pran and many Cambodians like him, it is the story of the deep and abiding friendship between Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg, and it is the story of the efforts of the journalist duo to report the horrific happenings of the Cambodian conflict and the war crimes of the Khmer Rouge. \u00e2The Killing Fields\u00e2? is well acted, in particular by Haing Ngor who portrayed Dith Pran. Ngor brought great depth and likeability to his character which must have been derived from his personal experiences at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. The film is definitely dramatized and at times the amount of blood and pyrotechnics detracts from the gripping realism and humanity of the story; the conversations between friends, the fear, the sudden and difficult good byes. While perhaps over the top and lacking in brevity, \u00e2The Killing Fields\u00e2? is emotionally and politically charged and succeeds in gripping its audience.",

            "content": "The Killing Fields is adaptation of the 1975 Cambodian War regarding the dreaded Khmer Rouge. It is told from the point of view of Sydney Schanberg, a New York Times journalist, and his local representative, Dith Pran. Throughout the film, the two men begin to cover and photograph the tragedy this war has brought to its people. When Pran's family is given the opportunity to flee to America, Schanberg convinces Pran to stay and help him finish his in-depth story. Eventually, Sydney heads back for America, leaving Pran behind to face the Khmer Rouge on his own. Back in the US, Schanberg win an award for his story, while Pran continue to battle for his freedom and independence back at the slavery camps. Towards the end of the film, Sydney returns with Pran's family at an attempt to save his friend. The final shot shows the two men reuniting, safe and sound in a Red Cross camp near Thailand. \n\tWhile the movie itself was very well made, filled with haunting and emotional scenes, it was not something I would recommend to someone with a queasy stomach.  It was very difficult for me to watch the descriptive scenes, including that of Pran witnessing the killing fields, filled with bones and blue bags used for the suffocation of the war's innocent. The film was basically a two hour brutal torture and it is not something I will likely watch through a second time. However, the true story is beautifully told, and the acting itself is very powerful. \n\tThis historical tragedy should be an important story that every Emerson student should take into account. The Killing Fields shows the importance of communication and how important it is to report the truth to the people. The movie also gives the impression that one should never give up, and fight for their rights and their dreams. Despite the gory graphics, this film should make Emerson students proud of what they have accomplished in their lives and never give up on what they want in life.",

The two men work very closely to report the tragedy occurring in Cambodia, and Schanberg later wins a journalism award for their work. Determined to report the truth, Schanberg and Pran stop at nothing in order to cover the violence in Cambodia that takes place between the Khmer Rouge (the communist party) and the government troops. After Pran sends the rest of his family to the United States with the evacuating American troops, he remains in Cambodia to help Schanberg. The Khmer Rouge arrests Pran and Schanberg, along with some of their colleagues. Being an American citizen, Schanberg is able to retreat back to the United States, but Pran is forced into working in the fields under the watchful eyes of the Khmer Rouge. Pran must partake in the re-education process, in which he needs to pretend he is not an intellectual and acts as though he does not know French or English in order to survive.  Pran eventually escapes, and he partakes in an emotional reunion with Schanberg. \r\n\tThis film combines an emotional story with very powerful images. The desolation of Cambodia during that time period is expertly captured and portrayed in a way that connects the audience to the characters in the film. The scene that shows Pran walking through the field of decaying bodies is especially haunting.",

            "content": "The Cambodian genocide that took place during the rule of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970\u00e2??s is considered to be one of the worst genocides in modern world history. The film, The Killing Fields, takes its name of those who have died due to disease, starvation, and violence upon innocent civilians from the restrictive policies of the Khmer Rouge, numbering from 1.8 to 2.3 million, in which the land of Cambodia became their corpses. The Killing Fields is an important and eye-opening portrayal of a significant period of world history in Asia. The film is based on the true stories of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, and Cambodian journalist, Dith Pran. Both undergo the events of the genocide themselves throughout this historic film.\n\nThe director of this movie does not hold back in showing the events leading to the genocide, which started in 1973 with an accidental bombing of a town by American planes that killed hundreds. Along towards the end of the film, Sydney is in New York, trying to find any sign of Pran\u00e2??s whereabouts, for he was recently enslaved in a forced labor camp under Khmer Rogue rule. If the film had focused entirely on presenting the historical events, the film would be too overwhelmingly depressing to view. It shouldn\u00e2??t be viewed as a historical drama but as a reminder that such atrocities exist and still happens in our world today. By simply ignoring them, those atrocities will never go away.\n\nDespite the horror of this inhumanity, this movie is not widely taught or discussed within schools in America. As an Emerson student, it is profoundly important to know of this historical tragedy because the characters in this event have risked their lives to use the art of media to communicate what is going on in the country of Cambodia. It was a duty to themselves that they were proud to accomplish. Many people aren\u00e2??t aware of such events in the world unless it is being passed on through the arts such as movies like this, or even through mass media such as newspapers, radio, TV news, etc. As a student, it is our duties to spread the word of what goes on in this world as a message because every little matter that happens to one community can have the powerful, domino affect to impact everyone else.",

For about an hour, Dr. Ngor was not only himself; he was Dith Pran, and he was any and every other innocent victim of communist oppression and enslavement and genocide.

The Khmer Rouge, the guerilla Cambodian army, were involved in a  civil war with the National Cambodian Army.  An evacuation is ordered for all American embassy inhabitants to leave the country, but Schanberg and Pran decide to stay to continue reporting what is going on.  Sometime after, when the Khmer Rouge take over the capital, the two journalists are arrested.  Pran is able to talk them out of the execution they had planned for the prisoners, but is then taken captive while his American friend goes free. \nPran is made to labor in at rice plantations and the Khmer Rouge try to brainwash him, and everyone else, into thinking their beliefs. He attempts to escape and in the process, is caught and thrown in prison again.  Meanwhile, Schanberg had been trying to find Pran to try and save him from the communist rule.  Then, he wins an award from his coverage of Cambodia, but feels guilty about it since, Pran had so much to do with the coverage and he still hadn't been located. \nWhen the prison where he is being held is attacked, Pran manages to escape and find a Red Cross station.  Schanberg is alerted of Pran's reappearance and goes get him from the safe house.\nThis movie was brilliantly made. It was intelligent, respectful toward actual events and very realistic. It brings up a great social point about censorship and journalism in times of war. Before Schanberg went out to Cambodia to write about it for \"The New York Times\" most people had no idea that any violence was occurring. And, what they did know was what the government chose to tell them. It only has to take a very small number of people to change the world by telling the truth and this film is a great representation of that point.\n\nE. Yumkas",

The film tells the story of American Journalist Sydney Schanberg and Cambodian journalist Dith Pran and their efforts to report the truth of the violence of the Khmer Rouge while fighting to stay alive.  As the violence persists, Pran is forced into imprisonment with the Khmer Rouge, while Schanberg is evacuated from the country.  Pran becomes a laborer for the Khmer Rouge, He struggles for survival and longs to escape the brutality of the totalitarian regime and be reunited with his family and Schanberg.  \n\tThe Killing Fields was a poignant film that grabbed my interest from the start.  This movie does not shy away from the uncomfortable.  It depicts ghastly scenes of violence that are both shocking and edifying.  The vivid images throughout the film portray chaos and desperation unlike any other war film I have seen.  My emotions were deeply affected by each scene and I was left with a greater understanding of this historical event.  \n\tAs a marketing student at Emerson College, it is important to note the way the press handled the portrayal of violence in the media throughout this film.  In the beginning of the movie, the press corps arrived with the U.S. Army to report a sanitized version of the story.  It showed that the mass media is highly censored and displays a manipulation of opinions.  It is also important to note the persistence of journalists.  As I study the mass media and forms of communication and begin to develop my own marketing strategies, knowing about this historical tragedy becomes relevant.",

Fairly intense at times, but most intense during the middle sequences of the film. Quite sad as well and very graphic.

I decided to revisit this film again, many years later.\n\nThe Killing Fields is an outstanding piece of film making that is serious in nature and tragic in scope. The performances by a young Sam Waterston (Law and Order) and Dr. Haing S Ngor hold the film together. Their chemistry is electric and its almost as if the two of them seamlessly became the characters they are portraying.\n\nThe cinematography is beautiful, despite the war torn environments and the bloodied victims. The sequence  that shows the evacuation of Saigon is intense and amazing.\n\nFinally, the musical score is something that is actually a character itself that I never noticed on prior viewings. Its a score that is very stirring.\n\nIf you haven't seen The Killing Fields, its an excellent movie that highlights a portion of history from the Vietnam War. A warning however, there are graphic images that may be disturbing to some viewers. This is a serious film with a serious story.\n\nHighly Recommended",

Thought to be benign, rebels overtake the government with the help of Americans, ignorant to their full power after the end of the Vietnam War. Not to say that these events were not important, but the film came across as more of a biography of Dith Pran, a captured Cambodian, then on the actual killing fields full of rotting corpses. For the next hour the tumultuous record of exposure to the dictatorship based on genocide is captured by Dith Pran, working the fields, trying to escape without being killed by small children, the hierarchy of the system. The ugly betrayal of humanity is alarming, not always documented by groups of people being slaughtered. It's etched across actor Haing S. Ngor's face as his mortality flashes before his eyes. My main qualm is the choice of music, which is either a reject 80's synth piece, or a racially insensitive set of bing bongs.

            "content": "A devastating, searing true life war story focusing on the war reporting of New York Times correspondent Sydney Schanberg, played by Sam Waterston in a superlative Oscar nominated performance, he won a Pulizer Prize for his coverage of the civil war in Cambodia before its capital, Phnom Phenh, fell to the Khmer Rouge in 1975. Stunningly photographed on location in Thailand, directed with great skill and intelligence by Roland Joffe, with powerful Oscar winning cinematography by Christopher Menges, who captures the  full horror of this Asian holocaust, in which about three million Cambodians perished, in a inhuman campaign of ethnic cleansing by the tyrant Pol  Pot.  Lacerating scenes include those involving Schanberg's desperate attempts to free his friend and Cambodian assistant, Dith Pran, played by the late Dr. Haing S. Nigor, who in real life was a survivor of this human tragedy, he delivers a heartfelt and unforgettable Oscar winning performance, he is left behind in the chaos, and must survive the living nightmare of the Khmer Rouge's \"re-education camp.' a contemporary version of hell on earth. The film also features exceptional supporting performances by John Malkovich, Julian Sands, Craig T. Nelson, Athol Fugard, Spalding Gary and Bill Paterson. A poignant and intensely moving film, which is one of the most powerful haunting motion pictures ever made on the subject of the Vietnam War. Winner of 3 Academy Awards, Best Supporting Actor: Dr. Haing S. Ngor, Best Cinematography: Christopher Menges, Best Film Editing: Jim Clark. Note:  On Feburuary 25, 1996 Dr. Haing S. Nor was found murdered in the garage of his apartment building, shot to death at the age of 55, in Los Angeles, it is very sad and ironic that a man who endured and survived 4 years of imprisonment, torture and starvation during the Khmer Rogue atrocities in his homeland, and struggled to be free, should die so brutally. His relatives and friends believe that his killing was revenge for his opposition of the Khmer Rogue.  Highly Recommend.",

            "content": "In mid 1975, a man named Saloth Sar took power in a small southeast Asian country that was completely neutral in the war between the United States of America and Communist North Vietnam. he then promised peace and prosperity for all of his people. everyone would be totally equal. he then proceeded to kill of everyone with even half a brain in his country. some estimates of the amount of people that he killed, range as high as 2.2 million in a country full of 7 million people. Saloth Sar is better known by the name of Pol Pot. The country that he took over as leader of the Khmer Rouge (Khmer Rouge meaning Red Khmer with Khmer being the major ethnic group of the country he took over) was Cambodia and this is a movie about the Killing Fields. Oh and by the way, if you do not know who Pol Pt was, look it up NOW. watch this movie NOW. forgive me if I get a tad preachy here, but this is not the sort of event in history that we can afford to forget.\r\n\r\nYes I know, this film didn't win Best Picture so this is a little bit of a deviation from my latest review pattern. although I feel that this film fully deserved to win Best Picture over the sub par period drama about two rival composers, Amadeus. \r\n\r\nI was raised my whole life (this is my dad's second favorite movie after The Godfather) being led to believe that this film was extremely brutal. well, in a way that hurt me because I had this level of brutality on the level of Saving Private Ryan and it wasn't that brutal at all. this is not to say that it wasn't brutal. it totally was. what the KR did to gain power is extremely horrifying. this movie truly captures just how horrible it all was. If you were a doctor. you were killed. if you were a lawyer. dead. non Khmer Rouge politician. really dead. student. dead. spoke a language other than Cambodian. dead. journalist. dead. if the Khmer Rouge were bored and needed something to do. dead. you get the idea. The result was that after Pol Pot was no longer in power, there were no smart people left in Cambodia. \r\n\r\nnow for the film itself. the acting was really good. I liked John Malcovitch and Sam Waterston a lot. but, the highlight of the film was the Oscar winning performance by the late Haing S. Ngor. he was absolutely amazing. He played Dith Pran, a Cambodian Journalist helping out the main character. he had easily the best performance of the whole movie. the whole movie was overall the best movie of 1984. its brutality and the power behind what the film was about made it an excellent film. Replacement winner for the actual 1984 Best Picture winner, Amadeus.",

Pran is forced to fend for himself and fight to survive within the totalitarian systematic slaughter which the Khmer Rouge inflicted upon their own citizens. Dr. Haing S. Ngor certainly deserved his Oscar for his moving and dramatic acting, and given the fact he was untrained makes it all the more remarkable.

            "content": "Roland Joffe's vietnam feature is sadly long forgotten amongst most reviewers. Not even 20,000 people have given it a rating on IMDB, and it's hard to see why. The director expertly spins us a new tale in the fiery war, where we see the reporters outlooks and experiences in a very dangerous war zone. Split in two parts, The Killing Fields looks at the bond and promises people make, and the pure compassion here is outstanding which is completely down to Waterston's and Ngor's vivid and believable performances. Joffe's realism is what makes this film so vivid, but the short running time restrains this epic from being perfect.The title 'The Killing Fields' relates to a number of sites in Cambodia where masses of people were murdered purely because they refused to be changed by the totalitarian communist khmer rouge regime and be 're-educated'. It looks very closely at 'year Zero' a time where cambodian history was to be erased and a new order took over to supposedly rewrite the mistakes their ancestors made. Part one of the feature observes the build up and danger that surrounds journalism in a war zone. Syndney Schanberg willfully presents his guide Dith Pang with an ultimatum. As the american troops have left the area, communism spreads and as everyone is evacuated he asks Pang if he would stay on with him. What ensues is a nerve-shredding suspense filled drama, with the two fleeing to a french embassy, but as Pang doesn't have a passport to stay on the ground, he is forced to leave and stay at a re-education camp, while Schanberg goes back to America to dwell on his mistakes. The second half deals with these horrific camps themselves, but Joffe never presents us enough detail to really shock us and show the full extent of such an awful war!Based on a fascinating true story, The Killing Fields capitalises on believability and truth with some very vivid characters. Sydney Schanberg is a great example of a journalist. But his compassion for his story would be nothing without guide/reporter friend Dith. Joffe's characters are lifelike, they are truthful and they stick firmly in a documentary style fashion which adds to the films respect and portrayl of Vietnam life. The film won the best supporting actor award for Haing Ngor's role as the struggling surivior of the Cambodian camps, as he tries to escape. It's a brave honest film that doesn't shy away from the state the american troops left the country in after they left.It is hard to believe that Joffe is the same director responsible for that wreck of a horror film 'Captivity'. His debut direction here is smart and broad allowing all the details to soak through. Building and depicting the towns, camps and life of these mainly peaceful people, and then shattering it all, with bleak desolate re-education camps, as well as showing the desperation and peril these people were in. He uses brief shocking violence at times to show how the relationship between life and death is much different in such a horrible war. Exceptional, though it is his fault the film is too short.The Killing Fields, loses the hollywood, big budget style that glossed over the cracks in films like Apocalypse Now, and The Deer Hunter. It is less theatrical and more realistic. It is a simple tale and look at Vietnam but Joffe manages to pull enough off, keeping some of the more mundane and less entertaining elements relevant and interesting. This combination of fact and fiction results in a diverse thoroughly harrowing account of a despicable time in history that shows a good unbiased balance of war. Ok the John Lennon 'Imagine' soundtrack at the end does grate with some people, but I felt it was a fitting way to end one of the most compassionate films ever made. Full of raw emotions The Killing Fields soundtrack emobodies the right sounds to facilitate the Vietnam feature, and it works for the most part.The Killing Fields [i]is [/i]far from perfect, but despite its flaws in length and in missed opportunities to be epic it remains a gut-wrenching oscar worthy drama that shows the war from completely different perspectives. Though it will never be everyones favourite war film, it may well be mine.\r\nFinal Score: 83/100",

            "content": "With the Khmer Rouge tribunals having started, this movie is an inside look at what many Cambodians went through under the Pol Pot's tyrannical power. The biggest misconception about this movie is that it's a war movie or that it's about an American journalist in Cambodia. No, it is a story about Dith Pran and how he survived while others around him died. Haing S. Ngor survived the Cambodian genocide only to be gunned down years later. His performance as Pran mirrors his own. Ngor does a lot of good acting, considering he was never an actor, but a doctor. I liked that this movie switches gears halfway and tells about Pran's struggles as he tries to escape Cambodia. It's horrible enough that Cambodians massacred Cambodians just for the fact they were too \"westernized,\" but worse that anybody could do this to another person. If violence makes you uncomfortable, don't see this. But what director Roland Joffe does is not show us some violence. We hear gunshots off screen. Maybe that's worse, because we see other people's reactions. Granted the whole scene at the end where Pran and Shneeberg are reunited at a Red Cross camp while John Lennon's \"Imagine\" is playing on the soundtrack is cheesy and the last line, \"There's nothing to forgive\" seems to be add for dramatic purpose. But the rest of the movie and the great acting by John Malkovich, Julian Sands and Sam Waterston makes it worth that little mulligan. This is one of the best movies of the 1980's if not one of the most important movies ever made.",

The scene in the bathroom that follows Schanberg's accepting the journalism award which hints that perhaps he used the plight of Dith Pran to aid his career was much needed and very brave to put in, it confirmed this movie as more than just about one Western journalist or his plight/ego.
