    "summary": "Former cinema superhero Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is mounting an ambitious Broadway production that he hopes will breathe new life into his stagnant career. It's risky, but he hopes that his creative gamble will prove that he's a real artist and not just a washed-up movie star. As opening night approaches, a castmate is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an actor (Edward Norton) who is guaranteed to shake things up. Meanwhile, Riggan must deal with his girlfriend, daughter and ex-wife.",

I think preciosity and arrogance put him among the best, as I saw some doing. Some open points in this plot lead more to confusion than to creative freedom for the viewer.\nThe camera effect popularized in the mainstream with Black Swan is noticed and gains space, making cinema a great theater. Although in this film the sequential rhythm is very fast, overlapping scenes and sometimes shortening the perception and assimilation time of the content.\nThe film makes use of surrealism to create a fantasy environment, which is immediately observed at the beginning with the main character floating. Perhaps this dreamlike universe could be better exploited, what we saw presented was a weak scene of the character flying to and fro.\nIt has some interesting dialogues, like the one from the newspaper critic.\nThe film tries to be cult but lacks depth. It's not a total waste of time but you'll end up with a little bit of that feeling. That's if you get to the end.",

Michael and Amy's work in bringing life to the most sweetest couple when everything was said and done was beautiful. Zach's enactment of manning the ship is excellent. Andrea's and Naomi's characters could be reflections of two different timelines of sane story. The essential sorrows of life preoccupied with on stage personas , clinging onto the tiniest of hopes. It's not just a kiss that's been shared but a longing to go back in time and a longing to step forward and feel what it brings. Birdman is a cleverly prepared collage of bits and pieces of all sorts of life stories, definitely worth a second watch.",

It's one of those films that doesn't fit into any one genre (or any two for that matter) and its wide array of interesting characters can't be easily summed up. But, that may be the reason why the film is so absorbing. It has so many original qualities that certainly don't fit into the standard mold of what a star-studded movie should be, instead putting a strange (but fascinating) spin on your typical drama. Set in the heart of New York City, it focuses on Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), a washed-up actor who gained fame for his role as the iconic superhero Birdman. Trying to overcome his ego 12 years later, he adapts and stars in his own Broadway play hoping to reclaim his spot as an important actor. We see the ups and downs of this production along with the odd way his psyche works, his inner voice being the Birdman character. There's also many other facets, including the quarrels between Keaton and Edward Norton's character (one of the main stars of the play), all equally entertaining. The writing is top-notch, serving up witty and funny moments throughout, and each member of the cast delivers a fantastic performance (my favorite being Norton). It also includes a brilliant musical score, entirely done with drums. And despite its flaws, mostly in a few goofy moments, it isn't one to miss.",

            "content": "Quondam superhero movie star, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), puts on his own adaptation of a Carver novel to prove his own self-worth as an actor. The film is filled with stereotypes \u2014 the semi-goth, attractive daughter with issues (Emma Stone), the talented, but annoyingly-method stage-actor (Edward Norton), the worrisome producer (Galifiniakis), the cold-hearted, miserable critic (Lindsay Duncan), et al. \u2014 but it never really takes a break or leaves you reaching for your phone. The lauded style is shot as if it was done in 1\u20132 takes (I've heard both), over several rehearsals, previews, and a premier of the aforementioned Carver-inspired play, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. What is Riggan's purpose? To part of him, he's high-art, the real deal, a stage actor on Broadway. To the other part of him, \"Birdman,\" the character he played in the 80s and 90s that launched him into superstardom, he's the opiate of the masses. \"Give them what they want,\" \"Birdman\" (Benjamin Kanes) says as he floats above Riggan's shoulder, speaking directly into his ear. Given the proliferation of Marvel, DC, Star Wars properties that are available at the click of a button, the film's meta narrative feels even more relevant in 2022 than it was in 2014. Dickinson (Duncan), the critic whose voice only will determine the success or failure of Riggan's play, gives a searing polemic on the former superstar's telos \u2014 \"Let's get one thing straight, you are a celebrity, you are no actor.\" (para) \u2014 and it kinda rules. The Macbeth scene with Bill Camp hanging from a ubiquitous NYC sidewalk beam is one of my most frequently YouTube'd scenes to watch \u2014 the others being the \"milkshake\" scene from There Will Be Blood and when God speaks in Silence. I could go on. I didn't take to the ending the first couple of times I saw this one, but I liked it more on this watch. I love this movie.",

This division is very much understandable, 'Birdman' has a great many merits but not everything will work for everybody.\n\nTo me 'Birdman' was an excellent film. Maybe not quite as good as the hype suggests, but nowhere near deserving of the many 1/10 votes when its merits are a great many that some people seem to have not acknowledged. Although, from personal opinion, a little over-hyped, 'Birdman' ('Gone Girl', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' and 'Whiplash' were also personal favourites, and 'Boyhood' was also better than given credit for considering the amount of hate it's garnered) was a 2014 highlight and a worthy Best Picture winner.\n\nNot everything in 'Birdman' works. Some of the pace is a touch frenetic in parts of the second half and not everything feels quite as tied up as ought with things left a little loose.\n\nHowever, 'Birdman' is an exceptionally well made film, with some of the best and cleverest cinematography of the year, some of the cinematography and editing is so dazzling it's enough to take the breath away. The special effects are also tremendous. Directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (in the first of his deserved director wins, the best being 2015's 'The Revenant), 'Birdman' is one of the best directed films of 2014 too and shows I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's immense talent as a director, with breath-taking vision, sense of mood and the ability to make the story as gripping as possible.\n\nThe script is fun, thought-provoking and at times touchingly profound. The story mostly, while sometimes thin, is gripping and the characters engage.\n\nMichael Keaton gives his best performance in years, an outstanding performance and perhaps a career-best. Edward Norton is similarly superb, his performance also ranking among his best. Emma Stones charms and delights too.\n\nOverall, very much divisive, with some people adoring or admiring it and others hating it, personally was one of the people who loved it while acknowledging its imperfections. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

There's no difference between a big blockbuster film and a theatrical play. They are both made by artists trying to make the best art they can. When I see a bad movie (let's not kid ourselves, there are bad ones), I think about the people who made it and I give them credit for actually finishing it, which is further than a lot of other people. I look back on the little short films I made a a kid with my friends and they are definitely not award-winners. But I made a piece of art that I was proud of. I bet the people that made \"Birdman\" can say they are proud of what they made.

            "content": "I happened to catch BIRDMAN just a bit ago, for those of you who don't know about it or even for those who just saw the trailer and were still a little confused, Birdman is an arthouse flick written and directed by one of the new heavies of Hollywood Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, of 21 Grams, Babble and Biutiful fame. The movie stars Michael Keaton as an aging actor living in the shadow of his past glories and his attempts to reignite his career with a Broadway play that he believes will help him prove to himself and the world that he's not just another flash in the pan Hollywood star.\n\nIt's kind of hard to know where to start with this movie because there is a lot going on in it and all of it is noteworthy. For starters, the story is really interesting as it seems to be written SPECIFICALLY for Michael Keaton about his experience since playing the famous caped crusader from Gotham City. The movie plays in a very arthouse cinema sort of way incorporating sharp dialog with surreal visual elements that keep your mind working to figure out how the show is going to play out. This experience is fueled by performances by Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts (all of which have been in comic book movies... Yes, even Naomi Watts, remember Tank Girl? You don't? Well I guess it's just the same because it wasn't very good anyway) as well as a startlingly good performance by Zach Galifinakis! It's really interesting following Keaton and the cast throughout this film and the semi-surreal nature of it really keeps you glued to your seat and wondering what is going to happen next. Will Keaton grow wings or will he buy a pack of gum? Who knows?! And that's really the appeal of this film. It's a kind of original film making that hasn't been seen on a big screen since the late 1970s which is really refreshing.\n\nI really enjoyed this movie and it is sure to garner a few golden statue nominations including Best Original Screenplay and maybe a Best Actor nomination for Keaton and honestly, it would be well deserved. If you do see this movie, here is a tip, don't let the trailer trick you into thinking it's a artsy superhero movie, IT TOTALLY ISN'T but don't let that dissuade you from going to check it out because It's in my top 10 this year.

I'm concerned that David Cross is not in the movie. It seems like some territory that would have been ripe for exploration by such a post-structuralist as Mr. Cross. I guess I am understanding why this was available for $4.99 on Amazon. Perhaps it felt more relevant in 2014. I wish that the guy from Fight Club was NOT in this film. (Yes, I wish it was David Cross instead.) It seems Hollywood has to come out with something like this every so often as an ironic commentary on the superficiality of Hollywood. It reminds me a bit of The Player in that regards but the Player is a more entertaining film to watch. Have we finally left irony in the rear view mirror? Yes, I don't understand what that even means. This movie feels too \u2018deep' and \u2018shallow' at the same time is what I'm getting at. The only real reason I've bothered with a review is so I would get a chance to continue my tradition of mentioning David Cross in all my reviews and this seems somehow relevant to such a \u2018self-reflective' movie.",

It is ironic how Michael Keaton and Edward Norton play themselves \u2014 actors, who have nearly lost everything in their movie careers. It seems right now, that after this movie they basically got a second breath, especially Michael Keaton, who plays the best. Michael Keaton's character is so well portrayed and is so relatable. If there was ever a time in your life when you felt envious towards a person, who you thought would never do better than you, or you thought that your career would be a constant plus, but instead it became falling down \u2014 the movie is for you. It's like \"Black Swan\" but with movie actors. It really makes you feel sad for the main character, you really believe him becoming crazy and schizophrenic and you understand how much the movie industry means to him. \"Birdman\" is all about dialogues and characters, as all of them are outstanding. The scenes in the play inside the movie nearly always express the mood of the characters. The reference to Robert Downey Jr in \"Iron Man\" in the beginning is amazing, as it sets the tone for this envy and grief the main character feels. Besides all that, it is an amazing and empathizing thriller, that sometimes gets psychological, which is why you will compassionate with every character, even Emma Stone, who in my opinion, should have had a bigger role in this movie. The ending is amazing, could be compared to \"Whiplash\" even to how good he is. I strongly recommend this movie to literally EVERYONE, not just specific genre lovers, an absolute masterpiece.",

It's a fast paced film with the amount of dialogue and the camera following characters and there is a lot going on. We see Keaton's character looking to become more than a blockbuster star and the voices of birdman still lingering inside. Will people take him seriously and how far will he go for real art. I loved the music. The jazz drumming sets the scene perfectly alongside the classical music. It's a stunning technical movie. Every shot perfectly staged and you can see how much care and attention has been put here. The scene when Keatons character is locked out of the theatre in just his pants is very memorable as are the scenes with Keaton and Norton. They play off each other so well. There is much going on from Keaton's relationship with his daughter and his girlfriend. We see the strain the play causes.

Where should I begin? The non stop flowing camera work, the metaphysical concept of Riggan, the metronome percussion orchestra, how about the theme of reality embodying fiction? In the heyday of his career, Riggan has exploited his fictional Hollywood comfort zone so much that it nearly cost him his job. As for Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), he heavily embroiders reality into fiction and has a continuing successful career, despite being less popular than Riggan. During the course of Birdman, Mike tries to help Riggan engage in reality by pulling the red curtain out of his eyes via his method acting techniques. Meanwhile, Samantha (Emma Stone) dwells in the neutral side, fulfilling her father's fantasy while also gazing at the current world. During which, Riggan's alter ego and voice in his head resembles his weakness and he tries to overcome it with his soon-to-be-successful play. To wrap up the analysis, A.G.

Earlier in the evening he had won statues for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.  The picture that garnered him all these awards was Birdman (or, The Unexpected Virtue of Innocence).\n\nThe movie stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, a Hollywood actor idolized for his portrayal of a superhero named Birdman in a trilogy of films.  Riggan is now seeking to prove something to himself, his fans, and the acting community by adapting, starring in, and producing a Broadway play.  The role is a pinnacle for Keaton and he is matched toe to toe by Edward Norton as onstage co-star Mike Shiner.  Both men were deservedly nominated for Oscar Acting nods.  Other notable performers include Emma Stone, Zac Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Amy Ryan.  If you enjoy top notch acting, the performances contained within the film's two hours will excite the heck out of you.  For me, there is something extremely special about watching an actor playing an actor acting\u2026 if it's done well.  And it is done superbly here.\n\nActing aside, the story itself is very much out there, told perhaps for the sole sake of art and expressing ideas.  From this vantage point the film won't be to everyone's taste.  The entire movie is filmed in single take where there are no cuts between scenes and the camera flows continually.  Most of the story occurs within the theater's stage and back-stage, so this style of filming is extremely tight and congested.  For me this was an apt metaphor for all that is swirling around in Riggan's mind.  From the opening scene through its unconventional conclusion, there is always a mystical wonder of what is really going on and what isn't.  The storytelling reminded me of when I have a frantic dream that I want out of, but it seems to continually rewind to a point of discomfort and play out again and again, just slightly differently each time.    \n\nHow far will one go for fame and adoration, and how much does one lose while seeking it?  That is the trade wind of this film, while underneath that it is tempered with gusts of laugh-out-loud hilarity.   The musical score is fantastic and the way the music is often used to break the fourth wall all on its own was spectacular.  Given its uniqueness I could certainly understand how the film might tailspin for some, but for me it flew high and magnificently!",

I finished watching this feeling inspired towards my own art, simply saying to anyone that would listen: \"Now that is a movie!\"\n\nEver since the phenomenon that is the Daredevil one-take hallway fight scene I've been fascinated by the art of the one-take. It demands a level of attention from the audience at all time whilst appearing natural, granting the audience presence. The camera work executed here by Emmanuel Lubezki made me feel as if I was constantly in the scene, alike found-footage movies such as Paranormal Activity; working alongside Riggan's questionable sanity and the overarching themes of the surreal, it makes you wonder who you are to these characters - if anyone at all. With a total of 28 well-hidden cuts, that means an average of over 4 minute cuts that flow seamlessly. Wow.\n\nI feel that this wouldn't work without the casting. Michael Keaton is the standout here, commanding space with his characters confidence, unstable emotion and stress. The moments where you see Riggan switch from the real world to the fantasy he is living in his own head are so powerful, and without his performance there would likely be half as many theories over what is real and what is fake within this movie. I feel as if the underrated performance was that of Lindsay Duncan, who bore significant threat in her scenes against huge characters played by Keaton and Norton.\n\nWith this being said, my favourite scene was between Edward Norton and Emma Stone when they are on the roof for the first time. Both actors displaying their wants so well through body language that I challenge you could remove all dialogue from the scene and still understand the interaction. Stone's boldness against Norton's restraint makes for an interesting scene with palpable tension. We are shown earlier that there is a large disparity between the two, thwarting any romantic relation, yet the chemistry is so strong that this idea is heavily questioned.\n\nIf I were to suggest an improvement, I would remove the sub-plots of Tabitha the critic or Jake the producer. They both pressure Riggan's play to have success, applying pressure in sometimes different, sometimes exactly the same ways. Instead, it would be nice to have more time with Sylvia the ex-wife; if Riggan was given more time with her character, he would likely form a stronger bond with his daughter based on symbolic meanings rather than any real connection. The important thing to remember is that in a film that is this well populated, it would be distasteful to just add another element.\n\nAs a story, this is well worth the watch. Expertly crafted with outstanding camera work, scoring, acting and focus on themes that truly take this movie to incredible heights.",

            "content": "Michael Keaton soars in this career best comeback film about, well, a washed-up actor struggling with his reputation and ego, desperate to touch the sun again. A modern-day Icarus re-framed in a showbiz satire. There're many levels to this new film by Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, and it is a far cry from his gloomier, more-grounded films like Babel and 21 Grams, of which both experiment with narrative structure, but nothing to the extent on display in this ambitious film.\n\nMuch has been made about its technically impressive cinematography that, apart from the very opening, feels like its shot in one continuous, breathless take. There's no doubt the film is a technical triumph and is another stunning showcase of cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, fresh from his Oscar win for the visually extraordinary Gravity. The camera weaves in and out of rooms, spinning away to follow Keaton as he struts comically down corridors before seamlessly breaking through the ceiling and taking flight among the rooftops of New York City. There is a particularly funny sequence that follows Keaton in his underwear and socks striding uncomfortably down the street as paparazzi flood him with camera flashes. In a film where one moment Keaton is levitating in his underpants and taking flight as a bird the next, it is his constipated expression here that truly shines.\n\nThe plot is about a washed-up actor struggling with ego and identity as he battles to mount a comeback performance for the opening night of his new play, which just so happens to be directed, written, and starring himself. This alone says something about the nature and dangers of ego, and the film goes on to explore this in its two-hour run-time that occasionally feels sluggish and meandering due to its constant stream of motion. While an impressive feeling of improvisation lingers in every scene, the film can't shake of its own self-importance, which even sees its own jazz-infused score shoe-horned into a dining room, with the drummer inexplicably playing there among the characters. However, it is all executed with artistry and confidence. There is no doubt the film will likely be considered pretentious, and to an extent it clearly is, but showmanship is exactly what the film is about, the fact that it achieves this with both its technical filmmaking and satirical story of fame is applaudable.",

Going into the film I was slightly worried because I am not a fan of director Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu's other films because they can often slip into pretension and unbelievable contrivances. The cast list looked great with the exception of the always terrible Emma Stone and I expected to see a fantastic Michael Keaton considering all of the praise he received. I was mostly satisfied as I felt the film made some interesting comments on the artistic process and featured beautiful cinematography but I hated Stone's performance and the score which completely didn't fit the tone of the film.\n\nRiggan Thomspon, Michael Keaton, is a washed-up actor most famous for his role as the superhero Birdman in a series of early-1990s films. He is attempting to revitalize his career by adapting, directing and starring in an adaption of Raymond Carver's \u00e2~What We Talk About When We Talk About Love' on the stage. New drama is introduced to his life when tempestuous method actor Mike Shiner, Edward Norton, is brought on to act in the play and begins a relationship with Thompson's distant junkie daughter Sam, Emma Stone, and questions Thompson's artistic process. As he loses his grip on reality he begins to have delusions of Birdman encouraging him to take up his mantle as a superhero again and take down his enemies, namely theatre critic Tabitha, Lindsay Duncan, as he makes increasingly irrational decisions.\n\nEmmanuel Lubezki won his second of three Academy Awards for Best Cinematography for his work on this film and he is deserving as the film uses innovative techniques to appear as though the entire film is one long shot. Thinking about how difficult it must have been to give this appearance allows you to appreciate even more how much effort was put into the film. The film is never beautiful like Gravity (2013) or The Tree of Life (2011) but the drama and emotion in certain scenes is captured perfectly as the lens is focused on the theatrical expressions of each character and the wildness of Thompson's delusions.\n\nThe performances that I most enjoyed were those of Andrea Riseborough, as Thompson's girlfriend, and Naomi Watts, as the play's lead actress and Shiner's ex-girlfriend. They managed to make the theatrical, stagey style of acting employed by all in this film work and feel natural in a way that it doesn't coming out of Keaton and Norton. Watts' performance had obvious echoes of Betty/Diane from Mulholland Drive (2001), a significantly better and more interesting film, but she still feels fresh and exciting as the touch of melancholy she brings to the role is fitting. Riseborough is believable as the shallow and needy girlfriend whose intentions are often unclear and she brings some of the best acting moments out of Keaton when she talks about wanting to be a mother. Stone is awful as always as the film is near unwatchable when she appears on screen, all of the affectation and fakeness that she is unable to cut out of her performances comes to the forefront.\n\nEasily the worst part of the film was the musical score as Lubezki chose to include the music of Antonio Sanchez whose compositions would fit better in a Martin Scorsese movie than this dark comedy. I was frustrated each time the drums kicked in giving a whimsical touch to scenes that were meant to be serious and emotionally moving, it managed to ruin parts of the film for me and that's unfortunate.\n\nThis would not have been my choice for Best Picture but it's definitely one of the more interesting winners of the 2010s especially when considering the wins of The Artist (2011) and The King's Speech (2010). My Best Picture of 2014 would have been Boyhood (2014) because although I have significant issues with it I still think it's an incredible achievement with some moments that feel so true to life that you can't help but be emotionally moved. I never felt moved by Birdman despite the technically marvelous cinematography and the performances of Watts and Riseborough, it deserves praise but it suffers under the weight of a bad score and some contrived moments.",

The highlight of course is its technical masterclass with astounding work in editing, cinematography and visual effects. But this is all thanks to Inarritu, whose vision is superbly realized. Keaton is fantastic as the troubled protagonist constantly seeking redemption, but credit must be given to the whole ensemble, who even with their short screen time, all definitively stand out, leaving us with a breathtaking film that immersing us in a man's conflict with society, which ultimately, is really a conflict with his own regrets.",

In my opinion Michael Keaton gave  his best performance yet from the dialogue delivery to his emotional   facial movements.\n\nThe characters were portrayed and written very well from Birdman to Mike Shiner.\n\nThe film has outstanding cinematography with some of the best shots I have ever seen.\n\nThe film is mostly set in a theatre showing the main stage and the backstage for nearly the entire film.\n\nThe film also has really good set design and props that put you into the scene incredibly well.\n\nI personally think that the film has a great style from the colour scheme to the cinematography.\n\nThe film also has some very good practical and special effects throughout the runtime of the film.\n\nThe film also has a very strong dialogue which is written and spoken really well.\n\nThe editing is exemplary with some of the best editing in cinema history. It's so good in fact that for nearly the entire movie it feels like one continues shot.\n\nThe film also has some very nice music that fits really well into the background.\n\nThe story is great from start to finish, and has a really strong and kind of uplifting ending.\n\nThe film also has some really strong comedy that had me laughing out loud throughout the movie.\n\nThe atmosphere is great especially when the characters were on stage.\n\nThe film is a little emotional at points, but not enough to cry over.\n\nThe film is also really enjoyable and just a great experience.\n\nOver all I give it a 10/10 - masterpiece",

I\u00f1\u00e1rritu ha diretto un film spettacolare, utilizzando la tecnica del piano sequenza con grande maestria per quasi l'intera durata della pellicola. Ovviamente il montaggio \u00e8 presente ma grazie a degli accorgimenti il film sembra un continuo flusso di avvenimenti. Michael Keaton \u00e8 stato semplicemente monumentale, interpretando il ruolo di un personaggio tormentato dal supereroe che lo ha reso famoso e che allo stesso tempo lo ha intrappolato all'interno della sua figura. Una sorta di ritratto della stessa carriera di Keaton, famoso per il ruolo di Batman a cavallo tra gli anni 80' e 90'; in poche parole meritava l'Oscar. Emma Stone bravissima, cos\u00ec come gli altri attori del cast, ma uno su tutti ci ha regalato una performance quasi a livello di quella di Keaton, ovvero Edward Norton, brillantissimo e calato alla perfezione nella parte; peccato che anche lui non abbia vinto agli Oscar. La fotografia mi \u00e8 piaciuta, soprattutto quando Reegan entra nel negozio di alcolici ed \u00e8 circondato da lucine di tutti i colori. Inoltre, come se non fosse abbastanza, In\u00e1rritu ci infila anche una critica pi\u00f9 che efficace ai blockbuster e a tutti quei film che mirano al solo guadagno, rischiando di compromettere la carriera di attori e attrici, come nel caso di Reegan e dello stesso Keaton. Stupendo!",

There are virtually to no cuts in the cinematography, and I can see how much that can turn someone off as hard as a grandmother's vacation slides. I think what I saw in this film was something that required a more analytical approach. The film mainly follows Thomson consistently, because the film wants us to see his stages of depression and fall from grace. Something that cuts, jumping the audience through time and space, may fail to do and have can leave out critical information.

            "content": "A well-written movie, with superb acting and phenomenal directing will usually get 4 and a half stars from me. To get 5, it needs to be that one element more special than just a fantastic movie. It has to be unique or a different perspective on a previously tackled subject. \"Birdman\" (or \"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\") fits that description and gets 5 stars only because it cannot get more. Every movie starts with a story. The story portrayed here is flawless. It is a brilliant story written in such a dark, nonsensical way, yet anchored with so much dialogue that 2 hours zooms by as the viewer tries hard to absorb it. It's the kind of story that leaves you talking about it, reading more about it and wanting to watch it again just to be sure you got it all. In that sense, it was perfect. To execute all of that dialogue, the casting and acting had to be perfect, and I see no way it could have been done more perfectly. The attraction to the initial construct of the story centers around a seemingly washed-up actor who, 20 years removed from his heyday, is seeking to be both respected as an actor and appreciated by the fans who left him long ago. However, as all good stories will include, the irony is, the meat of the story is not truly about that at all. Sure, it is peripherally, but the point of the film is about so much more than that. So, on the surface, getting Michael Keaton to play a role that is meant to lure audiences in thinking that the comparison to Michael's character, Riggin, and Michael himself is what the movie is about, but instead the audiences will be fed so much more. And to do that not only takes excellent writing, but also solid casting and acting. \"Birdman\" also perfectly does this. Since the majority of the film is about the pretension of acting as a whole, both in celebrity-driven Hollywood as well as the self-importance of the Broadway theater scene, it was vital to cast actors who have done both and can seriously, yet ironically, play those kinds of characters. Emma Stone and the brilliant Edward Norton solidify the execution of this story in a way that makes it so fun to absorb the deluge of dialogue in this 2-hour film. That brings us to directing. The gasoline in this machine, which relies heavily on how the acting carries out the dialogue and story, is rooted strongly in how the camera and direction guide the audience cinematically through it. The dizzying, sometimes frantic, pace of the camera work and the perception of a 2-hour single-shot film, is the main reason the acting and script is able to be absorbed by the audience. The chemistry of all of these elements are done so perfectly, that 4.5 stars was an easy award. What put \"Birdman\" over the top, however, is the sheer absurdity of its subject matter. The film is so schizophrenic, yet has to be in order to be coherent. It's a dark comedy. It's a drama. It's an exquisite study into the minds of the type of people who become actors, why they get sucked into the field, what tortures them throughout their careers and, in the end, how they wrestle with the drama that has to be created in their own lives to even continue on such a seemingly-futile balance of integrity and popularity. The definition of success as an actor is almost completely blurred. Then to attempt to blend any success in that craft with success in real life is just impossible. \"Birdman\" is such a farce, yet brilliantly constructed as an almost educational analysis of the industry that one walks out of the film simply amazed and nearly breathless trying to comprehend what had just been witnessed. \"Birdman\" is what filmmaking is all about and what is so rarely seen. It will be taught in universities for years. It deserves Oscar recognition for directing, best acting, best supporting acting and screenplay. It's just that good.",

            "content": "\"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" - or \"Birdman\" in short - has definitely become one of my all-time favourite movies, due to its overall excellence and uniqueness. \n\nCinematographically, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Lubezki have created an outright gem. To start off, the fairly eye-catching intent of making it seem like the film was all shot in one take works beautifully with the whole story (i.e. the functioning of a theater house and the people within) since it makes the story fluent and dynamic - though we'll come back to that later. Visually, this cinematography is accompanied surprisingly nicely by both props, set design and colour composition, given that a big part of the story takes place in a rather dark environment.\nIn addition to this - further building onto my previous point - the use of light in this movie is fascinating; I'd say that around about every setting could be analyzed to reveal meticulous eye for lighting and positioning of actors. Coloured lights are used every now and again, but not overdone, perfectly cohering with the story. With that, I'd also like to point out the remarkable ease of use of nearly 180 degrees of mirror every time one enters the frame - so fluently executed, one might not even notice it at first.\n\nApart from \"Birdman\" being nice to look at, it's also nice to listen to. The soundtrack boils down to a single percussion band accompanying the entire film, with the film dictating its pace as it goes, and the other way around. A handful of times, the music is used to induce a subtle fourth-wall break, which is a nice touch illustrating the fine balance between irony and - albeit depressing - realism in the plot.\nSpeaking of which: the story is, like I might or might not have suggested already, considerably fast-paced. It takes some time to get used to at first, but after that, it's hard to imagine the story working with a slower cadence (something the lack of cuts attributes to as well). What struck me most, is how quickly the characters get over certain conflicts, making the fairly intense emotions way more bearable to sit through: it's a unique kind of volatility, giving the story a level of freedom which helps it about so much better. Don't get me wrong though, this doesn't make the development of the different characters any less significant; dialogue is still very thought-out, and makes the viewer go through a rollercoaster of emotion and opinion.\n\nAll that said, this movie succeeds in every one of its aspects to not only convey its story and the idea behind it, but also to let the viewer enjoy nice cinematography. I think it's fair to say \"Birdman\" must've taken legendary crew efforts and posed great challenges for everyone involved, though the result is an incredibly marvelous film.",

From director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, comes the story of Riggan Thomson, a once popular movie star for his role as a crime fighting superhero named Birdman, who struggles with trying to get his play off its feet for the previews. Riggan, who is played by Michael Keaton, is an alcoholic loser who is afraid that society has forgotten about him. He is constantly in a state of euphoria due to his mental break downs in which he is able to talk to his imaginary Birdman character. Birdman is a physical representation of Riggan's conscience. Riggan is constantly losing grip of reality which causes him to hallucinate himself floating and flying throughout the city. His loss of reality also causes him to have terrible relationships, including his own daughter Sam, who is played by Emma Stone. Hoping to keep the play alive, Riggan hires a skilled, egotistical actor named Mike, who is played by Edward Norton. Mike causes all sorts of problems for Riggan, including trying to have sex on stage with another cast member and having a relationship with his daughter Sam. Through stunning visuals and wonderful performing, watch as Riggan's play starts to fall apart. Keaton's interpretation of Riggan creates many memorably awkward scenes that make you keep coming back to re-watch. Director I\u00f1\u00e1rritu constructs these wonderful scenes through amazing cinematography and fantastic camera editing that really sets the tone for story. During the film, he uses the chaotic sound of a solo drummer, performing a routine, to simulate problems and escalating situations. When the drumming begins, the audience is aware that something important is about to take place. Witness Riggan slowly start to understand his faults that he made during his life. He put all of his fame and faith on Birdman and is realizing that all good things eventually come to an end. The only person excited to be in the cast happens to be Lesley. Lesley, who is played by Naomi Watts, is a small-time actress finally excited to get her big break. Riggan interacts with others throughout the film including Zach Galifianakis playing his manager Jake, Amy Ryan as his ex-wife Sylvia, and Lindsey Duncan as a rotten critic Tabitha Dickinson. Birdman is full of surprises and funny moments while also being sad and dramatic to watch. From Mike getting drunk on stage and messing up an entire performance, to Riggan walking through Times Square almost naked, audiences will always be shocked and entertained by what they see. With such an interesting and complex ending, Birdman leaves a lot to the minds of the audience members by not showing or telling exactly what happens to conclude the film. This also creates a whole level of mystery that allows the audience to create their own vision and view for how the movie ended. I highly recommend that everyone should give Birdman a try. The story line is action packed while also being sophisticated and kept moving along. I was never bored nor tired while watching Keaton make a fool of himself on the big screen. Birdman is a terrific and beautiful story filled with twists and turns that captivate movie-goers all around the world.",

The stress and pressure mounts up from a possible lawsuit, a critic who'll do anything to sabotage his production for the sake of giving the play a scathing review, hiring his friend for a crucial role but is an excruciatingly difficult method actor and his daughter who just left rehab.  Keaton's character slowly suffers a melt down.\nAll the performances are incredible, especially Keaton which got him an Oscar nod.  Zach Galiafinakis, Edward Norton and Emma Stone are terrific in their supporting roles.  Creative, funny and thought provoking film that's highly recommended.",

I really, really respect it for it's different direction in film making and showcasing this new form beautifully but in a way that's exactly what it is. A \"showcase\" rather then a film. But wait? Isn't that what films are? Just a showcase? You see this film breaks the mould and get's you questioning \"what is film making?\" but at the same time I don't want to sound too pretentious myself.

Birdman is that kind of film and it will divide it's audience appropriately so. You will either think you get it or you just wont get it at all. \n\nThroughout the film Birdman is physicslly seen as a physical manifestation of the protagonist, Riggan Thomas(Michael Keaton) Birdman taunts and challenges Riggan to do better in his career and his performance and sometimes serves as an advocate for his strife. At times Riggan seemingly becomes Birdman and is able to use certain special abilities of Birdman behind closed doors. The film keeps you in the impression that its all in his head but then sometimes the film makes you think it's not.\n\nThere's a lot of little nuances and jabs at the  Hollywood grinder and the struggles of acting as a profession, they serve to round out the overall tone of the film.

            "content": "They made this film in one take. I reviewed it in one sentence.\nEvery once in a particularly blue moon comes a film that grabs you by the gut and refuses to let go, a film so dazzlingly original that you remain bewitched by its sheer audaciousness for days on end, and this is exactly what Birdman is - one of the wittiest, most well thought-out, and, might I add, trippiest films in recent memory, but that is hardly a surprise, given the fact that it was directed by acclaimed Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu, until now famous for helming the direction of devastating, emotionally-wrecking films like Love's a Bitch, Babel and Biutiful, who takes a complete detour here and delivers a complete rollercoaster of a ride, a film so ridiculously smart and funny, it will leave you feeling satiated the way few films have ever managed to, and this is largely due to its absolute cracker of a script, the basic gist of which is as follows - Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton in a killer comeback performance) is a complete washout of an actor, a man famous for playing the eponymous role in the Birdman trilogy of films that came out in the early 90s, a period when he experienced much appreciation, power and fame, and now two decades later, having refused a lucrative offer of starring in the fourth installment of the franchise, he is eager to make a comeback, writing, directing and starring in an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story titled \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" for Broadway at the prestigious St. James Theatre in New York, but Riggan has his task cut out big time, for there are a number of people who throw a spanner in his works - an egotistical star Mike Shiner (played by an excellent Edward Norton) who wrecks a preview of the play just because the gin he received on stage was water and not gin (and one who believes in getting an erection on stage to get into the skin of his character to boot), an ex-drug addict of a daughter, Sam (played by the gorgeous, gorgeous Emma Stone) who constantly berates him for his lack of recognition of the vitality of social media in an age of selfies and Twitter, a batty old theatre critic called Tabitha Dickenson (Lindsay Duncan), his primary nemesis, who is hell-bent upon trashing his film in the New York Times and completely destroying his play, a girlfriend named Laura (played by Andrea Risenborough) who might be pregnant, an ex-wife who constantly visits him (Amy Ryan in a stellar role) who, in one of the film's most hilarious scenes, reminds Riggan how he had thrown a kitchen-knife at her and minutes later declared his love for her, and, most of all, his alter-ego Birdman, a voice in his head that constantly criticizes his choice of Broadway as a medium for staging a comeback when all someone in his position really has to do is go back to playing those superhero roles he is so well-known for, and one that drives him to imagine the craziest of visions (not least of all the film's very opening scene in which we see him levitating three feet above the ground and which  pretty much sets us up for the outrageousness that is set to follow) - and needless to say, Riggan encounters one hurdle after another, even leaving him at a point where he believes all is lost and there is no hope of redemption, and whether or not he manages to overcome this lies at the very crux of this incredible film, one that is made even more incredible by its genius, genius cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, better known in film-circles as Chivo (Spanish for goat), but what he manages to accomplish here is hardly the work of one, for he manages to make our jaws drop in collective wonder and remain there for the entirety of the film's duration, admittedly something that was expected, given the fact that this is a man who had earlier delivered a sucker punch with his thrilling camerawork in Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity (and much deservedly won Oscar acclaim for it as well), but what Lubezki manages to achieve here is unprecedented and something that has only been seen earlier in master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock's Rope - he gives us the impression that the entire film, barring the last few minutes, has been shot in a single take, for the camera just keeps moving from stage to the terrace of St. James Theatre to the streets of New York in a fluid, breathtaking manner - and this is all the more admirable, given the fact that Innaritu took all of 30 days to complete shooting for this film, which, needless to say, would have involved an unbelievable, unbelievable amount of preparation and rehearsals from everyone involved in this outrageous project, from the actors themselves to the technicians and cameramen, for even the tiniest of mistakes, a tiny slip here, a mispronounced syllable there, would render the efforts of everyone else in that same take worthless and of no use, and as a result, let the entire crew down, which just goes to show how admirable it is that the entire film was shot in such an incredibly short span of time, but Lubezki and Innaritu have never been ordinary mortals, and here, in the best work of their respective filmographies, they amply demonstrate how filmmaking can be elevated by gifted craftsmen like them from a simple art to a work of awe-inspiring beauty, but let us digress from that for a moment and dwell upon the many nuances that the film has to offer, and nuances there are aplenty, for this a film with many layers, a film with subtext beneath its glossy, shining veneer, a film that manages to cunningly sneak home a point or two about celebrity culture, mankind's eternal need for recognition, and egotism even as it constantly bedazzles us with its sheer visual glory, which are pretty much running themes that serve as the backbone of this enterprise for the entirety of its running time, and this is perhaps best demonstrated in one of the film's most powerful scenes that Emma Stone pretty much knocks out of the park, featuring a devastating monologue she delivers in sheer frustration at her father's almost self-debilitating desire for fame and power, and his complete (thus far) ineptitude in achieving the same, and another one in which the play's producer and Riggan's best friend (played by an amiable Zach Galifianakis, in a complete U-turn from his The Hangover days) insists that Mike continue to remain on the play's cast for the massive star power he enjoys, which alone was responsible for most of the preview audience coming in in the first place, this despite him having publicly humiliated Riggan and nearly wrecked the entire play itself - it's a scene that speaks volumes about our obsession with stars and how production values and pretty much anything else in theatre will always take a back seat, one that hauntingly reminds us of ourselves even, and therein lies the power of this audacious film, a film laced with dialogue so rich it packs the power of dynamite - for instance, in response to Riggan reprimanding him for his outrageous actions a few minutes ago, Mike nonchalantly replies, \"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige, my friend\", and \"That's a nice bird, man!\" as he eats fried chicken in the wreck that the stage is, even while a horrified Riggan looks on in utter disbelief, a disbelief that we as an audience share incidentally, for I can't remember the last time that a film managed to enthrall so much, a film that grabs one by the balls and delivers a shot of adrenaline so acute it will leave one giddy with pleasure, and it is the wittiness of the writing and the laudable originality of the script that help elevate this sensation of awe-inspired wonder to an entirely new level, besides an absolute cracker of a soundtrack by Antonio Sanchez that is mostly jazz-based, the constant and feverish beating of the drums pretty much making me want to leave everything else and headbang for as long as my neck can hold, and that, ladies and gentleman, is the power of a good background score - it unfolds in a joyous, all-pervasive narrative of its own, and considering all this, one can't help but acknowledge that Birdman is one of the most technically proficient films to have come out of Hollywood in recent memory, and this is a welcome, joyous landmark for an industry that is otherwise much dreaded as an assembly-line of brain-dead big-budget crap that it somehow manages to churn out week upon week, year after year (are you listening, Michael Bay?), and this is why we should appreciate this little gem all the more and give it all the recognition it so rightfully deserves, besides sparing a thought for the magnificent Michael Keaton, who, like the character he plays, pretty much faded away from public memory and cinema after starring as Batman in two of Tim Keaton's films, an actor who deserved so much more with the sheer wealth of talent he has on offer but ended up getting sidelined in favour of the Adam Sandlers and Zac Efrons of a film industry that is barely capable of recognizing genuine, once-in-a-generation talent for what it is worth, and for that, we must doff our hats to Innaritu, a master filmmaker in complete control of his craft, indeed something that very few of his contemporaries, Wes Anderson for instance, can claim to be, and a man who has managed to pull off one of the greatest, most awe-inspiring miracles in the history of modern cinema: that glorious, glorious single take (it did contain a negligible number of cuts, but Lubezki knows his cinematography better than anyone else) is something that will be discussed and scrutinized closely in film circles for as long as movies are around, but in a film like this, almost anything (and everything) can't help but appear to be a tiny miracle in itself, given the sheer quality of filmmaking that is on display here, and Innaritu does appear to be a modern-day version of Midas, a master who changes anything he touches on the film set to gold - needless to say, this is a glorious, much-needed moment for indie filmmakers and connoisseurs of quality cinema alike, and I can't help but feel that is a film that SHOULD sweep a majority of the Oscars that it has been nominated for but will not, given the Academy's propensity for feel-good dramas and coming of age films, films that mostly come with a baggage of self-importance attached to them (Twelve Years A Slave...really???), but groundbreaking achievements like these don't really need a golden statuette to confirm their merit, for this is a film that any true lover of films and what they stand for will appreciate, a film that packs a punch and yet manages to remain frighteningly intelligent at the same time, and now that I have raved on and on for nearly two thousand words about how good this masterpiece is, throw aside anything else that you are doing, visit the nearest multiplex and soak in the glory of Innaritu's creation for all its worth, for it is an experience that is best enjoyed on the biggest of big screens that you can ever find, and watching it will be tantamount to watching your perception of what cinema can be change before your very eyes - for this is a film that belongs to the biggest of big leagues, one that you will be very unlikely to ever forget in the near future - so go ahead, experience an incredible journey that is as much a life-altering experience as it is a film about life itself, and on this rather fanboyish note, let me conclude with a quote by our winged hero himself: \"Let's go back one more time and show them what we are capable of!\"",

The colour palette and soundscape of this film work in perfect harmony with the long, lilting sequences, evoking a dreamy quality that, far from becoming tiresome, wraps you up in it's quiet grandeur.

            "content": "A well-written movie, with superb acting and phenomenal directing will usually get 4 and a half stars from me. To get 5, it needs to be that one element more special than just a fantastic movie. It has to be unique or a different perspective on a previously tackled subject. \"Birdman\" (or \"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\") fits that description and gets 5 stars only because it cannot get more. Every movie starts with a story. The story portrayed here is flawless. It is a brilliant story written in such a dark, nonsensical way, yet anchored with so much dialogue that 2 hours zooms by as the viewer tries hard to absorb it. It's the kind of story that leaves you talking about it, reading more about it and wanting to watch it again just to be sure you got it all. In that sense, it was perfect. To execute all of that dialogue, the casting and acting had to be perfect, and I see no way it could have been done more perfectly. The attraction to the initial construct of the story centers around a seemingly washed-up actor who, 20 years removed from his heyday, is seeking to be both respected as an actor and appreciated by the fans who left him long ago. However, as all good stories will include, the irony is, the meat of the story is not truly about that at all. Sure, it is peripherally, but the point of the film is about so much more than that. So, on the surface, getting Michael Keaton to play a role that is meant to lure audiences in thinking that the comparison to Michael's character, Riggin, and Michael himself is what the movie is about, but instead the audiences will be fed so much more. And to do that not only takes excellent writing, but also solid casting and acting. \"Birdman\" also perfectly does this. Since the majority of the film is about the pretension of acting as a whole, both in celebrity-driven Hollywood as well as the self-importance of the Broadway theater scene, it was vital to cast actors who have done both and can seriously, yet ironically, play those kinds of characters. Emma Stone and the brilliant Edward Norton solidify the execution of this story in a way that makes it so fun to absorb the deluge of dialogue in this 2-hour film. That brings us to directing. The gasoline in this machine, which relies heavily on how the acting carries out the dialogue and story, is rooted strongly in how the camera and direction guide the audience cinematically through it. The dizzying, sometimes frantic, pace of the camera work and the perception of a 2-hour single-shot film, is the main reason the acting and script is able to be absorbed by the audience. The chemistry of all of these elements are done so perfectly, that 4.5 stars was an easy award. What put \"Birdman\" over the top, however, is the sheer absurdity of its subject matter. The film is so schizophrenic, yet has to be in order to be coherent. It's a dark comedy. It's a drama. It's an exquisite study into the minds of the type of people who become actors, why they get sucked into the field, what tortures them throughout their careers and, in the end, how they wrestle with the drama that has to be created in their own lives to even continue on such a seemingly-futile balance of integrity and popularity. The definition of success as an actor is almost completely blurred. Then to attempt to blend any success in that craft with success in real life is just impossible. \"Birdman\" is such a farce, yet brilliantly constructed as an almost educational analysis of the industry that one walks out of the film simply amazed and nearly breathless trying to comprehend what had just been witnessed. \"Birdman\" is what filmmaking is all about and what is so rarely seen. It will be taught in universities for years. It deserves Oscar recognition for directing, best acting, best supporting acting and screenplay. It's just that good.",

In the scene, without spoiling it's memorable conclusion, Emma Stone's character looks down at the ground, and as she turns her focus to the sky, she starts to smile. A cut to black and you hear her laughing.\n\tThere are some key differences between Stone's character and I. The main one at that moment - she smiled for a brief second at the end, whilst I was smiling the whole time.\n\tThe film, usually referred to as simply BIRDMAN, was directed by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and written by him and three others (but you wouldn't be able to tell). The 2014 Oscar winner stars Michael Keaton as the titular character, Edward Norton as a method actor, Stone as Keaton's daughter, Zach Galifianakis as the assistant, Amy Ryan as Stone's mother and ex-wife to Keaton, Andrea Riseborough as a newcomer to Broadway, and Naomi Watts as Norton's girlfriend. The film received major critical praise when it was released on October 17, 2014, and ended up grossing in the 9 digits. The film went on to be nominated for 9 Oscars, winning 4, including Best Picture.\nEveryone in the cast, specifically Keaton, are immaculate in their roles. Keaton and Norton seem to literally embody their roles because of how meta their characters are - Keaton plays an actor who used to play a superhero but rejected an offer for a sequel and became obscure, while Norton has been known to be tough to get along with. Emma Stone gives her best performance as an addict just out of rehab and her relationship with her father makes for an interesting dynamic.\nThe star of the film, however, is none of the characters, or it's Oscar winning direction from I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, for that matter. No, the real showstopper is the cinematography, from fellow Mexican and 3 time Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki. The film is designed to look as if it was done in a single take - as either a way to show the inability to escape the path of emotion, like the director has claimed, or to mirror a Broadway play (the film centers around a play).\nThere isn't a single flaw noticeable throughout the entire film.

No one gave a better performance last year then Michael Keaton as a once famous actor who tries to stage a comeback by writing,directing and starring in a his own play on Broadway. Keaton has not been this great in years, I loved tthe whole element where Birdman is in his head talking to him and that scene where he hears him and makes a mess in his room. That is worth buying this movie on Bluray(when it comes out) alone. Just hearing Michael Keaton do his batman voice again. It was awesome, when you talk about Michael Keaton you immediately think Batman much like how in this film when people talk about Riggan Thomas they think Birdman.\nIt's about an actor desperately trying to step out of his former shadow and into a new light. Just in the hopes of being taken more seriously. It's an incredibly unique and moving film and while it's not all done in one consistent shot it's made to look like it is. This film is directed like its one continuous tracking shot and it's gorgeous. It's amazing. There is not a single actor who gave a bad performance in this. The standouts for me other then Keaton where Emma Stone and Edward Norton I just loved seeing them on screen playing their characters and getting invested. Zach Galafanakis holy crap he was great in this I mean Galafanakis can do drama who knew.\nThis movie was captivating, original, funny, their is not enough a person could say about Birdman. I give Birdman a four and a half out of five.",

            "content": "Alejandro gonzalez spearheads the 2014 Drama/film comedy \"Birdman\" into a thought provoking narrative that explores the differences between power,popularity,and prestige.\nThe story revolves around Riggan thomson (Michael keaton) who is the former superhero character \"birdman\",(Which is no secret that the superhero is a literal euphemism for \"Batman\") as he is at the helm of an ambitious broadway production that he desperately hopes to breath life into his irrelevant status and career.Throughout the hectic theatrical production there are many characters who aid riggan and who play roles in their theatrical roles that cause a slight paradoxical confusion.During the plodding progression of the film we start see from the perception of riggan that his theatrical play personifies his biggest hopes and fears.This feeling riggan experiences is constant,always impelling him to lose hope and fear while sometimes regaining hope and losing fear.There are many pivotal characters that act as this fickle stimulus for riggan,such as,once riggan acquires renowned talent in cinema Mike shiner (Edward norton),he advertently ruins the first screening due to his grievance with the lack of alcohol on stage.This action coincides with a more forthright response from riggan's daughter Sam(Emma stone),who gives a disgruntled and impassioned eulogy on why his theatrical play is a futile attempt to stay relevant.The neglect of feeling for riggan and botched rehearsals is prevalent throughout the film's timeline.We see early on in the film the plight riggan has to carry which leads him to find a positive incentive through his conflicting internal psyche \"birdman\",who embodies an affinity for \"The devil on the shoulder\".The \"Birdman\" is a literal figment of riggan's imagination that's emphatically telling riggan to ignore criticism and embrace his superheroic persona,this proposition drives riggan into a drunken stupor and sometimes near suicide,which is evident by the end of the film when riggan shoots himself as a display of devotion through realism,which unexpectedly warranted his film to be a triumphant success.\n\nIllustrious seasoned actress Emma Stone displays her character in a disgruntled and sometimes troubled nature quite well,but on the contrary there seems to be a lack of screen time for her character \"Sam\" but she still manages cultivate her skill though expression rather than dialogue by most notably conveying anger and indignation in her wild impassioned rage.A skew from seasoned actors is \"Edward norton\" who never ceases to impress by giving a praisable,effortless performance as his similar contemporary Mike shiner who will make you blissfully grin in amuse through his charming and conceited demeanor.Lastly The prime actor \"Michael Keaton\" convincible plays the part of Riggan thomson:a man nearly beaten into submission by life's adversities,while also arresting his audiences with his pensive non verbal gazes.\n\nAlejandro gonz\u00e1lez introduces an unconventional style of cinematography that will garner many shockful eyes which will unmistakable appeal to modern audiences.Gonzalez manipulates the camera into seeming like it's filmed into one prolonged tracking shot with such fluidity that you won't be able to spot errors in editing,because it's simply devoid of any.This type of indigenous cinematography has been applied to his other film projects such as \"The Revenant\".He chose this unorthodox style for the sole purpose of creating and giving the illusion that the camera is you and the director wants you to stay congruous with the frantic and informal progression of the behind the scenes atmosphere of a broadway show.\n\nUnfortunately alejandro's theme is so obvious and forceful it feels patronizing towards its audiences.In the title \"Birdman\" there is a clear subtitle that reads \"The unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\",this is explicitly shown by the end of the film,by a broadway film critic,Tabitha.Her headline clearly translates to a \"unexpected talent throught a lack of knowledge\".Its theme from riggan's experience is those who have talent can affort to be ambitious for the likelyhood of success is in your favor.In conclusion \"Birdman\" is a work of sublime craftsmanship,thankfully due to its strong commentary on riggan thomson's viseral fears and hopes that identically mirors and reasonates with keaton's own career.",

It's inevitable that this nonstop anxiety, this constant moving for weeks at a time, is all going to lead to demise.  And when we finally do get a break, a cut in the film, it's to assure us that this man has reached the peak of his insanity and now we're about to settle down.  No, that's just the calm before the storm, the perfect effect for what is about to happen next.  We are trapped in a grand delusion, what success has done to entrap our very subject. Birdman is a more proactive Norma Desmond from Sunset Boulevard, and as an aging male in the business he has an advantage over her, not to mention having worked in an era of sequels and inflated box office.  His fall from stardom is something he's trying to run from, but it chases him and gets clearer as we move into the second half of the film.  That the one shot illusion is used represents that this one major beat of insanity is attached to a long string of anxiety-building events - they all equate to this one moment, and one cannot possibly be disconnected from the other.  There's so much meaning in that kind of staging, it's not just there to demonstrate it can be done, not a mere technical marvel, but a total view of life in the mind of a suicidal.",

            "content": "Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu , the first Mexican film director to be nominated for Oscars has created movies that have resulted in hit after hit with critics everywhere and his newest project is certainly capable of continuing that thread. His newest offering is Birdman, a film which proves that technical aspects can make just as big an impact on audiences as plot and characters can.\n\nBirdman (or the unexpected virtue of ignorance) follows faded film star Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) who is directing and acting in an adaptation of \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" on Broadway in New York. Despite his high position in the play however, Riggan's profession is anything but enjoyable; he often argues with his colleagues, and his relationship with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is fragile at best. Riggan dreams of returning to Birdman, an eighties superhero series that made him famous and as we see, this dream has become an obsession, creeping into his mind at several moments to feed his ego for acting. The film mostly follows Riggan as he interacts with the other characters and makes preparations and rehearsals for the play's opening night. The pacing is as tight as it gets for a drama; there are no slow scenes where little happens or any moments that take place a day or two later. The film stays on task with the plot it sets out to convey and as such, never loses the audience's attention; you just can't take your eyes off the film because there's always something going on. The film's only real problem is that towards the end, many of the characters who played sizeable roles and had strong interactions with Riggan don't really receive any kind of payoff. Does Mike Shiner (Ed Norton) overcome his arrogant ways? Does Lesley (Naomi Watts) go on to something bigger on Broadway? None of these questions are answered as the film focuses its entire attention on concluding Riggan's story. Whilst Birdman's ending does leave a lot to be desired, the journey there is more than worth it, laced with a wide array of humorous and memorable moments.\n\nDespite not getting the closure they deserve, Birdman's characters are all very well rounded and interesting. Keaton is very intriguing and charismatic as Riggan Thomson, arguably one of the best roles he has had in years. Playing off both his obsession with Birdman and his management of the play, it makes for a highly unpredictable character arc; will he return to the series that made him famous or will he step back into the spotlight some other way? I found Riggan to be slightly similar to the character of Willy Loman from Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman in that he finds himself absorbed in his visions of Birdman; these scenes do a great job of emphasising just how much the Birdman character means to the protagonist. The other side characters played by Ed Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts may not have as much focus as Keaton but they all bring their own talents to the film; Norton as the arrogant, full-of-himself Mike Shiner and Stone as Riggan's recovering addict daughter in particular have some great chemistry on screen. All told, it's clear the cast members of Birdman are working at their best to make the character's presence felt throughout the film.\n\nBirdman's cinematography is simply a stroke of genius; outside of three other takes, the film is shot without any kind of normal transitions. The camera continuously and constantly follows the characters, transferring seamlessly between scenes as they move about the different rooms and areas of the theatre environment and when the action is confined to a static location, such as when the characters are rehearsing the play, the camera will rotate, giving a varied view of the proceedings. The film's use of a single take means that we never leave the perspective of the characters and the film's pacing is always moving forward, keeping the audience engaged. The interesting techniques don't end here; there's also an extensive use of mirrors during character conversations which places greater emphasis on the emotive side of the cast's performances. Drums and other instruments enter the film to signify the more intense moments and a minimal use of computer generated imagery is present to put across Riggan's wild imagination and desire to return to the titular superhero he was once renowned for. Overall Birdman's presentation compliments the plot incredibly well, tying in with the hectic nature of putting on a play at the theatre.\n\nAside from a lack of closure in its ending, Birdman is nevertheless a very well-crafted movie; the cast all turn in brilliant performances, drawing you into the story and the film's fascinating editing style is something that has to be seen to be believed.",

Er wirkt friedlich, doch in seinem Inneren - eine knurrende grummelige Stimme, die auf ihn einredet... Dann sehen wir Birdman wieder, wie er wie ein Wahnsinniger \u00fcber den Times Square rast. Er hat sich aus seinem Theater ausgeschlossen. Das sind die Extreme, durch die Regisseur Alejandro G. Inarritu mit Birdman steuert - voller k\u00fchner Ambitionen und spektakul\u00e4rem handwerklichen Geschick! Es scheint auch so, dass der fr\u00fcher so schicksalstr\u00e4chtige Inarritu zum ersten Mal Spass gehabt h\u00e4tte! Birdman jedenfalls ist von Anfang bis zum Ende eine einzige Wucht! Ein zweieinhalb st\u00fcndiger Film, gefilmt von Emmanuel Lubezki in einem Take. Ein B\u00fchnendarsteller fiel aus, weil ihm eine Lampe auf den Kopf fiel. Riggan (Michael Keaton), Hauptdarsteller und Regisseur des Broadway St\u00fccks, welches in zwei Wochen Premiere haben soll, fragt nach einem m\u00f6glichen Ersatz, der gerade kein Spandex tr\u00e4gt. Riggan selbst hat fr\u00fcher auch mal einen Superhelden gespielt - das und sein Erfolg als Schauspieler liegen allerdings weit zur\u00fcck. Michael Keaton selbst spielte seit den 90ern nur noch Nebenrollen und konnte so mit seiner Figur verschmilzen. Mit seinem Broadway St\u00fcck aber will Riggan beweisen, dass er auch noch ein seri\u00f6ser Schauspieler ist (obwohl alle ihn nur nach der alten Super Hero Rolle fragen). Wann wird er endlich Birdman IV drehen? Birdman sitzt ihm zus\u00e4tzlich im Nacken als Alter Ego, der ihm auch noch den Tipp gibt, lieber Action zu machen als diesen deprimierenden philosophischen Mist. Die Handlung folgt einem klassischen \"Hinter den Kulissen\" - St\u00fcck, in dem die Tage vor der Premiere von Katastrophen gepr\u00e4gt sind. Seine j\u00e4mmerliche Geliebte (Andrea Riseborough) glaubt schwanger zu sein, seine B\u00fchnen-Partnerin (Naomi Watts) schleppt ihren Freund, das Schwein (Edward Norton), an, der mit Riggans Tochter (Emma Stone) flirtet (dabei hatte die gerade einen Entzug). Schliesslich taucht auch noch die Exfrau (Amy Ryan) auf, um alte Wunden aufzureissen, w\u00e4hrend der Agent (Zach Galifianakis) verzweifelt versucht, alles irgendwie zusammen zu halten... Jeder braucht jeden in Birdman. Zach Galifianakis als Manager spielt an gegen Keaton inmitten des ganzen Wahnsinns (und doch auch mit ihm!). Emma Stone ist wundervoll als Riggans schwache und klugscheisserische Tochter, die aber auch noch so etwas wie seine Assistentin darstellt. Amy Ryan als Exfrau sieht beides in ihm: Sowohl das Hassenswerte als auch das Gute. Naomi Watts wiederum spielt ebenfalls beides: Die harten, aber auch die lichten Momente einer Neurotikerin. Das Ergebnis: Ein Film, der so viel Spass macht wie kaum einer dieses Jahr! Dazu gibts die witzigsten phantastischen Kom\u00f6dien in unserer Film List auf cinegeek.de",

There are a lot of social media around there, such as Twitter, Facebook or YouTube. In Birdman, there were several plots showed that how can these media impact a show or a person. Moreover, how can a voice in your head influence you? That's what this movie was talking about. This movie happened on New York Broadway, which talked about a washed out former star. He always heard a voice from a character he used to play, which was Birdman. The movie is based on this to tell a story of this guy's life.\n\tRiggan (Michael Keaton) was a quite famous actor who used to play Birdman. He started his new career at Broadway, and these days he started rehearsal his first show, but there was an extremely creditable movie reviewer whom would write a bad review whether she watched the show or not. And then there was the first emergency that they needed find a new guy to substitute another guy that accidently got hit. The actress from the show, Laura (Andrea Riseborough), said she knew Mike (Edward Norton) who was quite famous at that time can substitute the gap. Mike's acting was quite awesome, but his behavior was not that pleasant. Along the time, Riggan always can hear a voice from 'Birdman', which he hated, talks to him and wanted to convince him he is Birdman. Throughout the whole movie, there were several points always remind Riggan that he is the Birdman. For example, when he was in a bar on Broadway there were few fans wanted to take photo with Riggan as a Birdman player, and then when he naked walk through the Time Square there were some people wanted his signature and photo. These parts made Riggan think he might be the birdman in some ways. When Riggan was struggling with his first show, his daughter said a lot of stuff to him. Such as, ' it's not for the sake of art. It's because you want to feel relevant again. Well, there's a whole world out there where people fight to be relevant every day'. Due to this talk he started thinking what he really wants. When they were rehearsal, Mike told Riggan he could easily find out he was using a fake gun, and then during the real show he pulled outa real gun and shot himself. That made everyone know him mostly from social media, but in the movie Riggan doesn't like social media, but the fact was the social media helped he a lot in his first show. It also showed that nowadays people are addicted to their online social life.\n\tUsing drumbeats as the background music were quite impressive, because the beats lead the tempo of the movie and would make audiences and movie have a strong connection. With the drum, audiences would get more into the movie. Furthermore, the whole movie was a continuous one shoot, therefore, all actors had to be extremely related. It's quite hard for all actors, because they all had so many lines to remember and they all needed a good acting. Moreover, the only one take style might make audiences thinking during the whole movie instead of just watching a movie not even thinking.\nI think this movie is more like adult movie, which the parents better not bring their children to watch it. In the movie there were some clips about drugs, smoking and sexual related. Maybe parents can go watch it as a date night movie.",

This is an actor who you could argue had barely attained relevancy in twenty years, and here it really works for him, pushing character Riggan to the actual brink of insanity. \nYou can also believe that after the whole Incredible Hulk debacle that Edward Norton really is that kind of ridiculously anal arsehole to work with. \n\nWith its ingenious one shot camera trickery, no doubt you will feel a touch confused and perhaps even struggle to match the rather frantic pace of Birdman.

            "content": "'Birdman' Review: Brilliant and Smart, Perfect Keaton Performance - 9ish.\n\n\"Birdman\" is all about reputation and redemption. Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton) was once an iconic superhero, hence the title. Thompson decides to revamp his acting career by writing, starring and directing his own adaption of Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\" Thompson faces multiple problems around every corner.\n\nHe finds an actor that the Broadway audience adores, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), and everything seems to be falling into place. Thompson then has altercations with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), with himself - and, it seems, with the world. Constantly battling production issues, he also fights the voice inside his head that taunts him to ultimately try and redeem himself.\n\n\"Birdman: or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" to use its full title - is about crisis and how Thompson handles it. He wants to call himself beloved, and to feel himself beloved on earth, to paraphrase the opening of the film.\n\nAlejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, who also picked up Oscars for directing and writing, has made an incredible movie. It's an ambitious stab at magical realism, with many scenes featuring Keaton moving things with his mind and flying through New York City.\n\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who also picked up an Oscar, achieve an amazing feat by making \"Birdman\" appear to be just one shot with such smooth style. Most of the cuts are hidden within the pans and are so well done, it makes it incredibly hard to catch them. In the DVD's special features, the actors talk about the difficulty involved with such long, continuous scenes. If they messed up the end, it meant starting all over again.\n\nMichael Keaton is outstanding and it's hard to believe he didn't win Best Actor at the Oscars. It's ironic as well, because in reality, Keaton is mirroring his character. As Thompson is escaping \"Birdman,\" Keaton is escaping his iconic performance as \"Batman.\"\n\nIn \"Birdman,\" we follow Thompson around and experience his claustrophobic life within the tight walls of the St. James Theater in New York City. He battles his alter ego while balancing on the fence of insanity. At times he's a burning comet soaring through the sky, while in others he's a dead jellyfish lying on the beach to rot (check the special features for that reference).\n\nThere are three bonus features included on the DVD/Blu-ray. The best extra is \"Birdman: All-Access.\" This is an awesome insight to the making of the movie, a behind-the-scenes look at the process and the actors' and actresses' thoughts. There is an in-depth interview with Michael Keaton and Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu about the movie, and the package includes stills from the set.\n\nNorton and Stone both received supporting actor nominations and are well deserving of them. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu brought out the best in the rest of the cast including Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough.\n\n\"Birdman\" is an incredible experience coated with brilliant acting, writing and cinematography, and is an outstanding movie that will be talked about for years to come.\n\nCheck out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!",

Eventually, he thinks he is too big for the role and spins off into a new career on Broadway.  His show sells out and is popular, but he often fights with the cast, he lacks professionalism, and is depressed that he likely made the wrong decision to stop being Birdman.  A voice in his head leads him and chaos follows.\n\n\"Why did we break up?\"\n\"Because you threw a kitchen knife at me.\"\n\nAlejandro Gonzales, director of The Revenant, Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful, To Each his Own Cinema, and September 11, delivers Birdman.  The storyline for this picture is an interesting character piece with many unique elements, unexpected action, and random events.  The acting is very good and the cast includes Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, and Naomi Watts. \n\n\"Smells like balls.\"\n\nThis was added to HBOGO a couple months ago and I was excited to finally get a chance to watch this.  This was different and surprising in many ways.  I really enjoyed the script and thought it was well done.  This is a movie you will likely only need to see once, so I wouldn't add it to the DVD collection, but this is worth your time and entertaining.\n\n\"She does look like she licked a homeless man's ass.\"\n\nGrade: B+/A-",

            "content": "I cheated a little bit here: I'd actually seen the first 10 minutes or so of Birdman before, but switched off for one reason or another. It certainly wasn't alienation that turned me to tune off: I had been itching to watch it properly for a long time.\n\nRevisiting was a very, very good idea. If you haven't seen this Alejandro G I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Babel and the upcoming The Revenant) beauty, stop reading this garbage and get cracking.\n\nIf for whatever reason you're still here, I'll continue. The plot is simple to grasp: Riggan Thomson, played by Michael Keaton (who of course played Batman) is a washed up action star who used to play the titular Birdman in a series of superhero movies. There's more to him than it seems though: he displays ambiguous signs that his superhero role may not have been an act.\n\nIn a bid to reclaim his stardom and financial security, he is running a play on Broadway in unison with Jakes, his lawyer and chum played by Zach Galifianakis of the Hangover fame. Galifianakis is on form, playing a more intellectual role than that he is typecast in, akin to his role in the excellent but short-lived TV series Bored To Death.\n\nThrow in an array of extra talent, most notably Emma Stone as Thomson's troubled daughter and Ed Norton as an acclaimed Broadway actor drafted in at short notice to star opposite his girlfriend, played by Naomi Watts.\n\nEach share screentime relatively evenly behind Keaton, stealing scenes in their own right. As the show's opening night approaches, with preview after preview performance, the pace of the movie continuing to increase accordingly. Characters and their storylines intertwine into a complex but very coherent mess.\n\nThere are constant shouts to theatre throughout, almost as though this is a play recorded for the silver screen. Researching online, it seems rehearsals were rigorous to get the flow of the film down to an art. The hard work pays off. The start is jarring: you're thrown in at the deep end, but you're soon up-to-speed and glad of your front row seat.\n\nThe cinematography is subtle yet stunning (it did win an Academy Award for cinematography as a nod). It's appropriately dark and moody backstage, and bright when the cast take to the stage.\n\nEach shot is stitched together seamlessly. Every transition is sleeker than the last, often following a character out of one room and into another down the winding corridors of the theatre. It's deliberately fast-paced, claustrophobic, and a thing of beauty.\n\nSolo jazz drumming is the only real music here, interspersed between each 'scene', the term used loosely. It's noticeable louder and panicked in times of stress, and soothing in rare moments of clarity. When the movie approaches its conclusion, the music reaches a peak.\n\nThe conclusion, whilst perhaps erring towards anti-climactic, is still a triumph. For a film that builds up to opening night, it doesn't disappoint. You aren't left wanting more. Every loose end is tied up nicely.\n\nIt's more than satisfying end to a treat of a film. But this is more of a film. This is a love letter to thespian farce, a worthy Oscar winner and a time investment I'd gladly make again. The only tragedy here is that I won't get to enjoy this for the first time once again.",

It sums up what many on the \"more artistic\" and thought-provoking side (not Pop side) of the film industry find wrong with said industry. And it is probably the only \"Super-Hero\" movie that will ever win best film. Quite fitting! Even though I like some of the big Blockbuster film franchises, I can tend to agree with much of the critiques of it and I greatly enjoy quality, deep, and artful films as well. Unfortunately they tend to get overshadowed by the big budget franchises of the world. But they get their shine at the Oscars.

Right from the start we are asked to go to work, for we see Riggan levitating in meditation. Is he really levitating? Is he an alien? A magician? Is he just imagining he's doing this? And there's also someone else in the room, for we hear a voice, but no one else seems to be there, at least physically. Eventually we see that it's Birdman, a successful character Riggan has played in the past (and that's what drives the film, the need for success and acceptance of audience and critic to validate one's existence as an actor, that success being made evident in Birdman, the voice driving Riggan on). \n\nThe film is full of flair and the engaging. One technique used is the almost dreamlike, surreal coming in and out of characters. At times the characters even  ignore what's occurring immediately to emphasize the surreal. There are also great moments of dark comedy in statements made that, unlike forced comedy in comedy-specific genres, are so sincere that the viewer can't help but guffaw. And if you like drums, you're in for a treat, for the scat beat of Birdman (allusion to Charlie Parker, not a drummer but jazz artist) plays throughout a good portion of the film. This is Riggan trying to get back up on his feet, to get his career restarted, but most of the film that's not happening, represented by the sputtering drum fills. \n\nIt's quirky. It's whimsical. It's poignant, funny, and just damn mesmerizing. The acting, the oft thick dialogue, the angst, the manic passages, all work in combination to make this a most joyous experience. Oh, so is Birdman an alien? Can he really levitate and use telekinetic powers? Is he going insane? Is he hearing voices? Is it all just made up in his mind? The film gets you thinking in that direction until the final moment of the final scene as Sam spy's her father out the window apparently fluttering about high above the streets below. Or is he? Ya just got to love a film that can keep you so off balance and so engaged. Birdman, a true flight of wonder.",

            "content": "At a time when the studios appear reluctant to produce anything that doesn't have certified provenance, along comes Birdman, an entertaining, ambitious and mostly effective backstage satire that delights in mocking Hollywood's franchise obsession.\n\nDirected by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Babel, 21 Grams, Amores Perros) Birdman is the story of Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) a has-been Hollywood actor - once famous for playing superhero Birdman - who seeks to restore his artistic credibility by directing and starring in an ambitious Broadway show - his own adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". When one of his actors is hit by a falling stage light and is replaced by the egocentric loose cannon Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) Thomson now has to battle not only his inner demons (his Birdman alter ego) but also a shameless scene-stealer.\n\nTo add further weight on Thomson's shoulders, his manager/producer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is stressing about the very likely possibility they'll both come out of this venture broke. His daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), has just come out of rehab and is angry at everything. His co-star/girlfriend, Laura (Andrea Riseborough), thinks she may be pregnant. And his other co-star, Lesley (Naomi Watts), is in an insecure lather about her first Broadway performance. On top of all that, the New York Times theatre critic, Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) has taken great offence at Hollywood setting foot on hallowed Broadway turf and has vowed to kill his show with the worst review she has ever written.\n\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu has shrewdly pieced together Thomson's existential crisis as if it is one long take - though the actual time frame of the story takes place over a number of days. Accompanied by a kinetic all-percussion score by Antonio Sanchez, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki takes us on a ride - up corridors, through windows, across stages, along New York streets - that is mostly exhilarating. The first forty-five minutes or so are a delightful m\u00e9lange of energy, humour, music, movement and sharp performance. I was grinning, realising I hadn't been so entertained at the movies in a very long time.\n\nBut while the film as a whole never quite loses its steam, its narrative drive does soften and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu tends to rely a little too heavily on his showmanship. The barbs regarding the superficiality of Hollywood grow repetitive, as do the denunciations of Thomson as a worthless hack. Subplots are underexplored. The characters of Jake, Lesley and Laura are underutilized while theatre critic, Dickinson, is afforded too much weight and her anti-Hollywood rant is anachronistic at best.\n\nThe 'look-at-me' flashiness is sure to be dismissed as pretension and the relative thinness of the plot may leave some unsated. But through the smoke of this collision of ideas, technique and tones is the brilliance of Keaton. Sure, he was made for this role, but what he brings to Thomson is so much more than what is in the script. Angst oozes out of every pore. There isn't a whiff of inauthenticity about his anxieties though his rapprochement is too easily realised and the film's resolution is unnecessarily abstruse - and perhaps a little too affected.\n\nKeaton's supporting ensemble is fantastic. It's refreshing to see Galifianakis successfully navigate a straight role. Emma Stone proves once again she is the most interesting actress of her generation right now. Watts reminds us that she truly is an actress of substance. Riseborough is both funny and empathetic and sure to be on our screens a lot more in the future. And Norton is hilarious, skilfully treading that fine line between parody and overacting.\n\nA cynical eye could easily unpack this film and expose its flaws. But to do so would be missing the point. Birdman is intended as a delicious ride. Its adrenal affects will naturally subside once you leave the cinema. But I\u00f1\u00e1rritu demonstrates that superheroes are not the only protagonists who can entertain and attract an audience. Indeed, this extremely damaged and fragile hero not only does that, he does what those other caricatures are unlikely to ever do - touch people and win awards.",

Half way through I almost turned it off, but I stuck with it hoping it had something, anything, to offer. But alas, there was nothing there.\nBirdman offers us two things. The first is a pouty, childish lashing out at comic/franchise action movies which really reeks of nothing but jealousy, from both the movies main character and the director. At one point during the movie I even wondered if Keaton was the director and writer, pining over his forgotten Batman performance and maybe Birdman was autobiographical. While comic action movies might not be to everyones tastes, they do at least provide entertainment. The sad, dreary, lifeless intellectualism the movie seems to crave, without offering, is probably best sort after in books, and even plays, as those mediums have little to offer visually. But whether it's special effects or amazing cimematography, movies must be visually entertaining. Birdman even fails this, wasting movie money on a story best suited to a short opinion piece in a newspaper or blog. In fact, \"I don't like comic franchise movies\" is everything the movie has to say, without the 2 hours and the budget.\nThe other thing Birdman attempts to give us is an examination of psychological breakdown, which it could have done quite well if it wasn't trying so hard to be preachy about entertainment being entertaining instead of dreary. But what effort and integrity the movie had to offer on this issue, was thrown away with the sappy, magical ending where the psychosis comes to life, which seems to be the kind of thing the movie just spent nearly two hours complaining about. If you want a movie about psychosis, Fight Club does a much better job. In fact it's sad to see Edward Norton in Birdman after watching his brilliance in Fight Club.\nOne of the worst movies I have ever seen, one of the worst stories I have ever heard, and if I had paid to watch this instead of seeing it on tv I would do like Stan and Kenny and track down the people who made it and demand a refund.",

Birdman ou (A Inesperada Virtude da Ignor\u00e2ncia) - sim, o t\u00edtulo \u00e9 esse mesmo - conta a hist\u00f3ria de Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), um ator que j\u00e1 fez muito sucesso no passado, mas que hoje busca se reconstruir profissionalmente com uma pe\u00e7a que pode custar toda a sua carreira. Nisso, vemos toda a tens\u00e3o psicol\u00f3gica que assombra a mente do ator, que s\u00f3 piora com o decorrer do filme. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, o diretor, utiliza-se de sua metafic\u00e7\u00e3o para criticar o cinema moderno e seu p\u00fablico, que parece dar mais valor \u00e0 filmes de a\u00e7\u00e3o exagerada e sem nexo algum, esquecendo dos valores tradicionais da s\u00e9tima arte.

Talvez essa tenha sido a jogada fatal de Birdman, porque no mais, \u00e9 um filme como outro qualquer, chato, pra falar a verdade.

I really liked the photography and direction of the movie. Some of the shots were really really nice but overall I was left with a feeling of dizziness from all the weird angles. The storyline was OK but nothing special I would say. The acting from Keaton was exemplary as was the one from Norton and Galifianakis, but they alone could not save a movie that was (a) script less and (b) all over the place during most of the film. \n\nI did not appreciate the constant noise from drums and other instruments and I definitely did not like all this constant confusion. I liked the effect with the special powers and they way in which the director handled the taxi scene where you understand that he's just a man after all. I did not care for the mixed up ending as well. From my point of view, I think that what happened after the gun shot, was in his mind for this brief moment before he passed away. He did not shoot his nose from point blank and he did not miraculously lived from that! He can't have. \n\nThis is a nice finding as well but we could do with a more concrete proof that indeed that's the ending. Having his daughter looking low and then high in the air and seeing him fly or not. No, that's just something I don't care about. I like my movies to end in the end and not go online and search about it, thank you very much. \n\nI did not like all the emphasis on the movie critic. She actually pushed him to suicide, doing nothing more in the movie, sitting there and drinking in the same bar, actually having 4-5 lines. What's that about? Is it to blame it on the theater critics in general? Is this a statement? I think not. As for Keaton, he is also a really fragile and strong character at the same time, with no will to live, hanging, barely on his own breath, trying to survive minute by minute. He has depicted really well his character, indeed, but it's the character himself that I did not like. What's he about? He's miserable and pathetic and then a theater critic pushes him over the edge and he just kills himself... Really? In general, all the characters were depicted on a superficial level (someone would expect the opposite them being actors and all) not allowing the viewer to relate or merely to understand their actions and pick sides. \n\nHaving watched all the other Oscar nominated actors and movies, Birdman was a true disappointment of a movie. The only thing that saves the day is the performance of Keaton, even playing a character not worthy of much.",

It felt like it was a bunch of scenes thrown together just to give the actors the chance to do some emotional acting.  So, there is great acting, but it doesn't mold an interesting story together.  Again, most scenes just feel like an excuse to let the actors show their stuff.  This is great, but only if you care about the characters.

A pet project which is costing him in ways which cannot be counted in currency and met with resistance by on-and-off stage arguments with a difficult co-star, a spiteful theatre critic, his own family members and even his own alter ego, a constant reminder that he had it all as the big Hollywood star of a comic book franchise. Confused yet? The story, which draws comparisons with Shakespeare's Macbeth, is as labyrinthine as the set on which it takes place, but what does make Birdman a marvel to behold is the cinematography, lighting, editing and visual effects which make the movie feel as though it were all filmed in one take, with barely any visible cuts and camera movements which flow around the set without skipping a beat (even passing two actors stood in front of a mirror without casting a reflection).\nEverything about the film is cinematic genius, but simply won't be appreciated by everyone.

And Edward Norton is the king of pompous and pretentious. It's like the screenwriters are trying to impress us with how cool they are. There's a scene where they forcefully and angrily argue, like it really matters, whether you should say \"I didn't know the guy\" in 3 lines or 1 line. And another scene where the main character goes to get fitted for his costume and gets naked in front of some women. And there's big discussion about what he did. Like it really matters. And then the main character flies off the handle in front of the audience and they stop the play. Like it really matters. I suppose if you're an actor then stuff like this would be interesting and pertinent, but for the rest of us it's just gimmicky and self-absorbed and pompous and stupid.

It was written by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo. The film stars Michael Keaton with a supporting cast of Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. The story follows Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a faded Hollywood actor famous for his role as superhero \"Birdman\", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver.\nThe film covers a two week period of previews leading to a Broadway opening. The story is filmed as if in a single long take. The script took two years to write, post-production was planned in detail, rehearsals required several weeks. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, Regency Enterprises and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.\nBirdman had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14, grossing more than $103 million worldwide. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with the Best Director for I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the Best Original Screenplay, and the Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with The Grand Budapest Hotel for being the most nominated film of the Academy's 87th annual awards ceremony. It also won the Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.\n\n-Birdman was edited by Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both worked with the director before on 21 Grams and Babel.\n\n--Critical response:\n-Birdman received critical acclaim, particularly for Keaton, Norton and Stone's performances; I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's direction; the screenplay; and Lubezki's cinematography. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 92% based on 260 reviews, and an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Birdman is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".",

            "content": "Being an actor must be one of the most psychologically tasking professions that man has yet created. You're asked to move from skin to skin, from soul to soul, from psychology to psychology, from paying gig to paying gig, and also to traverse the minefield of box office success. If you're successful, you're asked to do this with breakneck rapidity. It's no wonder some actors succumb to mental breakdowns and unhealthy choices.\n\nMichael Keaton understands this better than anyone else. From Night Shift in 1982 to The Dream Team in 1989, he established himself as one of the most likable comedians in the business. Then he was improbably cast in the coveted role of Batman, leading many to regard the news with \"Really? Mr. Mom?\" But the movie would become one the highest grossing and most beloved action movies of all time, and the peak of the Keaton's career. After a less-than-stellar sequel in 1992, he walked away and the remainder of his career hasn't ever reached that peak again, until now.\n\nThere is virtually no way that Keaton could brush off comparisons between his own career and that of the character that he plays in Birdman, a once great box office star of a hit superhero franchise who walked away from the series at its height but never really found that level of success again. As moviegoers, we love connectivity - we love seeing actors parallel their lives on the screen. We love to ask \"what if?\" What if Keaton had continued his role as The Caped Crusader under the direction of Joel Schumacher? Would he still be as beloved for the role of Batman if he had continued on?\n\nTo ask those questions is to wonder if Keaton himself ever considered this. Alas, we shall never know what might have become of the series and that question is what gives a movie like Birdman - or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, a bit of poignancy.\n\nIn what may be the comeback role of all time, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a once great box office superstar who starred in the blockbuster Birdman series 25 years ago but walked away from the series after three films, effectively giving up the fame and the money that went with it. Now, past 60, Riggan is the prime candidate for the \"Where Are They Now?\" files, a washed up actor who feels that he never really reached his potential. Yet, something is pulling him back - he misses the fame and notoriety that went with the role. It doesn't help that he continually hears the sinister, gravelly voice of Birdman in his head reminding him of this at every moment that his brain is idle.\n\nThe need to redeem himself and restore his career to a degree of respectability is what is causing Riggan to lose his marbles. In a last ditch effort at respectability, he has staked his reputation and all of his money on writing, directing and starring in a flouncy Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\"\n\nThe pace of Birdman is breathtaking as we watch the backstage preparation for a play that everyone believes is shaping up to be a disaster. Every conceivable disaster is laying on Riggan's shoulders. His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is now his personal assistant - and a reminder of his lousy parenting skills. There's the issue that Laura, his leading lady (Andrea Riseborough), may be pregnant with his child. Plus, there's the issue of Mike (Edward Norton), the self-involved leading man who is not only bedding one of the other cast members (Noami Watts), but is known to unexpectedly improvise.\n\nWhat could have been just a boring backstage farce, actually turns out to be one of the most entertaining movies to watch. Director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, usually known for dead serious dramas like Babel and 21 Grams takes a lighter touch here, creating a comedy that is funny not is jokes but in situation. We watch Riggan adrift in his own public image, whose most prolific moments have nothing to do with his work, like a video that goes viral after he accidentally locks himself out of his dressing room and ends up in the street in nothing but his underwear.\n\nBirdman kicks off as a dizzy backstage farce. Still in previews, Riggan's play is shaping up to be a colossal disaster. He may or may not have gotten his leading lady (Andrea Riseborough) pregnant, his estranged daughter (Emma Stone) has signed on as his personal assistant and is a constant reminder of what a bad father he was, and his newest cast member (an excellent Edward Norton) is a self-serious loose cannon who's sleeping with his insecure costar (Naomi Watts). I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the Mexican director of puzzle-piece melodramas such as Babel and 21 Grams, has a lighter, looser tone here, taking aim at the needy egos of theater folk and the craven carpetbagger mentality of Broadway today, where movie stars without stage training are leveraged to sell tickets. Goosing the satire to life is daredevil cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men), whose camera bobs and weaves amid the chaos in what looks like one long, breathless Steadicam shot.\n\nAs opening night approaches and the pressure on Riggan mounts, the taunting voice in his head grows louder until it's unclear what's real and what's imaginary. The film breaks with reality too, jackknifing into a trippy detour that audiences will either go with or not. For me, there was never any question. I was so all-in on Keaton's vanity-free, go-for-broke metamorphosis I would have followed him, or the movie, anywhere. Which is pretty much where it asks you to go. Birdman is a scalpel-sharp dissection of Hollywood, Broadway, and fame in the 21st century. But more than that, it's a testament to Keaton's enduring charisma and power as an actor. He soars.",

            "content": "Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu arrives with his latest film, which partly acts as a satire on the current state that films are in with big, loud box office projects from various directors, while bringing it home to a time of more character driven, smaller films.\n\nThis film focuses on a washed up actor, Riggan Thomson, who is well known for playing the superhero Birdman in several films. He plans on restarting his career by mounting the play What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, written by Raymond Carver. He has not only written it, but is also directing and starring in it. After a light fixture falls during rehearsal onto one of the co-stars, Riggan is forced to bring in method actor Mike Shiner to replace the actor, while Shiner attempts to steal the spotlight from Riggan at times.\n\nThe film is a ground breaking achievement, which perfectly pokes fun at the current state of Hollywood and how films are being approached as big, loud box office films.\n\nThe cast is terrific, in particular Michael Keaton. Keaton brings a real sense of disaster to the role of Riggan, who is at his breaking point, attempting to get the play on Broadway successfully, but also trying to rejuvenate his career. Like his character, Keaton is also well-known for depicting a superhero on screen: Batman, in the two Tim Burton directed films, Batman and Batman Returns. This further allows Keaton to be relatable to the character, while it also seems to help him bring a sense of realism at times to his role. Emma Stone does a great job as Riggan's daughter, a recovering drug addict who takes on the role of assistant on her father's play. Stone is fantastic, working well with Keaton and Edward Norton in several scenes. Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough are also perfect as actresses appearing in the play, as is Amy Ryan as Riggan's former wife. Lindsay Duncan puts forth a cold performance as an antagonistic theatre critic, while Zach Galifianakis puts forth a break out performance as Riggan's lawyer, in his first dramatic performance. The other real standout in the film, next to Keaton, is Edward Norton, who plays the volatile method actor Mike Shiner. Norton is outstanding, going to the limit, at times stealing scenes and even in a few putting forth a comedic tone, such as in a notable scene where he and Naomi Watts emerge from a bed, Norton with a large erection, which is not only unexpected, but also comical. The character is partly similar to Norton, who like Norton, is difficult to work with, even going to extremes to get his performance right. Like with Keaton, this helps Norton brings a sense of realism and grit to his performance.\n\nAs usual Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is flawless, very beautiful. Here, the entire film is presented as one long take, which required up to fifteen to twenty minutes of a scene to be filmed in one take. While the film wasn't shot as one long take, the shooting structure, constant rehearsing and editing techniques help it appear like a single long take, which is not only flawless, but also supports the film. Throughout the entire film, it never feels like a gimmick, it really does support it, while it is also something to be admired.\n\nThe drum score, by Antonio Sanchez, is also remarkable, at times unsettling, but also at times calm, bring a great sense of jazz to the entire film. The score supports many of the characters, their actions and the plot.\n\nThe end result is a film that perfectly honors character driven, small films, while also honoring at times the golden days of filmmaking. It also acts as a wonderful, satirical thesis on the matter that most of these big, dull, senseless, loud box office films have taken over audiences (for example those by Michael Bay) and have started to overshadow the more well thought out, character driven films that don't always need to rely on senseless, loud action with no clear plot in mind.\n\nWhen the film ends, you feel like you have seen not only a great film, but a film by a true genius.",

            "content": "Of note in this dark dramatized tale of a fictitious actor's aging career are the dynamic scenes between Norton and Keaton. Whenever they grace the stage (and the screen) we find evidence of two Hollywood veterans upping their game. Particularly in the case of Keaton, this is a return to form that sets up his best film in a while. \n\nThere is more than a bit of tongue in cheek that is hard not to assume in much of the films portrayal of Keaton. As the character of Riggan, he plays an actor who is best known for playing a famed superhero (Birdman), but as he ages he finds himself struggling to move past this persona and to give himself to project that could define his legacy as a bonafide actor. In this we are brought face to face with some of the demons from his past, including failures as a father, a fading career, obsessive compulsions, and a struggling rehabilitation. It is this struggle for identity, an exercise of self exploration and the importance of our accomplishments in such a wide and vast world as ours (as an actor, a father, a human being) that forms the heart of the film. \n\nThe film takes makes some creative choices that play with our perception, including the illusion of being filmed in one continuous shot, and some understated effects that allow us to play along with the voices in his head (including an opening sequence where Keaton is levitating in mid air and moving objects at will). It is meant to have the viewer operating on a number of different levels as we connect with the reality of the character's circumstance, moving from the broken mind of Keaton to the supporting characters around him, and then ultimately as the audience. It's a neat trick in terms of the directing choices, and although it does get a bit odd in places, the creativity adds to the allure of the story. \n\nThe story itself is fused with a bit of shakespearean undertones, fluxuating between a tragedy and a comedy that fuses with some modern realism and fantastical elements. In this sense it is hard to pin down. It is unique in many ways, although also familiar. Given that much of the film takes place on the stage (the avenue of choice for Keaton's character to revitalize his career), the film also retains something of that stage presence on screen. It moves us from moments that remind us we are watching a film, to sequences that feel like a dramatized stage production. Again, this provides a unique viewing experience, even as we are forced to bring our head around to the style itself. The relationships move and flow at different paces as they intersect with Riggan's world, one in which his failures as a father meet up with his failures as a husband and lover, actor and stage manager. They all reveal the sheer amount of weight that he carries on his shoulders, while also bringing importance to the supporting characters themselves. \n\nOf note as well is the perfect casting for Emma Stone as Keaton's daughter, and a very restrained performance by Zach G.. All around the supporting cast is very good.",

Unfortunately, the script often fails. The plot and dialog struck me as absurd - as if the actors are always on stage. But perhaps that is the point? Is this a slap at the ego of the typical actor?  I don't know, but I do know I found myself thinking it was a bit much at times. In particular the character and acting of Edward Norton.

            "content": "On Oscars night 2014, there was a hullabaloo about Birdman winning best picture. I cheered, without having seen the movie, because it felt like the right pick, what with the renewal of Michael Keaton, a Spanish director Innaritu, it felt like the right socially conscious pick. Plus the commercials made the film seem really bad@ss, so I couldn't see how it could possibly be bad. FFWD a year or more and I have finally watched this movie. It started off well enough with some interesting camera movements and a disturbed Michael Keaton floating in the air. How could it fail? The problem for me was the ending. I kept waiting for that payoff, about what Birdman symbolically was and how this story was important for me to watch.\n\n It's hard to underestimate the importance of a good ending, it ties everything together and makes the perfect symbol for the audience to understand. What is the moral of the story? And with Birdman, that moral was seemingly nil. I have long grown unaccepting of Hollywood's pale use of suicide as a trope for a main character to feel any kind of sorrow. I don't know what has happened with Hollywood that characters now have to give up in order for us empathize with them. There is no spirit of the undying, just 'moop, I give up'. Very short, curt and to the point, I guess.\n\nBut why? Suicide should only be used as the ultimate expression of frustration. But with movies like The Artist and Birdman, we make extreme light of this act in a cartoony, funny sort of way--and it doesn't need that, it doesn't allow that. No one laughed the day comedy died, the day Robin Williams left us. Suicide is something completely ununderstandable, and it will stay that way. A movie trying to explain it in such pale terms should be looked down upon. \n\nI'm afraid Hollywood is guilty of not caring enough. They selected this movie probably because they felt it looked nice, even if its narrative makes little sense, and a lot of the acting performances are utterly wasted. Birdman was a callous oscars win, it showed that rich people have about as much care in them as porcelain dolls.",

            "content": "2015's best picture didn't generate much in box office returns, but it did create a lot of buzz among indie film fans. At the center of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's 'Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' is a conflicted man - a former leading actor named Riggan who has fallen from grace and turns to directing and starring in an obscure show on Broadway in an attempt to make himself relevant again. Michael Keaton delivers a standout performance, as he's beyond believable in a semi-psychotic role and really digs down deep to bring the crazy and translate it in a way to make the audience feel a sliver of sympathy for the character formerly known as Birdman.\n\nOne of 'Birdman's strengths is the craftsmanship that went into the camerawork. There are a number of scenes in the film that are shot in one take, with a single camera. This is an impressive technique no matter what, but it adds to the zaniness that transpires onscreen. There's also plenty of creative editing that is used throughout, and the special effects that correspond with Riggan's hallucinations.\n\nWhile the concept and execution are really cool on the surface, 'Birdman' is not without its flaws. For one, some of the character backstories are sacrificed for cheap dialogue. True, there are some interesting relationships explored, like the one between the daughter of the Birdman (Emma Stone) and a slightly more famous actor who is brought in last-minute to help the play survive previews (Edward Norton), but these seem to muddy the water even further and do not help much. Still, there are characters who are included only for the sake of making Riggan out to be batty, including a smug, prickly 'New York Times' reviewer named Tabitha who helps bring out the true frustration within Riggan. Zach Galifianakis surprisingly plays one of the most sane characters in the entire film.\n\n'Birdman' definitely has its fair share of fans, but it's a little too narrowly focused to have major appeal, even with its Academy Award victory.",

The acting is good, although it is not a stretch or challenge for the actors featured as they all portray someone similar to themselves.  The very cool part is that the whole film was shot with very minimal cuts. meaning some scenes last 20 minutes without cutting away or switching cameras.  That keeps it flowing but also is so different that at times makes it a negative.  The plot seemed very straight forward but at times it got really weird with super-powers and flying and it just seemed out of place in the otherwise normal film.

For starters, Michael Keaton and Emma Stone are fantastic, with Keaton being the absolute best that he's been in years. I've read a lot of praise for Edward Norton, but I didn't really see all too much that stood out from his usual performances. On the technical side of things, the long takes are quite impressive. Getting these scenes to play out properly couldn't have been an easy task, but they play out smoothly. Story wise, there really isn't much here besides Keaton's redemption, and even that gets rushed towards the end. The film just seems to plod along and bounce from side plot to side plot. The pacing is also another issue, despite being a decent two hours, the first half of the film feels like it drags on.

Keaton's personal battle with family, friends and trying to resurrect what his career was also quite interesting. Birdman is filled with excellent scenes and performances as well.

Birdman overall really is a movie fanatic fantasy, but at the same time is somewhat of a difficult movie to enjoy.

In a bid to make a comeback, he struggles to mount a Broadway play which he has written and directed. In the days leading up to opening night, he battles with his lunatic Method actor co-star, played to flamboyant perfection by Edward Norton, who earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor here, and his obstinate daughter, marvelously played by Emma Stone, who recieved an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and the persistent presence of his \"Birdman\" alter ego, which at moments throughout the film suggest that he may be losing his grip on reality. Masterful direction by Inarritu, with superlative supporting performances by Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Jeremy Shamos, and Andrea Riseborough, but its Michael Keaton's towering turn that totally dominates this howlingly funny motion picture. There is an extraordinary script by Inarritu, Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Amando Bo, and stunning cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. Antonio Sanchez' musical score is terrific. A phenomenal cinematic triumphant, and one of the year's finest films. Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Best Original Screenplay: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Best Cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki.

            "content": "Whereas Boyhood was monumental in that it took risks in the fact that it was shot over 12 years, Birdman is monumental in that the film is essentially supposed to feel like it is all done in one long take (aside from the beginning and ending of the film).\n\nThere are many great aspects of this film, the first being the amazing cast of actors. Michael Keaton leads this cast with an incredible performance, having to show different personalities through his Birdman persona as well as the washed up Riggan, who is very passionate about the performing arts to say the least. I have not seen The Theory of Everything, so I cannot call Redmayne's win for best leading actor a snub, but I can say that Keaton was at his best and I am glad he was considered for the Oscar.\n\nMy favorite performance of the film, however, comes from Edward Norton, and this might be my 2nd favorite performance of the year behind J.K. Simmons in Whiplash. Norton is this superhero of an actor, Mike, who is so devoted to realism that he drinks actual gin to get the feel of an era, or that he \"gets hard\" as he delves into a sexual experience his character is having. It is particularly fun to watch him give suggestions to and act in front of Riggan to show true artistry - Norton's acting within acting is right on the money.\n\nAs for the visuals of this film, A+. Amazing concept to do a film in one long take (what is supposed to feel like one take) especially when this take requires moving the camera all over the place around this theatre setting.\n\nHowever, this film does seem overly repetitive at points, striking home the idea that we're not living as we are meant to live. This comes from lines such as \"stop looking through your phones and actually experience something\" and various \"rants.\" While I am a big fan of monologues, this film seems a little monologue-heavy in order to get its philosophy across. Emma stone rants about how Riggan wants significance in his life though he is not important; Riggan rants to the critic that she doesn't truly understand meaning (or significance); Norton rants that you have to delve into literature - in this case plays - to find their significance; you see the pattern, right?\n\nI like the ambiguity of the ending, but it could have ended stronger in a different spot. This different spot I refer to made my heart race so much during my first viewing of the film. I will not spoil the last shot of the film, but I like that though it does not give a clear explanation of its final shot, Birdman meshes the realistic with the unrealistic, just how Riggan has been in and out of the unreality of the play he is putting on throughout the movie.\n\nI highly recommend this film; a great drama that contains a lot of smart comedy.",

            "content": "Review:\nI really had high hopes for this movie because it done so well at the box office and most of the critics gave it a great write up but now that I have watched it, I feel quite disappointed. I was able to stay away from the spoilers so I didn't know that the film was set around the theatre, which I found quite boring after a while. Anyway, the movie is about a actor who became famous by playing the role as Birdman but once he stops playing the capped superhero, the work dries up and he struggles to hit the spotlight again. He then finances a Broadway play and his career and reputation rides on the play becoming a success. Whilst preparing for the opening night, his relationship with his daughter (Stone), his ex-wife (Amy Ryan), the leading actor (Norton), his pregnant girlfriend (Riseborough) and his annoying alter ego (Birdman), all play a part in making Riggan Thomson (Keaton) lose his mind, especially with a critic on his back who threatens to shut his play down. By the time that he hits the stage, the pressure really takes its toll and he takes drastic measures to finally find some peace. The storyline is original and I couldn't believe how long one shot was. The acting is superb from Keaton and the rest of the cast but I still wasn't that impressed with the concept or the direction that the movie took. I kept on waiting for something amazing to happen but it felt like a dull drama about a depressed man. I liked when his alter ego came into play, with the explosions and the massive dinosaur and I also liked the chemistry between Keaton & Norton but it did get a bit messy after a while because there was way too much going on. That's not too say that it's not a cleverly made film but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nMichael Keaton is another actor who I enjoy watching since Mr. Mom, Gung Ho, Beetlejuice, Clean & Sober, the Dream Team and Nightshift in the 80's. I liked him as Batman but the movies were crap and they really damaged his career. There are a few innuendos in this film which make it look like his alter ego was geared towards Batman but thats not on the record. He has played a part in Robocop, Need For Speed, Minions and the Other Guys but he didn't play a major role. Personally, I think he's a great actor but he has just made a lot of bad choices like Herbie Fully Loaded and Post Grad. I really couldn't see this role played by anyone else and this movie definitely wouldn't be as big as it was without Keaton in the lead. Its just a shame that he lost out at the Oscars to Eddie Redmayne. Anyway, the film was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who is currently directing the Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy and hes made Babel, 21 Grams and Biutiful. He does have a unique style of directing, which must have been hard to achieve in this movie because the takes were extremely long. I liked the fact that he let Keaton let loose in this movie because it really pushed him to the max and Norton also showed a different side to his acting skills. Anyway, this is a well made film which made a healthy profit at the box office but I was hoping for a bit more.\n\nBudget: $18million\nWorldwide Gross: $103million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their deep dramas about an has been actor who is performing and financing a play to bring him back into the spotlight. 5/10",

In other words, see it once, say, \"Oh that was interesting,\" and never think about it again. \n\nThe script is awful. It's the real life equivalent of a widowed elderly woman's cat's shit. But not like normal cat shit. Its like the cat shit of a cat that is fed bottled water and hand prepared meals by someone who has nothing else better to do but pamper an animal as their sad life wastes away. Get the point? No? That means its pretentious, full of itself, predictable, and utterly sad that it's respected. \n\nWhen I imagine how this film won the Academy Award for best film, I picture a bunch of ol chaps standing around a fire in a mansion in Tuxedos. One man says \"M'yes this film is about us! Let us vote for it!\" Another man then suggests they fart and smell each others asses. This film is so far up its own ass its actually came out of its own mouth and went into another pretentious douche bags ass hole. \n\nI hate films that are artsy for the sake of being artsy. Its like that awkward person you knew in college who tries really hard to be different yet lists \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"American Idol\" as their favorite TV shows. If I haven't beaten the dead horse enough ill just straight up tell you, I hate this script. \n\nMoving on, I didn't particularly feel much towards Michael Keaton's performance. I thought it was relatively bland and predictable. I found myself wanting him to fail and everything to fall apart around him. I actually was rooting for him to kill himself. Literally I was watching the movie and thinking \"JUST JUMP ALREADY!\" \n\nEmma Stone accepted a shit part that she shouldn't have. That predictable Hollywood child who has been to rehab, smokes pot, and wants to sleep with the guy that drives her dad crazy. Woopidy fucking doo.\n\nThe only acting bright spot was Edward Norton. And that's probably only because I really like Edward Norton. Norton plays the difficult actor Mike Shiner very well and his boner scene was the only time I laughed in the film. Literally, the best part of this movie is a boner scene. \n\nThe cinematography was notable and the film was shot to look like a continuous shot. Something people are saying was \"innovative\" and never done before. Yes it has, Hitchcock's Rope comes to mind. Except that film was good and was real art.  \n\nThen there's the whole predictable critic who doesn't like it because he's a Hollywood actor. She wants to destroy him. She's right. This isn't freaking art. It's someone trying to be artsy. And she also reminds me why I hate critics from major markets. Their heads have disappeared up their own ass so far they think things are good that aren't. That actually describes the critic's positive reviews of this film pretty well. They are wrong.

            "content": "Ambiguity. Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is rife with it. Take its title for instance; it is literally impossible to come to a conclusion regarding its purpose as it either misleads or baffles. Birdman retains the danger of either getting it right by emphasising the richness of its material or simply confusing you with its inability to provide complete clarity. Birdman offers a plot so hard to explain in a few sentences for there is so many avenues the plot attacks with ingenuity building a layered story filled with tonnes of critical entertainment. Birdman tells the tale of Riggan Thomson, a washed up Hollywood actor famous for his role as the superhero Birdman, struggling to mount a Broadway adaptation of writer Raymond Carver\u00e2??s \u00e2??What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\u00e2?? Riggan is tormented by the voice of Birdman who criticises his career downturn whilst also imagining himself performing psychological feats, which embodies him as the ultimate unreliable protagonist. Using a piece of literature to instigate his career rejuvenation, Riggan must overcome the voice in his head, the pressures of performing and his own unattainable expectations in order to escape his life crisis indefinitely.\n \nEx-Batman crusader Michael Keaton stars as the protagonist Riggan Thomson and this performance has injected, like his character sorely seeks, a career stimulation as he has popped out of nowhere with some stellar acting. Especially in the second half of the film where the spotlight increasingly focuses on Riggan, Keaton delves completely into the role pinning it down for us all to commend. Edward Norton\u00e2??s portrayal of Mike Shiner, the popular Broadway actor cast in a supporting role brings out the best in Riggan as they furiously yet intimately interchange words with one another on a number of times. If the second half of the film is Keaton\u00e2??s, Norton absolutely steals the opening as he bursts onto the screen with a pizzazz that attracts you further in. Emma Stone stars as Riggan\u00e2??s daughter Sam and on occasions she really steals the show as she imposes herself with a mixture of a damaged fa\u00c3\u00a7ade wrapped up in a commanding aura. Stone is one of the brightest actors of the new generation and at 26, Birdman will change her career, especially that she is now an Oscar nominee now! Naomi Watts stars as Lesley, Mike\u00e2??s girlfriend and an actress in the production. Zach Galifianakis, with a minor yet impactful performance, portrays Jake, Riggan\u00e2??s lawyer, friend and producer of the show. For those of you that don\u00e2??t know Galifianakis, he is Alan from The Hangover and considering there has not been a film of him portraying someone other than a total idiot, his performance in Birdman is a shock to witness. With Keaton, Norton and Stone nominated for Oscars, Birdman is a talented acting fest.\n \nRiggan believes himself he is Birdman and tries to convince us that he is who he says he is, but such unrealism is not possible and therefore everything you see must be questioned. There are simple ways to prove that he isn\u00e2??t an actual superhero with superpowers but the ending leaves you sitting on the fence hoping his belief in himself is real. The problem is that we never get to know! It is frustrating because there is never complete transparency and at the end when you want a resolution, more ambiguity arrives. Riggan is a tormented soul that you want to believe can defeat his demons and become who he wants to be but you struggle to remain convinced that he can do it. He is an unreliable protagonist as his desires transgress the boundaries of believability and transpire on the screen as his truth so you must never believe what you see until the passage of clarity arrives\u00e2?\u00a6 but wait, it never actually does, so Birdman is right down to its core an ambiguous character study. These films stay with you long after you\u00e2??ve left the cinema for their lack of closure that leaves you imagining what could have been, but their irritation factor is sky high because closure is the best form of satisfaction nowadays\u00e2?\u00a6 hopefully there is no Birdman 2!\n \nThe technical marvel that is Birdman is evident as the film is made to look like one big long take. Scenes never cut to show the hours and days changing, instead opposing scenes are morphed together so brilliantly that as a character travels into a new location, time changes along the way. It really is amazing to witness, as it never loses your focus, as it doesn\u00e2??t let you lose connection with the proceedings. 2 hours will fly past and you will have experienced a layered story that functions as one big block in a man\u00e2??s short-term life. The personal shortcomings of Riggan provide a basis for his possibly false mental capacity to dominate the technical side to filmmaking. His abilities range from levitation to telekinesis but it appears in the most peculiar of surroundings, a theatre; a place of entertainment that for actors is the paramount podium of realism. Such a juxtaposition of fiction and realism could be seen as a trying to give audiences the best of both worlds, but instead it opens up another avenue to layer this already layered world with social criticism.\n \nBirdman is a critical study of society and its growing divide between people on the same social wavelength and people who are out of touch with how to satisfy or feel satisfied by society. The story essentially revolves around a man\u00e2??s inability to attract the same success he had in the past because of how much he is out of touch with the present. This highlights the prevalent problem with the youth of today as only the spectacular, brainless form of entertainment can be the only form of pleasure people receive as everything else is out of touch, past it sell by date or just simply has too much talking. Forms of entertainment such as theatre or books with rich history and imaginative entertainment are ignored and overlooked in favour of 6-second instant entertainment in the form of Vine\u00e2??s and social media that provide no form of enrichment, merely short-term pleasure. Birdman highlights the fact that the only way to be great in today\u00e2??s society is if your connected to social platforms that notice you for your new form of extremity, not talent. A scene that springs to mind in particularly is when the Stone argues with Riggan stating he is out of touch with society because he doesn\u00e2??t \u00e2??even have a Facebook page!\u00e2?? It appears social media is a necessity and a good old-fashioned piece of literature transported to the stage cannot be loved globally because someone\u00e2??s head isn\u00e2??t being shot off or helicopter\u00e2??s aren\u00e2??t crashing\u00e2?\u00a6 well, they may be but Birdman isn\u00e2??t relying on them for entertainment, but instead using it is as clout to their critical study of being in touch with society.\n \nLike The Grand Budapest Hotel, Birdman has been nominated 9 times at the Oscars. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a flawless piece of art and should be the Best Picture winner but I wouldn\u00e2??t be inconsolable if Birdman won as it has a quirky originality to itself that Budapest has in abundance. For a film of 119 minutes, Birdman is a feast of a film that provides a banquet of original moviemaking entertainment in a short space of time.\n\nBirdman provides tonnes to be entertained from, critical of and mesmerised at as a result of its resonant script and intense acting.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??     9/10",

Riggan was under such emotional strain in both his personal and professional lives that the issue appeared to manifest in to severe mental illness:  the voice of Birdman taunting him and mocking him; the hallucinations of his ability to levitate and move objects; hallucinations of Birdman appearing before him.  This is what probably led Riggan to shoot his nose off while on stage in the final act.  (Was it a failed suicide attempt?  An attempt to act out the drama of his failed marriage after having a relevant discussion with his ex-wife minutes before?)  Riggan then commits suicide by jumping out of the window of a hospital when Birdman's presence persisted to plague him as did the unhappiness in his life, in spite of the success of the Broadway play.   It seems so paradoxical that a huge success on Broadway, which was hard fought and which Riggan shared with the other actors, resulted in such a morbid ending.  Did Riggan not prove himself to be a great actor and not merely a celebrity arising from the remnants of Birdman?   \n\nDoes irony make good movies?  The tone and ending of Birdman reminds me of Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream. The parts that illustrate psychological breakdown are similar to Black Swan.",

It took a second viewing for me to really get a good grip of the film as a whole as well as appreciate its dialogue and execution but man, this really makes one hell of an all time favorite classic! And what really hits it home for me is that THEY JUST WENT FOR IT! I mean, in everything! Not just the stunning and unique and original way they shot the film, but in the clever commentary, in the parodies, in the surprisingly real and at times hilarious dialogue, in the artsy psychology of the main character, in the crazy scenes (Michael Keaton vs Edward Norton fight, A LESBIAN KISSING SCENE), in the score (which is just drums), everything! It's the kind of film that you can't appreciate in just one or two watches, because this film really is a lot deeper in many ways, and not in the typical way art films are but in a very refreshing, more real way.\nAnd you see, this kind of film wouldn't have worked at all if everything wasn't done to near perfection (I mean, just imagine seeing the script of this along with all the ideas for how it should be executed annotated along the side - CRAZY!). The acting is unbelievably great, not just from Michael Keaton (who, btw, the film's main character is parodying - in case you are not familiar with the guy - in not only how he hasn't really been in anything since 1992, but he last played BATMAN, which is very comparable to the film's main character and Birdman), but the whole cast, all-round, and I was especially surprised by Emma Stone. I already had a good opinion of her as an actress before the film, but she raised the bar for herself! The scene where she just rants out at her father had my jaw drop to the floor, and this is a very different role for her compared to other films that she's been in, and she does it so well.\nNow some people talk about how they don't get the plot, and really, this isn't that kind of movie! This is a movie where the dialogue dominates, and not a twisty-turny plot. Aside from the rants of the characters that has got the film critics saying this film is social commentary and what-not, there are a lot of moments that were surprisingly hilarious. And that's really what sets this film apart from other artistic films - aside from the actual deep real things it has to say about life and fame and film, it has a great humor to it.\nAnd just like everything I already mentioned, the characters are also not so straightforward and deep. The character Edward Norton plays, while a jerk, if you listen to what he says, he actually says the truth, and it reminds me of so many of my favorite characters, like House, Sherlock Holmes, just to name the most well-known. The character of Michael Keaton, though to different degrees, really represents pretty much everyone with a dream/failed dream/past-his/her-time, and if you think through what he's going through, you can find what he's struggled through in the movie in yourself, and that just makes the film even grander for me, because that makes me reflect on my life and how I chase my dreams.\nI could go on and on and to the reader who has stuck to this point in my review, I wish I could just watch the movie with you next to me so that I could point out all the awesome things this movie has with it, but alas.",

Avatar, Social Network, Descendants, Django Unchained, Gravity and Boyhood in a perfect world you would have won but sadly we have to deal with The Hurt Locker (ugh), The King's Speech, The Artist, Argo (ugh), 12 Years a Slave and Now Birdman.  if you look at the common pattern of the movies listed, 3 are about perseverance, 3 are about Americans, and more importantly (especially in the more recent years) 3 are about the arts.  And that is why Birdman won.  Don't get wrong, out of the bunch listed, Birdman is probably the best winner in years, I just don't think it's my favorite movie of the year.  What makes Birdman a good movie is how it almost plays out like a play in a play. Like 30 Rock.  Everything from the weird lively soundtrack is awesome.  The \"one shot\" approach is kind of cheesy at times but works well I feel.  The satire on America, the need for \"blockbusters\" and no one wants \"the moody films\" is so spot on it makes you wonder why this movie is so interesting in being that way against the dreck of summer 2014 of Marvel.  Still, Birdman I don't feel follows to it's promise.  It doesn't amount to anything substantial (you could argue Boyhood didn't either, but I feel a much more emotional connection to that film).  The acting is ok, if quirky, nothing really gets resolved and maybe that's the point.  I think the movie is more for the interest if you like the arts versus to watch as a \"good\" movie.",

Academy members, especially the actor's branch, are bound to love it, and audiences will as well.\n\n Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, director of Oscar nominated downers like 21 Grams and Best Picture 2006 contender Babel - two films I loved - achieves a masterpiece with his latest creation. Inarritu is in Robert Altman territory here making mock of Hollywood avarice and actor's neuroses. And he gives Michael Keaton the comeback performance he so richly deserves. Keaton is phenomenal as Riggin Thomas, tortured by his professional and personal past and present: a broken marriage, failure as a parent, career suicide and financial calamity. And now as he sinks his life savings into a play, he has to deal with Edward Norton, a pretentious Broadway star who never sold out to play a super-hero and wants to get busy with Riggan's daughter played by Emma Stone. Stone is the best she's ever been, leaving her usual light-hearted effervescence behind to play the cold, betrayed Sam. Norton is on fire, the best he's been in a decade. Truly Birdman is an acting tour de force from the whole cast.\n\n The script by a cadre of Inarritu teammates, some of whom worked on his 2010 Best Foreign Language Film nominee Biutiful - have carved out the best script of its kind since Shakespeare in Love. Gutsy to stick Hollywood's own success in its face and bemoan the loss of art to commerce. We here lines like \"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige\" and \"People, they love blood, they love action. Not this talky, depressing, philosophical bullshit.\" And the jabs at the likes of Michael Fassbender, Robert Downey Jr. and all the current caped crusaders are fast and furious.\n\n I have to admit I love the blood and the action AND the depressing, philosophical bullshit too. I saw Interstellar and Birdman in the same weekend - two films at creative odds with each other - and experienced two of the very best films of the year. So there is a reason to love Hollywood and art after all. Birdman will be an across the board Oscar contender this year. Not to be missed.",

He adapts a Raymond Carver novel into a play and directs and stars in it on Broadway.  The movie shows the roller-coaster ride that is his mind, plus the behind-the-scenes goings on of the play.\n\nCertainly not your average movie.  The blurring of the lines between reality and fantasy, as the lead character veers constantly between delusion and actuality, is incredibly intriguing and not a little disconcerting (and this is not necessarily a bad thing).  \n\nThe plot is simultaneously simple and complex - simple main structure but very complex in the intricacies.  Ultimately it is a character-driven movie, and the characters are well-developed and complex.\n\nOn that note, it is not all about Riggan.  There are some sub-plots involving his daughter, Sam (played by Emma Stone) plus other cast members.  These non-Riggan moments provide for respite from the intensity of Riggan and his issues, and are a welcome relief.\n\nWhile it is the script and direction that set up the movie, it is the performances that complete it - casting is spot-on and the cast act of their skins.  \n\nSuperb performance by Michael Keaton in the lead role - he well deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination.  Good support from Emma Stone, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan.  Stone and Norton are excellent and got Supporting Actress/Actor Oscar nominations.\n\nEven Zach Galifianakis, better known as a comedy actor, is solid in his role.  \n\nThis movie well deserved its 2015 Best Picture Oscar.",

Inarritu has got to be one of the most insane directors breathing for several reasons--reasons that all spawn from Birdman. The technical decision to shoot the entire film in one continuous shot (though there are hidden, seamless cuts, i.e., about two or three) and the decision in the narrative to tell a satirical message mocking specific people who maybe even saw the movie. To me, there seems to be two fundamental messages in Birdman and tantamount to the movie's comedy-drama genre, Birdman has both a satirical (comedic) message and a serious (dramatic) message. The later I won't talk about, but the former (the bold one) I will. To quote Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), \"Stop living your life through your phone screens people!\" I might be paraphrasing there, but the mocking, satirical message that this line conveys is that the majority of our generation of moviegoers are those who watch movies like a juvenile, dim-witted kid. Those who come to see movies and not be challenged intellectually in the slightest, but to 'ahh' at an explosion and dose off when those stupid characters start talking again. Birdman is supposedly Riggan Thomson's (Michael Keaton) subconscious and is constantly conflicting with him and telling him, \"People don't care about this philosophical bull-crap.\" Again, paraphrasing, but this message Birdman conveys is perfectly contemporary for our generation of Hollywood movies. Because of how contemporary this is, it almost feels like Birdman breaks the 4th wall (which it actually does with Antonio Sanchez's all-drum score). In fact, Birdman almost breaks the 4th wall many times. For instance, there are pop culture references to the Avengers many times. That is why this message works because, as the dialogue mocks, the theme of the movie mocks. Again, Inarritu is very bold in his decisions, but the movie required his boldness if he was going to tell a message as insane as previously discussed.",

Secondly, the characterization, it's not just the personality of each character, but also the in-depth look of each other's life. You noticed, how good they are in this film. Michael Keaton (Riggan) as the protagonist, he is seriously impressive here. He's having this wild imagination with an imaginary friend like he is bothered nor struggled at times, and he wants to prove, he's not just a celebrity, but a stage actor. He wants to prove how he's good at it. Edward Norton as Mike, he is more of an asshole, like he does that for the better. I really dig Emma Stone's performance in here, and she feels for it. And special mention to Zack. I mean, I never though he can do one of these roles. He is a smart-assy type of lawyer and he's good at it. This is a well scripted, and with brilliant performances. It tells how us, not just the actors, but the everyday people. How do we handle the pressure like these. The sense of urgency. By not being mentally incompetent about anything. But to love about what have. Be passionate. 4.5/5",

            "content": "One of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. The basic premise of the movie is that Michael Keaton is a washed-up superhero movie star from the '90s who is directing and acting in a Broadway play in order to become relevant again. Oddly enough, he seems to actually have some kind of telekinetic and levitation powers, though whether these are real or a figment of his delusions is left for the audience to figure out. Emma Stone does a decent job as his daughter, and Ed Norton is his usual tempestuous self. There's a bunch of modern bits of nonsense tacked on in the form of Twitter and \"going viral\" and so forth, and it wouldn't be a movie from the 2010s without some random lesbian action going on to satisfy our current day version of the token minority. I did like how there were no cuts at all in the movie; it's all done with one camera that follows everyone around, kind of like Cloverfield but without the shakiness. The story itself is alright, and has something to say about modern culture and the divide between movie and stage acting, but this is weighed down by the bizarre new-age fantasy segments of Michael Keaton flying around and generally going insane. Overall, it's hard to understand why this won Best Picture at the Oscars, but I guess if you're into indie film techniques and barebones social commentary, this is the one for you.",

            "content": "Sometimes the gangster life is unavoidable in business, no matter how hard one tries to avoid it and keep going on a straight and narrow pace. Whether one wants to admit it or not, you have to get your hands dirty every once in a while. A Most Violent Year goes over those tough life and death decisions with aplomb with an engrossing character study of a business man who does all he can to not play dirty when things get tough. \nSet in the winter of 1981, New York City is statistically experiencing the most violent year in the city's history. Crime is rampant and everyone is looking to get their piece of the pie in search of that elusive American dream. Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is a Latino immigrant who is a self-made man who worked up from a driver at an oil company to be the boss of the operation. He is quickly rising up the ranks in the oil business and is about to become bigger when he makes a deal for riverside property that would grow his business exponentially and give him a stranglehold on the market. Aided by his trustful lawyer Andrew Walsh (Albert Brooks), He seeks to do business legally and won't resort to tactics that threaten his workers or himself. Things seem to be going well but troubles arise when competing oil companies stick up his drivers and steal his product and persistent DA Lawrence (David Oyelowo) is breathing down his neck for numerous illegal business practices that threaten to derail his life as well as business. To further add to his conflict is his wife Anna (Jessica Chastain), the daughter of a gangster who Abel bought the business from, who tasks him in taking a more take charge attitude and bite back. With so much added pressure, he rushes to clear the deal and take his business to the next level.\nThis isn't your average or regular gangster drama, which may upset some but I found it to be enthralling and captivating with a couple of great performances. Isaac is one of the standouts and adds another dynamic role to his already impressive resume. Taking hints from a past gangster like Michael Corleone in The Godfather, not only in character but slicked back hair and some gorgeous coats, he is thrown into the world of crime and is unsure how to react. Michael eventually becomes a cold blooded kingpin of the criminal underworld while it's a more virtuous journey for Abel who wants to hold onto his code of honor and duty. Seeing him wade through the waters of good and evil is an entertaining exploit to what man will do to ensure the safety of his business and family. \nYou become invested in what happens to him and what he is willing to do to make sure that he won't get pushed around anymore by those that deem him weak. Isaac has a quiet and serious mentality that is often set in stone but will diminish if the pressure is put on him. He exudes a cool confidence and an imposing front that would feel right at home in a violent gangster epic by Scorsese but in a cut throat business of heating oil, it still feels right at home. The change in background doesn't make the world any less thrilling or entertaining. If Isaac doesn't take at least one serious gangster film, I would be incredibly surprised. He has a great presence and control over his character that you could potentially see him blow up at any moment. There is much intensity in his eyes that you could practically see his blood boiling, leaving you waiting if he will give in to his violent urges. \nTough and rough edged, he doesn't take things lying down, even if it never resorts to violence, and he eventually takes matters into his own hands when he won't put up with his product getting stolen any longer. But he is by no means innocent as he has been doing the same duplicitous business dealings as his competitors have done but not in a way of outright stealing from one another and threating workers lives. Doing so, it makes an interesting dynamic where you root for him somewhat while at the same time see that he was never all the way clean to begin with. Making up his better half is Chastain's amazing performance as the dutiful gangster's daughter but not necessarily the gangster's wife. She is very well connected with her family being key members of the criminal underworld that clearly influenced her character and how she does business. \nAbel wanting to do business his way stops her the moment she mentions her notorious family to offer him some much needed help. Whip smart and in control, she is in charge of the books for the company and proves to be incredibly valuable later on. She practically steals every scene she is in and commandeers the ship or attempts to when things get out of hand. Chastain made it very easy to be enthralled by her as she attempts to woo Abel to the dark side of business and give in to his inner gangster. She has an impressive presence that makes the complete image of her rather appealing. Her beauty matched with her no nonsense ideals makes for an amazing character that no one would dare mess with. She simply talks the talk and walks the walk, daring anybody else to stand toe to toe with her. This makes the chemistry between Isaac and Chastain crackling with tension and emotion where you can't help but stick onto every word. \nThe repoire they show was incredibly engaging, with neither one willing to let up it made for some great drama and interactions. Brooks was good too in a small but important role as his lawyer. He is also more inclined to go into the gangster way of doing things, trying to guide Abel in that direction too. He considers arming the drivers with pistols to counteract the hijackings but Abel argues it could prove to be more trouble than its worth. Being a comedian for much of his career, he makes for great imposing authority figures in crime dramas with his performance as a gangster in Drive being one of his best roles and he fits the role like a glove.\nJ.C. Chandor is one of the more promising directors and writers, sporting a small number of films but are all nevertheless impressive. He has a great knack for character driven films and tense moments wrought with heavy dialogue. Even though All Is Lost is basically devoid of any dialogue but it is still thrilling and captivating. He presents people who aren't perfect and puts their morality under a magnifying glass with much of the characters in the financial drama Margin Call fitting that model. It's not surprising that he got an Oscar nomination for best screenplay for Margin Call. While not full of the gun battles, explosions, car chases and gratuitous violence that is permanent in various gangster films, it instead takes a restrained approach to things. \nAlthough there was an effective and exciting car chase that later led to a foot chase that really got you in. I really liked how he went about putting a normal business like oil and heating and placing it against a mob type setting. The interactions that the characters have with one another makes for an interesting dynamic when you realize that these guys aren't cold blooded killers, just guys who want the edge on their competition. It's a slow burner where the characters are allowed to simmer where it makes it hard to guess where their emotions will take them. The dialogue is rich with intensity where you don't really expect it too. Chastain has such a great way of speaking that's threatening and condescending and she just takes everything head on. The back and forth interactions between everyone was a joy to listen to and made it much more rich and developed. \nThe scene where Abel is coaching his new recruits how to take charge of their customers was wrought with intensity and takes it up a notch when he talks down to an employee who laughs at the all too wrong moment. If it were a true gangster movie, you would have expected the boss to level him with a baseball bat like Al Capone in The Untouchables. That's how effective A Most Violent year is in that it perfectly copies what we expect from gangster films and transports them to another movie and setting where the central character is doing all that he can to not be a gangster. It feels like a 70s throwback crime drama where action wasn't the central piece of entertainment and the dialogue and complex characters dominate the screen. It ended on somewhat of a happy note but in a direction that begets an interesting scenario for all involved. It's a little ambiguous but it becomes a little clearer when you notice the previous moments in the film.\nFilms like A Most Violent Year can be hard to peg sometimes. There isn't much violence or bare knuckle action like many expected, but a film shouldn't always contain everything that it's about in the title. Sometimes I enjoy a slow burning drama that just captivates you with dialogue and story that unwanted action would have weighed it down and mad the film worthless in the end. If one puts in the time and doesn't expect a Scorsese film, you will come out the other end with a gem. A little too talky for some with not much of the payoff one may expect, it still has plenty of thrills with a pair of amazing performances that dominate the screen. The payoff that some may want wouldn't have made it a better film necessarily. But going the route it went leaves it with an air of ambiguity that says more than going a more pedestrian route would.

            "content": "Equally inventive, humorous, well-acted, as well as intelligent, but also slightly pretentious and a bit gimmicky, Birdman is an interesting film. It's a film that serves to pulverize or ingratiate with its quirkiness or originality, depending on how one interprets it.  It's a black comedy, a character study, and perhaps a tragedy. Above all, it's memorable.\n\nThe film follows a washed-up former blockbuster star as he endeavors to prove his dramatic talent by putting on a Broadway play. Along the way he must contend not only with the nightmare logistics, but also his alter-ego, who continually questions his decisions and worth.\n\nThe script was sharp and offered a lot of higher brow humor mixed in with some witty dialogue. It was stylized in parts, though not overly so for most of its run. The narrative was kept largely focused, and we are totally transformed in to the film's world. We get a unique view of not only the theater system, but also an insightful commentary on us, the viewing public, and our narcissistic, attention obsessed society.\n\nThe performances have been rightly lauded, with Michael Keaton being nothing short of brilliant. The entire cast is in fact exceptional, with Edward Norton bringing a lot of self-parody and charm to his role. The direction keeps the film running briskly; it's always engaging, and never dry. If there's criticism to be had, one would have to say that the third act gets overly indulgent. His other persona becomes more of a distraction than an actual service to the narrative and the realism is sacrificed. The ending note is also unduly ambiguous and pretentious.\n\n\nOverall, well worth a watch.\n\n4/5 Stars",

Interesting and funny. Because, in general, Oscars are for crowd-pleasers. I'm not suggesting that the Oscar films are bad, I'm suggesting just that, in general, are audience friendly.\n\nBirdman isn't. Yes, it stars Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, but it isn't audience-friendly. And those of you who try to make it like this, please stop, because it's ridiculous.\n\nBut is it Oscar worthy? Couldn't tell. Haven't seen the rest of the nominated films . But could an less audience-friendly film grab an oscar? Should it? Of course! If it deserves it, yes.\n\nNow, many people are living or feeding the delusion that the quality of a film is determined by how many people like it and if you and most of your didn't like a film, that film is bad. Nope, it doesn't work like that, I'm afraid. Cinema is not a big Miss Popularity contest. There are certain criteria to be followed and none of them imply the fact that a certain film \"bored you\", or \"you just didn't like it\", or \"it doesn't make sense/it isn't interesting\".

I liked how the voice in Keaton's head was sometimes demeaning and sometimes uplifting, and it seemed very human. But in general, I can't completely get into the style. I'm an emotionally inhibited person. I just can't relate very well to people constantly displaying over the top emotion and always telling people exactly how they feel (and as a guy who writes movie scripts, that's against the rules too) and being really angry and horny and such. Guess that means I'm not ready to be an actor. Keaton gives a solid performance. Unfortunately, he was up against some amazing performances this Oscar season, and I actually rate him at the bottom of the nominees. The supporting cast was stellar. Inarritu, of course, added some really great images. On the whole it was, uh, flighty and slightly disconnected, but that is appropriate. The score is grating and distracting, but fits Keaton's character's mental illness.

There is a contradictory muddle of themes throughout, and actually that matches perfectly with the astounding camera work. It never stops moving. Add a jazz drum score and you're well away. Maybe it's corny, but for me the only unifying theme in this film is love. Whether it's love for your family, for your work, for the theatre or for cinema... and that's not just a sappy thing... sometimes ones love for one thing can block the understanding of another... or maybe you're just too in love with yourself.

Valuable more as a psychological exploration of the relationships between art, artists, reality and intentions, \"Birdman\" is occasionally too vulgar and contrary in its style, but it is a valuable viewing for those of the artistic stripe and immensely thought provoking. Also, it takes some delightful jabs at the current superhero blockbuster craze.",

Michael Keaton is a great actor and I'm going to be honest the role of Riggan was great for him he plays the part extremely well but Edward Nortan stole the show if you ask me his performance as Mike is probably one of the best performances ever (next to Fight Club (1999)).

Perhaps the difference in our opinions can be found in my empathy with the aging Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, who was trying to reinvent himself. Torn between his fear that his critics were correct , his own insecurities, and his waning self-belief,  Riggan's only solace is found in a voice which he is convinced \"always tells him the truth.\" Perhaps it is just an ego challenge, men experience, but I could certainly relate to Riggan's uncertainity that his life has had any lasting legacy. \n\nWhile my evaluation of this film would be closer to the critic's 93% as opposed to the audience's 79%. I would imagine my wife's rating would be lower than the audience average. Maybe women do not face the same insecurities about the contribution to life they have made. Then again maybe only those men who tend to over-analyze everything share Riggan's doubts.",

It feels forced, like the movie is told from an inconsistent viewpoint in which the viewer is to assume sometimes you're following the thoughts and actions of Michael Keaton, and sometimes just wandering around and seeing what other characters are thinking or feeling.\nIt's a mess, honestly, beautiful to behold but forced into a perspective of unknown perspective. I feel like this movie won some awards not just because they felt it deserved them, but more on the perspective that it seemed almost continuous. \nBottom line, if you don't like artsy movies, this movie will not amaze you, nor will it feel like anything beautiful. The character transcendence seems to take a back seat to the camera trick, and it will leave you confused and uncaring at the end.\n\nNot really a movie for the masses, but people will watch it because it won those awards....",

It also has very neat visuals.For instance, we have this small indie film made on a small budget and it's very impressive how the blockbuster aspect was done.\n\nThe story is original. We have this actor famous for playing a superhero in a movie franchise and is performing in this play. It also has the feel of a superhero film in that the protagonist can move stuff around and has these visions where his environment is like a superhero flick. It also plays out like the real world as it references recent Blockbuster films.\n\nThe acting is great. It has brilliant performances from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone. During the parts where the characters are performing in a play, the actors and actresses make it very believable.\n\nOverall, this was a very impressive film and I think it deserved that best picture Oscar.

Michael Keaton was on fire in a role that any audience member would say is a perfect fit! In addition to his performance, the film has a rich and talented supporting cast. The director's use long moving shots created the perfect amount of space that brought out their best and elevated every single roll; and the scene transitions were spectacular!\nKeaton is Riggan Thomson, a former blockbuster Hollywood phenomenon that has fallen out of the limelight, and is left clinging to his career by becoming a serious Broadway actor. However he is not alone. No, no, no, Thomson has a friend, his doppelganger ... the Birdman! And he demonstrates from the get-go how powerful an influence he is on Riggan. I'm not even sugar coating it; Birdman (or should I say Thomson?) actually has super powers.\nNot to downplay the \"super human\" element to this movie, but this film is not great because of a powerful fictitious hero. This movie is great because it is an original and introspective film into the minds of those we put on stage.\nIt was absolutely fascinating. You see, the film is based on Keaton's character (Riggan Thomson) debuting a play on Broadway, and throughout the film you get to see the all rehearsals and previews leading all the way up to the debut!\nWhat was fascinating was, as you watch this film, you will see Keaton (or Norton and etc.) play their roles (in the film) and all in one shot, you see them shift their roles and they acting as separate characters- on the stage!\nThis film draws you in with its main character. It sucks you in with the plot. The dialogue is ingenious and it is all shot as if it came straight from the theatre and it was playing right on stage in front of your faces!\nBirdman is currently nominated for 9 Academy Awards including Best Picture.

Another compliment is that is seems beautifully, crisply filmed, carefully cut to make it look like one continuous shot. But that last thing got old really fast for me. The most annoying thing? The drums. The first 20 minutes of continuous drums made me want to bang my head against the wall - reading in one review that those drums go on for the full two hours was enough to turn it off. Something that feels like something learned in drama class, without the student understanding that for many people, it's not artsy but forced, intrusive and simply unbearable.

He was just so good, he sort of outshines everyone else just because he is confident, egotistical, but also very sympathetic. All of the characters are sympathetic because the acting is that good and the characters are the friends we all have; prideful, hoping to be noticed, to be affirmed and loved for who they are and what they can accomplish. I can't help thinking Keaton took this role because it mirrors his career in eery ways. I'm sure others have pointed this out, I haven't read much on the film, but he was Batman (Birdman) twenty years ago and now he creates a masterful work of art, pouring his soul into every frame (scene) in this movie (play). Keaton is very good, especially his scene with the critic. A side note about that scene, I respect critics but they also piss me off because they're like so many others who critique what they themselves can't make, let alone make better. Anyways, Alejandro's direction is graceful and story driven, even his camerawork advances the drama. This is how movies are made! This is well crafted scripting and conflict. Unfortunately, the ending strikes me as a moral conundrum. I can't give anything away but the arguments go on as to what did exactly happen. If one thing happened, then his journey comes full circle and he really is becoming someone better to himself, to his daughter and to his craft. If the other thing happened, then nothing matters because it's just wrong and tragic for everyone. I'm not really a fan of black comedies but this did have it's funny parts. Again I come back to Norton, he just rocked it, his character was so interesting. I would watch this again just to study the character dynamics, dialogue, and coverage of the conversations and action. Worth the watch and worth the philosophical arguments that stem from it.",

            "content": "Perhaps the most technically and narratively ambitious movie of the year, with its seamless illusory editing, feverishly percussive score, and lyrically brutal showbiz fable. An aging former superhero mounts his comeback by quadruple-threating the short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" by Raymond Carver.  \n\nThere are just so many moments I love in the movie: the flash of jellyfish at the beginning foreshadowing Riggan's botched suicide years earlier; Riggan's restrained breakdown when he leverages his false childhood abuse story against Mike's for yuks; the tighty-whities lock-out sequence primed by the trailer (and parodied so brilliantly by NPH and Miles Teller at the Oscars) but made so much more tragicomic in full by Keaton's unblinking purposeful stride, the camera-ready viral media sensation culture, and the rousing staccato beats of the Times Square drumline.\n\nI also really love the ex-wife character played so naturally by Amy Ryan. Sylvia and Riggan's comfortable exes dynamic and Sylvia's on-the-outside-of-showbiz-looking-in reasoning for why their marriage ended really resonated with me. Michael Keaton is the perfect oxymoron of likable asshole, and Zach Galifianakis is surprisingly unschticky as the producer/best friend. I was surprised that he was passed over for a Best Supporting Actor nod in favor of Edward Norton, who was frankly just okay in the difficult task of playing an actor playing out a scene that is supposed to be good. Emma Stone's bug-eyed, strung-out, angry tirade has gotten most of the attention, but I honestly think she is a Better Supporting Actress in her quieter moments: slinking through the hallways, the come-hither dares on the rooftop, the fragile candle-burning-at-both-ends intensity about which Mike rhapsodizes.\n\nIt's not a perfect movie; the magical realism is somewhat inconsistent, but I think it's deserving of its Oscar wins.",

            "content": "From: http://justathoughtfilmandmedia.tumblr.com\n\nYou've probably seen this movie and thought, \"wow, such art.\" Well it's true, it's a work of art, mostly... The ending, although widely thought to be creative in it's ambiguity, I felt was very much a cop-out of not being able to devise an proper ending worthy enough of the questions of insanity and depression it boldly raises. That's my thesis, but I'll elaborate more on that later.\n\nMichael Keaton should have won best actor. While Redmayne was amazing in the Hawking biopic, it played much to the standard of what the academy expects of a dramatist (the movie was arguably only made for a platform in order for an actor to play Hawking in order to bait an Oscar worthy performance); the nuances of Keaton's performance takes the cake for me mainly because he was playing a popularly perceived version of himself, and thus nobody else could have done it but him. If I were the academy, the Oscar for original screenplay would have been replaced by Keaton's performance, and gone to The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), thus kept it at 4 little golden men for the film.\n\nThe directing and cinematography for the movie is to be adulated. The what-seemed-to-be-an-extremely-long-take subterfuge is what made the movie a must see, and it is dome better than its predecessor Anna Karenina, the most recent version film adaptation of the classic Russian novel, which was ultimately a disaster-but not because of its seamlessness.\n\nThe theme of Hollywood's triteness and ingenuity of recent is brought up and seemed to be answered by the very original piece, the movie itself. And the very much meta play-within-film aspect of the movie, although not original is very hard to do nonetheless, works to it's advantage and executed very well.\n\nThe drama is well made, and is what seems to be a perfect film, masterpiece even. Until you watch it again (the dialogue about the man who failed to commit suicide at the beginning of the film was too explicit and I caught during the first viewing, after seeing what the climax of the play was it pretty much ruined the ending for me). The film seems to me a gimmick. Performances are standard, but not at all better than it should be for a best picture. Who didn't see the Norton-Stone romance a mile away? These may seem nit picky, but I don't think so.\nI, at first, fell for the ending as much as anyone, but in a different manner. I was mad more so than bewildered. I was not \"played,\" and I didn't buy it. The film raised very important questions about insanity and depression and the state of Hollywood and how to fight for its art. Even if it ended with clear-cut suicide, making the statement of \"you can't fight it,\" is better than the equivocal stunt they pulled. On the other hand, if they kept the ending happy, classical-Hollywood style, I would have been disappointed, yes, but at least not disparaged. They really couldn't have devised an ending that is worthy of best-picture? If it didn't win best-picture I wouldn't complain, trust me, but it did! That changes things.\nTo be fair, the competition this year didn't seem to be very good (I mean, Whiplash was nominated, it was great, but not that great; and there is no way they were going to give it to the corny American Sniper. Thank God they didn't do that). So I guess they had to give it to Birdman.\n\nimage\nAll I am saying is that this movie is not as good as you think it is.\n\nIt is not going to be a movie that is worth repeated viewings, especially not on television-unless you're a film student, writer, etc. Will this movie stand the test of time? Certainly not the way The Prestige (Nolan), Fight Club (Fincher), or other timeless non-academy award winners will go down in cinematic history. To even mention legendary classics such as Gladiator (Scott) or Shawshank Redemption (Darabont) in the same discourse is blasphemy on my part. And, to be quite frank, I am going to lump Birdman in the Driving Miss Daisy category: Winner-yes, Classic-no.\n\nUltimately it is not the filmmakers' fault; it is the lack of redoubtable features in the year of 2014 that is to blame. This film is an unmitigated work of art. Of course it is, I am not denying that. What it is not is a large piece of cinematic history.\nCinema is greater than art. A great film needs to manifest magic. This movie lacks magic, and I argue it is because of a cop-out ending. Be bold! Dare to answer. That ambiguous ending shit is played out. Nolan is known for it, but his masterpieces The Prestige and Momento do not even include one-both better movies that Birdman.\n\nI would give it a two if it wasn't for the Cinematography and Editing (or lack there of?)\n\n 3/4 stars...\n\nbut what do I know?\nTime is the ultimate arbiter, and it will expose the film for what it really is in a fleeting moment.\n\nJust a thought",

While I remain engrossed in the wacky antics of protagonist Michael Keaton and company, I still cannot help but marvel at and attempt to decipher how director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and crew manage to pull off a narrative composed of an apparent one-take tracking shot. Not only do the filmmakers use this device to expertly emulate the immediacy of the theatre and the inner tension of the tortured protagonist, they somehow still manage to create some beautiful framing and visuals that transcend a simple documentary-style approach. This is some Hitchcock-ian level detailed planning.\n\nNot to be outdone by the brilliant direction and photography, the cast also shines bright. Keaton, no doubt, pulls off the best (and seemingly most personal) performance of his career, and I cannot be more excited for him and the comeback that this role, not doubt, is facilitating. Edward Norton as pretentious method theatre actor, and Zach Galifianakis as producer/Keaton's agent also do some really strong work here -- almost stealing Keaton's thunder from time to time.\n\nOverall, it's a fun story that certainly has lots of relevance in today's Hollywood and Broadway cultures -- especially in regards to the box office celebrity vs. artist themes. While I really enjoy the fantasy elements featuring Keaton's \"Birdman\" alter ego (these scenes feature some fantastic imagery and acting), I am reticent to heap too much praise on the narrative because of just how on-the-nose these moments are in their hammering of film's message and obvious representation of the protagonist's inner psyche. It's an admittedly minor complaint for me, but I think Birdman honestly just needs a tad more subtlety in here. Just a tad.",

It can turn off some of the audience because of its quick pace and smart ass dialogue but the power and intensity of the film can be felt throughout especially in the actors' brilliant performances and the director's guidance.

            "content": "Birdman is one of those movies that is kind of hard to review. I liked this movie yet it was just kind of annoying in one specific way that I will get to at the end of this. I could appreciate the fact that this movie was edited to look like one entire shot, but just because you do something different doesn't make your movie good. And it felt like there was no real reason behind making the movie like that. But it did give the cinematographer Emmanual Lubezki a big challenge and he pulled it off perfectly and it was really no surprise to me that he won this year at the oscars either because he also won the oscar for best cinematography for his work on Gravity and the Cinematography in that movie was absolutely perfect, but that movie was just practice for Birdman. Because if you look at the first five minutes of the movie Gravity the camera stays on one shot for that length of time and it didn't make any cuts until it needed. But in Birdman he was able to pull off making a movie look like one shot. And I applaud Emmanuel because it worked and it looked great. He deserved the oscar this year for his work on this movie. \n\tNow onto Birdman itself this movie is very good and very topical on what's been going on for the last THIRTEEN YEARS. I say thirteen because that is technically when this age of superhero movies that we're experiencing right now started. And it started with the first Spiderman movie way back in 2002 (The one with Tobey Maguire.)  And with all the other movies out there such as Iron Man, The Avengers, Guardians of The Galaxy and many many others this movie could be the future for all the actors in those movies and what's going to happen to them once they try to break the mold. Now what I'm about to say next is something I'm just assuming, but everyone has been saying this is why Michael Keaton was chosen for the part: but I think that Michael Keaton was chosen to be the lead role for this movie because he played Batman at one point in time. Even though this movie was fake for Keaton this very well could be what he's been experiencing in recent years. Birdman is about a former action star who's trying to get some respect by \"Making art\", break the mold of what an action star can do and he wants to stay relevant, but it's becoming hard to do so with all the junk going on in his life. And Keaton plays the part really well.\n\tMichael Keatons plays the character Riggan (Or Birdman) and he's trying to juggle a lot of things going on in his life mainly his career, but now he has a new actor for his play that's totally insane, his daughter who just got out of rehab and a girl he's banging who says that she's pregnant, but to top it all off he has to deal with his own insecurities which are manifesting themselves in the form of his former role Birdman. One thing I wanted to mention about the movie was how it used the music to a great effect in my eyes or rather my ears. Because if you listen to the music it doesn't have any other instruments playing other than just drums and rather than adding anything in they juts have the drums playing and drums without any other instrument to accompany it is just noise and in a way they used the drums to kind of get us to get inside Riggans head and to help us realize that there's ALOT of noise going on inside his head almost as much as the voice inside. And the voice in his head is justt as bad as everything else in his life because everything that annoying pest says he either contradicting to something he said earlier or he's right and is only adding more pressure to Riggan during times when he really doesn't need it. And his former role is sort of the embodiment of the mindset behind most action movies nowadays: Screw the phillosophical BS and lets make a movie that rakes in the money and gets everyone to shut off their minds. Nobody wants to think when they're watching a movie.\n\tThe thing I hated about this movie though is that it has an ambiguous ending. If you're going to end your movie just end it and don't beat around the bush. It's such a lazy thing to do and it infuriates me and for that reason I'm taking a star off. Other than that Birdman is a very well crafted movie and it does such a good job with most of the things it meant to accomplish mainly the cinematography. Well done to everyone who participated in making this movie happen.",

Keaton is back at the top of his game in a film that is a sort of parody like feature which covers a character who is strangely similar to its main role, it makes you wonder if Keaton in real life is going through something similar but I believe that's actually part of its purpose to make you question your own sanity. We now know what Robert Downey Jr will do once he's of age along with all of the avengers cast, Keaton continues to set the standard as the ultimate super hero actor as well as flexing his mind and showing any doubters what he's really about.

            "content": "Don't always believe the hype. Other than the phenomenal acting and visual effects, I don't understand why people love it so much. The plot is SUPER confusing. The story follows a man near the opening of his play which he has directed, written, and acts in. During the story it follows the cast on some of their adventures and interactions with each other around the theater. It mainly follows the director, Riggan, as he undergoes unclear mental issues and drug addictions and occasionally work on his play. The story started to get confusing as soon as the movie started when he is meditating in the air and causally just floats down and just talks to someone. Throughout the film he is seen using powers like lifting objects with the flick of his wrist, and flying, but the story makes it very unclear whether he has these powers or he was just imagining it. The story even contradicts itself when in one scene he flies throughout the city and then when he lands an angry cab driver demands his pay and then at the end of the film he jumps out the window and starts flying which is proven by the fact that his daughter looks to the sky and laughs. The comedy was also very stale. The only time I ever laughed in the movie was when mike (Edward Norton) complains about drinking water instead of alcohol. I could barley recognize any comedy anywhere. The plot was also WAY too predictable. When I was watching, I felt like I was ten minutes ahead of the film because I was always anticipating what was coming next. The only thing unexpected was when he shoots himself and miraculously survives, and without a scratch which confuses me because they said there was blood, but there wasn't even a single blemish on his face after he takes off the bandages. Also I had a problem with the audio from the film.Whenever important conversations were going on, there was always some loud music (mostly drums) playing it the back, making it EXTREMELY difficult to understand what the characters are saying. Finally, I think the Birdman character is explained too vaguely. I think explaining Birdman is important because it will give a little insight as to what powers Riggan has at his disposal. I know Birdman is supposed to be a rip off of Batman (Mainly because he's a flying mammal, talks in a Bruce Wayne accent most of the time, and is a very sneaky superhero who says he wants a movie to be named something like\"The Birdman Rises\" or some other Batman movie name) which means he will act like Batman, but he has a very different move set from Batman since he can fly.  Overall great acting and visuals, but the plot was so terrible I cannot recommend people watching this movie if you care about a good story.",

Michael Keaton gives the best performance of his career. It's a great performance and watching the character struggle with his ego and come to terms accepting that maybe he just isn't very good is both funny and sad. I really enjoyed this movie for Michael Keaton (which it really is all about), but when he's not on camera and there's a shift in focus to other characters the movie loses a bit of its luster. Not to say there weren't some memorable or funny moments early on in the movie, it just wasn't as good as what was to come.\n\nOf course a lot of people will enjoy this movie, but it's about getting through that first act.

I give it four and a half stars because there were some flaws. The fight scene between Riggin and Mike does not ring true. Also, there are some loose ends, for example, the relationship between Mike and Sam, that were left unresolved. However, these are minor. I am guessing that this movie will be a game changer.

Ojo, con esto no estoy reparando en las pel\u00edculas cl\u00e1sicas de este g\u00e9nero, v\u00e9ase Batman o incluso Superman por citar dos ejemplos por todos conocidos.  \nEl nombre \"Birdman\"  me suger\u00eda que la pel\u00edcula estar\u00eda basada en aquella caricatura  que pasaban por Cartoon Network hace d\u00e9cadas. Resulto ser todo lo contrario, \"Birdman\" es la ant\u00edtesis de estas super-producciones, creo que la filmaron en una toma, los efectos especiales son espor\u00e1dicos, incluso la banda sonora es jocosa, ya que la interpreta un baterista que incluso llega a aparecer en una toma. \nBirdman es una  critica muy \u00e1cida al mundillo de los blockbusters , llega enhorabuena, ya que \u00faltimamente no parecen existir pel\u00edculas decentes, todo lo producido es meramente dise\u00f1ado para entretener a la mayor cantidad de consumidores posibles, sirviendo quiz\u00e1s \u00fanicamente para vender mu\u00f1equitos de cera coleccionables y cajitas felices en los Mcdonals.  , \nResulta parad\u00f3jico ver a Keaton  interpretando el papel de Birdman, pareciera ser un reflejo de su vida misma, ya que fue el quien alguna vez interpreto al caballero de la noche. En el transcurso de la pel\u00edcula, destaca la lucha de este para no ceder ante  o que damos por sentado hoy en d\u00eda. Es decir, medir nuestra popularidad por el n\u00famero de seguidores o likes en el mundo virtual. \nExiste una mofa muy bien intencionada, que incluso se llega a confundir con pretensi\u00f3n, no obstante esto no es atribuible a la pel\u00edcula en s\u00ed, es mas bien una sensaci\u00f3n que se da mientras uno la ve. \nEn fin, me alegr\u00f3 ver una pel\u00edcula as\u00ed, una que me inspire a escribir incluso una breve rese\u00f1a.

            "content": "In Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a nearly washed-up actor best known for playing a Hollywood super-hero called Birdman (not unlike Batman whom Keaton famously played in the first two films of that franchise in 1989 and 1992 directed by Tim Burton). Riggan is desperate to escape the shadow of the role that made him famous and he puts everything he's got on the line (financially, emotionally, mentally) to direct and star in a dramatic play based on a short story by Raymond Carver that he desperately hopes will salvage his reputation if not resurrect his career. Along the way, Riggan battles with everyone around him (his co-stars, his lover, his daughter) and with Birdman himself, who appears like a specter or perhaps more accurately like one of those little devils floating above cartoon characters' heads whispering evil encouragements, here life-size and with huge menacing wings. All the while, Emmanuel Lubezki's camera literally follows Riggen, mostly through the dark interiors of the St. James Theater where the film is set in extremely long shots edited together as if in one long take, creating a powerful sense of propulsion and urgency.\n\nKeaton gives a committed performance, ironically playing down his usual squinty-eyed disapproval of everyone and everything around him, portraying a man who is put-upon by the world and trying to do just one good and worthy thing. Naomi Watts and Zach Galifianakis turn in typically strong performances while Emma Stone as Riggan's daughter Sam leaves little room for shades of gray in her exaggerated role as a druggie pessimist. The plot is as contained as the set and some scenes feel forced or even unnecessary. To what purpose other than titillation do we see Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough lock lips? And the casualness with which Riggan finishes a joint he finds on Sam after ripping into her for still using drugs feels like a weak attempt at portraying hypocrisy. Yet just as often there are remarkable scenes, such as when Keaton and Ed Norton as Riggan's co-star in the play run through a scene in rehearsal, Norton's infamous bad-boy stage actor Mike flashing his acting chops to a fiery yet receptive Riggan.\n\nThrough it all runs a magical realism that finds Riggan floating in the air and moving objects with his mind. The effects are outstanding, particularly a scene where Riggan literally flies over New York City. This reflection of Riggan's Birdman, both the character and the inner demon, is potentially undercut by the film's final scene in which Emma Stone's Sam is seen staring out a window breaking into a smile apparently observing Riggan floating in the air. The impossibility of that occurring in real life can perhaps best be explained as being imagined images flashing through Riggan's mind as he lay dying on stage after shooting himself in the head. Or perhaps he died earlier, jumping off the roof in the afore-memtioned scene that feels so real it's shocking until Riggan re-appears soaring over the city street. The director himself has been mum on explaining the film's ending except to say that it replaced an earlier \"bad\" ending. One has to wonder if that earlier ending was the more expected if not predictably satisfying one in which Sam, in a rare display of affection, lays her head on Riggan's chest in the hospital where he lay recuperating from that gunshot wound that turned out to be a minor injury. Though even that defies logic as the way the gunshot is filmed, it seems clear Riggan is holding the gun directly to his head; in the hospital he's told he shot his nose off but when he removes the bandage all we really see is a huge bruise. The ending will surely divide its audience and that's not a bad thing as ultimately Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), infused with questions about the value of art and the power of criticism, certainly gives viewers much to chew on.",

This movie thinks about those issues really deeply.  I related to it very much. So by being able to connect to the essential questiosn in the film, does that make me a huge egoist?

            "content": "The term 'Oscar bait' is an interesting little concept.  If you've been living under a movie nerd rock, this essentially means that some films are made simply for the chance to get a lot of Oscar nominations.  They do this by pandering to what the Academy likes.  Whether it be stories of perseverance in the face of extreme adversity or subversiveness and/or satire of the business these people find themselves in.  These films are strategically marketed in order to be fresh in the minds of Oscar voters, which is why a lot of them are released in November/December prior to the Oscars.  While I agree that there is some thing as Oscar bait, in the sense that some films are made strictly for that purpose, at the same time, does that mean that the final edit of the film is any less because of it?  If the film is great then isn't that what should matter in the long run?  The Oscars are self-serving as it stands.  I guess this is brought on due to the fact that the film's main character Riggan Thomson is an alcoholic, schizophrenic on the verge of losing his mind due to the mounting stress of putting on a play that, from all accounts, seems like it's gonna be a disaster.  That's the type of shit the Academy loves, right?  Well I found this movie to be excellent, maybe not Best Movie material, though I reserve the right to change my mind as I write out this review.  First things first, Michael Keaton is absolutely incredible here.  I don't mean to suggest that Keaton is a washed up actor or anything of the sort, but the character of Riggan Thomson is in, many ways, much like Keaton's career himself after he stopped playing the Batman character.  So maybe because of that, Keaton felt an attachment to the script and to the role itself.  It doesn't mirror Keaton's career exactly, but it's close enough to the real thing where Keaton pulls it off in a incredibly believable manner.  You can just see this man, obsessed with putting on a perfect play in order to prove to the world that he can, outside of putting on a costume to play a superhero, playing to the lowest common denominator, produce meaningful and worthwhile art.  Of course, on the way to putting on the perfect play he faces his own ego, a method actor, Shiner played by the always great Edward Norton, who seemingly tries to sabotage Riggan's play at every turn, his own struggles with his family and his attempts to make everything right after being such a fuck-up, a theater critic that wants Riggan's play to fail at any cost so she'll write a negative review about it regardless, Birdman's voice continually mocking him and his attempts at being taken seriously as an artist when he could, just as easily, be making billions on a film franchise.  He's also facing the complete disdain from the theater crowd, who just sees him as a talentless hack.  All of these things, particularly with Riggan's mental state, has filled him with such stress and insecurity that you almost exactly know how everything's gonna turn out and it's not a happy ending, which we'll get to later.  This is really a satire of theater snobbery, summer blockbusters, Hollywood pretentiousness (from Riggan's point of view, at least).  Here's this guy who's been known only for his Birdman series taking a very serious undertaking in the form of a Broadway play when he has absolutely no experience on the stage.  The film's tagline, The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, also the title of the theater critic's review in the film, very obviously applies to Riggan's attempts to put on this play.  Riggan's pretentiousness clearly got the better of him.  His attempts to remain relevant in an ever-changing world has done a number on him.  He wants to be famous again, but he wants to be famous on his own terms, he wants to be appreciated for his art, not for a character where you barely got to see his face behind the mask.  It is pretty excellent character development if you ask me and the cast is replete.  The film is very funny, which makes the eventuality of Riggan's path all the more powerful.  Which brings us to the ending, or part of it  There will be ****MASSIVE SPOILERS**** so skip ahead.  Riggan finally loses his mind, or what was left of it, when he gets into an argument with the theater critic the day before his play premieres, there have been several previews prior to this that have been disastrous.  Essentially, the critic will give Riggan's play a bad review regardless of what happens on-stage, because she hates Riggan's kind, the Hollywood type, who think they can come in and take over their chosen field of profession, or what they review in her case.  This is also a satire of the nature of some film criticism where people make up their mind based on preconceived notions rather than giving the film a fair shot.  Riggan then proceeds to get drunk off his ass and falls asleep on an apartment's steps.  He's woken up by Birdman, mocking him yet again, and telling him to get over himself and to stop this pretentious bullshit and give the audience what they want, which is action, blood, death, etc.  Riggan finally agrees with Birdman on something, after trying to get rid of him all throughout the film, and he decides to give the audience something that they will never forget.  All the while explosions and giant bird robots destroy New York City (all in Riggan's mind).  You can guess where this is going to lead.  By this point, Riggan has already plotted ahead how his own journey will end in his mind.  Keep that in mind.  The play culminates with Riggan's character killing himself at his lowest point.  So Riggan, wanting to give the audience something they'll never forget, actually shoots himself on stage at the climax of the play.  You believe that he's dead, only for the next scene to be at the hospital where, it is revealed, that Riggan only shot his nose off and how he got a new one.  His play is a success, they got a great review from that theater critic, he's relevant again and, most importantly, his family is back together again.  Sounds a little odd, does it not?  I think the biggest hint that something is off here is that, when Riggan reveals his new nose, there are no stitches around it.  Assuming this took place a day after Riggan shot his nose off, there would HAVE to be stitches.  You could say that this was just an oversight, a tiny mistake.  But, watching this film, and its attention to detail, and how impeccably edited it was, this isn't accident.  Every shot is calculated and measured.  This is what Alejandro Gonzales I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and his team of editors wanted you to see.  It's a very obvious clue as to what's going on here.  Everything is just too perfectly resolved.  My theory is, and this seems to be the popular theory, is that what you saw at the end was a construct of Riggan's own self-conscious.  This was the way he would've wanted to see his life end.  He's beloved by his family, beloved by the people, and beloved by the critics.  These are some things that few people ever manage to achieve separately, much less at the same time.  Riggan wanted to die at his 'peak', if you will.  So people would talk about him for ages and ages.  Of course, the theory changes a bit because I believe that Riggan DID shoot himself in the head, rather than shooting his nose clean off, and he's in a coma nearing death.  The final shot of the film, with Sam looking up and seeing her father's powers, was symbolic because this was the moment where Riggan died.  That's my opinion.  It's very possible that the ending actually did happen, but I happen to doubt that very much.  You know, reviewing this film, I've come to the realization that my score of 4 stars is simply too low.  I'll bump that up to 4.5 stars.  I think there's simply too much greatness here for the film to be anything less than 4.5.  The writing is absolutely fabulous, the editing is perfection, makes every scene look like it's one long take.  The acting from the cast is excellent, with Keaton being absolutely incredible here.  And I think this is a film that will reward repeat viewings.  There's a lot of subtext here that I probably missed, repeat viewings will definitely tear that down.  This is an excellent film, one that's more of an acquired taste than you'd think, but one that's worth watching nonetheless.  I realize this means that, to some people who hated the film, this makes me an idiot, but I honestly don't give a shit.  I thought the film was great and I think I've done a decent job as to explaining why.  If you don't like it, then I'm sorry, that's why they are called OPINIONS.  There's no right or wrong.  This is surreal, but it's an excellent movie.",

            "content": "Despite a phenomenal performance from Michael Keaton, \"Birdman\" is a frustrating, polarizing and ultimately disappointing film that fails to live up to the hype. While far from a total failure- given that this is the film that took home the Oscar for Best Picture- it could have been so much more. On the one hand, I definitely admire aspects to this film from the brilliant performances to the marvelous cinematography. Yet, regardless of these superior qualities, it's a film that leaves the viewer conflicted. To start with the positive first, the acting is absolutely amazing. Each and every star is at the top of their game, particularly Michael Keaton who delivers the finest performance of his career. Edward Norton is also a joy to watch; charismatic, charming and full of life. Even Emma Stone steps out of her comfort zone to deliver what may be the best performance of her career to date. Did I even mention Zach Galifianikis? Apart from the acting, the writing is truly breathtaking. Putting the audience into the head of a conflicted movie-star, it is filled with sharp, funny and often thought-provoking dialogue that raises questions about the movie-making business. Then there' s the intense one-shot cinematography, which is unlike anything I've ever seen before in a movie. However, it's ultimately not enough to make up for a film that's paced poorly. While the first-half of the film is incredibly exciting to watch unfold, it loses steam towards the end. To elaborate, the movie takes ridiculous twists and turns that seem to go nowhere. The ending, though, is a major disappointment. Nonsensical, confusing and leaving important questions unanswered, it left me more irritated than awe-struck. Taking everything into account, \"Birdman\" is a film that definitely needs to be seen more than once to be fully understood. It provides interesting insights into movie-business, critics and the pressures of being an actor in today's media-driven world. However, in the bigger picture, it only offers glimpses of genius. I definitely admire the film for it's risky choices, ambition and originality, but in the end it fell short of my expectations. Whether you like it or not, will ultimately depend on your patience as a viewer. Regardless, if there's one reason why it's worth watching, it's for Michael Keaton's timeless performance that will long be remembered in the years to come.",

Deust\u00faa\n\nEl director mexicano Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu derrocha talento t\u00e9cnico en su nueva pel\u00edcula, \"Birdman o la inesperada virtud de la ignorancia\", con una oscura y densa narraci\u00f3n que bien puede ser el peso que le impida volar. Cada espectador lo decidir\u00e1.\n\nHace casi 30 a\u00f1os Riggan Thompson era \"Birdman\", gran superh\u00e9roe de la taquilla, pero renunci\u00f3 al papel aunque el personaje nunca lo dej\u00f3 a \u00e9l. Hoy d\u00eda gast\u00f3 todo su dinero en una obra teatral de Broadway que \u00e9l protagoniza, dirige, produce y escribe con la idea de recuperar su propio orgullo como actor y persona, fuera del dinero y fama \"f\u00e1ciles\" del cine.\n\nIntensidad es la palabra clave para todo salvo para el libreto. El gui\u00f3n es directo al retratar la crisis de su protagonista y su lucha personal por sobrevivir a s\u00ed mismo, aunque al mismo tiempo abusa del realismo m\u00e1gico para no comprometerse con un final y \u00e9ste ser\u00eda el gran defecto/virtud de una pel\u00edcula ambig\u00fca.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu produce, escribe y dirige \u00e9sta cinta apoyado de un gran equipo t\u00e9cnico al mando de su compatriota Emmanuel Lubezki. Tal como Riggan tiene su alterego y competencia en Birdman, el director lo tiene en su cinemat\u00f3grafo pues viendo la pel\u00edcula es dif\u00edcil sabe a quien atribuir sus m\u00e9ritos.\n\nT\u00e9cnicamente \u00e9sta pel\u00edcula es m\u00e1s compleja que cualquiera de efectos especiales de \u00e9ste a\u00f1o. La c\u00e1mara sigue a los actores en una aparente toma continua en un delirio y pesadilla de coordinaci\u00f3n. La t\u00e1ctica nos contagia de la intensidad narrativa que, adem\u00e1s, es en algunas secuencias musicalizada con una bater\u00eda de jazz que parece improvisar (coordinar eso es otro m\u00e9rito, pues en algunas tomas vemos al baterista). A\u00fan as\u00ed se mantiene una est\u00e9tica visual extraordinaria, un impecable manejo de enfoque y luces, para retratar la miseria detr\u00e1s de bambalinas.\n\nMichael Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Lindsay Duncan, Andrea Risenborough y Emma Stone se lucen en las interpretaciones, el gui\u00f3n honra a los actores y ellos a sus personajes, a\u00fan cuando sus historias queden inconclusas.\n\nLos m\u00e9ritos de \"Birdman\", como su intensidad, ser\u00e1n motivo de que algunos la rechacen: El filme es pesado y duro de digerir, por ello algunos lo alabar\u00e1n y otros no. A medio camino entre el arte y lo comercial, se anota como candidato a candidaturas del Oscar.",

            "content": "Excelente como pel\u00edcula de arte, p\u00e9sima pel\u00edcula comercial.\nCon anterioridad he comprobado que los Oscares son una forma de hacer comerciales las pel\u00edculas de arte y Birdman no es la excepci\u00f3n. Es una excelente pel\u00edcula porque est\u00e1 filmada de manera que no se notan mucho los cortes de edici\u00f3n como si fuera una sola secuencia, salvo dos cortes y transiciones que s\u00ed tiene. Pareciera que es un solo tiempo cuando la misma trama nos va revelando que las transiciones est\u00e1n hechas por la misma secuencia de la c\u00e1mara. Es una excelente cinta, sin duda, para los cineastas, por eso no me extra\u00f1\u00f3 que los frikis y otras personas no muy allegadas al cine la vieran como aburrida o que los fanboys del cine la vieran de tal o cual forma sin fijarse en qu\u00e9 era lo que en realidad simbolizaba la pel\u00edcula.\nAl igual como comentaron con la pel\u00edcula de la vida de Hawkings, esta tampoco se escapa de un checklist obligatorio para hacerla ganadora. Uno de estos elementos es el retomar propuestas cinematogr\u00e1ficas de diferentes directores como David Lynch, Gaspar No\u00e9, Christopher Nolan, Woody Allen (en las partes de la comedia, porque es una especie de humor negro), David Fincher y otros tantos m\u00e1s que se me escapan.\nHay tantos matices en Birdman que es muy dif\u00edcil que se puedan englobar en un solo art\u00edculo de una cr\u00edtica. Es por eso que mejor me voy a saltar toda la paja y decir que si no se le entendi\u00f3 a Birdman o se le encasill\u00f3 solo como una cr\u00edtica al teatro, como una cr\u00edtica a la cr\u00edtica del cine y del teatro, como una cr\u00edtica a Hollywood o como simplemente una propuesta m\u00e1s de cine, entonces no se entendi\u00f3 Birdman. Birdman son muchas historias en una sola. Son muchos elementos que se deben admirar y al mismo tiempo aburren al cin\u00e9filo. No es una pel\u00edcula hecha para cualquier p\u00fablico pero eso no quita que no se le de una buena calificaci\u00f3n. Cualquiera que sabe de cine, al menos un poco, como este humilde servidor podr\u00e1 detectar por qu\u00e9 le gust\u00f3 tanto a la academia al grado de darle los premios que se gan\u00f3. Y sin duda, eso merece un gran aplauso de pie para I\u00f1arritu.",

Aesthetically it feels like you're watching a production because everything is go, go, go, go, go 100% of the time and I love that it's almost like a revolving door.  We get to see characters here and there talking with one another in standout selections and then its right back into the chaos.  Michael Keaton's performance is wonderful:  tragic, funny, likeable Keaton pulls out all of the stops for this performance.  The surrounding cast is also fantastic whether it's Emma Stone playing the drug addict daughter with the foul mouth but has the heart of gold, or Edward Norton as the asshole actor who is the \"real\" actor not the \"fake\" actor like people in movies.  The music is also wonderful, I loved the jazz soundtrack, it kept the film moving at a break neck pace the entire time.  With all of that said, I can see why Hollywood chose it as Best Movie of the Year because it fits in line with what they were trying to say at this years Oscars.  Those big budget movies with special effects galore and explosions...aren't movies.  They're not filled with actors they're filled with celebrities.  It's a very pretentious statement to make but they made it loud and clear and Birdman symbolizes that.  Keaton's character only wants to be taken seriously as an actor, he wants to put on this stage production, he's trying to change who he is in the face of the public which ultmately is why people don't like him because it's not as much about the work that he's doing, because no matter how serious he is about doing something...it's always about his image.  He is the star, he is the director, and he wants to be known for something other than Birdman.  The film makes a lot of statements about the industry and its awesome that they got Keaton to play the part because it adds a whole other meta layer to the film that it might not have had, had it gotten someone else to play the part which in itself is kind of ironic seeing as how the film is about people who normally wouldn't get the part because of someone with celebrity status like Keaton getting the part.  Birdman is an awesome film--funny, smart, fast, and ultimately tragic.  I highly recommend it.",

There are so many moving parts to this plot that interweave reality and the film it is hard to list them, or indeed perceive them.\n\nTwo characters, Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, and Mike played by Edward Norton, carry the film from beginning to end. You might be tempted to see Keaton as a man trying to regain his former glory by pulling this serious play off; but in fact he is a man who views his prior roles as Birdman as a sell out for easy money. Faced with the choice of recreating his earlier Birdman role, or showing the world that he can create and perform something that is indeed both serious and witty, he chooses the latter. Riggan sums it all up in one line: \"I want to matter\". Mike is both his last minute only hope to pull it all off, and his constant pain-in-the-ass, any second catastrophic failure figure.\n\nIf you like constant action with car chase scenes, real bullets flying, and bare breasts bouncing with intermittent sobbing from broken hearted women, then this is not the movie for you.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to see a movie with a real plot, edgy directing and sharp dialog, then see it - - and pay attention! Not for the masses of today's audiences, and for a change a great movie without sub-titles.",

I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is a freak genius, making so many celebrated directors pale before him. The entire film and all involved were miraculous. Michael Keaton was pretty much robbed of an Oscar. I've never seen a more moving and riveting performance. Real tears just drop from his eyes; not those fake drops or fake tearless sobs. I feel honored to have met him 5 years ago at a funeral in Los Angeles. I never realized I was in the presence of such a great actor. What an extraordinary and beautiful film for him to throw himself into. If you haven't yet seen this film, you must see it. Do NOT heed a single negative audience review. They are wrong. This is a perfect film from beginning to end, with the most unique script and style possible. Thank the gods Boyhood did not win the Oscar over this because I would have died of shock.

            "content": "Batman, Interrupted\n\n Bringing so many award nominations that if it doesn't win something will quite literally brake; it is Birdman! So I suppose the reel question is, will this... I don't know what it is really, a drama? A thriller? Comedy? Some kind of psychological warfare?.... Let's just start the review...\n\nPretentious, that's a word that is used far to lightly now a days, you can be pretentious for almost anything, but no matter what you think about Birdman it is pretentious, and I kind a think the film knows it. As if the entire idea is some kind of massive joke that the audience isn't part of but everyone else is. Birdman feels like a joke that starts off strong, like a one liner but never quite gets round to delivering the punchline.\n\n I'll admit it here and now Birdman is not an easy film to watch, or to enjoy. You have to really put the effort in to love it and it's so easy to fall by the wayside. Here are just a few of the really obvious issues you have to get over to enjoy Birdman properly. The shooting style, is it at best bewildering and worst totally unwatchable, as is the musical score which seems to take the format of unorganized drum solo's (As if Rick Allen has gone off on one), the way most of the characters are played can be either phenomenal or grinding, and actually the entire premise of the movie and sureness of the story with both one foot in reality and one foot in fantasy leaves us with many, many elements never explained. Actually that could be the biggest setback of al;, it's own self. But, if can get past all that, something really quite amazing happens.\n\n If you can get past all of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu ( the writer and director) obstacles you discover one of the greatest pieces of cinema possibly ever made. Birdman is unique in just about every way that matters, every single member of the cast give career defining performances (even the lesser roles make the effort), and each twist and turn the plot takes gives us a deeper understanding of the pure insanity that is locked within Riggen's head. \n\n Birdman isn't really a film at all; Birdman is a moving work of art. That's the truth of it. You can take any one single character or element of the film and justify it as art. I'll prove it by doing just that. The score for the film is irratic but it's timing is perfect, it throws us out of the context of the film like a signpost to the inner rhythm of Riggen's brain. Lets all consider that for a moment. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu has created a film that is so close to a characters thinking we can literally hear the beat of his brain. We know the film is set inside Riggen's head because he is the only inner monologue voice we hear for the duration of the movie. \n\n The entire film comes together for one single sequence when Riggen gets locked out of the theatre that he is appearing in. That sequence is pure art, from start to finish it is a perfectly observed and presented piece of art, every element and thread of the movie comes together for that sequence and then it all starts to disintegrate again. Pure genius.\n\n To comment on Birdman now is almost unfair of me to do, I feel like it's too soon. Birdman is the sort of film you need to look at 20 or 30 years from now and see how much it has impacted the further films after it. It's THAT kind of movie.\n\n The directing for Birdman is so bold that it can barely be described, technically the film is a masterpiece without doubt. The entire movie is in one shot and instead of getting cuts we just follow different characters as they enter and leave scenes, but the amount of space that is shown is at times incredible. \n\n I feel like I'm stating the obvious if I say anything at all about the cast here, but it feels like this is the role Michael Keaton has been waiting his entire life to play. His voice is like silk blended with gravel. In honesty I could write an entire new review on Keaton's performance alone. \n\n Birdman is as close a study into insanity as I have ever witnessed, it's a film that is about everything at once, and is directed within an inch of it's own life, it's a love it or hate it movie and I don't hate it.",

To say that this film is a masterpiece goes beyond how I feel about it. It's one of the most compelling and perfect films that has come out in the last twenty years. Of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's previous work, I had only seen Babel, which I didn't care that much for. So when it was announced that he was making a film with Michael Keaton, I didn't give it much thought, despite how much I like Michael Keaton as an actor, Batman films aside. Once I started hearing the rumblings about Birdman and how it was going to change Michael Keaton's life around, I knew it was a film that I was just going to have to see, and now that I have, I wish I had seen it sooner. In my mind, Birdman is perfect. There's just no other way to describe it than that. It's not a gimmick movie, it's not a pretentious or philosophical movie, nor is it a special effects movie. It's none of those things. It doesn't merely tell the story of a washed-up actor trying to make it in the theater because he has nothing else left. It's also about all of the people working in show business and how their lives can become affected over time, in the good and the bad. It's a father/daughter story, a jilted lover story, a lost friend story, a disappointing life story... it's a lot of things. It also never gets overly melodramatic. It has the perfect blend of humor and pathos. But above all else, Michael Keaton is 100% amazing in it. If nothing else, see it for his performance and be reminded of what an amazing actor he is and always has been.",

Think of Birdman as Batman, and Keaton as his washed up self putting everything he has into a Broadway play - attempting a comeback into fame.  Edward Norton plays the hated impudent lead actor (in his play) who clashes with Keaton throughout most of the film.

Accompanied by the main character of his box office film series, Michael Keaton desperately grapples with his need for importance and relevance in society by transforming from an action packed, slow-fastball-down-the-middle, easy home run type actor to a multi-dimensional, emotionally complex broadway performer. Underlying this desire to further prove his worth to society, and more importantly, himself, are the fruits of his past: a detached daughter, a broken love, and an intense anger problem. \n\nBursts of satirical comedy accompanied by Keaton's battle with the human desire for approval yields a great story that has the capability to trigger a real emotional response.",

While it is hard to tell if he's acting or not, he is made into a frustrating character who can barely keep it in his pants in some scenes. However, he does improve.\n2) The fact that 'not a whole lot happens'. My parents blamed this film for that, and I still can't get over the fact they consider it a bad movie.\n\nTo be fair, the central figure of Riggan, the film being made as if it were in one shot, and the fact that it actually can sum up a Michael Bay film in only a few minutes. It is a black comedy that is executed much better than expected, with only two minor errors that don't really affect the movie at all.",

            "content": "Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is a washed-up Hollywood actor famous for playing the superhero Birdman in blockbuster movies decades earlier. Riggan is tormented by the voice of Birdman, who mercilessly criticizes him, and he sees himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan hopes to reinvent his career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". The play is produced by Riggan's best friend and lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis), and also stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and first-time Broadway actress Lesley (Naomi Watts). Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a recovering addict, serves as his assistant. During rehearsals, a light fixture falls onto Ralph, an actor Riggan and Jake agree is terrible; Riggan tells Jake he caused the light to fall so he could replace Ralph. Through a connection with Lesley, Riggan replaces Ralph with the brilliant but volatile method actor Mike (Edward Norton), refinancing his house to fund his contract. The first previews go disastrously: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, and attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene. Riggan reads early press coverage and is incensed that Mike has stolen the attention, but Jake encourages him to continue. Riggan needs to find a way to keep the play together and himself as well...\n\nAside from a few shots near the beginning and end, Birdman appears to be filmed in a single shot (The concept of shooting a feature-length film in one, continuous take was actually accomplished twelve years before Birdman's release in the film \"Russian Ark\" (2002), which was shot in a single 96-minute Steadicam sequence.), an idea the director had since the film's conception. This required an atypical production approach, with many elements of post-production needing to be considered before principal photography. As a result the script took two years to write, the cast went through several weeks of meticulous rehearsals, and during shooting takes were cut for the slightest mishaps. The film was written using a dramatic device similar to Magical Realism - Magic realism or magical realism is a genre where magical or unreal elements play a natural part in an otherwise realistic (often mundane) environment. Although it is most commonly used as a literary genre (mostly during the Latin American \"boom\" generation, which includes Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Carlos Fuentes amongst many others), magic realism also applies to film and the visual arts.It was filmed in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million, jointly financed by New Regency and Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival. \"Birdman\" was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14. The film has grossed more than $86 million worldwide. It has garnered critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed to the cast's performances, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's direction, editing, screenplay, and cinematography. It is widely considered to be one of the best films of 2014, and has received multiple awards and nominations. Birdman won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Director for I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography, and also receiving five additional nominations, tying it with The Grand Budapest Hotel for the most awards and nominations at the year's ceremony. It also won the Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Screenplay and Best Actor at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is a great director with some truly fantastic films on his CV and I reckon we all raised an eyebrow when he took upon himself to do the project \"Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" as this is pretty far from his usual style and art form. First of all I love the camera work which depicts most of the film as one continuous take and I can only imagine how difficult that is to make that happen so it looks good and believable. The idea of having a self aware showbiz satire as the foundation is not new, but it\u00b4s how you actually handle the topic that makes it interesting. And I\u00f1\u00e1rritu puts everything in it. I have been a fan of Michael Keaton since \"Beetlejuice\" and I love that he gets to show his full range yet again in a movie that will propel him into the industry yet again with good roles at hand. And I reckon you can\u00b4t get away from   the fact that the role is close to his own life and his stint as Batman. He is magnificent as Riggan Thomson in \"Birdman\" and I do think he should\u00b4ve won the Oscar for this role. I\u00b4m on your side Michael. Edward Norton is great as well together with Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis and the lovely Emma Stone. In the midst of all the black comedy and pointed fingers at what it means to be a celebrity with the good sides and the bad sides that comes with it, my personal problem with \"Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" is the feeling of this being an \"invite only\" show for the people on the inside and not for us outside of the entertainment industry. I didn\u00b4t feel invited by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu while he was dissecting all the ugly sides of the industry in his personal laboratory making the movie also feeling a bit self-important and pompous on the side. This does however not drag down the movie and the experience.",

First off, Michael Keaton DID do a good job as Riggan Thompson. He had some funny lines and he gave a good performance. What I didn't understand was why Edward Norton got so much praise. He's a good actor and I have nothing against the guy personally, I just didn't see what was so great about his performance. Yeah sure, he got butt naked in front of Naomi Watts and Emma Stone, big deal. I guess just after hearing so many times from friends that Edward Norton should have gotten Best Supporting Actor, I was a bit too overhyped. The one part of the movie that I loved was Zach Galifianakis. Although he wasn't in the film for long, he stole every scene he was in. I did like the \"Birdman\" voice talking to Riggan throughout the film. I liked those scenes the best. Plus the dream sequence where the Birdman starts following him in the street and where Riggan flies around the city was a pretty neat scene. Overall, I liked the movie. I just didn't see a masterpiece like some other people did. If you love this movie, that's great! More power to you! But out of the other Best Picture nominees, I preferred American Sniper, Boyhood, The Imitation Game, Selma, & Whiplash.",

The only reason I can find that someone might not to like this film is that it would be strange and confusing if you view the film literally rather than understanding that some of it depicts internal events rather than external ones.

I do not consider myself a critic,  I'm just some nerd who likes movies, so I'm not the type of person to sit down and care about nothing but the character development, and themes,  but this movie did both so well I did care about both.  All of the characters have layers and layers on them,  Emma Stone isn't just some dumb teen,  she plays a teen struggling to connect with her Dad,  she has addiction problems,  she wants to be relevant,  she wants to help others,  but struggles to help herself.  Edward Norton is not just some jerk who only cares about his preformance, he is also struggling to find a way to feel alive,  to live life,  but life won't give him a break.  They are all real characters,  and the movie expects you to know that.  It never spoonfeeds you info,  you have to make your own connections,  you have to figure out what is happening,  why people are the way they are in the movie,  so it kind of pisses me off when someone puts a review saying that it made no sense,  because it's not the movies fault that you can't put 2 and 2 together,  that's your fault for being too dumb to be able too.",

            "content": "~ Birdman ~\n(a review of the film)\n\nThis is a film primarily about Hollywood's action-film excesses, and what is or isn't real to the audience and the actors. If that were the extent of it, then I'd probably love the film. But, unfortunately, that worthy theme is mixed with a very sad tale of mental illness, and it's all laced with some very funny comedy too, including a drum beat in the background that seems to be there for comic relief. It all makes for a very odd cocktail and it left me scratching my head.\nLikes: Keaton, Norton, and many other very fine performers; an effective motif of continuity; some *extremely* clever editing tricks, e.g. on several occasions, the camera seems to somehow squeeze through the bars of a window; and a very snappy, tight script that is expertly delivered by all.\nDislikes: obviously, my biggest dislike is the rather casual treatment of mental illness... is it really okay to mix laugh-out-loud humor with a plot that traces the predictable breakdown of a schizophrenic? This tale is way more serious than, for example, the film about Walter Mitty, who came across as whimsical. Here, Keaton's character is in rapid decline You know it right from the start, and you probably guess the ending right from the start too (I did). Surely the entire audience anticipates what Keaton's character will do when it's all \"for real\"... and on several occasions we're actually surprised that it goes on a bit longer.\nFellow photogeeks will note that on several occasions, the movie reverts from film to digital. E.g. when Norton joins a female supporting character on a balcony, the film quality is completely lost and the scene looks like it's shot on a handy cam. Why? I found that very disruptive to the story line...it broke the implied continuity. Maybe that was the intention? Odd.\nOn the whole, I do recommend seeing this, but it's *definitely* not for kids- don't mistake the overarching action-hero theme as light entertainment. It's an adult film. And, fair warning: if you know anything about mental illness then it may not sit well with you at all.",

I could have done without Riggan's psychosis about his super-hero status. And, we get it, actors and actresses are prima donnas who like to bask in their faults. Also, maybe this is just me, but too much yelling and psychological pain. I was grateful whenever his ex-wife was in a scene because she was the only character I liked in the whole movie (and, arguably, though not a  household name, Amy Ryan may be the most versatile actor of the star-studded cast). I realize that we were not supposed to like them, but, there's a way to make even the seemingly unlikeable likeable. One more thing - I don't care what they say, this was not a black comedy. It was just a dark movie in which I'm not sure I laughed once. Laugh at what - that he got caught outside in his underwear - it was sad, not funny? The third star is for the technical work.",

I was stunned to read that news, and not have seen the film, so I figured the academy usually is at least a little right in their decisions, so I went out and bought a copy, which is not something I usually do.  Anyway, this was a good movie, borderlining on great. Its a tad hard to express emotion about it. Things I liked were the single sort of unedited one shot style, I thought that was extremely impressive because not enough movies even attempt to make that happen. As a musician and primarily a drummer, I appreciated the use of the free range jazzy drum beats for a majority of the interlude music. I also like the plot, how you see pieces of this play here and there in that single shot style and have Michael Keaton battling his inner voice of Birdman, and that they leave the thought of him having actual powers ambiguous until the very end of the film, and you never really find out.  Edward Norton and Zach G. and Emma Stone were all pretty fantastic in their roles. There were a few pieces of dry plot here and there, but ultimately entertaining and weird. So I guess I can say, money well spent. 4/5",

Slightly confusing at first but once you get it with the continuous shots and the elapse of time it is like watching a dream.  In a dream you go from one situation to another without cuts or subtitles telling you elapsed time.  Following Riggan we can see how he battles himself to be a respected actor.  Knowing the West/East coast battles of Broadway and Hollywood adds tension to the story.  I haven't seen an entire film that is like one continuous shot since that Russian film that I can't remember.  Everyone is at their best.  Keaton is good in anything so his versatility is well established, Edward Norton is always good, if anyone remembers his first film with Richard Gere where he was nominated for best supporting actor, this is no surprise.  The big surprise for me was Zach Galifinakis, he wasn't a weird funny type guy in this which is his bread and butter.  He played a human being very well.  I am happy to say that the Academy got it's head out of it's own Butt and actually gave the Oscar to the best picture of the year with this one.

Michael Keaton gets full credit for holding the entire thing together and fully deserves every award he wins for his performance.  Birdman takes plenty of shots at the superhero genre, and Hollywood in general, but none of it would work without Keaton's meta-casting.  The supporting cast is impressive, but none of the characters get much development or resolution.  Birdman also gets in the bad habit of playing the \"is it real, or in his imagination?\" card one too many times.  Leaving it up to the audience's imagination is a great thing for filmmakers to do, but here it kinda comes off as lazy writing and doesn't add much to the movie.

Staging a Broadway play seems to be his last ditch effort to feel remembered and relevant again but it seems to come with a cost. The cost being a combination of colliding egos (both within and outside of himself), a daughter who loathes him and the risks one must take to stay in the lime light just long enough to feel famous again.

The main thing that brings it over the top is the camerawork: With few exceptions, the movie is designed to look like it was shot all in one take. One scene flawlessly segues into the next by the camera following characters who only briefly appear in the previous scene. It's quite a ballet.\n\nHow's the actual story though? It's pretty good. It's about an aging actor trying to perform a theater play to make his comeback. The ensemble cast really makes this-specifically Emma Stone and Naomi Wattts. I wasn't really so much struck by Keaton's story but the ensemble cast carries it. The latter half suffers a bit because it focuses mostly on Keaton and forgets a lot of the supporting characters, but most threads do wrap up nicely. It's a good movie.",

Keaton as Riggan hires Mike played by Edward Norton in the hope of getting the play off the ground, but with Mike being an actor in the theater and Riggan coming from Hollywood-egos quickly clash between the two and to make matters worse, Riggan runs into a theater critic from the New York Times who simply will not give Riggan credit for risking what he was into what he wants to be. This leads to the back and forth battle between Riggan and 'The Birdman'-of whom he can only see. On top of all of this, Riggan is attempting to get back in the good graces with his daughter played wonderfully with passion by Emma Stone.\n\nThe takeaway from this movie is still a question and not really sure that by the end of ''BIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' that anything was resolved but that might actually be the genus (or madness) of this movie. 'BIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' won the Oscar for Best Movie of the Year and can be debated but love it, hate it, like it, or unsure what to think of it-'BIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' is a movie that has its place in movie lure and under all of the oddness and yep, I'll say it, like a drug trip with Keaton talking to himself and trashing his dressing room with a flick of his hand-'BIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' invites the audience to take a ride with Riggan as he attempts to find himself and comes to terms with who he is.",

Although I did enjoy the film it rattles me to the core what is considered a great film in the eyes of people in this generation. I sense a message coming from this movie that says todays big Hollywood hits, mainly comic book superhero films, are nothing more then big flashy expensive productions that is not real art, and does not represent good creativity in the movie making industry. At times to me it bathes in its own self-righteousness all while maintaining its central theme of suicide. I swear that this movie couldn't go ten minutes without referencing suicide in some way shape or form. At some points you actually start to believe that Keaton's character will abandon his selfish desires for the betterment of his families needs, but in the end chooses to end his own life in an attempt to show everyone that he is in fact \"somebody\" and not just a washed up Superhero actor. It even tries to convince us that in this act he is taking some sort of admirable approach to his dying career. Going out with a bang fashion. It upsets me that they mock films that inspire us to do good, and try to show us morals even when we doubt ourselves. Films that teach us real courage and sacrifice for the better of mankind, such as the Dark Knight trilogy, are considered less creative, and not deemed real art while films that teach us to ignore loved ones for selfish desires, and that suicide is a reasonable and honorable approach to failure are widely and critically acclaimed. My opinion of what true art is seeing something that you did not think was possible coming to life in front of your eyes. I get that from films such as the Avengers or Man of Steel. Those movies are the reason I go to the theatre, to see something spectacular come to life that I have never seen before. This movie is nothing more to me then a carbon copy of all other films that show us the inside of a mentally unstable characters mind, and we get to witness his depressing fall into madness only to try to shock us and disgust us with what actions this madness makes them do. Making people try to guess what atrocious horrible action this character is going to next approach to film making is not art to me. It is my hope that great films like the ones Marvel studios puts out, and hopefully DC soon, will get the same recognition and awards that these films about crazy people doing crazy things do. Unfortunately I don't see this happening anytime soon. It was a good movie, but deserving Best Picture of the year I do not agree at all.",

It's hard to describe because it is a highly peculiar movie. What I'll say first is that I am not in the club of people who praise this film as one of the best ever, however there are plenty of attributes that deserve applause. For starters, who's ever idea it was to blend and edit all the shots in the movie to make it look like one consecutive take is brilliant. It added an entirely new spin to the movie that is something I've never seen before and makes me appreciate the movie more than I would have otherwise. Another aspect of the film worth recognition is the spectacular script that is carried perfectly by the actors. The dialogue is quick witted and always ahead of the audience which also adds to the play-like dynamic of the film. The surrealism is a large part of the movie and almost feels out of place although it manages to work. It factors into the protagonists' struggles and morals as he decides who he is and his meaning toward society. Without going into detail and avoiding spoilers, there is a \"Christopher Nolan\" type cliffhanger ending that lets the audience speculate which direction the director wants this story to end. In my opinion, this movie is not that type of movie and almost seems like it was thrown in there for the hell of it. I would have preferred  a more complete and finalizing ending for this movie and protagonist.",

Finding where the shots have been joined, however, can at times distract from the emotional journey crafted by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and his team of writers, in a script full of dark humour and irony. Unfortunately there's also a hint of pretension and self-satisfaction in I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's work - intentional and otherwise - that comes across as smug and, therefore, annoying. As Riggan Thomson, the former A-lister seeking professional rejuvenation on the stage, Michael Keaton gets a long- awaited opportunity to shine in a lead role and attacks it, for better and worse, with unbridled gusto. Ed Norton hogs the spotlight though, with a comedic turn as a supercilious stage actor looking for the \"truth\" in even the tiniest of things, whilst Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan round out the impressive cast. Birdman is clever, enterprising and admirably distinct, if occasionally laborious and inaccessible; it's not for everyone, but lovers of film and/or theatre should seek it out.",

It is a self-indulgent tribute to the self-absorbed profession of acting. It stars Michael Keaton (ironically, as the former star of the fictional \"Birdman\" comic book movies), who's now desperately trying to revive his stalled career on Broadway. There is much about this movie that is loathesome - its pretentiousness, its over-acting and its recurring bait-and-switch phoniness; but ultimately, all that awfulness results in a pretty innovative film about our obsession with celebrity. Birdman is not the best film of 2014 but it is thought provoking and unique, which earns it a B+",

Michael Keaton is superb somehow keeping up the pace with both the real and imaginary characters despite the constant assault by all. Until the first edit you are confined to one block on Broadway mostly inside an old dilapidated theatre. Maybe if you are from NY you know the significance and that lends more weight to the performance.

Their honesty and raw emotion set the tone and pace beautifully. Norton, in particular, brought an electric energy to the picture. \n\nThe film is layered in every way, ambitiously taking on themes such as: what is art? What are the risks of an artist? How does Hollywood really compare to the stage? What is the nature of reality? How do you escape past success to redefine who you are? Who does that really matter to? And many, many more. \n\nBirdman is unabashed in its answers to these questions, running the gauntlet of emotion to delve every ounce of meaning from every frame on screen. The cinematography and editing were both masterworks, boasting a nearly seamless long shot of the entire 2 hour film. \n\nAdding to the layers, the film often goes completely meta, with things like being able to see the source of the music in the film and Keaton's character acting as both director of his play and, at times, his life. Despite the seeming lack of cuts, there's still plenty of highly stylized moments which often raise more questions than they answer. \n\nBirdman, overall, was a thinking movie with great acting that had great ambitions. Though, its worst sin is that it didn't go far enough in any of its many directions to truly create a masterpiece. \n\nStill, watching it try is a great ride.",

With Riggan's success in finally achieving what he wants in life (a nod to the opening card), his daughter looks down in horror, then up in delight--acknowledgment that he has left Birdman behind and is finally a person of self-significance and worth.

Much has been made of the technical accomplishment of long sequences filmed without obvious cuts - but so what? what does this add to what the film is trying to say? what is it trying to say exactly? it seems very confused about this. early on we are given the impression that the birdman really has supernatural powers - to move objects for instance. Then we learn that these are probably in his mind, Then a CGI sequence persuades us that he can fly. Then it appears he can't because having landed he has to pay the taxi driver. Then he;s in hospital and fantasises about flying with the birds. Then his daughter arrives and thinks he's jumped and fallen to his death - and then she looks up in wonderment. So - can he fly? Who knows? Do we care? Absolutely not? And what is the point? Not a fucking clue. On the plus side Emma Stone is terrific as the daughter. The one truly believable character in  the whole film.",

Time, sound, and editing also create elements of magical realism and reflect the mind of Riggan.\n\nThere are a couple things I did not appreciate very much, including sexism that is played for humor and a titillating kiss that doesn't make much sense to me and adds to the undercurrent of sexism.

It takes balls to be aware of it and turn it into a quirky comedy that at the same time is constantly throwing knives at the movie industry.

            "content": "Birdman tells the story of seasoned actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) who is preparing for the opening night of his first Broadway play. He's best known for his starring role of superhero Birdman decades earlier and is in quite a bit of a personal crisis. He wants nothing but recognition for his professional accomplishments and he wants his new project to be a success.\n\nIn Birdman, we're dropped right into the backstage drama leading up to the play's opening night. We see several people connected to the play as well as Thomson's daughter/assistant Sam (Emma Stone). We also get the idea that the Birdman character invaded Thomson's psyche and the tragic lead of this story doesn't experience reality in is head as we observe it.\n\nPossibly interesting only to theatre production people, the drama is quite dull and predictable, giving the audience time to pay attention to the fact that director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is playing games with time and space in this movie. Those games are executed to a T, with props going to Emmanuel Lubezki, the cinematographer, and Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione for their superb job at editing these scenes.\n\nThese technical accomplishments of making the movie look like it's one long take instead of connected scenes overshadow the actual story and acting here. Sure, Keaton does a good job with the troubled Thomson. And when Edward Norton enters as co-star Mike, the intensity sure picks up a bit. But after almost two hours of this story, I am left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the actual content of the narrative and characters. And annoyed by the pseudo-artsy-fartsy drum soundtrack. If you'd look up 'style over substance' in a 2015 illustrated dictionary, you'd find this movie.\n\nDon't be fooled by reviews claiming it to be the greatest work of art in filmmaking in decades. There's quite a few people jumping on the chance to showcase their love and admiration for this film in an online movie review. I get the feeling most critics do it so as to not lose face with their peers. There's even a hint of \"let's write this is the best movie ever made, because if I don't, I'll be considered a neanderthal who doesn't understand art.\"\n\nLet's get one thing straight: the production value is excellent. Unfortunately, the story and characters are severely underwhelming. If this takes 'best picture' at the Academy Awards, it will be a crying shame.\n\nPros: Great production value, excellent editing and OK performances\nCons: Style over substance at every level\n\nVerdict: Meh",

The story line related to the fragility and arrogance of actors was lost on me because it was self-indulgent.  I get that it was supposed to be that way so that's a success just unpleasant and stereotypical.  It's too cynical except the one scene were the main character is helped down from the ledge (figuratively and literally) by someone with genuine compassion.

I don't care about Riggan's past or future - the single-take shot scenes anchor you so supremely in his present moment yet the majority of the conflict in the film is propelled by events you never witness. And so we're invited to attach a popular meta-narrative of other films and real life personas too (perhaps it would have been better to go the whole Being John Malkovich route and just reference Batman directly). \n\nEdward Norton is fantastic and then squandered upon clich\u00e9.\n\nMy favourite scene is when Norton first comes on stage to workshop a scene. The anatomy of this is really basic: 1) Riggan commits a basic writing crime (redundant dialogue), 2) Mike fixes this error; but the execution is so perfect. Too bad nothing really tops this exchange making many subsequent scenes just appear as self-parodies. \n\nThe personal conflict does not motivate the best sequences, instead the mere accident of locking oneself outside a one-way door is the trigger and so the resolution of this conflict fails to really connect with anything deeper - while being wildly entertaining.\n\nThe end is crap. At least in Ghostworld, when the main character departs the reality or world of the film, this potential had long been foreshadowed and built up - here it's just confusing. Why doesn't Riggan want the magical success he's just been granted? Why was his surgery so neat? Was the performance really so good it could change the spiteful critic's bias against him?

Escondido por detr\u00e1s da premissa envolvendo um ator outrora famoso por viver um super-her\u00f3i, no caso o 'homem-p\u00e1ssaro' do t\u00edtulo, que sofre para se manter relevante ap\u00f3s n\u00e3o fazer a sequ\u00eancia do longa h\u00e1 20 anos atr\u00e1s, o filme parece ser mais 'normal' do que realmente \u00e9.\n\nMergulhado em um diferente conceito de ser filmado para dar a impress\u00e3o de que foi feito sem cortes, o que evidentemente n\u00e3o passa de uma simula\u00e7\u00e3o, dado o fato de ser uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o cinematogr\u00e1fica de algumas horas de dura\u00e7\u00e3o, e complementado por uma trilha sonora composta, em sua maior parte, apenas por uma bateria, Birdman demora um pouco para nos fazer adentrar em sua trama.\n\nUma vez imersos, entretanto, o filme se torna um maravilhoso ode ao teatro. O filme se passa nos bastidores de uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o teatral, nos apresentando de forma curiosa \u00e0s suas mais variadas vertentes. H\u00e1 acidentes, sa\u00eddas de roteiro, pessoas \u00e0 beira de uma crise de nervos, visitas da imprensa, e at\u00e9 mesmo desentendimentos entre os atores, tudo envolto neste conceito de que h\u00e1 algu\u00e9m perseguindo os personagens o tempo todo pelos palcos, corredores e at\u00e9 pelas ruas.\n\nO filme todo se desenvolve basicamente no mesmo cen\u00e1rio, um teatro de Nova Iorque, o que igualmente ajuda a dar aquela caracter\u00edstica ainda mais teatral ao projeto. E como uma boa pe\u00e7a, o componente essencial \u00e9 a atua\u00e7\u00e3o dos atores, e n\u00e3o deleites visuais que distraiam da hist\u00f3ria e seus personagens.\n\nAssim, Michael Keaton brilha como o atormentado Riggan Thomson, atuando basicamente como si mesmo. E a ironia de que Keaton igualmente fez fama h\u00e1 20 anos quando viveu o personagem Batman nas telonas, apenas refor\u00e7a o efeito metalingu\u00edstico. Ao contr\u00e1rio de seus colegas indicados ao Oscar de Melhor Ator, que ou interpretam pessoas reais, ou contam com artif\u00edcios como dramas exagerados, Keaton foca sua atua\u00e7\u00e3o dentro da alma do pr\u00f3prio personagem, salientando que tudo se passa dentro da pr\u00f3pria perspectiva de Riggan. As ang\u00fastias, d\u00favidas, e alegrias do personagem s\u00e3o meramente naturais, e conferem um peso muito maior \u00e0 sua atua\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nEdward Norton, ent\u00e3o, se sai extraordinariamente bem, no que talvez seja seu melhor papel em anos. Emma Stone, com seus grandes olhos, sempre se sai encantadora. E at\u00e9 mesmo Zach Galifianakis, nitidamente mais magro, consegue nos surpreender em um papel mais s\u00e9rio. Eu n\u00e3o acreditava que ele fosse capaz de fazer qualquer coisa sem encarnar a aura amalucada do Alan de Se Beber N\u00e3o Case.\n\nTrazendo ainda uma hist\u00f3ria que pode gerar entendimentos amb\u00edguos, Birdman honra a si mesmo com efeitos especiais divertidos e pouco usuais em momentos chaves, deixando os espectadores ainda mais surpresos quando a trama larga um pouco o teatro para focar quase que exclusivamente em Riggan.\n\nSem d\u00favida, Birdman talvez seja o filme que mais divide opini\u00f5es dentre os v\u00e1rios indicados ao Oscar de Melhor Filme de 2015. E gerar debates nunca \u00e9 ruim. Principalmente para o cinema, que vem optando por escolhas cada vez mais f\u00e1ceis e certeiras nos \u00faltimos anos, adaptando livros popularescos e hist\u00f3rias em quadrinhos como se fossem requisitos infal\u00edveis para se arrastar multid\u00f5es \u00e0s salas de cinema. E at\u00e9 isto \u00e9 debatido em Birdman, numa amalgama metalinguagem extremamente perspicaz. \n\nTalvez n\u00e3o ser f\u00e1cil seja uma qualidade, afinal de contas.",

On his journey of redemption he tries to escape his past, stay releveant and not be remembered as being Birdman. On the journey we see parallels with the real film industry: the critics being the only option that matters, celebrities who feel loved but in reality are admired, not being able to separate reality with acting and one actors fame causing him to overstep others. In the end which can be interpreted many ways, Keaton realizes he cannot escape Birdman and just accepts it. Just like Christian Bale will always be Batman and Robert Downey Jr will be Ironman.",

            "content": "Basic: So, Birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance, Riggan Thompson (played by Micheal Keaton) is a washed-up actor, he's been famous for playing the character, Birdman, and now he's trying to redeem himself by doing an adaptation of a novel, by not in a movie, but in a play. He's also trying to get his family back together. Amy Ryan's character wants Micheal Keaton's character, Riggan to spend more time with her daughter, Sam (played by Emma Stone), after she got back from rehab for all the drugs she's been doing. Well, in fact, she worked with Riggan on his play he's doing as his as. Zach Galifianakis plays Riggan's agent. Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, and Andrea Riseborough are all playing the actors, who are in Riggan's play he's doing. Just an absolute A- level cast there.\n\nWhat's the deal: Let me just start off to say about Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu, and his films he had done. In 2001, he directed Amorres Perros, a very bleak and a very strong film, which had great performances, and considered it to be a classic for a lot of people out there. Then, in 2003, he did 21 grams, (his first English film), that somehow may not be as great as Amorres Perros, but it was good for a lot of critics. In 2006, he made Babel, a movie that went down a little, but it did earn a lot of Academy Awards Nominations including best picture. In 2010, he goes back on making another foreign film, Biutiful, starring Javier Bardem, and that does marked the least film that he has done due to its graphic images. Now, he makes Birdman, a dark comedy, which really does take a very thrilling leap forward by Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu. After watching many times of the trailer, I really thought the film was going to be a lot like Silver Linings Playbook. The fact, that these two movies have different genres, but it does have that same subject that the main character is trying to fix his problems, and also trying to get his life back as he wanted to be. Now, when I watched the film, it felt different of what I experienced. That it's not like Silver Linings Playbook at all. It was an absolute darkly comedy, that I was quite amused by it, and the filmmaking was pretty ballsy.\n \nThe nominations: The film is nominated of nine academy award nominations, including best director, best actor, and best picture. Everybody has been talking a lot about Michael Keaton's performance, and I think he does a great job as playing a washed-up actor, who's going into this reality and fantasy world of his. I do think he's going to win the Oscar for best actor in a leading role, but I'm not 100% sure of it, because people do talked about another actor in another movie, Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, which I had not yet saw the movie. Of course, Michael Keaton's recent films: Robocop (remake), and Need for Speed has been disappointed. In fact, I haven't seen the remake of Robocop. I really detested Need for Speed, though. But, anyway, I do think his performance carried a lot of great strength in the film. As for the rest of the cast, I do think they did a solid job in the film, especially Edward Norton, and Emma Stone, who are nominated this year.  Emmanuel Luebezki's cinematography (better known for winning an Oscar for Gravity) is very beautiful to look at. The direction by Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu is pretty ballsy, and the reason why I'm saying that because almost the entire movie is done with this one long shot, and the camera angles were moving around in places, when we see these characters of where they're going, and what they're doing. It reminded me of something that Sam Raimi had done that with The Evil Dead trilogy, except he was only doing it to make it scary. Now, my only question I have with this movie is why Birdman won best screenplay at the Golden Globes?  I mean, I do see the fact that the screenplay is very well written, and it does have some creativity, but I really do think The Grand Budapest Hotel deserved to win best screenplay because it had so much creativity, and it is just so wonderfully written, that it was so hard for me to resist. The screenplay to this film is still well-written, though.\n\nMy full opinion: I wouldn't say that Birdman is a perfect film for me, because some of the visuals in the film really does warned me down, but for the most part, I was actually quite amused by this absolute ballsy dark comedy, that Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu had just created. 8.6/10",

After watching several interesting and well written scenes involving Mike (Norton), the character is then quite abruptly and inexplicably dropped.

So this movie opens on him preparing a show on Broadway that he is writing, directing, and starring in. Of course if you've heard anything about this film it's not the plot, but the fact that it is intended to appear as one entirely continuous take. It's a fun artistic choice, however I did struggle with it at times because without breaks I sometimes had difficulty figuring out how much time had passed in the moment it took them to sweep the camera from one end of the room to another. However, the rapid-fire way they moved from one scene to the next without cuts made the whole thing feel very theatrical. In fact, the stuff that was happening to the characters backstage sometimes felt as scripted as the stuff we see them doing on stage. I don't mean this as an insult because a number of the speeches and monologues that characters have in this film are simply wonderful. It all flows very nicely and even caused me to question what was actually a line in the play and when someone was bringing their personal life on stage.\n\nThe true brilliance of Birdman is in the cast. I could walk through every single actor on the list and talk about how awesome they were, but it would get repetitive after awhile. I could not ask for more from their performances, and it seemed almost every person had their one scene to shine which they nailed. Instead of gushing endlessly about the cast I think I'll get to the couple of things that I didn't love in Birdman. First of all, this movie continuously inserted some magical elements into the story. I thought it did a nice job of straddling the line and making the viewer question whether these things were happening in reality or only in the main character's unstable mind. However, towards the end it feels like we are given a definitive answer, and then a little while later we are given a contradictory definitive answer. I just would like the movie to either leave it ambiguous or make up its mind. The only other problem I had with Birdman was the way it seemed to take a number of stands on things but it was never solidly decided on one stance. For instance, is it villainizing superhero films or glorifying them? It was beautifully presented, perfectly acted, and had a lot of excellent scenes but it didn't really have anything to say. There were several moments where I was asking myself \"Why is this scene even in the movie? Is there an overall point to all this?\" I guess I didn't totally understand the film, but I'd gladly watch it again to attempt to figure it out.",

The story, which follows a former Hollywood star (Keaton) who tries to write, direct, and act in a broadway play to prove himself an artist, seems like it might be deriving aspects of Keaton's real career. The plot is very well structured, but it loses a bit of its balance in the final act.

Birdman truly deserves to win Best picture in my opinion and I absolutely loved this film. This may even be a comeback role for Michael Keaton and I hope he gets the Oscar as well.

I looked at his filmography and he's been busy cashing paychecks, but in nothing I have seen since 2002's Live From Baghdad, an HBO movie, which itself was billed as a sort of comeback.   What Keaton does in this movie is what all the great movie stars have done before him, he is both himself and the character at the same time.  The material is that of a Neill Simon satire of Hollywood and Broadway minus the comedy.  Those of us that remember how good Michael Keaton he was in the 1980s have probably wondered why he stopped getting the A-list roles.  Maybe it was Batman, but he was also occupying the same real estate as Tom Hanks and Robin Williams.  He had the problem that Joel McRae faced with Gary Cooper or Randolph Scott had with Jimmy Stewart, winning actors that find themselves with the rejected scripts of bigger stars.  \nThis movie trades the comedy normal in satire for a bit of art house pretension that works better in European movies but fits right in with this material.  Keaton's alter ego is BIRDMAN, the character that had made him rich and famous 20 years prior.  Birdman is constantly getting into his head and the audience gets to see Keaton's super powers when he gets angry.  I don't think I have read Raymond Carver since around the time Keaton was making Batman movies, but the play is based on his work.   It's a great choice for an actor of fluff that is looking for something he takes to be depth and the script also gives Keaton a personal connection back to Carver.  Overall the movie is realism splashed with dreamlike moments, but on reflection the movie only makes sense as a dream or a delusion.  I appreciated the nuance and the ambiguity.\nIt has some notable co-stars, including a deglamorized Emma Stone, a youthful looking Naomi Watts, Edward Norton channeling that pipsqueak Brando thing he does, along with Amy Ryan as the ex-wife and Zach Galifianakis as the best friend and producer.  \nThis is one of the better films of 2014 and I look forward to the director's commentary when it comes out on DVD.   We can only hope that this time Keaton is back for good giving us some meaty performances over the next ten years.   If I had to place a wager I think this would be most likely to win Best Picture by process of elimination.",

It seemed to me only partially true. \n\nReegan may not be a very likable character, but the complicated feelings he inspires is what makes one return to the film later. His manic delusions are grotesque and pitiful, and the lack of love his self-absorption leaves his daughter and lover are hateful. At the same time, his courage in putting his career on the line inspires admiration, as do his soliloquies of great pathos. \n\nIf you are looking for a movie both enjoyable and light, and difficult and thought-provoking, Birdman is a safe bet.",

What I like about the film is that the characters are vulnerable, hurt, bewildered, confused, but they carry their confusion with a certain dignity.  After all, life is just a stage; the cinematography looks like a guy with a camera following the actors around and never quite knowing what the actors will do next. \nThe female parts show surprising kindness and vulnerability--which empowers them.  The all- too -powerful theatre critic is brassy and tangles  with Keaton; he needs a good review: they both stick up for their rights: she to be a critic and he an artist.  After all, it's not the result that is all important, but its all important that he try.  Keaton shows about every emotion in the acting book and his nomination for a best actor Oscar is timely.",

You essentially watch him fall to pieces over the course of a few weeks. (Going back to the long takes, using those made weeks feel like one long day, which was a brilliant move). Edward Norton is also really interesting as a super method actor (and one wonders how much of that was acting...) and Emma Stone also does a good job as Keaton's daughter.

The story revolves around Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) a down on his luck actor who is better known for his portrayal of the super hero Birdman. He attempts to make people remember the man behind the mask by producing, directing, and staring in a broadway play, but he keeps hitting walls at every turn, sometimes real and sometimes in his own mind.\n\nThis film was beloved during it's limited release I personally left the theater enjoying what i saw but also confused at what it was. Birdman is a good movie, but it is by no means perfect and some elements are just plain bad. It's biggest strength is in it's cinematography with long uncut tracking shots following characters in and out of rooms, conveying that you're watching a play more then a movie. It also plays around with diegetic and non-diegetic sounds to convey a sense of frustration and instability. However while the film falls flat when it comes to the plot, it starts out strong and pulls the audience in quickly, but during the second act the film seems like it forgot what it's trying to say and goes all over place. Certain scenes that would be large plot points are just forgotten by the third act and gives us an ending that just seems forced and cliched. \n\nThe best performance of the entire film goes to Michael Keaton, while he was not actually in Alejandro's mind when we wrote Birdman he was still the perfect choice. He does wall at conveying an actor who isn't a good person but makes you root for him. We may not see Keaton as much as we used to but after this film it's should be obvious people will want to see him more. Edward Norton nearly stole the show as a antisocial overly realistic method actor. He can sometimes become over the top in his performance, but brings it down at the right moments for him to be taken seriously. Emma Stone plays Keaton's post-rehab daughter, who's always been a great actress but in this role she's a mixed bag. When she tries to convey an angsty depressed Lindsey Lohan type girl, it comes across as simply forced, but she really shines in the more sincere moments especially with Keaton, doing well to convey a loving relationship. The most disappointing performance in the whole movie has to be Zach Galifanakis, while he looks good he just doesn't stand out among the herd of other great actors. Anytime he wasn't on screen I would totally forget he was even in the movie.\n\nAll in all the film started strong but ran out of breath near the end. I am not dissapointed i saw it at all, but i'm happy to have only seen it once. While I highly doubt it will win best picture hopefully this will mean Keaton being brought in for leading rolls.",

He was Batman! I love Batman! And he's in a new film! Brilliant!\"\n\nThrough Keaton-coloured glasses, Birdman is viewed as a sort of homecoming party, and I can't help but fast forward a few years to wonder how time will treat it. We start out with an engaging little ensemble drama set on Broadway, and we finish with a maddeningly self-indulgent, freewheeling \"exploration\" which upends most of our established feelings about Keaton's Riggan Thomson, renders nearly everything we've seen happen prior to be either meaningless or nonsensical, and leaves us on a note which is \"open to interpretation\" in as much as you're choosing between thinking \"what the fuck was that?\" or yawning.\n\nIt's problematic.\n\nBut, it is undoubtedly a technical marvel - if you've any interest in cinematography, this is a no-brainer. It is extremely meticulously put together, and it looks fantastic. And everyone in it is good. And it really is a good film for the first hour or so - infuriatingly so, as it turns out. As it ran out of steam somewhere into the second hour, the film that leapt to mind by way of comparison was Darren Aronofsky's howlingly pretentious Black Swan. Both films have an annoyingly loose grasp on what I was demanding from them: structure and meaning. Indeed, in a moment here which is supposed to be self-referential and clever, Keaton literally walks past a character using Macbeth to describe the film he's in: \"It is a tale. Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.\" - I couldn't help but think to myself, \"yup!\"",

So the whole film revolves around that show, it feels more like a play than a film. It is a satirical commentary on the bombardment of superhero films in our age. Keaton's performance was outstanding, along with brilliant performances by Emma Stone? and Edward Norton? as supporting cast. The cinematography was fabulous given there are very few visible cuts.

You combine it with the uneasy camera angles and the annoying music (which was probably produced by JK Simmons' conservatory after throwing some cymbals at his drummer's head), and it created a strange dizzying sensation that matched the plight of the Birdman. I loved the ending and think this movie is the dark horse to win it all since the historical/true story movies will split votes and people will wake up and realize that beyond the gimmick of filming it over 12 years, Boyhood wasn't a very good movie. When all is said and done, though, Birdman's most lasting contribution will be that it inspired two artists to create a new style called \"extreme realism.\"",

Technically consummate (the intricately designed photography is mindblowing), superlative acting, layered script and all tied together by Inarritu's  virtuoso direction, this will be the film to beat at the Oscars (I prefer Boyhood, but at Oscars there is a strong preference for films which are referential to filmmaking itself). But awards considerations aside, this is both enjoyable and thought provoking and one of best films I have seen about self validation.",

            "content": "Strong performances,mind-bending layered screenplay and technically brilliant\n\n Honestly I really don't understand why I ended up liking Birdman so much. The story feels as much ignorant as the alternate title.To begin with I truly was not able to stick myself with plausibility of the events shown in the film. Although I was quite able to relate to it metaphorically but the ending left me pretty much hanging. The story has a multi-layered point of view and the writers have done splendid job working on small little details which many casual viewers miss. Birdman is a kind of movie where you will spot something new on multiple viewings that you might have missed earlier.\n\n The story revolves around Riggan (played masterfully by Micahel Keaton) who was once a famous superstar for playing superhero Birdman in blockbuster movies. Now past his middle age, Riggan seems to have lost his path in the film industry but his mind is not a phase to accept it. He is working on Broadway play which he himself is directing and writing apart from acting in it to showcase his talents. We get see his internal struggle countering with his alter-ego \"Birdman\" who makes him feel he is still a superstar and shouldn't waste his time on Broadway plays. Also he is facing family problems with distances between him and his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) constantly increasing. Starring in his play is a hardcore actor Mike (Edward Norton) whose dedications have no limit while he is acting and two more actress Leasley(Naomi Watts) and Laura(Andrea Riseborough) who have relatively smaller role. The entire star-studded cast was absolutely brilliant to watch and each of their characters is given ample amount of depth.\n\n The cinematography is excellent and the entire film is edited to make it look like a one continuous shot (except once in the climax). The background score comprising mostly drums was also splendid. The multi-layered screenplay was very interesting and there were also many laugh-out-loud moments which was a really surprising considering the theme was more of dark comedy. I am not very clear about what rating to give right now, will have stronger opinion after re-watching it few times. Still with its stellar cast, weirdly intelligent script I must admit Birdman is one the finest films I have seen this year. \n\nRATING:[4.5/5]",

            "content": "\"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige\"\n\nMexican director Alejandro Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu is not normally known for his jeu d'esprit and has seemed more comfortable while dealing with heavily pessimistic and sombre themes. His previous films Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful are all excellent works but they require serious commitment to get yourself through their excruciatingly downbeat material. With that in mind, it's no surprise that his latest effort in Birdman is ultimately about the fractured and fragile psyche of a man on a seemingly downward spiral. However, Birdman shows another side to I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu's talents; black it may be but he now surprisingly  displays a great talent for comedy.\n\nRiggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) was once a massive Hollywood star that made his reputation playing the superhero Birdman. However, his career faded after the third instalment of the franchise and he now finds himself working on the Broadway stage. He's determined to prove his worth as a real actor and director by adapting a Raymond Carver play but problems with his cast, his family and his own fragile mental state threaten to sink his ambitions.\n\nFilms within films have often been a theme throughout filmmaking. To become self-referential is a bold move. Robert Altman's The Player, Spike Jonze's Adaptation or the surreal work of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive are notable works that have toyed with the life imitating art imitating life structure. It can be hard to pull off but these films are just some  examples of when it's done right and I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu's latest can now consider itself to be on the same level.\n\nOn previous evidence, I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu has proven to be a very clever director. He has always had a grasp on his material and delivered their fractured structures and timeframes with deftness and consummate skill. His work on Birdman is as impressive as he's ever been but it's the handling of comedy that's impresses most. Not only is he able to capture the absurdity and quirks in human behaviour but he also utilises these behaviours to create an inventive and original farce.\nEmploying the likes of Emmanuel Lubezki as director of photography is also a genius stroke. In a short space of time, Lubezki has become one of the most respected cinematographer's in the business and if you look at his work on Gravity last year or his work here, you can easily see why. He manages to keep the camera constantly moving throughout the films entirety; one minute we're focused, up close and personal, on the actors before sweeping through claustrophobic corridors, upstairs and down to find another dramatic moment. The film wasn't shot as one continuous take but it's miraculously made to look like it and credit must go to editors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione for their seamless work on Lubezki's constantly mobile camerawork.\n\nAs the long, seemingly  continuous shots grab your attention, though, so too do the performances. Across the board, everyone delivers. Amy Ryan and Andrea Riseborough are given small roles but they're by no means ineffective. Naomi Watts produces the emotional quality she always does and Emma Stone really sinks her teeth into the conflicted and tortured daughter role. Again, Zach Galifiniakas is given a small role where he only sporadically appears throughout the story but whenever he does, he commands a surprising range of emotions. I was very impressed with his dramatic work when he's normally considered a comedy actor. From the supporting players, though, it's Ed Norton who shines brightest. It's been a while since Norton has had a role that he's able to reaffirm his talents but he finds it here. Again, self-referential, Norton sends himself up. He has a reputation for being difficult to work with but bravely embraces a character that similarly reflects his acting methods. As a big admirer of Norton, I can only hope that this sees him back where he belongs. Which brings me to the leading man; I've never really been too kind or retrained on my dislike for Michael Keaton. I've often found him to be quite a self-conscious actor and could never shake off the feeling that most of his work is nothing more than a performance. He never allowed me to suspend my disbelief and for any actor that is a major demerit and (to be brutally honest) unforgivable. That being said, as Riggan Thompson, Keaton wonderfully parodies himself and I have to hold my hands up here... he's absolutely outstanding in Birdman. It's by far his finest work to date and a role that's tailor made for him. Having successfully donned the Batsuit in Tim Burton's take on the dark knight, Keaton never really reached those heights again. He had the occasional role that provided him with reasonable supporting hits but, for the most part, Keaton had had his day. This is the film that will, no doubt, bring him more work where his fans will rejoice in seeing his solid return.\n\nI was honestly one for passing Birdman by. I do enjoy the works of Norton and I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu but when I heard about Michael Keaton headlining a film, I considered giving it a wide berth. However, the buzz surrounding it left me with no choice but to check it out. I'm glad I did as it's an accomplished piece of work that explores the weighty themes of the human ego, past successes and the inability to come to terms with failure. Meanwhile, it satirises showbiz, and in particular, the superhero hero genre. Everyone from Woody Harrelson in The Hunger Games to Robert Downey, Jr in his \"tin-man get up\" takes a dig but ultimately the film is one big in-joke that manages to tread a fine line between fantasy and reality.\n\nMark Walker",

The acting was exquisite across the board, and the tongue-in-cheek premise of Michael Keaton as a washed-up former movie superhero was explored exceptionally well. Riggan Thomson (Keaton's character) noted that the role he was playing on a Broadway stage felt like a microcosm of his character's life, and I can't help but wonder how much Keaton felt Thomson was a microcosm of his actual life.\n\nAt one point in the film, Thomson decries a critics' review as nothing more than a mere \"label.\" Well, here's a label for Birdman: phenomenal.",

            "content": "I'm pained to say that I didn't love Birdman, as the single-shot cinematography was executed fluidly and delightfully. It's ambitious. Even Gravity had a few cuts littered throughout the film on occasion. Birdman, from the introduction of Michael Keaton as washed-up actor Riggan (formerly titular star of superhero film 'Birdman'; great casting) meditating in the air to the intense on-stage climax, has no cuts. This condition certainly limits director Alejandro Gonzalez in reward for unique results. Admirable, too, considering how costume and makeup changes had to be at Broadway level for certain transitions to work. I doubt that Gonzalez would cheat via editing. The music feels like New York and Broadway, switching between familiar classical movements and the showmanship of a sole jazz drummer. We become familiar with the layout of the Broadway theater that the movie takes place in, and the streets around the theater. On the subject of familiarity, since this film centers around Keaton's play production, we also become familiar with certain scenes of the play, and each repetition feels drastically different. As an actor, I empathized with those in the production, in fear of the show fucking up at any moment, or at the worst moment.\n\nStrangely, what happens on stage or in public was far more interesting than the exposition behind the curtain. Besides Michael Keaton, the other stage actors are hardcore method acting and controlling-in-compensation-for-flaccid-penis Edward Norton, the sexually unsatisfied Naomi Watts, and emotionally unsatisfied Andrea Riseborough. Keaton's character has a daughter, played by Emma Stone, who got out of rehab and blames Keaton for the err of her ways. What's unfortunate about the cinematography is that Gonzalez limited himself to focusing on one or two characters for an extended time, inherently leaning towards the Birdman. I can't articulate how the minor characters change, as the movie abandons their side stories well before the climax.\n\nThat leaves us with Birdman/Riggan. His character is a wreck, despite directing and starring in a Broadway show. He is constantly unsatisfied with his show, primarily because Norton is hogging the spotlight from him. Combined with one critic's promise to destroy the show and on-stage embarrassments, Keaton is in constant conflict with his former self, a true superhero. Literally. He has mental, sometimes physical, arguments with himself in a Birdman costume. Keaton's losses and victories over himself, and the world, might be the first time I discovered how talented he really is, beyond his works with Tim Burton. Within Keaton's vision, we see him exploit telekinetic powers and the ability to fly. No one else sees that though. I won't spoil the climax, but what happens afterwards warps what I assumed to be the real world. Rather than people seeing Keaton as mentally ill, they hail him as a truly groundbreaking actor. The film ends with others seeing him as the superhero, as Keaton flies around New York City and possibly fights crime. I understand that the superpowers are metaphorical. That's not what I'm talking about. By the end, I couldn't tell what Birdman wanted to be. A satire on the celebrity culture of Broadway, in comparison to Hollywood? A 'hyperrealistic' depiction of how less successful shows can beat the odds and trump the critics? It can't be both, so whatever the screenwriters and Gonzalez were going for, I'm opting for neither. The lack of focus and undeveloped characters are disappointing. It may not be the decades-to-last art piece that I wanted, but I would still recommend seeing this once for the cinematography alone, with committed performances, some enthralling scenes, and a definite New York feel as bonuses.",

Look past narrative and character depth and acting--which are all on point here anyway--and realize that you will rarely watch anything like this in your lifetime. There's nothing commercial about this. Much could be said about the equally innovative Boyhood. \n\nBut in Birdman's case, the long takes adds to the complexity of the story and the palpability of it. You know there's no BS because you're seeing everything--and it all makes sense. And while the film seems to mostly be one single shot, it still has so many stories intertwined that all relate to one another as though the characters are apart of the same plain--and they can't avoid each other.\n\nIt's a commentary of show business, but it isn't preachy, and it doesn't blatantly take sides. It shows things for what they are.\n\nTo me it's impossible to criticize something that's as honest as this. You watch this film an then you go and watch the next Nicholas Sparks film and compare their integrities. One of those you feel like you're a customer at somebody's business, and the other you feel like you're staring at a masterpiece at an art gallery. A masterpiece of film is greater than the sum of it's parts. Birdman doesn't fall apart at the seams if something is out of line. It isn't dependent on one aspect of the film. Even with mediocre acting this film would be incredible. \n\nTwizard Rating: 99",

Aside from the fragile ego and short temper of its leading man, the play's production is troubled by a jaded method actor (Edward Norton), Riggan's drug-addled daughter (Emma Stone), and the hallucinatory specter of the superhero who resulted in Riggan's eternal typecasting. Director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu uses a lot of handheld cameras and extreme close-ups in Birdman; this results in a claustrophobic film that gives the audience the impression that they're spying on the actors rather than watching them perform. That helps the film achieve a chilling effect, but the principle strength of Birdman lies in the excellent performances by Keaton, Norton, and the rest of the well-chosen cast.",

            "content": "The story which is presented in Birdman isn't really compelling or particularly interesting. What is though is the Oscar worthy acting and the unbelievable cinematography.\nThe Camera - When the camera simply refuses to jump cut, as an audience member you are stuck along for the ride that is this fluid film.  You feel like you're part of the film.  As the actors do their thing each innovative transition gracefully moves you from room to room and scene to scene and you are right there with them. Because of this effect you are infinitely more invested in what's happening because it is as though there is never a moment to naturally blink.\nThe Acting - Actors are good memorizing lines. Though too often dialogue feels like just that, a memorized line.  The filming style of this movie (super long takes with complicated behind the scenes choreography) purposely left in 'mistakes' in the dialogue. But in reality everyone stumbles, repeats, stutters, etc. when speaking in everyday life.  The actors in this movie, and within the play within the movie, really do seem like they are just improvising everything, speaking normally, and it comes across as really real. There's no other way to put it, it's as though you are watching real life. Even the outlandish moments, like Michael Keaton's fantasies, are believable because the world created by the non cutting fluid camera moves refuses to pull you out of the story.\nThe Music - It is sparse consisting almost entirely of jazz drumming. And it fits perfectly. Enough said.\nConclusion - The performances truly are Academy Award deserving (See the Emma Stone and Michael Keaton scene where they discuss using drugs). The cinematography is so engaging you simply cannot get away from the story if you want to. This movie is an example to all other movies on how to almost force an audience to like your movie; by making an overall bland story interesting with phenomenal acting, 'in real life' camera work, and the 'less is more' mantra repeated throughout every aspect of the film.",

Emmanuel Lubezki is one of the best cinematographers in Hollywood and he should continue working and experimenting with his fellow Mexican directors. Birdman is visually astonishing and one of the most unforgettable moviegoing experiences of the year. He blew us away last year when he took us to space in Gravity, and now he astonishes audiences once again by giving us the illusion that the film is taking place entirely in one single shot. From the opening shot, Lubezki is letting us know that we are going to get our heads spun and so he circles around a table with four actors discussing their roles in the play they are about to act in. Birdman is unlike any other film I've seen in that sense, where you feel like you are watching actors in a live theater. The audience becomes the camera which follows around these egocentric and troubled actors as they interact with one another. The film has stuck with me and it is one of those rare movies I'd like to experience once again in the theaters. I can't think of another film that manages to portray the passage of time so well without having to cut from one scene to the next the way Birdman does. \n\nAlejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu is better known for his realistic and depressive films focusing on separate characters whose lives intertwine someway or another (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel). This was quite a fantastic change of tone from his previous and more depressing films. He has crafted one of the best films of the year with groundbreaking editing effects that magically make us believe the film is all a continuous shot. He also uses dark and satirical humor to critique egocentric Hollywood actors, critics, artists, and even audiences who eat up anything they are served as long as there are loud explosions and non-stop action scenes. I\u00f1arritu takes a shot at just about everyone.\nAlexander Dinelaris's script was wickedly smart and satirical with some great and memorable dialogues that complement the technical achievements of the film very well. Birdman has a lot to say about our human nature and our desperation to become relevant and important. It is a complete film that deserves all the recognition and awards it has been receiving.\n\nThe performances in Birdman also stand out above most films released this year. Michael Keaton is fantastic as Riggan Thomson, a once popular actor who starred in a superhero franchise but hasn't been able to do anything relevant since. He is known for the character of Birdman, but he wants to prove he is a real artist and not just a washed up celebrity. That is why he is risking everything in a play he is directing, writing, producing, and starring in. His good friend, Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is co-producing the play with him. Lesley (Naomi Watts), Laura (Andrea Riseborough), and Mike (Edward Norton) are the actors he hires for the play, while his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is working for him as his personal assistant as she tries to recover from her former drug addictions. The supporting cast is excellent in this film, especially Edward Norton and Emma Stone who share several great scenes together along with Michael Keaton. Galifianakis also impresses in a much more serious role than what we are used to seeing him in, but this is still Keaton's film who displays a wide range of emotions. Birdman has become such an important part of his life that he actually interacts with him in a surreal way. The film balances this magical realism very well and Keaton pulls off the feat of having these inner conversations with himself. The intimate camerawork only enhances these performances even more.",

He is not sure what is real and what is not real based on the fact that the truth is buried deep within a chaotic whirlwind of perceptions. And this is exactly how the movie plays. You are never quite sure as to really where things stand for our anti-hero except he is psychologically on a sinking ship. We know this from the very beginning. The screenplay keeps the audience off balance as we try to unravel the puzzle as the camera weaves through a maze of illusion and reality. It is perfect that this plays out in an actual theatre, because illusion exists on stage and also within the psyches that quite can't see beyond oblivion. Michael Keaton plays the actor beautifully and we see a truth in his disintegration. Is he his past career which has disappeared or is there an ability to make sense of  his being. Ably supported by Naomi Watts as a fellow actress, Ed Norton an upstart, New York actor who is full of himself, and Emma Stone as the actor's daughter that can't quite see beyond the veil of her twelve step program. Hollywood is playfully skewered. This is the twenty first century All About Eve, but for a man. Existential cinematography that has long shots makes the dream seamless. To say that this is perfection, would be an overstatement. It pokes fun at the masses, the press, and our trivial way to delude ourselves. Yet it is fascinating nonetheless.",

It was her character who said the most interesting lines. Her rant at her father sums up the idea of the movie pretty well. And the ending is beautiful. The movie is quite original and definitely has talent inside. I just didn't like it more than that. I guess I must be tired of Hollywood (or Broadway) gazing at its navel.",

While I appreciate the effort taken to build up each scene, not enough of the film was spent dissecting and evolving Riggan Thompson's alter ego. While Emma Stone might've thought her role was meant to be portrayed as minimalist she could've added a lot more meat to her character. The director blew a very clear cut opportunity to take the human form aka Riggan Thompson and transform him into the psyche that was playing on his mind aka Birdman.

And unfortunately for me I suck when it comes to going to films with no expectations. I just had to read all the reviews, watch the trailer twenty times and so on. And nine times out of ten it damages my enjoyment of the film.\n\nActor Riggan Thomson is most famous for his movie role from over twenty years ago of the comic book superhero Birdman in the blockbuster movie of the same name and its two equally popular sequels. His association with the role took over his life, where Birdman is more renowned than \"Riggan Thomson\" the actor. Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of a Raymond Carver story.\n\nBirdman is just about as good as everyone is saying, which is praise worthy in itself. First thing to talk about is the direction by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, no sorry, rather Emmanuel Lubeski, who is without doubt the best DP working today and here he delivers his finest achievement. This is any cinematographers wet dream.\n\nIt was originally Alejandro's plan to shoot the film in one seamless take. And if you know anything about filmmaking you will understand that is near on impossible. I say 'near impossible' because remarkably it has been pulled of before. Back in 2002 director Aleksandr Sokurov pulled this off managing to shoot his 99 minute film, Russian Ark, in one take without any cuts at all. Birdman, in my opinion does something just as impressive.\n\nWhat director I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, DP Lubezki and editors Stephen Mirrione and Douglas Crise have done here is to shoot a series of long takes and masterfully blend them together creating, what appears, is one seamless take. If you're a film fanatic like myself you will probably pick upon where they might have cut but it's very hard to notice unless you're really paying attention to the logistics of the thing.\n\nIn a way this could be seen as a flaw in that the film's technical achievements could be used as a tool to distract you from the fact that film's storyline isn't as polished as its surface. But Birdman does a fine job in telling its story so I don't think it's too much of problem, other than maybe a few characters feeling underwritten. The acting in the film is first rate, everyone does superbly in their respective roles especially the man everyone's shouting about, Michael Keaton. What a comeback! My god.\n\nThe score is great which is entirely percussion based, really original and goes brilliantly with the film. I can't say it's the best film of the year but it's certainly up there. Birdman is a real achievement.",

Much of the film is made of long, continuous camera shots that follow Keaton around as he tries to make this show his comeback from painful obscurity as a has-been celebrity. He also tries to make amends with his neglected family. The camera keeps rolling while following him around like a documentary but with minimal shaking, as he runs from from person to person and challenge to challenge. The ending leaves some room for interpretation, but whatever you conclude, this is definitely a journey through the psychological affects of being famous (at one time). It has some bizarre moments where we sometimes cross over into the mind apart from reality without any flag to mark reality and fantasy. It's not the standard fun flick, it has some dry humor to give it a lighthearted feel. is notably creative, well-acted, and gives deep characters that altogether present a commentary on the highs and lows of being a celebrity.",

Its like he's in some way playing himself in the movie after his Batman days; its a case of the makers getting the casting spot on...There are many moments in the movie where you think that probably this is the scene which gave him his nomination, nd no doubt he's leading the race this time...Moments b/w him nd Stone (who btw comes in with another top notch performance to land herself a first academy award nomination) provide some great minutes of cinema..AGI's (who's Mexican and not a Spaniard unlike last year's award winning visionary director alfonso cuaron) vision and character exploration is just impeccable and has taken the movie to another level...",

            "content": "In \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" former Batman star Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a has-been actor who used to play a superhero named Birdman in three successful Hollywood blockbusters. Now he aims to gain respect and recognition on Broadway, directing and starring in an adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".\n\nThe film follows Riggan through a painstaking process of rehearsals and drama both behind and in front of the curtain. He stars with his girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and Broadway newcomer Lesley (Naomi Watts). One of his actors gets injured and has to be replaced on the spot by Mike (Edward Norris), a volatile but ingenious character actor of bigger fame than Riggan himself. Mike is also sleeping with Lesley, how else. Creative differences and conflict abound when two special egos collide. The play's producer, Riggan's lawyer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) is desperately trying to hold the production together. Among all the action is Riggan's teenaged daughter and current assistant Sam (Emma Stone), freshly out of rehab.\n\nRiggan hears the voice of Birdman in his head. He uses supernatural powers of telekinesis on objects- only when he is by himself. The pressure to create something meaningful begins to overtake him. A deconstruction of his fragile psyche seems imminent. But he has so much to say. He needs to create, but does he have it in him?\n\nThis is the fifth feature from art house favorite Alejandro Gonz\u00e1les I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. I have found all of his movies fascinating, but often a bit tedious. \"Babel\" was especially dragging, if accomplished. I was from the start pleasantly surprised by the intensity of \"Birdman\". It's a mixture of drama, comedy and magical realism, all of which work together perfectly. But the experience that is this movie runs deeper and captivates absolutely.\n\nTheater is always an interesting setting but here it's being utilized in its fullest capacity. The film is shot as if with one take like an evolved version Hitchcock's masterful \"The Rope\", the camera floats completely free as a bird, following the characters through the maze-like structure of the theater, relieving the viewer from an otherwise claustrophobic experience of the location. The picture never cuts, nor does the storytelling. \"Birdman\" film is a lot about dialog, and who says what and especially where in the setting is crucial; the theatre is like a Freudian interpretation of the movie's- or maybe Riggan's- psyche which we get to explore.\n\nAnd then there's the atmosphere. We are definitely working somewhere within the subconscious. The subtly surreal reality of the movie borrows from the greatest works of Woody Allen, David Cronenberg and Martin Scorsese, but stands on its own. The script reflects Raymond Carver in just the right way, considering. The actors are all superb, the Broadway a character in itself. The soundtrack is a showcase of minimalism, an occasional jazzy drum solo elevates key scenes, telling us that we are experiencing a deeper level of the dreamscape whose symbols we are invited to decipher.\n\n\"Birdman\" is magic. It's unique, seductive and special, a masterpiece that confirms I\u00f1\u00e1rritu as not only a talented but genius filmmaker.",

Secondly, the characterization, it's not just the personality of each character, but also the in-depth look of each other's life. You noticed, how good they are in this film. Michael Keaton (Riggan) as the protagonist, he is seriously impressive here. He's having this wild imagination with an imaginary friend like he is bothered nor struggled at times, and he wants to prove, he's not just a celebrity, but a stage actor. He wants to prove how he's good at it. Edward Norton as Mike, he is more of an asshole, like he does that for the better. I really dig Emma Stone's performance in here, and she feels for it. And special mention to Zack. I mean, I never though he can do one of these roles. He is a smart-assy type of lawyer and he's good at it. This is a well scripted, and with brilliant performances. It tells how us, not just the actors, but the everyday people. How do we handle the pressure like these. The sense of urgency. By not being mentally incompetent about anything.

Not because it's too deep, or surreal, or because of all the long tracking shots with drummers inexplicably in the middle of the scene, but because there's no actual substance here. There's a lot of muddling about, a lot of self-reflection and even a little grandstanding, but in the end the characters have not become any more fleshed-out, the story hasn't moved in any particular direction, and the audience is being dared to not like the movie. By inserting the evil critic character and the scene immediately following her comparison of  \"celebrity versus Actor\", the movie essentially says, \"if you don't like this piece of high art, then you're just a heathen who likes Michael Bay movies.\" \n\nWell, I'm neither. Michael Bay is horrible, but \"Birdman\" is bland.\n\nWhile I can say that every actor gives a fantastic performance, I can also say they're not actually DOING anything in those performances. Their characters are made of particle board. The plot is thin-to-nonexistent. The \"message\" is nothing special. The moral never comes into focus. \n\nI'm telling you: It's okay not to like \"Birdman\". Really. It's okay not to \"get it\". You're still cool, and you're not making yourself look foolish or unhip. There's nothing to \"get\" here. It's just a big ball of directorial ego wrapped in brown paper. \n\nMark Twain said a \"classic\" is \"A book which people praise and don't read.\" Well, I predict \"Birdman\" will become a classic in that vein. It will be a movie that people praise, but don't actually, deep-down, enjoy. However, because the movie flat-out tells people that not liking it means you're a schlock-loving peasant, people will maintain the dissimulation.",

It tells the story of Michael Keaton who plays a washed up actor trying to make it big with his broadway play.  His daughter treats him like an asshole, his costar kind of IS an asshole, and his attempt to reinvent himself seems to be failing.  \n\nThe film tells the story linearly, but in a way where time jumps forward without any specific indication.  The camera work is fluid, relying on a constant long-take approach facilitated by steadicam and giving the film a dream-like quality.  The acting is quite brilliant, with Galifinakis, Stone, and Norton really standing out in my opinion.   The soundtrack is also fantastic, featuring some really groovy jazz tracks and some brilliant classical tracks including Ravel's Pavane (a personal favorite).  So why do I dislike the film?  Well...  \n\nThe subject matter is, in my opinion, fairly shallow.  There's a lot of emphasis on some deeper spiritual/philosophical meaning that feels patched together rather than properly explored.  The long-take steadicam work is well done, but I found it unnecessary and distracting, waiting for cuts instead of paying attention to the film.  Everyone in the film is barely relateable, coming across as shallow and self-absorbed.  The film strives to be surrealistic, a style I love a lot, but something about the combination of elements made this film feel like it was using surrealism as a crutch to obfuscate the otherwise thin story.  \n\nTL;DR - 5/10\nI'm probably going to be crucified for my review, but that's fine.  This film is simultaneously great and horrible, but that doesn't mean you won't end up really enjoying it.  I highly recommend checking it out at least once to get your own opinion, because although I'm not the film's biggest fan, I do consider it a worthwhile film, especially in today's relatively shit cinematic landscape.",

            "content": "While innovative director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has given us many brilliant films before, this is the first time he's delved into the genre of comedy, that too black comedy. His ambitious attempt to make the movie appear to be shot in one seamless motion for most of it (with the help of numerous retakes and proper edits) certainly works to the movie's advantage; it makes us a part of the lead protagonist's (Thomas Riggan's) inescapable reality, much like life. But more importantly, it takes us into the mind of the director himself.\n\nIn a bird's eye view, the film may appear to be a critique on the ever-growing trend of superhero movies, and the politics of show business in general. But essentially, it's a satire on human traits like ego and ambition, our constant search and struggle to feel relevant and important in this world; many of us forsake everything else in order to achieve this. We can see this through Riggan's character, who is conflicted between the once-achieved stardom through his Birdman movies and his present, where he is adapting the work of an author (Carver) because of whom he became an actor in the first place. Birdman vs Carver - On one side, we have Birdman, which gained him the love and affection of audiences worldwide, and on the other side, we have Raymond Carver, which represents the kind of intellectual work which usually gets critical acclaim. So, he is stuck between the two, internally struggling to decide which one to choose; he ambitiously wants the love of both audiences and critics alike.\n\nOther than being a black comedy, the movie also falls into the genre of Magical Realism (movies like 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'Life of Pi', 'Midnight in Paris'). Riggan keeps hearing this voice speaking to him, and can perform telekinesis and levitation whenever he wants. This Birdman is just the personification of his inner ego and the larger-than-life image he once had; Riggan wants to soar through the sky. And ego's personification here (Birdman) draws parallels to Icarus (who flew too close to the sun with wings made of feathers and wax).\n\nOther than the amazing screenplay, the dialogues are the film's biggest strength; they are sharp-witted and hilarious, and form the backbone of the film. After that, it's brilliant performances given by Michael Keaton and Edward Norton; they are pure delight to watch. Zach Galifianakis also does a good job, and the four ladies (Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan) look and perform terrific. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work and Antonio Sanchez's drum score certainly help the movie feel like it does. Without Lubezki's assistance, the apparent single shot feat couldn't have been achieved; the movie looks spectacular.\n\nIt's interesting to notice how many of the actors have association with superhero movies; Keaton was Tim Burton's Batman (this is what makes his character self-referential), Norton was the Incredible Hulk, and Stone was Gwen Stacy in the contemporary Spiderman series. On top of that, we see that Riggan's character has many similarities with the character Ed he's playing in the stage play within the movie. And the few aspects of Ed's life which aren't there in Riggan's life become fulfilled towards the second half of the movie. All these parallels help in blurring the lines between fiction and reality, which makes the movies quite psychotic, and at the same time, fascinating.\n\nOverall, the movie tackles with so many captivating themes that a simple review like mine is not enough to discuss all of them. All I can say is, for people who get what the director is going for, the movie is sure to stay etched in their minds for a long time, and forms an important topic for many round-table discussions. 'Birdman' is a mesmerizing experience not to be missed by ardent movie lovers.\n\n-------------------------SPOILERS-------------------------\n\nPeople who might be left confused by ending - We see Riggan get up from his bed and getting onto the window. Then, we see his daughter Sam coming into the room, looking outside the window. She looks up and smiles. The movie ends there.\n\nMy interpretation is: No, Riggan didn't jump off the window and try to kill himself again. We don't see him jumping, we just see him standing there. Maybe he was just enjoying the view of the city (world) with his new-found perspective. He's done with the inner struggle, his mind is at peace now, and his act got him the feeling of relevance he craved for, so there's no need to kill himself. When Sam looks out the window, she looks up and smiles; this is when Riggan's metaphoric fantasy meets Sam's physical reality. Sam sees him flying and soaring through the sky. All this time, Riggan was the only one who was in these delusions of fantasy. He had the larger-that-life image 20 years ago, when he was popular with his Birdman movies. Sam was too young at that time. Now with the new-found fame and acclaim all around, Sam finally sees him the way he has always seen himself - as the majestic hero soaring above everyone.",

            "content": "\"Birdman\" directed by Alenjandro Gonzalez is a mixture of masterful film making with tremendous performance from Michael Keaton , Edward Norton and Emma Stone. The picture got some other stellar performances but we will come to that later.To begin with MIchael Keaton has given one of his career best performances with a single word - \"Range\" . That was one hell of a mixture of comedy to extreme drama without a sense of getting over the top. You could literally hide that character in mask and get the same viscous performance one would imagine. The supporting performance of Edward Norton was brilliant and for a moment during the first act of the film I thought Norton was giving a stellar performance but the most under appreciated performance will probably be Emma Stone but she was right at the heart of the picture. There were many things to make this film work and it required Emma Stone's character to tie them at many places and she nailed. Now when you get stellar performances from your great cast and mix that with one sensational edit which makes this film play out as a play. That is a very subtle metaphor to execute and for that the director and the writer Alenjandro needs to be praised. Not only did he bring out tremendous performances from the main cast but he tied them together along with the editor and presented the whole picture as a play with three acts. Much of what I appreciate about the directing skills is because of that. The screenplay on it's own however lacked a bit of \"special\" to make it all great and it by itself did not have the quality of exuding emotions if one were to read it. It's a brilliant one but it does contain some unnecessary scenes specially when one considers it as a character based drama. So if that would have been tightened the review would have all stars. The music needs to be appreciated and not just the composing of it but the application of it which is why the director along with the composer must be praised . The music does tell a story and not just an underlying factor. But the real star of the picture and it's quite obvious from the look of it is Lubezski. Again the director requires recognition for shot composition but the way the cinematography morphed the story was brilliant. You can consider this 2 hour picture as one long shot and that applicability was brilliant. The lights and the focus of it all was done through the cinematography. It is one of the rare occasion that the cinematography brings out a brilliant performance of the actors. It reflected the whole story. This mexican pcokethouse is actually one of the greatest if not the greatest cinematographer of this era. Everything about that art was brilliant and we don't know whose choice it was but it was seamless.",

Michael Keaton is great in the lead role as a very human middle-age actor in need of renewal. The music is unique too.. it's not Gustavo Santaolalla this time, but it's just lots of minimalist sounds - brushsticks on snare drums and hi hats; evoking the flow and taking the viewer from one room to another.

Being mentioned for and receiving awards, curiosity got the best of me. Should have went with my gut. \n     Forget the acting. Yes, you can have great acting in a bad movie. Will Smith in Six Degrees of Separation comes to mind. Nobody stands out that much in Birdman to make it worth seeing. There is a moment of an entertaining movie here and there buried beneath all the gibberish, but not enough to keep me entertained for 2 hours. That's right: TWO HOURS! \n     If you take actors seriously, and think their lives that go from multi-millionaire to person trying to get it all back after squandering it is interesting, by all means, this movie is for you. \n     Birdman doesn't make you feel sorry for the lead. It doesn't make him a likable person. He's not even a very insightful guy. He's merely a man who's been so wrapped up in himself for such a long time, that now that everything is collapsing, is having something of a breakdown. It's a selfish douche, his screwed up daughter (surprise), a jerk of a critic (unique), a broadway douchey actor (there's plenty of them), and a cast of low self esteem people ranting about nothing, and I mean nothing, important, for TWO HOURS. Then cap it off with a stupid ending. Aaaand curtain. It's not worth seeing at any point, in my opinion.",

            "content": "I'm Birdman! Wait, Crayola Steve is Birdman. Oh wait that's Michael Keaton, wait Michael Keaton was Batman, what the heck is going on here! My review of Birdman right now.\n\nBirdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is directed and written by Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and stars Michael Keaton, Zach Galifiankis, Edward Norton and Emma Stone and tells the story of Riggan Thomas, who in the 1980s played the popular superhero Birdman. Now he is a washed up actor trying to gain success once more by directing, writing and staring in his broadway play. But things are complicated Riggan begins to hear the voice of Birdman.\n\nBirdman is a holy original and masterful piece of work from Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. This features the best ensemble cast of 2014, some of the best editing I've ever seen and is one of the best movies of 2014. If you get the chance to see it, don't miss out.\n\nThere's been a lot of Oscar buzz surrounding Michael Keaton's performance and oh my god does he deserve it! Michael Keaton is at his absolute best in this movie and is perfectly casted. He pretty much plays himself since in the 80s he played Batman and in this movie he played Birdman. It's almost a spoof and it works so great. Keaton here plays a very wounded, sad character who might or might not be losing his mind. In the quiet moment is where Keaton is able to shine and show off his acting chops, something I haven't seen in a very long time. This is one of the best performances of 2014 and he's the frontrunner to win the Oscar for sure!\n\nIn supporting roles are Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Zach Galifiankis. Norton plays Mike Shiner, a method actor who comes on the set of the play and begins to cause some major problems in the production. He is so freaking great in this movie. He basically plays a parody of himself, Norton in real life was been known to have a temper and hard to work with (he got fired from The Incredible Hulk). His interaction with Michael Keaton is some of the best chemistry I've seen in a while since they don't ever see eye to eye. He definitely deserves his Oscar nomination without a doubt. \n\nThen Emma Stone gives the best performance of her career as Riggan's daughter, Sam. She is this rebel character who isn't the best working with people. Her chemistry with Keaton is out of control, they work so well together but it's the scenes she shares with Edward Norton where she truly shines. Stone is one of the best actresses working right now, she and proves it in this movie. And holy crap Zach Galifiankis is freaking great in a small role of Riggan's agent.\n\nBut all credit has to be given to the director of the film. His direction here is so strong. He creates the illusion that this movie is just one log continuous shot. A lot of the movie was shot in ridiculous long takes and with amazing editing, it looks like it's all shot in one whole take. It adds to the feeling of the film. Characters are constantly moving around the stage, front and back and you get this sense of what it's like in these small halls. The camera moving right in front of them or moving in the back of them at all times it was absolutely immersive. Though you can tell where some of the parts were cut for the next scene, it's still amazing to see these characters moving around.\n\nAnd the screenplay, oh my god, the screenplay is brilliant. It's completely original in every sort of way, I've never seen a movie like this before. This movie actually a lot to say about hollywood. It tells and shows you everything that's wrong with hollywood today. It mentions big stars like Robert Downey Jr., and Woody Harrelson so we know they are living in the year 2014. It mocks people who just go to see big blockbusters for the action and visual effects and my personal favorite, what's wrong with critics. There's a reason I don't like being called a critic and the movie tells you why. Some critics don't even watch the movie, they just want to find big or professional words to slap on a DVD cover. They don't even look at the structure, performances, or meaning of anything it's just an easy way to get money. This was my favorite aspect of the movie.\n\nThe music is also great, I loved the score in this movie. It's a very jazzy score with drums playing for the most part. At times you actually see the man playing the drums in various scenes and that was awesome as well.\n\nI'm not jumping on the bandwagon when I say this movie is nearly perfect. It really is. The performances are great, the directing is great, the editing is nearly perfect and the script is even better than those. Birdman would have completely been on my best of 2014 video because:\n\nBirdman gets an A+.",

It was this annoying jazzy drumming score that literally became so obnoxious I couldn't focus on anything else. Also, I hated the ending (the last scene of the movie before the credits). Overall, it just wasn't that good.",

Riggan is haunted by his past. He hears the voice and character of Birman in his head taunting him... It is like his Lady Macbeth. The show's previews are a disaster, despite the presence of wunder-kind Mike (Edward Norton) to share his stage, and Riggan struggles with the challenges of both the production and keeping a grip on reality. Birdman is an impressive visual journey. Though the story is a bit bonkers at time, it is also very interesting and the performances are quite compelling, especially that of Edward Norton. Its editing ensues that that it almost appears as one single take, which is simultaneously compelling and distracting. ] Intellectually, it explores the nature of celebrity with its tongue-in-cheek casting and commentary, however, there is also much about the role of theatrical art.",

            "content": "Magical realism, if you will, and at its most visceral, guided by endless tracking shots down backstage corridors, starring a man who can move and destroy items with only his mind.  That man is Riggan Thomas (Michael Keaton), an aging Hollywood star who struck success with a series of superhero films (he was Birdman).  Now, he is trying to redeem himself by writing and directing a version of a Raymond Carver short story for Broadway - but everything is falling apart, himself included.  That's the plot, briefly, but it is difficult to convey the force with which director I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and the cast throw everything at the viewer.  As the camera glides along, so too do various ideas and associations get thrust into your stream of consciousness. Sure, we think about Keaton as an ex-superhero whose career is winding down and Norton as a possibly intense and difficult to work with asshole.  But questions of truth, performance, reality, and fantasy (not to mention problematic psychological breaks) are never far from the forefront.  Shot in a month with incredibly long takes and then edited in two weeks (if I've got my facts right), the result is nothing short of amazing.  Keaton impresses as a man just barely holding on (to everything) and Norton, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, Andrea Riseborough, and Zach Galifianakis manage to keep the emotional intensity of the picture at a fever pitch in support.  And just when you thought there was no way to end the picture without copping out, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu teases the audience with numerous possibilities and manages one that works.  A tour de force.",

            "content": "Birdman is an odd mixture of psychedelic introversion and hard bitten reality, vacillating wildly between the two states without really giving you time to adjust. Broadway actor and director Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is living in the past, man, or rather the past in the form of a giant hallucinatory birdman is living in him. Once upon a time, he used to be said Birdman, star of three epic superhero films and Gen X darling of the screen. Now, that's history and he can't come to terms with it. Who could when there's a giant bird living in your head?\n\nThis film drags you with gritty realism through the dressing rooms and back streets of New York's world of theatre, most of it not very pretty at all and much of it produced in what seems to be one long documentary-style, follow-me-with-the-camera-as-I-do-whatever-it-is-I'm-doing take. Which is clearly impossible to manage without careful scripting and repeated efforts to get it right, but that's obviously how it's meant to feel. It's on the 'live' stage, however, that the film's most compelling moments occur. The acting is delivered with an intensely manic vibe and features some gruelling interaction between Keaton, Ed Norton and Naomi Watts, with some equally powerful backstage dramatic scenes involving those three plus the likes of Emma Stone and Zach Galifianakis.\n\nFor me, the most resonant chord echoing powerfully throughout the film is the metatextual, unspoken comment on Keaton's own career. After his unforgettable performance as Beetlejuice in 1988, Keaton agreed to play Batman in the following year's eponymous film, once again under the direction of Tim Burton. He reprised the role in 1992's 'Batman Returns' and was meant to appear as the Dark Knight for a third time in 1995's 'Batman Forever'. But Burton was dropped as director for that project and Keaton followed him through the exit door...and has never been seen again in anything remotely important. Until now, that is. Clearly, Birdman = Batman, in case you needed the dots joined for you.\n\nThis is a film that is really two stories in one. On the surface, it's an abrasive account of the shallowness and superficiality that pervades professional theatre, of the massive egos that occupy its spaces, of the dizzying highs and the terrifying lows that come with the territory, of the bitterness and bewilderment of once having been someone and now being no one. Beneath that, though, it's the story of a man with something that lives deep within him, defining him and only emerging slowly as the film progresses, rising eventually and powerfully from the ashes like the proverbial phoenix. The final scene, in which Sam Thomson (Stone) rushes to the window to look for her father, looking down to where his earthly body clearly lies then looking up to where his alter-ego has evidently taken flight, all without showing us anything but the emotions that pass across her captivating face, is simplicity, brilliance and poignancy all rolled into one.\n\nBirdman deserves to win several Oscars later this month, and it is nominated for nine. There is some stiff competition, as always, but I'm hoping that Michael Keaton, at least, can pull off the big one after a much vaunted career of frustrations that spans my entire adult life. He is a superb actor and this is a superb film.",

Scene transitions are so seamless that the whole movie seems to be one long shot by a single camera. I found myself suddenly realizing the story had move ahead in time, sometime minutes, sometimes hours or sometimes weeks. That was amazing. \n\nI found it disturbing that the film so accurately captured how it feels to be teetering on the ragged edge of sanity where it is hard to tell the difference between real and unreal. I had the unfortunate experience of having an Adderall  prescription for ADHD that sent me to place like that. Unlike the character in the story, I knew I was in trouble and didn't believe the unreal things I saw and held on 5 long days for the medicine to wear off. This movie brought back that terrible experience in realistic detail. So, if you want to know what it feels like to go crazy, this is the film for you.\n\nOn the surface this seems like an old story - the comeback of a forgotten hero - but it is made fresh in a new and interesting way. The acting is spectacular too with truly gifted actors giving their very best performances.\n\nI think this movie will win the Oscar, not because it is entertaining to the general public, but because it is a revolutionary movie in the movie industry. This could be a new \"Citizen Kane.\" \n\nHowever, I think the average moviegoer will not like it. If your preference in movies runs in the categories of action, romance or family friendly then stay away.",

It also works as a social satire, fantasy and unique look into the workings of a Broadway play. It has one of the best ensemble casts of the year and is filmed in a way like no other movie you've seen.\n\nIt is a comeback piece for long-forgotten actor Michael Keaton ?who plays Riggan Thomson, a washed up actor who was once famous for playing a superhero called Birdman in the early 1990s (which makes it seem as Keaton is playing himself) who is attempting a comeback directing and starring in a Broadway play with the movie's events unraveling in the days leading up to the play's opening night. Riggan is a borderline-crazy, haunted soul dreading his existence and battling his own ego and alter ego Birdman (who speaks in a deep voice reminiscent to Batman). \n\nThe movie is a great acting showcase particularly for Keaton in the kind of flashy comeback role that critics and Oscar voters love. My favorite performance from the movie, however, has to be Edward Norton in a very different performance as Mike an eccentric last minute replacement actor who gives Riggan the run for his money. He always seems the utterly crazy one in Riggan's presence. Emma Stone is also good but for the most part true to her form as Riggan's former junkie daughter who is also his assistant. Her performance is elevated only by a long monologue where she preaches her dad. Cast also includes an almost unrecognizable Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's lawyer and best friend, Naomi Watts as an actress making her Broadway debut who is Norton's love interest, Andrea Riseborough as another actress who is Riggan's girlfriend and Amy Ryan as his ex-wife. Watts and Riseborough's characters feel at times awash in the movie's midst and are somewhat underdevelopment especially with a mid-movie plot development involving the two ladies - that's probably the movie's only quibble.  \n\nThe movie is a landmark achievement for director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (\"Amores Perros\", \"21 Grams\", \"Babel\") with the movie shot in a way as if it is all one unedited continuous take (kudos to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki right off his Oscar for \"Gravity\" last year, which really works well with the movie. ? The drum-based soundtrack by Antonio Sanchez is also groundbreaking and suits the film's vibe perfectly. It is shame the Academy didn't deem it eligible due to it sampling some classical music. And then there's that movie's final shot that keeps you thinking. Nominated for 9 Oscars: Picture, Director, Actor (Keaton), Supporting Actor (Norton), Supporting Actress (Stone), Original Screenplay, Cinematography, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing.",

Michael Keaton being cast as Riggan Thompson was inspired, who could possible connect closer to this role than the man who played Batman twice?  describing the real nature of the film and its appeal, one has to recognize who the TRUE audience of this film is.  No question about it, this is a film for actors and people in the entertainment industry.  The average person who doesn't act on stage or film can get a glimpse at some of the narcissistic traits of the principles in this film, but it isn't really a film for everyone.  It has a lot of great parts to it, but what the film fails to do is truly set up a protagonist you really want to root for.  Ed Norton plays a character who is both scene stealing and undeniably unlikeable.  But each of the principle performers are given an opportunity to shine.  Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Norton, Keaton, even Galifianakis, they all have very great scenes to show their tremendous skill.  The film asks a few industry questions to stew on, like the conflict between the art and the celebrity. Understandably such a film was well received in its industry.  But film maker navel gazing doesn't necessarily resonate with the average person.  The film is a solid R film, not family entertainment.  As a dark comedy it is not laugh out loud funny, but still a solid work worthy of some acclaim.  A singular piece, I doubt you'll see another film like it.",

            "content": "Michael Keaton playing an actor who at one point was at the top of the box office in his role in one of the original superhero movies, is so close to reality that it has to be more than a coincidence. This was a  conscious decision on the part of director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, to cast the man who played the original (modern day) Batman and basically kicked off the Super Hero blockbuster genre. And I love that Keaton did it, being so derivative of his own life. \nWith a star studded cast, everybody brought their A game to Birdman. Edward Norton plays a pretentious broadway actor, and a dick, as he tends to do so well and does again here. But you can't help but like him. Emma Stone is probably one of the only chicks out their that can make looking like a drug riddled skank look so good, and turns in a sterling performance here as Keaton's daughter, Sam. Then of course Michael Keaton is just fantastic in his role as Riggan, aka Birdman. I love the way Keaton's brain looks like it is ticking over as you see his character trying to deal and understand with the problems of running a broadway show and facing his own self doubts. He is deservedly up for an Oscar in this role. \nBut probably the most impressive thing about this movie, is the way that it is shot. Made to look like the entire movie is all one continuous take (save a few time lapses here and there) the cinematography and directing is just flat out unbelievable. I have never seen anything like this, and for a style that could potentially make things feel slower, Inarritu instead brings a fast paced energy with his well choreographed shots. Scenes seamlessly blending in and out of each other as the players come and go, highlighting how stressful things are becoming. If this doesn't own Best Cinematography at the Oscars, I will be dumbfounded. And I like that it hasn't been a selling point for the film, normally movies that take the 'one shot' approach use it as a gimmick and the story lacks for it. Bit that is definitely not the case here. With a spectacular script, Birdman is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It's ambiguous ending may have a few people scratching their heads, but I like it. It's one of those endings, not unlike Prisoners or Inception that will make for great conversations as people compare their own interpretations of it.\nYou must see this in cinemas. \n\n4.5/5\n\n 'You aren't doing this for the art, you're doing this to feel relevant again' - Sam",

I love her dearly but her role in this is so small its quite laughable she is up for a nomination in a supporting role. \n\nI think it may still be a top-three front runner for Best Picture. Having seen Boyhood and Whiplash, two movies I rated 9/10, this is a distant third in my books. Whiplash was just great. Boyhood was stunning in that it had that gimmick about the 12 years and it was actually moving. Birdman has its own gimmick: the one-take shot thing. It looks as though the entire movie was shot in one take. I thought it an unnecessary and detrimental gimmick, but reading up, I guess the emphasis was that theater is one take so they did this movie about theater with the \"one take.\" Bleh. I thought it made it less interesting. \n\nSo I really don't see what's great about this at all. Not as a best picture, leading male role, supporting male role, supporting female role, screenplay, or sound mixing...those drums were so terribly annoying. Best Director..sure, throw him out there because of the one-take gimmick.",

            "content": "Birdman is narcissistic. In a fit of self-righteousness, it has decided to eschew current trends, scorn social media, and travail constantly towards being \"real.\" In its mind, the film is a martyr, a revolutionist standing up for what needs to be said. It seems to think that saying something loud enough and long enough constitutes taking a brave, bold stand. In reality, the film is simply a regurgitation of popular nonconformist sentiments. The filmmakers aren't fighting for the current state of entertainment, they are fighting for Birdman. In turn, the film is arrogant, egotistical, pretentious, heavy-handed, self-centered, abrasive, and in the end, to use a label that Riggan Thomson hates, lackluster.\n\nLackluster is the last thing the filmmakers of Birdman were attempting to accomplish. The film couldn't be any more in your face. The cinematography by the unparalleled Emmanuel Lubezki is, well, unparalleled. There isn't a single other DP in the business who can do what Lubezki does with such precision. The film is shot to look like one continuous take, an accomplishment that is very impressive indeed. But much like the film itself, it's technically stunning but ultimately distracting and empty. I get the reasoning behind the camera work, in an attempt to merge the worlds of film and stage, one shot more accurately symbolizes the theatre. But it does not service the best interest of the story. It proves noticeably distracting. Instead of \"making you feel like you're actually there,\" the technique ushers in a certain level of detachment. I didn't feel like I was present during the film, I just felt like I was being dragged along for the bumpy ride. But of course, director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu would prefer to incapacitate his audience with over-the-top filmmaking techniques to hide the fact that Birdman is a cold and haughty film, almost entirely devoid of human emotions.\n\nAfter the cinematography, the performances are the film's second calling card. And once again, they are often magnificent fiascos. There is an abundance of great acting to be found here, but it is so often misplaced and ineffective. The acting in the film feels very much like the theatre. It has all the bombast of the British acting style, but little of the finesse and potency of \"the method.\" I\u00f1\u00e1rritu would much rather show Riggan thrashing around his dressing room, or Riggan and Edward Norton's Mike Shiner wrestling in their underwear, than to actually have his characters experience moments of reflection. The movie huffs and puffs and assumes that the best way to impact an audience is to scream in their face.\n\nOnce again, that's not to say that there aren't terrific performances in Birdman. Michael Keaton does some wonderful acting (the more Michael Keaton the better!), but the performance is often pointed in the wrong direction. Emma Stone does some of her best work here, with one particularly show-stopping monologue. I've been waiting for another performance from Andrea Riseborough ever since she stole the show in Oblivion, and she is a stand-out once again. Zack Galifianakis also does a wonderful job keeping his character grounded. And while I wasn't entirely a fan of the aimlessness of Mike Shiner, I am 100% in accord with those who lobby for an Oscar nomination for Ed Norton. He deserves it.\n\nI can't comprehend how anyone who earlier this year enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy could simultaneously say that they enjoy Birdman. The two films are diametrically opposed. Now, I have just as much distain for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Transformers 4 as the next guy. But I also have no patience for the bitter and broad strokes the film paints with. Once the cinematography and acting are looked past, the movie is trying to say something. The film is very much about the Hollywood/Broadway divide. The real art and acting invention of the theatre, versus the celebrity and explosions of the movies. In the most insulting and pretentious moment of the film, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu sardonically points to his audience and says, \"People? They love blood! They love action! Not this talky, philosophical bullshit.\" A comment like that applies directly to Birdman and its audience, and it is really, gratingly pompous. The movie can shake its fist at excessive superhero filmmaking all it wants, but it has absolutely nothing new to say and certainly no groundbreaking commentary to provide.\n\nOn a side note about the whole superhero thing, Birdman thinks that referencing actual current actors and movies is a stroke of brilliance, that it somehow gives the film another point on the \"masterpiece\" plane. Riggan makes note of Robert Downey Jr. making billions of dollars with Iron Man and The Avengers. And yet, the film casts Emma Stone who, obviously, played Gwen Stacy very recently. Taken a step further, Ed Norton actually shared the same cinematic universe as Downey Jr.'s Iron Man! So, if The Avengers exist in Birdman's world, then so too must The Incredible Hulk, and so too must Edward Norton. So who the heck is this Mike Shiner character? Now, I'm sure that if I liked this movie, I would love these references. It's all one big meta joke, right!? Right? ...Right.\n\nThen there is another thematic layer of Riggan himself. Throughout the film, Riggan is constantly fighting \"The Birdman,\" the personification of big Hollywood, his ego, and the very superhero movies the film detests. But in typical fashion, the movie has no idea what to say with its pulpit. Towards the end of the film, it appears as if Riggan finally gives in to the Birdman. He accepts his ability to be a movie star over toiling on the stage. Or does he? The movie quickly throws (what I understand to be) its symbolism right out the window. It feels like the film chooses each scene based on optimal Oscar bait potential, and less in adherence to plot.\n\nThe following paragraphs will contain spoilers, be warned... As the film draws to its first close, Riggan prepares for opening night of his play. In the performance's finale scene, he is supposed to shoot himself in the head (fake gun and blood, of course). Instead, Riggan decides to actually shoot himself on stage. And he does. But when he does, the film finally breaks from its continuous shot. It goes into a dream-like scene, with painfully ham-fisted symbolism. In a daze, we see a Broadway stage, but instead of actors, we see Transformers and superheroes battling it out on the stage. In the moment when Riggan shoots himself, he becomes popular, a sensation, he goes viral. In the fallout, stage and screen have merged. Riggan has spent the entire movie striving towards his perception of the legitimacy of the theatre, only to have his efforts rewarded with a \"celebrity\" style reaction. The film's ideology, once again, becomes baffling. Is I\u00f1\u00e1rritu trying to say that popularity is what's truly wrong with Hollywood? And if so, that is an infuriating mindset that completely disregards talent and craft, just because it is popular.\n\nThen there is the matter of the film's ending. There were three possible points where I\u00f1\u00e1rritu could have broke off the story. The first point would have been a daring and dramatic finish, an abrupt, thought-provoking conclusion I could definitely get behind. But the film continues on. The second ending would have been ... happier. Twisted, but still on the positive side. But yet again, the movie drags on. Instead of ending the film on one of two separate but acceptable points, the movie goes for an oh so masterful ambiguous ending. Of course, it's classic Birdman horse crap. One last shot at the half-baked symbolism that has pervaded the film.\n\nThe movie's musical score is another prominent example of the failure of Birdman. The original score, composed by jazz musician Antonio S\u00e1nchez, consists almost entirely of drums. Drumming, drumming, drumming, on and on for two hours. It's a bold idea, but in typical Birdman style, senseless and detracting. There were multiple times over the course of the film where the music noticeably makes the experience worse. Scenes of important dialogue and character introspection are ruined by aggressively intrusive crashing and pounding. Classical music is occasionally used, to much better ends than the drum score. Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2 is easily the stand-out musical cue.\n\nBirdman is, without question, the biggest disappointment of 2014. Underneath all of its crashing, screaming, and condescending, there isn't a beating heart. The film's antiquated, \"get off my lawn\" mentality towards modern media wears thin after, oh about thirty seconds. It's easy to get twitterpated by the admirable camera work, but to focus on that is a disservice to the film's thematic ambitions. Yes, the movie deserves to be examined, if only to hinder bandwagon hoppers from exalting a film that so acerbically belittles absolutely everything that is \"mainstream.\" Much like Riggan Thompson, Birdman is painfully unfunny, loud, and angry, desperately flailing about for some semblance of significance. And then it shoots itself in the head, and we have to pretend to care.\n\n\"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige.\" 5/10",

            "content": "Birdman: A Smart Movie with a Stupid Ending\n\nThere is a movie making the rounds of the award shows about an actor who was last widely known for playing a famous superhero in tights. He is attempting a comeback doing something artsy, not unlike Michael Keaton in Birdman. Because it's self-reflexive, it must be FABULOUS! Well, not so much. But it is usually smart and oft entertaining. Like a piece of lesser-known theater, it has its moments. \n\nThere are some things that are fabulous in Birdman. First, the bits of magical realism throughout the film work quite well, until the ending. Second, there is Ed Norton chewing up the scenery with controlled, skillful over-acting. And last on the list of the fabulous is the jazz drumming that follows the actors as they wind their way through the maze of rooms: dressing, make-up, costumes, and through the stage rigging, the lights and other tools of the trade found backstage at a Broadway theater. \n\nThe other acting is as good as its script allows. Emma Stone is fun as Sam, Riggan's (Birdman) daughter, but her petulance becomes irksome after awhile. We fail to see one moment of genuine emotion from the character, even when showing her concern for her father. Her father, Riggan, is played adequately by Michael Keaton, but the famous actor down-on-his-luck schtick is tiresome. Riggan takes himself so seriously that he is a bore. Somehow, I believe that was NOT the intent of the director/writer I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. \n\nNaomi Watts is adequate, but her character's lines about trying to \"make it on Broadway\" were repeated too many times for me to care. It wasn't so much her acting that annoyed me, her hackneyed and out of place dialogue. If she improvised them, well, then it was her acting. \n\nZach Galifianakis was surprisingly not the most annoying one in the movie this time. He plays the straight man, the producer of the play, to counterbalance all the lunacy of the actors. He keeps it together and does a fine job. \n\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu is making an artistic comeback himself as the writer and director of \"Birdman\", not receiving this much acclaim since his first feature, \"Amores Perros\", a much more compelling drama. \"Birdman\" is interesting and clever with all its metaphor and fantasy. The problem is that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu could not get away from magical realism long enough to make a coherent ending. And as we all know, a terrible ending can turn a good film into a mediocre film. That, unfortunately, is what happens to \"Birdman.\" It's treatment is so unusual, but its theme of a washout actor making a comeback so worn out, that a cogent ending was needed to make it work.  \n\nThe camera work and editing are excellent, as are the sets.  The script is at times brilliant and at other moments, mundane. Another run-through by actors and other writers may have brought some needed realism to the magic on the screen. As far as New York goes, the city plays its part well, as always. \n\nRating: Matinee\n\nIt's fair, but for a better, harder hitting film featuring a washed-out actor, rent \"Sunset Boulevard.\"\n\nPeace, \nTex Shelters",

            "content": "One of the best movies I've seen in years. Birdman is a modern fable of the Icarus story mixing with the style of Hitchcock but in a scenario of Singing in the Rain. Riggan is an actor who still believed that he was \"relevant\" to the public but  he has become forgotten by nearly everyone about his old superhero movies in the 70s. He decided to adapt a play about love with the help from his estranged drug addict daughter. But as the days pass, his chance to become popular again became slimmer and slimmer, he must start to reconsider his stance and experience and deal with the chaotic actors and crews.\n\nThe film heavily used drum music, particularly the ambient, jazz era variety. Music was really important as the film was set in New York where the American exceptionalism was prevalent like in the Great Gatsby. Other music were also used to express the mood of the atmosphere, masterfully. Diegetic sounds were used cleverly too to create the illusion of being physically involved in the film.\n\nThe script was superb, dark yet brutally hilarious. It involved all sorts of comedies available: blue, black, slapstick, shock, embarrassing, bizarre, etc. All the characters had distinctive characteristics making them memorable and well developed. The film was about the culture of fame seeking but also satirized the superhero genre (A genre that is getting out of hand with mediocre writing, pretty faces and lots of CGI and action, e.g. Iron Man). Riggan represented Icarus (Birdman) who flew too close to the sun but began to crash and burn due to the wings catching fire from the intense sunlight. Schizophrenia was also heavily suggested, reality became distorted as his worldview crumbled.\n\nI absolutely love the non stop tracking shots, which was used similarly to Rope by Hitchcock. The minimalism also took influence from the master of suspense. The film was unique in it's ability to confuse the audience, e.g. the camera suddenly stopped moving (audience could hear what going on in the next room) but then everything made sense as Riggan returns. \n\nBirdman is not merely a film, it's a piece of sophisticated philosophical art.",

            "content": "\"Birdman\" is probably one of the most hyped of movies of this awards season, however, the only word I can find to describe the film is overrated. \"Birdman\" follows washed-up actor, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) of former superhero glory, as he stars in a risky Broadway play in an attempt to revive his flat lined career. As opening night approaches, Riggan faces a crisis when one of his castmates is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an unpredictable, yet talented actor (Edward Norton) who causes problems for Riggan. Meanwhile, Riggan has to deal with his druggie daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), his ex-wife, and his inner demons that constantly torment him. Although the acting from the cast is superb, (especially from Keaton and Stone), \"Birdman\" is cheapened by the portrayal of Riggan's inner struggle, which is presented onscreen as a massive Birdman who torments Riggan in an overdramatic, almost laughable, Batman-esque voice throughout the film. In addition, Riggan's unstable mental state is expressed in the form of telekinesis powers and an ability to fly, which made me take the film a whole lot less seriously. However, I must admit that the directing side of the film was extremely impressive. The whole movie is filmed to appear as one long shot, with no cuts, resulting in a seamless, unique, and satirical look at society's obsession with celebrity culture and staying relevant. \n(http://joannalynch.weebly.com/)",

After seeing the horrible and over-hyperd Boyhood and the lackluster Gone Girl, this was a much needed glimmer of hope.\n \nThis film grabbed my attention from the get-go. It was a mish mosh of arthouse, big-budget, independent but with a theatre feel to it. I was about 5 mins in before I had to ask myself, 'Is this all one shot?!\"  The film flowed scene to scene effortlessly, giving the feeling of one continuous shot, a remarkable feat by director, cinematograher and editor (all deserving of awards). It gave a sort of theatre atmosphere to the film that brought you into their world and made you feel like a fly on the wall, observing but not intruding.\n \nThe dialogue was well-written and the acting performances all around were top notch. Michael Keaton is phenomenal, as he portrays an actor in the twilight and dwindling years of his career, trying to stay relevant and risking everything to do so. His alter-ego subconcious plays a significant role in his psyche that appears to affect the world around him. It gives us a glimpse into his world and allows us to better understand the character.\n \nYou can easily tell that a lot of planning, consideration, care and thought went into making this film. It's not a gimmick, but an amazing accomplishment by everyone involved in the making of.  It's not a movie that needs to be explained or defended, it stands on it's own, delivers a clear message, but still leaves a little personal interpretation for the audience.\n \nFor those of us who grew up with Keaton films, there's the added nostalgia and links to his film past as the Batman and his alter-ego (Birdman) almost as a Beetlejuice feel to it. I can't say enough good things about his performance, watching him reminded me of what real acting should be and I have no doubt that his co-actors raised their game to this new standard. \n \nThe arthouse-like score blended the film together from beginning to end, giving a more anxious feeling and sense of urgency, appropriate to the scenes and story. There were few slow spots in the film, but were necessary for the audience to relax before bringing us back into the moment. The SFX were very well done and again, major kudos have to be given considering this appeared to be a single shot throughout (I'm still blown-away by it).\n \nNYC was the perfect backdrop; the landscape and sounds virtually took me there and for 2 hours I forgot I wasn't.\n \nThis is a must-see film for anyone (except those who only like $200 million Michael Bay action/explosion-porn movies). Easily in my top 5 of all time",

The mind blowing and overwhelming development might make the audiences to feel that this film about art and life is imitating Nolan's style of cinematography, but the ambiguous ending has rather more complex which gives the opportunity to the audiences to decide whether to end it positively or negatively.",

            "content": "\"I thought I knew what this movie was about. I was wrong\" A man in the row behind me said these words during the first scene of Birdman. That made two of us. I thought Birdman was about a washed up superhero movie star trying to revive his career on stage. And at least on the surface it is. But that barely scratches the surface. Birdman is one of the most complex and multilayered films I've ever seen. There are deep glimpses inside the human mind, reflections on the nature of entertainment and art, scenes straight out of Terry Gilliam's Brazil or Walter Mitty, and all of it is hilariously funny and completely insane.\n\nNow most movie reviews start by telling you what the movie is about, but I'm afraid I can't do that. I can't tell you what this movie is about, because it is about so many things at once and because words simply cannot do this movie justice. You absolutely have to see this movie for yourself. I mean that. Whatever you're doing, get up and buy tickets to this movie right now! Sorry, I didn't mean to be pushy, it's just that I just finished watching this movie and it's really got me worked up. It's that good.\n\nAlright, that last paragraph was a little crazy. But I meant for it to be, because that will help prepare you for how crazy Birdman is, because it is utterly insane. The people in this movie are crazy. They say whatever they think, which frequently includes thoughts that would never go through a normal person head.  They do whatever they feel like, no matter how inappropriate. Ed Norton's character is especially shameless on this count. He will hit on any woman, anywhere, anytime. If something bothers him, he will act out in the most outrageous ways, no matter how many people are watching. He is the ultimate Broadway prima-donna, with no self control, unlimited ego, and the unshakeable conviction that he knows true art. In short an unbalanced A-hole who happens to act brilliantly.\n\nWhen it comes to crazy though, he's got nothing on Riggan, the former Hollywood action star turned Broadway hopeful. Riggan is on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown. And much like Bruce Wayne, he has the voice of his costumed alter ego stuck in his head, reminding him of what they had together and mocking what he's become. And he may also have telekinetic powers. The movie isn't entirely clear on that point.\n\t\nSo this is a very unconventional role to say the least, and Michael Keaton is brilliant in it. He perfectly embodies every facet of the role: the endearing insanity, the anger and frustration, the ego and arrogance, the fear of being an old, washed up has-been. He does things in this movie that few actors of his stature would agree to do. He puts everything he has into this role, and a big part of it is that in a way he's playing himself. This is the guy who did the first two Batman movies after all. And come to think of it, the same is true of Ed Norton. His temperamental prima-donna is the embodiment of every story floating around Hollywood about how hard to work with.\n\t\nAdd Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's frazzled lawyer Jake and the charming Emma Watson as his longsuffering daughter Sam, and the casting in this movie is perfect. So are the writing, direction, editing, and everything else about it. The screenplay blends the real and the fantastic until you can no longer tell them apart. The pacing is flawless, alternating between the serious and the outrageous so that neither becomes overwhelming. The dialog in this movie is more offbeat and maybe more realistic than Tarantino's. And the camera hovers beside the actors, matching their pace and looking over their shoulders so that you almost feel you're standing in the room with them. \n\t\nAnd oh how this movie can deconstruct. It thoroughly dismantles the realities of acting; the jealously, egos, and clashing personalities, the overlapping worlds of stage vs. screen acting, and the very act of pretending to be someone you're not. It shrewdly examines the jaded and cynical critics, the entertainment driven news cycle, the public's current obsession with the superhero genre, and our addiction to smart-phones, YouTube, and all things viral, and what it might mean for older forms of media. In a movie where a guy in a latex bird suit follows the star around there's even time to ponder the true meaning of art. This film deconstructs all of show biz in greater detail than Unforgiven did the old west.\n\t\nAlejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu simply cannot get enough praise for what he has produced. Birdman is deep, outrageously funny, utterly insane, sometimes downright poignant, and awesome in every way imaginable. I would consider it the best movie of 2014. Like I said earlier, go see it.",

This masterpiece really did do the job\nyou want from film and the story and acting and cinematography among\nother things, are just perfection and it has been a long time since a\nblack comedy has really come close to absolute flawlessness.\n\nOne major point about this movie is Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson\n(and Birdman) and his performance here really typifies what acting can\ndo to us the viewer as we feel not only his emotions but also the true\npower great acting is. The cast is to be fair absolute excellence\nalongside Keaton and people like Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi\nWatts create such a display I felt this movie is one to watch for\naspiring actors because they create emotion and depth in the they're\nportrayals. \n\nI felt the comedy side flowed beautifully as well and although coming\ninto the cinema screen I did feel almost like this would be overrated\nin terms of laughter, I was sorely mistaken. The word black comedy is\nthrown as a label on many movies these days but this is what I call\ntrue black comedy and even the appearance of Zach Galifianakis as\nRiggan's lawyer Jake just adds to the overall humour we see and manages\nto be a rare film in which funny parts are mixed with dramatic\nbrilliance.\n\nWhat else can be said about Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu other than this\nman creates a movie which far surpasses anything I thought this would\nbe like. He masterfully directs and at times it seems so simple yet not\nthought of and Inarritu locates what inside we really want from a movie\nlike this. He alongside others write a script that is pure gold in the\neyes of not only actors and directors but also for critics and it feels\nalmost impossible to criticise this movie, even with a slightly slow\nbeginning. \n\nThe cinematography just adds to everything I have said and complimented\nand although it may seem a stupid arsty move with the continuous shot,\nIt just lets you delve in to the action and really not only makes you\nfeel your there, but it also brings a certain reality to fictional\ncharacters who by the end you actually start to care and feel about.\nEmmanuel Lubezski at the time of writing this review is at the top of\nhis game still and whatever he does in the future, it can be assured\nwith movies like this that he will always have a part in academy award\nwinning film.\n\nDon't go into this thinking \"Oh it is looks too dull\" or as if only\ncritics like this type of movie because this movie is a force and the\npowerful performances can just light a spark in your eyes and it bursts\ninto life. I think for many this truly raises questions about the\nquality of movies especially in Hollywood and how something like this\ncan just point out where in the last maybe decade, CGI and big budgets\nhave over taken true cinema storytelling made by people who seem to\ncare.\n\nI think with my grade of 10/10 it means I just felt this was perfection,\nand if this was truly a piece of school or university work then I would\nhave no choice but to declare this astounding. Although my review seems\nkind of a bit crazy and over the top, the movie will make you feel\nalive again in my opinion and people like Keaton who is so underrated\nin the world of Filmography stick in your mind and the formula of this\nis just comedy and drama and fine acting boiled up into a fine fine\nmovie that in truth should be classed as an epic for future generations\nas we maybe see such films as On the Waterfront or Citizen Kane today.",

The rest of the cast is excellent, each giving career best work (Norton shines a pretentious theater actor with more layers to him while Stone shows the biting intelligence & humor that made a star in the first place).  Inarritu direction is genius, and the 'single-take' look is not a gimmick but a device showing the hectic events of the story.  A slight quibble is the more metaphysical moments of the story stick out (is this guy Birdman for real?) but provides for plenty of thought afterwards.

Everything looks improvised but it's not really. Everything here is purposeful and I am in no position to say much after only one viewing but I'm going to try.\n\nEveryone does a stellar acting job and I love the writing,  the soundtrack, and the way it was shot. No breaks until the end and you feel cramped and trapped in this reality the same way Reegan is. He's seeking happiness but as his ex wife says, he thinks happiness is admiration and he can't get that. He's a blockbuster actor (washed up but still) playing in Broadway's world and he is not at home or welcome here. Edward Norton's character makes that wonderfully clear as does the critic. \n\nThe theme there between hollywood and Broadway is also done to great effect as well. The big scene with Birdman suggesting a new film is fantastic and the ending is delightfully absurd but oh so true.  The actual ending also a bit of a head scratcher but I have my own ideas and I'll keep them to myself for the sake spoilers but there are theories.\n\nThe use of \"what we talk about when we talk about love\" is also really interesting and it worth a separate entry.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Black Swan and Taxi Driver in many ways and if anyone wants to chat i am more than game. I really want to see this again. \n\nIt was really well done and really interesting. Everything thing is really tight and really intentional and i'm looking forward to puzzling over it.",

That may sound complicated, and for the first twenty or so minutes of the film while you're getting your bearings it is, however, once you see how the film is broken up into these collections of long, no cut, one take shots, as the camera swoops through the backstage of a Broadway set, you find yourself in awe at the sheer brilliance of it. I would definitely recommend Birdman for anyone who truly enjoys film-acting, directing, dialogue, etcetera. Along with Boyhood and Whiplash, Birdman is one of the top films of 2014 and beyond.

I'm not even here.\n\nBirdman habla de la vida de Riggan, un actor que fue famoso por su papel de superh\u00e9roe, y busca de nuevo la fama siendo director de una obra en Broadway. Somos testigos de las dificultades que encuentra en el camino y sus propias inseguridades que lo persiguen constantemente. Birdman m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de una pel\u00edcula es un gran logro de producci\u00f3n. Toda la pel\u00edcula simula que fue filmada en una sola toma y lograr esto requiere una sincronizaci\u00f3n perfecta. Introduce tambi\u00e9n muchos elementos que normalmente no se ven en una pel\u00edcula de Hollywood como por ejemplo esta realidad fant\u00e1stica donde es dif\u00edcil de apreciar que es verdadero o no. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu es un director que no le teme a sus retos y todas sus pel\u00edculas son innovadoras en su propia manera. Birdman es definitivamente la m\u00e1s original de todas. En cuanto a historia, me cost\u00f3 conectarme. Se enfoco demasiado en las tecnicalidades que lleva montar una obra de Broadway y siento que eso le quit\u00f3 un poco de peso a la emocionalidad. Michael Keaton para ser el actor principal fue una opci\u00f3n excelente, porque \u00e9l es Riggan. Fue un actor popular en su \u00e9poca gracias a Batman y luego desapareci\u00f3, por lo cual puede reflejar su propia experiencia en el papel. Emma Stone como la hija rebelde de Riggan me sorprendi\u00f3, porque este papel es completamente distinto a todo lo que ha hecho, y sorpresivamente logr\u00f3 dar una actuaci\u00f3n realista. Zach Galifianakis se luci\u00f3 y se aleja de su fondo com\u00e9dico, Norton tambi\u00e9n se luci\u00f3 y demuestra porqu\u00e9 la longevidad de su carrera y Watts y Riseborough impecables como siempre. Birdman es un buen paso hacia lo que podr\u00eda ser una reinvenci\u00f3n a el tipo de pel\u00edculas que se hacen en Hollywood. Ya basta de las secuelas y de las historias que se repiten una y otra vez. Fue una agradable sorpresa cuando Birdman fue nominada en varias categorias en los Oscar y finalmente ganar como Mejor Pel\u00edcula. Es un gran paso hacia la direcci\u00f3n correcta.",

Riddled with self-doubt, Riggan is constantly at war with the voice inside his head (which manifests audibly as the eponymous superhero he once played). The film depicts the inherent solipsism and vanity in having self-obsessed thoughts and anxieties; but, it also deeply empathizes with the desire to leave behind a meaningful legacy. \n\nA technical marvel, \"Birdman\" is filmed as though it were one continuous shot, adding to the sense of urgency and anxiety. The performances are also top-notch. Keaton's portrayal of existential angst is often brave, raw and vulnerable. Edward Norton is sharp and charismatic as Mike Shiner, an egocentric thespian who embodies the Oscar Wilde quote: \"I love acting.

            "content": "The film is the story of washed up action film star Riggan Thomson played wonderfully by Micheal Keaton. Riggan is most notably known for his roles as Birdman, a superman type action hero from the past. Keaton and his producer  Galifianakis run a small production company that is showing their first Broadway play and start running into a gauntlet of problems. They have to replace the actor opposite of Keaton and Watts. This turns out to be Edward Norton, who plays a theater star and show maker among the New York theater scene. Keaton\u00e2(TM)s daughter is played by Emma Stone. Stone plays a daughter out of loop with her father and his time. She delivers a awes inspiring monologue that earned her an academy award nomination.\n\n\n\nThe further Birdman progresses Riggans descends further into a madness brought on by himself and his lack of self worth. He lives in an age where he has become obsolete in a world of twitter, Facebook, and a new super hero movie coming out every other month. Birdman is a tour de force. The film is a great example of what a great film needs to do to have success and earn acclaim. Bird man is nominated for nine academy awards and won for best picture,director,screenplay, and multiple other awards. The directing of Alejandro G. I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu really compliments the acting of the actors and he demands their full attention and top performances.\n \n\nThe true stand outs of Birdman are Micheal Keaton and Edward Norton. Great films often have multiple great scenes. This defines great films and Birdman has multiple great scenes that one would want to revisit over and over again. I love all the scenes where Riggan is unraveling and his Birdman persona is coming full force. Also Norton\u00e2(TM)s opening scene with him convincing Riggan he should be the fill in is one of the finer acting jobs anyone can pull off. He comes in and out of acting and reality with ease where you have no idea if he knows the difference at times or if he is acting or just going on with life.\n\n\n\nThe score is another huge factor in Birdman pulsing and making you hyped and nervous all at the same time. The constant percussion is unnerving at times and brutally honest for how the characters seem to be feeling.\n\nBirdman is a must watch. Birdman is a 9/10 a true cinema masterpiece with few holes. The dvd just came out so go check it out.\n\nShare this:\nTwitter1LinkedInEmailFacebook2PinterestPrintGoogleTumblrPocketStumbleUponReddit",

I'm not sure though whether what I read misguided my imagination from what I actually seen or the film was so over hyped that what I eventually ended up watching didn't live up to the expectation as predicted.   I ummed and ahhhed over re-watching the film before reviewing it again but in the end have decided watching it again would be unfair and to be an honest review I should write my first thoughts.  Perhaps I'll write a second review sometime in the future, for now though I'm going with my original feelings and thoughts and penning that hopefully this review will leave make way for some great discussions.\n\nRiggan Thompson sits in his dressing room mediating, he hovers about three feet off the ground legs folded and hands in a praying position.  Riggan Thompson was once a great comic book turned movie hero to the film industry with a legion of fans, that was all back in the 1990's. Since leaving half way through the third and fourth films his career took a dive, these days he is a washed up almost forgotten actor so to make his way back to the hearts of his fans and create some new ones he decides he will write, direct and star in an adaption of a Raymond Carver story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".  The play is set to debut in the St James Theatre in New York, 24 hours before the first preview screening one the main actors is injured and can't do the play.  He brings in a very well-known method actor Mike Shiner who has done more than enough to empress Riggan.   During his first preview screening Shiner does the unthinkable and Riggan's world suddenly comes crashing down around him, his estranged relationship with his daughter gets father apart, his best friend turns on him and to top it all off a famous and reviewer has threatened to destroy the play no matter how good it actually is.  With Riggan's \"birdman\" attacking him from the inside slowly Riggan's world becomes more than he can handle but what and how will he make this all work....\n\nThe first and last thing you will notice about this film is that of the amazing camera work, the entire film appears to be shot in one single take which is absolutely stunning to behold, fantastic idea by both the director  Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (21 Grams, Babel) and his lead cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, the second thing you will notice is the brilliant acting by Michael Keaton (Batman, Beetlejuice) who plays Riggan Thompson, he is amazing in his role very believable you almost think that perhaps he isn't at all acting but being himself which must be the sign of a true genius, add to the amazing acting the stunning performance by Edward Norton (American History X, Fight Club) who plays Mike Shinner, I loved his character and thought he really helped the film where it would have otherwise fallen down.   I found the story though very lack luster, almost boring, I personally believe it just tried too hard to be an arthouse but failed, sure it had its moments and the camera work is more than enough to class this film as amazing, as is the acting from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, I felt it needed a lot more though to deserve all the acclaim it's so far received.  Also in the cast is Zach Galifianakis as Jake, Emma Stone as Sam and Naomi Watts as Leslie.\n\nBirdman is a film that needs your full undivided attention, I personally don't believe it will be for everyone, it is a very intellectual film (perhaps that's why I didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else) It's a film that will take you deep inside a man's mind and what makes him tick, it's a film that will wish for that little bit more and lastly I believe it's a film that lies to you especially if you have seen the trailer so don't expect no big budget action film as the trailer leads you to believe.",

This film beats every film whe cinematography is involved it is made like the whole thing is filmed in 1 shot. THE CAMERA NEVER TAKES A BREAK! I couldn't find any editing even though there was editing. Just beautiful to look at. This was by FAR Michael Keatons BEST  performance! The other cast was really great as well. I thought the score was quirky and fun. The screenplay my word the screenplay. The creativeness of Alejandro Innaritu just shined in this story of a washed up movie star who used to play the role of a popular birdlike superhero named Birdman getting his life back together while writing, staring, and directing his own broadway play. He has Birdmans voice stuck in his head telling him to go back to his original role as Birdman so he can be popular cause that's all he wants is popularity and through that the character chemistry with Michael Keaton is fantastically done to where through his fights with Birdman he becomes a better person. It's hard to explain unless you see it. Overall though one of the greatest films of this decade. A perfect film with no negatives WHAT SO EVER!  It has my vote at the awards. I highly recommend Birdman if you haven't seen it see it now,  no I mean now! Best film of the year so this beats the mark and goes higher than a 10.",

Just brilliant! The shooting style of \"Birdman\" makes the film seem like one long and continuous take, which becomes appropriate as you're there through every grueling moment that these characters endure, never quite getting a break from all the drama going on around them. Additionally, the constant use of closeup shots on each character really draw you into their every emotion (literally, delivering an \"in your face\" performance for each part). Technically, this is quite an outstanding movie, however I feel as though the storytelling -  as well as the story itself - may polarize folks who go into this not expecting a layered, philosophical journey... but at least there's some humor to go along with it.",

            "content": "This heavy-going and rarely funny comedy may easily slip through and win the Oscar, being the ultimate in Hollywood indulgence.  Setting itself up as a masterwork of acting, it is unrelentingly self important. On the plus side, it supports the renewal of competent artistic careers; and it gives some idea of an actor's challenges, though the latter is diminished by the sacrifice of reality in the interest of hyperbole. The film's strength is the cast, with the extended takes showcasing talent that we are rarely given to see fully in Hollywood films. The women uplift the film.  Their beauty is spectacular; they speak the truths of the story and each creates a grounded centre of her own, rescuing the film from total posturing. The male roles are more like strutting birds displaying. Keaton blasts through the film in an exhausting panoply of his own tours de force. Mostly these are photographed in tiresome closeup. In a major but typical fail, the screenplay delves into the supernatural. You groan at the beginning and can only hope against hope that it is all in Riggan's head, enough to see you through most of the film. Written as it seems by a committee, the film pecks at everything. A bizarre, eclectic superstructure balances on the one repetitive note of Riggan's career obsession. There are numerous reminders and parodies of other shows - often ironical, but derivative and childish. No doubt it is full of in-jokes and in-innuendo. As for the clunky combination of Hollywood and Broadway, there are reasons why screen acting and theatre acting are different. What it must be to live with your emotions always hurtling ahead, laying waste to everything in their path. Anyone who has undertaken a difficult role in a fragile theatre piece, that was important to them, will feel the anxieties acutely. But it is also true that theatre requires stamina, stoicism, patience and measure.  As indeed does feature film. There is no deus ex machina for actors. The film does not teach much, despite the claims that it is a look behind the scenes. It leaves that reality out of your grasp. If that elusiveness is intended as its subliminal message, it seems untrue, and too easy by far. The ending is lazy. Having clothed itself in some authority, this film misuses it.",

I\u00c3\u00c3,\u00c2\u00b1arritu had been much of an unknown, but after a film like Birdman, he will certainly receive the attention he lacked before. I haven't even gotten to the performances yet. Keaton deserves not only a Best Actor nomination, but the award itself. And if only J.K. Simmons didn't exist Norton would be the Best Supporting Actor in a landslide. This is an excellent film and I enjoyed the ending, but it wasn't perfect. I felt it was a bit confusing that he gained the superpower of the Birdman when he was trying to overcome that label.

These two examples of course being Gravity and Birdman, filmed by the genius Lubezki. Almost seemingly shot all in one go, with the beginning and end as exceptions, simply the artistic feat of the film earns it a place in a film to be looked at for years to come, just like Gravity.\n\nBut let's look at the other aspects that make Birdman one of the best films of the year. All the supporting performances are excellent, especially Norton's, but what surprised me most was the incredible performance by the former Batman superstar. He's certainly grown as an actor, and carries this film by his shoulders. \n\nThe story may be a bit uneven, with a few scenes that last a bit too long, and some confusing time jumps, but it really goes out of its way to be unique - to simply be an important addition to cinema. If only every film tried to be unique and set itself apart, the industry would be a much better place.\n\nAlejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, of course, has to take almost all the credit to assemble such a fascinating study of fame and its psychological tolls on those who aim to achieve it. Great film, highly recommended, and I'll just mention the cinematography one more time.",

A film that makes up for Nicholas Cage flops and box office bombs or even the occasional Wayan brother film.  With 2014, Birdman is that film.  Eminently watchable, thoroughly absorbing, acted on a touching, intuitively humane level, and led with such a distinctive direction that it's near impossible to turn away from, Birdman soars over the viewers who dare miss a minute of the on-screen vibrance and promises to fascinate the rest.  It's hard to argue whether it is the best movie of the year, but I was so taken aback by its visual style and constant flow and focus that I can't say I noticed any flaws with it whatsoever, working the audience in favor of the film for both fans of live and cinematic theater.  Birdman is its own entity of magnificence that has restored my faith in film after an arguably dry and stagnant year in film and strives for and achieves on every level.  Driven by a message that can be respected by all purveyors of film in cheering on the underdog, Birdman is the underdog with the effort and appeal to remind us why film and theater is so vital, but most importantly, why small-time, arthouse productions must also be given a chance.  Thankfully, the Academy has seen to that.",

Now forgotten and irrelevant, Riggan is trying to reignite his career by directing, writing and starring in his own play based on a short story by Raymond Carver. But from the previews to opening night, Riggan's psyche is split between letting the show go on, or letting the bird out of the cage. \n\nBirdman is completely original. You will not have ever see anything like this before. The reason being is the entire film is shown as a single rolling shot, and no cuts. A complete illusion which completely captivates the notion of a Broadway stage show under pressure, following every step of ticking time bomb  From a technological stand point of films, this is mightily impressive.\n\nKeaton and Nortan play the best performances of their careers by far. Particularly a scene where their two characters are practising a scene for the play. The bouncing of spontaneous ideas and raw emotion between the two discussing how to perfect a conversation is incredible.\n\nBirdman is everything I expected it to be; masterful, relevant, unexpected, compelling.

I have to say even though it was chaotic at times and very strange it had a certain flow to it that ended up making sense. Michael Keaton delivers a great performance both dramatic and comedic. He plays a movie actor that was made big by playing a comic book character decades ago named Birdman. He now is trying to become relevant again after many years through doing a stage play from an old book. He encounters life problems, doubts, pressures and competition that makes you wonder if he what he is doing is actually worth it. Edward Norton does also a perfect job of playing a character that gave strife, discomfort and just plain foolishness to his co-stars because of the character's own crazy methods to his acting. An eccentric, eclectic piece of work that you would either like or dislike. I'm glad I got the chance to watch it because I actually did like it. It is vulgar and again weird at times but the story does come together at the end. Bravo to Michael and the director for doing such a risky project. \n\n4 out of 5 stars \u00ef\u00bb\u00bf",

Labeling it as a dramatic psychological comic tragedy would  barely skim the surface of this multi-layered tour de force which features scintillating performances from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and, perhaps best of all, Emma Stone, who almost steals the picture in my opinion. It is not an easy film to watch with a staccato soundtrack played out by a frenetic drummer, a permanently moving hand-held camera and numerous dreamlike sequences which may or may not be actually happening. But it is utterly riveting from start to finish and a must-see for anyone who appreciates a really different kind of movie experience",

            "content": "'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' sets out to tell the story of Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), an aging Hollywood movie star whose fear of becoming irrelevant brings him to Broadway in hopes of reinventing himself as a serious thespian and, naturally, quirk and chaos ensue along the way. \n\nFor Riggan, the production-an adaptation of Raymond Carver's 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,'- is one mishap after the next. His co-star, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) is a pain to work worth, his fresh-out-of-rehab daughter (Emma Stone) constantly reminds him that he's both a washed up actor and a lousy father, and a surly New York Times theater critic decides to hate the play before even seeing it. Then there's Birdman-a superhero Riggan played in the blockbuster franchise that launched his career-who haunts him day in and day out. This ghost of Hollywood past fuels the actor's self-doubt and self loathing, blurs his sense of reality, and eventually, leads Riggan to a full-blown descent into madness. \n\nBut instead, 'Birdman' does a better job at telling the story of an aging movie director, whose fear of irrelevance leads to his own attempt at reinvention through a stab at satire and-because the filmmaker clearly fears failure as much as does irrelevance-clutter, banality and desperation plague, what otherwise, could have been one hell of a movie. \n\n'Birdman' had so much potential. Its stellar cast, featuring Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Zach Galifianakis, among others, collectively delivers solid performances across the board. The cinematography is not only beautiful, but also serves to give the film an uncannily distinct aesthetic from beginning to end-an aesthetic that is further accentuated by an atmospheric musical score, which, consisting predominantly of jazz drum rhythms, captures both the film's midtown Manhattan setting as well as the escalating neurosis of its protagonist. \n\nHowever, in all other respects, 'Birdman' fails to deliver. The movie's most glaring flaw is its complete lack of focus-it simply tries to be too many things at once. \n\nThematically, it appears to aim for dark satire. The cinematography, for instance, which has been praised for giving 'Birdman' the look of one continuous shot the whole way through, is actually remarkable for a different reason-which is that the use of lighting and camera angles makes every scene and every frame look like a comic strip panel, if paused and gone over in pencil. And that's damn fitting for a dark comedy/drama about a man that once played a superhero, and his weird, imaginary superhero frenemy/alter-ego! \n\nIn their roles, Keaton and Norton both poke fun at their real life public personas-Keaton really WAS the star of a superhero film franchise back in the day, and Norton really IS known for being a masterful yet hard-to-work-with actor. It's clever because we like it when actors prove to be in on the joke. \n\nShould 'Birdman' have fully committed to farcical absurdity, the film would have been a live-action, existential comic book for the thinking man-successfully spoofing show business while making a statement about celebrity culture, social media, today's desensitized, bloodthirsty audiences (Riggan gets a rave review from the aforementioned bitter critic only because he shoots his own nose off onstage during his play's premier, thereby \"proving\" himself a true artist), and of course, the destructive capabilities of our own minds. \n\nBut 'Birdman' did not accomplish what it had the potential to do, due to its inability to fully embrace the intended motif. The script and story line didn't allow the leads to be the caricature-esque archetypes the film needed in order to be a dark, comedic parody of actors. \n\nInstead, the stereotypes, particularly those portrayed by Keaton and Norton, were tainted by sporadic (and rather unnecessary) bursts of depth and idiosyncrasy. The result made for a roster of on-screen personalities which were neither one-dimensional enough for satire, yet not developed enough to make for a character driven drama. You neither fully care, nor fully not care about them-and apathy is perhaps the worst kind of emotion a film can illicit. \n\nThe film's lack of follow-through brings me back to, what appear to be obvious parallels between its lead character and its director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Like Riggan, Inarritu, 51, perhaps decided to go against the grain of the heavy dramas that made him famous and prove to viewers that he's still got a few tricks up his sleeve, by dipping his toe into the waters of dark humor. \n\nBut based on the end result, Inarritu wasn't comfortable enough with the genre to fully commit to it, because 'Birdman' is peppered with many of the same dramatic elements that have proven successful with audiences in the past-seemingly just to be on the safe side, but making for a muddled, wishy-washy mess of a movie instead.\n\nInarritu's insecurity is best exemplified by the film's antagonist-a New York Times theatre critic who hates Riggan for daring to set foot on Broadway, which she believes to be reserved for serious actors and not Hollywood sell-outs. She's heartless, callous, uncaring and straight up villainous in her determination to shut down Riggan's production via the power of a bad review. Inarritu gets an A+ for actually not overthinking her as a character, but D- for trying to conceal a built-in deterrent from any real-life bad reviews that his attempt to venture outside his comfort zone could potentially be subject to. It's a cowardly message to critics: I'm going to make you look bad, before you get a chance to make me look bad. \n\nAnd perhaps Inarritu was right to be nervous. He's got the cinematic exploration of the human condition down to a science, but when it comes pop culture and comedy, a natural he is not. \n\nHis previous films, like Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams and even the uncomfortably heavy Biutiful, all feature at least a handful of funny moments-like, actually really funny moments-which work because they aren't forced. In 'Birdman' much of the humor tries too hard-and worse yet, feels like listening to your grandparents trying to sound 'edgy.' \n\nWhen Naomi Watts' character (a member of Riggan's cast whose storyline is feverishly made out to be of great importance to the film in its first 40 minutes, then inexplicably completely ignored for its remainder) cries, \"Why don't I have any self-respect?\" to a fellow female cast member, her friend replies,  \"You're an actress, honey.\" Zing? Oh no, he didn't? Someone's FINALLY dared to call out actresses as being fucked up and vulnerable? The joke kind of seems like the overused, low hanging fruit one would expect from a rom com or Adam Sandler movie-not an Oscar contender. Unfortunately, the film features plenty more examples of such pedestrian humor and is only genuinely funny when Keaton, Galifianakis and Norton deliver unintentionally funny lines in a prodigiously humorous manner-which fortunately, they frequently do. \n\nAnd instead of letting the movie's plot organically serve as social commentary, that aspect is forced as well. Kids today only care about Twitter and going viral, rather than plays and stagecraft. Yes, we've known this for a while and the film's smug use of social media jargon comes off as Inarritu's way of proudly demonstrating that he knows what it is and how it works-and ironically makes the filmmaker look even more out of touch than he would have if he just didn't reference it at all. \n\nActors are tortured, insecure people, incapable of healthy relationships or dealing with reality. Yep, that's also been covered before. \n\nAnd how about the tremendous opportunity the film had to address the escalating insignificance of the New York Times? Instead of lampooning the relic publication's comically out-of-touch ways, the film maintains an antiquated and, no longer existent, level of reverence of a newspaper that's long since become a joke. \n\nIn fact, 'Birdman' manages to insult viewers' intelligence on other levels as well. Take, for instance, the epic spoiler of a line that comes damn near the beginning of the film, in which Mike Shiner (Norton) tells Riggan (Keaton) to have some respect for himself by getting a more realistic-looking gun to use in the play's final scene (in which Riggan's character commits suicide).  The scene lacks so much as even an attempt at subtly. Thirty minutes into the movie and you already know how it will end-the tortured, desperate for actor-cred Riggan is going to shoot himself onstage with a REAL gun.\n\n It would have worked as foreshadowing, had Riggan's attempt at onstage suicide not been the film's conclusion, but rather a pivotal moment which leads to a greater, more profound epiphany, or steered the plot in a specific direction. But no. You are literally (and shamelessly) told at the beginning of the film, exactly how the film is going to end, and are STILL expected to be surprised by its final scenes, you fucking idiot, you! \n\nAll that said, my love and respect for Inarritu remains unwavering despite this cinematic blunder. I do respect his desire to branch out beyond, what has become, \"classic Inarritu.\" And he did...okay, at it. As a fan, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. But at the same time, given his talent, sense of humor (when he's not trying too hard), amount of A list actors at his disposal, and eye for visually sexy filmmaking, Inarritu-whose 'testing the waters of satire' project wound up being a critically acclaimed Oscar contender-is poised to dominate the genre before long, should he choose to do so. Personally, I'd like to see him make a black comedy in which he redeems himself for the shortcomings of the if-it-had-been-directed-by-anyone-else-it'd-be-great 'Birdman.' Which I trust he can. But I also wouldn't be mad if he made Amores Perros 2.",

As a last chance at rekindling his iconic days he is fully financing, acting and directing a Broadway stage production of a Raymond Carver short story. Around him, his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is desperately trying to show him that his method behind his quest for pop culture relevancy is archaic and outdated. Thompson's business partner and agent Jake (Zach Galifianakis) tries to keep his clients ego in check and turns a blind eye to the cracks appearing in this ageing movie stars ego, an ego that lusts for revitalisation and fame. Thompson's ex wife and current lover both have active roles within the theatre he is performing act as well has his deranged acting partner Mike (Edward Norton) who has incredible acting talent but a delicate psyche. Every character has a heavy influence of Thompson's story as he struggles to succeed with his play and regain his stature in the performing arts in the face of a film critic determined to close his show as she feels he is underserving of that iconic stage.\n\nDirector Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's intention was to shoot Birdman as if it was just one long take, and it really feels that way as the story flows perfectly and the editing is virtually invisible. Scenes lasting several minutes - requiring the cast to learn up to 15 pages of dialogue verbatim while also hitting their physical marks and cues - meant Birdman wrapped in less than a month of shooting. It's no big secret that while Birdman is very close to home for Keaton it is also miles away, the character of 'Birdman' represents the career high for Keaton when he played Batman in 1989/92 but in this production the 'Birdman' character, to wit only Thompson can visualise, represents and manifests as his overpowering ego convinced that everybody is trying to impede and restrict him. Thompson rages an internal battle against this 'Birdman' toward a dramatic psychological crescendo that will leave you thinking. Fantastically well made, amazing camera work and indeed career best performance from Keaton. This is exactly the type of movie the Academy loves, it's high brow, it's multi layered and very cerebrial. At time of writing it has 9 2015 Academy Award nomination and I believe it's in with a good shout for either Best Actor/ Best Movie.

            "content": "Every now and then a movie comes out that takes a different approach to the most basic elements of film. In this case the uniqueness lay in the camera format. There are no cuts, everything is shot on one continuous shot that follows the character being focused on at any given time around to create a more real time play-esque atmosphere. Upon first hearing about this, I was intrigued but doubted that over the course of an entire movie that this style would not hold up. But how wrong I was, outside of the few rare occasions when the camera would've benefitted from being a little further back, the angling and continuous drawn out shot work succeed in making Birman a refreshing, daring experience to watch unfold. \nBIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance is a black comedy that tells the story of a fading actor (played beautifully by an uncharacteristically energetic Michael Keaton) famous for his portrayal of an iconic superhero- as he labours to mount a Broadway Play. The days leading up to the opening night show the actor struggling against ego, familial strain, his career and most worrisome of all, his own mind. I found it interesting that Michael Keaton chose this role as it appears to mirror his own career. He of course known to most for portraying Batman in the Tim Burton adaptations in the late 80's and early 90's, has, much like his character done nothing of much consequence in the years since. Going into this film, I was not a Keaton fan. After watching his performance though, I am now firmly on his bandwagon. In every scene Keaton displays a previously untapped energy and feverish passion that forces the viewer to sit up and look on in awe. His comic timing and body mannerisms remain on point from beginning to end and help to stop even the most casual of watchers from losing focus. However, despite his performance, Keaton does not turn in the best display of the film. That honour belongs to Edward Norton. Playing his character (that of a wildly eccentric, pretentious theatre actor) with more gusto than we've seen from him in year, Norton owns every moment of screen time that he is given. Perhaps it was good direction or perhaps it was a strong endearment for the material, but Norton has thrown himself into this role and elevates him to the positon of Oscar contention later this year.\ngood turns are also provided by the supporting cast Zach Galifianakis under plays slightly, while also delivering his punchlines so subtly you'd almost suspect he came up with each one on the spot. While Emma stone plays a tired and worn out trope of modern cinema, the angst wrought daughter with father issues, with enough charm that one can almost overlook the fact that you've heard it all before.\nThe faults of the movie are few and far between. Yet, if I had to nitpick I'd say that the apparitions of Birdman himself could use more clarification. At times you are lost as to whether or not he is real and if Keaton does possess the powers put on show in all the trailers. Another thing to strife over is the occasion social media aspect that gets shoehorned in. Such little is said in relation to the internet you're left wondering; Why bring it up at all?\n\nUltimately, this comes highly recommended. Blending art-house narrative with a mainstream flare perfectly I can't help but feel that this is the movie that \"Synecdoche New York\" had wanted to be but failed in finding the blend between reality and otherwise.

Too many times do people get too carried away by one thing like technical achievements rather than judging the film as a whole. I do have to disagree that the film is well acted. It is over acted. I found myself many times throughout the movie thinking about how evident it was that they were acting - and I'm not talking about the parts on stage. The interactions were unrealistic. This movie reminds me a lot of American Hustle in that the way people talked to each other was way over the top. It was a star-studded cast of actors over-acting. I'd also have to disagree with the entire genre of this movie. It's not a black comedy or even a drama. It's more like a fantasy, partly because of the dialogue, partly because of the content. I would also have to disagree that this is about a midlife crisis. It's more about a psychotic breakdown. I think they just got it all wrong.",

            "content": "\"Birdman\" is really odd but you have to see it.  Its cinematography, which captures the entire film as if it was a single tracking shot, is absolutely stunning and gives the film a unique feel that is unlike any other.  While some trickery is used to create this effect, it still necessitates that each scene be shot in one take as each stop and start of the camera occurs during a transition between scenes.  The tracking shots within each scene can last up to 15 minutes, requiring the actors to be on point with their timing and emotions at every moment while the crew and cameraman must operate with absolute precision.  The Oscars don't lie when it comes to the acting categories and, when a film receives nominations in three of those categories, you know that you are going to see strong emotional monologues and a lot of chemistry.  Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone do not disappoint.  Keaton has spent most of his career dwelling in comedy and action roles that put him in the spotlight but never proved him as a great actor.  Everything changed with the release of \"Birdman.\"  The role of Riggan Thomson has allowed Keaton to put on a dramatic, psychological performance in which he is unpredictable, unstable, and gets to really freak out.  Edward Norton adds to his repertoire of arrogant jerk roles with several high-energy scenes that leave you hating him (as usual).  Emma Stone, who I believe to deserve more credit as an actress than she receives, secured her Oscar nomination with a single scene in which an impassioned monologue allows her to flex her acting muscles.  The supporting cast adds to the natural feel of the film and director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had incredible vision to put this entire film together within a playhouse on Broadway.  He is no stranger to the Oscars as all five of his feature films have received nominations, and this film will surely take home a few.  I do take issue with the trail of loose ends that this story does not resolve.  It is obvious that the writers want the reality of Keaton's superpowers, whether they exist or are in his head, to remain ambiguous.  This results in an incredibly clever ending that forces us to reflect on the characters and decide what happened; however, what is the purpose of including seemingly significant events and never addressing them again?  Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough seem to disappear from the film for no particular reason after \"the scene\", Amy Ryan creates insight into Keaton's character and then also disappears, but why?  I feel like this misuse of characters cheapens an otherwise inspired script.  I like this because it is something different, from its single tracking shot approach to its use of a real Broadway playhouse for its set.  It is rare that a director can create a film that defines its own style, but \"Birdman\" is undoubtedly one of a kind.",

I guess it must be a big deal for a Hollywood superstar to prove to his peers that he is not just a money-making machine but also a talented actor.  However, I truly do not care about the hysterics and anguish of Hollywood actors.\n\nThat is why, when Birdman was acclaimed by the critics I already suspected yet another inflated balloon full of nothing.  I waited until I could watch the movie for free, because I was very reluctant to waste money on yet another \"Academy-worth\" piece of crap and I am very happy I saved my hard-earned money\n \nThe joke is twice on the audience, because the other theme explored by Birdman, besides narcissist actors, is audience stupidity. Not being the sort of person who cares about superheroes movies, I was nevertheless annoyed by the fact that the public of said movies is vilified by this piece of elitist crap. \n\nIt is difficult to point out what I disliked most about Birdman, since I hated everything: the overbearing drum soundtrack, characters shouting their lines, the smugness of the whole concept, the patronizing dialogues, etc... I do not even think Keaton was so great in it.\n\nFinally, it is depressing to notice that the number of movies I want to walk out from is increasing exponentially.

            "content": "Going head to head with Boyhood for the Best Picture Oscar, this quirky meta-dramedy about a washed-up movie star attempting redemption on Broadway has generated much applause from critics around the world. It's not hard to see why, what with director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's ambitious technical achievements, the razor sharp satirical screenplay and a bunch of soul-bearing performances. Presenting the story as one long continuous take, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu employs all the tricks of the trade in search of something unique and it largely pays off; his ever-flowing camera segues between scenes creating a dreamlike atmosphere. Finding where the shots have been joined, however, can at times distract from the emotional journey crafted by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and his team of writers, in a script full of dark humour and irony. Unfortunately there's also a hint of pretention and self-satisfaction in I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's work - intentional and otherwise - that comes across as smug and, therefore, annoying. As Riggan Thomson, the former A-lister seeking professional rejuvenation on the stage, Michael Keaton gets a long-awaited opportunity to shine in a lead role and attacks it, for better and worse, with unbridled gusto. Ed Norton hogs the spotlight though, with a comedic turn as a supercilious stage actor looking for the \"truth\" in even the tiniest of things, whilst Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan round out the impressive cast. Birdman is clever, enterprising and admirably distinct, if occasionally laborious and inaccessible; it's not for everyone, but lovers of film and/or theatre should seek it out.",

A dazzling film on many levels this is a story about lost souls, identity, celebrity and meaning in the world. Michael Keaton is superb as Riggan Thomson, a man searching for answers many years after reaching fame as 'Birdman'. His soul searching takes him to Broadway to star in and adapt Raymond Carver. All the while his inner voice of 'Birdman' is questioning his every move. He seeks answers but can't find them. Throw in a troubled relationship with his daughter and his battles with the ego of his star actor, the great Edward Norton, and you have a potent mix of regret and ambition. This is a sad, dark and funny film. It pokes holes in the modern film world obsessed with comic book adaptations and the world at large concerned with celebrity. To add to the mastery of the film is the sublime cinematography of  Lubezki. He has combined with the director to construct the film as if it shot in one take. The effect is to thrillingly lead you on a non stop journey through the theatre, a theatre of dreams. Of fantasy. This wonderful films plays with big ideas. The fact that it totally succeeds is even more astounding.",

            "content": "Michael Keaton's most recent cinematic turn as Riggan Thomas in Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman is the bravest performance of the year from a leading actor, laying bare all of Keaton's insecurities, vanities, and virtues through a fictional character who possesses more than a passing resemblance to Keaton himself. Riggan is a washed up, out of work Hollywood actor, attempting to breath new life into a public image that has been distorted and manipulated by the cult of celebrity, bringing with it all of the personal vices of arrogance, avarice, and self-absorption that such distortions of self-worth and identity inevitably represent and instill. Likewise, Keaton is a figure of the popular culture who appears as more of a caricature than a three-dimensional actor in the collective mind of the general public, associated with some of the most iconic movie characters from the 1990's, including Batman and Beetlejuice, thereby mirroring Riggan's association in Inarritu's film with the fictional big budget superhero, and at times near literal alter-ego, Birdman. Inarritu's film thus becomes an examination of the blockbuster movie star, simultaneously celebrating and deriding the actor whose relevancy is at times more dependent upon the associations conjured up by the characters he portrays as opposed to the power of each individual performance, Birdman bigger than Riggan, in much the same way that Beetlejuice looms larger than Keaton, in both name and persona. Michael Keaton's cultural status as one of the big budget stars of the 1990's thus becomes a meta-fictional aspect of the very fabric of Innaritu's film, inevitably informing the audience as to how to read Riggan's deeply conflicted interiority and ego-driven flights of astrally projected fantasy, visually represented in the film through Inarritu's use of one continuous, and spectacularly edited, long shot, seamlessly encompassing the entire film, and further mirroring Riggan's subjective vision and reality in a way that is intensely characteristic of the film, the character, and the surreal nature of Inarritu's beautiful meditation on the unexpected virtue of ignorance.\n\nThe frame narrative of Inarritu's film centers around a stage production of the classic American short story collection What We Talk About When We Talk About Love by minimalist writer Raymond Carver, adapted and produced by Keaton's Riggan Thomas in the lead role, providing for an accessible point of entry into the film's visually driven first person narrative, as Riggan's highly subjective point of view very quickly begins to drive the entire course, and at times alter the reality of, the film's plot and cinematic scope. As the camera pans across and through the small, claustrophobic hallways and back stages of New York's Broadway theatre district, the playhouse a veritable Pandora's box of Riggan's artistic dreams, hopes, and delusions, the viewer is swept up in the storm of his creative fruition, bordering on the insanity and emotional fragility that makes up the core of Inarritu's film. When we first see Riggan, he is literally floating in mid-air in his dressing room, a ludicrous first shot that boldly establishes the subjective unreality of the film, and immediately establishes a clear directorial vision, one that will be impossible to outwit or predict, making for a deeply compelling and intimately truthful performance based piece of storytelling. According to the demands of the one shot take that establishes the subjectivity of the narrative, every other actor's performance becomes a part of one long stream of Riggan's conscious and subconscious, each line delivered with the grace and elocution of live theatre, the players all a part of one organism in motion, their individually delivered performances in active participation with the creation of Keaton's persona, the entire film brimming with a communal vitality. In establishing a film centered on, around, and within one character, Inarritu has created his own subjective world in Birdman, one that mirrors the celebrity driven popular culture of our own, each one of us supporting actors and walk-on's in the theatre of celebrity and fame, all of us culpable in the ignorance of Riggan Thomas.\n\nIn this way, Inarritu's film is about solipsism, with its closest precursor in terms of thematic scope and directorial vision being Charlie Kaufman's 2008 directorial debut Synecdoche, New York, wherein the subjective reality of the New York actor and playwright is examined with the fierceness of an unforgiving and distinctively authorial force, at times remarkable in its overstated ambition and pretentious precocity. And yet, Birdman is never overly heady, as Kaufman's film is, never treading too far into the subjective lens so as to become impenetrable, self-avowedly brilliant but visually opaque. Where Kaufman seems to be too overly in love with his own brilliance, his protagonist suitably left in a literal apocalypse of his own creation by film's end, Inarritu's Riggan is relatively warm, capable of emoting and connecting with those around him, even if they are all forced to co-inhabit his own subjective dreams and nightmares. Where Kaufman's New York Theatre is filled with shadows of narrative misdirection and evasion, coupled with the indecipherable, Joycean mutterings of the literary intelligentsia, Inarritu's is inhabited with the light of the artist still struggling to connect with his audience, embittered towards the academic establishments of theatre and film criticism, and eager to engage with Carver's comparatively accessible text. Birdman is a worthy successor to Kaufman's film, more immediate and emotionally compelling than Synecdoche's grand opera, delivering the equivalent of a three and a half minute pop song to Kaufman's twenty-two minute progressive rock noodling, Synecdoche, Lite in essence.\n\nDespite the near insurmountable ambition and hubris of the film's concept and subject matter, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman lives up to the self-conscious precocity of its subtitle, examining the socio-cultural status of the Hollywood celebrity through the eyes of a falling star. Michael Keaton makes a stunning comeback performance as Riggan Thomas that ranks as one of the best performances of the year, in addition to an already enviable body of work from the past. The level of meta-fictional, self-reference that Keaton is able to pull upon to lend some empathetic tragedy and intimacy to the iconographic nature of a former Hollywood superhero is effectively comical and heartbreaking, Riggan's professional and personal association with the Birdman character as inseparable from his sense of self-identity as Batman is to Keaton in the public eye, lending the film much of its satirical bite and cultural relevance. And yet, for all of its carefully composed strategic plotting that might feel a little too smart for its own good in anyone else's hands, Inarritu never falls prey to cinematic convenience or contrivance, his story of artistic redemption moving and dramatically satisfying, hopeful despite the melancholy of its character's solipsistic ambition. When Riggan finally soars free at the end of the film, both in terms of creative fulfillment and surrealistically projected fantasy, the final note is hopeful, even though the viewer knows that the character still resides within his own head, ignorance his and our creative bliss, made necessary once more by the film's titular and unexpected virtue.",

I like how Whiplash, my favorite film of 2014, was nominated for Best Picture, and it's good to see Dick Poop get the attention he deserves as a cinematographer (yes, I'm actually going to start with a joke about that flub). One movie that didn't surprise anybody was Birdman, which was nominated for many awards. I have seen this movie today, so now I am going to review it.\n\nThe film centers around Michael Keaton's character, who played the lead role in a superhero movie franchise twenty years ago, and now is a washed up actor who hasn't been in much lately (sound familiar). In an attempt to kickstart his career again, he writes, and stars in a Broadway play. The movie is about his struggles with his lack of confidence, as he tries to make this play.\n\nThis movie is advertised as a dark comedy, but it doesn't really have as many humorous scenes as you may think. It is also artsier than the average dark comedy, with most of the movie being done in one long take, and with frequent sequences that seem to be in his imagination.\n\nThe film's casting is clever. In addition to casting Michael Keaton in a role that could almost be considered autobiographical, there are also actors who were in other superhero movies, such as Edward Norton (The Incredible Hulk) and Emma Stone (The Amazing Spider-man).\n\nThe film itself is a pretty good one. It has an interesting story, and is very well directed. It's different from most movies, and I like that. It is not so much a comedy as a satire of the entertainment industry with occasional bursts of humor. It discusses the struggle of has-been actors, as well as how actors are treated according to others' expectations for them.\n\nBirdman is an intriguing, unique movie, that is sure to win a few awards.\n\nJaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",

All of that, expertly moulded into one film that is part All About Eve, part Batman and part Noises Off and part Sunset Boulevard. It's also a strong look at mental illness and the pressures of success in the modern world. \nMichael Keaton is amazing. Almost forgotten in Hollywood, Keaton's most recent outing was the very forgettable Robocop remake, for which he was a very underwhelming villain. Here, he clearly knows the material is top notch. \nBut the supporting cast is also excellent, with not a single poor performance or weak link. Edward Norton (playing a satirical version of himself) is brilliant as he switches from amazing stage actor, to egotistical and destructive before suddenly becoming rational and logical. \nZach Galifanakis is a revelation in his role, so much more subdued and layered than his usual comedic buffoon. And Emma stone continues her climb in Hollywood with another great performance.\nThe film, not seeming a big budget film, takes place mostly in one location, inside a theatre. This gives the film feeling of being a stage play (much like old Hollywood films that were based on plays such as The Petrified Forest or Wait Until Dark) that the limited sets give away the story's theatre roots. However, the film suddenly explodes into a Hollywood comic book movie, with very impressive visual effects. Birdman 4 looks like it would be a great film to go and see.",

            "content": "Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Birdman made a large buzz on the Film Festival circuit before (finally) securing a wider release. Getting a lot of word of mouth, not only for the quality film making and interesting continuous sequence look, but also because of star Michael Keaton. Keaton, probably still best known for his turn as Batman in Tim Burton's 1989 landmark film does a fantastic job playing an aging actor, past his prime and out of his depth in Birdman.\n\nRiggan (Michael Keaton), a once prominent action star is trying his hand at being the lead actor in a play he wrote the adaptation of and is also directing. The play is a project to show the world, and more importantly himself, that Riggan isn't a relic of the past who can only act in a rubber suit. To paraphrase Riggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), that he matters. Riggan's agent and best friend, Jake (Zach Galifianakis), is stressed with trying to balance actor's egos, an ever changing cast, and other stresses that go along with opening a major Broadway production. Mike (Edward Norton) a true performer, lover of the stage, and arrogant actor is brought in last minute to replace a cast member that dropped out. Mike's love of the craft could make or break Riggan's play. Lesley (Naomi Watts) and Laura (Andrea Riseborough) round out the rest of both the play's cast and the movie's cast.\n\nAlejandro Gonzalez Inarritu may not be a household name for many casual movie goers but a quick search on IMDB will undoubtedly ring a few bells for any movie fan. He directed movies like 21 Grams and Bable, just to give you an idea. Trying something that isn't often attempted, Inarritu shot all of Birdman in what appears to be one long sequence, a single take. This technique was most famously done by Alfred Hitchcock in the fantastic movie Rope. More impressively in Hitchcock's time was the limitation of a reel of film, being only so long forced Hitchcock to make cuts and hide them to keep up the look of a single take. Inarritu had technology on his side and used a few techniques, like time lapses, to keep the continuous sequence. In addition to the continuous sequence, the shots and framing are outstanding. The camera feels alive. The angles are creative and follow the action like audiences bobbing their heads back and forth at Wimbledon. The only time the camera is at rest is when the days are transitioning during very well executed time lapses.\n\nMichael Keaton is famous for playing an iconic super hero thirty years prior, he is also an aging actor. The similarities to Riggan stop there. Keaton is a steadily working actor who had a career before he donned a rubber suit and worked steadily his whole life after. Keaton is a fantastic actor who does Drama as well as he does comedy and can now add crazy to his resume. Riggan's is clearly unhinged. Talking to his alter-ego of Birdman throughout most of the film it is clear. Edward Norton is pure Broadway, New York City, 'starving' artist. Starving isn't literal since it is established that his character, Mike, is successful and wide regarded, but Norton plays the stereotype perfectly. Arrogant yet insecure off stage, when it is time for Mike to act he is unmatched. Riggan deals with the craziness of the actor to escalate his play. Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, and Andrea Riseborough are also all amazing performers. There really isn't a weak actor in the entire movie, but a special mention should be made for Zach Galifianakis. Galifianakis is most famously known for his role in the very successful Hangover franchise. Playing an awkward idiotic man-child Galifianakis is incredibly funny. In Birdman he sheds the comedy (and more than a few pounds) to become a full fledged actor. While not an actor within the movie Galifianakis does a fantastic job playing the straight man alongside so much insanity.\n\nSadly, Birdman is guilty of going a bit too far on some things and stepping over a few thin lines that separate brilliant from absurd. The film has Riggan imagining himself with psychic powers, the ability to fly, and being truly more than a simple man. These instances are completely unneccesary. It is clear that Riggan is teetering on the edge because of Keaton's amazing performance. The inner voice was all that was needed to drive the message home. The added science fiction of it all makes it seem like the director didn't have enough faith in his actor to get the job done. There is one larger than life sequence that is supposed to be the turning point for Riggan. The entire scene amounts to nothing, and even makes Riggan's next big move seem out of character. This scene seems to have been shot entirely for the benefit of the trailers. There is also some imbalances in the characters. So much time is spent with Mike and his own version of mental illness that when the character disappears from the movie it feels like a loose end that will never be tied up. Mike isn't dismissed in the form of an open ending or ambiguous results, he is dropped outright.\n\nWith only a few faults to speak of, Birdman is an incredibly directed, acted, and written drama. The continuous sequence look is a technical achievement as well as a totally engrossing way to keep audiences latched to the screen. We are so trained to look for breaks when one doesn't come we practically forget to blink. Michael Keaton is mesmerizing, Edward Norton is commanding.",

His career suffering since he turned down a forth film. Thompson seeks to recapture his fame by making it as a theater actor.  Throughout the film he has to deal with his co-star, his rebellious daughter, and Birdman himself, who symbolizes his self-doubt. Only real criticisms being I felt the critic played by Lindsey Duncan was a little too strong. Though I agree everyone has their personal tastes when it comes to acting, to wanna kill a play simply because the lead actor is known for playing a superhero seems rather unprofessional. Also the I felt the scenes between Stone and Norton seemed unnecessary. But overall, these are minor criticisms.\n Admittedly  the theme of the film is a bit difficult for me. One possible theme is life imitates art shown in such scenes when Keaton's character seems to gain super powers. Though it seems to be more of a symbol of his character going mad. Another theme is just wanting to be loved. This is supported by the fact the films lead wishes to regain his former popularity, and repair his relationship with his daughter. Hence the play What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\n Birdman draws you in with it's visual style. As the film is shot, for the most part, to look like it's all one take. This was done to give the film the feel of watching a theater play. It's a very unique style that draws people in and immerses them  in the films story. \n In conclusion, Birdman is a very odd, but unique film, with a deep story, and fantastic performances. The only real disappointment I can think of, is for people expecting a superhero film about Birdman.",

But under Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's (\"Amores Perros\", \"21 Grams\") capable hands, it is also an experimental film that many other directors have tried before in one form or another. It is made to look like it was filmed in one long unbroken shot from beginning to end with continuous scenes. It is technically impressive with its ensemble acting, writing and cinematography as the standouts. It is also the type of film that may polarize audiences. Those who have seen other experimentally influenced films from Stanley Kubrick, Lars von Trier or Pedro Almodovar know what I'm talking about. But while I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's approach to the material he also co-wrote is very unconventional, it is far from being inaccessible.\n\nSet against the backdrop of actors trying to launch a new Broadway play, the film deals with so many themes including, but not limited to, the ephemeral nature of success, the question of relevance, confusing love for admiration, the quest for what is truly art vs. pop culture and the longing for instant gratification where the definition of achievement is measured in terms of having countless \"likes\" or \"followers\" instead of a lifetime or body of work - universal themes for all of us.\n\nScenes around New York City and its theater world play secondary characters here. The film was shot near Times Square at the St. James Theater where I saw \"The Producers\" with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.\n\n\"Birdman\" is multi-layered, open ended and allows for more than just one interpretation.

Arthouse is often a dry bleak affair, all interpersonal drama and poignant character study with no meat and often no soul. This goes triple for November oscar-bait movies. But Birdman, if you would pardon a bad pun, is a bird of a different feather. It hits on all levels. Director Inarritu creating a modern day fable about a washed out hollywood actor trying to reinvent himself with a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver. MIchael Keaton's character, Riggan used to be big, then he became 'too big' when he played superhero birdman in three blockbusters. Many years later he is washed out, a shadow of his former self and is desperately trying to prove to himself and others that he is a true actor once more. When he comes face to face with new co-star Mike, a 'true' Broadway method actor Riggan's life, play and sanity slowly start unravelling.\n\nLet's start with the cinematography. Inarritu is a great director but the real merit in Birdman's spectacular, unbelievable pacing and its construction as a 'single shot' movie (yes, the whole movie is one -two maybe?- 'faked' tracking shot.) go to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who was also responsible for Tree of Life and almost all of Cuaron's movies: Gravity (a movie I hated but whose technical merits stand firm), Y tu Mama Tambien (a movie i loved), Children of Men (remember _that_ tracking shot?) and many many more. Even if we disregard the faux one-shot style this movie looks stunning, with the framing, the often dream-like lighting and some incredibly framed transitions standing as testament to just how important a good DP is to a movie.\n\nThe score is stunning, a collage of freeform drumbeats that manage to 'break the fourth wall' in regards to whether or not they are diegetic or not and keep the pacing up, driving the story along at times. It is simply unbelivable how simple but at the same time powerful Birdman's score can be. God bless Antonio Sanchez and fuck the Academy for its bullshit rules.\n\nFinally, the acting is simply fantastic with not one single performance dragging the movie down. Michael Keaton puts a nuanced and at the same time batshit crazy performance in and is contrasted extremely well with the incredibly natural Ed Norton. Emma Stone, of Amazing Spiderman infamy plays seamlessly off those two, a telling example of how a good acting environment can push others to greatness. Speaking of which - Zach Galafinakis. God damn, he might not be the greatest actor out there but he really does give his best in this one. Also Billed: Naomi Watts who i've never liked but puts on a good if slightly exagerrated performance and Andrea Riseborough who i only know from the dreadfully forgettable Oblivion but who I'm sure i'll be seeing more of.\n\nBirdman is a modern classic and an unforgettable film. It is certainly a movie i'll be watching again, a meaty, juicy film about theatre, stardom, depression and oblivion that everybody should see.",

At first that is what it seems it is going to focus on but it does touch on more deeper meanings involving his family and his relationships with himself and those around him. Michael Keaton was definitely the best part of the film, he portrayed Riggan so well that i began to believe that this could have actually been a real person. He showed so much passion in playing this character that you really get sucked in to his amazing performance. The supporting cast i felt also did a pretty good job but did not shine as brightly as Keaton. Another highlight from the film has to be the ingenious and mesmerising method used to film it. The one-shot sweeping camera technique used gave this film a very different feel than many other films and really let you follow these characters and get to see them in all different environments without all of the jarring cuts. The performances as well as shooting technique are what make this film what it is. But that was still not enough for me to absolutely love this movie, the overall tone of the film didn't really work for me, i understood why they went for a dark and comedic yet also dramatic tone as there were some sections that i really enjoyed but for the most part i couldn't really enjoy the entire film as much as i wanted to. Despite not being able to really enjoy this film as much as i had hoped, i still got to see one of the performances of the year in one of the more different films of 2014, if you are an admirer of some different, quality film this may be the film for you - 7.6",

Was he really a Broadway actor? Nothing is a given. This unpredictability makes the movie stand out from cookie cutter movie story lines. \n\nMicheal Keaton, the first real movie Batman, sorry Adam West, is the perfect actor to portray a man typecast in one particular role. No matter what Keaton does, the majority of the population over 30, who were alive to see his movies, will still see him as Batman. \n\nBut now the younger generation of millenials have a different reference. They think of Batman as Christian Bale and soon maybe Ben Afflec, depending on how good he is. If he's like George Clooney or Roger Moore as Bond, he may just be a fleeting impersonator. The New Coke of a Hollywood Icon.\n\nWhen teens like this movie and decide to go back and watch Batman or Batman Returns they'll say, \"Birdman was a pretty good Batman.\"\n\nBirdman humanizes a bigger than life character and the actor behind the mask.

I have no fucking clue who or what is birdman and how his super natural powers work? I mean throughout the whole film he just throws shit and moves shit whenever he wants. My point is this does not get resolved at all, I mean how did he become birdman? For people who haven't seen the comics its very hard to understand what the fuck is going on. Especially at the end when he shoots his nose off and then fly's out the window. What the actual fuck is this movie about? Is it about how he wants to make it as a big actor and then realizes he can fucking fly? In all honesty the dude getting a hard on was by far the best part.",

It seems to have everything from never-ending shots (obviously not truly so), ridiculously good acting-within-acting performances, a story of loss and failure, but then it's also a bit weird. Critics don't mind weird, obviously; they've seen that before. But have they really? Birdman is unusual, eerie, even painful to the ear sometimes. Maybe that's the point. It's as if somebody has gone out of their way to tell us that acting is not paradise. I believe them. I believe in Birdman.",

Yes, it's technically creative - in particular, the way it uses very long takes to move through the theatre to tell its story. But the attempts to be innovative and creative overshadow any substance the story might have had - and there isn't much of substance. It does explore the desperate need for love and identift - but there is nothing new here and it is mostly pretty boring except for a few moments of intensity. I'm not sure why many are raving over Michael Keaton's performance - I suppose it is a bit more in-depth to what he usually does. The feeling is that the director is trying really hard to impress us - but he has tried too hard and made the film overly self-conscious. As I was watching it, I was thinking about the movie - but mostly felt nothing. It's all pretty pretentious stuff.",

On a purely technical level, it's astounding. Precisely edited to appear as though the whole thing were executed in one extremely long take, it's a mesmerizing experience, profoundly different and expertly crafty when the timeline needs to leap forward. It's dazzlingly acted, too, with Keaton delivering a masterful performance alongside noteworthy supporting work from Ed Norton, Emma Stone and (to my surprise) a very versatile Zach Galifianakis. The moral lessons are laid on thick, though, and too often it feels like we're being lectured for daring to indulge in the kind of loathsome fun that drove our lead to this strange brand of mania. One scene in particular, Keaton's confrontation with a stuffy critic before opening night (who glares right into the camera before storming off in a cloud of self-righteousness) plays like a direct scolding of the audience. Maybe theatre purists will take this as a firm voice of reason, the rare call of someone who finally *gets* it, but to me it came off as tremendously stuck-up and pretentious. I can't deny there's a lot to enjoy here, and it's a clear arrival for auteur Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, but I also can't help wondering how much better it would be without that permeating air of superiority.",

There is wit and at times we laugh out loud. And the way it is shot means we are often backstage and part of the ensemble that is struggling to launch the show on Broadway. \nThe trouble for me is, even allowing for the fact that actors can be wrapped up in their own melodramas to a greater extent than those they are employed to portray, this sad and sorry collection of individuals eventually brought me down to their level - one of unmitigated gloom and despondency. The result was, feeling they were architects of their own fates, I ran out of patience with their stupidity and no longer cared what happened to them.\nExcellent though he is in the lead, as the one-time superhero attempting to resurrect a career otherwise heading towards the toilet pan, Keaton's character (who can only speak the lines given to him) seems to suffer from a death wish that would thwart even the archangel Gabriel. In fact the whole cast in this play within a play (with the possible exception of Emma Stone as Keaton's daughter - who almost steals the whole show in my view) seem so consumed by their own misery they tend to forget they are on the verge of launching a play that has the potential to actually succeed.  But success does not seem to be what this is all about. Even when handed the golden key to Broadway, Keaton prefers to sabotage the project by veering off on a tangent of his own making. I was with them for a good three-quarters of the journey, but felt by the end they were best left alone to drown in their respective sorrows.\nI can see why so many viewers of this film are on their feet and applauding, but for me, proficient though it undoubtedly is,it contains an element of the king without his clothes on. Consequently I found its particular version of nudity somewhat tiresome. It might be cleverer than I am giving it credit for, but, you know what?

From the incredibly detailed direction from Inarritu to the pitch perfect acting from the entire ensemble (Keaton gives an award worthy performance). Birdman was the film in 2014 I have been waiting for. Alejandro Inarritu has constructed a feast for the eyes as the majority of Birdman's two hour run time is shot and edited in such a careful way that the film looks like one long scene. My eyes were glued to the screen as I marveled at the technical wizardry i was witnessing. Add the score by Antonio Sanchez which is mainly a drum set playing elaborate solos and fills creating an unpredictability in the film. The screenplay is top notch as this drama/comedy likes to pick fun at how blockbusters have taken over Hollywood and the struggle for a small/independent project to get made. The dialogue scenes between characters are by far the best constructed I've seen all year. The ensemble as i said earlier is perfect. Everyone brought their A-game. Even Zack Galifianakis surprised me playing a reserved role instead of a loud, fumbling idiot. But it truly is Michael Keaton who is the brightest of the star. The inner battle with Riggan propels the movie from one character to the next. Keaton's performance is definitely worth an Oscar Nomination (and he will probably win). This is on the Academy's radar for best picture of the year and it should be because in my eyes it is the best film I have seen all year!

She is just one of the many clich\u00e9s and stereotypes which litter this movie: the overpaid, narcissistic actor/director-on-the-edge; the over-burdened, neurotic manager; the brattish, rebellious daughter; the insecure, needy actresses and of course, the genius-but-impossible-to-work-with, method actor. \nEven the clever in-jokes are over-played, like the casting of two actors embittered by their stints as superheroes to satirically act out their real-life reputations, Keaton famous for playing on-the-edge characters (Beetlejuice, Batman and Dream Team), Norton famous for being notoriously difficult to work with. I found it hard to stomach these actors, both of whom made super-rich by their trade, ironically riffing on the amount earned by RDJ for Iron Man, even as art imitating life, imitating art. We get it! Don't labour the point to absurdity. Hollywood is solely about the money and imaginatively bankrupt. We get it! \nI am being a bit unfair, the casting and acting does redeem this film, as does the amazing cinematography, but as demonstrated by other actor-indulgent-films, like American Hustle last year, allowing actors to improvise does not necessarily make for realistic, gritty dialogue. It comes across as stilted, unfocused and self indulgent, just like this movie. It won one well deserved Oscar for Best Cinematography. Best Director, okay I can appreciate Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's vision and his talent at getting such performances from such notoriously difficult actors. Best Film? I don't think so, though not really surprising when looking at the narcissism of the voters, \"Ooh look, a film all about me\". That said, I am deeply appalled that such a hackneyed story, full of clich\u00e9d characters spouting unrealistic dialogue, could win Best Original Screenplay when compared to the other nominees.

            "content": "Once in awhile those few gems will come around and remind you of why you watch films in the first place, while I still think Boyhood is the best of 2014, Birdman joins a pretty awesome list of those films of 2014. Birdman is a truly excellent film that does so many unique things and actually has something to say. \n\nI'd like to think that in my reviews that I come across as someone that doesn't just try to say snarky comments just to have something to quote on a DVD case. I love film and review films from a personal and passionate standpoint, not just to look at the technicals and tear into people. However, it feels like a joke to even try review Birdman because one of its many themes that it addresses is critics, which has an excellent scene and that rant where Riggan just tears into that critic is a fantastic scene and hopefully one that got a few people thinking. Michael Keaton really felt like he pulled from his own life experiences for this film but especially for that scene in particular and I wonder how much of it was ad-libbed. \n\nThe pseudo-biopic angle that this film has going is quite surreal, I wonder if when the actors read the script they just thought of something strange or a remark to say to the filmmakers. All of the characters in this film seem to be played up to be exaggerated versions of the actors, Keaton more than most, obviously; and strangely enough it works really well, even if some aren't used that much near the end, unfortunately. Keaton said that Riggan is unlike himself and that works even more in the films favor for the exaggeration and they have the same amount of letters! He also said it was the most challenging film he has ever done but that hard work really paid off! I'd hate to use the term 'washed up' because, especially in Keaton's case, I don't believe it because he's been consistently working for many years now and I just don't like that term anyway. \n\nThe acting in this film is outstanding and everybody does an excellent job, the script is brilliant and they all work fantastically with each other, through excellent dialogue and well developed relationships. The way the script references things that have happened in 'the real world' does give it that extra touch of realism. This film seems to have shielded itself from criticism in a way, clearly not because it doesn't have 100%, but if anyone has a complaint about it, people, or at least people I know, would have a little laugh and a joke about them bringing up a complaint. However, there was one scene, just one, where the acting felt really fake. One character was yelling at another character about something and whilst their body language and face were acting out that moment, their eyes didn't seem like they were in the moment and it just felt really manufactured, it reminded me I was watching a film. I know that's a real nitpick if there ever was one but hey.\n\nSeeing as how I haven't really spoken about structure yet and just used big words to label everything, why don't we talk about the story? The way everything is put together in this film is some of the best filmmaking I've ever seen, it looks like one shot but it isn't and there are points when it looks like you can tell where it's been cut but having everything look like one long take certainly gives the film a new kind of life. While I haven't seen a film that was actually one take, like Russian Ark, at the time of writing this, this style really puts you into the story. I felt totally engrossed in this film and I felt like I was there with them, this totally gives new meaning to the term, 'experience', it's smartly assembled and the transitions are flawless. At first, when I saw a few little clips of the film, everything looked to be close ups of the characters and I'm glad the whole film wasn't filmed like that because that would have gotten annoying really quickly. I love why the director chose to have it all be one take, because life is all one take and doesn't have cuts, that's awesome. The soundtrack is much like the film, it is unpredictable and feels improvised, especially in scenes involving the unique, stylised text, to fit the moment that it's playing with, which is brilliant.\n\nBesides everything else that already makes it unique, a lot of what happens in the story are things that I don't think I have ever seen before. It's just so refreshing to watch something that really has something to say about pretty much everything, this film tackles so many interesting subjects from interesting angles from its excellently written characters and it really gives the audience a lot to think about, not just critics. It's an emotional film and it is totally unforgettable. But hey, it should have been Birdman 2 where Riggan stooped, not 3 but that's pretty clever why it was 3 and 1992 was the right year, odd that, isn't it...\n\nBirdman, and it's very Dr. Strangelove-like name, or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a perfect film and something that was made for the right reasons that really has something to say and it was all filmed in under a month, terrific. With brilliant effort from everyone involved, Birdman is, just simply, a masterpiece and one of the best films I've ever seen.",

            "content": "En este filme que uno de sus factores es la carga de haber encarnado a un super-h\u00e9roe hace muchos a\u00f1os, no es raro encontrar liderando al elenco al brillante Michael Keaton quien dio vida a Batman en el fen\u00f3meno cultural mundial que fue el filme de 1989 y repitiendo el rol en 1992. Pero es tambi\u00e9n curioso encontrar a Edward Norton, quien fue el Dr. Bruce Banner en \"The Incredible Hulk\", segundo filme del Phase 1 del Universo Cinem\u00e1tico de Marvel, y para rematar tenemos a Emma Stone, quien encarn\u00f3 a Gwen Stacy en las primeras dos entregas de la actual saga de \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Pero no se equivoquen, quien vaya al cine a ver este filme porque busca ver otro filme m\u00e1s de super-h\u00e9roes que ahora es algo regular, se dar\u00e1n una gran sorpresa ya que fuera de mencionar de una forma muy casual que el personaje principal (Keaton) encarn\u00f3 a un h\u00e9roe en el cine llamado \"Birdman\" (sin ninguna relaci\u00f3n salvo el nombre con el personaje de Hanna-Barbera, aunque bien puede ser una amalgama de ese Birdman y Blue Falcon), hasta ah\u00ed llega el v\u00ednculo con el glamoroso universo de los h\u00e9roes uniformados. Incluso me extra\u00f1a que los Globos de Oro la hayan metido en la categor\u00eda de comedia, ya que salvo un momento irremediablemente divertido, la pel\u00edcula es eminentemente un drama. Una de los principales detalles de esta cinta es haber sido filmada \"en una sola toma\" o la ilusi\u00f3n de haber sido as\u00ed ya que fue realmente un impecable trabajo de edici\u00f3n para que parezca as\u00ed, aunque no es algo nunca antes visto, ya que el filme de horror \"La Casa Muda\" hecha en Uruguay en el 2010, us\u00f3 esta misma idea, solo que manteniendo adem\u00e1s el factor de tiempo real, o sea los eventos duran lo que dura la cinta, lo cual no es as\u00ed aqu\u00ed en \"Birdman\" donde el gran trabajo de edici\u00f3n y fotograf\u00eda crea una ilusi\u00f3n efectiva donde la trama tiene evidentes saltos temporales pero no as\u00ed en la \"toma\" que se v\u00e9 en pantalla. En cuanto a la atm\u00f3sfera de la cinta, podr\u00eda considerarla como una mezcla entre \"Black Swan\" y el esquema t\u00edpico de un filme de Woody Allen, que tal vez por esa similitud a una cinta de Allen es que la consideraron una comedia, pero honestamente no creo que eso sea acertado. El director, Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Amores Perros, Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful) maneja un impresionante elenco de actores sac\u00e1ndoles actuaciones muy buenas, pero creo que lo criticable ser\u00eda el gui\u00f3n, el cual es un script que permite sacar a luz aspectos internos de las personalidades de los actores, principalmente Edward Norton, ya que si bien Michael Keaton hizo a \"Batman\", dudo mucho que en la realidad se sienta con ese personaje, como lo hace en el filme con respecto a \"Birdman\" (de hecho el ha comentado que este personaje es el m\u00e1s diferente a como es \u00e9l en la vida real que ha actuado), pero creo que el gui\u00f3n pudo ser m\u00e1s crudo, m\u00e1s personal, m\u00e1s revelador, y adem\u00e1s la trama no tiene un norte claro ni un prop\u00f3sito evidente salvo visitar a esta gama de personajes en su interacci\u00f3n durante unos cuantos d\u00edas de sus vidas cuando una obra de teatro est\u00e1 por estrenarse. El factor surreal de la historia es brillante pero igualmente, al carecer de un objetivo claro la historia en general, como un todo, salvo obviamente el deseo de la mayor\u00eda de la gente de dejar una huella en este mundo, de ser recordados, pero sobre todo de ser recordados por lo que nosotros queremos y no por lo que la gente decida, sin embargo, creo que el filme queda debiendo un poco en establecer una coherencia estructural completa en su gui\u00f3n, que es brillante s\u00ed, pero dif\u00edcil de asimilar como un todo. Pero eso no significa que no sea algo interesante de observar y d\u00f3nde su final (tranquilos no voy a hacer spoilers) es simplemente genial e inapreciable, algo breve pero monumental y abierto a ser debatido por a\u00f1os.",

You're running along with this film chasing it's characters and eventually stepping into their shoes. The Director blurs the line on how close you can get as an audience member. Celebrating performance and also berating uninspired social hierarchy, the media, critics, people on the interwebs.  For me, Birdman gets to the painstaking truth lying just beyond ideas we have about being famous, or successful. It takes you seriously into America's fantasizing, and explores deeply the circles of entertainment. You almost expect to have an intermission, because it requires so much focus, but the film takes respite from its constant motion. Like a well-crafted painting, it leaves moments for the audience to \"rest\" upon before coming at you with another detailed edge. Mostly I just wanted to applaud the performers, their production team, and the director. EVERYONE involved really, that's because it's such a gem- designed by what must be an incredible team of inspired individuals. Birdman is the play, within the movie, within real life that we all must desperately want to be a part of. Keen audience members will remark that the space in which all things happen is really the star of the show. Life it seems is CAPTURED with a flash and a picture frame. Performance is drawn, lifelike, out of the \"real\" situations to only to rise and then fall back into the space of the moving picture. Like man known to death, Birdman knows it's own convictions and place in existence. It's aware that it's a \"Movie\" and seems to want to crash down those walls securely hanging it there. Mostly just incredible through and through, it's a must watch for the season, and for the year. Delivering the kind of mind-bending experience needed the kids these days all tuned in, and never letting you breathe until it's over. So go, and witness all the magic and depth that modern story telling can provide. Draft Two (to be edited and revised)",

Michael Keaton shows us once again why it's a crime he has never been nominated for an Oscar, and why his first nomination could be his first win. Edward Norton once again shows us his prowess and versatility as an actor playing an actor with serious problems that lead him to clash with Keaton and make us think he could also have his first win here, with possibly his strongest performance of a long and brilliant career. Galifianakis, and stone both exceed expectations with career high performances. Put all this together and what you get is the disturbing, funny, and brilliant movie that bird man is, and if it's success in the award season doesn't convince you than watch it yourself and you'll wonder how you ever doubted this movies potential.

The social \"mask\" that he has put on is one of a successful play director and actor, but beneath the fa\u00e7ade he has created, he longs for spiritual liberation and to become his true and authentic self. He used to play the superhero Birdman on Broadway, and he felt more at ease and himself when in that role. The whole movie is a metaphor for his cathartic struggle to break free of a life he is miserable in, and the voice in his head that torments him is his id trying to break free. This movie is brilliantly acted, superbly directed, and tautly scripted. It is poetic in parts and tragically funny in others. Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Edward Norton and the entire supporting cast all display fine acting, which makes the movie both an easy contender for Best Picture and will undoubtedly find some of the actors with nominations as well. The message is the movie is existential, and is embedded within many layers of profound metaphysics and the issue of authenticity that so many existentialists have struggled to solve. The film is intelligent and creative in its approach and is one of the most complex films of 2014. Immensely enjoyable if not tragic -------------------------------------------------------- A",

Without that not-so-subtle real world connection, what lure would this story have?\n\nWhile it is certainly well made and the actors do a good job with what they are given, it left me wondering what I just watched. There is little, if anything, that is really new regarding subject matter. The sets are realistically grungy and New-York filthy. As a technical production, it goes back to the few-cuts approach used by the likes of Hitchcock, and does it well. But why?\n\nUltimately, I see this as an example of film that will be studied by art directors and editors. It is a movie for people who make movies, and they will be the people who love it the most.

This story has been told before in many ways (have seen many films like this before, not new to me and TV shows with a kinda similar taste as that one of 2 seasons...yeah, SMASH). The music score is not the best (remind me of that show I love called FARGO....oh wait, it works for TV...but not for a movie, oh well). The acting of this cast was strange and at the same time inspiring (the story helps with that but...have seen better). Emma Stone & Keaton are the ones who deserve awards from now on (hope they win a Golden or an Oscar, who knows?). Naomi was great also and the rest too. Alejandro como director es muy bueno but even if he tried not to use editing in most part wehn his editor did...I would have cut all of that (for me it was not worth it but if for Ale works, let it be).

Nicely put everything, I waited till the end with more and more curiosity. I got more from this movie than what I was expecting. \n\nIt is one of those movies what you should not go to watch because of Emma Stone, Naomi watts or Edward Norton. But because of the direction, camera work, cinematography and story line up. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez deserves a great clap for his great work. I will watch all of his movies, I can promise that.",

            "content": "'Birdman' is an interesting film, but also a movie about a Broadway play - not the most invigorating subject. The concept of a former Comic Book Movie Star trying to re-start his acting career on Broadway is certainly unique, and the film has a great look - especially the way it's filmed to look almost as if it's one continuous shot. There's a few laughs, but this is definitely not a comedy.\n\nKeaton (Riggan) is great and ably supported by Stone (Sam, his daughter), Norton (Mike - happy to get around in underpants or his birthday suit for most of his scenes) & Watts (Lesley, his co-stars), although Galifianakis is a little wasted. Even though the cinematography is good, the fact it's basically one shot means there's a fair bit of wasted time as we follow characters down hallways. Probably could've been an efficient 100min film, rather than two hours. The other thing I found annoying was the drum/cymbal fills - they're in his mind, but are very distracting.\n\nIt's essentially about ego and the driving force behind actors. Sure, Riggan is a more delusional character than most actors (hopefully!), driven by his insecurity. As the critic says to him: \"you're not an actor - you're a celebrity\". Burn. The ending is, like the whole film, different, but not completely satisfying.",

Michael Keaton plays a washed up action hero who sinks all the cash he has left in his ageing and dwindling existence into staging a Broadway play, hoping it will make him relevant again. This film is shot to look like it flows in one clean shot, the camera flows alongside the actors, capturing everyone's foibles, their struggles with existing in a world where everyone needs to be seen as something great, where if they can't make it in this life they will slink back into the shadows and crumble into sand. Edward Norton and Michael Keaton are quite superb here as the two male leads, the female characters are not written as strongly but Watts does well with what she has as does Stone as the ex addict daughter who just needs to be loved by her father. It's a great film and Keaton deserves the Oscar talk. Good to see Galifianakis with a serious role, can show he has the acting chops instead of mugging it for laughs.",

Anyways, Birdman is one of the best American movies ever, also one of the best Stage play dramas ever to put on film since Synecdoche, New York last 2007 or 2008 which some critics claimed it to be the best of the 2000s. Inarritu's direction is one that should definitely get an Oscar nomination, look at how he (Inarritu) shot face to face and set to set and area to area, it's truly one of a kind. The performances, I keep saying this over and over again, but here it's no excuse, Keaton should deserve his long awaited best Actor nomination and so does Norton too who I think his best Best movie performance to date since 1998's American History X. Emma Stone and all the other female supporting characters here should get some praised for some of their important and meaningful roles that as we see it, not portrayed as some street hookers or f****d up women. Did I also forgot Zach Galifaniakis here? Is also his fine role here than what we used to see him in some stupid comedic roles, thoroughly a breakthrough performance. The more that I think and go deeper on how Birdman was shot and filmed, I thought of how you can create a piece of art without copying or plagiarizing other people's work, so you see it here, Inarritu's direction is a work or art, from as I said it earlier, the score, the introduction of Keaton and the other characters, the stage with and without the audiences, the stress on and off the stage, the father and daughter arguments, Keaton and Norton arguments, Keaton and his women, the people outside the theater, the New York in day and night, and to the last scene which I can say is more of a resolution to the Birdman. I also found out on the news that they are making a sequel to Birdman and it's gonna be about believe it or not, the prequel to King Kong. \nOther than that, great stuff, we wish we're gonna see more films like this.",

Pulling of\nthis feat, will have numerous barriers, including a co-star lover, a narcissistic, unpredictable co-star (played Ed\nNorton), that seems to be trying to sabotage the production at every\nturn, if it means staying true to himself, and most importantly, his own self doubt and terror that he is a fraud.\n\nIs Birdman light on plot?

This becomes somewhat tedious during the first, longest 54 minute continuous shot but Birdman begins to soar in the second hour when the more fantastical elements of the story come to the forefront (involving Michael Keaton's 'split personality' as an actor/celebrity and his superhero alter ego, Bridman). This filming technique and the Broadway setting leads to some 'theatrical acting' (especially from the three biggest stars, Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, and especially Emma Stone). This unbalances the performances a little against the whole ensemble (Edward Norton, Lindsay Duncan, and a notable Amy Ryan). This doesn't help the (somewhat elitist) intellectual, nazel-gazing at its heart about the difference between acting and ACT-ing (thank you).

Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Andrea Riseborough, all give their very best and the result is a masterpiece.\nIt's Oscar season and, rightfully so, Birdman is one of the films everyone's talking about. From its lead actor's phenomenal performance to the astounding visual effects that make the film feel like its going real-time, director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez's palpable commitment to Antonio Sanchez's almost primitive yet electrifying score, everything adds up so beautifully that you can't help but feel privileged to witness such a dazzling piece of art\nSpeaking of dazzling, well, the cinematography can not get better than this. I salute Emmanuel Lubezki. He is a genius, period! I mean... Children of Men (2006), Tree of Life (2011), Gravity (2013), and now Birdman (2014)... This man has become the undisputed king. Words can't do justice to his work, so i'll leave it to you to witness the art and judge for yourself.\nAll in all, a perfect 10/10 score from my side. And, well, the film deserves loads of Oscars, especially in the lead actor and cinematography categories.\nStill reading? Go watch it already! =)",

The film is a triumph. I don't care for any of the praises the world is singing, such as the way it looks like one singular shot. Those things don't matter to me. The story is all that matters, and this has a great one. A very meta one too.\n\nBirdman follows Riggan Thompson, portrayed by Michael Keaton, an actor known for playing a superhero. He's clearly past his glory days, and now, wants another shot at glory, in a completely different medium. Everyone, from critics to his family, laugh and ridicule him for his upcoming project. He writes, directs and starrs in his own play, on Broadway.\n\nIt's a story of redemption. Riggan falls into the trap of trying to please everybody. Ever hear the quote 'I can't tell you how to succeed... but I can tell you how to fail, by trying to please everyone.' That's Riggan. Michael Keaton is magnetic, desperate and angry. He plays an actor so well, his problems, his superficial problems are relevant and funny. Like most actors in our generation. He desires another shot to escape mediocrity. Something he clearly lives in, and is reminded of everyday.\n\nSupporting Keaton, is an all-star cast comprising of Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts. Who all carry and distribute the load well, they have their own issues. These characters could have their own story, their own film, they meld in this seamlessly. These actors and actresses know what they are doing, they know when to be loud, and they know when to be quiet and blend in the background as to not takeover the story. Brilliant effort by the supporting cast.\n\nThe most memorable scene of the film occurs when Riggan argues with a renowned critic. Who wins that scene? Still wondering.\n\nMichael Keaton, delivers a career best performance, and is all but standing on the Oscar stage. While I do think there were better performances in the year of 2014, specifically Jake Gylenhaal and Benedict Cumberbatch in 'NightCrawler' and 'The Imitation Game'. This performance seems like one the Academy would enjoy and give the nod too, and rightfully so.",

            "content": "One thing that this film proves is that even at the age of sixty three, Michael Keaton can rule! This time he is poking fun at the his own career choice of playing a superhero with the fact that he has played Batman (Batman & Batman Returns) in the past makes his appearance all the more hilarious & ironic. The story follows Riggan (Michael Keaton), a washed up actor who used to play a superhero icon called Birdman. In a valiant attempt to reclaim his career, he adapts, directs, and stars in a Broadway play. With problems from one of his very method actors (Edward Norton), assistant daughter (Emma Stone), emotional co-star (Naomi Watts), overly sexual girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), flamboyant producer (Zach Galifanakis), and loving ex- wife (Amy Ryan), Riggan prepares for the breaking point of his career well of course while dealing with his \"inner voice\" of the alter ego Birdman. This movie left me feeling as though every emotion I've ever experienced and every thought I've ever had were condensed in 2 hours of amazing cinema and then reflected back at me, defying me to stare them in the face, right there, where I sitting & saying wow! Every aspect of the film is masterfully crafted and executed & the brilliant cinematography only exemplifies this. The brilliant choice of always having the camera rolling lets the viewer see what happens before and after any given event. This added information creates a realism unknown to nearly every other movie ever made. What better way to capture the raw emotion and awkward stumbling of an angry outburst at your father than to show the immediate reaction of the ranter following her outburst; you get to see the anger slowly fade from her face as the reality of what she said sets in. Rarely does a film come around that manages to be creative, original, funny, well acted, spectacularly anchored, well written and technically profound. The film has an excellent cast ensemble - Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone, Ed Norton, Amy Ryan, Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough, every single actor gets to shine in their moment of screen time provided & utilize its full potential. Michael Keaton has been criminally underutilized in his career, despite some iconic performances. While the nerd crowd (Like me!) worships him as one of the most ideal Bruce Wayne/Batman combo, his career hasn't been stellar and it's a surprise I even knew his name before I saw this film! But his performance in this film deserves all the attention he gets and all the awards he is being nominated for. Riggan is a complex character and you are never quite sure about him, how he feeling and how he feels towards others, not only because of how Riggan changes as the film goes on but also because of how that reflects the ever-changing nature of the film, moving from one question or theme to the other without actually leaving it behind, instead leaving it in the back of your mind for you to think about later. A scene-stealing standout, Edward Norton makes us realize how unspoken dialogue between characters can be just as humorous without the punchline. is brilliant (playing the self-obsessed, ego-driven actor who feels more real on the stage than off it, Mike Shiner). Emma Stone has finally arrived in 2014!! Criminally misused and passed over by Hollywood for \"bigger name\" actresses, Stone finally shows the world what they've been missing. In one single scene, Stone revolutionizes and captures the essence of a \"father-daughter\" with a ferocity that you couldn't see from any other performer. She finds the heart and soul of Sam, laying her on the screen meticulously and transparent. Zach Galifanakis (playing Riggan's agent, Jake) is probably his most grounded role, is also brilliant. Though brief in screen time, the vivacious Naomi Watts, the sexy Andrea Riseborough, and the seasoned Amy Ryan make their marks exquisitely. Watts gets the most chuckles out of the ladies while Ryan has the greatest arc for us to explore. The only criticism I have about the film is that more aren't like it. A smart, satirical movie that is capable of criticizing without being hypocritical is unfortunately rare. However, it's rather nice to have movies like this stand out from the crowd instead of being the norm, because the relative quality only makes them that much better. On the whole \"Birdman\" is so damn enjoyable and one of the most entertaining films I have seen in years. It charms not just because of its story, but because of the performances and slick way that director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu plays with tone. It's downright hilarious in parts, and then there's the dramatic edge that comes into play, and simply breaks your heart. Above all, \"Birdman\" is a celebration of cinema. It's an audacious achievement that floors just about every aspect of film witnessed in 2014.",

The way they chose to shoot the movie where long stretches look like one continuous scene give the film a unique feel that adds to its mystique.\n\nThis is the beginning of the Keaton Renaissance & there's a great chance he will be in high demand when he takes home that Best Actor Oscar he has all but won. Edward Norton delivers in so many ways & I can see him possibly taking home the Oscar for Supporting Actor. Both Keaton & Norton wouldn't be in that position if they didn't have such great chemistry. The scene where they first meet is phenomenal.\n\nSome people won't like Birdman. I can see why, but damn it's a good movie and will be right there with Boyhood, Selma, The Imitation Game waiting for the final Oscar of the night & hoping it's name is called.",

            "content": "Birdman is undeniably Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's largest project; a masterwork of size, scope and ambition. Its far-reaching impact on the world of cinema shall be felt for many years into the future, its commentary on the criticism and management of the showbiz world real and resonant.\n\nSo why does Birdman feel so god-damned overdone?\n\nFormer cinema superhero Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is mounting an ambitious Broadway production that he hopes will breathe new life into his stagnant career. It's risky, but he hopes that his creative gamble will prove that he's a real artist and not just a washed-up movie star. As opening night approaches, a castmate is injured, forcing Riggan to hire an actor (Edward Norton) who is guaranteed to shake things up. Meanwhile, Riggan must deal with his girlfriend, daughter and ex-wife. Courtesy of Google\n\nEvery single scene in this film is full of bright lights, energetic performances; shouting, screaming, laughing, weeping, thrasing, sweeping. The melodrama is constant. The aggression is admirably palpable; though strangely not as consistent as one would desire. Birdman is, honestly, a bit of a mess. It's a redundant, self-indulgent, highly entertaining mess of a film. It's a film of pretentious standards; one that believes in merits, ideals and concepts that it views, at least from my examinations, as profound or unique. The concepts that it tackles are so overtly blatant that it's completely laughable. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu smashes the idea that corrupted, ungenuine film, stage and entertainment criticism is ruining the business right into our heads, and you can be sure that no audience member, whether they actually give a shit or pay attention to the metaphorical components behind the flashy exterior, will be able to gather a clear understanding of exactly what the director is trying to provoke. Hasn't the man ever heard of the word \"subtlety\"?\n\nPerhaps he's saying that the only way to get through the thick skulls of casual cinema-goers and producers alike is to shout at them; to throttle them and throw them about; to scream right into their ears until they adhere and can fully comprehend what you're saying? Tell them in the loudest voice possible that they're spending money on bullshit franchises, sagas and action films whilst the \"art\", what should be earning recognition and money, is shunned and thrown into the dirt. But by doing this, everything within Birdman becomes so immensely literal; for something that appears to be trying to provoke higher thought or commentary, there really isn't any place higher to look for I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's thoughts on the showbiz world than the surface level of the film. That coupled with the fact that nothing that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is saying is really that original or inventive makes Birdman into a thoroughly disengaging film on the level of metaphorical importance.\n\nAt this point, it sounds as if I'm completely shitting on the film. In all reality though, I really loved a majority of this picture. It's infuriatingly obvious in what it's trying to say, but that doesn't necessarily mean its message is unimportant. It's self-importance doesn't at all have me disregarding the technical weight of this oft-times astounding picture. The cinematography, provided by one of the greats of our generation, Emmanuel Lubezki (responsible for the cinematography for Gravity and The Tree of Life; two of the best looking films of the past decade), is fast-paced and always moving forward. As you've undoubtedly already heard, the film is made to look like it's shot in one take, and it is an amiable effort from all those involved to produce a film which looks as good as this does whilst also contending with the issue of not having time to recoup between smaller takes; every single individual take is long and arduous, and so even minor changes in terms of the lighting equipment and set design would've been irritating, time consuming and major in the scheme of things.\n\nLubezki's cinematography, working alongside the immensely compact set design which emphasizes the limited space provided within Broadway theatres, is intimate, even in the scenes of larger size, and is always frantic and moving. Whereas many directors vie for complete and utter control of their camera movements, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Lubezki allow the frame to roam, traversing high and low, capturing all the variables of the performances provided by the incredible actors and actresses on offer. There really isn't a film which I can actively compare to Birdman on a visceral level, and so despite any gripes that anyone may have with the film on a storytelling level, I find it hard to believe that anyone can fault the efforts of those involved in terms of cinematography, lighting, set design, etc.\n\nAlso deserving of universal acclaim is perhaps the greatest editing I've ever seen in a film, period. To match up the individual takes so goddamn perfectly deserves nothing but praise; Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione are geniuses. I can't even imagine how much tedious work it would have required to have it feel so seamless! And then we move into the performances; to describe the acting in this film, the vast majority of it feels alive. Invigorating, as fast as the speed of the camera, and full of personality; despite my numerous quibbles with the slapstick comedy and dull \"raunchy\" humour that the screenplay contains, those who deliver the lines are oft-times sensational. The lead, Michael Keaton, is nothing short of outstanding. Every single second that he was on screen, my heart was pumping and I felt rejuvenated. It wasn't on the same level as Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game or Bradley Cooper in American Sniper, but Keaton's immensely aggressive, assured performance is worthy of admiration all the same. The rest of the ensemble is either outstanding with their roles or greatly melodramatic (still entertaining at that, though). Edward Norton is fantastic, enacting the self-indulgence that his character displays perfectly, and provides what is undoubtedly the closest thing to a perfect performance from a supporting cast member all throughout. Zach Galifianakis is almost as incredible, his line delivery some of the fastest and most versatile on offer; his humour always hitting. Other performances, including those from Emma Stone and Naomi Watts in particular, feel far more artificial, and despite a quality monologue from the former around halfway through, don't contain as much lively energy as the others around them.\n\nAll that said, no matter how impressive the performances, they can't help but be pulled down into the unavoidable abyss that is I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's constant bombardment of melodrama. Whilst the numerous (by this, I mean a shit-tonne) hostile exchanges between characters are often engaging to begin with, their constant reintroduction and implementation feels immensely forced; not necessarily due to the work of the performers, but because of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's relentless direction and need to make everything as flamboyant and huge as possible. There are only so many times where I can take a verbal sparring match seriously, before it becomes repetitive and redundant, as it does here. Still, there are times when it is entirely applaudable; the first few times Keaton's character Riggan loses his shit, whether it be towards himself or a fellow actor, it's hard not to sit up in your seat and watch with interest and intent.\n\nWhether I sound like I'm contradicting myself when I say this or not, I don't care; I did enjoy Birdman. I enjoyed its technical achievements, the performances, the intensity and frenzied pace of the entire thing. It was a heap of fun! All the same, I can't help but feel like I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is being immensely self-indulgent all throughout; I can almost hear him screaming at the Academy to award him with as many top honours as possible. His desire to provoke something more, something we haven't seen, seems only detrimental to an otherwise fun and vibrant picture. How this can be seen as groundbreaking or one of the best of the year, I may never know. Films like Under the Skin, Whiplash and The Grand Budapest Hotel seem far more unique in their execution and ideas than Birdman, a film which thinks of itself as if it is the opus of cinematic expression in 2014. It's a great film all the same, whether or not you can move past the ego that is obviously at play all throughout.",

Riggan battles against the cast, his family, his agent, critics, but mostly his own ego which comes in the form of his former alter-ego.\nKeaton is quite the perfect casting in the lead role, but he heads up a delightful stellar ensemble. The story has notes of Woody Allen in it, especially as it is ensconced in New York, but its wry snappy humour does help too.\nThe cinematography is quite something from Emmanuel Lubezki. Tracking shots flow out through walls, up and in through windows. The magical realism has some lovely subtle touches at the start, but in the last reel they do get a bit much. Brilliant editing though.\nTis a very wry look at acting. Cinema vs theatre. Art vs commerce etc. Sometimes things get a little too on the nose, but this is a fun time to be had.

            "content": "After the critically lauded Boyhood (which I didn't like) I entered the critically lauded Birdman with some trepidation but within just a few minutes I felt that I was watching something genuinely special. We begin by following an out-of-the-limelight actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) who is attempting to put on a Broadway play after 20 years of being known as the star of a Hollywood superhero franchise called Birdman. After an accident knocks out his underperforming co-star, Keaton is recommended to use the actor Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) who joins the ensemble, yet comes into conflict with all involved especially Keaton himself. As Riggan prepares for the preview shows, he is also seen battling with his relationships including the ever-watchable Emma Stone playing the \"hot mess\" of a daughter and with Andrea Risenborough (seen in the sci-fi Oblivion) as Keaton's possibly pregnant girlfriend. The acting is top-notch throughout with brilliant group dynamics and a cast that also includes Naomi Watts as a frustrated actress and Amy Ryan as his ex-wife. \n\nAlthough Edward Norton will be rightly regarded as playing a great supporting performance the real surprise here is Zach Galifianakis as Keaton's producer trying to help his client hold it all together. Zach to me is a cinematic jinx for me, playing the same unlikeable idiot in each film but here I felt he was much more suited to the straight man role as the Producer trying to keep it all together emotionally and financially. Although flashes of his comedy were here, it was all part of the story and played with a much lighter touch. The film includes both laugh out loud moments and tenderly played family scenes as well as metaphorical scenes of the metaphysical - as Keaton is shown floating and using telekinesis - which are brilliantly used when he trashes his dressing room and fights his \"alter ego\". \n\nYou could view the movie as a narrative on Hollywood versus Theatre - there's plenty of heavy handed moments involving critics as well as YouTube and social media commentary - or as a treatise on getting old and feeling relevant but it's the private moments and Keaton's subtle performance that stick with you most. One technical aspect of the film which never took me out of the movie (unlike Boyhood's unique conceit) was that the film 'appears' to be one shot. That's right, there are no obvious cuts at all in the film- digital trickery plus clever pans like Hitchcock's 'Rope' cover the breaks - but it works brilliantly as the camera floats around the actors, up the side of buildings and through windows whilst also using different devices to show the passing of time. \n\nAn enigmatic ending open to interpretation is fitting for a film that balances both sides of someone's self-image and the audience can bring their own views on the story at its conclusion. With a unique style, a group of actors playing to their strengths, a well-played out narrative and an interesting score (by jazz drummer Antonio Sanchez) Birdman is a great achievement and one I recommend you checking out before a no-doubt successful night at the 2014 Oscars.\n\n9/10 Midlands Movies Mike",

In fact it may be brilliant and I simply haven't realised it. Only time will tell. But in the mean time this is a wonderfully assembled comic drama with brilliant one take direction that needs to be seen to be fully believed (even if you can spot the joins), the amount of work that must have gone into it is unimaginable. The writing, despite the story not being what one would call overly substantial, is razor sharp; and as everyone who's seen this already have thus far said, the acting throughout the entire cast is outstanding. This has its sights set on the jugular to many different aspects of the entertainment industry, from the differences of attitude in stage and screen; with critics getting a good roasting, which is both fun and brave.

This film still possesses almost all of those qualities, but the chaotic plot distracted me a little bit, especially given the continuous-shot style (which is actually trademark of the film's cinematographer - Mr. Lubezki), which followed the intention of Inarritu and built an emotional bridge between the protagonist and the audience of being restrained and claustrophobic,  but I did not enjoy that much (except for the final shot with the big blue eyes of Emma Stone scintillating under the sunlight, which is simply perfect shot!). Still, this film has absolutely excellent cast, which are all very very cinematically beautiful (even the male characters) and very very able in their roles.

            "content": "\"Birdman (Or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" is a simply excellent film. Why? There is a scene in \"Birdman\" where Riggan Thompson (played by Michael Keaton), who is trying to direct and star in his Broadway adaptation of the Raymond Carver play \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\", walks towards the front of the stage and talks about love, what it is to be loved, and how we all crave that. But is it love we crave? Or, as Sam (played by Emma Stone) puts it, is Riggan confusing love with admiration? These are some of the many wide-ranging questions that \"Birdman\" leaves you with as you leave the cinema and you thus don't really realise how good the cast, direction, dialogue and score are until you've given up on those questions, realising that they are just too difficult to answer.\nThe cast is simply stellar in \"Birdman\", brilliantly led by Michael Keaton in what Variety's Peter Debruge calls the \"comeback of the century\" and which I agree with him over. However, I'm not sure if Michael Keaton would accept this title, in a recent interview promoting the film he laughed at the concept, yet the comparisons between his career and that of Riggans are unavoidable, he also laughed when this was bought up too. But, to be fair, all I knew of Michael Keaton before I saw \"Birdman\" was that he had starred in the 1989 \"Batman\" film as well as in its 1992 sequel \"Batman Returns\".  His career hasn't been stellar and it's a surprise I even knew his name before I saw \"Birdman\" really... But his performance in this film deserves all the attention he gets and all the awards he is being nominated for. Riggan is a complex character and you are never quite sure about him, how he feeling and how he feels towards others, not only because of how Riggan changes as the film goes on but also because of how that reflects the ever-changing nature of the film, moving from one question or theme to the other without actually leaving it behind, instead leaving it in the back of your mind for you to think about later.\nAgain, as I said earlier, the rest of the cast is great too. Edward Norton is brilliant (playing the self-obsessed, ego-driven actor who feels more real on the stage than off it, Mike Shiner). But then Miles is so much more than that and again it's hard to put your finger on what or who he is and what he is looking for. Zach Galifanakis (playing Riggan's agent, Jake) who is trying to keep Riggan grounded, is also brilliant and then so is Emma Stone and Naomi Watts (although both seem to be in very familiar roles). I could go on listing actors and actresses but it would just be a paragraph of names. (Last one I promise but Amy Ryan also does well playing Riggan's ex-wife Slyvia.)\nBut each of these is alleviated, and should thanking him in any of their Oscars speeches, by the film's director, Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. Alejandro hasn't done many English-Language films before (except Babel in 2006 and 21 Grams in 2003), and considering that, it makes his direction in \"Birdman\" even more outstanding. Where he really excels is in how \"Birdman\" is seemingly filmed in one take. These really emphasise how good the acting is in this film, be it a monologue by Emma Stone as she rants at her dad, a take that involves Michael Keaton walking in just his underpants through Times Square, or a scene where Keaton and Edward Norton rehearse on stage. What makes these one takes even better is how the film is almost entirely set in St. James Theatre and you really get a feel for it as you glide around it in these one takes, feeling, seeing and hearing everything that is going on. It truly is an experience. I loved every moment of it and what this ultimately did for me was make me feel like I was part of the production, as if I was being given this behind the scenes look at what was going on. This thrill inspired me to get back into acting, something that I used to do a lot of. What happens with this you as the film goes on, you begin to realise that this is less of a trip to the cinema and more of a trip to the theatre. It's a good mix of both and I can't really imagine it being the same on DVD, although it never is. I will definitely be seeing it again.\n\nBirdman's dialogue is great too and it matches the fast-paced score of \"Birdman\". Both are unique, with the dialogue being fast-paced, witty and blackly comic and the score being performed and composed entirely by the four-time Grammy winner and first-time film composer drummer Antonio Sanchez. Yeah. Drummer. The film's score is made up of two instruments, the drums and the cymbals. And it works perfectly! Its good not just because of how I haven't experienced something like this before, but also because it builds on that idea of you being a part of the production thanks to the one takes, but makes you feel as if that these drums are not just in your head and are there for benefit of the audience, but that they are in the actors heads. In testament to this, we occasionally see Sanchez' brother performing as we walk past be it in the theatre or in Times Square.\n\n\"Birdman\" is a unique film. And that is where its brilliance lies. Just like how when you are in a production and the curtains come down on closing night you come to think that you really did not want that to end, and I had the same feeling when \"Birdman\" did. Its cast, score and direction are all what will be directly nominated come the Oscars, but there is no specific award for the questions \"Birdman\" made me think about, the way \"Birdman\" made me feel and the lessons \"Birdman\" taught me.",

Edward Norton is my stand out in Birdman hes amazing I forgot he had this in him it's been a while since fight club but he showed his true power in this movie. not that hes ever really done poorly but this was just something special.\nEmma Stone and Oscars will be something you start to hear a lot together in the future, maybe even the near future she showed off her skill in this movie just with her facial expressions alone.\nMichael Keaton gives a career best  performance as well showing some range i never knew he had. Throw in a great supporting cast with great performances from Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough, and you have one of the best movies maybe of all time if not.. then surely of 2014. And its not that i think that the plot and story line are even that great, i mean they're really good but its basically a midlife crisis story about a recovering celebrity, that happens to have a great script due to some fantastic writing that meshed the comedy and drama so well. Capped off with some of the most beautiful directing and cinematography i have ever seen in my life, the whole one shot style that just follows everyone around was amazing. This movie is a must watch for any Cinephile Movie Enthusiast  8 / 10.",

The plot was great , the writing was better and mad props to the director the way the film was shot  and just put together had me interested the whole time just waiting to see what the next torcher this man must go through to leave his mark in the world .   Ill say this movie was astonishingly   deep and sad. Any one who says other wise didn't quit get the picture this movie was ridiculous there is just so much hidden meanings, symbolism and just plane craziness but if you can manage to wrap your head around all of it your left with a few ideas  OR if your me just one (im talking about the ending) SUPER SPOILERS DONT READ                                                                                           Im just ganna touch on what the directer meant with the ending(if he meant anything) . Look a blatantly sad movie can leave a bad taste in your mouth but this majestic movie found a way to give it the saddest ending ever while tricking people into thinking things are okay................ let me start   he definitely tried to kill himself  with the gun. he failed at his second try at suicide(when he was on the roof he was thinking about it )  Now when he woke up and lived . i only have ideas on why or how he felt  but he did 1000% jumped from that hospital window and died ya it looked like he  flew but that is not it  his daughter comes in the room to look for him  looks out the window looks down then looks up and smirks laughs whatever  but  the reason behind that  is  she had felt  he was never there for her or loved her enough she explains to edward norton then when she finally comes to her senses  that she was kind of being a bitch too  even though he still sucked at being a dad but no reason to hate him anymore and  she express  her new found love to him moments before  her  realizing he had left her again alone   witch is just really super ironic and funny in its own way therefore the laughing ...ALSO the man had attained everything   his family career money every thing  losing his sanity along the way  also i felt he had planed on shooting himself  when ed nortan told him to get a better gun or mainly when he was giving up on the play to zack  an he dumbly thought he helped by lying to him but just further pushed a man to suicide (gun was in a box loaded rdy to go on top shelf hidden)when he had the conversation with the movie critic she messed him up and he almost killed himself earlier than planned the good Samaritan saved him for him to soar to his real blaze of glory  witch he immiediatly tried and the man failed .  wish i was sure on why he jumped out the window to kill himself when he lived through the attempts  i'm guessing humiliation or sumthing deeper up to you ........ my first review i know is a  lil crude and lazy",

            "content": "The show biz satire and dissection of Hollywood, Broadway and fame in the film Birdman,  written, produced and directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, will either satisfy you or turn you completely off.  I have heard both from various people; I happen to belong to the former.  The film stars an extraordinary performance by Michael Keaton as the leading protagonist, Riggan Thomson, Edward Norton as Broadway actor, Mike Shiner, Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's lawyer and friend Jake, Naomi Watts as Lesley, Mike's girlfriend, Emma Stone, as Riggan's daughter, Sam, and Andrea Riseborough (Riggan's girlfriend Laura) and Amy Ryan (Sylvia, Riggan's ex-wife). The supporting cast, chosen well, only highlights Inarritu's script and directorial abilities.\nThe story deals with a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" written, directed and starring a faded Hollywood actor (Keaton) who was well-known for his superhero role as Birdman in an attempt to recapture some of his fame through this particular production. Is this reality imitating life? (Keaton played Batman twice in Tim Burton's versions of the same!)\nThe plot tells the story of Riggan (Keaton) who unfortunately is being besieged by the voice of Birdman, a character he became famous for, while he envisions himself performing some small acts of telekinesis and levitation.  He is hoping as I have already stated to reinvent his sagging career with the adaptation of Carver's short story in this Broadway play, being produced by Jake, and starring Riggan and his girlfriend Laura, plus Lesley, Mike's girlfriend.  Riggan's recovering drug addict daughter works as his assistant. Realizing that he needs a better actor in one of the supporting actor's parts, Riggan replaces him with method actor Mike.  During a preview, Riggan laments that he does not exist and shoots himself.  It is here that Riggan is advised by Mike to use a more realistic prop gun, and while reading the early reviews of the play, discovers that Mike has stolen the spotlight from him and that Mike is his daughter Sam's lover.  \nLocking himself out of the theater, Riggan has to walk through Times Square in his underwear to get back inside.  Running into critic Tabitha Dickinson, who lets him know that she really does not care for Hollywood celebrities who she believes pretend to be actors and will give the play a negative review, in essence, killing its chance for success.  Using a real gun for the final scene on opening night, he shoots his nose off while he is on stage, receiving a standing ovation.  In the hospital, he learns that the critic gave the play a positive review.  Sam visits and then leaves and returns to his room only to find him gone and the window open.  Looking up, she smiles while looking out at the sky.  \nThe film has been nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Score, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress and SAG awards in the same categories as well.  The screenwriters, Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. And Armando Bo, along with Inarritu have written a marvelous script, and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Oscar winner for Gravity) was filmed as if it was one continuous take going back and forth from reality to illusion with little or no break in the filming.  This is a very dark and twisted comedic film showing what someone's desperation can cause his behavior and actions to succeed in his chosen career that has hit the skids can do.  \nThe film, shot at the St. James Theater in New York City, begins with a quote from one of my favorite writers, Raymond Carver, whose short story the play being performed in the film is about and an excellent choice to explain what is happening in Riggan's life (and head).  I am not a big fan of voiceover and the film had more than enough scattered throughout the film, which to me was very annoying.  The use of drums also was used strongly and seemed to distract from the action on screen.  It is a well scripted and acted film. Plus makeup, costuming, dialog, acting, lots of close ups to show emotions...all done wonderfully!   If you haven't seen it, you should.  It is worth the price of a ticket, if nothing else then to see Michael Keaton (or his double) fly over the New York City skyline!  GRADE: 4 of 5 crowns",

Birdman.\n   Ten minutes in and the masters behind this wonder still had me believing it's all been shot in one take. The illusion holds up seamlessly by outstanding cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki, exceptional performances from all actors who are no doubt perfectly driven by the man at the helm, Alejandro Gonz\ucc3clez I\ucc70\ucc3crritu. \n   The writers of \"Birdman\" were certainly biting their nails as the story would have to be flawless... the illusion of one take has very little time for breaks. On the outside it would be easy to call this a simple tale of hardship, but told through the eyes of a washed up actor named Riggan (Michael Keaton), the writers have definitely created what could only be described as twisted perfection of story telling.\n  This is certainly Keaton's finest performance. Playing a washed up actor who starred as a super hero once upon a time, now trying to hit it big again with one last show. I'm sure Keaton used notes from his own career to drive this character, nevertheless he played the part to an absolute tee. Emma Stone and Zach Galifianakis are exceptional in their roles, but the award for best supporting role, in my opinion, would have to go to Edward Norton. Whether it would be through an awkward, disturbing or heart felt moment, his relationship on screen with all his fellow performers was an absolute pleasure to watch. \n   This film is an inventive leap forward for film making, a joy to watch and one that shall not be forgotten any time soon. Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance is a must watch for all movie goers.",

The character, driven by a career best performance from Michael Keaton, fits the films tension and anger. The cast backing up Michael Keaton is varied yet perfect, each character proves their own importance, no character feels forced or useless. Past the obscurity of what Birdman offers, the visual effects are inventive and intriguing, the sound mixing is flawless, and what a feat this has been for Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Never have I seen such a complex, thought-provoking and busy script be executed oh so carefully and proud than Inarritu's newest film. The film is left seamless, with not a hole or dent in the detailed plot. The film is worthy of any award it receives, due to the attention the film gives to details. Most movies now a days are about the big picture, or the plot twist ending, but Birdman's strongest moments fall within the detailed conversations between the cast, and the way Inarritu makes us think with reoccurring themes. The film is open to interpretations, but neither Keaton or Inirratu ever lost the vision. The vision was to create a study of self respect, and the angry tendencies of the human mind, and a whole lot more was achieved in Birdman than that single vision.",

It is seamless thanks to its editing and all comes together for a fantastic experience. Of course how could I forget the performances... they're amazing, just yeah. I could see this getting nominated for 3 out of the 4 acting categories (Oscars) and at least winning 1. This is a (dare I say it) masterpiece for the director. Even the soundtrack and writing, this movie is flawless, simply flawless. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't feel fully resolved with all the characters and plot threads and the ambiguous ending doesn't help resolve characters either.",

Birdman is both his 180, and proof that he can literally do anything he wants with a camera. Michael Keaton plays Riggen, a washed-up actor who's fifteen minutes of fame was years ago when he played the famed superhero Birdman. Dejected, drunk, depressed and estranged from his daughter, Riggen plans a comeback in the form of a broadway play he is directing, writing and starring in. Birdman is a smorgasbord of technical brilliance, as the script's diamond-cutting dialogue is hilarious once, dramatic then, and is merely a catalyst to move the narrative forward. Truth is, the Birdman is so deeply metaphorical, it's impossible to keep up with its trajectories. And the directing is one for the books, as Inarritu painstaking direction gives us the impression Birdman was filmed in one long continuous take, while the cinematography burns itself into your retinas. Incredible. One of the most captivating aspects of cinema is it's almost limitless capacity for creativity, but it's difficult to conceive of a film that can up the game further than this.",

            "content": "For every person out there, there is a time when, no matter who you are, will ask yourself that one big question \"Am I still relevant?\", this is no truer for artists themselves, musicians who continually have to shake their style up to sell records, Actors who have to take on a drastically different role from their previous outings, directors who have been out of the limelight for too long, or even an author putting pen to paper after writers block. Birdman addresses this question in the most hypnotic and emotional manner, not only producing one of the best ensemble performances I have ever seen period, but is so in a fresh and exciting way. Riggin is an aged actor, once famed with movie star dome in his box office smash Birdman, he has now plunged everything he has into a theater show on broadway in a last ditch attempt to ignite his flame. The previews are going less than to plan however and soon Riggin's mental state of mind is pushed so beyond the limit, himself and his team are forced to do dramatic things, in order to keep the show alive. As mentioned earlier this is not only wonderfully acted but perfectly cast, the casting agent in this film deserves an award, really. Michael Keaton as a washed up actor trying to stay relevant is not only powerful but true. Name the last time Michael was even at his peak, never mind big news, if this film does not ignite his career, nothing will. He plays Riggin, wonderfully, constantly arguing with his inner turmoil and cast, in order to make sure his dying effort is not in vein. Emma Stone plays his daughter, a stage hand, who is not long out of rehabilitation, she is a constant reminder to Riggin that his parenting skills have a lot to be desired for, the emotion in her eyes alone, tears your heart strings tenfold. Zack Galafanikis, who I dislike at the best of times, rattles forth a performance as a producer that gives Keaton a run for his money, although not always present he provides a sense of urgency the piece needs in order to feel the weight on Riggin's shoulders. Niaomi Watts as a wannabe big time star is a straight up winner, she has no reason to prove her talent at all, but this performance is another powerhouse, with some spot on comic timing. Edward Norton, christ, Ed knocks his role as a pretencious actor, who needs everything to be real on stage in order for him to get it right, is just a joy to watch. Even his sub story where he describes why he acts because anything off the stage doesnt make him feel alive. Its brutal and hilarious stuff all the way through. The look of the film is jaw dropping, give an award to not only the DP but the Steadi-Cam operator, who pretty much does 96% of the entire film. continually moving the camera to the exact point of focus we need. The film also runs on a never cutting away schedule, meaning it gives the illusion of it being continual, which not only helps the pacing of the film dramatically, but it weaves the story so magically together, I have never seen it does so professional before in my life and christ Hitchcock tried it. The writing is flawless, the soundtrack, the constant drumming, the background noise, makes the entire thing feel real, you feel there, not sitting in a cinema or a couch, you feel like your in the film. Finally direction, out of all Innaritu's films I have seen, this is by far the most superior. Everything slots into place, no stone is left untouched. Do I have any problems with the film? Yeah, some CGI moments cheapen a couple of moments slightly, but their inclusion is looked upon as not of this world anyway so it doesnt stick out like a sore thumb. Also the film ends about 8 minutes after it should. It's almost as if someone was afraid to go the whole hog, however the ending were left with feels magical, so yet again, nothing really wrong there. This film is easily one of the best films of 2014, yeah we've had some big titles, equally as stunning in different ways, but this, for what it is, and for how it makes you feel, it will be a long time until we are given something quite so wonderful again.",

            "content": "Wow! One of the most visually engaging and original films I've seen in ages, this story of slightly washed up 90s action star Michael Keaton (playing up to his Batman past) putting on a Broadway play is quite hard to categorise. Is Keaton going nuts? Does he really have superpowers like his Birdman character? Are super serious celebrated actors Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough taking the piss put of themselves and method acting? \n\nThere are so many factors that make this film so good. I LOVED the camera that follows the characters around, making the film seem like one long uninterrupted take. You really feel like you are there in the theatre with the actors, walking into dressing rooms and along the streets. Forget 3D, this is one of the most immersive films I've seen, taking you right into the scenes. Which makes the flights of fancy near the end when Birdman seems like he is turning New York into an action movie set, all the more dazzling. I guess director Alejandro Inarritu took note of fellow Mexican Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, which similarly redefined immersive camera work.\n\nThen there are the performances, led by Michael Keaton's manic lead Riggan, but ably supported by a never funnier Ed Norton, Emma Stone showing why she's one of the best young actors around. Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Amy Ryan play smallish, less showy roles but are still very good too. Comedian Zach Galifianakis plays it pretty straight while Lindsay Duncan is one of the most vicious critics we've ever seen on screen, dismissing Oscars as 'prizes for comics and porn' and totally unimpressed with Riggan's lack of theatre credentials. Everyone is excellent as they drift in and out of frame, to the centre then the periphery of the action. Michael Keaton has received a lot of praise and he carries the film well, although he isn't exactly a likeable, sympathetic or warm central character.\n\nThe script and story is another great thing about this film. I had no idea what was going to happen, what was reality, what was Riggan's hallucinations. There are some funny comments about the preponderance of superhero movies and social media these days. The Birdman alter ego appears onscreen, hissing vindictive bile in Riggan's ear like an anti-Jiminy Cricket. We get 5 minutes of an Avengers-like alien attack on Broadway as Riggan's Birdman character seems to take control. Then there is that ending. Huh??! What was real?\n\nThis isn't an easy film to categorise. It's not quite a comedy, but has a lot of black humour for a drama. However, Inarritu's previous films 21 Grams and Babel were so grim, this is positively laugh out loud funny by comparison I guess! The characters aren't lovable or even particularly likeable, but this is definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time and I'm keen to see it again to see if it holds up. Oscar nominations are surely on the cards!",

            "content": "It's a bit hard to explain my feelings for this film. There was certainly a lot to like about it. I even enjoyed watching it most of the time. And then there were the art-school touches that kinda made me throw up my hands. The movie starts off very slow. I suppose it was important to give one brief moment of calm before the chaos started but the film takes about twenty minutes before you're really given an idea where it's going. Once it begins it's basically a long slippery slope as things slide completely out of control. Some of the best scenes come from that chaos, including Edward Norton as a ridiculously method actor, a scene where Michael Keaton gets locked out of the theater in the middle of his own performance and has to walk around the building to the lobby in his undies, and another where the laws of reality seem to completely vanish amid flying and explosions. Keaton's great in here by the way. The entire film is made in one take, or at least the illusion of one take, and this adds an immediacy and sense of liveliness to the film. It's a big part of what makes the film unique. \n\nIt's very apparent that I saw the film differently from the creators. From the way they speak of it they view a superhero actor trying to redeem himself by doing serious art an inherently noble pursuit. I saw it as just another desperate attempt for him to receive the adulation he so craves, only this time with a new audience. So to me, there was nothing inherently wrong with his starring as a superhero. He doesn't need redemption so much as crave celebrity. It seemed more like a defence of such roles since he is constantly being belittled by others for not having the credentials needed to star on broadway. I saw his opponents as incredibly snobbish and elitist and didn't realize that, while they are supposed to be snobbish to an extent, I was supposed to listen to them and realize they were also partly right. Whoops. I'm glad I didn't know that going in. It would have annoyed me for the whole film. Maybe that's the mark of a good film: that it can be interpreted in multiple ways. But there's another part of me that feels that there was a whole level of subtext I was just blissfully ignorant of. I'd never heard of the short story they were adapting so I never realized they were poking fun at his crassness and intellectual pretensions by having him put on an unfilmable play. In this case I think ignorance is bliss.",

And with that in mind 'Birdman' (As I will be shortening it to) and it's camera work are inseparable. Obviously if the rest of the film is terrible then the camera may as well be used by a 2 year old. No such issues here as the rest of it is pretty damn good.\n\nBringing in the new year in a fantastic manner 'Birdman' is a slightly quirky, hilarious and dark film about a man's troubles to taken seriously. It's set leading up to opening day of Riggan's (Michael Keaton) play. He struggles with his own psyche, his former roll as 'Birdman' a super-hero follows him around - telling him the hard truths he doesn't really want to hear. The story spans no longer than a handful of days and with the rolling cameras really feels like one take. Occasionally it switches to others in his life - daughter 'Sam' (Stone) and other cast members 'Mike' (Norton), 'Lesley' (Watts), 'Laura' (Riseborough) and solicitor 'Jake' (Galifianakis). It's all backed up by a fantastically frantic soundtrack of drums and symbols. Close ups when in deep conversation and following behind in the tight corridors of back stage.\n\nit's really a non-stop ride that is full of the things that go wrong with Riggan's play - and the bits that go right. Some of it isn't real some of it is in his head, which makes you wonder how much of it is actually 'real'. It's deeply funny with ridiculous lines like: \"yeah, she does look like she's licked a homeless guys ass\". At times it may be dark (mostly) towards the end as he starts to unravel (and the ending itself depending on your view) - but I always had a great time watching it. I don't know whether it was the camera, the hilarious delivery of lines or just the outstanding performances all round. But it was just a joy to watch. the side characters may appear somewhat shallow at times as it has a fair few side story threads going on but the interactions are always interesting.\n\nMany have described this as Keaton's best ever performance and it's easy to see why - he's magnetic and slowly unravelling as 'Riggan'. Has the type of humour I believe is severely missed in comedies now and that wonderful camera work - and yes I'll keep taking about it. I saw this on Jan first and I can't think of a better way to kick of the new year than with 'Birdman'. Crafted with expertise, I get the feeling that everything just fell into place with 'Birdman'. I may have some very minor issues but I had such a good time they're obsolete. Funny, dark and flowing.",

I seriously could have watched this for another 3 hours or so, it's just so good.  \nFirstly, I love movies that are about Hollywood and the entertainment industry.  I love that cynical self-examining tone, and this nails it.  Michael Keaton plays a somewhat washed up actor who never quite topped the success he had playing \"Birdman\" in a series of superhero films.  Now he's trying to earn respect from his peers by adapting a book into a Broadway play to show that he isn't just some one dimensional blockbuster-type, he's an artist too!  Michael Keaton plays it brilliantly because, of course, his career sort of emulates that of his character - he played Batman, and since then he's kind of faded into the background.  \nAll the performances are great, from Keaton, to Emma Stone and Edward Norton - Norton especially, he's hilarious.  \nThere's plenty of jibes at mainstream Hollywood, specifically at the comic book genre, and they lead to really funny exchanges between characters.  I don't know if it was an intentional thing to cast actors who had dabbled in superhero movies in real life, I mean, we know Keaton is an obvious one, but Edward Norton played the Hulk, and Emma Stone is in the new Spider-Man films too.  Either way, the actors knock it out the park. \nIt's really funny, original and at times, totally mad, but overall it's one of the best films I've seen for a long while.  It's just a shame it didn't end at that perfect spot.",

However, it seems Riggan will always live in his own shadow for having played the infamous role of \"Birdman,\" a blockbuster comic book adaptation he starred in twenty years prior to this.\n\nThe film is presented in one long, continuous shot, giving it a dizzying, maze-like effect akin to Keaton's state of mind as he constantly doubts himself and his mental stability. Every scene in the film is filled with thematic meaning, from its surreal imagery to its unnerving score. The film is also a fascinating character study on vanity, self-doubt, and fame, along with numerous other thoughts that buzz through Riggan's head-portrayed with comical perfection in voiceover form.\n\nUltimately, Birdman is a gorgeously stylistic and dense piece of cinema that demands to be analyzed and interpreted upon viewing.",

This has to be one of the most unique movies I have seen in quite some time and the talent brought to this film is astounding. This movie was filmed to look like it was done all in one take and that is one of the many reasons to see the film. This film brings together one talented cast and you can tell that every actor was fully committed to their material and played their characters so well. This is probably the best performance I have ever seen Michael Keaton give and he handles his funny and dramatic scenes really well. His role in this movie kind of resembles Michael Keaton as an actor and he was the perfect actor to play the part. He highly deserved his Golden Globe win and his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Edward Norton also gives one of his career best performances and it refreshing to see another great performance from him. I also thought that Emma Stone gave the best performance of her career and she had some really memorable scenes. Zach Galifianakis was actually really good in this film and he shows us that he can really act and play somebody else other than Alan from the Hangover movies. Naomi Watts and the remaining members of the cast all brought something to the film and I can't praise the acting enough because it was just fantastic. Another aspect that really shined was the brilliant directing from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. With this film, he really shows he direct a movie with such skill and passion and he works to get the best from his actors. The interesting story and characters matter in this film and they were presented in a way that was engaging from scene one. Emmanuel Lubezki shows us once again that he is a master at his craft when it comes to filming a movie. He has filmed Gravity from last year and won a much appreciated academy award for Best Cinematography for that film and I think he will take home that same award for this movie. His ability to be able to film a lot of long takes is brilliant and his scenery is always great to look at. The way the team behind the film edit it did a flawless job making the movie look like it was done in all one take was something different and refreshing to see. In the end, this movie is a must see for anybody who loves movies and it is a front-runner to win Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards.",

            "content": "A truly exhilarating, inventive and breathtakingly original film with an achingly superb central ensemble cast and some visionary direction by Innaritu. \n\nThis was the one of this year's batch of Oscar grouped films I was wariest of; it featured a stellar cast and had opened to some glowing festival reviews but always seemed a little too intense, a little too pretentious for my liking. Perhaps this just wouldn't be my thing: both Interstellar and the almost universally adored 12 Years A Slave had both passed me by as films that I really couldn't stomach for the run time (particularly in case of the former's testing 3 hour marathon).\n\nI did, of course, love this film.\n\nTechnically marvellous in the truest sense of the word, Birdman skims through its run time with such poise and grace, ripping up ordinary conventions of the cinema and serving the adoring audience a plethora of messages and ideas (some perhaps subtler than others) in the form of a masterful cinematic invention of only the highest class.\n\nWhilst I must disclose that I have never actually had the chance to see any of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's past work other than glimpse a few shots of Buitiful (2010), I gather the 'gimmick' used in this feature (a word used politely in this instance, similarly to Boyhood) is not a recurring feature of his films and so is arguably completely unique in the fact that it was elegantly stitched together to create the look of a movie shot in one continuous take. Indeed, (save for the initial shot of a meteor crashing towards earth and the final scenes) the film grabs us from Keaton's first mediation shot and slams the door shut, not letting go and immersing us in the claustrophobic interior of a theatre and the oh so troubled lives of the people currently inhabiting it. Whilst done before (most notably with Hitchcock's 1948 film Rope) this trick is undoubtedly used to far greater effect and done so proficiently that one can only sit back in awe, appreciating the sheer dedication and persistence to this project unfolding effortlessly on screen.\n\nAside from the technical triumphs of this film, as with Boyhood, the performances are equally vital to the film's success. Keaton is of course the shining star of this piece, playing perhaps an extension of the man himself with anxious unease and roaring instability. The supporting cast, meanwhile, is composed both of those who have provided mild to moderate irritation on previous works (Zach Galifianakis) and also those who have made me want to gauge my eyeballs out using only Ebola infected floss (Emma Stone) but, through the work of miracles (or just wonderful direction from I\u00f1\u00e1rritu) are tolerable and even, dare I say it, enjoyable at times as the churn out the performances of their career.\n\nRich with subtexts, Birdman constantly reminds viewers of its overarching messages, some times perhaps less gracefully than others (Norton's Shiner preaching at a preview early on in the film comes to mind) with messages of the drive for fame and the ambition to be respected (\"popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige\") running through the veins of this movie.\n\nWhilst most of the opinions offered up aren't particularly groundbreaking in their message, they're presented so skilfully it's impossible not to just go with it. Accompanied by a relentless drum kit soundtrack, Birdman hurtles along at a breakneck and often frantic (perhaps indicative of Riggan's mental state) speed and could never be accused of meandering at any point in the movie.\n\nWhen the film finally jolts to a halt at, the electrifying energy of this thumping movie had been injected into me and I left the screen illuminated and positively thrilled about what I'd just seen. This felt like a classic. This felt like one of the best of the year.\n\nIt was unashamedly frenzied at times, but the culmination of a hugely engrossing filming technique, the seamless merging of surrealism and harsh reality and a savagely funny (and yes, it's hugely funny at times) satire delivered through beyond Oscar quality acting made this film utterly compelling viewing.\n\nOscar-wise, it is pretty likely this will win Best Picture now (having swept the board precursor wise) and such a win would undoubtedly be deserved as this is undoubtedly the best FILM of the year, whilst Boyhood is the best cinematic experience and a film I simply love more.",

            "content": "When a movie is titled Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) you better believe it's going to be a pompous, pretentious piece of cinema.  I'd kind of like to call it a piece of something else but I'll try to keep this review tasteful.  Upon first hearing of the rave advanced reviews this movie was getting, I was happy to see that Michael Keaton is having a comeback.  He's always been an underrated actor who had some very interesting film roles early in his career.  But I remember seeing some of the trailers for the film and not really liking anything about them.  Maybe they were saving the good parts for when you actually see the movie, right?  Wrong. \nIt looks like my intuition was right.  But then that kind of means that all the critics are wrong.  Well this is all subjective of course, but yes, sometimes movie critics see something that's a little different from other films and they go crazy for it.  Especially once there's the slightest talk of Oscar buzz.\nAs for the plot of the movie, it's actually pretty simple.  Keaton plays an actor named Riggan Thomson who rose to fame playing a superhero named Birdman.  He then falls from grace by choosing not to do a third sequel and moves onto other things.  This is a bit similar to Keaton's own experience playing Batman in the first two films and then not doing the third or any after that.  He had some other hit films but his career eventually faded.  So his character Riggan decides to stage a play which he will write, direct, and star in to get some of the acclaim that he's been missing for years.  But when the big-name actor he hires for the role winds up being difficult to work with, it puts both the play and Riggan's comeback in jeopardy.  The whole film pretty much revolves around the play.  I mean that literally; most of the scenes are on the stage itself or backstage in dressing rooms.  It tries to emphasize the character's inner struggle between selling out and going back to the Birdman role or simply finding peace within himself no matter how bad his career may seem.\nThe one real positive thing I could say about the film is that the director does a great job at making the whole film appear as if it's been shot in one take.  The camera follows characters from one scene to another and it's unnoticeable when the camera switches to a new shot.  But this really is one of the most pretentious films I've ever seen.  It's full of one arrogant artsy shot after another.  The movie even begins with a shot of Keaton in his underwear floating in the air sitting Indian-style.  In fact, there are numerous scenes of him in his \"tightie-wighties\" as if to say look at how he's baring his soul on screen and letting it all hang out!  Even the music is pretentious.  There are no actual songs played in the movie and barely even a musical score.  All we get is the sound of drums being banged on as the character walks through hallway after hallway.  It's loud and supposed to stir up the dramatic tension that other music normally would.  But that's all it is, an alternative that makes the scene no better.  And there are so many metaphorical moments of the actor flying in the sky or controlling objects with his thoughts as if to show that he's still in full Birdman mode.  It's all just really ridiculous.  And it's sad to know that this movie will most likely be nominated for multiple academy awards including Best Picture.  I can think of plenty of other movies I'd rather watch this year that don't try so hard and scream Oscar at all the people who think they're watching a unique piece of art.  I just feel like I watched a so-so movie.",

I think everyone should watch this film at all costs. \n\nit is a truly inspiring film that is masterful written with a ending that is not only shocking, but strange and appalling for what it is. It pushes our ideals and look on the world that we have come to live in today.It pushes how we see our dreams and desires and just how far we are willing to take them.\nIn today's film world we see that the superhero genre is growing with films like Man of Steel, The Dark Knight, and The Avengers, but we can't help but ask ourselves do these characters, actors, directors have anything for themselves outside of just being the big superhero beat em up movies that they are. Well Birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance puts this question down on a silver platter and begins to ask these mind numbing questions that must be asked.\nWe see Michael Keaton take on the role of an actor gone mad after leaving his franchise known as Birdman. He has started to see things now look at strange images in the mirror along with hearing voices as well of his former self. He tries to discredit the voices as he pushes himself to become a true artist on the stage. he takes a huge risk much like the director does with this story. In this story we see a man try and tell a story on the stage that inspires people while at the same time he wants to shock them. He goes through rehearsal after rehearsal trying to get his audience to enjoy what was going on while he was on the stage. The actor also deals with his daughter who feels he is washed up and finished as an actor and makes fun of him for trying so hard.\n\nThe actors really are what helps to make this movie work as Emma stone gives us a stellar performance as the daughter upset a disgusted with her dad whilemi Watts helps build the structure. However neither Naomi Watts nor Emma stone ever take the spotlight off Keaton at any point and help make the movie feel well rounded.\n\n\nNow what is stopping this from being 5/5 well while this movie is defiantly gonna win a Oscar it still has some hurdles. For instance the lesbian scenes and side story with Emma Stone was dry cut and never went anywhere aside from giving the audience loads of fan service to watch. Which is fine I just believe in having some balance in fan service, but I am not going complain to much. Though I wish there was more to this than what we got.\n\nEither way Birdman is a amazing film that you should get everyone seeing you know.",

Not the first of its kind (others like it is David Lynch's great Mulholland Drive and Darren Aronofsky's shallow Black Swan), Birdman stands out due to superb acting (Michael Keaton-the former Batman-potentially playing a warped version of what his own career could have panned out to be, is magnificent as the titular Birdman), great production design (the film takes place in a singular playhouse that feels lived in and has a distinct personality) and is all tied together due to a persistent and focused direction from I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. His bold and steady film aesthetic is a departure from his erratic and choppy style from his past works (including 2006's Babel and 2010's Biutiful). Part of this is due to I\u00f1\u00e1rritu working first time with the long-take expert Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki (2006's Children of Men-shot by Lubezki-is a clear inspiration for I\u00f1\u00e1rritu) as the two orchestrate a seamless exploration within the labyrinth of the playhouse, but more importantly, the labyrinth of the mind. As the stream of conscious-like surreal filmmaking begins to up the tempo throughout the picture, it would be easy to label Birdman as a pure visual experience.  Although it is visually magnificent, everything you see is directly tied to the characters, where every minute detail tells us more about the story. The amount of forethought that went into Birdman and the general ease that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and all of his collaborators display oozes confidence that is rarely seen in cinema. To label the film in one paragraph is too little, but Birdman is an achievement in cinematic vision from everyone involved and will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact.",

Presented as a single, unbroken hand-held camera-shot, 'Birdman' is relentless, picking up the viewer like the levitating Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) in its opening scene and refusing to put them down as they laugh, cry, rage and fly with Keaton for the duration of the film. The screenplay is brutally self-aware, with the Birdman character and in-movie actor names seeming to be the only fictionalised aspects, as pop-culture references and icons of the 20th and 21st centuries are ruthlessly deconstructed. This is Keaton's show of course, in a career-defining role played as only he could, but it couldn't be done without the stunning supporting performances or I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's intense direction.\n\nBy no means a throwaway film, 'Birdman' will command your attention from start to finish, but that's not to say it won't be enjoyed by fans of indie-film and superhero-movies alike. \nNever has the phrase 'the lie that tells the truth' seemed more appropriate...",

            "content": "Every once in a blue moon there comes an experiment film that every director wants to make or actually does helm it. They don't know if it is going to work, they don't know if it will win audiences, they just go forward into the unknown hopefully their movie is liked. BIRDMAN is Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu's experiment film and has now won the prestigious Best Film at the Oscars this past Sunday. Technological wise it is great, not THE HOBBIT great but even better because it utilizes few CGI to keep the story rolling. I also would like to mention that the film is a one shot film for an hour and 43 minutes. Wow. When I first saw the film in theaters, I was sucked into the film that I didn't even notice that it hadn't cut for a while. Once I noticed, I wanted to see how long it had gone without a cut. That's just impressive, there are a lot of closeups, tracking shots, Steadicam shots and it all takes place inside the theater where Riggan Thomson (the legendary Michael Keaton) is conducting his play.\n\nThe camera follows this great ensemble inside the theater, outside the theater, into bars, into alleys that it just creates this \"following\" illusion that you're just ALWAYS there next to the actors, I really loved this style of filming. I've read many articles stating that one shots are very hard to do, they always mention the opening shot of Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL as the originator of the one shot scene. More recently they mention Alfonso Cuaron's opening ten minute opening to GRAVITY and the motorcycle chase scene in CHILDREN OF MEN. There have been a lot of good one shots and when you see them you are just in awe of this technique. But enough of this technique, I feel like I'm rambling on, let's talk about the film shall we?\n\nRiggan Thomson is a washed up actor who starred in the popular billion dollar franchise BIRDMAN. He's trying to revive his career by adapting a Raymond Carver play, he tells one of his fellow actors that what made him want to be an actor was the time when Carver wrote on a cocktail napkin that he had \"a great performance\" when Thomson was a kid performing in a school play. Riggan is so caught up with his Birdman character that he hears Birdman's voice in his head all the time, but he comes off as a perverted, manic, much more vulgar version of Birdman. Maybe this is what Riggan is ACTUALLY thinking but is too scared to say? A lot of people believe that this is loosely based on Keaton's own career having done BATMAN and whatnot now trying to revive his career with this film and Keaton nails it. If Eddie Redmayne wasn't nominated along with him, Keaton would have won the Oscar for this film. It was a great performance but Eddie just took it one step further by portraying Mr. Hawking. How do you explain Riggan's secret levitating? Is it all in his mind? Was he high? The ending was a little weird, hence the four and half star rating instead of five but all in all it is a triumph for Inarritu who has had a great film career so far ever since he burst onto the big screen with his gritty and raw directorial debut in AMORES PERROS. It was just a matter of time before he won a Best Director Oscar. Great film.",

Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are on top form throughout this film, a perfect scene to watch out for is when they are rehearsing on stage with each other, they play off each others performances brilliantly. The merging of diegetic and non-diegetic sound is another unorthodox element that this film experiments with and the results are incredibly immersive. To summarise Birdman is technical masterpiece which satires our modern society and outlook on other individuals within that society, though it may not be for everyone it's definitely worth a watch purely due to the amount of passion that has gone into making it.",

At the center of it all are its phenomenal performances with Michael Keaton turning in some of the best work of his career and surrounded with a talented ensemble with impressive showings from Emma Stone, Edward Norton, and Naomi Watts.",

I also love \"Beetlejuice,\" \"Night Shift,\" and more...so to see an actor like Keaton, who I've always felt was a little underrated finally get some praise for his acting abilities in a big bad way, I couldn't be happier.  The film is tremendously inventive, it is shot to like like you are just flowing through the movie, as if it is all one shot.  The story is solid and the characters are all alive...but it is Keaton who knocks you out here. Norton is great as a parody of method actors...who can't actually act if he can't completely buy whatever he is supposed to be acting in.

            "content": "It's a bird, It's a plane, actually it is a bird! It's Birdman!!! And definitely one of the best movies of 2014. Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu's directed \"Birdman\" stars Michael Keaton as Riggan, an aging actor who had his thespian heyday in the early 90's playing an iconic superhero named Birdman. And do I have to hit you with a bat on your head, to discover the irony in this since in the early 90's Keaton himself played.... well, you know the rest, or at least I hope you do. Well, anyways back to the current Riggan era. Riggan is now in production of a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver novel. He stars, wrote the adaptation, and is directing the play. It is here where \"Birdman\" flies with greatness as I\u00f1arritu brilliantly sends us to the backstage Broadway theatre world, and shows us all its complex eccentricities and politics. Alejandro the Great also scribed up a very witty \"Birdman\" screenplay with co-writers Nicolas Giacabone, Alexander Dineralis, and Armando Bo. Michael Keaton was more than phenomenal as Riggan, and Keaton is deserving of all the award love he is receiving. The supporting work of \"Birdman\" also did not fly the coup. Edward Norton was spectacular as Mike, a feisty Broadway actor. Emma Stone was standout as Riggan's daughter Sam. Zach Galifianakis was superb as Riggan's lawyer Jake. Watts out, here comes another brilliant acting effort from Naomi Watts', here playing the emotional-wreck theatre actress Lesley. And other solid supporting work were delivered by Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, and Lindsey Duncan. But this was really Michael Keaton's main stage, and he kept us birdwatching throughout his stupendous performance. My only minor flaw of \"Birdman\" is the one-too-many fantasy-like scenes, but that was just a minor mishap in the \"Birdman\" nest. So rise up and catch the \"Birdman\". \n***** Excellent",

The film is shot as if the film was done in one take. Therefore I commend the film on its choreography. This is definitely a film that will get some nominations.\nThe film tells the story of a forgotten star who is producing and starring in a play to stray away from his superhero past. Really the play is done to boost his ego as he feels that he is not relevant. One can say it is a satirical look at the star Michael Keaton. An actor who hit it big with Batman and kind of wither away after Batman Returns. Sure Keaton has done some great performances. But much like any actor that goes into a role of a superhero or Bond, will always be known for their big role.\nThe style of the film depicts the main star as a manic depressive who's trying to show the world that he is a true actor. I love the surreal scenes of him using telekinesis or the scenes of him flying. The voice that we hear in the characters head, is his inner ego pushing him to make another Birdman so he can be relevant again.\nThat's what makes the film work for me is relevancy. All of the characters want to be relevant and matter to the world. It also deals with themes of how the big New York Broadway scene views big Hollywood actors.\nGreat performances from Edward Norton as the completely vain Broadway star. His performance really sells for me as I always viewed him as the hardcore actor that is so dedicated to his work that his ego makes him shallow to everyone else. Another great performance from Emma Stone as Keaton's daughter. Her character has been ignored by her father during her childhood. Her character has dealt with a lot of depression to relieve her from the strained relationship she has had with her father. But who really shines is Michael Keaton.\nOverall this film was interesting, creative and different. It is an unconventional film, a must see.",

To put it simply, Michael Keaton is powerfully charismatic, and only fails to steal the show when having to share a scene with Edward Norton.  Shot by Emmanuel Lubezki (the DP who shot Gravity) Birdman is just as visually interesting as it is confounding.  A movie about an actor who was in a movie and is now doing a play, there are moments that feel like they were drawn from old-school behind-the-scenes plays and films like Noises Off or Bullets Over Broadway, but there's a spiritual through-line that's difficult to ignore.  The entire cast is solid, though, and they better be, since they're the only things anchoring this film, which is essentially the fever dream of \"How To Make It On Broadway for Dummies\". Never once acknowledging the line between reality and fantasy, Birdman glides above everything, allowing the audience to draw its on conclusions.  Redemption, success, life, love, all the big themes are explored in a film that I'll easily love watching over and over again.",

You don't move from location to location as a scene ends, you move with Keaton's character as he interacts with people and you continue with him through the movie. The acting by Keaton is amazing no doubt and he deserves the praise and awards he's recieving, but this movie is full of great performances. Edward Norton and Emma Stone both do a great job as you might expect, but Zach Galifianakis really shows how good of a actor he is this movie.

Artistically filmed, as it's also directed with blurred imagery of fiction and reality (what was imagined vs real). This film also takes a stab at critics, Hollywood productions, feeble minded audiences, social media and etc. Edward brings life to the film during the slow development phases.

But put that all aside, and it's a simple allegory about how each one of us continuously redefines our relevance.  An individual's relevance is completely subjective, and it changes throughout his or her lifetime (and the changes accelerate as the years do).  Whether you want international celebrity success, or to be a star in your own household, it's entirely your job and it doesn't stop until you do.  That's why life is so tiring, but interesting.

This pretentious holier than thou anti-mainstream media waste of human resources will make you demand your money back two hours of your life back and your memory to be erased. Spoilers ahead.\n\nNone of the characters are likeable. Edward Norton's stood out as king of the a-holes. I did not root for the airborne micro organisms that were doomed to the terrible fate in participating in this orgy of pretentiousness. I am personally insulted that this film tries to emulate \"Rope\" the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece with its filmography style. Alejandro Gonzalez, whoever you are, you are not Alfred Hitchcock you don't deserve to shine his shoes. I never thought I would ever be so bored with a lesbian encounter involving Amy Ryan that came out of nowhere, was never brought up again and paid no contribution to the film other than to suck in more audience, which if you think about it makes the director a hypocrite since the whole message of this stupid movie is that mainstream is for idiots and you shouldn't compromise your artistic integrity to sell more tickets. How self-righteous.\n\nWhich brings me to my next gripe of the film. Michael Keaton's very involvement. He participated in a film that spits in the face of hollywood. Listen up, Mike. Without all those \"apocalyptic porn\" films you say are so mindless YOU WOULD BE NOWHERE! You would be nobody. These executives made the name Michael Keaton a household name and how do you repay them? Spitting in their faces and calling them greedy. You were Beetlejuice, you were Batman and now you are an emulation of your true self. A washed up, out of work rock star who now stars in a bunch of pretentious bull crap nobody cares about or will remember in a hundred years.\n\nThis whole movie hints that the voice talking to Keaton's character is in his head and that his powers aren't real since a scene prior to the ending implies clearly they are not but the ending implies that they are. YOU CANNOT DO THAT! You need to establish the rules to your world. Twist endings do not work that way. You need it to make sense.\n\nLet's talk about the ending. You're going to love this. These geniuses fake out Michael Keaton's character's death FOUR TIMES! The first fake out is him jumping off the building and I'm like \"Okay the movie's over. Okay. Pretty well rounded.\" And it shows him flying. \"Okay so he's gonna hit the ground and die. We get some neat visuals and a little chuckle out of the sudden change of mood.\" No he lands on his feet and goes to the theatre inexplicably. So then he uses a loaded gun as his stage prop for the climatic suicide scene in his stupid play. \"Ok cool he's going to kill himself in front of thousands of people as one final screw you to the world\" He wakes up in the hospital missing his nose and I'm like \"OH MY GOD JUST END!\" He jumps out the window. \"Finally he's dead. Now I can go home and watch a real movie.\" Emma Stone's character looks up and laughs. \"WHAT?\" \n\nThis movie is stupid! It is stupid in every single angle! Nothing makes sense. It's an artsy, annoying, immature college freshman perspective of the world that tells the critics of Hollywood what they want to hear and they eat it up. I would rather watch The Room than this movie again. I would rather marathon four episodes of Frasier than watch this movie again. I would rather drink an entire bottle of Muscle milk and down it with tonic water than watch this movie again. \n\nI hate it!",

The screenplay is fantastic. The meaning of its alternate title, The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, is a perfect metaphor. \n\nThe setting of the film is the St. James Theatre in New York, a sparse and bedraggled venue. Behind the scenes, relationships are repeatedly tested. The characters are plagued with conflict between truth and dare, love and the quest for immortality. \n\nThe main character too, is sparse and bedraggled. As the man in charge, Riggan Thompson's agony of doubt is so exquisitely tense; he seems to go in and out of his head as often as he rips off his wig. He is literally possessed of the super-power of movie stardom, yet struggles to cast it off like an addict yearns to deny his drug. \n\nAlso inherent in the screenplay is theatre's comparison to film, and especially to CG action films, which dominate general audiences and make stars into super heroes. How can Thompson's bid for meaning hope to survive against the flash of his former film persona? \n\nEnter an accidental viral video as the play's literal deus ex machina, and the second title is foreshadowed, but not defined. Thompson, in an ill-advised attempt toward greater reality, is destined to take matters into his own hands. In the end, we are left with only our willingness to suspend disbelief. \n\nBirdman, the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, is a perfect social commentary, besot with tragic irony. It is artfully delivered in a screenplay bridging ancient to post-modern storytelling where the real struggles to overtake the surreal. \n\nThis film shows exactly how far passion can go to drive one to the edge. It also shows how the public yearns to embrace this concept, as the only place art can be in order to be true.",

Director Alejandro G. Inarritu brilliantly skewers everything from Hollywood to Broadway, fame to art, mere existence to making a difference. Using the real St. James Theatre in New York as his labyrinthian canvas, Inarritu has crafted a surreal, dark comedy that was constructed as if to appear in one single, very long, continuous shot - it is truly a virtuosic achievement. Inevitably tapping into its leading man's own cinematic history, \"Birdman\" earns its wings from a moving, textured, riveting performance by Michael Keaton. He is ably supported by top notch actors at the very top of their game: Edward Norton, overdue for Oscar, may finally earn the statue by playing the most pretentious, obnoxious, and indulgent of actors. Emma Stone, who continues to impress as her resume grows, portrays a galaxy of emotions so expertly that after one of her scenes I desperately wanted to applaud. The divine Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough also bring pathos and authenticity to their actress roles. Though ostensibly about the theatre, \"Birdman,\" with its stunning metaphors, imagery, and sound elements, exudes such cinematic flair that make it truly one of the year's very best.

Each performer within this inventive piece of cinema deserves Oscar recognition, as does its stellar cinematography (much like Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, the film flows as one singular shot, and its a marvel to behold).

My only problems with it are that it runs a bit long at times, though it is never boring, and some characters are not given full arcs such as Norton's character after being at the font of almost every scene.

When you hear about Emma Stone's character, you are a little wondrous to whether she can take on such a challenge but the outcome is monumental. The imagery this film creates, is unlike anything seen before. (Sounds cringe, but really is phenomenal). Alejandro Gonz\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1lez I\u00c3\u00c2\u00b1\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1rritu has a completely new style of directing, noticeable from the first scene. \"Birdman\" digs at the surface to give a sour taste of the 'real' Broadway. The music score is compelling, although the drums were repetitive. It seems the director wanted to give a drummer a chance and let his work be in a film, but you roll your eyes when you hear drums after the first half hour. I thought that Naomi Watts was good for Lesley but I thought if the director can change the way we look at Emma Stone, could Christina Applegate have played that roll? For the roll of (Riggan's ex-wife, Samantha's mum) I honestly think Allison Janney or Julianne Moore would've contributed far more than Amy Ryan. To end on a lighter note, the ending is great. It allows you to procrastinate on the whole film and just wonder and those people (like me) that quite often want an answer at the end of a film, won't get one but won't be unsatisfied.",

I had seen some of the previews but after viewing how much praised it received, I was actually intrigued to know just how good it was. Plus, it's director Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00c3\u00b1arritu is a great director, and it also featured a star studded cast. And so, after watching the movie, it was inevitable to feel just a little disappointed because the movie wasn't what I was expecting. However, it was an excellent film nonetheless. What amazes me the most, was how it seemed as if it was shot continuously as if it was a single shot, and how amazing the score and sound editing was thought the whole experience. It has been one of the few movies that have caught my attention of those aspects, and so that was new to me. Moreover, the acting was also a great factor of the movie, mainly Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and-surprisingly, but not so much-Emma Stone. Keaton seems to be back with this great role, who he embodies almost too real to be true, it was amazing to see him make fun and play with what could be himself. Meanwhile Norton was excellent in every scene he was in, even if he was sometimes kind of a douche. And finally, Emma who to me reminded of how great of an actress she is, giving some of the most powerful and strongest lines in the movie. But overall the whole cast was on point. As to the story, the message was a very meaningful and important one, that truly comes through in the script and characters, with a lot of metaphors and imagery. And it's inclusion of fantasy really ups the movie and gives it this another level of craziness and fun. It serves as a great comedy, but also a very dark drama that even though it aimed times deviates in its story, it's pretty amazing to watch and be amazed of what an spectacular work I\u00c3\u00b1arritu and Emmanuel Lubezki just accomplished. And I'm sure this will be one of the best movies of the year. \n~December 12, 2014~",

The acting in this movie is phenomenal with a powerhouse cast led by a redefining performance by Michael Keaton. The movie is about an actor (Keaton) who is basically washed up, most known for his role several years prior as the comic book hero \"Birdman,\" but now he wants to do something serious that actually requires \"real acting,\" so he turns to the theatre for which he adapts a script for a play and prepares for opening night. From here, the film takes many different turns, exploring, in very quirky, colorful, and funny ways, the man's frustrations, anxieties, insecurities, and, ultimately, his fear of rejection. A great detail that sticks out in this film is that there are a lot of very long takes in which the actors switch seamlessly between moods and tones in a matter of seconds. The camera work is also very dynamic; the camera is almost always in motion whether its circling around a table or traveling down a hallway. It is almost impossible to look away from the film because something is always happening; the movie moves very quickly from scene to scene, arousing the feeling that if you turn away you might miss something. I would definitely expect to see this movie showing up at the Oscars, particularly in the Best Actor/Actress/Supporting Actor/Supporting Actress categories. This is a very fun movie to watch in general, and, from the look of things, this movie will most likely become one of the overlooked gems of 2014.",

To become invested in the events happening on screen\n\nThis movie fails on all 3 counts.\n\nThe humor in this \"black comedy\" is relegated to jokes about genitals and faux molestation admissions. There are perhaps,\n4 or 5 of these instances peppered throughout the film. So this movie fails as a comedy.\nThe other praise being lobbed at this movie are the performances from Keaton, Norton,\nand Stone. Norton's presence is mystifying. His character essentially serves no purpose, as \nhe is meant to embody the swaggering bravado of Brando-esque method actors, but \ninstead comes off as an unpredictable jerk who doesn't even follow the \"rules\" of his\nown character.\nStone, on the other hand, is such a tired cliche that she almost isn't worth mentioning.\nHer schtick of being the emotionally fragile ex-druggie daughter is never fleshed out,\nnever interacting with anyone in a meaningful way except for a sexual tryst on a roof \nand the obligatory reconciliation with the dad who was never there.\nKeaton does a fine job here, even if he is overacting a bit.\n\nCompounding these issues is the decision to shoot the movie as if it was one continuous\nshot. Is it kinda neat to see? Yes. Does it add anything significant the the film? No.\nI've seen this done in other films, better I might add, and there the decision made sense thematically.\n\n\nMy main issue is the fact that so many plot lines are present but the film never really sees\nfit to close them, just showing them to the audience and letting them sit there. A lesbian \nsublot is introduced and then vanishes (???), Nortons' own romantic arc fizzles out to nothing,\nand the ending...well let's not talk about that...\n\nThere are ways to present an artful film without engaging in pretension. Unfortunately,\nit seems as though Inarritu has never seen Bunuel or Jodorowsky. The symbolism is as subtle\nas a sledgehammer and I can't help but feel a little insulted, paying $20 to watch a movie\nthat is essentially calling the audience morons.\n\nMy girlfriend wanted to leave after 20 minutes.

Also, it is something of a technical achievement in its apparently seamless editing which imitates the onstage feel of a play with a rotating background.

The bulk of the film takes place on the set of a Broadway play devised by former movie star Riggan Thompson (Keaton) and rarely strays.Riggan was once the title character in a would be superhero franchise that went belly up after he declined to return for another sequel, and he has been struggling to prove his worth ever since. There isn't a whole lot that is sympathetic about this guy. Riggan's ego has overtaken the more important things in his life, such as his relationship with his estranged daughter, Sam, played by the ever likable Emma Stone. The writing is rich, and the rest of the cast delivers in spades. Edward Norton is great as Mike Shiner, who is perhaps the manifestation of Riggan's acting aspirations in all of their self aggrandizing glory. Director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's talent behind the camera is evident in his brilliant single take tracking shots. In fact the whole film is structured like the Broadway play at it's center, with characters coming and going smoothly (sometimes not so smoothly). Birdman is frequently very funny, but it's also quite tragic. There is an element of Riggan Thompson's psyche that comes into play multiple times during the film that I won't divulge, but it leaves you with a lot to think about.",

Birdman is smart, inventive, beautifully shot, expertly acted, and about as perfect as a movie can be these days. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu has crafted a modern masterpiece with this film. Everything from start to finish is nothing short of masterful. This film's editing, cinematography, pacing, and overall look is groundbreaking. This was shot in a way that looks like it is all one panning shot. Every scene blends together in such an extrordinary way that it is almost impossible to describe. This is simply something you must see for yourself. The use of visual effects are also breathtaking with subtle exectioun to where this all looks natural and you believe whole heartedly that everything is on sceen. Inarritu's direction is clearly the star here but his writing and storytelling methods are just as spectacular. The story here is that a down on his luck actor, who is famous for playing a superhero named Birdman twenty years ago, decides to adapt a novel into a broadway play and try to revitalize himself as well as his career. The script here is absolutely solid filled to the brim with thematical elements, deep symbolism, and literary refrences to elevate this story to something beyond description. Inarritu uses very unconventional ways to tell the story that you instantly understand. Delivering this script is arguably the best cast assembled in a movie this year. MIchael Keaton plays the star Riggan and delivers the performance of his career. Keaton has such passion here and so much heart it is easy to see why he is getting all of the Oscar buzz now. Joining him are Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomie Watts, Zach Galifianakis, and Amy Ryan. All give beyond spectacular performances that should all be given accreditation for their efforts here. All in all Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) may be the best film of 2014. Everything here is flawless and there has never been a movie like this before and I doubt if there will be after. This is a cinematical achievement that only few directors and actors have ever achieved. Keaton and Inarritu have a lot to be proud of here and I can't wait to see how it fairs in award season. I encourage everyone to witness this film, you will be glad you did.",

However, the story is a hodgepodge of dangling the plot threads and missed opportunities. While it is true that Keaton's protagonist carries the film, The subplots with his daughter, the lesbian affair, and the failing marriage never tie into Riggin's journey, and these sections of the film leave me with more questions than answers. Also, the last shot of the film seems to change the rules established by the first hour and fifty-eight minutes. \nOverall, while the films performances are a joy to watch, the story fails to have any cohesion.",

This is fun. This is exciting.\n\nAs the title credits appear, it becomes apparent that they are almost exactly like those used in the opening of Jean-Luc Godard's acclaimed film, Pierrot le Fou. Such a decision is surely a bold move - attempting to emulate one of the greats is not something to be taken on lightly.\n\nThe film follows the story of ex-movie star Riggan Thomson, the leader of 90s film franchise 'Birdman', as he tries to shake off this reputational stereotype and make it in the world of Broadway theatre - by directing, writing and starring in his very first play.\n\nThe opening begins with our protagonist, Riggan, clad only in his underpants, floating in mid-air and meditating on the fact that his dressing room \"smells like balls\". Throughout the film, we are treated to many more surreal moments interspersed with the otherwise (fairly) naturalistic feel of the film. Fans of films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind will love this aspect.\n\nThe continuous shot effect (helped along by some very clever editing) seduces us viewers into the story. You'll feel exhilarated, like the scenes are live, happening right now, with us in the moment. It almost converts the film from cinematic expression to theatre, as we explore the backstage habitat, and pound the streets of New York. The fast paced nature of the film is helped along by the infectious percussion score - it almost feels driven by this wild and unstoppable beat.\n\nMichael Keaton is impressive as Riggan, finely balancing the tragedy and humour of his character, with the film itself as a satirical reference to his own real-life success as Batman in the 90s.\n\nEdward Norton is great as asshole actor Mike, and Emma Stone holds her own as disillusioned ex-addict Sam, a far departure from her usual sweet roles in films like The Help and the Spiderman series.\n\nIf Riggan is our Icarus of this fable, the New York Times critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan), who despises what he stands for, is our Greek Chorus, highlighting Riggan's internal struggle, the dirtiness of the film industry and the modern focus on celebrity lifestyle.\n\nThe film is visually stunning, particularly the shots of characters on the theatre stage. The score is perfect and the cast give it their all - no moment is left feeling lacklustre.\n\nThe themes of celebrity and art may be old, but the delivery is not. Awards will be showered on director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman.\n\nWords: Molly McGregor",

The movie is sorta bland, really weird, and is trying to shove a message down your throat about actors that I just didn't really care about.\n\n I thought Norton was the best, he had some pretty powerful performances. Keaton is a great actor, and I dig a lot of his movies, but his character was odd. Something was just a little off with him that I couldn't fully believe or relate to this Riggins guy.

The acting is off-the-charts outstanding and surprisingly Zach Galifianakis is one of the biggest highlights holding his own with the greats around him. The story and actors involved are very much winking at the audience with Keaton and Norton playing spoofs of their own careers, and the conversations between characters very much pointing out the flaws with Hollywood filmmaking; and it was wonderful to hear! It is definitely for lovers of film as the techniques, surreal direction, pitch-perfect acting, and very original score (being percussion only) may go unnoticed by the average viewer. I don't think it's a perfect film as the ending left me a bit cold and after much speculation, it became difficult to reach a fitting conclusion and I could've used more clever integrations of the Birdman character himself, but it is the whole package in terms of ingenuity and is a power-house acting bonanza!",

            "content": "The 2014 film Birdman leaves one feeling buoyant and calm at its end. Like a buoy resting in the ebb of the sea's deliberate churning, the movie rises and falls between lulls of set up and crests of conflict in strokes of intense passion and flourishes of absurd quirk. \nThe characterization in this film is spot on. The actors show the eccentricities of each character in subtle ways that push each of their arcs. In the specific cases of Michael Keaton's Riggan and Edward Norton's Mike, they reach unforeseen climaxes that respectively mystify and shock viewers. \nRiggan, the lead, is shown to be a self-important man struggling on a quest to validify himself as a respected Broadway actor after acquiring early celebrity decades prior to the current story events for portraying an iconic comic book character. He is psychotic, hearing himself in his mind as the iconic Birdman, the character Riggan is famous for in the film. This gravelly voice antagonizes Riggan with reminders of the perceptions others have of him and of the glory he held in his younger days, which are now behind him and never fails to mock by assuring that he is always there for Riggan, even calling him brother after one intense breakdown. This cajoling often sends him on violent tantrums that see his property damaged apparently through the use of telekinesis. Now Riggan is on his last leg. He is desperate to revitalize his tattered image by bringing the genius of an obscure short story by Raymond Carver to the stage as its director and lead actor.\nRiggan is a kind enough character, quirky and earnest if not a bit self obsessed. These elements of his personality make the audience sympathetic toward him, though his quest is a personal one and not concerned with important social issues or deep philosophical quandaries. Although there is no intrinsic universality to the characters quest it's easy enough to care that he succeeds when one considers the passion and subtlety in Keaton's performance. \nI was shocked after one intense scene where Riggan's daughter, played by Emma Stone, ripped him a new one for his self imposed social detachment and his condescending attitude for the social media, which she finds so appealing. When she was done ranting she offered a hollow apology. The faux smack of sorrow written across her brow was telling. It suggested awareness that she should feel bad for what she'd said, but in actuality she wasn't concerned how her words had hurt her father. It was just the courtesy drawn from social convention that birthed her apology and did not express real compassion. \nThe very real load of anxiety written across Riggan's brow told a story of being put in one's place whether he liked it or not. The painful truth exposed in this exchange lingered in silence as he gave no response to her apology, so when he lit and smoked the short marijuana joint of her's he'd found hidden in a peanut butter jar, the same joint, which had started the tense encounter, I felt resonance in his need for the near instant relief that doobie drag gave him, despite the hypocrisy in his actions. \nLife can be that way sometimes and that sentiment was frozen in a snapshot in this scene. It made me wish for my own instant relief as the scene was tense and thrilling, but not in a bomb explosion/car chase way, rather in the gritty slice of life way this film nails so often. Kudos to Stone for the visceral intensity she delivered in this scene and to Keaton for his response, which conveyed a stayed apathy that worked in tandem to cement a perfect moment in film history and in the cognition of the audience.\nMike (Edward Norton) was grim and cynical and obsessed of a unique type of narcissism, which expressed itself in his convoluted pathology toward the dichotomy of truth and illusions. A talented and known stage performer, Mike's entire life was the stage. This was shown clearly when, after receiving a supporting part on Broadway on short notice, he arrived, proved himself worthy, than stripped naked for a fitting, in front of Riggan's daughter, with a just-another-day-at-the-office attitude. \nMike was a character that believed that only what he did on stage was truth, so the way he behaved off stage and the reactions and opinions that behavior generated were of no consequence to him.  To Mike the stage was a holy altar where the right and ritual of truth was practiced and to do anything else was sacrilege. His characterization as a snarky, detached, manipulative jerk felt rushed early in the film, but it soon became clear why Mike needed to be characterized so quickly. \nHis character arc climaxed promptly in a scene where he nearly raped his offstage girlfriend, Lesley portrayed by Naomi Watts, who was also his love interest in the Broadway show, before the 150-member audience in attendance. It was clear that he was a do-anything-for-the-part actor to the extreme and his rushed portrayal as a pathological maniac was necessary for this scene to be believable. \nHis given excuse for trying to copulate on stage with Lesley was in order to give the audience truth in acting. This pathology was elaborated after the scene ended, backstage when Lesley suggested that Mike hadn't been able to get it up for six months and now before 150 people he was hard as a rock, to which he replied, \"I need it to be real.\" His reality was constructed of the complex emotions he dealt with on stage before the audience, and life for Mike was merely what happened between performances. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Innarritu, the screenwriters and Norton himself, expertly handled the mix of showing and telling in characterizing Mike.\nThe cinematography in this film was a call back to a time when frenzied cuts didn't exist. The long shots flowed from one scene to the next like a live performance caught on tape. This gave a stage play-like feel to the film. It was tiring one moment and refreshing the next and added to the quirk built in to this story. The extended shots of halls, some smoke filled, accompanied by audience applauding or sonorous horn music served as transitions between acts and added an art house feel to the movie's aesthetics; and were all tasteful choices I might add. \nThe music can't be over looked in this film. It was nuanced and sparse, but heavy when played and drew the audience instantly into the world of the characters. One notable example of this affect was when Mike and Sam, Stone's character, were on the cusp of lovemaking, backstage hidden in a cove of ropes and shadows. The music sprung into the frame, a close shot of the two actor's faces, their lips just inches apart. \nThis music conveyed reverie and optimism and all the virtues of ignorance that the movie tried to portray. And as Mike laid her down, Sam's smile enveloped the rich bliss that only ignorance can offer. Wisdom is full of sorrows and none of these characters are wise, but what they lack in wisdom they more than make up for in the experiences of real living. \nThey are all plunged into the real emotions of life and love and jealousy and unfulfilled desire, but somehow blind to the intellectual baggage that living has built into their lives. While wading through this bog of emotions, the type personal reflection that give one insightful comprehension and helps to forge a fully constructed view of one's self are lost on these characters. This is the realm of ignorance that director, Inarritu is subtly tapping, which brings us to the conversation of powerful emotions in this film.\nPowerful emotions pervade this story. They often draw on the audience in shocking ways and sometimes act as camouflage to cover the lack of plot development in the movie. This film stands in a long tradition of the emotional development, which is touted here above plot development as the narrative meanders, dawdling through the sentimental gestures of the main characters and leads to no conclusions. \nThe main characters embark on a spiritual journey that climbs toward an inner climax. It is not a high point in dramatic action, this climax, but a moment of truth or clarity, which shapes the characters' lives after the apex event. In this film the highest emotional arc is dispensed on Riggan when, on the night before the big opening, he verbally attacks the Broadway critic who wields the power to murder his play on the tip of her pen. \nThe two characters go at each other's throats firing unveiled hostilities that center on their respective identities. Riggan implies that the critic must have suffered artistic blight to become the woman who sacrificed nothing to tear down the dreams of others. He posits himself an actor who has sacrificed everything for his work. She draws a distinction, which is the crux of Riggan's whole emotional journey by clarifying that he is a celebrity, not an actor. She tells him she will kill his play solely because of what he represents, which is in her words the cartoonish and pornographic portrayals of Hollywood's conception of acting. She tells him that his life is measured in weekend box office takes, reiterating the idea that his existence is not valid. \nThe ensuing emotional low brings Riggan to that moment of clarity where on stage, during his opening night when that most important critic is in attendance in the second row during the play's climax Riggan says that he is nothing, that he is no one and wields a loaded pistol. It is a real pistol and despite the fact that the audience doesn't know this he fires on himself apparently ending a tragic and shallow existence. An existence consumed by his obsession with acting and proving himself valid in the eyes of the critics and the audience. His quest for validity seems to end once he's finally accepted the fact that Riggan is not valid. Then the camera cuts to black. \nIn the next scene we see Riggan's wife in a hospital room and eventually learn that he miss fired, shooting off his nose, not killing himself as we are led to believe. In his recovery room Riggan learns from a news report that he has finally regained the status he'd desired as his fans hold prayer vigils and lay flowers for him while he convalesces. After this we are given an ambiguous denouement that ends the plot with a question, not a conclusion. The overall emotional effect inspires hope and cheer and leaves the audience on an upswing alleviating all the anxiety experienced through out the film with comedic panache while tying up no loose ends.\nThe quirk of Riggan as a delusional celebrity who's sees and hears things that aren't there when experiencing anxiety, and who may or may not have the ability to levitate, are this movie's charm and offer emotional breaks that are much needed as this black comedy is quite intense. On the whole watching this character study was an enjoyable experience. And I definitely suggest you see this film.",

            "content": "Review by Jesse Burleson of VIEWS ON FILM\n\n\nMichael Keaton has been appearing in movies every since he burst onto the scene doing the fast-talking, kooky, morgue worker thing in 1982's Night Shift. Since then, he's been in mostly semi-memorable comedies, a couple of stints in two Batman films, and forgettable duds like 1998's Jack Frost, 2005's White Noise, and Herbie: Fully Loaded (oy vey). Watching 2014's Birdman made me wonder why it took so long for him to I don't know, star in anything Academy Award worthy. He's always had the ability to someday be nominated for an Oscar. Director Alejandro G. Inarritu's latest is a raw, unflinching, bracingly original play on words and for what it's worth, might just punch Keaton's thirty-two year wait of a ticket. As an acting showcase, this \"bird\" is definitely the word as quiet as it's kept.\n\nFilmed primarily in and around one location (NYC's St. James Theatre), edited brilliantly by Douglas Crise (Spring Breakers) and Stephen Mirrione (George Clooney's The Monuments Men), and featuring a lot of male characters fighting/running around in their underwear, Birdman immediately hones in on a washed up actor named Riggan Thomson (Michael \"my real last name is Douglas\" Keaton). Thomson hasn't been in much of anything lately whether it be Broadway or Hollywood fodder. His one salvation: direct, write, and star in a play adapting Raymond Carver's (a real-life, famous writer) short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". As the proceedings move along, you don't get the feeling that you're gonna see many acts in said stage production (within a movie). It's more about the behind-the-scenes stuff that is conflicted with multiple actor egos, creative differences, actual fist fighting among the cast members, daughter/father resolutions, and attempted, co-star rape (very mild and only in one short scene).\n\nMichael Keaton's performance, which if you haven't already heard, is the high point. It has a nasty, kick-in-the-door intensity to it. Is his Riggan Thomson on drugs? Is he a chronic alcoholic? Or schizophrenic? Does he have an imaginary friend in alter ego \"Birdman\" (his superhero character popularized in movies over two decades ago)? Finally, can he actually move objects with his brain? And can he fly (you know I'm kidding, right)? It doesn't matter. Keaton's Thomson probably possesses a lot of these things and he plays him with a visibly weathered, unassuming style. You can't quite see the wheels turning in Beetlejuice's head. That's the brilliance you get from a veteran screen icon who seems hellbent on literally acting his testicles off. The rest of the cast, well they fade in and out and still kill it at the same time. Edward Norton is despicably good as Thomson's belligerent acting rival. Emma Stone, with her gigantic, glaring eyeballs, emotes wonderfully in a couple of scenes as Keaton's character's druggie daughter. Zach Galifianakis is unexpectedly brilliant playing Thomson's hopped-up best friend/lawyer (this is quite a diversion from his Hangover doofus) and Amy Ryan, well she's a soft revelation playing I guess, Thomson's intolerant ex-wife.\n\nThen there's Inarritu's knockout direction which has to be seen to be believed. He's a filmmaker who doesn't fly by the rules and gets away with things every time. Remember in 2003's 21 Grams when he filmed every scene out of order (like a bunch of puzzle pieces) only to put them neatly back together in the end? I do. This guy's out of bounds but in a good way. With Birdman (his 5th feature), he fumbles a bit with his confusing storyline only to shoot some of the most elaborate tracking shot sequences this side of Goodfellas and Boogie Nights. You drop your jaw in amazement as to how many marks the actors had to hit, how many takes their endless shots might have possessed, how many hundreds of lines of dialogue they had to memorize, and when in said shots, did Inarritu actually yell \"cut\" (it's conceivable that the first hour or so might have been one long tracking bonanza. That can't be right, can it?).\n\nIn retrospect, Birdman is set to a film score that is mostly fused with solo, jazz-inspired drumming. It's a fall release posing as part hallucinatory dream, part suicidal character study, and part frigid, black comedy. Watching it made me think that what's on screen might be too radical for title as best vehicle of 2014. It could however, get a shot in the category of Best Picture nods come January. Only time will tell. Anyway, as a celebratory Steadicam feast that makes you think, \"how the heck did they film that?\", Birdman is Keaton's finest hour and for my money, truly a top \"feeder\" (ha-ha).",

Unfortunately, whatever its merits, may be, they seem to have been largely lost on me, as I was left feeling a combination of disappointed, bored, and dizzy (due to the camera work).  It's made me question whether my tastes may in fact be more pedestrian than I like to imagine, at least when it comes to art films.  The acting was good - if anything, I felt frustrated that most of the characters weren't really allowed to develop, and some aspects of the plot seemed to just fizzle out or disappear inexplicably.  My difficulty with the disjointed narrative didn't make me question my own intelligence or open-mindedness (let alone deeper philosophical questions) so much as it made me question what the filmmakers were really hoping people would take away from this.  Because what I took away was mainly a headache.  If I had been wearing a watch, I would have started checking it long before the ending.  My feelings were similar to those I experienced after films such as \"Synecdoche, New York\", or the less accessible works of P.T. Anderson, David Lynch or Michel Gondry.

All of the performances are really great, so much so that you can't really solo out any performer as being better than the other. I know it's natural to choose Keaton, but he gets more to do than many of the others, as well.\n\nI really enjoyed this film, and I think it's one that you need to see in a theater or if you see it at home, be a captive audience. Commit to it. Don't have your laptop or your tablet out, commit to watching the entire film. Because Inarritu's idiosyncrasies can make the film feel too weird and too tedious to keep up with, but by the second act, you'll be with his rhythm. And Birdman will be rewarding.\n\nNot that all of the film works, but as a technical achievement, it's phenomenal. Not just in terms of filmmaking, but in the performances as well. Everyone feels real, and Inarritu really works every part of the story. There are some of the hallucination scenes that didn't all work for me, but over all I was really invested in the characters.

No story, just a bleak. dirty look at life with everyone on the wrong track.  The Alien hates this world and leaves it, leaving all his s**t behind.

            "content": "Birdman is smashing, just smashing. Director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Babel and Biutiful) leaps into creative mode with this juicy, ambitious, powerhouse story, Birdman. \n\nGoing into Birdman I had no idea what to expect from this film, but coming out of the theater I couldn't help but keep an enormous grin on my face. So let me break it down to you in several parts to show you how memorizing this film really is. The first part is the star stunning performances of Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Amy Ryan, and Andrea Riseborough.  All performed to the fullest extent of perfection. Birdman is a Broadway satire and black comedy all in one, hint its subtitle: An Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance. \n\nRiggan Thomson (Keaton) is a washed up actor who has fallen into hard times since he stopped playing his iconic superhero, Birdman, sum 20 years ago. Sound familiar? I thought so, this film actually parallels right with Keaton's real life when he played the Caped Crusader in Tim Burton's Batman sum 20 years ago.  With two Batman films under his belt Keaton stopped and tried to move on to something else, but nothing came. The same goes for Riggan, after completing the Birdman trilogy Riggan called it quits to move on to bigger and better things, but still nothing came. \n\nKeaton knows what it is like to be in a slum in the acting business, while also trying to move on from those damn tights in the past. Riggan is trying to get back on track with his acting career and makes a gusty call by writing, directing and starring in his own Broadway debut of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. His inspiration of the play and becoming an actor was influenced by none other than Carver himself. Riggan states that Carver apparently caught him, as a youngin, on the stage years back and wrote \"Thank you for an honest performance. Raymond Carver\" on a cocktail napkin. Keaton goes all out in his tour de force performance in this film. \n\n Which leads us to the rest of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's stellar cast. There's Norton who gives us an award-worthy achievement as Mike Shiner, a Broadway actor whose ego is as big as his talent. With his mocks of mainstream media he drives Riggan off the wall and when the two clash it's hilarious. Stone plays Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering junkie. Stone is raw and vibrant as the daughter who was over shadowed by her dad's acting past and tells him he doesn't exist anymore because he didn't adapt to the viral world. Galifianakis breaks out of his comedic form to a more dignified role as Riggan's loyal producer. Next, there's Watts and Riseborough who are both trying to shine as young actresses, but Riseborough is a little distracted because she's too busy screwing Riggan. Finally, there's Ryan, Riggan's ex-wife, who's trying to bring balance to her family and a self-doubtful man whom she still cares about. \n\nThe second part is on a technical scale because Birdman blows every film out of the water this year. This film was shot too look like one meandering continuous take. This technical showcase was executed brilliantly by camera genius Emmanuel Lubezki (Oscar winner for Gravity). This aspect in the film, of course, is a major key to its glorious success. We follow all of the characters continuously throughout the film as their stories unfold right before our very eyes. The film smoothly veers from Riggan's reality to his imagination and back again with no breaks ... it's breathtaking to watch on screen. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu throws us into the mist of Riggan's craziness all throughout the film. One minute we are levitating off the ground too performing a play on stage too flying high above Manhattan. All of these illusion's are pouring right out of Riggan's head and blooming perfectly on screen. \n\nThe third part of this film that amazed me was its layered storytelling. Keaton's narration is spot on and gives the film a since of ooh and aah. From the moment Keaton brings out his Birdman voice you're hooked. Birdman gives Riggan hell and continues to stress him out until he gets to the point of a nervous breakdown in the film. Is he mad? A narcissist? A lunatic? Or just an actor? Either way, Keaton is potent and gives his best performance of his career. I'm smelling Oscar bait right here. The forth part that made this film vibe is the music. There's nothing but powerful drumming throughout the film, which drives Birdman to not fly but soar. Drummer Antonio S\u00e1nchez gave us a lively and upbeat soundtrack that jazzed me up. \n\nLastly, this all couldn't have been done without the mind power behind the camera and that's I\u00f1\u00e1rritu himself. This bold and beautifully captured film shows the human side of actors and their fight for survival on and off the stage. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu didn't just create a film; he created a high and flying masterpiece that is sure to get lots of Oscar love this February. Birdman is a creatively risky work of art painted right on screen. Birdman is solidly performed, shot and executed from beginning until end. Plus there's tons of laugh out loud moments evenly placed throughout. You'll laugh until your sides hurt. It's one of my favorite films of the year and receives the highest of highs ... five out of five stars. This is a film that will be talked about for years to follow. So brace yourself and buy a ticket now.",

That this film not only succeeds at this, but triumphs, is just one of the reasons for its extraordinariness. Phenomenally performed by a cast at the top of their games (Michael Keaton achieves near-brilliance, and Edward Norton and Emma Stone in particular are phenomenal) and shot in a simulated-one-take that trumps \"Goodfellas\" and even Hitchcock's \"Rope,\" the film is endlessly inventive in its exploration of an actor on the verge of a nervous breakdown. It is merciless in its ridicule of all aspects of the entertainment industry, even going so far as to take jabs at itself.

The film also feels like a play, which itself is about a make or break new Broadway play.  That's quite interesting too.  The film follows former action star (of the superhero Birdman series, played by Michael Keaton) who's trying to make a comeback as  a real actor.  He's on the verge of a mental breakdown.  There's a lot of tension, the actors are great, the dialogue is sharp and the direction takes chances.  I felt an edge-of-the-seat excitement as to what to expect next.

Thought-provoking and unsettling, the film deals with questions surrounding the need for validation or admiration from others, the significance of individuals, and the strive to make a meaningful existence. Another stand-out aspect was a particular monologue from Emma Stone, which was explosive and impacting. Finally, the repetitive score was haunting, marking a sense of urgency or madness that led to the film's final moments.",

From the quick little comedic bits of Zach Galifianakis's hilarious supporting role to the believable daughter role created ever-so-brilliantly by Emma Stone, this film delivers the perfect amount of comedy, drama, action, and even tragedy. But the true highlights of this film are from the two leading men, Michael Keaton and Edward Norton. Norton creates a character that the audience just loves to hate, and then loves to love at the end. A supporting actor nomination and even win are VERY likely for him. As for Keaton, I have never seen an actor as dedicated or believable as he in this film. He truly comes to life in this film and in my mind, deserves the Oscar right now...why wait till Spring?! There are plenty of films about \"washed up actors\" or \"wannabe stars,\" but Keaton takes it to the next level, bringing tears, laughs, and emotion to the audience in the most believable way. Believability, in my mind, is vital, and Keaton nails it to the bone. Aside from the acting, the cinematography that Birdman offers, as well as the (less than) five minutes of special effects, are truly breathtaking. For those of you who don't know, the entire film is done in ONE take, even transitioning from night to day, without cutting the camera ONCE. Seeing the camera seamlessly transition between scenes makes the whole thing seem real and like you're literally walking through the hallways and backstage of the St. James theatre. Everything about the writing, cinematography, and acting, make Birdman a must see, and create a LEGEND out of Michael Keaton. Watch out for this film come Oscar time, for you'll see it on the list in MANY places.",

Michael Keaton delivers the performance of a lifetime, with great interaction from a spot on cast, particulary Edward Norton and Emma Stone.",

            "content": "Let me gush up front. I loved this movie. I don't want say too much so I'll do my best to give an enthusiastic recommendation without spoilers.\n\nWritten by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (who also directed), Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo, Birdman is one of the best movies I've seen all year. Warning, you do need an attention span and your forebrain to fully appreciate it. Critics who called this a fiasco or godawful mess need a check up from the neck up.\n\nIt stars Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. This is truly an ensemble cast with a 5? intense, complex, layered, tortured performance by Keaton as Riggan Thompson who was the titular character in several blockbuster action movies back in the day. I was particularly impressed by the subdued, leveled acting accomplishment delivered by Galifianakis. His almost unrecognizable presence reminded me of how Philip Seymore Hoffman would have done it given the chance. I hope he gets more roles like this.\n\nThe film flows in real time and is beautifully edited to invite viewers into the room as a participant. Up close shots and intimate angles gave me the feeling that I was part of character's conversations...even the ones in their heads.\n\nThe cinematography and set design brought me into the claustrophobic banality of an actor's life backstage in the narrows of labyrinth hallways, cramped dressing rooms, and dark interconnect stairways doubling as access and refuge.\n\nI've commented in recent posts like Gone Girl and Listen Up Philip on how poorly the disembodied voiceover is used in movies. More annoying and distracting than informative or useful. In this case it really worked as Riggan questions his abilities, reality and the world around him folding in while he tries to break free from the restraints of recognition. Both his own inner voice and that of the imagined superhero Birdman, bully, coach, haunt, mock, taunt and confuse him as he searches for validity as a performer, maybe even as a man.... via writing, directing and acting in a Broadway play about love. He's desparate for authenticity in a world of make believe littered with broken relationships and regret. Yet he struggles through, driven by conviction.\n\nThe tense power dynamic between stage and screen principle actors, supporting performers and the behind the scenes crew who have to nurture their fragile egos, and critics, is crackling good.\n\nThe thing for me that works about this film is the vulnerability each character shares. Beneath obvious talent and disagreeable exteriors they are believably flawed, and scared so it made me care about what happened to them.\n\nIronically, we all know Keaton played Batman back in the day. He looks like an actor who once had 'that career'. The competition between him and the younger Norton (playing the 'real' Broadway leading man the play needs for gravitas) is a scab that is always being picked.\n\nAt one point the story reminded me of Top 5, a brilliant comedy by Chris Rock I saw at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. In both cases, the main characters struggle to shake off previous acting roles by taking a daring risk in their careers. Rock has a muse in Top 5 but Keaton only has voices battling in his head. Both films are darkly funny with great dialogue. But Birdman has some touches of fantasy that break the momentum with questions best left unanswered (you'll understand when you see it).\n\nBirdman is a Phoenix for both Keaton and my movie going experience. Do yourself a favor, and go.\nwww.particularpelicula.wordpress.com",

The fact that its shot and edited to look like one single long take for most of it, does add a new layer of depth to it. Taking that away would have lessened the film a bit. Yet, the story and acting are fantastic on their own, so the adding of the cinematic style is a plus but not necessary. \n\nThat's what you must keep in mind when you film a movie with a 'gimmick.' It must work outside of said 'gimmick.' Blair Witch works outside of the found footage angle, Pulp Fiction mostly works outside of being out on chronological sync (for the most part), and Birdman works without the long take aspect.

I would rank this somewhere close to the top five films I have personally ever seen, so before you read my in-depth and SPOILER-filled review I would recommend seeing this masterpiece of a film, it is truly cinematic perfection. \n\nOn to the review, this movie by Alejandro Inarritu is amazing. Under the genre \"black comedy\" it takes advantage of poking fun at things other movies won't like murder, sex, racism and other touchy topics. This is what separates this movie apart from others in terms of comedic taste and substance. \n\nThe actors in this movie are plenty: Micheal Keaton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifanakis and the man who stole the show: Edward Norton. Everyone did a suburb job, and they had to, but I will touch on that in a second. Keaton had an exceptional performance as a washed up actor living out his dreams as a Broadway director, writer and actor and then on top of that being a father to a recovering drug addict (Emma Stone). Emma Stone is amazing as well, her body is more slim than her other roles and she fits the part well and adjusted accordingly to play her part as a drug addict. Her monologues with Edward Norton are amazing and hold true value and meaning to them. Now to being on Mr. Norton. God is this man funny. Norton stole the show with his amazing performance and his comedic timing, i don't know if it was a good script or his improvisation was just on point for this film but damn, he was amazing throughout. \n\nNow for the most astonishing point of the movie: it was filmed in \"one-shot\" takes. The first hour of the movie is one shot. No cuts, no editing the order, one long shot without these actors messing up. It is amazing what Mr. Inarritu did with this and it was so fun to watch as the camera panned around to add new characters in the scene and to remove them, to show the passing of time and other things that a movie would normally cut to. IT was visually pleasing and so much fun to watch as i stated earlier. \n\nTo end, I will be seeing it again in the near future. It will be an instant download and a movie I will watch, and laugh at for years to come. A 5/5 from me, its beautiful film making and I hope to see more of Mr. Inarritu's work soon.",

Is this films as good as most critics say it is?   \n Riggan Thompson is a washed-up Hollywood actor who once played the superhero Birdman but twenty years later Riggan\u00b4s career has been almost eradicated. Decided to reinvent his career, Riggan decides to take Raymond Craver\u00b4s short story \"What We Talk about When We Talk about Love\" and make it a Broadway play with him as writer, director and protagonist. Soon the making of this play becomes a complete disaster thus breaking Riggan\u00b4s sanity and putting his reputation at the edge of oblivion. \nMy fellow countryman Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1arritu surprised audiences with his directorial debut \"Amores Perros\" and its follow-up \"21 Grams\" but his other two films were of lower quality but \"Birdman\" managed to return to his early career quality of filmmaking. The first that needs to be said about \"Birdman\" is that is not your typical superhero film, it's an expertly made and engaging drama which satirizes modern franchises and the superhero genre in general. \"Birdman\" counts amazing performances by every single actor of this huge cast with the best being, of course Michael Keaton in a Academy Award caliber performance, which has Keaton using both of his over the top comedic persona and his dramatic acting, followed by Naomi Watts, Edward Norton and Emma Stone; it has a simple but energetic and memorable score, a well written script, hilarious dialog which is surprising considering I\u00f1arritu\u00b4s reputation, spot on references, an engaging story, great characters, intriguing character relationships, perfect pacing, beautiful cinematography, a masterfully made mixture of various genres (comedy, drama, satire, \"superhero\", etc.),  jaw dropping directing, it encapsulates the way theatre works, an expertly executed criticism at today's standers of filmmaking and one of the best filming and editing styles I\u00b4ve ever seen, the whole film feels like it was shot as one long tracking shot.\n\"Birdman\" is a film that has everything a great film needs, it's pure cinematic magic and one of the best, if not the best, film of 2014 (my favorite so far and one of the best films I seen in the last few years). I hope the 2015 Academy Awards give \"Birdman\" the credit it deserves. A must see film!",

            "content": "You know, for me setting out to see a particular movie, I stay away from reading extensive synopsis, and critical reviews; as they often over-hype the experience of seeing a movie. I like to instead, employ The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance and avoid disappointing expectations. That was a good call today; key to enjoying a spectacular film: BIRDMAN. \n\nSo I sat down and reclined the plush new theater lounge chair, anticipating a lite-hearted story of a washed up superhero and his attempted return to fame. Instead I was transfixed by a seemingly, seamless portrayal of an actor, artist, father, businessman and his world class cast of characters in an amazing satire on showbiz, pop culture, and distorted social trends and internal conflict. I found the film to be a wonderful visit to a poet's surreal sense of artistic integrity vs temptations and anxiety in the quest for fame and fortune; honest brutal truth, reality affecting ego and drive. So, I'm not going to fill YOU in on the storyline, but I will suggest you go in knowing you are about to really love this film or possibly hate it.\n\nDirector Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Cinematographer Emmanulel Lubezki , have combined talents to produce not only a Biutiful film, but also one with haunting and significant Gravity. Together, director, cinematographer, and an amazingly inventive cast that shines with individual excellence as they each get a shot at Oscar worthy performances support a visual and enlightening work of achievement that may well be controversial on awards night. I'm curious how Hollywood and stage entities may embrace the solid, groundbreaking efforts here.  \nYou HAVE to see this film if not simply for the talents of Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Amy Ryan, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, and in my opinion the greatest effort I've ever seen from Emma Stone- WATCH FOR THAT.\n\nTechnical accolades are warranted here too.....A freeform percussive soundtrack drove emotional waves, a slithery camera revealed intimate coverage of the theatrical environment as it often went with long continuous takes. Soft fades and minimal edits were utilized to join surreal ideas with conscious thought; time transition from night into day and back, all drawn and conveyed upon a fine line between reality and illusion allowed the audience to see our own inner Birdman. \n\nI suggest that anyone who loves seeing good films take a chance... Birdman (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) should not be missed.",

            "content": "Every daring, hilarious, biting, dazzling frame of Birdman is pure movie heaven. Like all films that are allergic to Hollywood bullshit, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's cinematic tour de force will bring out those who just don't get it. Screw them. Birdman is bursting through the screen with ideas. You won't know what the fuck hit you.\n\nOn the surface, Birdman seems like just a hard-hitting satire of showbiz, but it's only that in the sense that The Dark Knight was just a comic book movie. This is a film centered on art and the act, or at least attempt, at reinvention. Michael Keaton, in an electrifying, volcanic performance is Riggan Thomson, a washed up actor fallen on hard times since he was once on top of the world playing the title superhero in the Birdman trilogy of films that made billions. Sound familiar? Keaton himself of course starred in two acclaimed turns as the Caped Crusader himself in Tim Burton's Batman film, so he knows exactly from what he's acting. Riggan sees his way back into relevance by making his Broaadway debut writing, directing and starring in a stage adaptation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. It seems Carver saw young Riggan onstage many years ago in which the author sent him a note on a cocktail napkin that read 'Thank you for an honest performance. Ray Carver.'\n\nSo that has Riggan trying like hell to be honest on the tightrope of Broadway, where sharp-eyed critics are all too eager to rip movie stars to shreds. It's not all that new in terms of premise but as filtered through the keen eye of this Mexican filmmaking visionary (see Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful) and his co-screenwriters Nicholas Giacobone. Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo, everything feels bracingly fresh. As the film's subtitle, The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, huge blunders can be total freedom and bliss.\n\nOne of the strengths of Birdman lies in its visuals, amazingly executed by camera wizard  Emmanuel Lubezki, an Oscar winner for last year's Gravity, to create the illusions that the film is unfolding in one sinuous take. Lubezki's work is stellar, particularly for the way it skillfully allows the film to swing from reality and back again seamlessly so that when Riggan flies above Manhattan and fire balls of flame for his fingers we are also living in his head. Hell the first time we see Riggan he's levitating in his dressing room,listening to the voice of Birdman (Keaton himself in a lower register) who insists he's way too good for these theatre pricks.\n\nThat leads to the rest of the cast who all bring their A-games and stress Riggan out as he goes back and forth between narcissism and self-loathing. Zach Galifianakis is outstanding as Riggan's harried lawyer and producer. Naomi Watts is excellent as one of Riggans co-stars, as is Andrea Riseborough as the actress Riggan is getting it on with and Amy Ryan as the ex-wife trying not to see a conflicted man fall deeper into turmoil.\n\nKeaton himself delivers his greatest performance yet, but there's also much to be said of Edward Norton as a volatile, immature Method actor whose talent is as large as his ego. Not to mention a never-better Emma Stone who is just great as Riggan's embittered daughter fresh out of rehab and looking to get Dad hooked on social media where quality is measured by how many 'Likes' you get than anything else.\n\nAbove all, Birdman, a dark comedy of desperation bouyed by Inarritu's humanism and optimism, is damn funny and a portrait of someone fallibly human. Birdman is a rollercoaster, pure exhilaration. No one who loves film would miss it.",

Birdman from director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu best known for 21 Grams (2003), Babel (2006), and the absolutely stunning Biutiful (2010) brings about a dark comedy that holds its own, but ultimately will not be for everyone. The film in a nut shell is about an actor named Riggan (Michael Keaton) who is adating a novel into a broadway play. Many people think he is a washup and doesn't belong in the theater light because of his past success playing the superhero Birdman. He constantly is breaking down and having his own little crisis going on. The voice of the Birdman keeps telling him what he wants. His agent Jake (Zach Galifianakis) tried to keep him jovial and on he right path, but his two co-stars Mike (Edward Norton who is basically playing a parody of himself since he's known to be difficult to work with) and Lesley (Naomi Watts) are making it ever so difficult. Add to the mix his fresh out of rehab daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is around and constantly a reminder to Riggan about how terrible a father he was. The film is downright an entertaining flick, but many people may think its a bit slow. There's a lot of dialogue (to the point where the film looks like its shot in one long take, so actors had to ham out a lot of dialogue to keep it going). The story has so many allegories and meanings to it that its up to the viewer to decipher them all. What does it all mean and whats the significance of the Birdman? Great way to almost incorporate Keaton's own fame as Batman into the story. Keaton by the way is absolutely brilliant in his role and worth the ticket price alone.

I certainly don't think it's one of the best movies of 2014.\n\nThat being said, this movie was really enjoyable, and really strange. Of course, there's the amazing way it looks like the movie is all (pretty much) one shot, and I'm a sucker for cool cinematography like that. I love that most of the movie takes place in the same claustrophobic set, the various rooms of the theater. Thanks to the cinematography and overall tone, the movie has an immediacy and excitement to it, which also lends it tension going into the performance scenes.\n\nThere are lots of great individual scenes, including pretty much any scene with Edward Norton. Emma Stone's performance was also pretty great, especially in that monologue she shouts at Riggan. Oddly, maybe my lack of extreme enthusiasm for the movie was that I enjoyed the scenes with Edward Norton or Emma Stone or much of the rest of the supporting cast more than the scenes with Riggan himself. I liked Riggan's arc, and it certainly comes to a thrilling conclusion, but I more personally connected to and was interested by Mike's ability to be himself on the stage - and his inability to do it off the stage.\n\nThere were only two scenes I was iffy about. The first was when Birdman actually takes a physical form and appears next to him, and he begins to fly around New York. It was cool visually, and I'm sure most people would consider that one of the most important/stunning scenes of the movie, but for whatever reason it made me kind of roll my eyes, though I won't deny the over-the-top visual effects as he unleashed his powers and imagination were both awesome and hilarious. The other scene was the one where he skewers the critic, Tabitha. I liked some parts of it; Tabitha obviously deserves it, because she seems like a genuinely bad critic, especially considering she'll write a bad review just because she doesn't like the type of person Riggan is. But that's the thing, I think - Tabitha's problem is that she's a bad person and bad critic, not that she IS a critic. Riggan denouncing criticism altogether was a tad annoying in the same way that Jon Favreau's character was irritating when he did it in Chef. Just because he's the one that creates the art doesn't mean that it's noble to try to dissect it or explain its virtues/failings to audiences.\n\nAltogether, though, this was a really fun movie to watch, with lots of great visuals (so many wide-angle shots) and a really great atmosphere to spend some time in. I definitely want to watch it again, or maybe even just read the script.",

It's very much a type of old school stage comedy where you'd follow a conversion through a door, and another one would start from out of another door.  The camera-work and angles were fantastic.  Shot very much at eye-level or angling up, which lent energy and a great sense of perspective to the film.  The dialogue was just a tick behind Grand Budapest Hotel, which still makes it excellent.  And the acting was exceptional.  The first half of the movie was owned by Ed Norton (who I consider a top 5 actor in the business), and the second half was dominated by Michael Keaton.  Both put on one of their best performances of their respective careers.  The supporting cast was outstanding as well.  Both Emma Stone and Naomi Watts nail their parts, and their is chemistry between all the actors from scene to scene.  Even Zach Galifianakis was good - and he's not a favorite of mine.  The more I think about the ending, the more I love it.  Coming out of the theater, I wasn't sure how to interpret it - but I feel I now have the correct interpretation (at least for myself), and I love it.  I won't spoil anything, but the final scene to me isn't what it appears.  This is my only 10/10 film this year and probably in the last couple of years.  \n\nGrade = 10/10",

Furthermore, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts deliver such raw performances in a movie that blur the lines between what's real and what's not, noting how the play is a mirror image of Michael Keaton's character's life, and how the whole plot is like a mirror image of Michael Keaton's real life.

Most of the action of this dark comedy takes place in a theater, as our has-been protagonist attempts to jumpstart his career on Broadway.  But the reason I used this word is a result of the one camera focus - using one long, continuous take - and the almost improvised and organic feel to the dialogue.  The soundtrack consists mostly of restless jazz percussion and the audience gets a real feel and flavor for Manhattan (which are two things the film has in common with Whiplash).  Michael Keaton returns to a starring role as a sympathetic, humorous, and self-absorbed person.  He seems to enjoy himself and all the neuroses his character carries with him.  Honorable mentions are in order for Emma Stone, Edward Norton, and Zach Galifianakis.  There are also elements of magical realism, with flights of fancy and telekinesis showing up randomly.  How literal these moments are to be taken is up to the interpretation of the viewer and this feeds into the ambiguous, but emotionally satisfying ending.  This could well end up a best picture nominee with some nods for performances and more importantly, it is a pleasant character study unafraid to satirize the entertainment industry and artistic integrity.",

The cinematography top notch, but the story didn't live up to its potential. It felt claustrophobic, never leaving the Broadway theater, becoming much more about actors who, let's face it, get plenty enough attention for their relatively minor contribution to society, than about anything worthwhile.\n\nI usually love offbeat movies. I thought this would be one of my favorites based on the trailer and wouldn't shut up about it before I saw it, but that trailer was misleading. The trailer plays up one scene to be far more than it is in the movie. \n\nIt decent, but less than it could have been Don't believe the hype but hopefully it relaunches Michael Keaton's career, which was its purpose..",

Secondly, the acting was great! Keaton is amazing. He feels so real in this movie, like Riggan is really him. Also want to point out the role of Emma Stone and Edward Norton who were also terrific! Now for the story. The story is very strange. It delivers quite a lot of laughs, but sometimes it can be so weird and disturbing that you won't be able to help yourself but ask \"What the hell\". The way it ends is quite surreal and everything is left to the viewer's imagination. Soundtrack was fitting, and while it wasn't anything amazing, it still has a good impact on the movie's background.

(What the hell kind of a name is \"Riggan\" for a guy in his 60s who was born before parents thought it was their duty to be creative in the assignment of monikers?)\n\nThough the general public would go wild about a \"Birdman IV\", Riggan has cast aside his Hollywood roots and is attempting to write, direct, and star in a highbrow Broadway play that no one particularly wants to see.\n \nRiggan appears to have mental issues. He's regularly taunted by the voice of his Birdman alter-ego (who sounds kind of like the Simpsons character \"Duffman\") who thinks Riggan's current endeavor is beneath him. He also has either real or imagined superpowers:  we see him flying, levitating, and moving objects with his mind. \n\nThe film focuses on the several days leading up to the play's premiere. Things are not going well. Riggan's lawyer best friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis), who's producing it as a favor to him, is forced to deal with both legal issues and budget overruns. One of the actors is replaced at the last minute with the talented but temperamental Mike (Edward Norton). In addition to being difficult to work with, Mike, who's involved with one of the plays actresses, is also putting the moves on Riggan's young daughter Sam (Emma Stone), a recovering addict who works as Riggan's assistant. Riggan is also unhappily involved with one of the actresses and his ex-wife makes regular set appearances.  Adding to his stress, a NY Times theater critic has informed him that she has the power to make the play fail and she intends to do so, sight unseen, because he's a Hollywood interloper.\n\nThough it's a very inventive movie, I didn't love \"Birdman\" quite as much as everyone else seems to. Not much to fault about the film itself, more just one of those \"cup of tea\" things.  The soundtrack - one big long drum solo with occasional staccato symbol smashes - was really getting on my nerves. I'm sure it's supposed to add to the tension but I sometimes found myself focusing more on the annoying drummer than the movie itself. \n\nI also wasn't wild about the who's-bedding-whom side plots or the many frenetic backstage encounters, preferring the scenes with more substantive one-on-one dialog, especially between Riggan and Sam. But my biggest gripe, and one that I assume I share with many others, is the movie's strange ending which will quite likely leave you scratching your head for days.",

I also found this film to be different and creative. I do see why it has received the buzz this film has had and will continue, even after Oscar season ends. However, I did not see the huge hype to Emma Stone's character. Don't get me wrong I adore her and she has come a long way from \"Easy A\" to this sort of role. I had much hoped for a larger role for her in this film, though her character did play a good part. Michael keaton, who is hit and miss for me, was a definite hit for his character. Naomi Watts continues to prove she is where she belongs. I found it interesting the plot to the film. A play within a movie is always difficult to do and intertwine this with the characters and their lives, however, Alejandro did so very well. There was no stutters and flowed very well. The ending can be taken as a great ending, creative ending, or one of those \"what just happened\" thoughts. Which is why this film can't be immediately judged. One you need to sit with.

How wrong you are.\n\n\"Birdman\" (let's abbreviate, shall we?) is anything but unapproachable. It is accessible for the average audience, but odd. It delves into the nature of self-worth and insanity. It asks questions about the line between art and \"product\" and how we view them. It deals with the very nature of a man questioning himself and everything he has ever known or believed, but it never once gets high on itself. \"Birdman\" asks questions without asking, it tells a simple story with deeper intent, but remains small in scale and very, very focused. Few \"Art\" films can claim this. Focus and \"Art\" rarely seem to go together. It seems we insult the \"Artist\" when we ask to be able to connect to their creation. The ephemeral has to be good enough. You can never touch it, only view it and despair of ever knowing anything about it. It is good to see that sometimes there is a film maker who can weave the misty artful nothingness with a solidity we as viewers can shake hands with in a firmer sense.\n\nRiggan Thomas (Michael Keaton) is a washed up super-hero film star trying to regain his self-respect and the accolades of the acting community at large. This sounds familiar somehow, eh? He is financing, starring in, producing, and directing a Broadway play adapted from the works of his favorite playwright. He has a misfit cast and crew, including Ed Norton as a notoriously difficult yet brilliant actor. Again this sounds oddly familiar. Riggan has a daughter fresh out of rehab, and no one is taking him seriously as a true stage actor. His only friend is his cynical yet doggedly devoted lawyer (Zach Galifinacus playing it totally straight) who merely wants Riggan to keep it together long enough to break even financially. To top it all off, he talks to himself and has money problems. He's coming apart at the seams. Or is he becoming sane after years of self-delusion? Are his lapses the truth and the more \"normal\" moments the lie? Is he above the mere mortals surrounding him? Or is he a suicidal maniac and a drunk? A child lost inside of a man who only desperately wants to be loved? That's for you as a viewer to discover.\n\nWithout revealing any spoilers, I can safely tell you this; this is an amazing movie in the truest sense of the word. It amazed me. It may even be a masterpiece, as one of my colleagues put it. The atmosphere is thick and rich, savory like a perfect meal. There is tension, humor, tearful confession, depth, meaning, heart, insanity, abuse, love, loss, triumph, pain. I am gasping for the words to describe it. It is ingeniously scored with ambient sound and jazz drums making way for one another as the scene (and sometimes the characters themselves) deem necessary. It is ingeniously filmed, with some shots lasting upwards of fifteen minutes and the entire movie being seamlessly edited together to work as one long, continuous scene.\n\nUnfortunately, this last point seems to be all anyone can talk about as if it were some magic trick to \"ooh and ah\" and walk away from, but it is so much more than that. The technique never feels intrusive or like a gimmick at all. It instead feeds the atmosphere of a stage play and the organic nature of that medium. And that, in turn, allows us as viewers to more naturally flow into and out of the main narrative, the play within the film, and the burgeoning psychosis of the main character. When he finds himself blurring the lines between his old superhero persona, the play he's performing in, and reality itself we feel as he feels, we break as he breaks. And just as he cannot tell what is real and what is fantasy, neither can we.\n\nWithout a doubt, Michael Keaton is astonishing in the lead. Every actor in this film that has been marginalized in any way for their previous works will find justification for their craft here. Every actor and actress seems either cast according to their reputed real-life \"type\" or to the complete antithesis of audience expectation, almost as if we are to be kept in a state teetering between completely comfortable and just off balance for what is to come next. And as Keaton's Riggan seeks redemption and respect from a public that has sidelined him for one reason or another, so Keaton and his fellow actors and actresses will be redeemed by their performances here. It is fitting that Keaton play Riggan as, in the most general sense, their stories are the same. Good actors, who played super heroes, were forced into work that was beneath them afterwards because no one could see past the mask, and now they are rising from the ashes like the triumphant Phoenix, blazing into glory.\n\nThis movie was a huge risk for everyone involved.

            "content": "Daringly taking filmgoers on an ambitious flight of fancy, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's brilliantly layered, acted, and staged bit of fuss and feathers surges the boundaries of filmmaking and filmgoing forward. As subtitles go, The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance offers up a mouthful and mindful that's definitely less playful than Dr. Strangelove's How We Learned to Worrying and Love the Bomb. What results, however, proves nearly as ridiculous and engaging as Stanley Kubrick's 1964 comic masterpiece. Birdman might serve up the existential crisis of a man who may or may not be suffering a breakdown, but the film fails to provoke an ounce of sadness. Pity's another thing entirely. As funny as it is dazzling, the film keeps the audience amused as they unwittingly get whipped up into the director's imaginative frenzy. Birdman effortlessly whisks you into its intoxicating insanity because the story feels so real, the performances so true, and our own delicate bruised egos so exposed, just like characters themselves.\n\nIn this R-rated absurdist comedy, a washed-up actor known for playing an iconic superhero (Keaton) must overcome his ego and family trouble as he mounts a Broadway play in a bid to reclaim his past glory. \n\nStretching his creative wings after the mosaic patchwork dramas 21 Grams and Babel, Inarritu keeps the action flowing seemingly as one long take. The camera follows the characters walking and talking before turning to catch the next scene already in progress. In what must have taken a mind-boggling amount of preparation, the technical aspects of Inarritu's latest manner of filmmaking simply astound the viewer. Of course, it's hard to gauge how remarkable this feat is when you're marveling at the acting. Michael Keaton always demonstrates an innate gift for pulling off oft-kilter comedy, but his transformation here is absolutely hypnotic. He leads a brilliant cast likewise swept up into its exhilarating and bizarre ether.\n\nBottom line: Birdman Forever",

            "content": "Most of us remember Michael Keaton's successful string of comedies in the early 1980s that started off with \"Night Shift\" and \"Mr. Mom\". \u00a0Afterwards, he starred in Tim Burton's highly anticipated \"Batman\" in 1989. By 1992, he once again played the caped crusader in \"Batman Returns\", earning Keaton widespread acclaim. Then something happened; Keaton's movies were more \"misses\" than \"hits\" until he seemed to disappear from cinema screens overnight. Keaton's career had fallen into the category of insignificance. \u00a0He missed out on meatier roles and blockbuster box office winners. Years later, even as he found himself providing voices to successful animated films (\"Cars\", \"Toy Story 3\"), Keaton was never handed that potential Academy Award acting part or movie. Until now.\n\nKeaton's enthralling performance completely dominates this film from start to finish. As the character Riggan Thomson, Keaton plays a once famous actor still revered by his fans for his superhero movie persona Birdman\u00a0from years ago. Riggan, perhaps similar to Keaton following his Batman days, doesn't want history to only remember him for wearing the crime-fighting costume. Unwilling to reprise the Birdman\u00a0gig for a fourth movie installment, Keaton's character leaves Hollywood for the world of Broadway plays. Now, struggling to gain acceptance from critics, fans and his family, Keaton's Riggan becomes despondent. Keaton's intensity shines throughout the movie like a laser in a dark theater. \u00a0But by no means does he carry this remarkable film solely. The film's edgy behind-the-scenes look at a Broadway production reveals a combative storyline from its entire cast and crew.\n\nJust as impressive as Keaton's acting gem in this movie\u00a0is the extraordinary job two-time Academy Award nominee Edward Norton (\"Primal Fear\", 1996) does to keep the plot and film moving along effortlessly. Norton's character, Mike, is hired as a last-minute replacement actor to\u00a0co-star opposite Keaton's delusional Riggan in the Broadway play. Together, Keaton and Norton give movie audiences a volatile mix of personalities so convincingly testy that viewers will be left cringing at times and shaking their heads. Likewise, Naomi Watts (2-time Academy Award nominee) perfectly stars as the uncertain female lead in the play's production. \u00a0Rounding out the splendid cast are Zach Galifianakis (\"The Hangover\" trilogy) and Emma Stone (\"Amazing Spider-Man\").\n\n\"Birdman\" marks such a powerful, riveting masterpiece by Keaton and his co-stars, that this film should garner several Oscar nominations. It's almost certain to make the list for Best Picture while Keaton is a heavy favorite to get a nod for Best Actor. \"Birdman\" also makes a strong case for Academy Award nominations in the Best Supporting Actor (Edward Norton) and Best Directing (Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu) categories.\n\nAside from the exceptionally strong acting performances, the movie also excels in the cinematography department. Despite being filmed almost entirely within the confines of their Broadway theater, the terrific camera angles and shots deserves separate mention. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu gallantly captures the long, maze-like hallways containing the brisk-paced walk of Keaton and others in single, continuous shots. \u00a0Viewers become transfixed on the theater set itself; both the happenings in front of the stage and behind it--never missing a step with the characters. \u00a0At other times, the film holds a shot an extra few seconds for effect and audience reflection. It's that unique showcase of the film's storyline on camera, combined with brilliant leading and supporting acting, that makes \"Birdman\" one of the best films in 2014.\n\n\"Birdman\" provides Michael Keaton the opportunity to remold his film legacy. \u00a0While Keaton has attempted for years to rekindle his 1990s\u00a0popularly at the box office, fictional superhero\u00a0Riggan Thomson has refused to be typecast as Birdman--despite the insecurity that his decision costs him. \u00a0It's only fitting that Keaton's character in \"Birdman\" desires relevancy and acceptance while taking on a new direction. After all, it's the movie \"Birdman\" that stands to help return Keaton to the top of the entertainment business. And in return, look for this film to gain massive Oscar buzz come this January--thanks to the dynamic duo of Keaton and Norton.\n\nGrade: A+",

            "content": "La reinvenci\u00c3\u00b3n siempre es algo positivo, pues lleva impl\u00c3\u00adcito el salirse de la zona de confort, desechar viejos h\u00c3\u00a1bitos y mejorar las debilidades que se vienen arrastrando, adem\u00c3\u00a1s de hacer un autoan\u00c3\u00a1lisis y autocr\u00c3\u00adtica para tratar de mejorar. Eso es exactamente lo que hace Alejandro Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu en Birdman (o La Inesperada Virtud de la Ignorancia), quinto filme de una carrera que ha dividido opiniones pero que ha demostrado ser exitosa.\n\nLejano se ve ya el tiempo en que I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu fue uno de los locutores y creadores de WFM, o el encargado de la imagen corporativa de Televisa durante la d\u00c3 (C)cada de los a\u00c3\u00b1os 90, e incluso del I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu que logr\u00c3\u00b3 una de las obras fundamentales del cine mexicano del Siglo XXI, Amores Perros, la cual influy\u00c3\u00b3 en una buena cantidad de cineastas que la han querido imitar, pero sin la eficacia narrativa y t\u00c3 (C)cnica del famoso Negro.\n\nSus posteriores cintas, 21 Gramos, Babel y Biutiful, muestran a un I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu c\u00c3\u00b3modo y dominador de su narrativa (muy a lo Robert Altman, con sus historias cruzadas, mezclado con un tanto de Ripstein y su s\u00c3\u00b3rdida visi\u00c3\u00b3n del mundo), pero que a muchos les parec\u00c3\u00ada ya un tanto repetitiva. A pesar de ciertas cr\u00c3\u00adticas, el trabajo del Negro ha sido de alto calibre, sobre todo en la parte actoral, pues si algo no se le puede negar es que es un estupendo director de actores. Muestra de ello es que al menos uno de sus actores siempre ha estado nominado al Oscar, logro que muy pocos cineastas pueden presumir.\n\nM\u00c3\u00a1s all\u00c3\u00a1 de si la personalidad y el ego de I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu han impactado a la visi\u00c3\u00b3n que la cr\u00c3\u00adtica (sobre todo la malinchista cr\u00c3\u00adtica nacional) tiene sobre sus filmes, la realidad es que ha logrado, junto con Alfonso Cuar\u00c3\u00b3n y Guillermo del Toro, poner el nombre del talento mexicano muy en alto, proponiendo cosas novedosas e inventivas, que vayan m\u00c3\u00a1s all\u00c3\u00a1 de lo comercial. Y el caso de Birdman es un ejemplo perfecto, pues se trata de un filme que no est\u00c3\u00a1 basado en una franquicia exitosa, no es secuela de nada y muestra una historia poco convencional narrada de manera brillante. Pero Birdman va m\u00c3\u00a1s all\u00c3\u00a1, pues al mismo tiempo es una \u00c3\u00a1cida s\u00c3\u00a1tira-cr\u00c3\u00adtica de la fama, el ego, el poder, la celebridad instant\u00c3\u00a1nea y de la maquinaria de Hollywood que ofrece puro estilo sobre sustancia con el \u00c3\u00banico fin de generar millones de d\u00c3\u00b3lares.\n\n\nLa trama de Birdman es relativamente sencilla: un veterano actor, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), obtuvo la fama mundial dos d\u00c3 (C)cadas atr\u00c3\u00a1s por haber interpretado al superh\u00c3 (C)roe Birdman en una saga que dio tres pel\u00c3\u00adcula y que lo convirti\u00c3\u00b3 en una celebridad. Ahora, intenta regresar al mundo de la actuaci\u00c3\u00b3n montando una obra de teatro en Broadway, la cual dirige, produce y estelariza. Pero para lograrlo deber\u00c3\u00a1 contar con la ayuda de un actor respetado en el medio, Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), as\u00c3\u00ad como la de su hija y ex drogadicta Sam (Emma Stone), su actual pareja Laura (Andrea Riseborough) y el productor de la obra, Jake (Zach Galifianakis).\n\nPero no todo es miel sobre hojuelas para Riggan, pues constantemente su alter-ego, Birdman, le habla en su cabeza y lo empuja para que intente regresar a interpretar al superh\u00c3 (C)roe, ganar millones de d\u00c3\u00b3lares y ser famoso en todo el mundo. Toda similitud con lo que ocurri\u00c3\u00b3 con la carrera de Keaton, quien alcanz\u00c3\u00b3 la fama mundial hace m\u00c3\u00a1s de dos d\u00c3 (C)cadas al interpretar a Batman, en las dos primeras pel\u00c3\u00adculas sobre el superh\u00c3 (C)roe dirigidas por Tim Burton, y cuya carrera se apag\u00c3\u00b3 de alguna manera al no continuar en la misma, no es coincidencia.\n\nEl filme de I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu funciona en m\u00c3\u00a1s de un nivel y tiene varias lecturas. A nivel actoral el Negro logra la que es, sin duda, la mejor actuaci\u00c3\u00b3n de Keaton en su carrera y con la que regresa en plena forma, siendo capaz de pasar de la cordura a la locura en un instante. Conforme va pasando la historia, es palpable la locura por la que va atravesando su personaje pero sin caer en los excesos de, por ejemplo, un Beetlejuice. Keaton logra uno de esos trabajos finos, audaces y poco comunes que ya lo tienen mencionado como uno de los rivales a vencer en la pr\u00c3\u00b3xima entrega del Oscar.\n\nPero Keaton no lo logra solo, por lo que se apoya en un extraordinario trabajo del elenco, donde sobresale el talento de Edward Norton, cuyo otro trabajo de este a\u00c3\u00b1o (El Gran Hotel Budapest), recuerdan lo desperdiciado que estuvo durante un buen rato en filmes sin mucha trascendencia. Su duelo actoral con Keaton es simplemente de agasajo. De igual manera responde Emma Stone, quien tiene una secuencia brutal y demoledora para el personaje de Riggan, y quien no se inmuta ante el talento de sus compa\u00c3\u00b1eros.\n\nEn sus anteriores filmes, I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu hab\u00c3\u00ada trabajado con un estupendo fot\u00c3\u00b3grafo como Rodrigo Prieto, pero para Birdman necesitaba al mejor quiz\u00c3\u00a1 de todo el mundo: Emmanuel Lubezki. El trabajo del Chivo demuestra no s\u00c3\u00b3lo su dominio del lenguaje cinematogr\u00c3\u00a1fico, sino que simple y sencillamente se encuentra en una liga en la que quiz\u00c3\u00a1 nadie est\u00c3 (C) a su altura. El filme est\u00c3\u00a1 realizado de tal manera que parece que est\u00c3\u00a1 rodado en una sola toma, pero es tal la perfecci\u00c3\u00b3n lograda por Lubezki que no se notan los cortes. Chivo lleva aqu\u00c3\u00ad su trabajo en Gravity (por el que gan\u00c3\u00b3 el Oscar), simplemente a otro nivel: su c\u00c3\u00a1mara flota, gira, sube, baja, se mete en las entra\u00c3\u00b1as del teatro St. James (que es donde transcurre la mayor parte del filme) y las convierte en una met\u00c3\u00a1fora de los recovecos emocionales y mentales por los que atraviesa el protagonista, al mismo tiempo que se convierte en un personaje m\u00c3\u00a1s dentro de la trama, testigo en primer plano de las emociones, sue\u00c3\u00b1os, miedos y frustraciones de los actores. Si Chivo gan\u00c3\u00b3 el Oscar por Gravity, lo justo es que repita gracias a su trabajo aqu\u00c3\u00ad.\n\nPero quiz\u00c3\u00a1 el punto m\u00c3\u00a1s importante de Birdman es la deconstrucci\u00c3\u00b3n que hace no s\u00c3\u00b3lo del ego del personaje principal, sino de diversos aspectos de la fama, la celebridad, las redes sociales, la prensa de espect\u00c3\u00a1culos y todas aquellas cosas con las que I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu y su elenco han tenido que lidiar a lo largo de los a\u00c3\u00b1os. Por un lado, la escena con la prensa pretenciosa o vac\u00c3\u00ada, que por igual peca de sabelotodo al citar un texto de Roland Barthes o que le pregunta a Riggan si es verdad que utiliza semen de cerdos beb\u00c3 (C)s para mantener el aspecto juvenil; o la cr\u00c3\u00adtica despiadada -representada por la cr\u00c3\u00adtica teatral del New York Times y que amenaza con destruir la obra y carrera de Riggan (\u00e2\u00c2\u00bfQu\u00c3 (C) tuvo que ocurrirle en la vida a alguien para convertirse en cr\u00c3\u00adtico?\u00e2?, le espeta Riggan en respuesta).\n\nOtro cr\u00c3\u00adtica va dirigida a las redes sociales y la fama instant\u00c3\u00a1nea -y ef\u00c3\u00admera- que generan de cualquier individuo que aparezca en YouTube, por ejemplo. \u00e2Odias a los blogueros, tienes miedo de Twitter y ni siquiera tienes p\u00c3\u00a1gina de Facebook. No existes\u00e2?, le receta su hija a Riggan, quien despu\u00c3 (C)s se vuelve una celebridad no por su trabajo, sino por el video en YouTube que alguien grab\u00c3\u00b3 y en el que aparece caminando en ropa interior en pleno Times Square, en una de las escenas m\u00c3\u00a1s hilarantes del filme. O el significado -y las inseguridades- de ser una celebridad: \u00e2\u00c2\u00bfPor qu\u00c3 (C) tengo tan poca autoestima?\u00e2?, pregunta en un momento el personaje de Watts. La respuesta es contundente: \u00e2Eres una actriz\u00e2?. \u00e2T\u00c3\u00ba no eres un actor, eres una celebridad\u00e2?, o \u00e2la popularidad es la prima prostituta del prestigio\u00e2?, son s\u00c3\u00b3lo algunas de las frases con las que I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu y compa\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00ada se mofan no s\u00c3\u00b3lo de una maquinaria poderosa, sino incluso de ellos mismos.\n\n\u00e2El otro d\u00c3\u00ada so\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3 (C) que estaba en un avi\u00c3\u00b3n con George Clooney y hubo un accidente. El \u00c3\u00banico que sali\u00c3\u00b3 en las noticias fue Clooney, y todo por esa barbilla\u00e2?, comenta en un momento el personaje de Keaton, cuyo alter ego quien tambi\u00c3 (C)n la agarra contra celebridades actuales, como Robert Downey Jr.: \u00e2Ese payaso no tiene ni la mitad de tu talento, pero est\u00c3\u00a1 haciendo una fortuna en ese traje de Hombre de Hojalata\u00e2?, en clara alusi\u00c3\u00b3n a otro superh\u00c3 (C)roe, Iron Man. Adecuadamente, sin que Birdman sea una pel\u00c3\u00adcula de superh\u00c3 (C)roes, el mundo de \u00c3 (C)stos permea el filme: George Clooney, Edward Norton, Robert Downey y Michael Keaton son ahora considerados grandes actores, pero en alg\u00c3\u00ban momento dieron vida a un superh\u00c3 (C)roe, sea de manera exitosa (Keaton como Batman, Downey como Iron Man), regular (Norton como Hulk) o mala (Clooney como el Batman de Schumacher). Incluso Emma Stone tiene relaci\u00c3\u00b3n con los mismos, tras haber aparecido en las dos recientes pel\u00c3\u00adculas de Spider-Man.\n\nBirdman representa quiz\u00c3\u00a1 el mejor trabajo de I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu, quien como lo mencion\u00c3 (C) al principio, se reinventa de una manera hilarante, pero al mismo tiempo profunda y que invita a la reflexi\u00c3\u00b3n acerca de diversos temas como la aceptaci\u00c3\u00b3n, la trascendencia, la importancia o no del \u00c3 (C)xito, la fama y la realizaci\u00c3\u00b3n personal. Divertida, visualmente asombrosa y diferente, Birdman es un pel\u00c3\u00adcula redonda por donde se le vea y un muy agradable y sorpresivo regreso de I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu al cine de alt\u00c3\u00adsima calidad. Simplemente imprescindible.",

Which is incredibly refreshing.\n\nBig names are visibly acting in the same space, oftentimes physically interacting.\n\nThere's no 'cut to close-up' as characters deliver dialogue, which makes for a more organic viewing experience.\n\n(Sidenote: Hollywood should ban the 'cut to close-up.')\n\nBirdman isn't going to be your favorite, but it's still great.\n\nThe writing is strong; the protagonist's plight is timely and moving. The characters interact compellingly. The subject matter is thought provoking.\n\nAlthough this term is overused, it takes a 'gritty' in-depth look at stage acting.\n\nThe metahumor is consistent and pointed. Even the casting is ironic.\n\nMichael Keaton playing the washed up retired superhero. Edward Norton as a pompous know-it-all veteran.\n\nWanna know who's excellent? Naomi Watts.\n\nShe delivers a stellar performance as Lesley; in a role that somewhat calls back to Mulholland Drive, in which she plays a sexually conflicted up-and-coming actress.\n\nEmma Stone is ten types of terrific, but they shouldn't have spoiled her monologue in the trailer.\n\nTurns out Zach Galifianakis can play off-type extremely well, which comes as no surprise.\n\nAndrea Riseborough is lesser known, but holds her own.\n\nFinally, Amy Ryan plays a totally different character from her role in Gone Baby Gone and fits in perfectly with a slew of other great performers.\n\nAlthough the trailer spoils most, the special effects are decent enough.\n\nThe surreal portion is a welcome addition to the common cinematic experience, and contributes uniquely.\n\nBirdman's a visual treat, as they say.\n\nPeople seem to enjoy this flick. After all, what's not to like?\n\nIt's still in limited release, but you shouldn't have trouble finding a screening nearby.\n\nExpect a moving dramatic piece about the thespian business and you shouldn't feel disappointed.\n\nAs always, the best advice remains the same.\n\nBe a salmon - expect nothing, and eventually, you'll feel something.\n\nResonates nicely with the subtitle, no?",

The cinematography was certainly off-beat, but brilliantly so, as it left me entranced upon the actors as they flew around the dingy corners of the narrow (and at times soaring) avenues. Michael Keaton easily stole \"the show\", and delivered quite possibly the most versatile and breathtaking performance I have seen from an actor in my life time. Nay, I kid you not. And Edward Norton and Naomi Watts both rose far above the challenge shown in previous roles, to say nothing of Emma Stone's bringing of the heat, which was turned up considerably more than in her typical \"geeky girl next door\" roles. Zach Galifianikis, while very svelte, seemed slightly uncomfortable among the rest of the cast, yet still managed to bring more sophistication and class than previously shown. The writing was brilliant. The execution of the narrative was impeccable. This movie deserves to be in every theater, but sadly, it isn't. So, if you want to be taken on a roller-coaster of laughs, deep emotion, and mild insanity, you'll need to get to your local art house or movie tavern to experience this journey.

The former superhero movie star is in his Broadway dressing room looking out onto the world from his window. All the while a voice in his head is growling, the devil on his shoulder,  judging his every move. \nKeaton plays a washed up actor who used to be a box office superhero star decades before. He is trying to get his last big hit on Broadway, in which he by directs and stars in. But for Riggan, it is hard while his alter-ego makes him doubt himself all the time. His alter superhero background in the film is clearly an allusion to Keaton\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s role as Batman back in 1989 and this realistic film references other box office superheroes such as Robert Downey Jr. and Jeremy Renner by making jokes about how they\u00c3\u00a2(TM)re all \u00c3\u00a2wearing capes now.\u00c3\u00a2?\n    Birdman guides you through a journey of tight staircases and crowded hallways. You experience the fictional flight of Riggan, escaping his daily stress as he soars above skyscrapers. You can feel the pain of Emma Stone\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s character, Sam, as she watches her father\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s rapid break down. These perfectly choreographed shots are just the beginning of the many things that are great about Birdman. Every scene is accompanied by a powerful score and incredible acting.\nThe biggest struggle Riggan has with his play,\u00c3\u00a2What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\u00c3\u00a2?, is his co-star, Mike Shiner. After the lead actor gets injured on set, Shiner is called to fill in before audience previews. Shiner, portrayed by Edward Norton, known for Fight Club and American History X. He is an outgoing actor who acts as if he is just being himself on stage but is self-absorbed and shallow off. Shiner struggles to find his way as a human being and how to become the best he can be. Lesley, played by Naomi Watts who is known for The Impossible, Shiner\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s significant other, who is fulfilling her childhood dream of playing on Broadway. Her stress over her first Broadway role, coupled with Shiner playing her stage love interest, is a recipe for disaster.\nAnother actor who pulls off a great role, is none other than Zach Galifianakis. As Riggan\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s manager and best friend, Brandon Vander Hey, he helps him through his toughest moments and does his best to make everything right. Amy Ryan, who was in Gone Baby Gone, plays Riggan\u00c3\u00a2(TM)s ex-wife, she only has brief screen time, but through her presence, we witness Riggan at his lowest and highest points. \nIn the end, every actor in this movie did a huge amount work to pull of such a phenomenal production and the director, Alejandro G. I\u00c3\u00c2\u00b1\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1rritu, made a fantastic film. Birdman is a rollercoaster that shows us that we must hit rock bottom to rise back up. Birdman is one of the best movies you will see all year.\n\n-Chris Honthy",

Turdman is about a failing actor named Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) who is trying to make a comeback by adapting a short story into a play which he is starring, writing and producing himself.\n\nWhile the movie isn't 100% terrible, it tries to cover the fact that it is bad by throwing an all A-list cast at you including Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis and Naomi Watts. They all play people that seem to just serve the purpose of distracting the main character and delivering some very flat jokes.\n\nAll the actors give in good performances, it's just that they are all such big assholes or immature children that it was extremely annoying to watch. I know some black comedies are mean in nature but I couldn't help but feel like every character deserved a kick to the head. Emma Stone, playing Keaton's daughter Sam, was the most likeable for me and actually the only character I was invested in. She's doing her Emma Stone shtick but it played well here and felt very sincere.\n\nThe major issue with this movie is its message and writing. It spends its two-hour running time trying to undermine the superhero genre and everyone involved for lacking substance or selling out. Which is a very fair point but the way it goes about it is very poor. You can't knock a whole genre of film for lacking substance when the very movie saying that lacks it as well.\n\nThat's the thing, the whole time this movie is trying to say \"FOCUS ON THE ART\". This movie has an attitude that feels like from the get go has earned it's praise and recognition while it's constantly massaging it's own ego till the very end.\n\nOne scene in particular shows Keaton completely ripping apart this woman's review of his play (which he does have good reason for) and saying that critics are people who wanted to create but couldn't. Which is very hypocritical of Birdman because as I said, it wants to be this Oscar darling but at the same time is making fun of the people who dictate what's Oscar worthy? I'm sorry Birdman but you can't have your cake and eat it too.\n\nAnd I'm not saying the Oscars are the final word on what's good or not, it is just that it's so obvious this movie wants that attention. Like American Hustle last year, all star cast, sub-par story/substance.\n\nAnother issue is the quality of the writing for this -ahem- \"COMEDY\". The awkward pauses after some lines should have just included a laugh track as the silence lasts long enough just to let the viewer know that they should be laughing at that part. Also, there are enough ball jokes in here to make Seth Rogen blush.\n\nBehind Birdman's fantastic direction and cinematography are a weak story, dumb script and annoying characters. Birdman needs to take the pedestal it puts itself on and shove it up it's own ass.",

That's definitely not the case here, as I found myself grasping on to every conversation that takes place. Michael Keaton totally shines, really showing us what he's capable of.

            "content": "First and foremost, Birdman is a satire. The movie swings a razor sharp sword that leaves virtually no segment of the entertainment industry uncut. I just wanted to get that out of the way, so it doesn't get lost in all the other crazy-awesomeness this movie brings to the table.\n\n     What elevates this movie into the realm of greatness is while it is skewering all of the egos and insecurities from Hollywood to Broadway, it presents itself in such a way as to showcase all that is admirable, compelling and wondrous about the very subject it is ripping to shreds.\n\n     The movie, which is fully titled Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), is the brainchild of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who directed the movie and co-wrote the wildly original screenplay.\n\n     Inarritu is best known for bleak, weighty (yet exquisite) films like 21 Grams, Babel and Biutiful, so while it's not surprising to see him deliver something this complex and ambitious, it is a little jaw-dropping to see him make a movie this buoyant, lively and funny.\n\n     I really can't go any further without talking about the movie's star, Michael Keaton, who quite bravely delivers the performance of his career in a role where at first glance he appears to be playing himself. Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a middle-aged actor trying to emerge from decades of irrelevance after helming an insanely popular superhero franchise. You can see the similarities.\n     Riggan was Birdman decades ago, but now he is desperately trying to reignite his career on Broadway by writing, directing and starring in a play adapted from a Raymond Carver short story.\n\n     But once you get past the meta-fa\u00e7ade, Keaton dives deep to play a man burdened with regrets after falling victim to nearly every single one of the trappings of fame.\n\n     Riggan is barely keeping it all together with (some) help from his high-strung attorney and co-financer, Jake (Zach Galifianakis). Of course, it only complicates matters Riggan is dating one of his co-stars, Laura (Andrea Riseborough), while his other two co-stars - gifted prima donna Mike (Edward Norton) and highly self-conscious Lesley (Naomi Watts) - are involved in their own toxic relationship.\n\n     To top it all off, Riggan has employed his volatile, recovering-addict daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), to be his personal assistant. You can already tell when you've set up the chessboard with this many screwed up characters played by such talented actors you are going to be in for a treat.\n\n     There's also the added wrinkle of Riggan's sanity as he hears the voice of Birdman in his head and appears to be capable of fantastic feats which may, or may not, be as real as they are presented.\n\n     But then this movie is just getting warmed up as it doubles down and achieves the amazing technical feat of appearing to be filmed in one continuous shot (there are a few \"cheats,\" where the camera is taken off the actors for a moment or two, but for the most part, it spools out like a real-time play).\n\n     Birdman also looks fantastic as it was shot by Oscar-winning cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who, for my money, is one of the best directors of photography working today.\n\n     There is a lot going on with this movie, but never once does it feel overbearing or pretentious - an impressive achievement in itself when you think about it. Birdman is quite simply one of the best movies of the year and certain to be touted when year-end awards start rolling in.\n\n    Keaton has some commanding scenes. This is his movie and he seems to know it. We get to see him like never before in pristine moments of whimsy, defeat, despair, and agony. It's one of the year's best performances no doubt.\n\n     Keaton, Inarritu and Lubezki should be locks when it comes to Oscar nominations (along with the discordant, jazz-drum score by Antonio Sanchez which seems to compliment the chaos of the film perfectly). Stone and Norton are also certain to snag themselves some Best Supporting nominations.\n\n     Birdman is a film-lover's dream, as it gives you everything you love about movies and then mocks the rest. And if we're being honest, actors, directors, producers and critics deserved to be mocked a whole lot more than they are.",

            "content": "Full of win.  So this is about an aging, washed-up former comic strip actor (Michael Keaton) who used to play the renowned Birdman back in his heyday.  He's trying to do something relevant with his career by adapting, directing and starring in a production of \"What We Talk about When We Talk about Love\", but circumstances such as difficult actors to work with, a faltering relationship with his daughter and his antagonizing alter ego are sure to make things as difficult as possible.  This was easily the movie I was most anticipating this Oscar season; the trailer was brilliantly cut and one that I watched a countless number of times, everything about it appealed to my sensibilities as a moviegoer, and this boasts a cast that you can get excited about.  Then, I learned about a technical element that made me made me get exponentially more pumped up: this movie is filmed to create the illusion that it is all one shot.  A tracking shot that lasts longer than a few minutes is difficult enough to choreograph, imagine the hurdles they faced doing that for an entire 2 hour movie, or at least creating that illusion that it was done in one take.  To the extent of my knowledge, this has only been executed twice previously, with Russian Ark and Rope.  Still haven't seen Russian Ark yet (but I will eventually, as it's on the 1,001 list), and if I am understanding correctly, it is the only one that legitimately accomplishes the feat in one shot.  Rope, on the other hand, does it by masking the cuts at appropriate moments when they are the least noticeable, which is what Birdman does as well, only without awkwardly crash cutting into the back of somebody's sport jacket.  You may label this a gimmick, but the fact of the matter is that this is a technique that works, and because of this innovative tactic, it makes for a much more immersive experience.  You don't want to take your eyes off the screen because after five minutes, you've already realized that you are watching something special, and you can't wait to see what will happen next.  Apart from being a technical marvel, this is just a very enjoyable film and a treat to watch.  One thing that you may not anticipate is how funny it is; it is unexpectedly hilarious, and while there is many a moment of hard hitting drama, it is perfectly paced with comedic timing to break the ice on any tense moment.  There is totally an additional layer added here when you add the fact that Keaton used to play Batman in 1989 and 1992, and if there is a word that I would use to describe this movie, that word would be relevant.  We are at the height of the superhero craze, and from a logical standpoint, this makes so much sense for not only Keaton, but for what a number of actors may be doing 20 years down the pipeline.  He does an amazing job, really putting himself into this character with no boundaries; he could have easily turned down this role and been above it all, but instead he delivers a performance that rings incredibly honest.  And the supporting cast is nothing short of stellar; Emma Stone has a electrifying monologue that will give you chills, Edward Norton is the best he's been since Fight Club, and Zach Galifianakis delivers the performance of his career so far.  This also plays very well if you have a background in theatre, which I happen to have, with the most coincidental thing being that these actors had to rehearse tirelessly to get the timing of it all down for the for the one shot technique, which is something you would have to do if you were starring in a stage play.  This succeeds wildly at every point, and with a vibrant drum score to underscore the drama, get ready to be mesmerized.",

When it comes to dramas or comedies, people usaully don't pay a lot of attention to sound design; those types of movies tend to focus on the characters and their story. Birdman, however, does a very admirable job at making sure the music, sound effects, and little tiny things here and there awesome. Breaking down movies to the very core, it's video and audio and audio is basically 50% of a movie, given it's not one of those artsy silent films, so why not do the 50% some justice. I know I'm making it sound like sound is everything by gushing so much, but it was just something that I noticed and really appreciated. Moving on from that, this film is funny and never too dramatic; any time someone is being emotional or when a moment is getting dramatic, they're able to save themselves from getting too cheesy with some humor. Everyone gives outstanding performances with special mention to Keaton, and they're able to shift between theater acting and movie acting. As the cast performs their on-stage and off-stage roles you can see a change in tone, giving the film a low-brow outlook on theater, acting, and films. It celebrates the art whilst making fun of it and if you've ever been in drama class, you'll be laughing a lot due to its very accurate portrayal. One last note; amazing camera work and editing. The movie is one seamless shot pulled off by a few clever editing trick here and there. Still with the editing it's done beautifully and gives it that play kinda feel.

Real and flawed characters.  Greatly cinematic and addicting.  I won't say anything more because I don't want to spoil but check it out ASAP!!  You won't be disappointed.",

But between titans like Keaton and Norton there was little to complain about.  Watts, Riseborough, and Galafianakis all had very polished performances that matched the tone of the film to a 'T,' which was perhaps the film's greatest value: a consistency of mood, character, and theme that drove the, albeit thin, stroryline to its inevitable conclusion.  Though I must admit, the last moment I felt was a bit of a copout.  Like the ending the \"Inception\" we are left with a blurred line between fact and fiction that sticks with us, but I'd argue, not for the right reasons.

I haven't seen them yet but after watching Birdman I'm excited to check them out.  Now something that I knew going in was that most of the movie is filmed to look like one continuous shot and it's amazingly executed.  To my knowledge, only Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948) has tried this but had it's limitations because of technology of the time.  With this movie the cuts are so carefully planned they're practically invisible and the effect was pure cinema.  There were moments where you can guess the cut but that's as close as it gets.  I wouldn't doubt if I was wrong either.  The story was absolutely fantastic having a self awareness and relevance to the movie industry.  The criticism never felt self indulgent and were honest.  After all, what better movie to make criticisms than one as masterful as this one.  And of course, all of the performances were great and everyone had a moment to shine.  Needless to say their was a lot of thought and effort put into this movie and the end result really delivers.

I couldn't pick the best one as they were all equally as good as each other. My favourite part of this film is that they did it in one shot. This means that recognition needs to be given to the editing team as they have to make sure that the whole shot syncs. This is something that I have first hand experience on as I used to do media and found out that this is a hard process. Credit also needs to be given to the director who came up with this idea and wanted audience members to have a great story as well as letting us appreciate cinematography. The whole way through, I didn't want the film to end.\n       This film does follow certain characters at some points on how they have problems during the starting point of this play while dealing with their consequences. It shows that everything may look good in front of the screen but behind the scenes, they are just ordinary people trying to figure out how they can get through life. \n       In the end of the day, birdman has made me appreciate actors and those behind the scenes as they deal with a lot in order to impress people and become the person they are today so that they can be remembered",

Keaton somehow finds a way to tap into a real piece-of-work of a person to bring his character to life without making you think Keaton may actually be this kind of person in real life.  Keaton's range has always been his strength from Batman to Beetlejuice to Birdman.  \n\nEd Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough are all great supporters.  Norton probably plays the exact opposite kind of character as he is in real life as a real brandish and over-confident egomaniac.  Unfortunately, he sits out most of the final act.  Stone comes in second as the troubled daughter who is both endearing and repulsive in nature with her bad habits and carefree attitude.\n\nThe real strength of this film is the direction.  Alejandro pulls of one of the most outlandish feats I have ever seen in a movie; making the entire film seem as if it was one entire long cut without any cuts or breaks.  I heard the actors talk about the trouble and difficulty with this kind of technique, but it really made everything feel fluid and suspenseful.  This and the entire premise of the film of a washed up, old actor trying to revive...maybe refurbish...his one historic career in a new avenue just to prove he still has it gives Birdman a real presence.",

            "content": "'Birdman' is a wickedly clever piece of meta-art. Riffing on his own career, Michael Keaton stars as an aging actor ostensibly searching for authenticity and respect while actually seeking petty fame from a new source. \n\nThe movie unfolds very amusingly as an adaptation of the play its characters are themselves adapting from a short story. It's a bit tongue in cheek, but the narrative complexity is a huge amount of fun to observe. Dysfunction flows from stage to screen with hilarious (and sometimes heart-wrenching) results, and the characters, who are vainly obsessed with \"art,\" subtly deflect a cultural critique of celebrity back onto the audience itself.\n\nThe glue that holds the movie together is its cinematography. The entire film is composed as one long tracking shot. It simulates the effect, of course, of a bird's eye view and suggests a symbiosis between the audience's constant demand for more and the actors' constant demand for attention. One can imagine entire film courses being taught about the film's technique.\n\nAlejandro Inarritu has made a career out of depressing audiences with contrived stories and melodramatic acting. It would have been hard to guess that he had something so playful in him. The movie takes a few trips to the soul-poisoning sludge that fills New York (and humanity's) gutters, but it generally offers a hopeful vision of redemption.\n\nAnd Michael Keaton? The movie pokes fun at the worthlessness of awards, but when Keaton wins his, they will be quite valuable and well-deserved.",

            "content": "What is a critic but a crusher of dreams? A film critic is a cold and cruel mind that looks only once at the months of sweat and passion of artists and either discard or regretfully stamps approval. A critic is a coward, a failed artist that has become a pessimist and envies other artist's success and opportunities. A critic's opinion can crush a film's success, but what is a critic's opinion but the opinion of one person? How many people are the same? How many people have identical opinions in the vast subject matters covered in film? Don't worry, I'm not going to stop writing reviews, or be merciful for any film, but this most recent film has really made me reflect on the fragile lives of artists.\n\nBirdman is a film that took a lot of risks, and that is admirable whether such risks ended up rewarding or condemning the film. In Birdman's case the results are unpredictable for every audience member. Birdman is such a unique film, that it can either be loved or hated by fans, there is no in between. Its risk ends up appealing more to critics than the masses, but it overall makes your reception to it be unique from anyone else's. However, if you ask for my opinion, I will tell you that Birdman is one of this decade's best films. There is no other film like it. \n\nBirdman reminded me a lot of Begin Again, in the way that it conveyed the career struggles and benefits of an artist (in the case of Begin Again it was musicians). Birdman tells the story of an actor, Riggan (Michael Keaton), who seeks to revive his career on a Broadway play he adapts, directs, and stars in. In his peak years, Riggan had been the titular character in a superhero franchise called Birdman, decades ago; after refusing to do any more sequels, however, his acting career faded away. But in his journey for re-vindication Riggan has to also battle: to gain back the love of the daughter he was never there for (Emma Stone), to prevent his celebrity co-star (Edward Norton) from outshining him, to keep his cast together, appease critics, and to prevent himself from going mad. \n\nThere are various aspects that make Birdman different from any movie you've ever seen. For one, Birdman is filmed so that it all looks like one seamless shot. Now while the cinematography might get all the credit in this feat, it really is the editing that deserves the praise, it must have been nerve-racking to stitch together the film so that it would look that way. Another aspect that I enjoyed was the fact that the music was percussion-based and performed in a jazzy and loose kind of way. When analyzing it one sees that there really is no other music that could have properly conveyed the immediacy and complete chaos of an artist's life. \n\nThe acting was spectacular thanks to a resurrecting Michael Keaton (who's own career parallels that of Riggan) who might just have given his best performance yet. Keaton portrays Riggan in such a realistic and confused way that, along with the seamless editing, the audience felt they were seeing everything in the first person. One literally felt as if we were experiencing the film from Keaton's own eyes. Meanwhile Edward Norton also might have given a performance that not only earned him critical acclaim, but a mainstream resurgence as well. The more minor players include Naomi Watts who plays a cast member and Edward Norton's wife and is able to give us the true distress and emotional breakdowns that actors and generally artists feel. And Emma Stone, the actress that appears in every movie today, ranging from The Amazing Spiderman to Woody Allen's Magic in the Moonlight, she keeps mesmerizing audiences and bettering herself with every film. \n\nOne mustn't overlook Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu's responsibility in the film. The Mexican native was the man responsible of taking such risks in the narrative and cinematic aspects. I\u00f1arritu wrote and directed Birdman and he does so in such a way that it reminds us of the long lost auteurs of the likes of Hitchcock, Orson Welles, and Billy Wilder. \n\nBirdman is a must see, it hypnotizes those loyal moviegoers, and lets them experience a unique journey. But for other the film might seem incredibly weird and boring, who's ending and symbolism you did not understand. Depends how you choose to look at it.",

Hadn't seen the trailer, didn't really know what it was about. Simply heard it mentioned by my personal go to for non-mainstream movies, Anderson Cowan of The Film Vault. God it was good. Great acting, good story, funny, dramatic, great looking. All that and more.\n\nDirected by: Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (who you may know from Amores perros)\n\nWritten by: Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Nicolas Giacobone\n\nStarring: Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts\n\nMusic by: Antonio Sanchez\n\nCinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki\n\n\nI'm going to try and not get carried away with this review, but I do love this movie. Like I said, I didn't know a whole lot about this movie going into it. Right in the beginning you see Michael Keaton's character, Riggan Thomson, meditating. Three feet off the ground while a gravely voice starts to narrate. A voice very similar to what many actors have attempted when portraying Batman. Which Keaton has done. Quickly we learn that Riggan used to play Birman in very successful movies. Now he's past his prime and watching other actors in massive superhero blockbusters long after he hung up his wings. Now he's trying to open a play on Broadway that he adapted, directed and is starring in. And he's risking it all.\n\nUnder normal circumstances if you told me a movie was about a play trying to open on Broadway I'd say \"well... that's nice.\" I wouldn't be interested. But this movie got me hooked right away. So many different stories going on below the main plot.\n\nRiggan is depressed about his place in his career, desperate for this play to be a critical and financial success. He's dealing with a daughter he doesn't have a good relationship with who is also fresh out of drug rehab, and he might be a little crazy. The Batman-esque Birman voice makes several appearances, acting as a kind of devil on the shoulder voice for Riggan. It's hilarious and feels real. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think we all have that dark little voice. Maybe we don't all actually hear sounds like someone who's possibly mentally ill does, but we can feel it, right? When a co-worker says or does something ignorant or offends us, we all have that dark voice that says \"Who does this guy think he is? I'm the man around here.\" Or something like that. \n\n\nEdward Norton's character is brought in at the last minute to take over a role (Mike Shiner). Mike is supremely talented and the critics love him, Riggan is desperate for critical attention so his play can be successful. Edward Norton really shines in the movie, but besides Mike stepping in, he's also in a relationship with one of the co-stars (Naomi Watts as Lesly), he butts heads with Riggan over parts of the production, flirts with Riga's daughter, and is also suffering from his own personal issues. He's charming, funny and also really kind of a douche nozzle.\n\nThe rest of the cast has their own problems that get a couple minutes here and there. Everyone is great.\n\nThe real treat of the movie is the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki. Using some editing trickery, most of the movie is presented as one single, long take. This means that when Riggan and Mike meet for the first time to rehearse a scene, it appears as though we are really watching rehearsal. There's no cuts back and forth to each actor, just a subtly moving camera for coverage. \n\nEvery blocking movement by the actors was planned out months in advance so that the camera movements could be as well. Which is especially remarkable because the actors seemed so comfortable I would have guessed the opposite while watching the movie. It felt like the actors were much freer to do what they wanted.\n\nSimilar to Interstellar, Inception and others, Birman is going to have people talking for years about what happened at the end. What truly happened? I think I know, but I'm not sure. Might have to watch it again before I decide. But in the end, it doesn't really matter because everything you just watched was great.\n\nI think it's likely that this movie gets nominated for some awards, possibly for the actors, certainly for the cinematography and it deserves whatever it gets.\n\nBottom Line: 4.5 stars out of 5. Really great movie. Can't wait to see it again.",

            "content": "Super realism is a good way to describe this movie. It's too meta to be meta and too magical to be magical realism. At times it is charming and silly. Mostly, it's suffocating and clanging.\nMichael Keaton plays Riggan Thompson, an actor once famous for playing a winged superhero with a guttural snarl. Sound familiar? Now he is the writer, director, and star of a Broadway play, and he believes his last shot at redemption. \nIt's a shame that the actors talents are wasted in a film that is so self-aware it becomes self-conscious. At an early point in the film, Emma Stone's character asks Keaton's what is the point of the production? Is it for the recognition and praise of an older, rich, mostly white, audience who will quickly forget the play while getting coffee? The question can easily be applied to Birdman and it is a question left unanswered. There are few answers and even less meaning in any of the characters. \n The cinematography, while technically amazing, becomes distracting. Emmanuel Lubezki makes the camera run, fly, and occasionally breathe. However, it's an moment where you focus on the camera instead of what is in front of it. Another instance is the music that starts in the soundtrack, then occasionally bleeds into the action on screen. The drummer playing the music is seen on screen and then disappears but is still heard. It is one of many moments that you marvel at, but forget because it doesn't add anything to the film. \nIt's a tiring film that is all sound and fury, signifying nothing.",

            "content": "Ids, egos and superegos collide and combust (in a single take!) on stages as concrete as the Broadway theatre and as fantastical as the imaginings of a self-obsessed actor in Alejando Gonz\u00e1lez I?\u00e1rritu's Birdman. As in the myth of Icarus, to which his wily script often alludes both visually and verbally, I?\u00e1ritu has high-flying ambitions for what is possibly his most personal film to date. But rather than crash and burn, his satiric slant on the artist's odyssey soars magnificently on its dark feathery wings.\n\nMichael Keaton stars - in a performance that vies to redefine his career - as Riggan Thompson, a washed-up former movie star seeking respect and validation by directing and starring in his own adaptation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love on Broadway. He had once played a popular superhero (the eponymous Birdman) in a series of lucrative but disposable comic book blockbusters that brought him fame and fortune, but not artistic fulfillment.\n\nNow, some twenty years after hanging up his dopey bird suit, he's risking so much more than just his money and reputation by mounting this prestigious production. The tenuous relationship with his recovering drug addict daughter (Emma Stone), his fragile sense of self, and even his grasp on reality hang in the balance while the pressure mounts.\n\nI?\u00e1rritu has taken some bold artistic risks himself with Birdman; Much ado has been made about his splashy, \"unedited\" single-take approach. There actually are several digital editing cuts so expertly achieved that they're invisible to us. Otherwise, the film is designed to resemble one extended single take, shot by the modern master of lengthy tracking shots, Emmanuel Lubezki.\n\nThe trick itself isn't an original one; Alfred Hitchcock famously attempted it with Rope, as did Alexander Sokurov more recently with Russian Ark. But Lubezki's magic with light, colour and kineticism elevates this camera stunt above the gimmick into which it could have deteriorated. Beyond its visual panache, the greatest virtue of this uninterrupted shooting style is the chance it affords us to observe the cast's uninterrupted performances. Seems appropriate for a story about live theatre, no?\n\nBut the thing about live theatre is that there's a lot that can, and does, go wrong. As the days left until opening night are counted down by a gong show of disastrous rehearsals and previews, Riggan finds himself at odds with his actors, his family, his audience, but most of all himself. One minute he's humbly self-aware, the next he's the sort of egomaniac who'd shoot his nose to spite his face.\n\nThe show within a show we see him preparing reflects more and more this struggle between his doggedly driven superego and his hallucinatory id, the victor of which may decide the fate of his very existence. One of the masterstrokes of  I?\u00e1rritu's devilishly funny screenplay (which he co-wrote with Nicolas Gi\u00e1cobone, Alexander Dinelaris & Armando Bo) is how it populates Riggan's world with characters who represent the conflicting levels of his psyche.\n\nAll the self-conscious perceptions he has about his family, his career, and his art are reflected in the interactions he shares with his concerned ex-wife (Amy Ryan), his harried best friend/agent (Zack Galifianakis), and the New York Times' hostile theatre critic (Lindsay Duncan). His raging subconscious delusions, meanwhile, are embodied by his prickly method actor costar (an hilarious Edward Norton), his leading lady/lover (Andrea Riseborough), and the ghost of Birdman himself, who taunts Riggan with barbed reminders of his lost stardom.\n\nIt's only fitting that a piece of art that's about about art imitating life would imitate life itself. So cinephiles can be forgiven for gleefully reminding those of us who've forgotten, that Keaton - much like the character he plays here - hit the apex of his own big screen career (until now, that is) over twenty years ago by playing the iconic title superhero in Tim Burton's Batman movies.\n\nWhile it's impossible to measure the extent to which Keaton's own history and perspectives inform his performance, what's undeniable is that he's tapped into something truly special with his work here. Ever the versatile performer, he plays Riggan as a grounded human being and as an artist driven mad with equal conviction, building to a climatic epiphany that's as terrifying as it is bleakly comical.\n\nYet as tempting as it is to play up the \"meta\" aspect of Keaton as Riggan, the truth is it's probably more accurate to read I?\u00e1rritu as Riggan. He is the artist who has put himself out there on the line and delivered a near masterpiece. Sure, Birdman's not perfect (a few too many unresolved subplots clamber for our attention), but I?\u00e1rritu flies just close enough to the sun for us to see the world from Riggan Thompson's eyes... without falling back down in flames.\n\n**** out of ****",

Why, it's \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\", a film that will blow the viewer away after watching it. There is so much to talk about this movie, it is too much to actually discuss; you just have to see it for yourself. \"Birdman\" is a great look at an actor's ego being pushed to the limit, and the choices he must make to maintain it being in balance.\n\nThe story follows a washed up actor named Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), who rose to fame by playing a superhero named Birdman. Unfortunately, Riggan cannot let go of his past as he tries to make a comeback on Broadway. Here, Riggan must deal with the demands of actors, his production team, his family, and ultimately, himself to get back to reality.\n\n\"Birdman\" is a fantastic piece of film that needs to be seen. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu who directed the feature, as well as co-wrote it, made this movie work with a great script and superb direction. While the music of simply drums is the only soundtrack you hear, it represents the action being taken by our character Riggan, and all the thoughts and emotions running through his head. The setting of the theater world is perfect as we have an actor trying to reclaim his fame and glory. The costumes definitely fit our characters, even Riggan who has an interesting scene where he is running around in his underwear. The cast is amazing; we have Emma Stone, Edward Norton, and Naomi Watts delivering great performances. Even Zach Galifianakis, who traditionally is not accustomed to films with the theme of repentance, gives a grand performance in a supporting role.\n\nYet, there are two things there are two things that make this movie really stand out. First off, Michael Keaton delivers a magnificent performance; considering he is an actor that has played a superhero before, this is totally related towards his character in the film. Keaton just nails the character of Riggan, and it is a marvel to watch. Secondly,  the story goes into some very mature subjects along with the lesson of repentance. How can an actor turn away from the past, and what are the consequences that go into a mid-life crisis, are all explored in this movie's story. There's even a bit fantasy thrown in the mix, which gives the whole scenario a more in-depth look at how a production can take on an actor's personality. The whole movie is a showcase on what the acting world is like, and how is can literally change a person.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Birdman\" is a wonderful film showcasing what extremes an actor must do in order to keep his sanity going; all through one glorious shot.",

His previous works ( Death Trilogy, Biutiful ) included stunning visuals, story and amazing acting talents but Birdman takes everything to a whole new level. Keaton, Norton and Emma Stone have been nominated for Oscars and rightly so. \n\nThe one continuous take style cinematography is the thing that kept me glued to the screen for two hours. Another Oscar worthy work by Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men, Gravity)\n\nIt is that weird but nice feeling I have about the film after I've finished watching the film just like I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's previous works. \n\nFor me it's one of those films that I'll watch once in a few years to remind myself how great it is but also how different it is that I just can't watch it again in a short space of time. \n\nEasily one of the best films of the year!",

Very few of the hundreds of movies I've seen can compete with the brilliance of Birdman. for the first time, I left a theater absolutely astonished at the perfection I had see onscreen. Alejandro Inarritu far exceeds any expectation i had of him(I was already a big fan of his work) and produces a truly revolutionary work. There is not a flaw noticeable in this movie. The acting of the cast is outstanding with Emma Stone, Michael Keaton and Edward Norton giving career best performances, every scene gripping with them in it and well acted. The drum score beat of the soundtrack gives a restless energy to the movie like its alive. The cinematography of Lubezki is his best since Tree of Life, and the continuous take it tires to achieve is no gimmick, but great camerawork pair with acting. The script has great elements of black humor mixed with emotion. And Inarritu juggles this circus masterfully as director, showing us the promise from Amores Perros and Biutiful. Every time i put on a movie, I hope for an experience like this. I couldn't help but sit staring at the screen excitedly, grinning at the the movie on hand and its glory. I was so in awe by this movie it took hours to recover from it. It is a masterpiece, a compliment far too given. If cinema is alive today, it is in this movie. 5 out of 5",

The movie loses me in some of its pretense, and its Broadway actory insiderness. And even more in playing with the edges of reality when insanity or suicide should be more stone cold serious. Zach Gallifinakis is great in drama without having to ham it up, and he looks great at his new weight. Oh and having a former Batman play lead lead is perfect.

Plot wise you can think of this as the male version of Black Swan except the ending wasn't quite as good or as clear. I thought the music was especially good, it's all just jazz drums but really good jazz drums. A lot of the humor is good. There are some really shocking and dark moments and turns in this movie that definitely make it worth seeing despite it's flaws.

            "content": "There's quite a few epic superhero scale battles going on here in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance). To start with, we have Riggan (Michael Keaton) as the aging actor, once famous for playing the iconic superhero, Birdman. Battling to find himself, rediscover his family, and bring meaning to his career by financing, directing and starring in his own Broadway play. This is turn leads to a discussion about the theatre and acting as art versus the seemingly shallow offerings from Hollywood. And how weird is it that Keaton, once famous for playing Batman, is here, in this? Is this some crazy Hollywood introspective therapy session? Is Keaton okay? Can we expect to see Robert Downey Jr. in Birdman 2 in a few years?\n\nIn a way, I thought of this movie as a marriage counselor working with these two theatrical worlds. Someone saying 'hey, look, you both have your strengths, so can't we all get along?' Because this movie, incredibly, is like a blend of the two. Its single camera, single shot style acts like a fly on the wall, recording live events as they happen. This is a stage play, about the creation of a stage play, by a man trying to reconcile his past glories, and we the movie going audience get to watch the drama unfold.\n\nThis style of film making incredibly doesn't ever feel gimmicky or overused either, as Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu never gets too carried away with the idea. The camera serves the really great script, moves when it's time to find another element in this drama, and stays put when it's time to focus on the film's superb cast. Michael Keaton's performance is almost certainly going to get some attention during the next award season, as will Edward Norton's, and maybe even Emma Stone's.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is a quirky little film, and its style may take a little getting used to at first. Just remember you're the fly on the wall watching this drama take place. The movie is rated R for language, limited sexual content and violence.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a great looking film, shot in and around Times Square in New York City, so I suggest you see this in a theater. At home a HD viewing on your TV is recommended. I wouldn't suggest you watch this on anything portable.\n\nBest Moment: << mild spoiler >>\n\nKeaton's performance is one of the best I've seen this year, and there's a moment where he loses his cool in his dressing room, that's just mesmerizing. Seemingly using his Birdman powers (or is he?) to throw and destroy objects with his mind!\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/birdman-2014/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "Birdman or [The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance] (2014) - This black comedy directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu stars Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Zach Galifianakis, Lindsay Duncan, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. Former blockbuster actor Riggan (Keaton) after decades tries to regain former glory by directing, writing and acting in a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story. Things don't go as planned as Riggan must deal with the play as it crumbles around him.\n\nMight be an unorthodox way to start my review but I freaking love this movie. This is a rich, challenging, poignant and deeply funny screenplay brought to life in the best and most entertaining way possible. Keeping my typical review structure in tact will be tough considering there's very little, if nothing at all that I dislike about this movie. First and foremost this is a movie about the meaning of \"Art\" but goes so much deeper than that. This film is about relevancy, existence, duality, purpose, family, drinking, film criticism, the nature of the blockbuster versus art itself and how they all interact and intermingle; It couldn't be more perfect. This movie is like you're favourite meal prepared by a top chef; exploring new flavours with each bite you didn't even know existed in that dish.\n\nLet's start with the performances. Michael Keaton makes perfect sense for this role in so many, on the nose, ways its crazy... But that doesn't take away from just how damn good he is in this. It couldn't have been nicer to see a return to form for not only Keaton but Edward Norton as well, who hasn't been this good in a very long time. Now that I mention it, every single performance in this movie is... GREAT! There wasn't a single weak link; from Emma Stone to Naomi Watts to even Zach Galifianakis, these players brought their A-game. These characters are just so likeable, flaws and all. The movie creates a paradigm between the performers and the people themselves making an interestingly layered palette of characters. The dialogue is so self aware, sharp and witty; And the best part is the actors know it and they're eating it up.\n\nThe most noteworthy character in the movie by far was the camera or hell the \"movie\" itself... Shot by the DP for 2013's \"Gravity\", the free-flowing, seemingly one-take nature of the film's execution is just so much fun to watch. Through use of clever editing and impeccable talent from everyone involved, this movie makes goes out of its way to make you feel like you've literally drifted into this world. It's like you're a spirit floating through this wonderful world of angst and theatre. Whether you're looking to see where they hide the cuts or just kicking back and enjoying the show is irrelevant as the result is the same; it's simply remarkable. The movie's jazz drum driven score is not to go without mentioning either as in conjunction with the cinematography it makes for a completely unique movie going experience, one of which I will never forget.\n\n\"Birdman\" not only achieves a lofty goal of saying an awful lot in a mere 2 hours but it also becomes art in its purest form within this medium. It's without question a flawless film in my books, one of very few this year. Every masterful sequence was instilled with raw emotion and thought provoking questions which kept me engaged respectfully while still being so much fun. It's entertaining, sharp, ridiculously funny and just down-right impressive in every way. Though it's certainly not everyone's cup of tea, I do think there's a little something for everyone in \"Birdman\". For the casual, general movie going audience who seek out nothing but conventional mediocre predictability; Make it known that this movie is NOT for you and it knows it... And frankly, it doesn't care (neither do I).\n\nGRADE: A+",

As an independently minded, foreign director helmed, black comedy film featuring recently sub-par actors (Keaton, Galifianakis, Watts) who were pulling out the all the stops I loved the idea at conception.\n\nThen I saw the the film and was blown away from it from the first scene and sentence. Birdman is genuinely inventive on many counts.\nFirstly, the idea of the story progressing \"one take\" propagated by a steady cam and invisible edit points was astonishing. I have not been taken in by such inventive cinematography since Gravity, so it was no surprise that it was shot by the same DP (Director of Photography) as Gravity was; Emmanuel Lubezki.\nSecondly, the way that the minimalist jazz drum score drives the film forward was fantastic. I now have the soundtrack on constant repeat.\n\nThirdly, the genius casting of Michael Keaton to reference to a failing actor from a film franchise. Who else could it have been? Val Kilmer's Batman? Brendan Routh's Superman? Michael Crawford's Condorman? None of the above would have sufficed!\nIn Summary\n\nIt should be noted that all these points would add up to a gimmicky if it wasn't for the story and the way that it unfolds. Riggan Thomas, Keaton, seems to have everyone against him; his daughter, his ex-wife, his new-love interest, his manager, his fellow actors and that strange hidden \"Birdman\" character push and pull him in multiple directions. It's impossible to know which way he could turn.\n\nOn top of all this it is genuinely funny!\nI love it when you leave a film and you aren't quite sure what happened and you know that you'll have to watch it again and soon.\n\nK*",

Everybody else in the cast stepped up big time, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough were spectacular. The movie reminded me of Aronofsky, mainly both Black Swan and The Wrestler. It goes inside his character's mind and you see him slowly going insane. It also has a strong message against the modern blockbuster and superhero films, it's pretty cynical, yet I think it also celebrates it at the same time. It's got a pretty good balance. And the movie makes you believe it was all one shot and it they pulled that off incredibly. I really hope Keaton gets some recognition during Oscar time, he deserves it.",

            "content": "Michael Keaton has his best role in years as a washed-up actor, and former star of a superhero franchise, trying to make a comeback by adapting a Raymond Carver story as a play, in this fantastical comedy. Alejandro G Inarritu directed this backstage farce, which uses elements of magical realism, as a self-reflexive satire on actors and celebrity. Shot in an artificial, continuously fluid, seemingly single take by the virtuoso cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. The movie fails as a conventional meditation on an actor seeking redemption, and a sequence where Keaton confronts an antagonistic theater critic expresses a contemptuous superiority that is reprehensible. It doesn't have the rambunctiousness of classic farce or the piercing humor of a great black comedy, but it's enjoyably slight. Won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Original Screenplay, and Cinematography. Music score is by Antonio Sanchez. Written by Inarritu, Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Jr., and Armando Bo. With Edward Norton, Zack Galifianakis, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts.",

I can't say anything bad about this movie but it just falls short of being a perfect film to me. It's just that I wanted more from some characters like Edward Norton's character as a jerky overly unstable actor. Trust me he's probably the best thing in the whole entire movie next to the the theme, Michael Keaton, and cinematography! I also wanted more from Emma Stone's Character as a drug habit that just got out of rehab and is harsh on her dad most of the time. I know that the movie wants us to know that these are complex characters. Even though I know that I would like for them to have a little more development over the course of the movie. Ok, now let us go to the good stuff! The cinematography is probably the best I have ever seen in film history! The technique of shooting the whole movie in one shot with a camera is brilliant, unique, and affective! The acting was phenomenal all across the board was terrific. The movie is funny, smart, charming, dark, intense, and fun. All these elements makes the movie great as a whole. Screenplay was magnificent with a good script as well. I will love to see this movie again in a month or so! The movie is that good go see it right now! The themes of the movie are brilliantly portrayed in scenes. Fair use of CGI in the movie and it actually looks real! The best directing I have seen this year just absolutely fantastic! The movie is very complex which is good and boosts up the film to a high degree. I wanted to see more of these characters and what happens next in the film. I wasn't to much of a fan of the ending to be honest. Not just it's complex, it's uncertain and doesn't have a real explanation. It expands your mind for a explanation for a movie but endings like that for me I truly dislike. Overall, 'Birdman' is a once in a lifetime movie that you'll encounter and be so amazed from it that it will think about how good it is. The movie is remember ably and raw. I'm going to give 'Birdman' an HIGH A+ (98%) grading!",

Ultimately the central protagonist is the only character I was following as the secondary characters, who have depth and their own side stories, are all but abandoned in the second and third acts in order to conclude the man vs self arc.

As much as Michael Keaton's return is being praised.  And he is good in this.  I think Edward Norton and Zach Galifianakis at times kind of steal the show.  Very interesting camera angles.  The camera allows you to track the characters through each scene.  Certainly this will be given many Oscar nominations.  My only complaint is that it did seem to go on a little long.  It seemed 15 to 20 minutes too long.  I was waiting for the movie to reach it's conclusion at that time and really began to loose interest.

What I liked about it was that someone's finally taking on the superhero flicks with some thought and depth, looking at their place in our culture in a way that's really interesting. What I didn't like about it was that it was just too busy and over-the-top in almost every way, too fussy and confusing and ultimately not sure what it wanted to say.

            "content": "'Strange' is the game when it comes to Birdman.\n\nThe famed long scenes start off having a significant impact on the feel of Birdman. For the first third of the film, I felt like I was watching a play on screen. Everything in front of my eyes felt so real, and I felt like I could almost feel the actors shuffling behind me to get into position for their next part in the 30 or 40 minute shot. This, along with how the first act took place in one confined setting, made for an excellent portrayal of the theater, and I loved it. Sadly, I soon got used to the lack of cuts. By the end of the movie had almost completely forgotten that this movie was doing something different with its cuts, which took away a bit of the fun.\n\nThe cinematography added to Birdman's unique feel. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Emmanuel Lubezki pushed the camera into some very interesting spaces that really changed the feeling, emotion, and emphasis of certain scenes. Birdman deserved it's Oscar for Best Cinematography.\n\nThe social commentary in this movie is heavy and relevant, and frankly, the best part of the film. Birdman has Riggan (Michael Keaton) dealing with his role as an actor and family in a very melodramatic fashion. Riggan's struggles give off points and arguments that are very meaningful in this cinema climate of superheroes and blockbusters. The way our protagonist interacts and deals with the other actors, who all appear to represent current Hollywood stereotypes, gives more social commentary. The acute nuances are what drive the film, and get you through the boring parts.\n\nThe rising action didn't rise, but instead stayed at a mostly constant level of action. It could feel somewhat stagnant, yet, somewhat compelling at the same time. Very 'strange,' and difficult to describe. I postulate that the long scenes added to the second act feeling slow but interesting.\n\nParts of Birdman seem intentionally ambiguous, which is fine, but I would really like to know some of the exact details after my time with Riggan. I would highly recommend Birdman to everyone, even if just for them to experience Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's unique take on film making.",

I truly believe he'll win the Oscar for best actor. Edward Norton who plays an actor that nobody really likes and is such a jerk delivers an award worthy performance as well and I believe is a shoe-in for a supporting actor nomination. Emma Stone who plays Keaton's messed up teenage daughter also delivers the best performance of her career so far and is possibly a nominee for supporting actress. Naomi Watts, Lindsay Duncan, and Zach Galifianakis also deliver great performances. One thing interesting about the film is that they say it's a comedy but the truth is it's not at all a comedy. It's heavy, dramatic, intense, though it has a few funny moments. It's a film that'll leave you hanging asking yourself what happened in the end. This film will hit Oscar season for sure.

It has much to say about the culture we live in now and how it warps our priorities so that we focus on nothing more than the best way we can be adored. \"Birdman\" explores this with scenes of both over-the-top comedy and heart-wrenching drama. What REALLY sets \"Birdman\" apart is that it can have such a daring, albeit bizarre, style and structure, and yet its innovations do not distract because all weirdness is absorbed so deftly through the performances, particularly by Emma Stone, Edward Norton, and of course, the Birdman himself, the dynamite Michael Keaton. His performance as Riggin Thompson is, to me, despite all of the character's oddball misfortunes and eccentricities, like Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders. And Inarittu's direction, along with Lubezki's swirling cinematography, help us feel that weight that Riggin is carrying. All in all, every facet of the film was fascinating, skillful, and refreshingly original. \"Birdman\", from quite early on in its two hour run, peeled back my lips for a dumb-euphoric smile not only because it was funny and entertaining (and it was!) but also because I was genuinely moved.

Michael Keaton stars as Riggan, a washed up movie star once famous for playing an iconic superhero, Birdman, 20 years ago. Facing an existential mid-life crisis, Riggan takes it upon himself to write, star and direct a Broadway play adaptation in order to kickstart his faded career, but mostly to prove to himself that he's still relevant.\n\nKeaton delivers a stunning performance as a deeply conflicted actor/father/husband burdened by his own ego (or is that alter-ego?). The film also features really terrific supporting performances from Edward Norton as a nutty, self-center method stage actor, and Emma Stone as Riggan's frequently neglected and recently rehabbed daughter, and Zach Galifianakis pops up every now and again as Riggan's high-strung production partner who seems on the edge of his own breakdown.\n\nBut as great as this ensemble cast is, perhaps the real star of Birdman is the film's dazzling camerawork by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, which consists of several long tracking shots seamlessly blended to create the illusion that the film was shot in one continuous take. Lubezki, who won an Oscar last year for shooting Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Gravity makes that film seem like a walk in the park compared to the high-wire work on display here. While this might sound like a gimmick, after 15 minutes of this 119 minute feature, the effect actually elevates the restless nature of the film's narrative; helping to blur the line between reality and fantasy. When Riggan's grip on sanity slips further away and confesses he hasn't slept in days, we not only sense it in Keaton's performance, but also feel that relentless exhaustion through Lubezki's camera, which never quits.\n\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu's film is a tragi-comedy about life, love, passion, ego, career, centered by a man who just might not be content with being merely just a man, and the jokes often land with a cold sting. It's ambiguous ending is very bittersweet and has been rolling around inside my head for days, and perhaps because of this it's hard for me to not think of the word \"masterpiece\" when describing the wonderfully bonkers fantasia that is Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance).

His current girlfriend is pregnant, his ex-wife wants him to tend to their ex-druggie daughter, and his newest actor Mike Shiner (Norton) is a jerk/diva who likes to mess with other people for the hell of it.

            "content": "Expecting a comedy from Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu would have preposterous. The man was known for his cinema verite of suffering, notably Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful, and his best film, Amores Perros, roughly translated to Love's a Bitch. Perhaps there isn't much of a shift going from tragedy to comedy. Inarritu's newest film, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), has been wowing critics and audiences alike, building deafening awards buzz for its cast, Iarritu, and the superb cinematography, but will it fly with mainstream audiences? This may be one of the weirdest Oscar front-runners in some time.\n\nRiggan (Michael Keaton) is an actor best known for playing the superhero Birdman in the early 1990s and walking away from the franchise. He's still haunted by that role (sometimes literally) and struggling to prove himself as an artist. He's brokered all his money into directing, adapting, and starring in a theatrical version of Raymond Carver's short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\" The show is in previews and about to open its run on Broadway but it's already got a rash of problems. The leading man needs to be replaced immediately. The supposed savior is famous actor Mike (Edward Norton), an undeniably talented but temperamental actor who pushes buttons to find some fleeting semblance of \"truth.\" Mike's girlfriend, Lesley (Naomi Watts), is growing tired of his antics and desperate for her own long-delayed big break. Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is Riggan's \"girlfriend\" and co-star and may be pregnant. Sam (Emma Stone), Riggan's personal assistant and also his detached daughter, is fresh from rehab, and spiteful against her neglectful dad. Toss in Riggan's best friend/manager/play producer (Zach Galifianakis), Riggan's ex-wife (Amy Ryan), and a feared theater critic (Lindsay Duncan) who is determined to kill Riggan's show to send a message to the rest of Hollywood polluting the integrity of the theat-tah. Oh, and throughout all this, Riggan hears an ominous voice that alternating encourages him and humiliates him. \n\nIt's an industry satire, a bizarre comedy, a father/daughter drama, an examination on identity and the complicated pulls of affection and admiration, and a stunning virtuoso technical achievement. As a movie, Birdman is hard to pin down or categorize. It's a movie that you definitely need to experience on your own rather than have described (don't stop reading, come back...), and that is a reason enough to see the film, a rare aspect among modern movies. It's an artistically offbeat movie and yet it ultimately is about one has been actor looking back on his career and coming to terms with his own impact with pop-culture, art, and his family. It's about a man struggling to find his place in his own life, beset at all odds by doubters and traitors and obstructionists. The refreshing aspect about Riggan is that he's a has-been but not a sad sack; he's fighting from the beginning, sometimes pathetically and sometimes in vain, but the man is always fighting to regain his dignity, to reclaim his life's narrative, and to fight for his legacy. Riggan, after all, set the stage for the modern superhero industry that currently dominates Hollywood bean counters. He was too just soon, and the parallels with Keaton (Batman) are superficially interesting but there's more of an original character here than a reflection of the actor playing him. He's neurotic, egotistical, hungry, and fighting for respect, like many actors, and the film flirts with the fa\u00e7ades people inhabit. Many of the characters are emotionally needy, desperate for validation wherever they can find it. \n\nAnother strength of the film is that it finds a moment for each of its talented ensemble players to shine, chief among them Keaton. The actor hasn't had a showcase like this in some time and he is a terrific guiding force to hold the entire story together. Whether it's marching in his tighty whities or working through his complicated degrees of neuroses, Keaton is alive in a way that is electrifying. We see several highs and lows over the course of two hours, some moments making us cheer on Riggan and others making us wince, but he comes across more like a person than just the butt of a joke. It's also just fun to watch him adopt different acting styles when he steps on stage, including one early on where he's purposely too stilted. It's so comforting to watch Norton (The Grand Budapest Hotel) get to be great again, not just good but great. Early on, you see the appeal of Mike, his allure, and Norton keeps pushing the audience, as well as the characters, back and forth with his wealth of talent. Stone (Amazing Spider-Man 2) spends most of the film as the sulky daughter but she gets to uncork one awesomely angry monologue against her loser dad. The thawing father/daughter relationship ends up supplying the film with its only degree of heart. Watts (The Impossible) is comically frazzeled for the majority of her time but gets a memorable character beat where she breaks down in tears, realizing her dream of \"making it\" might never materialize. Riseborough (Oblivion) also has moments where he sadness and vulnerability cut deep. The supporting characters aren't terribly deep but they all have a moment to standout. \n\nIt's a decidedly offbeat film that dips into the surreal though never dives completely inside. The movie is rather ambiguous about whether or not the fantastical flourishes are a result of Riggan being mentally ill, or at the least overtaxed with stress. Is there really a Birdman or is it a voice in his head, a manifestation of his ego or a ghost to remind him of the past when he was a star? Does Riggan really have the powers he seems to believe he does, including the ability to make objects move with his mind? Innaritu playfully keeps the audience guessing, treating the bizarre in an offhand manner reminiscent of magic realism. The bizarre embellishments blend smoothly with the film's darkly comic tone. It's a funny movie but one that you laugh at between clenched teeth. \n\nIs it all the unblinking camerawork a gimmick? I don't think so. While the story can engage with its weirdness and surreal unpredictability, the long tracking shots bring a heightened reality to the unreal, they bring a larger sense of awe to the proceedings, watching to see the magic trick pulled off to the end. If anything, it's an extra thrill to the script and greatly compounds the artic audaciousness of the film, but I think it also channels the live-wire energy of theater, of watching actors have to walk that tightrope of performance and blocking, weaving together to pull off the ensemble. It makes the film medium feel more like live theater. Thematically I think the style also connects to the anxious mentality of Riggan. In the end, I don't truly care that much whether it's a gimmick or not (though I vote it is not) because the camerawork is rapturous. Made to resemble an entire two-hour tracking shot, it is a joyous thrill to watch these technical wizards do their thing, to watch the best in the business perform a visual magic trick over the duration of two hours. Even if you don't care for the overall movie you can at least be entertained by the imaginative and thoroughly accomplished cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, fresh from his Oscar for Gravity and who should be clearing shelf space for the next bushel of awards he's destined to win with this film. It's an intoxicating experience to behold, though the film is structured into 10-minute or so chunks for feasibility. If you want to watch a real cinematic magic trick, check out the film Russian Ark, which is an entire movie, performed in one uncut single tracking shot. \n\nI'm still wrestling with the debate over whether Birdman is an artistically ambitious romp or a truly great movie. Much like the characters in the film, I'm wrestling with whether I have confused my admiration with adoration. It's a movie that I feel compelled to see a second time, and maybe a third, just to get a handle on my overall thoughts and feelings. That may be a sign that Birdman is a film for the ages, or maybe it's just a sign that it's not as approachable and denied a higher level of greatness by its obtuseness. Inarritu's surreal showbiz satire is plenty entertaining, darkly comic, and a technical marvel thanks to the brilliant camerawork. The percussion-heavy musical score is another clever choice, naturally adding more urgency and anxiety to the proceedings. Birdman is a strange and beguiling movie, one that deserves to be seen, needs to be experienced, and stays with you rolling around in your brain. That sounds like a winner to me. \n\nNate's Grade: A",

I think\nfilms like \"Life is Beautiful\", \"The English Patient\" and \"Juno\" played both screens at this fine\ntheatre for a time.\n\nThough I knew nothing about \"Birdman\" starring Michael Keaton, Naomi Watts and Edward\nNorton, I just assumed it had to be darn good to demand both screens. Before hitting\nthe theatre, I did a quick look on moviefone.com for a rating, and it was just 3 our of 5 stars.\nThen I asked the long time clerk at the theatre and he said response has been mixed.\n\nSo I wasn't too optimistic but for $6 bucks plus Naomi Watts and Edward Norton in the\nmix, it had to be good right?\n\nThis movie sailed totally over my head. Sort of like a wacky Coen Brothers movie, I just\ndidn't get it. Keaton, who in the movie, is a box office dynamo as the lead in \"Birdman\"\n(a sci-fi action hero a la Spiderman). Wanting to break the stereotype, he tries his\nhand at Broadway and not only is the lead and the director, but also funder the show.\n\nWhile he tries to journey towards live theatre success, his \"inner birdman\" voice and\nbuddy, keeps whispering advise to return to his tried and true character and make like\n\"Birdman 6\". Plus Keaton struggles with an ex-wife, a recovering daughter and nuts\nco-lead (Norton) and more.\n\nThis movie just made no sense to me. If I used adjectives like weird, obscure, confusing\nand dark, I'd be barely touching the surface. Folks, I did not like this movie at all. To\nme, it put the \"P\" in pointless....save your $.\n\n(Note - now that I've written this review, I went to copy and paste it onto\nRottentomatoes.com (which I always do) and was SHOCKED to see huge, very\npositive rating #'s from both critics and audience viewers alike. Now I'm\ntotally confused. I didn't fall asleep in this movie at all hoping beyond hope that\nthe film would right itself..but it didn't. I'm totally bewildered that some many\nfolks like it so much.\n\nNot for me.",

But his casting in Tim Burton's Batman was a career turning point that made him a worldwide star for all ages. He would reprised the role in Batman Returns but dropped from the rest of the series, just like Sean Connery left Bond's franchise: to pursue new horizons and go where he had not gone before.\n\nNone of his efforts after Batman proved as successful as the superhero series (which is still the rule in Hollywood nowadays) so he slowly vanished from the minds of his audiences, and has been completely unknown to the new ones.\n\nSo it's a no-brainer that revered Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu offered him the role of Riggan Thomson, a washed-up Hollywood actor who is about to revive his career by directing, acting and adapting Raymond Carver's short story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love for Broadway. The role asks for an aging man haunted by his long gone superhero persona and the everyday insecurities of actors confronted with success, recognition and relevance and Keaton brings a helpful baggage to the plate, even if he proclaims this is the most dissimilar character he's ever played.\n\nTo read the full review, go to http://www.examiner.com/review/birdman-or-the-unexpected-virtue-of-ignorance-a-best-picture-of-2014-contende?CID=examiner_alerts_article",

I'm a lover of the theatre, particularly the Broadway stage, so it's no surprise that the film, in all its disturbing glory and darkness, is right up my alley.  There's a lot of substance and subtext to be discovered if one is able to look at the screen long enough to witness the mental horror and anguish that occupies the cast of conceited,  amoral and jaded characters that occupy the stage in an effort to leave a mark with fans and critics alike,  Michael Keaton plays a desperate, washed-up, ex-movie star, most famous for BIRDMAN, his superhero role in a trilogy twenty years back.  Now in a frantic effort to make a legitimate move to save his career he must battle his lifelong demons that have so far plagued his id.  But in mounting a New York play about love as his own labour of love, Keaton's character must also confront and battle the people he loves, those who love him and even those who will do just about anything to stay on top of the game.  It's a game of survival to the bitter end. The Broadway stage comes across as a terminal station in the world of ambition and hope. There's a fiery take-no-prisoners approach found in every person of the theatre, including the crucial, indispensable critic.  That Keaton's BIRDMAN ultimately makes it on stage and then soars only affirms that the theatre, even if magical, is not for the faint of heart and that actors are a messed-up, desperate lot.  It also confirms that Hollywood has served up yet another dark, self-critical portrayal that begs to ask us mere mortals why we become so fascinated with the glamourous world of celebrity if we realize that they are far more troubled than we will ever be.",

            "content": "Birdman is shot and edited in such a way that it appears to be a single take throughout 90% of the film. It tells the story of Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton) a former superstar of a superhero franchise known as Birdman. He has since washed up and is out to prove he was more than just a lycra bird suit and big action scenes. To do this he is writing, directing, producing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. The production hits speedbumps along the way to opening night and Riggan has a series of mental speedbumps as well.\n\nThings I Liked:\n\nMichael Keaton and Edward Norton. These two guys tear it up throughout this movie. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but there is this one fairly early on where it's just the two of them rehearsing on stage and the moment they let the characters go you suddenly realize that you have gotten drawn in and are glued to the screen. They both deliver monsterous performances and create incredibly interesting and multidimensional characters. Unbelievable.\n\nThe Cinematography. There is a reason that Emmanuel Lubezki has two cinematography oscars. He's phenomenal at his job. The movie, like I said, is shot to appear as though it is a single take that flows through space and time. The movie has a beautiful look and uses both intense chaos and absolute stillness to the greatest of effects. The movie uses sets that create the cramped backstage atmosphere of the St. James Theatre and really makes you feel like a fly on the wall because there is no wiggle room to move around these sets.\n\nThe Score. The soundtrack to this movie is absolutely perfect. A combination of over the top classical pieces and freestyle jazz drums. The sweeping score moments are mostly to accompany Riggan's high moments and the times when he is truly feeling on top of the world, the drums are to assist with his inner conflict and the conflict of the show as it falls apart at the seams. The score isn't usually something that stands out to me in movies but this one added so much that it is hard to ignore.\n\nThings I Didn't Like:\n\nNothing Really. I was transfixed by this movie the first time I got out of this. I caught numerous moments and subtle things I missed from the first time. The third time I watched it I was over come with excitement. I haven't found a moment I was taken away, a problem, line readings I didn't like, characters I felt were unnecessary. This movie is an experience that drags you along and you can't let go until those credits roll because you WILL miss something if you aren't paying attention.\n\nOverall. Overall, Birdman was a reminder of how amazing movies can be. It was a reminder that there are still original things that can come out of Hollywood. It was a reminder that actors who you had written off can come back and astound you multiple times. And for me personally, it's an excuse to indulge all of my interests: theatre, film, superheroes, music, etc. It's an experience. And one I am happy to take part in multiple times over.",

I probably did the wrong thing in that I tried to count all the times the takes ended (I counted 6 or 7), so that meant I wasn't completely immersed in the world of Birdman, but that's okay.

The writing, acting, direction, music, cinematography -- OH GOD, THE CINEMATOGRAPHY -- everything about this movie comes together to tell a riveting, deeply emotional story about self-doubt that is probably more universal than most people would like to admit. The characters are larger than life, but played with such empathy and panache as to make human flaws like self-loathing and narcissism endearing and relatable. \n\nEvery scene, every moment is bursting at the seems with tension and real human drama. Doesn't hurt that the movie is also incredibly funny.

The assertion of Emma Stone's individuality to Keaton is a very memorable moment and definitely a demo reel piece for anyone to accomplish. My problem with the film is the writing.

He was overlooked for films such as \"Clean and Sober\" and \"My Life.\"  It is also hard to watch him here, and not think of \"Batman.\"  Every time they mentioned \"Birdman\" in the film, I heard in my head, \"Batman,\" instead.  Michael's performance reminded me of Mickey Rourke's performance in \"The Wrestler\" and Jeff Bridges's performance in \"Crazy Heart.\" All of those films, deals with a star, who has fallen from glory seeking redemption and one last shot to stardom. Keaton's performance here is both hilarious and will make you cry.\n\nThe film has a unique style that some audiences might not like. The entire film feels like one big long take without any cuts. The editing here is amazing and should win for Best Editing.  The style in my opinion, grabs the audience into the shoes and the mindset of Keaton's character. Some audiences might not like that, and prefer a straightforward style to tell the story. However, I praise Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu for choosing to do this daring style to tell the story.\n\nThe story makes me think of the late George Reeves, of how he didn't want to be typecast as Superman and be viewed as a serious actor.  The film also comments about superhero movies and the public's opinions about them.  The film reminded me of movies like The Wrestler, Black Swan, Crazy Heart, The Artist, The Player, Bullets Over Broadway, and Hollywoodland. The ending seems open-ended and ambiguous that will definitely keep the audience talking after the film is done.\n\nBesides Keaton, Ed Norton, the former Incredible Hulk, is very good here and a great foil and antagonist to Keaton. He is so over the top, it is hilarious.  He should get a nomination for Supporting Actor.  Emma Stone, Gwen Stacy of Spiderman, is also really good as Keaton's daughter. Her scenes with Keaton reminded me of the scenes in The Wrestler between Mickey Rourke and Evan Rachel Wood. I would love to see Stone get nomination for Supporting Actress for the film. Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis, Amy Ryan, and Andrea Riseborough provide solid supporting work here.\n\nI definitely recommend this film and I hope that Michael Keaton finally gets nominated and wins a best actor Oscar for the film.

The feeling of not being able to comment, yell, or express any kind of excitement about what was happening on the screen, because I was watching it in a public place, and it would have been inappropriate. Yes, Birdman was that great. \nStarting with the bewildering cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (who else?). Thanks to his amazing work, Birdman looks like ONE continuous shot, and that's beyond genius.\nThe cast left me speechless. Michael Keaton's performance as the washed-up blockbuster actor was incredible. Through his performance we see a character unable to connect with his present self by not forgetting his past. Nostalgia, desperation, feelings of being forgotten, and the ridiculousness of his acts, were all conveyed by his amazing performance. I'm expecting him to be the next Best Actor Oscar winner. Edward Norton also gave an amazing performance, which is really great because the last memorable performance he gave was in American History X in 1998. Emma Stone and Naomi Watts are amazing as well. Basically, I want to see all of them nominated.\nBirdman is one of my favorite films of the year so far, and I'm so happy that it was directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu, because he keeps surprising me with every movie he makes. Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel, and Biutiful are all amazing in their own ways. Birdman is no exception; it is originality, uniqueness, spectacle, and awesomeness all packed in the same film. Expect it to be a strong contender for the Oscars this year.",

            "content": "\"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige \"\nA delightful piece of cinematographic art, Birdman is a polarizing movie one would either love or hate. Or pretend to like it due to the overall hype surrounding it, even if he/she cannot get.  An emotional exploration zigzagging between sharp humor and hard-to-chew drama this is a magnificent philosophic and existential story. A personal journey of a troubled character, this delivery becomes an experience which the audience gladly shares and enjoys.\nThe story is about an age-ing actor who has never found his right place on the screen. Riggan (Michael Keaton), famous for his Birdman superhero roles, has always aspired to prove himself on Broadway. In a final grasp to set, to direct and to act in his own Broadway \"baby\" he risks everything he has gained throughout his acting career: financial assets, image and family. As he struggles with the preparations for the premiere and the co-operation with his team, he needs to fight countless concept battles with his talented but disgusting , alcohol-addicted on stage partner Mike (Edward Norton), to build-up a bridge to his somehow estranged daughter and to face the biggest challenge of his life: himself.\nLoud, bold and hugely ambitious, every detail in Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's story is provocative and superb. It is as if the story develops on the edge of a sharp razor and might crash and disappoint in every moment. None of this happens and the audience remains mesmerized throughout every single battle of Riggan with his internal demons, with his fears, unfulfilled dreams; with his family, stage partners and critics. Below the heavily philosophical and existential content, there is an underlying hint (or actually a criticism) towards the current state of film-making and acting, but few would note this in the movie simply because everyone would find its own part that impresses him/her most.  I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's delivery contains something special and personal for everyone. You could find a line, a monologue or a dialogue that would touch you, provoke you and stun you. Sometimes it comes out of nowhere, just like the ruthless, realistic and eye-opening monologue Riggan's daughter (Emma Stone) when she quarrels with her father over a cigarette of weed. Or the Edward Norton's one-liner: \"\"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige \".\nOn top of the delightful content, Birdman pleases with its brilliant technical presentation, including 8th Cinematography nomination for Emmanuel Lubezki and why not a second Oscar, and spectacularly long and continuous camera takes. These single takes require getting the best of your actors and director  I\u00f1\u00e1rritu has definitely managed to squeeze out every single drop of talent from his cast. There is hardly anyone that could match Michael Keaton's performance for the Best Male Act at the Oscars this year. Complex, emotional, disturbed and simply astonishing, Michael Keaton delivers a lifetime performance. Even the impressive Edward Norton, who seems to dominate with his presence in the beginning of the movie, is outshined by Norton as Riggan. In the end, one would wonder whether Keaton is the reason for Birdman being such a delight!\nIn conclusion, Birdman is a must see delivery! Even if it fails at the Oscars it has already become a contemporary classic that would be mentioned as a benchmark for remarkable film-making and acting by many. It is true that all the hype surrounding it has attracted many mainstream viewers, who blink at the final credits and wonder what is so special about this movie. So it must be also said that Birdman is not an experience for everyone, just for those who perceive film-making, cinematographic experience and exquisite acting as something intimate.",

            "content": "How do you even begin to discuss a film like this? For starters, I've heard many use the term \"tour de force,\" when referring to this majestic piece of cinema. I guess that's about as appropriate as you can get. In fact, BIRDMAN or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), is the very damn definition of a tour de force. The movie is an exhilarating leap forward from an already impressive disposition for director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and his star, Michael Keaton. The film follows Riggan Thomson, an actor struggling to shake off the identity of the superhero he played twenty years ago (sound familiar?), as he attempts to rejuvenate his career through directing, writing, and starring in his own stage adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story. Thomson must eventually face the fact that he lives in a world where audiences only make you a star if you have the most YouTube views, the most Twitter followers, or, maybe, if you sign your soul away to some big-business comic book production company, such as Marvel (cough cough, Robert Downey Jr., cough cough). The journey leading to opening night is a fantastical one, lucidly exhibiting Riggan's struggle with not only his ego, but his family, his crumbling career, and his telepathic abilities (yeah, you heard me correctly). We never get a concrete response from the director whether some of the more supernatural elements of the film are real or imaginary, as we only receive contradicting clues along the way, but what's it matter anyway? Whether Riggan does in fact possess divine abilities is hardly at stake. The parallel is clear - Riggan's powers correlate strongly with what the film does best: parading, comprehensively, the indisputable superpowers of its cast and crew members; Keaton giving an Oscar-worthy execution of acting; its cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, whose love of the long-take is ever so present here (and never has been more effective); and its director. Birdman is brilliant on an astounding number of levels. It's layered, complexly and intimately, with so many in-jokes and small nudges. Not only is it a technical showcase, much like last year's Gravity (also shot by Lubezki), but in contrast, it actually features a meaty, ultra-meta story, with some truly remarkable, mostly haunting, performances along the way. But, what am I saying? These sentences I'm spewing out are all just labels... Labels, labels, labels. All I can say is, go see this damn movie.",

Foxcatcher) it wasn't strictly limited to just enticing the Academy. Birdman is an experience in the truest sense of the word. Whether it be the stellar performances or absolutely astonishing cinematography, the film always has something going for it in every scene. The symbolism is countless, and the whole \"what is real acting\" is a bit heavy-handed. But, the movie succeeds on its devotion to showcasing the mind of Riggan and his downward spiral down a path of mental instability that starts to make the audience even question what is reality and what is imagination. This dichotomy pervades through the plot in such a seamless matter that everything somehow culminates into this fantastically surreal dark comedy. \n\nI truly did enjoy this film much more than I expected. The incessant jazz score in the background is so subtly perfect that you almost just get lost in the rhythm. On face value though, I still 100% believe that Boyhood should've won Best Picture, but I really don't have a problem with Birdman snatching it away... it is too good of a film to knock. Great job.",

            "content": "http://expletivedleted.livejournal.com/228350.html\n\nI put off this post because I didn't want to write it in the middle of a blogging marathon. Since it was just a unique and incredible film (in the running for my fave of the year), I wanted to do it justice with a clear and awake head, so I thought I could find that time within the couple of days that my marathons were auto-posting. Oops.\n\nBirdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, centers around Michael Keaton as Riggan Thompson. Back in the day, Riggan led the popular Birdman franchise. He eventually gave up the role, and his career spiraled ever since. In a last ditch effort to get his life and career on track, he's eyeing Broadway. The film begins with the night before the first preview of the show which he has written, directed, and stars in and leads up to the hopeful opening night. Besides the usual drama that comes along with opening a show (difficult actors, budget constraints, short timelines, etc), he's got his own personal demons to wrestle with, most of which are manifest by the voice of Birdman that is always in his head.\n\nI don't know if I can even count all the reasons I loved this movie. There was just so much that felt like it was a present just for me. I'll be honest. This one is kinda weird. Okay, very weird. Not everyone will get it. God knows there's a lot that I had to shrug off and just go with. But if you can suspend disbelief for two hours and let the Birdman fly, it's well worth it.\n\nI started to write down \"first thing that's jumping out at me\" but then three thoughts hit me at once and I couldn't decide which to start with. Umm, okay, the theatre part of everything. I loe theatre. I've been involved in many shows and seen countless others. I make trips down to NYC every so often and see as much Broadway as I can, to the point where I know midtown NYC better than a good friend who lives in the city. So of course it was great to be able to follow the action within a Broadway show, getting to see behind the scenes and how some of the last minute drama that I'm all to familiar with plays out. There's one detail about it that got me excited beyond all reason. The real life Broadway theater they used is the St James. That's where American Idiot played. I was there 9 times for that show. I wrote my name on the lobby wall (it was a thing for Idiot). I recognized all of the sights outside when we viewed the street, and I relished each shot of backstage, getting to see where all the magic of my obsession came together. If there was any venue I would have wanted to see that way, this would have been it.\n\nAs we trekked thru the theater and the nearby city, there was some incredible cinematography at play. Think about any movie you watch. How many times do you see cuts? Prolly every few seconds or so (less if it's a Michael Bay flick). You cut from one side of the conversation to another. You cut between scenes. You cut and pick up when someone changes locations. Not so in Birdman. The idea was to make it all seem like one long dream-like shot. There was about ten minutes between each cut, and the ones that were there were masked to create a flow. The effect was unreal. Each piece had to be precisely choreographed so that entrances matched with the long tracking shots down twisty corridors. Then you had to hope that no one messed up their lines, or it would have had to start all over. \n\nBut oh, these actors were up to the task, leading some of the SERIOUS Oscar buzz (some are predicting as many as 10 nods total) for this film. I'll just make a blanket statement about the difficulty with the long shots that I just mentioned. Clearly, they all kept up. Michael Keaton had the role of a lifetime. Of course, everyone is drawing the Batman/Birdman connection, but aside from that, Keaton claims Riggan Thompson is the farthest removed from himself of any character he's ever played. Currently, he is the man to beat this year, and its not hard to see why. \n\nAnd as a front runner in the supporting category, we've got my boy Edward Norton. To be honest, in the past couple years, his status as my fave actor was starting to fade. Not that I had anyone to replace him (Tom Hanks? Christian Bale? Channing Tatum?), but it had been so long since the days where his films allowed him performances that floored me. Birdman brought it all back. As Mike Shriner, the last minute replacement actor brought in just in time for the first preview, Norton gets to shine in a number of ways. He's got some dramatic moments, as you find out some of the inner turmoil he goes thru, but he also has some great comedic moments. Shriner's antics know no bounds, and Norton relishes in the chance to play them up. We've only seen Norton do comedy a couple times before (Death to Smoochy, Keeping the Faith), but he excels at it, and I wish he'd do more. And getting a chance to combine both ends of the spectrum of his immense skills is such a treat. Of course, any time his name is mentioned even remotely close to Oscar, I'm in his corner. I really hope this is his year. He shoulda had it 15 years ago for American History X. Birdman shows off an even more versatile and nuanced performance.\n\nEmma Stone is also garnering some supporting buzz as Riggan's daughter Sam, currently hired as his assistant to keep her out of trouble and in recovery. She still manages to find some trouble. A much darker turn than we've ever really seen from her, but with that same spark of mischief in those big eyes. Another worth mentioning is Zach Galifianakis. Usually, I can only take so much of his awkward comedy. Turns out, he doesn't need to hide behind it. He had a few moments of frantic energy, but didn't cross into that awkward territory he's known for. I loved seeing him in a serious role, and really want to see more of that. Huh, it's the inverse of Norton's situation. Cool. Other notable names: Naomi Watts, Merritt Weaver, Amy Ryan, and prolly others that may mean more to you than me. I was describing this movie to someone, and as I usually do, I lead with the cast. Their reaction was something like \"What?! How have I not heard of this movie! I love all those people and I don't even care what it's about I have to see it!\" Yes. Yes you do have to see this.\n\nBirdman - \\m/ \\m/ \\m/ \\m/\n\nhttp://www.expletivedleted.com\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted\nhttp://www.facebook.com/expletivedleted",

Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has directed a film that is technically engaging, funny, energetic, poignant, and filled with universally outstanding performances. I highly recommend it.  \n-----The film takes place almost entirely in the St. James theatre on Broadway. Here Riggan Thompson has written, directed, and is starring in a theatrical adaptation of Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, is a washed-up Hollywood actor famous for having starred in the Birdman superhero films twenty years previously. Two decades on he is desperate to re-start his career with his Broadway show. The show is a few days from opening night, and before it opens Riggan must deal with an antagonistic actor, hateful critics, public ridicule, his fractured private life, and his own crushing self-doubts. Meanwhile all of his insecurities and doubts literally speak to him in the voice of Birdman, and he may or may nor have telekinetic powers. In the end Riggan may pay for his newfound success with his sanity. \n-----The performances in Birdman are universally brilliant, especially from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone. Riggan Thompson is a man terrified of being irrelevant, and torn between his desire to be famous and loved and his desire to be truly artistically fulfilled. It's one of the best roles Keaton has ever had, and he wonderfully leads the ensemble cast. The best, however, is Edward Norton, who gives the best performance I've seen all year. He plays Mike Shiner, clearly the best actor in the show. But while he achieves perfect truth onstage, he is incapable of being honest offstage. Antagonizing everyone around him and just being a terrible human being, Mike is an obnoxious character, and Edward Norton plays him perfectly. Then there's Emma Stone who plays Sam, Riggan's daughter, and the only person Mike acts honestly with. Emma Stone plays off Norton as well as he does off her, and their scens are among the highlights of the film. Though Michael Keaton is the clear lead, he backed up every step of the way by the entire supporting ensemble. \n-----Birdman gives us a unique look into the world of Broadway theatre. The film is presented in one massve  tracking shot that winds through the hallways and rooms of the St James. This gives a bold and kinetic view into the lives of these various characters as they attempt to put on this play. The script is witty, insightful, and full of clever dialogue. Which is why it so frustrating when, in the third act, the film starts to be so overtly symbolic and metaphorical that it threatens to derail the momentum gathered by the first hour and a half of the film. As of now I have seen Birdman twice and I am still unable to figure out the underlying meaning, if there is any, of these surreal moments. Perhaps the problem lies with me instead of the film, but these moments, more than anything else, are what hold the film back for me.  \n-----Birdman is the best film I've seen this year, despite these frustrations. It asks many interesting questions about the nature of fame versus prestige, and the balance between being a celebrity and being an actor. Through its ensemble of interesting characters it tackles the nature of why we do art, and this exploration is ultimately a joyful one. I rarely have so much fun at the cinema.",

            "content": "A well-written movie, with superb acting and phenomenal directing will usually get 4 and a half stars from me.  To get 5, it needs to be that one element more special than just a fantastic movie.  It has to be unique or a different perspective on a previously tackled subject.  \"Birdman\"  (or \"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\") fits that description and gets 5 stars only because it cannot get more.  Every movie starts with a story.  The story portrayed here is flawless.  It is a brilliant story written in such a dark, nonsensical way, yet anchored with so much dialogue that 2 hours zooms by as the viewer tries hard to absorb it.  It's the kind of story that leaves you talking about it, reading more about it and wanting to watch it again just to be sure you got it all.  In that sense, it was perfect.  To execute all of that dialogue, the casting and acting had to be perfect, and I see no way it could have been done more perfectly.  The attraction to the initial construct of the story centers around a seemingly washed-up actor who, 20 years removed from his heyday, is seeking to be both respected as an actor and appreciated by the fans who left him long ago.  However, as all good stories will include, the irony is, the meat of the story is not truly about that at all. Sure, it is peripherally, but the point of the film is about so much more than that.  So, on the surface, getting Michael Keaton to play a role that is meant to lure audiences in thinking that the comparison to Michael's character, Riggin, and Michael himself is what the movie is about, but instead the audiences will be fed so much more.  And to do that not only takes excellent writing, but also solid casting and acting.  \"Birdman\" also perfectly does this.  Since the majority of the film is about the pretension of acting as a whole, both in celebrity-driven Hollywood as well as the self-importance of the Broadway theater scene, it was vital to cast actors who have done both and can seriously, yet ironically, play those kinds of characters.  Emma Stone and the brilliant Edward Norton solidify the execution of this story in a way that makes it so fun to absorb the deluge of dialogue in this 2-hour film.  That brings us to directing.  The gasoline in this machine, which relies heavily on how the acting carries out the dialogue and story, is rooted strongly in how the camera and direction guide the audience cinematically through it.  The dizzying, sometimes frantic, pace of the camera work and the perception of a 2-hour single-shot film, is the main reason the acting and script is able to be absorbed by the audience.  The chemistry of all of these elements are done so perfectly, that 4.5 stars was an easy award.  What put \"Birdman\" over the top, however, is the sheer absurdity of its subject matter.  The film is so schizophrenic, yet has to be in order to be coherent.  It's a dark comedy.  It's a drama.  It's an exquisite study into the minds of the type of people who become actors, why they get sucked into the field, what tortures them throughout their careers and, in the end, how they wrestle with the drama that has to be created in their own lives to even continue on such a seemingly-futile balance of integrity and popularity.  The definition of success as an actor is almost completely blurred.  Then to attempt to blend any success in that craft with success in real life is just impossible.  \"Birdman\" is such a farce, yet brilliantly constructed as an almost educational analysis of the industry that one walks out of the film simply amazed and nearly breathless trying to comprehend what had just been witnessed.  \"Birdman\" is what filmmaking is all about and what is so rarely seen.  It will be taught in universities for years.  It deserves Oscar recognition for directing, best acting, best supporting acting and screenplay.  It's just that good.",

The film is being herald as a movie making technical feat, acting at its best, plus definite Oscar nominations for Michael Keaton and Edward Norton in some of the lesser media oversell. I bought in to it!\n\nKeaton is a one time movie star who became famous playing the superhero Birdman who decides to come to Broadway in a play he has written, is producing, directing and is starring in for a comeback. Playing opposite is another film star (Naomi Watts) making her Broadway debut and Mike Shiner (Norton) a method actor who believes you use a real gun in a scene when he is going to be shot and drinking real gin on stage. Also involved is Laura (Andrea Riseborough), Keaton's sometime lover, his daughter Sam, (Emma Stone) just recently out of rehab being her Dad's assistant, his ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan) and his attorney Zach Galifianakis.\n\nIt has been described as a comedy/drama, a first rate back stage story but regarding the former I laughed once and as far as the latter comes nowhere near \"All About Eve\". There is one scene far fetched scene where The New York Times fictional critic, played by Lindsay Duncan, tells Keaton she will destroy his play, and him, for having the nerve to come to Broadway for his comeback.\n\nYes Keaton does a good job with what has to work with, Norton has some good moments but it is Emma Stone who makes the strongest impression.\n\nDirector Alejandro G. Inarritu, who co-wrote the film with Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo, also produced it. His gimmick, working with his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, making it seem like the movie, even though taking place over a few days, was filmed in one continuous take and is very successful at it. The music, mainly drumming by Antonio Sanchez, at times is affecting but most of the time annoying.\n\nI may wind up in the minority, and Keaton and Norton may get the Oscar nominations that are being talked about, but as a comedy or a drama or a satire \"Birdman\" doesn't rate a worth seeing from me.",

            "content": "The Mexican director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu has been making feature films since the year 2000, when his masterful triptych \"Amores Perros\" was released. Scripted by Guillermo Arriaga (who turned director, himself, in 2008, with the depressingly mediocre \"The Burning Plain\"), that movie followed three separate stories in Mexico City - all involving, in some way, dogs - as they intersected and diverged over the course of many months. Before turning to full-length films, Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had, like David Fincher before him, for years honed his craft on commercials, and his cinematic confidence as he juggled the many different threads of \"Amores Perros\" was a marvel to behold. What especially impressed was the fact that he wasn't all flash - con brio, e non con braggadocio - and that the stories had narrative weight and consequence.\n\nWhat followed were films equally as confident and similarly masterful - at least in terms of their mise-en-sc\u00e8ne - but much less meaningful. Both \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\" - written by Arriaga, as well - allowed Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu to continue to explore his love of multiple overlapping stories and fluid chronology, but when they reached their respective conclusions they revealed not much more than a naked emperor, fascinating as their cinematic trappings may have been. \"Biutiful,\" his next film, was made after he and Arriaga had a falling out, and it eschewed the focus on multiple protagonists to give us a hard look at one man (Javier Bardem) dying of cancer. An even bleaker movie than Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's earlier films, it featured a powerful central performance and much more straightforward camera and editing work than we had grown accustomed to. It was nice to see the director trying something new. Still, dark despair does not always equal profundity, and the film, though effective in certain scenes, managed to leave me cold in the face of death.\n\nAnd now we have something new: a comedy (though a bleak one). Fresh as that might sound to aficionados of Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's work, what's even more innovative is how he has transformed his earlier technique of layering multiple narratives and shifting chronologies into a seemingly linear story that looks like a single unbroken camera take (that is, without edits). From the time we first meet our hero, Riggan Thompson - played by Michael Keaton (in top form and much better served here than by \"RoboCop\") - the camera, though extremely restless, never cuts. Or so it seems. Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki (an Oscar-winner for \"Gravity\" and heretofore the main cinematographer for another Mexican director, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n) have carefully crafted the film to look that way, though in actuality it was not shot as a single take. And if that were all this movie were - an example of bravura filmmaking and choreography - then it would fascinate, for sure, but remain a meaningless magic trick. Instead, this technique is an integral part of the story, since it brings us into the visceral feverish madness of the lead character by bending time and perspective (Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's usual obsessions)\n\nRiggan Thompson is a washed-up former action star, best known for his work in a series of superhero films (the Birdman of the title, which somewhat resemble the \"Batman\" films that Keaton, himself, once starred in). In an effort to rehabilitate his reputation, he has written (and is now directing and starring in), a Broadway play based on the writer Raymond Carver's short story anthology \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\" Rehearsals are not going well. After a stage light falls on his male co-star, he is forced to bring on board an obnoxious New York thespian, Mike Shiner (a very funny Edward Norton, seen earlier this year in \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\"), whose volatility proves a dangerous addition to the production. Along for the ride is a cast of very fine actors, all at the top of their game: Emma Stone (\"Magic in the Moonlight\") as Riggan's daughter; Zach Galifianakis (\"The Hangover\") as his nervous lawyer and friend; Naomi Watts (\"St. Vincent\") as his female co-star; Andrea Riseborough (\"Oblivion\") as his girlfriend (and other co-star); Amy Ryan (\"Win Win\") as his ex-wife; and Lindsay Duncan (\"Le Weekend\") as a nasty theater critic. All serve as both obstacles and opportunities in the way of Riggan's success, and companions on his slide towards insanity.\n\nThe film is a wonderful meditation on the nature of art, its intersection with commerce, and how the search for validation - for admiration - through the creative process is no substitute for real human connections. As Riggan's mind slowly disintegrates and the boundary between his alter ego and real self becomes indistinct, we see how the desperate need for love can destroy us if we can only take and not give. As the movie's opening title card - a Carver poem, \"Late Fragment,\" from  \"A New Path to the Waterfall\" - proclaims:\n\t\"And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so?\n\tI did.\n\tAnd what did you want?\n\tTo call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth.\"\nDid I mention that the film is also extremely funny? Never has madness been this entertaining.",

There is an element of fantasy to this too. Michael Keaton as Riggan has a constant interior monologue in the guise of his alter ego Birdman. These Shakespearean soliloquies add to the experimental feel of the spectacle. The drama opens with him meditating, seated in the lotus position, floating in midair. Later he's moving objects with his mind. The drum heavy score by jazz artist Antonio Sanchez, accentuates many scenes with a thudding percussion beat. The stylish flourishes are to subvert reality. It adds to the manic tension that continues all the way to the ending. It's one of those head scratchers that leaves the audience with a big question instead of closure.

Masterful camerawork mixed with great editing give this film the appearance of rarely being cut; as if it were shot in one long take. Michael Keaton is impressive in a role that echoes his own career, previously starring as the first big screen Caped Crusader, while Edward Norton shows off his usual A-game talent. \n\nI think Uncle Oscar will be very kind to Birdman. \n\nGrade:  A",

Although Batman comparisons are inevitable, and adds to the moviegiers' enjoyment of the role,  it doesn't detract from Keaton's performance.

Kudos to the editor. They must have had one nightmarish job making it flow together so well.\n\nOur lead is Michael Keaton and getting him to play an actor famous for playing a superhero is just genius casting. Oh, and he also gives a great performance as well, battling with the other actors, himself, and his superhero alter-ego. It's a darn good performance.\n\n\nThe rest of the cast performs admirably as well. Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and Andrea Riesborough are all given moments to shine, and all three nail them. However, Edward Norton stands head and shoulders above the rest as an actor who demands hyper-realistic sets and props. He gives the film's best performance. Yes, even better than Keaton.\n\nMost of the flaws with the film are somewhat nitpicky. The drumming used as the score can get a bit irksome, and the vague ending could rub some people the wrong way.

            "content": "\"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" is a movie that will stay with you long after you've left the theater. (Or turned off your bluray player.) It'll linger in your head - like a hovering bird, man. It's the closest you'll come to watching a stage play on a movie screen. (More on that later.)\nIn the film, Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thomson, a once iconic movie star who portrayed the world's biggest superhero, Birdman (in three films), on the big screen. Now he's a washed up actor who is desperately trying to reclaim his elite status in the acting world by staging a play based on the Raymond Carver short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\" But don't you dare try to make a connection between Keaton and Thomson because, according to Keaton, he is nothing like Thomson (despite the two having donned a cape and cowl at the heyday of their careers). In a recent Entertainment Weekly interview, Keaton said: \"In terms of the parallels, I've never related less to a character than Riggan.\" Regardless. Audiences are going to find it hard to separate Keaton and Thomson. Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. Let's say the role of Thomson went to someone who has never starred in a superhero movie (I know, there seem to be so few actors left who haven't starred in a superhero movie, and the film reminds us of that fact) - it wouldn't be as believable, would it? Keaton's past adds great depths to the role, and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu knew that from the beginning. (His disdain for superhero movies is also pretty evident throughout the film.) \nWhen we first meet Thomson, he's seen sitting cross-legged (in his underwear), levitating above the ground. Is this for real, or is this just an illusion? It's hard to know. He also appears to have the ability to control objects with his mind (a la Magento). It's the night before the first preview of his debut in the theater, and tensions are rising high for everyone involved. His daughter, played by Emma Stone (who was in the reboot of Spider-Man, remember), is his assistant, but she's not really keen on trying to calm him down (and she's just been released from rehab). He sees one of his co-stars as an absolute train-wreck, and the only way to get rid of him is to (seemingly) use his telekinetic powers to knock him out with a stage light. But this leaves a gaping hole in the cast. Enter Mike Shiner, played by Edward Norton (who was in \"The Incredible Hulk,\" remember). Mike Shiner is one of the great names in theater - his acting method is \"pure\" and \"real\" (unlike his real-life self). He already knows all of the lines because he's been sleeping with one of the female leads, played by Naomi Watts (who was in \"Tank Girl,\" remember). He seems to be the perfect fit. Until he decides to drink real alcohol while on the stage, belittle Thomson in a high-profile newspaper interview, and suggest that Thomson use a real gun in the final scene instead of a cap-gun. \nDiscover the rest of the plot for yourselves. \n\"Birdman\" delves deep into the mind - and psyche - of Riggan Thomson. His real struggle isn't the stage, or his attempt at a comeback, or his damaged relationships (with his daughter, his ex-wife, his girlfriend), or his past. His real struggle is within himself. He will never be able to succeed because he won't let himself. But is this inner-struggle about Thomson's \"art life\" or is it a struggle with his \"true life\"? Or is it both? Throughout the film he is taunted by his alter-ego (which happens to take the form - and voice - of The Birdman). What's curious is that most of the time The Birdman is mocking Thomson and those around him, but sometimes The Birdman cheers him on. It's almost as if The Birdman represents both Thomson's id and ego (or super-ego, anyway).  \nThis is a film that would have attracted directors like Billy Wilder, I suspect. And, no doubt, Alfred Hitchcock. The humor, the inner-turmoil, the fantastical - all things Wilder and long-time collaborator I. A. L. Diamond would have salivated at the chance to write about. Certainly, Hitchcock's \"Rope\" served as inspiration for the (seemingly) seamless one-long-take the film utilizes. Let's talk about this for a moment. Think about what this can do for viewers. If you're watching a movie directed by, let's say, Michael Bay, you're likely to find numerous quick cuts and edits throughout the movie (more when it's an action scene). Does this heighten the action/suspense, or does it become more of a nuisance for the audience? You decide. But think about this. If you're watching a film, like \"Birdman,\" that is almost entirely comprised of one single take, would you be more aware of the fact that you're watching a movie, or would you almost forget your watching a movie and, instead, become immersed in the movie (as if you're watching a live play on the stage)? For me, it's the latter. The camera zooms down hallways, and bursts out of windows. And I suspect cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki will score an Oscar nomination for his work. (I also suspect Keaton, Norton and Stone will be recognized with nominations.)\nA final thought to consider: Is it possible that the entire film plays out in the mind of Riggan Thomson? Perhaps the playhouse represents his mind. Most of the action takes place within the playhouse (or the bar down the block). It's almost as if Thomson has locked these actors, stagehands, and family members inside the playhouse so he can try to \"direct\" them as he sees fit.",

            "content": "October 17, 2014 (Limited)\n\nThere is a scene late in \"Batman Returns,\" which was Michael Keaton's last superhero film, when Batman glides over Gotham City. Director Tim Burton employed a God's eye view as the Caped Crusader rises from the bottom of the frame and crosses over the top in perfect form. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu presents a similar shot in \"Birdman Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" when Keaton, playing a has-been Hollywood actor whose claim to fame was a superhero not unlike Batman, imagines himself flying over New York City. \n\nIt's safe to assume the similarity between Burton's shot and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's is no coincidence. Keaton was cast in the lead role of \"Birdman\" for a reason, not least because his post-\"Batman\" career may partly mirror that of the character he plays. \n\nBut the idea that the two have anything in common fortunately only adds to the appeal of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's film; it doesn't determine it. \"Birdman\" would be just as sad, humorous and lively without the audience knowing Keaton once played a superhero himself. His character and performance, and the film as a whole, are engaging regardless.\n\nKeaton plays Riggan Thompson, who identifies himself as an actor but whom critics label a celebrity. Riggan once played the title character in a superhero franchise called \"Birdman,\" which was a huge hit, but now, years later, he finds himself struggling to do something (and be someone) that matters. He explains this is why he turned down \"Birdman 4.\" \n\nTo reinvigorate his career, Riggan is funding, directing and starring in a stage adaptation of Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" on Broadway. \"Birdman\" functions not only as a character study of Riggan, who's desperate to reassemble the shattered pieces of his current life, but as an ensemble and often zany comedy about a play that seems destined to fail.\n\nNeither one of these premises is particularly groundbreaking. There have already been movies about once-famous Hollywood actors who now feel they've drifted into obscurity (\"Sunset Boulevard\",  \"Somewhere\"), and about the behind-the-scenes shenanigans of a tumultuous stage production (\"Topsy-Turvy,\" \"Shakespeare in Love\"). These recycled setups are perhaps what hold \"Birdman\" back from total greatness, but together they still make for an engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable experience. \n\nMuch of this is owed to I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's technique of making it seem like the entire film was shot in one take, which raises the energy and tension levels and we get the sense something or someone is always about to burst. Whether or not something actually does, I'll let you discover, but this approach keeps us on edge and we instantly get caught up in the characters and their absurd situations. \nAnd speaking of the characters, they are inhabited by a team of enthusiastic actors who seemed to know they were making something special. They include Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's producer and best friend who will tell the star just about anything to ensure the show goes on and they recoup at least some of their investment; Edward Norton as a talented but egotistical thespian who thinks he can come along and steal the spotlight, not to mention Riggan's daughter/assistant, who's just completed a stint in rehab. She's played by Emma Stone and it's clear the source of her emotional problems goes beyond drugs. There's also Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts as the two actresses in Riggan's play, whose collective frustration and lack of faith in Riggan, or men in general, leads them to explore alternative options.\n\nThe camera playfully follows each of these pieces of work into every nook and cranny of the theater as the cast and crew prepare for the play's upcoming previews. All the while, we wonder whether an uptight theater critic's (Lindsey Duncan) preemptive scathing review will cause the show to sink or swim. Or perhaps fly is the better word, since Riggan seems to possess the same powers as Birdman, who, oddly enough, speaks in the same low, bass tone as Batman and constantly eggs Riggan on. The movie wisely never substantiates Riggan's potential schizophrenia or his superhuman abilities like levitations and telekinesis.\n\nOverall, \"Birdman\" may not surprise us with its narrative trajectory, but that hardly makes it any less of a pleasure. On the surface, it's rhythmic and infectiously funny, and on a deeper level, we really come to care about Riggan, and not just because he's pathetic, but also because we see he genuinely wants to do right for his daughter, the other players, and himself. We're naturally inclined to root for him and although this may be a familiar story of redemption, it's still a moving one. \n\nIt does help that Keaton once played Batman, but I think he'd be just as effective in this role even if he hadn't. He shares a scene late in the film with Amy Ryan, who plays Riggan's ex-wife, that's so strong and nuanced, it reminds us of Keaton's range as an actor. If he receives an Oscar nomination, this scene will be why he wins. \n\nI'm honestly surprised it took Hollywood this long to make a modern film that centers on a washed-up actor known for playing a superhero. \"Birdman\" is well aware of the current times and the prolificacy of the superhero genre, going so far as to make snide comments about Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. It knows that actors who play such larger-than-life figures are often doomed to be typecast and thought of as nothing else. \"Birdman\" runs with this notion and makes it both fun and dramatic, reminding us that humans are indeed mutable creatures, capable of reinventing and redefining ourselves. This is not a novel message, and it's one Hollywood delivers more often than not, but it still helps to hear it.",

Why did this happen? \n\nHow bizarre, how strange, how weird, how curious, how unbelievably intriguing? After Keaton leaves his dressing room, the camera follows him, and doesn't stop. It moves to other people, follows their lives, their thoughts, then comes back. I cannot get over how innovative and intriguing this film is. Along with this brilliant camerawork, the film has a fantastic script; sharp, funny, and even satirical. I smiled the whole time while watching this film. \n\n\"Birdman\" is the story of a man who used to play an iconic superhero in the movies, who's now haunted by these memories in his own mind, who tries to make it on Broadway. The movie is a trip through the lives of our main character, Riggan (the guy who played Birdman) and the others surrounding him. It reminded me of a Tarantino movie in a way, because of the level of ambition in the script, and the long, but masterful, meaningful scenes.\n\n\"Birdman\" is the best film of the year.

It's more cheerful than anything I've seen from I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. It's art-positive. The performances are terrific. I've never thought of Keaton as a serious actor but his performance here changed my mind entirely about that. Norton is better than I've seen him a long time. The problem is that there is absolutely nothing new here. The relationships studied by the film, the characters examined, the questions of artistic integrity and selling out, have all been been done and done and done.",

Riggan's daughter has lived without the feeling of being beloved and has given up on it's pursuit.  One character seeks motherhood for the feeling of love.  Another a career on broadway.  throughout the film is Riggan's internal voice asserting Riggan's greatness; he is worthy of being loved.  A superhero battling the main characters own self-doubt and contrary evidence.

That hasn't stopped Murray from being great in a number of dramatic films, Lost in Translation and Groundhog Day being at the top of the list. St. Vincent isn't going to end up on Bill Murray's greatest hits, but the \"comedian\" elevates a standard screenplay with sound acting chops. Plus he does a little dance number.\n\nMaggie (Melissa McCarthy) and her son Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher) are forced to uproot and move to Brooklyn. Unfortunately, they move next door to curmudgeonly Vincent (Bill Murray), who is having his share of life problems as well. Because of her long work hours, Maggie reluctantly pays Vincent to watch Oliver after school. The two form an unlikely friendship, will Murray's life skills teaching Oliver how to grow up and fend for himself.\n\nTheodore Melfi wrote this script and directed the movie himself. The story means well, but doesn't really establish itself as anything other than an \"old coot and innocent kid bond\" story. Crotchetiness and naivete are established early. Does the kid need help standing up for himself and does the old man have some tips? Does the old man's past with a foreign woman (Naomi Watts) cause a severe plot shift? Is an oft mentioned absentee character going to show up in the third act? Does the old man have a secret soft side? Is there a big reconciliation after a split of the friendship? If you've EVER seen a movie, you'll know what the answers to these questions are.\n\nDespite the overt manipulation, Bill Murray is here to pick up the slack. Murray's jovial side is in evidence even during the early scenes, when horrible choices are consistently thrust upon him. The scenes with him and your Jaeden are cute and fun. Murray's presence elevates Melissa McCarthy's performance, especially when she's backed into a corner by Vincent. Murray's chops are tested in the third act, where a contrived event forces him really sell a believable state for his character. When the climactic event happens, I was only rooting for the obvious because of how well Bill Murray sold the old man to me.\n\nIt makes me a little sad to think Peter Venkman himself is now forced to take old man roles. However, Bill Murray's years of development give me hope that some long overdue awards could be in his future. St. Vincent could be the start of that; Academy Voters, look past the fact that this movie is cloying and give Murray a nod. You owe him for Lost in Translation.",

BIRDMAN is a satire on Keaton's career as he plays a washed-up actor whose biggest role was playing the superhero Birdman 20 years earlier. He stages a comeback by putting on a play on Broadway. Sound familiar to one of Keaton's roles as a certain Dark Knight? Keaton is at his manic best as an actor who is stressed out about the show while hearing his Birdman alter ego act as his conscience. The supporting cast is top notch, with Edward Norton playing a over-the-top version of himself and Emma Stone as Keaton's recovering addict daughter. Both actors, along with Keaton should deserve some love come awards season. Director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu shoots the movie with handheld cameras and what seems to be one, long continuous shot, which is done seamlessly and something that makes this film unique. This takes filmmaking to a whole new level. Because of this type of storytelling, more praise should be given to the cast a crew for pulling such a difficult task. BIRDMAN is quirky, funny, out of control, and bizarre. You really never know what is reality and what is fantasy in this film, and even the end will be up to interpretation. Either way, this isn't Michael Keaton's comeback. This is his statement.\n\nGrade: A",

Sure BIRDMAN is a talky film, but it's the most cinematic expression of live theater I've ever seen.  Many have attempted to adapt a play to film with diminishing results, often falling prey to too much talk, too static presentation, or worse, falsely \"opening up\" the piece by simply setting some scenes outside. Director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (BABEL, 21 GRAMS, AMORES PERROS) along with his co-screenwriters, Nicolas Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo have created an all-out war between Hollywood and Broadway with BIRDMAN.  \n\nStarring Michael Keaton in the role of a lifetime, his Riggan Thomson is a character seemingly modeled after his own experiences - a once-A-list Superhero star who turns down a sequel and years later mounts a Broadway show to reignite his stalled career.  Bristling with a tortured ego, nervous energy, desperation, and a wellspring of hidden talents, Riggan stalks the theatre in a constant search for sparring partners.  \n\nPresented as almost one seemingly continuous shot, this backstage dramedy gives its audience the thrill of live performance while constantly keeping things visually exciting.  Can we just name Emmanuel Lubezki  (GRAVITY, CHILDREN OF MEN ) the greatest living cinematographer and call it a day?  This isn't the first film to attempt this, with Alfred Hitchcock's ROPE and Alexander Sokurov's RUSSIAN ARK being two notable examples, but the way this film plays with time transitions and reveals is breathtaking.  Furthermore, this shooting style allows this stellar cast to truly live with their characters, and the payoff is explosive.  \n\nEmma Stone has never been better as Riggan's fresh out of rehab daughter/personal assistant.  She may be wounded, but she's nobody's fool.  Her self-possession here is a joy to watch, and in one bruising scene, she lets out a spectacular fury that should be a required audition monologue for aspiring actors.  Zach Galifianakis plays against type as Riggan's stressed out manager/lawyer and shows great, straightforward vulnerability.  Naomi Watts is edgy and hilarious as Riggan's co-star, especially in a great scene she shares with Andrea Riseborough, who after a string of dramatic roles shows she excels at comedy.  Amy Ryan is pitch perfect as Riggan's ex and Lindsay Duncan has a great, bile-filled speech as the all-powerful theatre critic who's gunning for our star.  But let's face it, Keaton's triumph here aside, everyone will be talking about Edward Norton's incredible turn as Mike Shiner, perhaps the world's most difficult actor.   A last minute replacement in the stage show, Shiner challenges everybody and everything when he isn't trying to fuck them.  He comes across as exactly what you would expect it to be like to work with Norton, and the results are so specific, so gloriously detailed, and so damn entertaining, you just can't wait to see what he'll do next.  \n\nBIRDMAN takes you on an actor's journey to stay relevant, to literally and figuratively face his demons, to experience real performance vs. the soul-sucking idiocy that can be blockbuster films.  Keaton dares to be an indulgent, raging narcissist here, yet miraculously manages to make Riggan a thrillingly entertaining figure throughout.  \n\nIf I have to quibble a little, it's with the monotonous, percussive score by Martin Hernandez.  The incessant jazz drumming got old really fast yet kept up its paces throughout the entire running time.  Every so often an orchestral score would take over, and its melodies would be sweet relief from the unbearable pretensions of the rest.  There were times when the camera would glide by an actual drummer, which quite possibly made my eyes roll into the back of my head.  Tune out the drums and you've got an original, funny, heartbreaking film.  It's a minor misfire in a dazzling piece of cinema.  Audiences who grow tired of talk get their big special effects moments here and there, making BIRDMAN the thinking person's superhero play.  I'd say that's worth a refreshing standing ovation.",

With very clever and quick writing, you honestly feel like you are floating along with these actors as they crack jokes, get pissed off at each other, or are just having a natural conversation. There is truly something remarkable about this filmmaking choice, and after the films final events, the film feels like even more of a punch to the gut for Hollywood. Brutal, hilarious, and almost beautiful at times, \"Birdman\" is one of the best films of 2014!",

If there was an Olympic competition for cinematography, Emmanuel Lubezki would reign supreme as his work on the stedicam is fluid and balletic just like his previous work with Alfonso Cuaron. With an incredible cast and a visionary filmmaker at the helm, Birdman stands out as a raw, original, and powerful work of art.",

For me, it was about how, in life, we do everything we can to make ourselves believe we are controlling our surroundings and what's happening to us. When really all we are doing is affecting the outcome, but not controlling it. Everything that happens to us is not up to us, but we can reclaim what we can of ourselves and go forward with a new attitude.\n\nThis is what Michael Keaton's character does in the film. We see things happening as he sees them. And as the film's subtitle suggests, the virtue of his ignorance is his only way to relate to his surroundings, and the world, and his inner voice is the only thing keeping him from going over the edge, until he does.\n\nOn other notes, Edward Norton is absolutely hilarious as the over the top method theater actor. Apart from opening and closing segments of the film, it's made to look like it's all one shot, which obviously it's not but for movie people it's fun to try and see where they actually cut.\n\nI feel like more and more we live in a world where things aren't interesting unless they're meta.

I myself felt this tied into a more universal theme though, one of a man trying to control his legacy and his impact on the world around him, make his time on earth mean something if only just to him. There's a blurring of the line between fantasy and reality on a couple levels, perhaps meant as a commentary on how the former can impact the latter. In the role of an obsessive, self important actor, Ed Norton personifies a certain kind of personality to comedic extremes, someone focused on his work to where hostility and aggression become totally impersonal tools of the trade. Emma Stone's cynical blogger rang as a touch two dimensional, but at the same time there was a humanity to how her upbringing pushed her in this direction. Other thematic focuses seemed to be on a sort of a pull between devotion to one's art, and the personal havoc in wreaked on ones life, and the conflict between Keaton and Norton does seem to bring up whether a work is a product of the director or a collaborative effort. \n\nStylistically there was a kind of 70s movie inspired tone mixed with modern surrealism. I'm not exactly sure on what cutting the film to look like a single continuous shot was meant to achieve, perhaps to create a sense of the elements of the characters' lives and fantasies blending together. At any rate, it meshed well with the style of the movie. In some ways, it felt like some of the cynicism running through the film was an excuse for covering up insecurities about the screenplay, that cliches could be evoked \"ironically\" to avoid accountability.",

Michael Keaton - who needs to win an Oscar for this role - plays a washed up actor who was the star of a Batman-esque franchise called Birdman (which, in the film, ended with Birdman 3 in 1992, and was never remade or revisited by Hollywood). To resurrect his career, he mounts a play based on the work of Raymond Carver. Every shot, every action, and every prop was intentional, the acting is raw, and the film has a lot to say about celebrity, acting, theater, Hollywood, superhero franchises, and self-worth. It's a gorgeous film, shot entirely as one long continuous shot, with an ending open to interpretation. Emma Stone - who typically plays comedy - is the one performer who stands out for being very serious, including one scene where she also earned her Oscar nod for her incredible work. And Edward Norton, a notoriously difficult actor to work with, plays an actor...who is difficult to work with. But his motivations are so beautifully fleshed out, he too needed a nod.

This film winning best picture makes me happy, because it's different. It's not a conventional Oscar movie, as in not about someone in history or events that happened in the past. It was an original movie that won, and that doesn't happen that often. \n As for the actual movie, it's fantastic. Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu crushed it. For the story of the movie, it's about an aging actor named Riggan, played by Michael Keaton, who did superhero movies. He did sequels of the superhero Birdman, and he was then not respected as an actor so he decides to make a play, he writes, directs, and stars in his own play. Riggan is doing this to show everyone who he is and what he can do, that he deserves their resepect. There are many different characters that are, weird, for the most part. There is the producer of the play named Jake, played by Zach Galifianakis. Mike, played by Edward Norton, an actor that is loved by critics joins the play.  I mean, this is a fantastic cast, Emma Stone plays Riggan's daughter, and Naomi Watts plays another actress in the play, which is in a relationship with Mike.  All the performances are great, but there are two stand outs in which I want to mention. First is Michael Keaton, this is his greatest performance of his career. He really becomes the character, Michael Keaton is a recognizable person but I didn't see him, I saw his character. Another performance which I would like to point out is Zach Galifianakis, it was surprising that he could pull this off. I've only seen him in comedic roles where he just does the same thing over and over, but this performance was different it was real. He plays more of a serious role, and he's great in it, he holds his own with all these other great actors. In my opinion, Zach Galifianakis, in this film, was the most surprising performance of 2014. I believe Zach's performance was great because he was under a great director. Alejandro G. Inarritu was fantastic behind the camera. If he can make Zach Galifianakis give a good performance, I wonder what he can't do. \nSpeaking of being behind the camera, the cinematography is amazing. You probably already know by now, but the whole thing looks like one tracking shot. It's virtually impossible to detect the cuts, I couldn't detect them. A very well deserved award for the cinematography, I applaud Emmanuel Lubezki. And while we are on the subject of technical achievements, the score...is alright. Look, I didn't love it like other people do, but I like it, I like how it fits with the story. The score, in my opinion, is the weakest part of the film. I'm not saying the score was bad, not even close; it's just as creative and imaginative as the film itself.  But if that's my only complaint, that I didn't like the score that much, then it shows you how amazing this movie is.",

            "content": "Here we are in 2014.  For whatever reason, being meta is incredibly popular in mainstream film right now.  Plenty of movies are acting self-aware these days and it is actually coming up on the point of feeling cheap rather than interesting or at the very least a fun novelty.  Some movies have handled this trend well, such as \"22 Jump Street\" and \"They Came Together,\" and some have merely exploited it for no real benefit, like \"This is the End.\"  Here we have \"Bridman,\" a film that comes as close to being meta as humanly possible without ever actually saying it out loud.  Michael Keaton plays former Hollywood superstar, Riggan Thomson, who made billions in the early 90's as the popular superhero Birdman and now, many years later, is trying to reinvent himself as a serious actor, and no one seems to care (an obvious metaphor for Keaton's own \"Batman\" career).  Even beyond that, the movie is still very \"inside Hollywood,\" and by the end of the film everything that was charming about being meta has worn out its welcome.\n \n\"Birdman\" boasts such a strong first half that you may leave the theater wondering what happened to it during the second.  Nothing happened to it, and that's the film's biggest problem: the first half is virtually identical to the second half.  The film falls into a repetition as we watch these characters struggle to open a play adapted by Thomson from Raymond Carver, but the first half really is a marvelous piece of cinema.  Keaton gives off a phenomenal performance that can be appreciated by all and good for him because he deserves to have another performance to be remembered by under his belt.  He is the heart and soul of this film and in classic Keaton form, is able to bring the audience from laughter to anger in just a few seconds.\n \nThe other two most notable performances come from Edward Norton and Emma Stone.  Norton (who possibly needed a good role even more than Keaton) does his absolute best to bring the character of Mike to life.  There are scenes here where we are instantly reminded of why Norton was once one of the top actors in the business before burning too many bridges, and oddly enough, his best work is done in the scenes where he gets to relax and just be a real person but at times tries a little too hard during the scenes where he gets to be the eccentric stage actor he's playing.  It might be a bit of his own fault but I do put some of the blame on the uneven writing of his character.  Even so, I was thrilled to see Norton doing some solid acting in a good movie again.  And Emma Stone brings as much complexity as she can to the character, Sam, Riggan's fresh-out-of-rehab daughter.\n \nDespite the serious nature of the film, all of the actors appear to be having a good time with it and really hit the audience hard with the comedic moments.  In order to give off the vibe like we're watching a play on screen, the film is shot as if it is all done in one continuous take which really makes you appreciate the performances and how difficult it is to time the scenes but during some back and forth dialogue scenes you may find yourself wishing that the camera would just cut back and forth between the two actors speaking to each other rather than moving back and forth or just cutting some speaking characters out of the shot altogether.\n \nWhile the film is only two hours, it feels much longer near the end because of the repetition.  I began to ask myself, \"how many more rehearsals and previews do we need to watch?  When is it going to be opening night?\"  We see Riggan's tension and neuroses build higher and higher with every rehearsal and we go deep into his mind as we see him imagining he actually has superpowers, and we also get to hear his inner monologue narrated not quite by himself but his alter-ego Birdman, a constant reminder of mistakes and failures of his life and career.\n \nOf course \"Birdman\" is pretentious and a bit repetitive but it is also strangely lots of fun.  Everyone does the best job they can and perhaps with a different director, would have been the perfect piece of abstract yet mainstream film that everyone so desperately wants this to be.  If anything, \"Birdman\" starts a conversation and for that I can do nothing but recommend it.",

The spectacle comes in the form of the camera work and a grounded use of special effects. The scenes have a crisp visual fidelity reminiscent of car commercials.\n\nSometimes it was honestly hard to follow along, but it was never not rewarding throughout.

Inarritu is a world class filmmaker with \"Amores Perros\", \"21 Grams,\" \"Babel,\" \"Biutiful,\" and now \"Birdman,\" which is his most ambitious film to date.  His skill with actors, camerawork and the technical aspects of production always makes his films worth seeing.  But often he uses gimmicks like the nonlinear style of \"21 Grams,\" crosscutting across the world in \"Babel\" or the shock effects of the dogfight and car crash in \"Amores Perros.\"  The problem with \"Birdman\" is that he introduces so many things that are very visual, but just don't pay off in the story - the lesbian seduction, the moving objects, the levitation, the superhero narrator conscience, just to name a few in the first 20 minutes alone, that never satisfactorily develop and conclude in the film.\n\nThe film tries to be many things, but never really accomplishes any of them.  It's about celebrity and fame, madness in the theater, a self centered actor who screws up the lives around him, a satire of empty entertainment vs. real meaning in art.  Like the visual gimmicks, it introduces all these themes, then never follows through, so you are left with cool visual imagery, but no satisfactory insight or resolution about any of the ideas.\n\nMichael Keaton has the role of a lifetime here and will certain get nominations and even awards.  The other cast support him very well, especially Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Emma Stone.  The film is reminiscent of \"The Fisher King,\" but unlike that memorable Robin Williams-Jeff Bridges masterpiece, also about madness and celebrity in New York, \"Birdman\" lacks the central script working on all the levels the film aspires to be on.",

            "content": "Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's (\"Babel\" and \"Amores Perros\") films, although frequently critically acclaimed, often get pegged as being downbeat and gloomy. So, it's a genuine surprise to many that his latest, the wondrous \"Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),\" is such a witty, often hilarious and even moving film.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about Michael Keaton's comeback in the movie as Riggan Thompson, a washed up Hollywood star known mostly for his role as the film's titular superhero who is staging a resurgence by putting on a theatrical production of Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" on Broadway. And, for sure, the role is Keaton's juiciest in some time. As Riggan, he is able to dig into a character who is equally flawed, poignant, goofy and, at times, borderline delirious. And Inarritu complements his character's moments of frustration and anguish with magical realist flights of fancy that would have made Gabriel Garcia Marquez proud.\n\nBut although Keaton is great in the movie, there's enough praise to go around for the entire cast, which includes a very solid Naomi Watts as a Broadway first timer, Emma Stone in her best performance to date as Riggan's ex-drug addict daughter who also works as her father's assistant, a very restrained Zach Galifianakis as Riggan's manager and friend and Amy Ryan as the former star's ex-wife.\n\nEdward Norton nearly steals the show as Mike Shiner, the prima donna Broadway star whom Riggan calls in at the last moment to act in the play after a colleague is seriously injured by a falling stage light. Norton's always been a fine actor, but who knew how funny he could be? Shiner is a handful, trashing the stage's props during a preview show and then later taking a sex scene a little too far with a fellow actor.\n\nOne of the elements of the film that has drawn much attention is the way that Inarritu makes it appear as if the entire movie were one continuous shot. Obviously, it's not and the filmmaker employs some techniques similar to those of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rope.\" But the picture always feels as if it is in motion, following one character down a hallway, only to take up with another heading a different direction. Rather than feeling gimmicky, the technique creates the tension involved in a Broadway production's final hours before it is unveiled to the public.\n\nAnother aspect of \"Birdman\" that makes it unique is how it plays upon its actors' real lives to comment on their characters in the film. Keaton, as we all know, shot to fame playing a superhero and Inarritu's film is a comeback for him, much as the Carver play is for Riggan. And Norton has been known - on occasion - to be a high strung collaborator, although I'd be willing to bet his obnoxious Shiner is exaggerated for the sake of hilarity.\n\n\"Birdman\" is, of course, also about the artistic process and the film's final frames struck a similar note to the finale of Darren Aronofsky's \"Black Swan,\" although Inarritu's picture ends on a more hopeful - rather than bleak - note. This has been a year for great final shots - \"Boyhood,\" \"Under the Skin\" and \"The Immigrant\" come to mind - and \"Birdman\" has a pretty terrific one as well.\n\nThis is a thematically rich and extremely entertaining film with some pointed commentary on the process of making art as well as the modern methods of making it accessible to the public. Everything from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook to smart phones and comic book movies come under fire. This is one of the year's best.",

            "content": "I honestly didn't know what to expect with a cast like this, and the rumor of a non-stop camera take. First of all, the cast made this film come to life. From the quick little comedic bits of Zach Galifianakis's hilarious supporting role to the believable daughter role created ever-so-brilliantly by Emma Stone, this film delivers the perfect amount of comedy, drama, action, and even tragedy. But the true highlights of this film are from the two leading men, Michael Keaton and Edward Norton. Norton creates a character that the audience just loves to hate, and then loves to love at the end. A supporting actor nomination and even win are VERY likely for him. As for Keaton, I have never seen an actor as dedicated or believable as he in this film. He truly comes to life in this film and in my mind, deserves the Oscar right now...why wait till Spring?! There are plenty of films about \"washed up actors\" or \"wannabe stars,\" but Keaton takes it to the next level, bringing tears, laughs, and emotion to the audience in the most believable way. Believability, in my mind, is vital, and Keaton nails it to the bone. Aside from the acting, the cinematography that Birdman offers, as well as the (less than) five minutes of special effects, are truly breathtaking. For those of you who don't know, the entire film is done in ONE take, even transitioning from night to day, without cutting the camera ONCE. Seeing the camera seamlessly transition between scenes makes the whole thing seem real and like you're literally walking through the hallways and backstage of the St. James theatre. Everything about the writing, cinematography, and acting, make Birdman a must see, and create a LEGEND out of Michael Keaton. Watch out for this film come Oscar time, for you'll see it on the list in MANY places.",

Birdman tells the tale of a man who once played a famed superhero back in his early days of acting. Now he must battle his alter ego(Birdman) in order to premiere his play on broadway so he can back into the world. One of the biggest complements I can give to this movie is the directing by iruitu, his choice of making it look all like one shot is genius. The acting was also spot on everyone gave great performances, but the p that stands out most is Keaton, he will and should win the best actor Oscar I'm not just saying that because of everyone else but because of how much effort he put in to this role. Norton also gave a great performance as Keatons co-star in his play, Emma stone also great I mean really what isn't there to love about Emma stone.....whoa got off track there for a minute. The music as well is great not as good as interstellar though but its still good though, also the cineamatography in this movie holy cow this movie looked beautiful from start to finish. Now your all probably saying to yourselves hey man you just love it because everyone else loved it, go watch Boyhood its a far superior film then this and to that I say no, I like this movie because it was original anyone could direct a movie for twelve years and get an Oscar nod, but for someone who made a beautiful movie like this and shot it the way he did deserves best picture and director. One final thing there's a scene in this movie where Keaton is in a bar and he's talking to a critic and the critic says she's going to give it a bad review even though she had yet to see the play, now I'm guilty of this I have criticised a film before I saw it but that's beside the point Keaton exerted so much heart and passion and energy into that scene and I thought to myself, yeah give this man the Oscar. My final grade for this movie is an A+, go check it out now if its playing in a theater near you its worth your time!!!!",

Shooting the film in the appearance of a single long-take (with the most subtle of cuts), Birdman's cinematic flourish actually accentuates it's themes regarding artistry, as it makes the film carry the look of a play, only wistfully projected through the world of cinema. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu also comments on virtually every spectrum of the entertainment world here (criticism, budgetary-concerns, low-brow vs. high-brow), yet the movie never feels messy, and wraps it all together in a truly sublime and uplifting fashion. Carried by a wide-range of familiar actors (many of whom are gloriously breaking their type-cast here), the film remains highly accessible and entertaining even when most cerebral, and in many ways it resembles the perfect comic-book film that Hollywood has tried so long to film. An ensemble dramedy masterpiece, that can join the likes of Boogie Nights and Pulp Fiction as an instant classic!",

It goes up when an intense scene goes on and it goes down when everything seems fine and then it goes up again when it's intense and so on.\n\nBirdman feels like it's a semi-autobiography movie for Michael Keaton. I did not see his other movies including his run as Batman but his performance in this movie alone is enough for me to agree that he is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. I do hope this movie gives him more roles to do in the future now he received tons of critical acclaim on his performance.\n\nI like how Michael Keaton did not overshadow the other cast in the movie because the cast performance is brilliant. It seemed like they're real people in this movie. My favorite performers in this movie besides Michael Keaton were Edward Norton and Emma Stone. They both had their great moments in this movie.\n\nThe movie's plot relies on character development and they did a good job doing that. The movie's plot also relies on social commentary about Hollywood which they were on point about it especially about \"washed up\" actors trying to be relevant again as well as the \"snobby critics\" which was my favorite scene in the entire movie.\n\nI don't usually comment on musical scores in this movie but I cannot ignore the score in this movie because it was really good. The use of the drums in this movie as a score is perfectly used considering the intense tone of the movie.\n\nThe direction from Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in this movie is amazing. Not to forget that this movie excel the \"shot in one take\" style of filming very well. It feels like they really shot the movie in one take thanks to clever editing skills.\n\nBirdman could be an Oscar winner next year thanks to its brilliant cast performance especially from Michael Keaton, Edward Norton and Emma Stone as well as great character development, on-point social commentary about Hollywood, really good musical score, amazing direction from Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and its well-done \"shot in one take\" filming style.\n\nBirdman is easily not only one of my favorite movies of 2014 but as well as one of my favorite movies of all-time.",

This film has a fantastic cast, I mean really fantastic, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, Naomi Watts and Lindsay Duncan. Every one is amazing, Keaton especially is amazing as Riggan Thomas, it's the best peformance of his career and he definitely deserved his nomination and maybe he even deserved win, I can't wait to see what he does next. Edward Norton is amazing in this movie he's really funny and annoying at the same time, Norton is apparently very hard to work with and this film does a parody of that. Emma Stone is also fantastic, she has a fantastic monologue and gives one of the best peformances of her career. Galifianakis is also fantastic and it's a very different peformance for him. The film is also amazingly directed Alejandro G Inarittu directed this film so well and he 100% deserved his Oscar I can't wait to see his new film the Renevant. This film also has fantastic cinematography, the movie is meant to look like it was shot in one take so you without good cinematography this film would have fallen apart. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen it's amazing. The score for this film is also very amazing it's this drum solo that plays whenever there's an intense scene, it's almost like a character itself. It's so simple and so affective. There's also a great piece of music that plays when Riggan imagines himself flying. The Birdman character is also great, we hear him talking in Riggan's head and then see him also a few times and he is great and also does have a lot to say about making a comeback. This film is also really funny, it's not constant laugh out loud every second funny but there are some really funny bits which come from the amazing writing which is so brilliant. The writing is so good all the lines feel natural and the monologues are great. There is this really brilliant scene, it's probably my favourite part of the film where Riggan just slams into this critic who is going to give his show a bad review because she doesn't like him. It's fantastically written and a brilliant scene. This film is just so brilliant it's really hard to describe. If I had any problems it's that some scenes do go on a bit. Also I would have loved to see more of the actual play as those were some of the best scenes. However Birdman is an amazing film. It deserved it's best picture win and is destined to become a classic. This film does live up to they hype and it's great. It's one of the best movies of 2015. A",

After correctly guessing what it will be, I was not prepared for the visual/cerebral assault that took place in the next 2 hours. For anyone who has ever bemoaned the homogeneity and predictability of modern cinema, Birdman is the answer. A film showcasing a revitalised Michael Keaton (aided also by an amazing supporting cast from Norton to Stone to even Galifianakas, who normally can be quite grating) throwing everything he's got on the screen, losing oneself to a role so selflessly without reservation or vanity that it would be a crime not to give him a nod come Oscars time.  But this is also the director's film. Inarritu has made a slightly surreal film about a Hollywood actor trying to find legitimacy in a self-financed Broadway play, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy to great (narrative and visual) effect, he ingeniously decided to emulates the fluidity and flow of a theatrical play with one seemingly continuous tracking shot that is literally breathtakingly intense and so fluid that it glides non-stop for the duration of the film from beginning to (almost the) end. Lubezki, after his stunning work on Gravity is behind the camera again gunning for a 2nd consecutive Oscar with the help of some seamless editing, intelligent and unobtrusive use of CGI and a pulsating percussive soundtrack that literally drove the film ever onwards. The film is exhausting to watch but you cannot take your eyes off of it until the very last enigmatic scene that leaves you pondering what it all means. Thought-provoking and unique, this is a rare experience that I expect people will talk about for a long time to come.",

            "content": "The more I think about this film as time goes, the more I really appreciate this films message. Starting with the great story of an actor who played a superhero in the late 1980s to the early 1990s after becoming a household name, Birdman. The movie centralizes on the actor named Riggan, who is played by Micheal Keaton on trying to change his image to reflect not how people see him but how he sees himself as well as struggling with his confidence. The movies narrative is straight forward but its delivery is truly stunning mostly due to the cinematography, by making all the scenes look like one shot. That being said what it shows are standout performances from the cast, especially from Keaton. Now there are arguements being made about how this movie is pretty much his life, I would say it is very similar but not entirely accurate. The movie focuses more on the psyche of actors and actresses for the same reason Keaton's character Riggan are working towards. Some of the characters we sympathize with in terms of their mental well being, some of characters we disregard for their actions or for why they act but this is definitely Riggans story of a person who questions his actions to hopefully deal with his demons. He is consistently having a hard time to keep his demons at bay while also dealing with his family (mostly his daughter played by Emma Stone) and the play. The movie really punches the audience in the face regarding how movies are just being cash grab blockbusters and not a lot of creatively is being put into the movies. It really hits audiences and critics on the idea that they demand a lot from actors but are never satisfied. It also depicts the perspective that everyone just labels everything and doesn't think about the creative process it took to make a play or film. The message only strengthens the movie story giving it a greater impact to where we get a greater sense of reliability between Riggan and the viewer. I suppose with Michael leading this story it certainly does help the film have a genuine approach and I can understand the arguments being made. Choosing Michael Keaton as the lead role was a phenomenal choice, as I can't see how it would have worked with any other actor, especially with the realism. Overall this movie has a great message and its story is really spot on. A well deserved praise is due for Micheal Keaton as he was able to show weakness and humility throughout the films narrative as well as captivating an actors integrity making it feel like a unique experience. Come Oscar season I wouldn't mind if it won at all.",

            "content": "Birdman: How did we end up here?\n\nAs if I needed more reasons to want to love Michael Keaton as a performer, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has given the actor a fantastic role that puts him back in the spotlight, in a film that puts heavy emphasis on what it is to mean something to many, only to want to redefine one's self.  That is just one of the many ideas that Birdman tackles, as the film plays as a very entertaining dissection of Hollywood, Broadway, and the notion of fame in our modern culture.  Additionally, Inarritu was far from content with treating this project as a simple satirical exercise, so the film is made to show us the weeks that go by in this story within nearly one long take.  This shot is of course many shots carefully stitched together, but the screenplay is also a careful assemblage of ideas, themes, and great moments for all the actors to shine.  This makes Birdman an ambitious and unpredictable ball of energy that just so happens to be a spectacular film to watch.\n\nread the whole review at thecodeiszeek.com",

            "content": "Like most people I know, my interest in Birdman came from the obvious parallels between Michael Keaton's real career and that of the character he is playing. In Birdman Keaton plays Riggan Thomson. A Hollywood actor who's last great role was in the 1990's when he stared as the title character in Birdman 3. Keaton of course will always be most well known for playing Batman in the first two (serious) Batman films. But that's where the comparisons between Keaton and Riggan Thomson stop. Keaton's real life persona, and Riggan Thomson's couldn't be any further from each other, and the plot of the film is definitely nothing like what you would see in a summer superhero block buster. All of which is good news for the audience.\n\nThe film is mostly about the fate of a play Riggan has adapted, is directing, and starring in-this of course rubs some Broadway diehards the wrong way, such as Edward Norton's character, a beloved Broadway actor named Mike Shiner, and a New York Times critic played by Lindsay Duncan-but it's also about the insatiable attention artists crave, and what lengths they're willing to go to get it; to stay relevant in today's lightning speed culture. The film hits all the right beats, but it delivers them in that strange way that only an independent film can dare to do. Now don't let that last statement turn you off, this isn't a head scratching movie (well, except for maybe the ending), it is grounded in a realism that's sorely missing from the majority of todays films, and is a welcome addition to Keaton's filmography.",

Sometimes you don't know if what you're seeing is the \"real\" part of the story or something in the mind of Michael Keaton's character, Riggan, the actor and director of a new play on Broadway, but it's all engrossing and I couldn't look away. I honestly cared for this character. He's half insane with a voice in his head that sounds like his low self-esteem while he goes tries to weather the storm of producing his play, dealing with a disappointed daughter, a crazy actor, relationships with two women, and a theatre critic who hates him. It's definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time.",

This drama comedy lampoons not only the current state of superhero obsessed Hollywood but also the snobbish Broadway scene. Birdmans strength, being one of the most topical movie you will ever see is also its weakness. The current state of all the things it criticizes well have changed in 5 or 10 years making this film far from timeless.

            "content": "\"How did we end up here? This place is horrible. It smells like balls.\"\nIn case you are wondering, this is not a superhero movie.\nBirdman is a black comedy about Riggan Thomson (Keaton, the best performance in years), a washed-up actor who played a superhero in blockbuster movies, trying to make his comeback by writing, directing, and starring in a theatrical adaptation of Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". He is so desperate to prove that he's an artist and that he can do something other than a superhero character.\nThe play is produced by his best friend/lawyer Jake (Galifianakis, superb), and stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura, first-time-Broadway-actress Lesley (Watts, great), and Mike Shiner (Norton, terrific as always), an actor who is notorious for being difficult to work with. There's only a few days left until the opening, and Riggan is on the verge of nervous breakdown.\nOh, he also tries to rekindle his relationship with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone, her most outstanding performance ever), a recovering drug addict who works as Riggan's assistant, AND he has to deal with Birdman, his alter ego that keeps whispering in his mind. His ego is so big and it's killing himself.\nIt's a huge leap forward for writer-director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the mastermind behind 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006). Who would've thought that he could make a showbiz satire? The idea is so ambitious and full of creativity, the story is compelling, and the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. It's a crowd-pleaser in the best way possible.\nBy far the most extraordinary aspects of this film is the visuals. The entire film looks like it's shot in one continuous long take. The cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (an Oscar winner for Gravity (2013)) keeps improving himself. His work is always magnificent and breathtaking. The dude is a real visual artist.\nAll of the performances are near-perfection. Michael Keaton knows exactly what he's doing. The actor himself was once popular as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Tim Burton's Dark Knight flicks, but hasn't done anything memorable ever since. Well, this will surely put him back on the map and he will be nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars. Edward Norton, who is a difficult actor to work with in real life, gives another award-caliber work as Mike, the volatile actor who drives Riggan banana. Emma Stone is an eye-opener as Riggan's daughter Sam, Zach Galifianakis is damn good as Jake, and Naomi Watts is solid as always\nBut still, the biggest achievement of Birdman is the way it presents itself. The movie knows it's taking the risk and how ambitious it is. You can feel it saying \"Come at me, bro!\" I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is a risk-taker but also a visionary director. Haters can piss off. If you are a true movie lover, buy a ticket and jump right in. And you won't regret it.",

            "content": "Serving as Michael Keaton's Academy Award nominated comeback film, Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) was too critically acclaimed to miss.\n\nTo say that I went into Birdman with high expectations is an understatement. With all its critical acclaim, I hoped that it would be a revolutionary experience. I definitely set my sights a bit high, but there is no doubt that Birdman is a brilliant film which really messed with my head.\nBirdman is a massive rush. The story in the film deals with so many themes in a confronting manner, ranging from dealing with deteriorating mental health so a sense of inferiority in the world and determination to stand up and make a change against the nihilism. The film jumps right into the material and in no time is able to establish the atmosphere as being intense and striking. This combines with the fast pace of the film to create a mesmerizing rush of an experience, for better and for worse. The hard hitting nature of the subject matter combined with the rapid pace of Birdman is sure to strike viewers, but it can also be overwhelming at times. While Birdman gives time for the subject matter to transition in, it jumps straight into the mood of the film and stays consistent with it to the end of the film. It is a very faced paced experience which can be overwhelming because at some times it rushes through scenes mercilessly. It doesn't leave any of the story out, but the manic energy in Birdman may weigh down on the viewers at points in the film. But while I felt this for moments of the film, as a whole, the experience of the feature was brilliant.\nThere were some moments when I was watching Birdman that I got so lost in the film that 10 minutes later I would stop and realize that I was sitting in a cinema. To be sucked into a film like that is an amazing thing, and for Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu to achieve that is amazing. Despite his films being rather popular, I have always had mixed to negative feelings about his works. After seeing Birdman, I have no doubt that he is a brilliant filmmaker. Birdman is a new high point for his career, a new standard of filmmaking which is just not something that anyone who likes movies can ever miss. The way that he contains the story even though it is such a psychotic one is very challenging to achieve, but he manages to do it. I just could not believe how much the film sucked me in because it is one that is so simple in story and yet so complicated in themes while maintaining certain stylistic elements of a stage production like the one that is chronicled in the story. There is a lot to take in from the film, and the extent that the viewer's brain can honestly fit in will determine how much they enjoy the film. I honestly feel that I walked away from Birdman with my brain having expanded because the images of the film still cloud my vision today. After seeing Birdman, there were times where the voice in my head actually made me feel like there was a a superhero alter ego of mine waiting behind me. That just goes to show how much Birdman can confront its viewers and strike them with relevance to their lives in any sort of way. There are a lot of things in Birdman that protagonist Riggan Thompson experiences that viewers will be able to connect to on some level which is what establishes him as a brilliantly likable protagonist and the hero that the story truly needs. The screenplay for Birdman is packed with all kinds of interesting characters and situations without ever seeming the slightest bit derivative or predictable.\nIn terms of technical characteristics, the cinematography in the film is particularly amazing. With its constant movements, it makes things seem like Birdman is shot in one continuous scene. With Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu choreographing the scenes to be long and filming them all in with the most time he can, Birdman is actually composed of only a few separate scenes if you look really closely. If you go out of your way to try and find the moments in the film where it is edited you may spo9t it, but if you just watch the film without trying to note that it is easy to miss because the execution is amazing. The cinematography in the film is consistent and takes a very claustrophobic angle during some of its most dramatic scenes to get up close and personal with the dramatic nature of the situations. It can sometimes feel like a bit close, but that really projects every little detail about the physical characteristics of the cast members, so it is clearly a major frontrunner for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. It also manages to capture the sights of the nice scenery and well placed production design which all manages to contribute to giving the film a sense of genuine feel for its intended setting. The small touch of visual effects is nice as well. The cinematography in the film really elevates the experience that little bit further, and so Birdman is an insightful and stylish affair.\nAnd with so much success built around them, the cast in Birdman give it their all and do nothing short of amazing efforts.\nI have respected Michael Keaton for a long time as he was always my favourite Batman aside from Adam West, so when I heard that Birdman featured a performance from him that later became nominated for an Academy Award I was overwhelmed with joy that the world was once again appreciating the talents that I have admired for so long. On the surface he is the perfect fit for the role of a once legendary star who portrayed a superhero as he played Bruce Wayne / Batman in Tim Burton's Batman films of 1989 and 1992. But much deeper down, he is perfect for the part because in the 25 years since he first donned Batman's armour, his career has faded. I never stopped liking him though, and so seeing him fly in Birdman pleases me on a very personal level. But the fact is that his performance is the greatest he has ever given, a second coming for the actor who is now in his 60's. You wouldn't be able to tell it from the film because his age does not stand in his way. His performance transcends age, he does not seem the least bit frail and has more energy in him than any other cast member. Coming back to reality and realising that he was a 63 year old actor was actually a shock because although I knew it for long, being reminded of that after seeing Birdman was quite surprising. Michael Keaton grasps the heroic flight of his superhero character Birdman and puts all the passion in the world into the role, grasping it with a mean tenacity which captures some startling moments of affecting emotional drama and others which are generally hilarious. He never misses his mark for a second and is able to hold the screen the entire time whenever he is on it by pulling his soul out and showing it for everyone. His performance is raw with shocking strength, and arguably one of the greatest performances of 2014. Michael Keaton turns Birdman from the tale of redemption into a real life story of redemption by bringing attention to his career which has laid dormant for way too long, and to see the actor who once played the titular character from Beetlejuice delivering the number one performance worthy of the Academy Award for Best Actor. \nEdward Norton just blew me away in Birdman. The once legendary actor who has scored Two Academy Award nominations in his career delivers his finest performance in years for Birdman, a performance which is undoubtedly worthy of its Academy Award nomination. His role fits him because it fits the profile that people give of him as a control freak while also reinvigorating his status as a legandary actor by giving him the deep and complex but egotistical character of Mike Shiner. He remembers his lines seamlessly well and is able to vary in dramatic strength incredibly well when the situations demand it from him. He goes through moments of being so into character that it is infuriating but he also has the ability to touch audiences, and his tense chemistry with Michael Keaton is a brutal battle for the spotlight in which the winner is constantly varying while his interactions with Emma Stone are far more gentle. Edward Norton is a brilliant actor and we all know that, but Birdman demands the most out of him since his debut performance in Primal Fear, and he takes his talents one step further to ensure that he is clearly a viable asset to the film's success.\nEmma Stone delivers her finest performance to date. While still maintaining the status of a young and innocent girl, Emma Stone uses all the skills she has spent years progressing in since she first came to prominence in 2006's Superbad to deliver a performance of exceptional theatrical talent. Her character is not given as much depth as the others, but she remains incredible based on the chemistry that she shares with Michael Keaton and Edward Norton. She is up front and brutal in some of her scenes with Michael Keaton and is able to deliver her lines with their comedic or dramatic nature all without flinching, being mercilessly dramatic without stepping into melodrama. She really puts herself out there in a very bold performance which is so admirable for her, and it is the endeavour of her career. As a person who has been watching Emma Stone since her career first took off, seeing her reach the heights she does in Birdman is a wonderful thing to experience. Emma Stone breaks new ground in Birdman, and it is beautiful to behold.\nZach Galifiniakis is also brilliant in Birdman. The actor mostly known for his work in the Hangover trilogy delivers a brilliant supporting effort in Zach Galifiniakis which shows him working with subtle humour and hard hitting drama which he manages to work out easily. He is funny, but I expected that. What I was surprised by was the level of dramatic depth he was able to reach and his astounding chemistry with Michael Keaton. His brief appearance in Birdman shows him pushing all his emotions into the part and coming out shining. Birdman left me encouraged to hope Zach Galifiniakis would tackle more dramatic material in the future and confident that he would be able to succeed at doing it, so Birdman also gives his career a step forward.\nAmy Ryan, Naomi Watts and Lindsay Duncan also bring strength to their appearances.\n\nSo although Birdman can be an overwhelming film, the pure brilliance in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's directorial style and handling of the material mixed with revolutionary performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton makes it one of the finest films of 2014 and a sure frontrunner for the Academy Award for Best Actor.",

Michael Keaton provides a career-revival performance that is placing him on my top list (as of now) for best actor because he just hits a homerun! The rest of cast, including Emma Stone and Edward Norton, deliver outstanding performances as well. The whole cast, just great, great, great!\n\nI must say, this film is not for everyone. It is weird, style and substance, but I found myself connecting with the film on a deeper level than expected. I loved the characters, loved the commentary, and freaking loved the style. \n\n\"Birdman\" is not the best film of year, but it is an engrossing, engaging, and an extraordinary film that balances the drama and comedy so well. Filled with wonderful performances, brilliant imagery, and is simply a film that proudly stands as the most unique film experience of the year.",

It's a juicy look at the inner workings of the performance industry and it displays the brazen stereotypes that come with it but with a deeper look into what creates those stereotypes. Emma Stone just might've earned a best supporting actress nod with her angry monologue directed towards her father (Keaton). And speaking of Mr. Keaton; unabashed, surreal, real, and arguably his best work. I loved watching him jump to and fro emotionally and physically. Edward Norton tap danced beautifully around every character in Birdman bringing out the best and the worst in them. Great acting and beautiful long shots that probably was the catalyst for the great acting. Such a lovely piece of cinema, right there, ahuh.",

The similarities between  Keaton's and Riggan's careers only add another layer to this already we'll put together and crafted script.

It was quite unsettling since film cuts and fades are usually quite evident, occuring every minute or so. For example, the camera \"followed\" every character down every hallway which provides a sense of realism and a feeling that you're standing there with them as part of the crew, but also a quick route to motion sickness. The technical achievement in this film is undoubtedly great, but it's not as enjoyable for the viewer. Another example is that without cuts, when two people are talking the camera spends the entire time focused on just one person and you miss the other's reactions. \n\nAnyway, the story itself is fine, but didn't grip me the way I wanted it to. Keaton and Norton were excellent and backed up by nice work from Stone and the rest.  Perhaps the blame for my dissatisfaction is on its artsy directing style.

            "content": "http://pressplayrewind.com/birdman-review/\n\nIn general, I try to know as little as possible about a film before screening it. If I've done a good job, I won't even know who is starring in the film or anything about its plot. When I screened Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) all I knew going in was that it starred Michael Keaton and apparently that the movie had been shot entirely in one take. Seeing Keaton interested me, because other than a fairly meaty role in the RoboCop reboot earlier this year and few supporting roles over the last several years, we haven't see much of him, and definitely not as a leading man. But let's be honest, the real draw to this movie is the manner in which it was filmed; if the filmmaking team really pulled off a complete movie in one take, that is a movie worth seeing. But more on that later.\n\nNow, with my butt firmly in the seat, I was ready for anything. From the opening scene with Keaton, it is obvious that we are in for a unique vision. The elevator pitch of movie goes something like this: washed-up Hollywood action star tries to gain some artistic street cred by moving to New York City and starring in a broadway show that is adapted, produced, and directed by him; along the way, he deals with a myriad of problems ranging from financial to personal to professional. The onscreen development of these issues and how he attempts to address them are the crux of this entertaining and engaging story. However, like most films worth watching, that is not really what this film is about.\n\nBirdman isn't really so much a story to be heard, but a work of art to be experienced. Mexican born director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Babel, 21 Grams, Biutiful) attempts to push the boundaries of convention; metaphorically, as part of the story and literally through the way film was conceived and executed on a practical and technical level, as one \"continuous\" shot. To be clear, the film was not actually shot in one sitting. The filmmakers employed a number of techniques (including computer generated effects) to create the illusion of a single continuous tracking shot, but for at least the first quarter of the film, I was fooled, and for its entirely, I was hooked. In the vast majority of movies out there, editors cut back and forth often. Sometimes the cuts are integral to the plot or artistry of the work, but just as often they are there to cover flubs in performances, to fix issues that occurred on set, or to cover up the fact that a scene was too long and stretches of dialogue needed to be tighten up. Because of this, I sometimes find myself not paying as close attention as I could be to what I'm watching or, just as often, oddly placed cuts distract me and take me out of the moment. This is not possible with Birdman. The continuous, nonstop nature of the movie makes you afraid to blink or look away, even for a second, for fear of missing out on something crucial. There is no such thing as \"b-roll\" in this movie - every frame is important and shouldn't be missed.\n\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu is not the only director to attempt to make a movie in the continuous style. In 1948, Alfred Hitchcock attempted the same thing with Rope, starring Jimmy Stewart. While Rope is one of the more interesting in Hitchcock's catalogue of films, the uninterrupted filming technique was not nearly as effective then as is here. Rope is a claustrophobic feeling that is more akin to the filming of a stage play than an typical big screen film. Birdman, however, despite taking place on stage and backstage at a Broadway theater, is a film that thrives on the big screen and succeeds in all the ways that Hitchcock didn't or couldn't (due to technological restrictions) when he made Rope.\n\nWhile the film achieves much from a technical perspective, it would have all been for naught had he not entrusted his script to the talented actors and charged them with bringing the characters to life. There isn't a false note among the cast, which includes in addition to Keaton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, and Edward Norton, all of whom give career-defining performances. However, the real credit must be given, once again, to I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. The kind of vision and bravely that it takes to make and succeed at making what must be called an experimental art film is something that we see very rarely from even the most lauded American directors. I honestly hope the film succeeds at the box office this weekend and during awards season next year to encourage more of this kind of bravery, something the industry desperately needs.",

Keaton gives his career best, strongly complemented by the thespian chops of a talented ensemble - Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts.

This is the type of film that one waits for all year and it embodies the true art of film. This is a masterpiece from beginning to end and from the opening scene you are enthralled with this story and not for one second can u take your eyes away from the screen. From its extremely strong plot and its intriguing social narrative about Hollywood and the state of movie making today. Also the way this movie is shot truly is a sight to see and a true achievement in cinema. From about two minutes in to the last 2 minutes of the film it is made to look like it never cuts and it is just one long shot. This was masterfully done by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and puts him seriously in contention for an Oscar this year. Above all of this one really keeps this story so entertaining and this film so great is the remarkable performances from all the actors involved. Michael Keaton gives maybe the performance of his career and will likely win him and Oscar. Emma Stone gives a very powerful performance along with Naomi Watts. In my personal opinion though Ed Norton has the strongest performance in this movie and steals every scene he is a part of.  Another surprise performance in this film though is Zach Galifianakis who goes a turn for the dramatic and gives the best performance of his career. The only real complaint I have about this film is that the end left me a little cold and I think that it should have ended a little earlier than it did. Other than that I do not have anything bad to say about this movie it is a great film that I can honestly say is an experience and an experience worth having in the theater at that. 4.5/5",

It was really funny, really well written, really well shot, and really well acted. Michael Keaton was fantastic! He was really awesome to watch and to see how he is dual sided with becoming Birdman once again. He chooses between what he wants to become and show people what he can be and what he used to be. Throughout the movie the Birdman image kinda haunts him and acts sort of like a devil to an angel sort of way. Edward Norton was really great as the cocky show person. Based on the way he acts it really is a spot on look of how actors can be (stubborn especially). The camera angles and the way it's shot is amazing. It was super creative to make it look as if it it were one big scene in one. I really didn't want it to end, it was beautiful! The soundtrack was really cool too! I loved all the drumming and how they would include him in some scenes. This movie just really sucked me in and really affected the way I view movies and criticize film (hence the critic scene). In the end, Birdman was hilarious, emotional, moving, thoughtful, and awesome. A",

            "content": "Time is not kind. Time is the one thing we can't seem to make more of and yet the only thing, when it really comes down to it, that we could ever hope to gain. Birdman is about the moments in life when it really comes down to it. When everything in life seems so fleeting, materialistic or fake and we have a second of clarity that defines what is really important to us, what makes this existence worth enduring and even why we want to exist in the first place. Birdman is a character study wrapped in social commentary about the current state of cinema as well as a love letter written in blood to the idea of legacy. There are millions of avenues one could run down when it comes to telling a story about the basic experience of being human and those moments that define who we are, who we become or who we want to be despite our actions. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (21 Grams, Babel) is interested in the moments that make up a personality and the effect or contribution that personality has on society, but he also wants to make a few other notions clear in the process. The guy hates comic book movies, clearly, or at least hates that they have become the cornerstone of the modern cinematic experience. It is hard to find fault in this opinion with as strong a case as his film makes, but then again this can all be perceived as pretentious and taking things too seriously since most comic book films have no intentions other than being escapism for the masses. As much as Birdman incorporates the world of super heroes and comic book movies into its structure to make a larger point the film is ultimately about the difference in love and admiration and how the quest to feel \"special\" will likely only leave you empty if you disregard those closest to you for personal gain and have no one to celebrate with when that gain puts you at the top of the mountain. Needless to say, there is a lot going on in Birdman. Both on the screen in front of you and as larger analogies Inarritu's film has a lot on its mind and is primarily so successful because it is so capable of conveying this multitude of thoughts and ideas in an entertaining and insightful manner.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.net",

The director has clearly a define vision of what he wants out of his team and get it readily and religiously accomplished. This is a concept film and you will either be transported by the whole piece or left out, but I must confess I have a hard time to see how anyone would dislike such a film... but tastes are different and I could see how some people would feel lost by the camera work for example who gives such a frenzy and erratic pace to the film. I can't praise enough the technician here, the lights, the costumes, the make up and the actors are all superb. A.G.

The film has many great themes of feeling worthless, people either being too caught up with the latest trends rather or being too stigmatizing of the \"Birdman\" persona to give him a fair chance (thought to be fair while vague labeling and bias is a bad way too critique movies I wouldn't exactly say the majority of movie critics are necessarily \"out to get\" certain filmmakers), and stress getting the best of your relationships witg loved ones (though I'm not sure if the hypocrisy of Keaton's character continuing to drink his life away and even trying a joint of Emma Stoned (I'm sorry I had to) was intentionally hypocritical, him trying to make a better outcome for her than how he's turned out, or neither). \"Birdman\" is like the lemon meringue pie of 2014 movies; an intriguingly sour reality frosted with sweet comedic moments on the top.

You will either love it or you will hate it, and I think a lot of that has to do with how much you can relate to the lead character who is struggling to find himself. The film is shot so that nearly the entire movie looks like a single take. This could prove divisive, as audiences who are not used to long takes may feel that the film drags, as there are no quick cuts to break up the dialogue. Not only that, but some viewers may find it hard to follow, as you are dropped in the middle of the situation, without much context and a bevy of characters thrown at you. These are all just more reasons to love it though. The director isn't there to hold your hand. The film feels raw and rather profound. It doesn't use cinematic norms to ease audiences into situations and that is for the better. I can highly recommend this film to those who are looking for something different, something that deserves the attention of film critics and audiences alike. Some may not like it, but I was both highly entertained and intellectually stimulated. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "There are a plethora of movies that come out each year that you adore, but there are only a few that you admire.  It's rare that a film both audacious and outrageous can hit the mainstream with arty enthusiasm, but \"Birdman\" has conspicuously done it.  It's a comeback story.  It's a game changer for a bevy of its actors.  It has the daring of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" or \"A Woman Under the Influence.\" I may not have loved it with my entirety, but \"Birdman\" contains those rare juices that can only be found in the vintage days of pioneering filmmaking.\n\tRiggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) was a huge actor 20 years ago, but these days, he's carrying the weight of a has-been.  Like Keaton, Riggan was the star of a huge superhero franchise, the Birdman series (meta enough for you yet?).  But after turning town another unnecessary sequel, Riggan hasn't found another role that has given him as much notability or respect.\n\tNow middle-aged and balding, he's decided to reinvent his lagging career by adapting and starring in Raymond Carver's \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" on the daunting Broadway stage.  But the production is plagued with difficulties.  Riggan's daughter (Emma Stone), who works as his assistant, is fresh from rehab and close to destroying her life once again; one of the actors (Edward Norton), who is extremely Method and without modesty, causes disastrous previews; but worst of all, Riggan is slightly schizophrenic, taunted by the voices of his past.\n\tThere's a theater critic (Lindsay Duncan) in the film who is serpent-like and acidic in her speech; she later describes Riggan's play as having a sort of \"hyper-realism\".  \"Birdman\" is filmed as though it were shot in one extreme take, one that fancies close-ups and uncomfortable angles.  It heightens the tragicomic values the film portrays, and that \"hyper-realism\" becomes a truth.  \"Birdman\" manages to feel both theatrical and mold-on-the-ceiling authentic.\n\tStylistically, it's a very challenging film to embrace with a whole heart.  Its cinematography is so specific and so bold that it sometimes distracts from the dialogue, as we are forced to adjust to a lens we so rarely see in the movies.  Movies hardly ever, if ever, choose to photograph a film with \"Birdman\"'s take-it-or-leave-it one-shot valor.  If it isn't always successful, it's consistently interesting, and frequently takes the wickedness of the film to entirely new levels.  Its accompanying, brilliant soundtrack, which mostly consists of flashy, jazzy drum beats, matches the whiplashed unpredictably the film flaunts.  \n\tI\u00f1\u00e1rritu's direction is unflinching, everlastingly inventive and risk-taking.  If he, along with the cinematography and score, aren't nominated for Oscars, they will surely be robbed.  Certainly, there isn't anything beautiful or lavish about the film (like many of the other potential nominees), but the distinct, harsh landscape is jaggedly excellent. \n\tAs the film closed and the actors' names flashed across the screen with a Jean-Luc Godard fashion, I couldn't help but feel the tizzy the Academy will be in in a few months.  Keaton has never given a better performance, and no one else this year will either.  Stone smashes the roof off of any preconceived notions about her \"type\"; so has Galifianakis.  Watts frequently steals scenes and is reminiscent of her powerful characterizations in \"Mulholland Dr.\"  Norton is ruthless yet surprisingly philosophical; Riseborough is a bonfire of energy.  And Ryan, who seems to get crushed under the names of the note-worthy cast, brings a whole new spectrum of light and salvation to Keaton's character.\n\tWill I see a film this year that deserves as much praise as \"Birdman\" does? Probably not.  I have yet to see a film so technically terrific or so impactful in its performances.  If only it was a little warmer, a little less stylistically strong.  But it won't matter.  \"Birdman\" is a blessing in this day in age.",

It's a black comedy about a washed-up actor who is trying to make a comeback by writing, directing and starring in a play that is based on a Raymond Carver short story. The main gimmick of \"Birdman\" is that you get the feeling that you are watching a two-hour film shot in one continuous take. Our main character of \"Birdman\" is played by Michael Keaton in the performance of his career.\n\n\"Birdman\" or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is about a washed-up actor named Riggan Thomson (Keaton) who used to play an iconic superhero named Birdman in three blockbuster movies. More than 20 years after he left his multi-billion-dollar franchise, Riggan vows to make a comeback by writing, directing and starring in a play. What is it? It's an adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". The play stars Riggan, a capricious Broadway actor named Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), a first-time actress named Lesley (Naomi Watts) and Riggan's girlfriend, Laura (Andrea Riseborough).\n\nRiggan's daughter, Sam (Emma Stone) serves as his assistant and the play is produced by Riggan's best friend, Jake (Zach Galifianakis) who is also his lawyer. Sam just got out of rehab for drug addiction and she has an emotional confrontation with his father. She tells him that he, like the rest of the world, don't matter. Riggan soon reads the early reviews and they are scathing but it does nothing to stop him from making his play a success. From time to time, Riggan hears a voice in his head, it's the voice of Birdman either mocking him or bolstering his image.\n\n\"Birdman\" is an ambitiously technical achievement by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. He previously made \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\", both movies had interweaving plot lines and characters who were surrounded by the consequences of tragedy. With his new film, he seems to be having fun with his Hollywood satire. Keaton (who previously played Batman in two movies) gives a terrific performance as a failing actor who used to play an iconic superhero. Edward Norton gives his best performance in years as the brilliant but sometimes crazy Shiner and Emma Stone is outstanding as Riggan's daughter. Zach Galifianakis who gets stuck in the middle of this madness gives a strong supporting performance as Riggan's best friend and manager and Naomi Watts is also very good as a first-time actress.\n\nInarritu has made a challenging high-wire act and the result is one of the best movies of 2014. I see the flood of Oscar nominations already for \"Birdman\" especially a nomination for Michael Keaton in the role of a lifetime.",

A dark comedy, what can be better than that? A lot has been said about the movie, it clinched the titles of best feature & best director at Academy Awards as well so I will keep it short. Birdman is the story of falling down in an infinite abyss of darkness. It hurts so much that at one point you just want to put a barrier on your way and crash into it. Keaton's outstanding approach to the main character puts everything else away, he was simply brilliant! Supporting cast including Edward Norton, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Stone, Lindsay Duncan, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan and Naomi Watts were more than good in their respective roles. Cinematography is another point where Birdman excelled, the jerky handheld shots captured the finer nuances of the tumultuousness of main characters with grandeur. An excellent work of cinema, most recommended and worthy of all the awards it had won and more!",

It demands your full attention and though it's characters aren't that memorable, nor is the story overall, though very layered and self depicting all round.\n\nIt didn't live up to the hype for me personally, the filmmaking is fantastic but the overall package lacked the punches where scenes such as Keaton confronting his critics both literally and metaphorically are the films highlights. \n\nOscar worthy performances all round, artistically brilliant but far too between with it's most showy sequences that could have been more used frequently, makes it not live up to the hype for me.",

This film I believe deserves the best cinematography Oscar over interstellar even though I really enjoyed that film to. Now to talk about next I have to say not only is the film a great ensemble but almost all of the performances are highlights for the year. It can be laugh out loud witty funny and can be depressing the next this film is easily one of the best of the year and quite possibly the best.\nMichael Keaton's acting was a very pleasant surprise as well as Emma stone and Edward Norton along side him in the film. So I wouldn't be surprised to see this film winning some best acting nods at the Oscars. The most pleasant surprise is that this is the best comedy I've seen a long while, it's pretty dark at time but is overall a comedy/drama and it seems to me that these two genres were blended perfectly.In conclusion there isn't anything bad I can think of to say about it. So I call this one of the definite must sees of the year. This film could be enjoyed by almost anyone. If you don't like dark comedies then I guess that would ruin your enjoyment but if you at the very least don't mind a dark comedy then you will most likely enjoy it. I hope you enjoy it to the extent I did and end up not wasting your time like I did. That's all and thanks for reading my review.",

Keaton is long been one of my favorites, ever since Beetlejuice and I for one, was excited when he was chosen for Batman. Of course, I was 11 and I didn't read comics book yet. In fact, Michael Keaton's Batman was the birth of my now 26 year love affair with printed word accompanied by pretty pictures. Batman is what Michael will always be known for, Birdman is what he will be remembered for. He better win that Oscar(him or Benedict Cumberbatch or Eddie Redmayne, Damn so many good ones this year!) because he is phenomenal as Riggen Thompson, an aging actor known for playing a superhero on the big screen. Yeah, may not seem like a stretch but is there anyone more perfect? How about if we get a guy who was fired from being a superhero after turning in a pretty good performance as one? Edward Norton, famously replaced as the Hulk(of course he was replaced by Mark Ruffalo so no one complained understandably so) still, he probably deserved another shot. The only reason no one is talking about how good Norton is here, is because how fucking good Keaton is! The very first scene between these two, about 15 -20 minutes in, I knew that I was in for something special. I really want them to work together again. Emma Stone, Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis  and Amy Ryan all turn in fine supporting performances as well. By far Alejandro G. Inarritu's finest film and definitely my favorite of his. I counted only 2 cuts. Maybe. Either way, the movie is done in pretty much one shot until it's climatic moment and it is fantastic filmmaking from every one involved. Trust me when I say, it takes an army to get what you see onscreen and this one worked very well together. This is up there with my faves of the year, which if you haven't been keeping track are Guardians, Apes, Imitation Game, John Wick, Fury, Theory Of Everything.",

The lighting and positions of the actors allowed multiple plots and stories to be occurring in one shot.  Beautiful editing.\n The film itself is a look into the lives of people who struggle with identity, with truth; confusing who they are with what they are, or what they were.  Reality is ignored and the self is praised.  By doing this, Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu presents the audience with the fallacies that one encounters by rejecting reality.  But, as the title suggests, ignorance my bypass these fallacies. Ignorance might just be a virtue.\n\nHonestly, this is one of those films that you'll either love or hate.  I wouldn't recommend it to a casual movie goer who's looking for a good movie on a night out.  This is a film for those who like to think and analyze film.",

            "content": "This is a film that has gotten so much praise this awards season, and is at the top of most people's top ten films of the year lists. I've been waiting so long to see this movie, that most people have probably seen it by now. Writing a review for this won't be easy. It's one of the most bizarre film's I've seen this year, while also one of the best movies I may have seen in my life. I slept on it, and I think I'm ready now. \"Birdman\" is directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and stars an impressive cast including: Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, Amy Ryan, and Naomi Watts.\n\nRiggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is a washed up actor who used to be known as a superhero action star named Birdman. Over the years, his career dwindled, and he is now attempting to direct a play on Broadway. His girlfriend Laura (Riseborough) acts in the play as well, and his daughter Sam (Stone) works as his assistant. During rehearsal, a light falls on one of the actors, and Riggan must find a replacement. He brings in Mike (Norton), a very talented, yet very arrogant actor to replace him. Riggan struggles to validate his life and career, all while Birdman continues to taunt him in his mind.\n\nMichael Keaton received a nomination for Best Actor in this film, and he really did deserve it. While not an earth shattering performance, it is the best of his entire career. The cast assembled here is perfect. Edward Norton gives a great performance, and Emma Stone, wow! I'm not a big fan of her, but she really delivers in this. She defiantly has acting chops and I look forward to see what she does next. The performances are all noteworthy and impressive. Secondly, the script is phenomenal! Every bit of dialogue was clever. It did't even feel like dialogue, it was so natural.\n\nThis is an art film. Everything about it screams creativity. The cinematography for one is so inventive. Emmanuel Lubezki shot and edited this film in a way that seems like it's one long take. It's literally one long tracking shot. This helps the film feel more natural. It gives it this seamless feel; it's flowing and relentless. It's probably the most original cinematography I've seen in a while. I also love how the movie stands up against the film industry. It slams mindless big action films like Transformers, and challenges audiences to think. It challenges one to think about movies, about life, and about who you are. If you are a moviegoer. a good person, a bad person, or some film critic, no matter who you are, this film gets in your face and tells you the honest truth. It challenges one to own up to who you are and the mistakes you've made.  \n\n\"Birdman\" is a movie made up of many factors, and it talks about many different things. It's about your career, it's about love, family, friendship, acting, film-making, film critics, and it's about what it means to be a human being. It touches on so many different emotions; sadness, joy, love, and humor. It's a creative art film and is superb on every level of movie making. I can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie. It's a film that everyone can get something out of, and in my opinion, it's a modern masterpiece.",

Mexican director Alejandro Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu faultlessly crafts Birdman, a film that appears as one long tracking shot, using clever filmmaking skills to pull off the remarkable style.  Michael Keaton makes an incredible comeback in a momentous performance that deserves all of the praise and awards that it's sure to garner, but it's Edward Norton who steals the show with a paramount performance that perfectly encapsulates what the actor is really like.

            "content": "The film opens with a shot of Michael Keaton sitting cross legged in a pair of white underpants, hovering about a metre off the floor. And thus begins an awkward relationship between filmmaker and audience, as difficult as each relationship between the characters of the play. For the film is a play, as the full title of the film (Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) requires us to note, and the theatre within the film represents reality. \n\nThe opening moment of supernatural magic sets the scene for a film about a superhero. A quiet moment of solitude where our protagonist reflects on his condition. It's a standard scene in the genre. Here is one superhero who wonders how he got to this place. A place that smells of balls. What is this place? The Earth or this brick walled room? Or a state of mind? And are we talking about the balls barely concealed by his present attire? Or, metaphorically, the condition of mediocrity?\n\nBut that opening moment of wonder that the filmmaker has given us is fake. He isn't asking us, after all, to suspend our disbelief, as is required in viewing action adventures. We don't, at first, have any way of knowing this, since the play of the film is focalised on Thomas Riggan. Did the stage light fall because of his superpowers? Why doubt it, they haven't been called into question. Not yet. \n\nIt isn't until after Mike Shiner tells us \"popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige\" that the filmmaker reveals that those powers are the illusion of a fragile mind. A fading mind whose life work has been dedicated to creating popular entertainment for the audiences which, in turn, prefer to escape reality through fantasy than confront the painful truths of life. Admit it, I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu demands, you were childishly drawn in by the magical fiction. And now we are to feel both wonderment and embarrassment at each delightful instance of fantasy. \n\nI\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu isn't done mocking us yet. The relationship between daughter, underplayed with poise by Emma Stone, and her father stems from his failings, namely, as she tells us, he wasn't around and then tried to make up for it by trying to make her feel special. A line delivered without melodrama that confronts each member of the audience to reassess the true extent of one's parents' shortcomings. \n\nOn the other hand, I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu helps us a little, signposting the role of the theatre within the film as the description of some sort of reality. As an aside, who doesn't come away wanting to explore the works of Raymond Carver? The description of a man trying and failing to take his life is echoed in Riggan's story delivered to his ex-wife about his own failed suicide attempt. A story that is both bathetic and ridiculous. I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu chooses black comedy over slapstick, having his protagonist tell the story, rather than film it. Instead he shows a beautiful shot of the beach with the seagulls pecking at the helpless corpses of the washed up jellyfish. This is a modern film noir. \n\nI wanted to see something positive in this story, an allegory of how unbearable pain helped ironically to avoid total destruction and led to a new beginning. But no. Riggan heads out to take his life again failing spectacularly and ridiculously. And yet to the immediate onlookers, and those connected through the fantastical nature of a world of social media, his failure is misinterpreted as an act of heroism. In today's currency, heroism is measured in the number of views on YouTube or followers on Twitter. \n\nAffixed on Riggan's mirror is a small card which says: \"a thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing\". Riggan lambasts the Times critic for the lazy application of commonplace labels. I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu urges us to work harder, to think harder.",

            "content": "In one of the year's best films, one of the year's best ensemble casts takes on one of the year's best screenplays under one of the year's most ambitious directorial projects and one of the year's greatest achievements in cinematography. Birdman is a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience that works in so many ways that it's difficult to comprehend how the team pulled it off so well. Filmed in what is meant to look like pretty much one continuous shot, Birdman is an incredible stunt and change-of-pace for director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and the insanely talented cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, but what makes it even greater is that it is in no way just a stunt, but a full-fledged story with a screenplay that blends sharp dialogue with big ideas, pulled together by great performances.\n\tNo moviegoing experience is quite the same as Birdman. The single shot gives the film a unique feel that makes it difficult to recall when watching a film has felt this way before. Without relying on any editing, it trashes the conventions of how we see dialogue exchanged, the way we see people navigate a room, and the way we see characters interact with others and their environment. To watch this pulled off so well made me question the necessities of conventional editing and wonder why filmmakers so rarely use this technique of long takes to tell a story. So much could potentially go wrong with the actors having none of it to rely on, especially in sequences where humor is crucial to the story. In such scenes it actually works better than it would with cuts because it feels more raw, less timed, less begging of the audience for laughs, and credit is certainly due to the actors for being able to take advantage of the technique. The style even seems to serve a larger purpose. The film is about a play and the style parallels that of an uncut play, loosening the boundaries between what is on stage and what is off stage. Even the magic of this shot adds to the fantastical elements of the film. On top of it all, Emmanuel Lubezki's camerawork is consistently beautiful and fluid in both motion and composition.\n\tBirdman wouldn't be the success it is were it not build on top of a great screenplay. The dialogue is, line after line, witty, smart, and purposeful. It's funny when it wants to be, dramatic when it needs to be, and always playful, blending all sorts of tones in between. Never are the important pieces like family struggles forgotten. At its core, it is about the blurred lines between our self and our ego, and it constantly establishes and develops this through several motifs such as art, the celebrity, and even social media. It asks us where we exist.\n\tMichael Keaton leads the cast with a performance that is both subtle and over-the-top. He never forgets why his character is fighting and nails every bit of comedy, insanity, and humanity. Edward Norton is a total standout who brings a lot of laughs to the film in a dimensional role as a dick. Emma Stone shows a lot of versatility, and Zach Galifianakis and Naomi Watts also have performances worth mentioning. As I said earlier, all actors deserve credit for making the uncut camera style work so well.\n\tEvery element of film is at the highest order here, including the unique drum score from Antonio Sanchez, and it all amounts to one of the most original films of the past few years, or ever. And maybe Bridman is not a perfect movie, but that doesn't stop it from being fantastic (AND FLYING/SOARING HIGH GET IT BECAUSE BIRDMAN). What I might not have mentioned is that it's a whole lot of fun, and it's an experience I want to have again/FLY WITH AGAIN BECAUSE BIRDMAN.",

Life says \"fuck you\" and traps you in the bird's nest, maimed and unable to fly, that is, until you test your wings.\n\nThe film is very ambitious, and the director casts a spell of \"magic realism\" (okay so I copied and pasted this term from another review but it sounded good) that essentially takes the best aspects from both film and theater.  It becomes hypnotizing to the point where it feels as if The Wrestler and Black Swan had an out-of-wedlock baby.  Although the theme has been explored before, I really enjoyed how the introspection and emotion were played out, perfectly portrayed by the cast.  On one layer, you start examining the egoism of human nature in general and how Michael Keaton, one of the most versatile actors decades ago, must have felt when he declined in relevancy.  Another layer back, you start questioning the futility of self-importance altogether. \n\nDo yourself a favor and experience the spectacle.  Jump, fly, whatever.  Just be sure to paint yourself a nest to land on.",

Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography only exemplifies this.The brilliant choice of always having the camera rolling lets the viewer see what happens before and after any given event.\nInarritu made the choice to give \"Birdman\" an alternate title.That title is: \"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.\" I think that fits perfectly.",

Even going as far as the main character's alter ego stating that people now a days prefer grand explosions and flare over talking. Not many will enjoy this film as it can get very meta and philosophical, those who will enjoy it will absolutely love it. The film is also shot as if it is all one long shot which is a rare and very appealing thing to see.

The cast is good but the great performances came from Zach Galifinakis and Naomi Watts but they needed a little more to do to really grab attention for the awards buzz. The buzz is mostly going for Keaton who gave a good performance but by no means an award worthy one, Norton who does a great job and out of the three getting attention is the most deserving, and Stone who I love always but she didn't do anything new to warrant any awards attention really. The more important thing to talk about this movie is the tec aspects like the directing, cinematography, and editing that makes this movie seem like it is shot all in one take but it really isn't. Though at times the camera work got in the way of seeing another character's reaction because you could not cut away or it would ruin the whole stunt, it works for the most part and makes you forget about it after a while. The music is very good especially the flying scene. Some of the more fantasy moments worked at time and others especially towards the end just got crazy for me. The ending starts to get repetitive and I thought this movie lasted a lifetime long but it is only 2 hours so that amazed me. Merritt Wever also has a great little part as the stage manager and Amy Ryan adds some nice moments as Keaton's ex wife. My biggest issue was the writing of the critic character because her purpose was a plot device to bring down Keaton's spirits and in the real world that critic would be fired. Should I be judging logic on this movie? Not really since Keaton channels his Birdman powers throughout but that just really threw me off. But I will say Lindsey Duncan that played the critic did a good job for what she had to work with. It is funny especially Norton's character but I wouldn't say it is the funniest movie of the year. There was an odd sub plot between Norton and Stone that just lost focus for me and just seemed like it happened to piss off Keaton's character but they were nice and sweet moments in a really eccentric movie so I can't really complain too much about them. Overall, I enjoyed the creativity of the movie, the look into the theater world, and the tec work, I liked this but it didn't blow me out of this world.",

Birdman balances the micro and macro of human relationships, ambition, failure, our own bloated egos and the film/theatre industry itself - and it's wonderful.\n\nAs a massive fan of Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's work, my levels of expectation going in were high. They were met! Always so brilliant at analysing character, Inarritu begins our journey with Riggan (An Best Lead Actor Oscar lock for what is a career high performance) the way he means to go on; with a man battling with his inflated ego and self importance in surreal splendor. It doesn't ever let up.\n\nThe way almost the entire film is stitched together as one continuous shot helps bridge that gap between theatre and film, and it's visually stunning and impressive. Through this roller-coaster Riggan has to deal with various issues concerning the opening of his play - his last chance to do something with \"meaning\" - all the while dealing with the almost farcical moral crises of those around him. It's hilarious, engrossing and at times very profound. \n\nThe cast is uniformly brilliant. Keaton will certainly be short-listen come Academy Award season, but don't be surprised if Ed Norton sneaks in there too. He hasn't been this good since Down in the Valley. Everyone gets their chance to shine as we glimpse fleeting moments of utter despair, elation or frustration grasp their characters.\n\nIt's a film with great scope and depth.The layered story is captivating, delivered in virtuoso fashion by a master director. Don't be surprised if this is 2015's Best Picture and/or Best Director winner. I haven't been so satisfied by such a beautiful or unique movie in years. It's something of a masterpiece and easily in my top five favourite films of all time.\n\n*Review Pending*",

            "content": "Although it may not be the fully transcendent masterpiece some have made it out to be, BIRDMAN is still clearly one of the best films of 2014, packed full of great performances, sharp, biting writing, and several bravura moments.  On a technical level, the movie is spectacular, with camerawork that is often unbelievably good; there's just something incredibly compelling about extended takes, and the seamless nature of the editing allow the scenes to flow together beautifully and - often - without detectable cuts.  The filmmaking itself would be enough to make BIRDMAN a must-see, but there's even more to it than that.  It's a movie that's equal parts satire, farce, and treatise on fame (or past fame) and the \"craft\" of acting; the screenplay mines these aspects for all they're worth, but the movie never feels pretentious or weighed down by its thematic concerns.  To put it a different way, it's a film with serious things on its mind that doesn't take itself (too) seriously; there's a lightness of touch on display.  The movie's also interesting in the way it presents its (very heightened) look at the pressures of mounting a big time, serious Broadway play.  Michael Keaton is - justifiably - the man of the hour, here, and it's a remarkable performance, one where he metaphorically leaves it all on the field.  It feels like a hungry performance, and I mean that in the best way possible; it's some of the best work he's ever done.  He's surrounded by a fantastic ensemble (all the cast members seem to be having a ton of fun, perhaps energized by the long takes), particularly Edward Norton - in a delightful skewering of the cliched persona of the \"Broadway actor\" - and Emma Stone, who is perhaps the strongest she's ever been, displaying outward cynicism and fire, but also a slightly more soulful inner life which is eventually coaxed to the surface.  The more ambiguous nature of some of the goings-on might not work for some people, but overall I found BIRDMAN to be as finely-crafted a work of cinema as I saw in all of 2014.  This is an outstanding movie.",

            "content": "Riggan: I'm nothing. I'm not even here.\n\nThe story to Birdman is about an wash up actor (Michael Keaton) - famous for portraying an iconic superhero - as he struggles to mount a Broadway play. In the days leading up to opening night, he battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career, and himself.\n\nOkay in my review of Whiplash I bought this movie up mid way through the review just to give a heads up of when I'm going to watch it, because Birdman was my most hyped film of 2014. But just like every time I really wanted to see a film so baldy I have to wait for a while until I finally get a chance to watch it, story of my life really. But anywhere I was really looking forward to this movie ever since September, and now finally seeing the film I can safely say that Birdman is one of the best movie of 2014.\n\nI always know that Micheal Keaton was the kind of movie star that will pick any random movie role just because... well he what's to be important and still show to everyone that he still got it, I guess?. Like early last year now he was in two movies that were pretty blah, and that was The Robocop remake and the film Need for Speed, and those films just made Keaton look like he was just cashing it in just for the sake of it. Until when I watched this movie and seeing Micheal Keaton's performance and thinking to myself \"Wait is Keaton giving probably his best performance I've ever seen in my life? I think he is\", because Keaton in this movie pretty much pulls of the best performance I've seen him in his all career. His character in this movie is like a wash up actor who had everything like love from the critics, his fans Yeah he still dose have that Keaton thing that he always dose in his previous movies, but the scenes where he plays his character (Which is himself if you really look at his character in this movie) but anywhere he still gives a strong and believable performance that at times give me flashbacks of the good old days where he still had roots and felt like he isn't just cashing it in. I hear a lot of Oscar buzz about his performance in this movie, and I wouldn't be surprise if he wins because he totally deserves it. Excellent work Keaton.\n\nEdward Norton is this movie pretty much plays a familiar character to himself has the hard to work with actor that at times doesn't follow the lines that he was given or even the direction he was told. We already know that Norton is a fantastic actor in his previous work, but in this movie his performance could be descried has stellar and insanely good.\n\nEmma Stone is this movie and of course like most of the actors I named of so far of who outstanding they were in this movie and well you can already guess what I'm going to say next. Emma Stone acting in this movie was just terrific and marvellous to watch in this movie and it's good to see a real break out performance from her more than the lay back ones in her other movies. Nice one Emma. The other cast in the movie like Naomi Watts, Zach Galifianakis both did good as well.\n\nThe movie is shot to look like it's all one shot take and my mind was just blown away by that fact. There where screens were I said to myself \"Oh my god is it one shot?\", well I can already imagine the stress, hard work and how many takes they had to do to get it, and boy did it pay off nicely, because I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I dared myself to look away from the beautiful cinematography and the impressive editing used in the film.\n\nThe movie has a brilliant message about film critics today that doesn't feel like it's in your face message that you normally get in movies. There is a scene in this movie and it's not a spoiler by the way, but I really need to get this out the way first. So anywhere Micheal Keaton character just starts having a rant over this theater critic who is going to give a bad review to his play when she hasn't even seen it or seen any of the premieres. He talks about how she only users big words that nobody will say in person and shes to lazy to come up what she really thinks about it so she users big words just to fill in the sentence. This movie probably has the best rant in movie history and Keaton in that scene shows how good of a actor that he is.\n\nFor problems in the movie... I really don't have any to be honest.\n\nI loved this movie and yes I'm coming out be saying that. This isn't just the best movie of the year and such, no this is just flawless film making right here. Birdman and Whiplash are the two films I will highly recommend to people because those two films are my favorite films of 2014.",

To figure that out would require a second watch, and that is not currently possible for me right now. Anyways, nearly everything about this movie is flawless. It's edited to look as if it was done in one shot and that freaking blew my mind. I honestly could not tell where the cuts were. It looked as if the camera never stopped rolling. That in itself is an achievement on its own, but Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu takes it another step. There is actually a point to filming this movie like this. The film is about Michael Keaton's character making a play, so it makes sense to make the movie look and feel like a play. Major props that for that call. The direction is incredible of course. This man managed to make a movie look like one shot. It that isn't freaking awesome, then I don't know what is. Everyone in this movie gives a magnificent performance. Everyone from Michael Keaton, to Emma Stone, to Zach Galifianakis of all people, give Oscar worthy performances. Even the special effects are really well done. There isn't many of them, but the ones that were present were handled with exceptional care and looked very realistic. On top of all that, the film has a script that is both funny and intelligent. It has a lot to say about the state of Hollywood, big blockbuster films, and critics. It's nice to see there was a point to this movie. Last thing is the drum score. Now granted I'm not entirely sure what the point of it was (I have a theory, but I don't feel like talking about it), but it sounded so cool that I had to mention it. Whoever played those drums kicks serious ass. I've named all the positives and I actually have no issues with this film. I cannot recommend this movie more. See it in the theater if you can.",

A strong ensemble cast adds to Birdman's strength including Ed Norton pretty much playing his own off screen persona and Emma Stone playing Riggin's recovering addict daughter.  Perhaps the most underappreciated performance of the film goes to the wily lawyer Zach Galifinakis bringing forth a performance unexpected from the Hangover star showcasing a different type of humor.  Loaded with dark comedy, amazing dialogue, and innovative direction, Birdman soars with personal interpretation as the third act could be interpreted as either a happy or sad ending depending on one's personal understanding.  Personally, I believe it is a happy ending, but I won't give anything more away.  Fingers crossed for Keaton at the Oscars.

Hollywood has dramatically changed since then, and Keaton has found himself in a totally different position, replaced by new superstars to take up the superhero and blockbuster roles.  Those days of fame and flowing paychecks have waned for not only the actor but the man who he intimately portrays in this black comedy, Riggan Thomson.  Twenty years since starring in the Birdman franchise (ha, get it?), he has diminished into obscurity-hardly drawing in crowds for barely-constructed Broadway productions.  That inherent feeling of self-importance is killing Riggan, the artist, inside with how far he has faded from the public eye. \n\n If there's one thing Birdman's narrative is particularly exceptional at, it's the honest and cynical look at the sheer egoism and narcissism that make up artists/actors.  You always need to feel like you're the highlight of the show-the one that gets the headlines and fan girls.  But when the startling truth of your irrelevance becomes realized, an ego hurt is like a soul penetrated with a keen knife.  Riggan is struggling to finally make that comeback and eventually leave the world with a true legacy.  He desperately wants people to admire him and to remember him as the legend his alter ego-the deep-voiced, snarky Birdman himself-and he think he is.  There's no question that this is one of those films that rely more on its performances than its plot/narrative.  \n\nConsequently, this is where mixed feelings materialize, but Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's latest ambitious picture still boasts an incredible ensemble nonetheless that ranges from the greats like Naomi Watts and Edward Norton to newcomers who're still on the path to prove themselves like Zach Galifianakis and Emma Stone.  Norton seemingly plays a role that also mocks his career and well-known personality.  Whereas Keaton is yearning for admiration and respect here, Norton doesn't give two hoots about audience reception as he focuses more on his utter artistry and method acting ability, despite letting his bossiness and arrogance dominate the backstage production.  Stone plays Riggin's daughter, Sam, who's a recovering drug addict but also frankly exasperated by her father's self-centered tendencies, constantly hanging around the theater with snide remarks.  \n\nContinue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/2014/11/02/birdman-review-uh-oh-critic-says-birdman-is-not-perfect/",

Birdman isn't just hilarious, it also gives actors Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, and Emma Stone the greatest performances of their whole careers.\n\nMichael Keaton (Beetlejuice, Batman) makes an epic comeback performance as he stars as Riggan Thomson, a washed-up actor who used to play a iconic superhero named Birdman, that is now working on a broadway play of an old story called \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" with the help of his friend Jake, (the funny Zach Galifinakis, The Hangover, Puss In Boots), Riggan is working on this play with a few other broadway actors, Lesley (the beautiful Naomi Watts, King Kong, The Impossible) and Mike Shiner ( the talented Edward Norton, Fight Club, The Incredible Hulk). He also has his daughter Sam, (the brilliant Emma Stone, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Croods) helping with his career. As Riggan works on the play, his voice of his superhero character is inside his head saying his career is ruined and states that he should make a huge comeback. Now Riggan has to battle his own ego to get his family, career, and himself back to the way it all used to be. \n\nEverything in this movie will blow you away! The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, who won an oscar for his work in Gravity, makes the camera moving so much better in Birdman. The movie is like a broadway play, it's non-stop. The camera makes it like one long movie take. Alejandro G. Inarritu writes this wonderful script with co-writers Nicol\u00c3\u00c2\u00a1s Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Jr., Armando Bo. All four writers have created a memorable script that will be loved by everyone. \n\nThe cast is also marvelous. Keaton is perfection, Norton is awesome, Stone is great, Galifinakis is funny, and Watts is amazing. Other co-stars such as Amy Ryan as Riggan's ex-wife, and Andrea Roughbourgh as one of Riggan's co-stars in the play are also brilliant. \n\nBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance) is a movie you shall never forget! Michael Keaton delivers the greatest performance of his whole career and should get an Oscar nomination for this performance! Edward Norton is perfect as Mike! Emma Stone gives a performance that is worth watching! This movie has a great cast, great cinematography, great screenplay, great acting, great directing, which makes this a great movie! Birdman is a must-see!",

However, every once in a while, there is a film that is more of an \"experience\" than just a film. Its surreal nature prohibits you from taking your eyes off of the screen because the visuals are so astounding and the story is so intriguing. The film Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) has that quality and has become my second favorite film (after Pulp Fiction). In my life, I have never seen a film done so masterfully and with such interesting characters.\n In addition to the characters, the breathtaking cinematography and editing style were seamless. It was difficult to tell how they accomplished certain effects. Even though physically impossible, the film seemed to be filmed in one single shot. There are moments you know they had cut to the next shot, but it is cheated so well that if you weren't paying attention to that aspect of the film, you wouldn't even notice. In the story, there were subtleties that hinted at inside jokes. There is a dig at big budget blockbuster action films, alluding that they are superficial and take attention away from smaller, more ambitious independent films. Also, the obvious parallel that Michael Keaton who played Batman, Edward Norton who played The Incredible Hulk, and Emma Stone who played Spider-Man's girlfriend played their roles in a way that could mirror their own personalities. It is an interesting coincidence that the timeline of the main character's film career matched perfectly with the career of Michael Keaton's Batman films and Edward Norton has a reputation of doing things that his character did while on the sets of certain films. There was so much effort and detail put into each moment of this film so I am surprised it is only in limited release at the moment. Birdman is a modern masterpiece and will be hailed as a classic in the future. If you want a truly unique and amazing film experience, go and see this immediately.",

It was a real drama, co-written, produced, and directed the best possible way by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. Impressive cast includes Michael Keaton with Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts.\n\nThe story of a faded Hollywood actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) famous for playing the superhero Birdman in blockbuster movies decades earlier, who is struggling to mount a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver story, was developed very smoothly. Riggan keep hearing the voice of Birdman, who criticizes him and torments him. Riggan imagines that has capabilities of performing feats of levitation and telekinesis.\n\nBirdman received critical acclaim and I agree with every positive review ever for this movie. It was named one of the best films of 2014 by organizations including the AFI and the National Board of Review. It was nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards at the 72nd ceremony, including Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Director, Best Score and won for Best Screenplay. Keaton won Best Actor, while Norton and Stone were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively at both the Golden Globe Awards and the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, where the cast is also nominated for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture. Of course I saw it as soon as possible... and here in China is not in cinemas, yet!\n\nImpressive layered story, outstanding acting, enchanting photography, excellent directing... not easy to find all those things into a single movie... but here you can easily recognise them all!",

            "content": "Birdman, just as Boyhood (2014), is one of those movies where the audience - depending on their circumstance - simply might not understand why either is lauded as being great, and while it is acceptable, said reason is not one that detracts from the overall filmmaking process that went into both movies, particularly Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's Birdman. As Birdman says, \"Look at these people. Look at their eyes; they're all sparkling. They love this shit. They love blood. They love action. Not this talking, depressing, philosophical bullshit.\" And Birdman is nothing but a stream of steaming philosophical bullshit made for those that enjoy nothing but to pick at a layered art piece such as this like they would do with a scab.\n\nAn exploration of the connection between artists and their ego, Birdman serves as a battleground of themes and ideas from Riggan Thomson's midlife crisis as an actor, whilst striking many facets of performance arts such as the correlation and dichotomy between critics and actors, theatre and cinema, along with the old world attempting to find relevance in a new world. Relevance, in itself, is one of the key underlying and constantly recurring themes throughout I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's Birdman that is exemplified from the verbal to physical sparring between the characters with existential undertones. Transcending the plane of existence within its weighty script, Riggan and those around him are shown to be struggling to remain relevant in a changing world that has moved past disenfranchised Broadway performances and into billion dollar movie franchises\n\nAs a washed out actor who was also the first to don the cape and cowl of Batman in a live-action movie, Keaton's role in Birdman is one of a meta-nature - just as the very meta-premise -, as he plays the near-identical role of Riggan to his strengths and finally finds relevance after a slate of roles which had side-lined the actor's inherent, immense talent. And it doesn't just stop at just Keaton; Norton shines in his portrayal as a hyper-exaggerated version of himself as Mike Shiner, an actor that is too method for his own good and a general pain in the ass for everyone that works with him, as Watts herself finally puts up a decent performance as small as her role is as Riggan's co-star, Lesley. On the younger spectrum of Birdman's talent is the big-eyed Emma Stone, who too, plays a slightly meta-version of herself to adequate perfection as Riggan's daughter, Sam.\n\nWhile Antonio S\u00e1nchez' eclectic use of drums in Birdman's score has shown to be just as divisive as the movie's central narrative - some have gone so far as to calling the near-constant stream of drumming as pompous -, what can't be denied anything but tangible recognition is the surreal direction that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu takes with his actors and the script, which were further elevated through yet another career high display of aptitude by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki.\n\nKnown for his notorious skill involving long takes - such as what was seen in Children of Men (2006) -, Lubezki's cinematographical prowess is taken to the absolute extreme, as the latter, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and the director's go-to editors - Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione - turn Birdman into a beautifully shot and edited movie that comes under the guise as one long continuous take from the baffling opening shot of Riggan floating in mid-air to the equally, yet intentionally baffling ending. Birdman's illusion as one continuous long take from start to finish is less of a gimmick, and more of an extension of the movie's many strengths that effectively pushes the envelope with filmmaking.",

Joining him are Zack Galifianakis, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and Edward Norton who play his agent, fellow cast members, and daughter. My initial thoughts when starting it weren't too great, but I gradually came to appreciate it a little more for its technical achievement and some interesting observations on the lives of actors. Still, in a film about the ego of actors and the importance of artistic expression (among other things), it came off as egotistical and self-important. Without giving away specifics or plot spoilers, I can say that the film is very \"meta.\" Michael Keaton is playing a character who has some similarities, or shares some DNA, with his real-life persona, as does Edward Norton (apparently). Michael Keaton's Riggan Thompson is a former blockbuster movie star who is trying to do something artistic for personal validation, and Edward Norton's Mike Shiner is a method actor who probably takes his job a little too seriously. For me, those two characters (and their interactions) form the central dialogue and message the film is trying to get across. They also had the most interesting dynamic in the story. What I didn't necessarily warm up to was the rather cynical attitude it had towards critics and big-budget filmmaking. And some of the magical realism came off as labored attempts to be clever. Elements that did work a little more include Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, giving the film a Malickian feel, and the drum score. Overall, I would say that I appreciated the film for what it is more than actually liking or enjoying it. It has an impeccable technical construction, but a lot of the dialogue and overt messaging felt more like therapy for actors and didn't engage me like a straightforward drama normally would. Even though this is Inarrittu's most playful film yet, it made me long for the emotional manipulation of something like 21 GRAMS. There is a time and place for different kinds of movies, and the way the film takes sides when they both feed into each other was rather disingenuous. I can understand why this film did so well at the Oscars, because Hollywood always likes patting themselves on the back, but it has mixed results as entertainment.",

The movie is extremely meta! It borrows its editing style from Hitchcock's Rope. The subtitle\"The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance\" is the review by the critic who hates Riggan (Keaton). Michael Keaton's previous role as Batman lends an interesting layer to his portraying this character. Art imitates art with all the discussion of the short story adaptation of \"What We Talk about When We Talk about Love.\" The cinematography and way the actors must be in the moment for longer scenes as if they are really performing in theatre is mindbendingly awesome.

Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is a director best known for grim, joyless and depressing human dramas (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Biutiful and the incredibly pretentious Babel), so the idea of him directing a surrealistic black comedy about a washed-up actor, best known for playing a superhero a few decades ago, orchestrating a Broadway play to regain his former glory sounded very refreshing. The film also stars Michael Keaton in his first lead role in years, but the most unexpected thing about it is that it's edited to look like a single long take. The end result is nearly worth all the hype. Though the initial premise could result to a clich\u00e9d bore, Birdman is a multi-layered, darkly funny and sometimes completely fantastical film that also has satirical ambitions towards themes like celebrity culture, egotism, social media and even superhero movies. Keaton's character, Riggan Thomson, is a very typical Hollywood has-been: no one remembers him for playing anything else than the film's title hero, he desperately wants to prove to be capable of doing something more, and constantly fights with his ego. The role of Birdman even haunts him inside his head, tempting him to take the easy way and just sell out. Most of the film is kind of seen through Riggan's warped perspective; every character from Edward Norton's arrogant but popular method actor to Emma Stone's formerly drug-addicted daughter to Lindsay Duncan's snarky theatre critic is more of a nightmarish product of Riggan's imagination than a real-life figure. Keaton delivers an electrifying performance, and his comeback is the most unforgettable since that of Mickey Rourke's in The Wrestler; Norton is clearly having fun in his outrageous role and does it brilliantly; Stone has never been more intense, and Zach Galifianakis (in a surprising dramatic role), Naomi Watts, Andrea Riseborough and Duncan are no less than fantastic. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography, seamlessly edited by Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrone, is surely going to win him his second consecutive Oscar (previously for Gravity), and Antonio S\u00e1nchez's drumming on the background creates an effectively offbeat experience. But Birdman has a similar problem with Biutiful; there are too many underdeveloped elements (like the various romantic relationships and Norton's character) which the film forgets during its third act, when it starts focusing on Riggan alone. It may take a second viewing to fully digest everything contained within it, but for now Birdman is a thoroughly entertaining romp and possibly I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's finest work to date.",

It's terrifically acted, very confident, very well acted, pretty funny, pretty interesting, and a little messy. Michael Keaton does, however, live up to his own hype for his performance and it's refreshing to see Emma Stone utilize her more sarcastic and realistic persona here; she's really great. I appreciate and enjoy Edward Norton's self-deprecating attitude as his obnoxious character fits in with the film's meta humor. I do feel like they could have done more with their meta tone since there seem to be a few missed opportunities regarding possible jabs at show business. The movie itself is kind of messy, but never distractingly so. Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez I\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a1rritu's direction maintains a lightness about it, and it kind of reminds me of Wes Anderson lite or something specifically in terms of awkward and physical humor. I wouldn't call this one of the best of the year, but it's still really solid regardless. 8.3/10, one thumb up, really good, definitely above average, etc.",

It really portrays in a clear and concise way, how actors are always falling in and out of the spotlight.\nMichael Keaton is borderline miraculous! Loved the rest of the cast too! Clearly Edward Norton hasn't been this good in a movie in a long time. Naomi Watts is also super effective in a smaller role. And Emma Stone - hilarious! The whole cast is pretty damn talented!\nWhat makes this movie so bloody great is the directing and the continuous shot approach. Really good stuff, but clearly not for everyone. Despite some occasional lapses in the writing and some periodic pacing issues in the first half-hour, the film delivers on all other fronts, especially its biting humor, intriguing visuals and stellar performances. The camera work is impressive. It is a must-see. From it's black comedy, to it's choppy drum score, this movie really impressed me.\nIt's so weird and I adored it!
