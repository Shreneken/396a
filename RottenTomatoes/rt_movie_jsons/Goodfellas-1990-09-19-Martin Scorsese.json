The significance in the plot and characters are outstanding. I enjoyed all of their humor and found some parts extremely amusing. The cast was casted perfectly I could't have imagined anybody else playing their roles. Although it might seem like another Italian mob movie I can ensure you it is not. While watching, I uncovered the hidden meanings behind some parts and was remarkably intrigued. To conclude, you should definitely watch this movie !",

            "content": "A crowning achievement in cinematic history, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is a sweeping, masterful epic that transcends the crime genre, delving into the depths of family, power, and loyalty. Adapted from Mario Puzo's bestselling novel, this 1972 masterpiece weaves an intricate tapestry of unforgettable characters, rich storytelling, and a haunting sense of inevitability.\n\nThe Godfather follows the powerful Corleone crime family, headed by the patriarch Vito Corleone, played by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Brando's nuanced, magnetic performance sets the stage for a tale of betrayal, revenge, and the inexorable pull of the underworld. As the narrative unfolds, we witness the transformation of the reluctant Michael Corleone, portrayed with chilling precision by a young Al Pacino, who rises to the occasion, embracing his dark destiny.\n\nThe ensemble cast is nothing short of extraordinary, with standout performances from James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, who breathe life into their characters, making them feel like fully realized, complex individuals. The Godfather's richly textured world is further enhanced by Nino Rota's unforgettable score and Gordon Willis' striking cinematography, which paints a brooding, atmospheric portrait of the Corleone family's rise and fall.\n\nCoppola's visionary direction and Puzo's masterful screenplay elevate The Godfather to a level of storytelling that resonates with viewers on both an intellectual and emotional level. The film deftly explores themes of power, corruption, and morality, posing questions that linger long after the final frame.\n\nA true masterpiece that has stood the test of time, The Godfather is a testament to the power of cinema, an operatic tapestry of family, loyalty, and betrayal that remains as compelling and relevant today as it was upon its release. This timeless classic is an essential viewing experience for anyone who appreciates the art of filmmaking.",

It is considered one of the greatest movies ever made in the genre of gangster films.\n\nThe film tells the story of Henry Hill, a young man who grows up in the New York City mafia and becomes a member of the infamous Lucchese crime family. The movie portrays the rise and fall of Hill's criminal career, his relationships with his fellow gangsters, and his efforts to balance his life of crime with his family and personal life.\n\nThe performances in Goodfellas are excellent, particularly from De Niro and Pesci, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the volatile and unpredictable Tommy DeVito. The screenplay, adapted from Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy, is sharp and engaging, with memorable dialogue and a gripping narrative.\n\nScorsese's direction is masterful, with the film's use of voiceover narration, music and editing creating a distinctive and immersive atmosphere. The movie's famous long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub is an iconic moment in cinema history.\n\nOverall, Goodfellas is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to be celebrated and admired by audiences and critics alike. It is a must-see for anyone interested in the gangster genre, or for anyone who appreciates great filmmaking.",

            "content": "Arguably the greatest film made about life in organized crime and one of director Martin Scorsese's masterpieces. The film's genius is the balance it gives its subject. Scorsese puts across the glitz and glittery appeal of this lifestyle, rife with luxury and working-class glamour. But he never shies away from the cost of this way of life - violence (often merciless and brutal), paranoia, desperation, and even isolation. Scorsese makes the violence palatable by peppering scenes with dark wit. There's revealing voice-over narration, giving the affair a level of charismatic cynicism few crime movies offer. The cast is wonderful, with Ray Liotta making his character's arc from green errand-running wannabe, to full-fledged mafioso, then outcast black sheep believable. Robert De Niro brings just the right blend of native cunning, menace and paranoia. Joe Pesci is the movie's spark of life, a diminutive gangster with a chip on his shoulder and a hair-trigger temper. His build-up to becoming a made man deliver's one of cinema's great payoffs. Paul Sorvino IS organized crime. Lorraine Bracco adds guilt and sexual heat, as well as additional narration insight into her character, giving voice to the women caught up in this gangland drama. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker makes this two-and-a-half hour film move and keep us engrossed from its violent opening to the cocaine-fueled frenzied paranoia of the finale. Michael Ballhaus' artful compositions and gliding camerawork (including the famous single-take entry into The Copacabana) bring this world to life,  It's all great drama, a definitive portrait of American crime, and probably my favorite movie ever",

Its allure is immediate and somehow manages to evoke the riveting dramatic rapture of one long, miraculously sustained climax. It is as powerful a film as any produced within the gangster genre and is, in the opinion of this reviewer, unlikely to ever be topped. Many films rely on the art of subtlety and nuance in the synthesis of their vision; \"Goodfellas\" takes the stunning opposite approach of pulling out all of the stylistic stops and brazenly flaunting its material in all of its decadent glory. A lilting, period-specific soundtrack runs continuously, enhancing our feel for the time and place as Henry Hill's unrestrained narration pulls us into the center of the lifestyle as assuredly as a fish caught on a hook. Perhaps the film's greatest achievement is to so convince us of our status as participants in the story as to render us nearly as nostalgic for this complex and morally abhorrent way of life as the Hill character who serves as our attentive guide. Like \"The Godfather,\" \"Goodfellas\" offers us an immersive view into a gangster world which also has the feel of an intimate family portrait, achieving a vision of the lifestyle through a passionate stylistic construction that is virtually flawless from one intense moment to the next.",

            "content": "In 1955, youngster Henry Hill becomes enamored by the criminal life and Mafia presence in his working class Italian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn. He begins working for local caporegime Paulie Cicero and his associates: Jimmy \"the Gent\" Conway (Robert De Niro), an Irish-American truck hijacker and gangster, and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci), a fellow juvenile delinquent. Henry begins as a fence for Jimmy, gradually working his way up to more serious crimes. The three associates spend most of their nights in the 1960s at the Copacabana nightclub carousing with women. Henry (Ray Liotta) starts dating Karen Friedman, a Jewish woman who is initially troubled by Henry's criminal activities. Seduced by Henry's glamorous lifestyle, she marries him despite her parents' disapproval. In 1970, Billy Batts, a made man in the Gambino crime family who was recently released from prison, repeatedly insults Tommy at a nightclub owned by Henry; Tommy and Jimmy beat, stab and fatally shoot Billy. The unsanctioned murder of a made man invites retribution; realizing this, Jimmy, Henry, and Tommy bury the body in upstate New York. Six months later, however, Jimmy learns that the burial site is slated for development, prompting them to exhume and relocate the decomposing corpse. In 1974, Karen harasses Henry's mistress, Janice, and threatens Henry at gunpoint. Henry moves in with Janice, but Paulie insists that he should return to Karen after collecting a debt from a gambler in Tampa with Jimmy. Upon returning, Jimmy and Henry are arrested after being turned in by the gambler's sister, an FBI typist, and they receive ten-year prison sentences. To support his family on the outside, Henry has Karen smuggle in drugs and sells them to a fellow inmate from Pittsburgh. Four years later, Henry is paroled and expands his cocaine business with Jimmy and Tommy against Paulie's orders. Jimmy organizes a crew to raid the Lufthansa vault at John F. Kennedy International Airport, stealing six million dollars in cash and jewelry. After some members purchase expensive items against Jimmy's orders and the getaway truck is found by police, he has most of the crew except Tommy and Henry murdered...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics consensus reads, \"Hard-hitting and stylish, GoodFellas is a gangster classic\u2014and arguably the high point of Martin Scorsese's career.\" In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars and wrote, \"No finer film has ever been made about organized crime \u2013 not even The Godfather.\" In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Gene Siskel wrote, \"All of the performances are first-rate; Pesci stands out, though, with his seemingly unscripted manner. GoodFellas is easily one of the year's best films.\" Both named it as the best film of 1990. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, \"More than any earlier Scorsese film, Goodfellas is memorable for the ensemble nature of the performances... The movie has been beautifully cast from the leading roles to the bits. There is flash also in some of Mr. Scorsese's directorial choices, including freeze frames, fast cutting and the occasional long tracking shot. None of it is superfluous.\" USA Today gave the film four out of four stars and called it, \"great cinema\u2014and also a whopping good time.\" David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote \"Every crisp minute of this long, teeming movie vibrates with outlaw energy.\" Rex Reed said, \"Big, rich, powerful and explosive. One of Scorsese's best films! Goodfellas is great entertainment.\" In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, \"So it is Scorsese's triumph that GoodFellas offers the fastest, sharpest 2\u00bd-hr. ride in recent film history.\" (via Wikipedia)\n\nMartin Scorsese\u00b4s biographical gangster flick (an adaptation of the 1985 nonfiction book \"Wiseguy\" by Nicholas Pileggi) about the real Henry Hill has a great cast with Ray Liotta, Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci in the leads. All of them bring their A-game to this organized crime flick. Scorsese directs with style and vibrating energy which runs through the film. However, I personally think that film is too long as the storyline drags a bit and the conclusion could\u00b4ve come earlier. \"Goodfellas\" is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, particularly in the gangster genre, but I need to be honest with the fact that the gangster genre has never been my genre, with a few exceptions, so I guess I am not the best to judge that genre. But, with that said I was still entertained. Rest in peace Mr. Liotta. \n\nTrivia: The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, with Pesci winning for Best Supporting Actor. The film won five awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, including Best Film and Best Director. Additionally, \"Goodfellas\" was named the year's best film by various critics' groups. In 2000, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress.",

            "content": "There are very few mob movies that are truly great.  \"The Godfather\" and its' sequel are two such examples.  There have been many other attempts since then, but none have come close to the greatness of those two movies.  Martin Scorsese's \"Goodfellas\" does fit perfectly into that category in my opinion.  The movie for all intents and purposes hits all the right notes and hits them perfectly.  One of the complaints I hear about Mob movies and television series in general is that they glorify life in the Mafia and make it seem like a good thing that we should all aspire to.  \"Goodfellas\" does not do that at all.  After seeing this movie any ideas you had that life in organized crime is a good thing will disappear instantly.  The character of Henry Hill (Played to perfection by the late Ray Liotta.) is the focal point of the movie.  The audience follows his life in the Mafia from his humble beginnings to ultimately having to cooperate with federal authorities to save his life as well as those of his family.  Veteran actor Paul Sorvino gives an unforgettable performance as Mob Boss Paulie Cicero.  While Paulie can come across as mild mannered and easy going in nature, his mere presence is enough to cause fear in even the most hardened person.  Very similar to Robert DeNiro's Academy Award winning performance as Vito Corleone in \"The Godfather, Part 2\".  Speaking of DeNiro, his performance as mafioso Jimmy \"The Gent\" Conway is the stuff of legend.  Nobody could have played the role anywhere near as well as he did.  Joe Pesci is equally as excellent in his Academy Award winning role as loose cannon Tommy DeVito.  he steals almost every scene he is in.  As great as the cast is, what truly makes \"Goodfellas\" a great movie is the relationship between the characters.  How their lives are closely intertwined and how they conduct business. It all comes across as very genuine.  More than thirty years after its initial release, \"Goodfellas\" has stood the test of time and is classic in every sense of the word.",

It stars an excellent trio in Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and the main lead by Ray Liotta. The film follows a young man Henry played by Liotta who from an early age living in New York gets involved with gangsters who eventually mentor him and he becomes a gangster himself. The movie is masterfully directed and the performances by the trio are excellent. Liotta plays a character who's trying to figure out who he is in this world  and what he needs to do to get what he wants and over time becomes corrupted by the life he chose. Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway is vicious and serves as a father figure to Henry. Obvously the highlight is to see Joe Pesci as in every gangster movie he is viciously killing people with his signature high pitch voice. The movie drags in my opinion setting the foundation of who Henry is taking too long to where the movie needs to be. Yet is a masterpiece, beautifully directed and scripted  with close ups done beautifully by Scorcese and another gangster movie that accurately portrays that life.",

It's engaging and satisfying to watch the world Henry once stood on top of close in around him and how that affects his emotions and relationships with those around him. This film also does a good job of portraying the casual bigotry of both the time periods and social circles we're introduced to without minimizing or making a joke out of it.\n\nThe cast really makes this movie great. The 4 characters we see the most often are also the ones played with the most impressive of performances. I particularly appreciated Joe Pesci's ability to make his character nefarious, motivated, annoying, stupid, and relatable, all at the same time. The script helps these performances a lot, especially in how its dialogue often feels realistic in emotional moments rather than forced like it does in many other movies. The characters are lost for words, repeat themselves, stumble over themselves, and just scream out of frustration in a way that feels a lot like what real people actually do.\n\nThe only real flaws here are technical ones. The editing occasionally feels a little sloppy and the narration gimmick kinda gets forgotten about for a while. The characters also never really look the age they're supposed to, except Robert De Niro's Jimmy for some reason. But the most egregious is Ray Liotta's Henry, who is portrayed by the same actor from 21 to 50 or so and yet who somehow never looks like the correct age.\n\nDespite some technical shortcomings, Goodfellas is an engaging classic that does well with its epic gangster premise to draw emotions out of both its characters and audience.",

The dark humour put forward by them is just hilarious, especially Joe Pesci who's just being himself on set and having an absolute blast. I truly can't applaud the writers and leads enough for the grin they put on my face. If I have to give some critique, it's that the rest of the movie feels worse when you compare it to those flarkin' amazing scenes, which isn't really fair to do since the rest is still solid but it hampers the experience a tad bit. Another slight issue is that some of the side characters felt completely arbitrary. Not only that, their performances are incredibly subpar. It felt as if they needed a couple extra actors and they just grabbed random pedestrians off the street.

Recognizing that this was excellent did more to paint my opinion of his 2013 movie than it did this one as it illuminates Wolf of Wall Street as a safe re-tread of a formula that had worked for Scorsese in the past here. There's certainly room in the world for two ultra-narrated crime epics though, and I'm glad to have now seen both of them.",

            "content": "Goodfellas is a gangster masterpiece from Martin Scorsese!\n\nDirector Martin Scorsese's crime drama Goodfellas (1990) perfectly captures the origins and establishing era to the downfall of gangster Henry Hill. Scorsese's direction is so smooth, creative, and entertaining that Goodfellas' epic crime story length of 145 minutes feels like a half hour. Scorsese's regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker makes all these hard cuts to the music cues for Scorsese's killer soundtrack alongside all the sudden violence. Scorsese clearly knows Hill's entire story front to back and commands scenes with a knowledgeable ease. As crazy and unbelievable as every scene is, Goodfellas is completely realistic and authentic. It's like you're really watching a criminal mastermind unfold before your very eyes from small jobs to money drops and massive drug dealing. Goodfellas has it all!\n\nMartin Scorsese's writing is so natural and pithy with these seemingly normal conversations actually referring to killing people, dealing drugs, plotting heists, or making peace with the Italian mob. Scorsese adapts Nicholas Pileggi's novel with a deft conciseness that never falters or feels disingenuous. I laughed at all the wild jokes, gasped at the sudden gunshots, and was horrified by the casual racism and brutal sexism. But it all feels realistic for the mafia of this era in the 1970's and 1980's from the mob killings and disposing of dead bodies to eating pasta with a friend's mother. Goodfellas never shies away from the violence and brutality, but Scorsese pulls it off with a flourish that's highly entertaining to watch. These are all terrible men, but Scorsese's wise guys really think they're good fellas at heart, despite all their murder, thievery, lies, cover-ups, betrayals, and hatred.\n\nRay Liotta is incredibly realistic as the eager young mobster Henry Hill. His overindulgence in the world of crime and deception feels authentic as he laughs too hard at the elder gangsters' jokes and goes along with all manner of heinous crimes at his leisure. Liotta plays both the everyman thrust into a vicious, paranoia and cruel cheating world of casual murder and intense fighting. He's got real chemistry with the gorgeous Lorraine Bracco, who plays Hill's mob wife Karen Hill. She effortlessly portrays Karen initially as the sweet girl next door to a feisty girlfriend screaming at him, then the crazy mob wife who will hide bloody guns and dispose of cocaine for evidence. Bracco is the heart of the story as Hill treats her terribly and she sticks by this awful, violent man anyways as she gets caught up in the glamour of wealth and being toxically devoted to Henry Hill despite his infidelity. In fact, she wants to be the winner compared to Hill's mistresses and actually get the guy at the end of the day.\n\nI love when Bracco's Karen wakes Liotta's Henry up with the gun in his face. That shot from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus is incredible like all the wide shots of the gangsters drinking at restaurants or the close-ups that just hold on characters until you realize they're about to kill someone. Robert De Niro is very subtle as the Irish mobster Jimmy Conway with his deadly whacks and clever heist jobs. You can always tell what De Niro is thinking with his deep stares and long held frowns. \n\nI have to mention the mighty Joe Pesci, who steals the show as the fiery Tommy DeVito with his short temper and quick wit. You believe that Tommy could kill someone at a moment's notice due to Pesci's fearsome rage hidden behind his deadpan face and constant jests. When Frank Vicent's obnoxious Billy Batts is taunting and insulting Tommy, you can see on Joe Pesci's face that Tommy will kill the guy for sure just because he hurt his ego. In the mob, an insult could mean your last day.\n\nPaul Sorvino is excellent as the quiet, careful, and contemplative godfather character Paulie Cicero. It's like he knew he just has to have a serious gravitas and overwhelming presence. Every word is carefully chosen and delivered slowly with weight from Sorvino. Gina Mastrogiacomo is fun as Henry's side girl Janice Rossi, but not comparable to the thrilling and endearing Lorraine Bracco. Catherine Scorsese is hilarious and sweet as Joe Pesci's character Tommy's mother. It's fun seeing Martin Scorsese's real mom playing an Italian mob figure. Martin Scorsese's dad Charles Scorsese also cameos as Vinnie who cooks the sauce in jail. I loved seeing the lovely Debi Mazar play Henry's last mistress Sandy with her coke fueled mania and desperate neediness that shows just what a scumbag Henry Hill really was at heart.\n\nRichard Bruno's costumes are a haze of 70's and 80's gangster suits and women's loud dresses. Kristi Zea' production design makes all the sets look like those eras with creative signs, houses, alongside Leslie Bloom and Bruce Swanson's set decorations. Maher Ahmad's art direction is stunning with mobsters digging a grave at night against red light to a gun barrel in focus with the faces obscured. Lastly, Ilona Herman, Carl Fullerton, and Allen Weisinger's make-up looks like the raw and powdered era portrayed in Goodfellas with realistic bruises and wounds too.\n\nIn all, Martin Scorsese knocked it out of the park with Goodfellas. It's his Godfather with a natural warmth and casual humor and murder to every mob dealing.",

It tells a somewhat nuanced tale but always feels real, acting as a shockingly accurate portrayal of real-life events, and retains its humanity by having every character behave like a human, emotional and flawed, in terms of both writing and performances.  It shows many horrific events during its run, including betrayals of best-friends because the \"important\" people find them 'no longer necessary', yet it showcases an odd undertone of pitch-black humor.  Many movies have tried these, but to successfully balance these out WITHOUT ultimately just becoming a Black Comedy is one of the movie's magic tricks.  The performances from all of the main players are fantastic, the intellectual chess-moves between the gangsters and the police are engaging, and the Love-Hate relationship the audience has with virtually every player in the story is impressive.  Many feel that this film will one day just be forgotten as another that fell in the wake of The Godfather, but honestly, THIS is the Genre movie that should be shown in Film School, as it's more complex, more emotionally impactful, more focused and, if we're being honest, better executed.",

It is the film you immediately put on if found while scrolling through TV channels. It is the film you love even more during each viewing. It is the \"long\" film you never feel the runtime for. Goodfellas is perfect in every angle of what goes into making a movie. A screenplay written by a genius, while also adding genius improv from its star-studded cast. Pesci, Liotta, DeNiro, what's there more to say? Well-done pacing, great blocking, and chaotic yet easy-feeling editing, Goodfellas is easily one of the greatest mob movies ever made and if that makes you angry, I am sorry not sorry. Martin Scorsese doesn't just know how to make movies; he was born to make movies and his filmography is a treasure the cinema world can have forever. Also, it is worthy advice to never tell a mobster \"they are a funny guy!\" but! if you were to say this, it might get you a well-deserved Oscar.",

The gangster film helped revolutionized the crime genre by going down and dirty into the world of crime. Instead of focusing on the glitz and glamour fully, the movie really takes a dive into the life and times of a mobster, and how they interact and live their life. Its a film that felt like a deviation from other classics in the genre, and Scorcese's tricks are all on display through this movie. Its high on energy, kinetic in its acting, superbly edited, and just clicks from each and every single scene. Its a masterclass in what filmmaking is. What he did with this movie was create environments that felt super authentic. It helps that he actually brought in real mobsters to fill in the background during scenes, creating a surreal realism to the mob scene. Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Lorraine Bracco give powerhouse performances that make the film so easy to rewatch every single time. They live in those characters and really give off a vibe of being actually from this world. The editing is ferocious and so crazy that it feels super ahead of its time. The cinematography Michael Ballhaus really brings out the settings really well, with the hidden meanings as to what is going to happen to characters being shown with great flair and visual acuity. This movie is not just a gangster film, but rather, a testament to what could happen when you wish for a grand life and end up getting punished for that grand mentality. It shows that the world of crime might look nice at some points, but the consequences are endless to yourself and to the people around you. An excellent film that still enthrals people to this day!",

            "content": "Jeff Barnes \n2/22/21 \n\n\nGoodfellas Review\n\tGoodfellas is a story that is told in a very artistic, creative, and unique way. This is most notably with: script, music, acting, cinematography, and editing. The film plays like a documentary about the mob, that gives homage to The Godfather and previous work of renowned director Martin Scorsese. It contains colorful characters. \n\tGoodfellas tells the real-life story of Henry Hill and his relationship with the mafia and his wife Karen's experience with it. \n\tHenry Hill like Jake Lamotta in Raging Bull is a very flawed character because he's into crime and wants to be a gangster but he's very intriguing because we wonder why he wants to be a gangster and join the mob. Henry Hill thinks being a gangster is better than being president of the United States and this could be because gangsters have or seem to have more power than a president. Towards the beginning of the film, which is set in the 1950s, Hill, as a young boy, looks out his window and is very fascinated by what he sees. He realizes all of the freedom the wise guys have with being able to park wherever they want, being able to play cards as much as they want, and with being able to stay up as long as they want. No one ever calls the cops on them. The reason why people don't call the cops on them is perhaps because they are afraid, they'll get whacked if they do since it's what mobsters do especially when it comes to betrayal.  Goodfellas is told in a very fascinating manner. Director Martin Scorsese takes us through different time periods: the 1950s, the 1970s, and the 1980s. Scorsese brings excitement and attraction to the story of Goodfellas with having narration by Henry and his wife Karen. He has music in lots of the scenes in the film and he has different kinds of music for each time period and this is also unique and creative storytelling. Henry cheats on his wife Karen with at least two other women, one named Janice and the other named Sandy. Karen realizes that he's been cheating because he hasn't been home for two weeks and this makes her very disgusted with him. In Goodfellas we learn that the reason why thugs go out with one woman after the other even when they're married is because they believe that rules don't apply to them. Mobsters want no limitation. It seems like Henry's mob partner Tommy Devito goes out with at least four different women throughout the film.\n\tThe actors in the film give plenty of color to the characters they play particularly Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci. \n\tRay Liotta makes Henry Hill into a veritably tough man such as with the expression on his face after he hits a man named Bruce with a gun. But he also makes him a very frightened and concerned man such as when he sees his mob partners Jimmy Conway and Tommy Devito nearly beat a man named Billy Batts to death, and after Tommy whacks a man who insulted him named Spider. \n\tJoe Pesci gives a great quantity of depth to Tommy Devito. When a man who Tommy hasn't seen in years named Billy gives him a friendly greeting, such as with giving him a hug and holding his shoulder we can tell Tommy had a shacky relationship with him in the past because he looks annoyed and obnoxious as he greets him. Pesci makes Tommy look like he has tons of power over a man named Stacks Edwards as he's shooting him to death after he failed to get rid of a truck full of cash.\n\tThe narrative in Goodfellas is also told in an exclusive method because it's told well in a manner that most things aren't told well in with cinematography and editing most stories in film aren't told very well in this manner. There's a brilliant piece of filmmaking where the camera follows Henry and Karen as they make a shortcut into the nightclub Copacabana and there's no cuts as the camera follows them, and it's as if we're experiencing the Copacabana with them by going in with them. There's also a montage that shows still pictures of Henry, Karen and the family having a good time at home and with traveling which is reminiscent of a montage that's shown in Raging Bull. \n\tThere's also a scene that's worth mentioning where it shows Henry and Jimmy sitting by a window in a restaurant and Henry's narration says Jimmy wanted to talk to him by a window to make sure he didn't get tailed and the camera or editing shows a close up of what's going on outside as they talk. \n\tGoodfellas gives homage to The Godfather with mixing injustice with justice ,by being full of crime but, also full of religion. \n\tGoodfellas is told with lots of meaning and essence with its: script, music, acting, cinematography, and editing.",

The rise and fall of a mafia empire is hilarious and tense, owing largely to the supporting performances of an unhinged Joe Pesci, an acerbic Robert De Niro, and a committed Lorraine Bracco. The script feels natural and has an improvised, unpredictable energy, but never loses focus or feels too loose. It's a film that keeps you guessing, in suspense, and entertained from beginning to end. If I have one knock, I wasn't overly-impressed with Ray Liotta's starring performance. He was fine, but when surrounded by exceptional, fine fades. Even still, it's a remarkable movie that 31 years later is endlessly imitated and admired - and deservedly so.",

I never enjoyed movies about gangsters, but this one just won my heart. It is amazing in every single aspect -- every single phrase, every single shot, every single side character are amazing. The dialogue is very intense, funny at some points and interesting to observe as you never know how each of the dialogues will end and what consequences will such dialogue lead to. Joe Pesci is acting really good, you get the feeling of him being this one funny person in every company, which comes back home and becomes a total opposite of himself, but, in this movie, he doesn't come home, he expresses himself just like he is. This movie is relatable in every way, as each person watching can relate themselves to one character or another. Robert DeNiro has an outstanding performance and you get to feel him as a tough bad guy, who actually has a lot of feelings hidden underneath him. His character is being opened throughout the whole plot and his emotions are just so true and real. The main character played by Ray Liotta is fantastic because of how well he is portrayed. He has so many problems, yet still believes in the bright future even when the things go wrong. You expect all gangster movies to be some sort of a teaching of why you should not be a gangster and well, this movie does a direct opposite, which is why I love Scorsese. The aesthetic of the time and of the gangster world is given amazingly and realistically, which is why you believe every single shot that appears. The decisions with camera angles lead you to believing like if you yourself live Henry's life and the narrator, who is Henry himself, just gives you not only a better understanding of what is happening, but a feeling of a story being told. The movie is long, yet it is watched like if it is less than an hour long, because there was not a single scene that I have seen and found it boring. A true masterpiece and a movie that should be seen by anyone, even if you don't like the genre, there is plenty of everything somebody can find here: a lot of thoughtful moments, great humor, good action, awesome drama and at some points even thriller. A 10/10, Scorsese's GOLD and a MUST SEE!!!",

Its appeal and engagement is supremely accentuated by flashy supporting performances from Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro, as well as a classy script from Scorsese. But, (Unpopular opinion alert) what dilutes this film's sting is the strength of its lead performance. Ray Liotta is good. But he doesn't possess enough bravura, charisma or even charm to keep himself from falling into the pockets of his more commanding, established co-stars. You're left waiting for Deniro, Pesci, Paulie, Pete, Marie or even Morri to come in and inject some glorious mafioso goodness into the, at times, lukewarm solo scenes. On a different note, whoever said Scorsese can't write good female parts is W-R-O-N-G. She stole the show \u2014- and that really didn't help her on-screen husband.\nIt's still good, just unfortunate \u2014- somehow expectations always leave us feeling underwhelmed.\nIroh's grade: B-",

I know some will say \"The Godfather\" is the ultimate, but this one pulls you in from the first minute of the film and never lets you go.  It is that good.\n\nThe film focuses on the rise and fall of mob associate Henry Hill and his friends and family.  Ray Liotta plays Henry Hill and Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci play his best friends and crime associates.  We see their turbulent lives played out from 1955 to 1980 as they delve in robberies, drug trade and the occasional bloody and sometimes random murder.\n\nThe story is structured so well with Henry, and at times by his wife (played by Lorraine Bracco), narrating the events.  Usually main characters telling you how you should feel is annoying, but in this one the narration is a character in the movie.  You rarely see this in serious films, but Henry even addresses the movie audience at one point.  It's this type of movie making that makes people fall in love with motion pictures.\n\nIf you have never seen \"Goodfellas\" or have not seen it in a long time, I highly recommend it.  It's rare that you get a highly charged mix of drama, violence and, yes, even humor so well done.  Pop your popcorn before it starts because you won't want to pause to get it during the movie.",

            "content": "Goodfellas, directed & written by Martin Scorsese, produced by one of the best producers in the game today, in Irwin Winkler, is the most accurate, and my favorite mob movie of all time! Scorsese, Winkler & Pileggi crafted this beautifully told story, being nominated at the Academy Awards for Best Picture & Best Director. Marty displayed this incredible sense of direction, while pulling source material right out of Nicholas Pileggi's book, titled Wiseguys, based off of Henry Hill's life. Scorsese utilized great steady cam work, with intelligent usage of freeze frames, to capture important moments. He also used these great, eye-level seeking shots, displaying the amazing scenery and characters emotions.\n\nGoodfellas is a masterpiece whichever way you want to look at it. The story was a true, authentic representation of not only Henry Hill's life, but what life was like in the mafia, back in the 60s/early 70s. Some scenes probably came off as theatrical, or done for amusement (you think I'm a clown?), but according to Henry Hill himself, the content is 99.9% accurate, and ultimately dumbed down in a way. With the narration from Ray Liotta, it brought all of the content from the previous scenes together, making everything flow beautiful, with immaculate pacing.\n\nThe cast director in Ellen Lewis casted the absolute best, star studded cast possible! Each character had their own sense of comradeship. The attention to detail by all of the characters was nothing short of impeccable. The most notable performance of the film, was by one of my favorite actors, in Joe Pesci. He portrays Tommy De Simone's crazy, ludacris persona PERFECTLY, although he couldn't really embrace his physical structure, to say the least. Bob De Niro put on yet another stellar performance. His character was heavily focused on, to help build our main \"antihero\" in Ray Liotta. With a character with such a high stature, De Niro is the only casting that makes sense. Lorraine Bracco was the character the audience really felt for. She put on such a great, dramatic performance, selling every scene. Paul Sorvino always does a great job in these type of roles, but this time, I wish we got a little more of him. For someone who really meant a lot in the true story, he didn't have too much screen time, but when he did, he made a nobale and witty statement everytime. Even though I absolutely loved Sorvino's performance, he was probably my least favorite character, due to the justice that wasn't served to his high caliber character. The only minor take away from the characters as a whole; all of these characters (except Lorraine Bracco) are equally as violent, but they dumbed a few characters down.\n\nThe script by Martin Scorsese & Nicholas Pileggi (who also went on with Scorsese to do Casion), was BRILLIANT! With the popularity behind it, some of the dialogues were borrowed by other writers, who incorporated their tweaked version to their own work. The script carried so much weight, being so witty, and sliding in plenty of laughs.\n\nThe action was very stylish, gory, brutal, with a great 60s feel. The action was displayed almost to a T.\n\nOverall, this will forever go down as, not only one of the best mafia movies, but one of the best movies of all time.",

Amazing camera usage, acting, and story all combine to make this one of the best movies ever put together. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Robert de Niro are the main trio of actors and they all do fantastic. Pesci won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and it is easy to see why he did. He brings his natural energy to the role and makes it incredibly memorable. Liotta is the lead and his portrayal of real-life mobster, Henry Hill, is very good as well. This movie is a biopic of Hill and spans over decades telling the story of how he got involved with mafia and his ultimate fall from grace. It is entertaining, and intriguing. The dialogue, whether between the characters or the narration, is smart and important. Telling a story in two and a half hours about something that occurred over decades takes really precise writing to get the story across, and \"Goodfellas\" does this as perfect as a film can do it. Whereas \"The Godfather\" took a more romanticized view of organized crime, \"Goodfellas\" shows the real brutal and oftentimes ugly side of the mafia. The violence is brutal, but it is more often the aftermath of the violence that will leave an impression on the viewer's mind for years to come. The music that is put to this film is stylish and makes the atmosphere of the film even more intriguing. This is an essential film for any film buff. Overall, I give this film a 10/10.",

These supporting actors give powerful performances that make this movie riveting. What stands out from Goodfellas is that much of the film is just characters having conversations. Of course, there are unexpected bursts of Scorsese violence and all, but Goodfellas is an energetic film that never goes off track. The film's nearly 150 minutes long, but the thing is that it didn't feel like it. I'd say that for me, it felt 105 minutes. Once again, Goodfellas gives stunning performances, extraordinary editing, and an energetic story that never is tedious.

Robert De Niro is, for me anyway, the star of this however. Every single scene he brings his A-game, which I expected given how universally acclaimed that man is. Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino are also superb.\n\nThe whole film is put together excellently, I specifically enjoyed the paranoia stuff late on with Henry & Co. My only critique would be the part of the plot with the FBI typist, which kinda came out of nowhere. It is part of the storytelling though, so not even close to a major complaint of mine.\n\nThe pacing is tremendous too.

            "content": "Scorsese did it again with his 1990's Goodfellas.\n\nJust like all the other Martin Scorsese films, Goodfellas, starring Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, is a really fun movie to watch. De Niro, playing James Conway, played his role just the way we love to see it with his famous tricks and treits.\n\nThe book, Wiseguys, written by Nicholas Pileggi in 1985, is a story about an Irish Italian called Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who since young age dreamt of becoming a gangster. \"Being a gangster was better than being president of the United States\", so he says. After taking a job at the coffeeshop runned by a gangster called Paul Cicero (Paul Servino) across the street from where he lived, his dream starts getting fulfilled step by step.\n\nThe way Henry got to grow up in a gangster environment makes you want to grow up just like that yourself. Having people taking care of you and defending you like that is the dream of many youngers. Even Scorsese scripted girls to watch Henry with heart eyes while driving the gangsters Cadillacs. I mean, who wouldn't want that?\n\n In stead of going to school like a regular teenager, Henry was exploding cars, selling sigarettes on the corner of the street and whatever Paul would ask him to do. Ofcourse Paul always took really good care of Henry. Paul introduced Henry to James \"Jimmy\" Conway, a gangster who wasn't afraid of the law, he liked to steal a lot. After that, Henry got introduced to his new partner Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Henry, Tommy and Jimmy went on to do a lot of jobs together. The famous Lufthansa-heist for example, where the 3 gangsters got away with $5 million in cash and $875.000 in jewellery, making it the biggest heist of their era. \n\nPaul had a guy in Tampa, Florida owing him money so he sent Jimmy and Henry to go scare him off and collect the money. Jimmy and Henry thought it'd be funny to hold him over a lion's hedge to threaten the poor guy, he then quickly gave them the money. Little did the two gangsters know that the poor guy's sister was a typist for the FBI. She then filed a complaint against Paul, Jimmy and Henry. The 3 of them get sentenced 10 years in jail.\n\nThe betrayals in the movie really hurt deeply. Seeing a bond being built that is stronger than family being broken down, it's really sad to watch. When Henry promised Paul he wasn't doing or dealing drugs, for instance. Typical for Scorsese is to portray all the feelings wit hso many details. Beautiful.\n\nWhat I find funny is that Martin Scorsese gave Samuel L. Jackson, who these days is concidered a big actor, a really small, almost unimported roll as Stacks Edwards being the guy who almost joepardized their whole Lufthansa operation.\n\nA lot of famous music was used in the movie, \u2018Look in my eyes' by The chantels for example. They even got Jerry Vale to sing \u2018Pretend you don't see her' at a nightshow in one of the scenes of the movie. These songs are still on my playlist until this day.\n\nOverall I really would recommend the movie for those who like a nice story with a theespoon of comedy and a handful of action, and for those who love to see Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci play in an other Martin Scorsese film. I wouldn't read the book (Wiseguys) before watching the film, otherwise everything will get spoiled and the movie won't be that fun to watch anymore.  If you've watched Scorsese's Casino, and you liked it, I'm sure you'll more than enjoy watching Scorsese's Goodfellas.",

Goodfellas is not about Mafia dons, but about those who exist on a lower level. It's about the bonds that are formed between compatriots in crime, and how betrayal is the most heinous offense imaginable. Cinematography is a highlight and there are long pans and innovative flourishes, all designed to enhance the mood and involve the viewer in the action.

It is funny, terrifying, intricate and manages to educate you about the inner workings of the Mafia and their interaction with the U.S Government without feeling overstuffed, in fact you are left wanting more. Calling this Scorsese's best film will most likely be controversial, Raging Bull (1980) and Taxi Driver (1976) are also beloved but I believe that what makes Goodfellas special is that it makes Scorsese's trademarks violence, crime and Catholic guilt accessible and enjoyable to a wide audience.\n\nOne of the most iconic anti-heroes in all of cinema history Henry Hill, Ray Liotta, begins working with Jimmy Conway, Robert De Niro, and Tommy DeVito, Joe Pesci, under the tutelage of Mafioso Paulie Cicero, Paul Sorvino. He begins a relationship with the Jewish Karen Friedman, played by the very Italian Lorraine Bracco, who he ends up marrying despite the protestations of those around him. When he murders a member of the Gambino crime family he becomes even more deeply rooted in the gangster lifestyle. From this point on we see his life develop over the next 25 years as the Mafia's relationship with the American Government and his relationship with Karen becomes strained. Scorsese manages to cram so much into 2 hours and 15 minutes and the film almost never drags.\n\nThe script, written by Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese and based upon Pileggi's novel \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~Wiseguys', moves at a fast pace whilst also providing incredible detail and including scenes that are funny and tragic at once. In particular the voiceover, a motif that would become a clich\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 (C) in future gangster movies, is well used as we hear the inner dialogue of both Karen and Henry at various points during the film providing exposition and entertaining insights. Take the scene in which Karen threatens to shoot Henry, a suspenseful, well-directed 2 and a half minutes, this would be dramatic enough but her explanation of why she stays with him, \"I'm still very attracted to him, why should I let her have him?\" adds a note of sadness that makes the scene more emotionally impactful than it would have otherwise been. It is an absolute crime that this fantastic piece of writing lost an Academy Award to the average, white-savior narrative screenplay for Dances with Wolves.\n\nThe pacing of the film is also excellent, a credit to Scorsese's frequent collaborator editor Thelma Schoonmaker, with each different strand of the film appearing appropriately proportion on screen. All of the scenes feel necessary, they create a mood, an environment that sticks in your mind well after having seen the film. The film is extremely watchable because it doesn't give you the space to consider outside issues, you are fully immersed in the experience of watching this film throughout it's running time and each plot development captivates you as much as the last. Again, the Academy made a stupid decision by awarding Dances with Wolves the Best Editing Academy Award when considering the difficulty level in bringing every part of Goodfellas narrative together.\n\nLiotta, giving his most notable performance, is terrific using his at once beautiful and violent eyes to convey the double-edged sword of being on of the many people enamored of him. He goes beyond stereotypes whilst at the same time reveling in them and Liotta is believe throughout the character's long, sweeping arc. Bracco is equally astonishing as his wife with her nasally voice and dark, vulnerable eyes she is convincing as an innocent seduced by a charismatic man, a trashy housewife and a wronged wife. Pesci, who won an Oscar for his role, and De Niro are both perfectly cast being both comically and dramatically talented. The entire cast are well-matched to their roles and it is clear Scorsese placed great value on the acting in this film.\n\nThis is a must-watch for all audiences it is that rare film with tremendous commercial appeal that also earns it critical acclaim. The wide-reaching cultural impact of this film is evidence of it's greatness, how many films has it inspired over the last 29 years? Scorsese is one of the great filmmakers of his era and all of his talents are on display in this film therefore, in my opinion it is his greatest film.",

Just like his other films; the run time really gets to you, there's too much swearing that its literally being force fed to the audience, and most of the characters are completely heartless.

It isn't just some documentary telling the viewer, \"The Mafia is bad,\" but is instead a film that places the viewer in the shoes of a member. Ray Liotta also does an amazing job playing famed gangster Henry Hill, and the movie feels as if it is very much trying to stay to the real life story instead of adding plot points just for theatrics. The discussion of the Lufthansa heist was also very interesting to see from the Mafia's view instead of reading about it from police or news. Overall, the classic Scorsese style, amazing actors such as Liotta, De Niro, and more, as well as the effort to keep the story true makes this film an amazing one to watch!",

The story is based on a true story ad it's taken place from 1955 to 1980. It tells a story about Henry Hill played by Ray Liotta narrating about his life as a gangster. Lorraine Bracco sometimes narrates as Karen Hill, aside from that, Ray Liotta does all the narrating. It's in the book. It's in the non-fiction book by Nicholas Pileggi called Wiseguy. Of course, everyone knows the scene where Henry tells Tommy that he is funny cause the way he tells stories and Tommy says \"What do you mean I'm funny?\" \"Funny how, I mean funny like I'm a clown, I amuse you?\" This is a famous scene for Joe Pesci as his acting is incredible. As far as this film goes, this is a perfect film for everyone who is a huge fan of Martin Scorsese. It has a great story that is so true, fantastic Oscar winning acting by everyone who played great characters and best direction from Martin Scorsese. It's everyone's favourite film of all time and considered one of the greatest films of all time. Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.",

On one hand, he was a horrible and violent human being... on the other hand though, some of his scenes were most entertaining to watch. Some may say that this film glorifies being a gangster. I don't think I'd describe it that way, as we see in detail some of the problems these people encounter. The first thing I remember doing after watching this movie was research on the real people this film is based off of, those being Henry Hill and Jimmy Conway. The story is beautifully told and the characters learn and grow as the years go on. Ray Liotta was made famous, and rightfully so. He plays probably one of the best anti-heroes that I've seen. Dialogue is smart and realistic in a brilliant screenplay written by Scorsese himself alongside Nicholas Pileggi. Goodfellas is a legendary masterpiece that should be discussed in all film classes if it isn't already.",

The real problem I have with this movie is that it is way to long, and yes I know The Godfather is long but it's reasonably long.

            "content": "Goodfellas, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a film that exemplifies great storytelling. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, both the story side of it, as well as the execution. Pacing-wise, the story moved very swiftly and efficiently, never pausing for too long. I enjoyed that the story was told both from Henry and Karen's perspective. In the film, it is later revealed that Henry and Karen are telling their story to someone who can potentially put them in the witness protection program, in an effort to get them out of the life that they had previously come to know and love. On the directing side, Scorsese does a great job of both following and breaking the rules. The initial establishing shot of Henry driving in the car utilizes the rule of thirds, putting Henry neatly on the right side of the frame. Scorsese breaks what we systematically expect from a film through his use of steadicam shots. He uses this approach when we are introduced to a new character or environment, allowing us to move through the space with that character and feel that we are a part of the experience, rather than just on the outside looking in. One scene that this is utilized in is when we first meet the \"goodfellas\" associated with Henry. Scorsese has a steadicam moving throughout the club, pausing on each character as the camera goes by, saying hello to Henry - but also introducing them to us as the audience. This shot also demonstrates use of pace and perspective. Scorsese uses this approach once again, when Henry first brings Karen to the Copacabana. The camera moves through the club as if it were a person exploring the culture of the environment for the first time. This allows us as viewers to see Henry's world from Karen's perspective. Another approach that I appreciated was Scorsese's ability to drop small hints and set up what would come later. When Henry's girlfriend is showing off her new apartment to her friends, on their way out of her room - Henry and Sandy (one of the girlfriend's friends) show a very flirting, knowing look. Sandy later becomes involved with Henry, and a major part of his drug ring.",

In the first act, we are provided with Henry's upbringing and his introduction into the mob: his rise. The second act, provides us with Henry, Pesci, and De Niro in the prime of their lives. And finally, the third act shows us how it all falls apart. It should be noted that the narration throughout the film, definitely adds a greater sense of personality.\n\nOverall, Scorsese pulls off a masterclass in depicting Henry Hill's life style, and even with the film sitting at almost two and a half hours, it doesn't drag. Every scene contains meaning, and provides a greater sense of perception into the social hierachy/inner-workings of the mob.",

From a technical standpoint, you couldn't really ask for more. Plenty of long takes and luscious cinematography keep you glued to the screen, as does the terrific acting from everyone; particularly Joe Pesci, of whom's performance has become iconic at this point. On the negative side, I didn't connect as much emotionally with the characters as I would have liked. Perhaps this is either unintentional, unavoidable or both, but it meant that certain moments didn't quite have the impact I was hoping for. It's a minor quibble, but when you're dealing with something as acclaimed as 'Goodfellas' is, it's important to make clear. Even so, the film was always riveting, and Martin Scorsese makes it all look so easy. It's violent, cruel and unsettling - and all the better for it.",

Perhaps, but what really made Goodfellas unique was the way Scorsese made the mundane cinematic, and mocked the over stylized storyboarding of the most obvious mainstream director cliches. In short, Scorsese didn't film a movie, as much as he captured the absurdity and misanthropy of real life.  Goodfellas' strange but real world sense of humor and palpable tension between egomaniacal figures paved the way for Tarantino and David Chase's The Sopranos. In essence, a deconstruction and caricatured rebuilding of what a crime drama ought to be.\n\nMartin Scorsese's masterpiece features a lot of unlikable characters and snitching wise guys. But Tommy DeVito was so menacing he managed to play antagonist to even the bullies and murderers that trusted him. Joe Pesci's brings this character to life and gradually builds fear from its basest element, since in plain view Tommy Devito is short, goofy looking and has the voice of an Italian clown.

I am really digging mafia movies now and I'm trying to watch all the greats. This is definitely one that I would remember and watch again. All the jokes in this movie are hilarious especially how the main character of this movie laughs, he laughs so weird and I can't stop laughing at him because of his laugh. If he really laughs like that in real life I would sorta feel bad for laughing at him but nothing. The story is fantastic and this movie makes you feel for the characters and you don't want anything bad to happen to them, only a few movies can do that and this movie is one of them. Can't wait to see this movie again.",

When it's all in a days work, when what we do is our job. When we are always working, when it pays a lot. When working makes more sense then learning. When we are always working people making everyone happy. Working other people how they ought to do their job. Working our own people when establishing whose boss. Working to make everything run smooth and when it doesn't we cancel it and start new. When we are working just about everyone when they work for us or we find out who they working for and work them. When our system works when we know how to work the in and out of things that makes others wonder how it works. When we are not working we lay low when somethings are not working when it comes to women whom we happen to work. When working crowds, making everyone happy and relaxed to working certain jobs it's all mystery. When we are constantly working when everybody wants something and we got the goods. When somethings work when we lie when we cannot jeopardize other people's work. When everyone works somethings everyone is in need of an answer. When working means the payout in return. When we give up on things that don't work. When we have to use force to things that work us when we reject them.

When certain things work when they last the test of time and fit a purpose in our life and many lives. When our institutions are built on things that work when we continue to enjoy what it represents and brings to us. When our system works when we can't help it when it's in us. When we are always working on something when we are constantly in need to please and offer ourselves to others. When we are always working to make ourselves look good, feel good, know who is no good and just give the goods on where it's good and knowing we have it good. When sometimes working around other institutions causes trouble when it conflicts with other people's work when it's the law. When what works we need to cut corners whether it's legit or unlegit. When we always have to work others whom work us or comply. When somethings only work when we trust whom we work with and for. When we don't mind working the nerves of those whom we can push around when they think they are small. When we know no one works us up without getting away with it. When we must work some people to hide what we are doing. When we don't need to work anyone when all we want is some attention, some appreciation, some courtesy to those we like around. When we know we have it good but need to work to be around. When some work leads to more work. When we need to secure the future of our work by getting rid of the competition. When some work runs clock work when we schedule what we got to do with the right people and time to make everything work. When we know how to work a crowd when emotions run high. When we mix work with pleasure when we have to make sure work is going good to reassure some people. When somethings don't work when it's hard to remove.

When what we do others want us to not work out and take our work. When we get into deep into work we begin to show signs of unraveling that we need to rewind and get back on track. When somethings work for us when they are passed down to us proven to work that we continue. When we all have hidden workers working for us, when all eyes are on us. When somethings work when they are harmless and we play it safe. When we please everyone whom need things to work when there are multiple institutions that we need to consider. When sometimes work is only as good as those behind it. When we are gone from work too long our workers are no longer what they used to be that we need to straighten. When we find new means of work, with new goods, new workers and same workers but with a different work ethic. When keeping with appearances means we are always caring where, whom, when and what we look that naturally there is always plenty of work in every place. When our work is all over the place when it's hard to trace and keep track of. When somethings work when we keep our head low for awhile. When somethings don't work when we lose our head and focus and begin to unravel when we are paranoid. When we need to make sure things work when we bring good tidings and joy. When we need to get rid of some workers when we need a bigger cut. When we need to cover our tracks when our work is compromised. When we need to be one step ahead of those whom want to shut us down to make sure things work. When we have no choice but to make it work that we get rid of what bothers us. When following someone's actions has proven to work that we continue. When we are following the wrong people when the right people start showing up in different places that makes following not work. When having connections everywhere and in different instutions makes for somethings to workout perfectly. When we have a proven system that works when we have the goods on our own people that we know and trust have our backs and are only 100% one of us. When work is like family and there are only close members and extended members that we work the outer edges till we reach deep within. When sometimes we don't count other members we least expect that make it hard for us to work. When we can't keep an eye on everything to make sure everything works well with the right people. When overtime, over use and under hostile pressured situations we are over worked and faulty and make mistakes. When somethings work just fine but conflict when we work. When things only work we have business accepting the goods, but they no good, no work. When we have to face it, our work is done here and call the whole thing off. \n\nWhen what works we are paranoid won't work when all eyes are us. When we rely on those to work, they work and others dont care to listen and work however they please when they don't know how some things work to do their own thing. When we got everything covered and know such plans will work we relax and take a hit when we are as high as a kite when some plans work too well they are meant to feel this high like a rolling stone. When we don't see we covered loose ends, that our plans don't work and we are busted. When we have to get rid of what we have been working on to hide a trace of our work from others from seeing. When we could not work permanently when we cross paths with those whom could put us out of work permanently. When we need somethings to work when we have backup plans to work. When we are worked up over our work to have no work. When being a boss we rely on our workers to work, and be happy that we work for some people to provide us work. When the way we work we are smooth operators when we get rid of the waste. \n\nWhen the system only works when you comply with how other institutions work and agree to work with them. When working for other people especially your enemies means you abandon your work and co workers. When some institutions are meant to stay when they work and others that don't work disappear. When some systems that don't work we don't take the blame or fall for. When we don't know how things work, or whose pushing the buttons, to know that it doesn't work out when you can't keep it up for too long and you let many people down who rely on work to work. When you try to make somethings workout and they don't, then you have angry grieving people that no longer working or with some people who worked for our livlihood that you don't consider. When you guarantee that things are proven to work and you get people to bet their life on it, and it fails then best believe you will be worked on when your responsible for blood & no work. When somethings only workout when you connect the two together and get your connects to make it all work until it all collapses.",

            "content": "In my review of The Untouchables, I argued that Hollywood has struggled to do justice to Al Capone because he had effectively \"become the clich\u00e9 of the Hollywood gangster\". By extension, American cinema has all too often succumbed to the dangers of 'big man history'; it get so easily seduced by the often exciting mythology of famous individuals that its depiction of said people loses all semblance of reality or believability. Even in cases where truth is stranger than fiction, Hollywood often presents it in a way which makes us suspect that we are not being told the truth at all.\n\nWhen Nicholas Pileggi wrote Wiseguy, he said that he wanted to \"get hold of a soldier in Napoleon's army\". He wanted, in other words, the observations of an ordinary player in the drama, stripped of all the spin and legend-making that surrounds the leading men. Martin Scorsese as a director has often excelled in finding the remarkable, striking or shocking in ordinary surroundings, and of using subtle changes in storytelling (including his patented use of music) to wrong-foot his audience. The combination of these two talents is thereby a match made in heaven, and when you marry it to three cracking central performances, Goodfellas becomes a truly great film.\n\nThere is a very fine line in cinema between depicting something in painstaking detail and glamourising it. Films as varied as Green Street and Death Wish have fallen into the trap of praising something utterly wretched and despicable in their (alleged) desire to be as accurate and realistic as possible about the people involved. So often criminals in crime dramas or thrillers are set up in the beginning as the people whom we should revile, but their exciting exploits and rebellious attitudes (as written by Hollywood) can often make them more exciting than the law-abiding citizens (especially when Kevin Costner is involved).\n\nGoodfellas, like Killing Them Softly more than two decades after it, succeeds because it rejects any rose-tinted picture of a life on the wrong side of the law - and does it without it feeling like a moral lesson being hammered into our heads. But where Andrew Dominik's film set its criminals up as lowlifes and then made them sink lower, Scorsese pulls us in slowly, offering us the romantic or stylish side to Italian-American crime and then pulling the rug from under our feet when it's too late to run away. Starting the film in media res with the death of Billy Batts is not just a way of avoiding it being a run-of-the-mill 'rise and fall' story: by starting at the point at which things turn, we know from the outset that however good it seems, it won't last and it won't pay.\n\nAny romance that remains within Scorsese's film is very much ironic, with his attention to detail and knowledge of his own heritage being used to make the more violent and graphic aspects ring all the more true. With The Godfather and its sequels, there was always an element of nostalgia for 'the old country', for the traditional structures of Sicilian life and the Mafia's role in preserving that order. Goodfellas acknowledges this heritage (and, through De Niro's presence, the influence of Francis Ford Coppola's work), but the families it presents are dysfunctional and undesirable; the man are aggressive, unfaithful and two-faced, while the women are either downtrodden, air-headed or too drugged up to care.\n\nOne of the most common themes of crime films is the idea of people turning to crime because  living a conventional, law-abiding life doesn't bring the comfort or level of luxury which people crave or covet. Films about con artists, such as Catch Me If You Can or The Sting, often set up straight-ahead characters as being fundamentally feeble, poor and undesirable in a bid to make the lifestyle of their leading characters seem more attractive. Goodfellas cuts straight to the chase in this regard: Henry Hill becomes a gangster because he likes the riches it brings, and because making a lot of money by robbing or scamming people is easier than working an honest, badly-paid job. The film tricks us into rationalising Henry's actions, so that we berate ourselves when things go south, cursing that we should have seen it coming.\n\nIn a further comparison with The Godfather, Goodfellas is very interested in the way that criminals operate like dysfunctional families. There are the same concerns about blood and race (Italian vs Irish), the same rivalries and jockeying for position, and the same mix of respect and dread which surrounds the paternal figure. But where Michael Corleone is an insider desperate to get out of the family business, only to be pulled back in repeatedly through his loyalty, Henry is an outsider for whom Paulie serves as a surrogate father. In both cases the leading men feel pressured to act a certain way or fulfil certain roles based on the expectations of the father figure, backed up by tradition and their shared values.\n\nSo much of what makes Goodfellas great lies in the manner of its storytelling. In the excellent making-of documentary Getting Made, Pileggi and Scorsese discussed the importance of Ray Liotta's voiceover, with the emphasis being on the language used rather than its use to move the plot along. Rather than being used to \"patch a little crack in the script\", as Pileggi put it, the voiceover gives us a detailed insight into Henry's thought process; by giving us the little details and observations about daily life, he feels more like a real person. As his reactions grow more believable, he becomes more relatable and we get pulled further in, going along with his decisions even as the fear eats away in the background.\n\nThis approach is further reinforced by the use of music. In the post-Quentin Tarantino world, where using unusual, sometimes incongruous pop songs to accompany a scene is practically normal, it's easy to forget just how skilfully Scorsese marries music and moving images. His seemingly encyclopaedic knowledge means that he very rarely goes for the obvious or mediocre choice, and his taste is excellent. No-one else would have chosen to put Cream's 'Sunshine Of Your Love' as the backing to the sequence where Robert De Niro decides in his head to do away with those involved in the Lufthansa heist. Watching it back several times, it makes the scene all the more complete, to the point where it doesn't work without it.\n\nIn his review of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Mark Kermode said that all of Tim Burton's films were \"attempting to burst into song.\" Scorsese may not have made a bona fide musical since New York, New York, but he has retained his intuitive understanding of how music can convey a character's innermost thoughts. Even when he's cantering through a lot of plot to move things forward in a montage, it feels deft and personal rather than being padding. There is no better example of this than the sequence designed around 'Layla' by Derek and the Dominos: it flows perfectly, possessing the spot-on timing and choreography that Stanley Kubrick achieved with his SteadyCam shots, but without being clinical or drawing attention to the artifice of the situation.\n\nThe whole film looks excellent, thanks in part to the cinematography of Michael Ballhaus, who had previously worked with Scorsese on After Hours, The Colour of Money and The Last Temptation of Christ. He captures the period feel to a tee, bringing out just enough of the colours and styles of the setting without it feeling like a pastiche. His understanding of Scorsese's visual style was so precise that very often little coverage of a given scene was needed; shots like the long track through the restaurant were shot multiple times from the same position, rather than shooting with multiple cameras at once and then stitching the best bits together in the edit.\n\nThe central performances in Goodfellas are first-class, with each of the three leading men being given a chance to shine. Ray Liotta is terrific as Henry: you can see and appreciate the amount of research and preparation which he put in, and yet it's not mannered or restrained - he lets loose when he can and is just guarded enough when he needs to be. Robert De Niro is great as Jimmy Conway, bringing all his familiar skills to the party but working hard in every scene to be true to the character rather than just leaning on past successes. And Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his performance, is a firecracker, managing to be impulsive and dangerous without seeming over-the-top. The supporting cast is also excellent, particularly Paul Sorvino as Paulie and the smashing Lorraine Bracco, who beautifully balances Karen's desperation, jealousy and feeling of being in slightly over her head.\n\nGoodfellas is a great crime film and one of the highest peaks in Scorsese's illustrious career. While it does lose a little momentum in the last 15 minutes, everything up to that point is nigh-on perfect, with great performances being matched by a tight script and highly proficient direction, creating a compelling cinematic experience which more than holds up to repeat viewing. It remains one of the greatest films of the early-1990s and one of the benchmarks against which all subsequent crime films must be measured.",

Let's talk first about the film script that tells the story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a boy who always wanted to be a gangster, here we have a complete narrative of his life, from the rise to the fall, through his dramas, love, death , Disagreements and glare. We do not have here a highly organized Italian mafia, our characters are not the \"Bosses\", quite the contrary, their criminal life begins with robberies and ends with traffic, their operations are well explained, such as the development of all characters, even characters Like that of Paulie who has little screen time are well developed. The photograph of the film is good, it is not memorable, but it knows how to play colors very well on screen, we do not have that dark palette as it is usually the mafia movies, here the color palette is warm, the warm weather is always present and the trail Sound is spectacular, nothing original tracks, only songs from the time when the film is passing, that passes all that sarcastic climate is counterpoint to what is being shown on screen, it is also worth mentioning the great editing and sound mixing Of the film. Joe pesci is one of the best supporting actors in the cinema, and he is completely incredible, and it's good that Scorsese did not manage to play the leading role for De niro - who does a sober and convincing performance - but for Ray Liotta, That in certain moments is even alien to the personage, but in the great part of the film delivers a mafioso very cunning, intelligent and even unconcerned with the world and its consequences. At the end of the day we have a movie that keeps its rhythm and the high level in all the acts, it is not completely perfect and not a masterpiece of the seventh art, but surely it is a spectacular movie.",

The best moments are when he, DeNiro, and Pesci are on screen, because it's both homely and tense. The rest of the cast is amazing it's like family on film.

            "content": "It has taken me some time to get around to GoodFellas, mostly because I have to work up an appetite for a good gangster/crime film and that can take time. When I finally got around to the film, I once again, as was the case with L.A. Confidential and Memento, a bit disappointed. First and foremost, this is certainly not the high point of Scorsese's career. Between The Departed, The Aviator, Casino, Raging Bull and Taxi Driver, there are at least five other films with a much better claim to that title and the overhype of this film bugs me just a little bit. That isn't to say that GoodFellas isn't good, especially from a directing standpoint. It's excellently executed from start to finish, with as fine of a polish as you would expect from Scorsese. However, like Memento, it has a key issue and that issue is Ray Liotta. Like Guy Pearce, he's a gritty actor who get's a lot of recognition, mostly due to particular elements of his filmography. And like Guy Pearce in Memento, Liotta just can't handle the lead position. Liotta's problem is twofold. Unlike the greats like Al Pacino in The Godfather and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Departed, Liotta has real trouble conveying emotion. Like many stars of his era, he has a rock for a face and as we have come to realize today, that doesn't make for a great actor, especially as films start to age. His other issue is with overacting, most notably in the most famous scene of the film, at least in terms of popular culture. This is the classic laugh scene used in so many memes today and while the cultural impact of this scene (and the rest of the movie) is undeniable, the reality is that Liotta overacts the scene badly and negatively impacts the flow of the film when it's being watched. The guy simply can't emote and his sharp career decline can attest to producers figuring that out (check him out now on Shades of Blue with Jennifer Lopez). Liotta's issues hamper the film throughout and the actress playing his wife isn't any better. We see far too little of De Niro, which is truly unfortunate. Ultimately, GoodFellas is an important film, with great cultural reach and clear influence on the crime genre. However, the film hasn't aged well and casting choices that probably seemed perfect in 1990 are starting to look pretty silly. The result is a mixed bag, a film that is clearly a cultural marker but has trouble proving its importance to the first time viewer.",

Hill's story begins as a youth growing up in Brooklyn in a Italian American community, and beginning to work for the mafia to make a name for himself.  The story follows his rise to fame, and all the glory and luxury that comes with it.  \n\nThe film is filled with Scorsese staples: Rolling Stones songs, tracking steadicam sequences, montages of people getting killed, quick and punchy dialogue, and a New York setting.  The movie more or less defines the mob movie genre, in a way that The Godfather doesn't, forgoing the showcase of a life of crime as a mystique filled meditation, and instead portraying the bravado filled, work-like environment that pays well, but carries heavy risks.  \n\nTL;DR - 9/10\nOne of Scorsese's best films, and in my opinion, one of the greatest gangster films ever made.

It's hard to imagine a world without Goodfellas - its savvy and stylish mob strands running deep through everything from The Sopranos (which winningly hijacked a number of Scorsese's actors) to The Simpsons (a gangster character named Louie bears such a striking resemblance to Frankie Carbone that actor Frank Silvero sued). As far back as you can remember, this is what mob films looked like - brutish, bold and somehow funny to boot. Spanning 30 years in its 2 plus hours, the film is based on a real memoir (Nicholas Pileggi's Wise Guys, which tells the story of Henry Hill) and details a very real crime (the 1978 Lufthansa Heist) but it purposely glamorizes a villainous way of life only to beat it against the rocks with the cold hard truth ... though you'd probably still take that risk if it got backed with such a rocking doo-wopped soundtrack. \n\nIn this R-rated crime saga now celebrating its 25th anniversary, Henry Hill (Liotta) and his associates (De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino) work their way up through the mafia hierarchy to pull off one of the biggest cash heists in U.S. history. \n\nThe performances ground audiences, however, establishing real persons that never feel like characters. Joe Pesci rightly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but there's not a bad turn in the bunch. Less showy, Paul Sorvino's sedate steeliness as a mafia chieftain proves every bit as Oscar worthy. Sitting atop Scorsese's ridiculously accomplished CV, Goodfellas rivals Taxi Driver and Raging Bull as the legendary director's most stylish and standout work to date. \n\nBottom line: Mobbed Up",

And he approached Goodfellas in a way he never had with any of his films, releasing an arsenal of technical tricks to match the frenetic pacing of the script; dueling narratives, freeze-frames and tracking shots all rise to the occasion and keep Goodfellas from being just another cannoli fest. As evidenced by the shocking opener, Goodfellas isn't afraid to get its hands dirty and spare no blood or bullets in showing you exactly how Henry Hill and his buddies climbed the ranks of the Mafia. Where The Godfather positioned itself in the dark corridors of Mafiosi management, GoodFellas rolls around in blood and sawdust on the shop floor.",

Goodfellas is widely regarded as one of the finest films ever made, and I did not enjoy it at all. I fully recognize that it is well-made and probably tells one of the most engaging tales you can ask for in a gangster movie. Some of the shots are simply brilliant and I even tolerated the dual voice-overs (although I'm not convinced they added much to the film.) The real issue is simply that I don't like gangster films. It's a genre that I cannot comprehend why people enjoy. I mean in this movie we watch dozens of lying, cheating, stealing, and murdering people and we're supposed to care about anything that happens to them? These are literally the worst people in existence, and I can't stand looking at their faces after the first 2 hours. Clearly it's a matter of taste, and Goodfellas is totally not my style of film. Based on the kind of praise it gets and the overall quality of the production I can see that, for those who like the genre, this is a shining gem. I kind of wish I could comprehend what it was that people find enjoyable about these films, but I'm just not wired to like crooks or stories about them.",

            "content": "What can be said about this film that hasn't already been said before and why a review now you ask?  Well in case you didn't know this has very recently undergone a long overdue 4K restoration supervised by Scorcese himself obviously for it's 25th Anniversary, 25 you say yes 25 makes you feel old doesn't it?\n\nAs well as a star studded screening at the Tribeca film festival that bought it to a close, following hot on the heels inevitably is the new Blu ray reissue.  Is it worth the upgrade, well if you have a player and only have this on DVD then it's a given but even if you have previous HD effort released some years back then this is still worth the money in your pocket.  Warner Brothers aren't one's for forking out for new prints and this looks the best it has ever had on a home format.\n\nAlthough please don't go expecting the film looking like it was shot yesterday, one of the biggest misconceptions about the format is that some people expect sparkling resolution.  I remember some years back when Coppola's masterpiece The Godfather Part 1 and 2 arrived on HD that some individuals were horrified it didn't look like Transformers 2.  Completely missing the point, blu ray allows the film maker to revisit their work and return it as close to what it looked like on the cinema screen when it was first released and like GF 1 & 2 Marty as lovingly made this look the best it's looked since it's original theatrical release.  Natural colours, an immersive sound stage that truly makes that soundtrack sing, certainly makes any previous version look redundant.\n\nThe story is a given, the ascent and then descent of street level mob member Henry Hill and his eventual capture leading to him informing against his associates and friends.  Hill's story is the basis for Nicholas Pileggi's book which Scorcese and the author based their screenplay on.  There might be people out there that don't like this but if you have any appreciation of pure cinema then I can fail to see how you can not acknowledge it's brilliance.  It's without doubt one of the most influential films of the last 30 years and it would be hard to think of a world with out Goodfellas in it. You can't think of a more electrifying slice of celluloid to kick of the 1990's, it blazed a trail that saw the likes of Tarantino, PT Anderson and David Fincher follow in it's wake.\n\nTarantino pretty much copied it's style, yes he's adept at placing the needle in just the right place on his turntable but Marty got there first and was doing that kind of thing as early as Mean Streets. Although it is here where he elevates it to an art form.  From the moment Tony Bennett's Rags To Riches blares out your speakers right up to Sid Viscous' OTT and extravagant version of My Way closes the film,  it's clear that Scorcese would make one hell of a DJ at any party.\n\nIt's not only cinema that owes it a debt, it has entered into popular culture in a way that very few films have, as adored and celebrated as the Godfather and rightly so.  David Chase creator of ground breaking TV opus HBO's The Soprano's proclaims it his Koran.  It's not hard to see why. Although the crime series undoubtedly has allot to thank the Corleone family for, it's Goodfellas that it most resonates with. The Godfather dealt with the higher echelons of the mob and was essentially a film about family whereas Scorcese's film is about the streets, other gangster films would follow and some very impressive but Goodfella's is the blue print. Chase's series is probably the medium that really delivered it it's greatest tribute as well as being original enough to be regarded as the trail blazer in it's own right.\n\nChase's not only borrows the influence but also it's cast, watching it in light of Soprano's the roster of actors he cast in his series.  Most notably Lorraine Bracco Soprano's very own Dr Melfi. Those that know their Soprano's will also recognise Paulie 'Walnuts' Gualtieri , Salvatore 'Big Pussy' Bonpensiero, Phil Leotardo and of course most notably Tony's nephew Christopher Moltisanti, respectively Tony Sirico, Vincent Pastore, Frank Vincent and Michael Imperioli.\n\nThough not to get carried away with the supporting players, Goodfellas\nis probably most well know for it's main players most notably Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci as Henry Hill, James 'Jimmy' Conway and Tommy Devito.  Neither actor has quite since been so brilliant.  Liotta was basking in the acclaim of stealing Johnathan's Demme's Something Wild when Scorcese cast him as his lead character, Liotta while a hugely talented actor has never quite lived up to the promise he displayed quite devastatingly here.  DeNiro is sadly to say a former shadow of himself these days, he did follow this with some great turns in Heat, Scorsese's own Casino (his last time with his friend and collaborator at the helm) and Jackie Brown but this is really the last time that the actor that gave us the Young Vito Corleone, Travis Bickle and Jake Lamotta came that close again.  Pesci here and with DeNiro in Casino also has rarely been as terrifyingly despicable, a uncharacteristically sympathetic role in Oliver Stones JFK aside his acting as been as memorable.  Pesci was also rewarded with an Oscar for best supporting actor at 1991 Academy Awards for his portrayal of one the most frightening cinematic protagonists in cinema history.  Lorraine Bracco's contribution can't be underestimated and Paul Sorvino says more with his eyes than some actors can with their mouths, his quiet relaxed presence no less notable.\n\nAlthough the Academy once again ignored Marty and gave the Oscar for best film and director to Kevin Costner for Dances With Wolves. It seems madness to think Pesci was the only win of the night but then again despite Costner's film still being remembered it most certainly hasn't aged as well or held up like Goodfellas has. Just like The Godfather 1 & 2 it's littered with memorable scenes, the tracking shot that follows Henry and Karen into the Copacabana sound tracked masterfully by \"Then He Kissed Me\" by The Crystals and the Derek and the Dominoes Layla piano exit will never seem quite the same after the camera moves over that pink Cadillac revealing it's gruesome find.  This just amongst many moments this film displays, Scorcese and crew displaying a true mastery of their craft. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing combined with Michael Balhaus' cinematography, an example of a synthesis of their talents, the results being Scorcese and crew are like the cinematic Caravaggio's,  the results visceral and real as they display the violence and excess on the screen.\n\nGoodfellas is simply a masterpiece and to call it one of the greatest films of all time is nothing than what it deserves. It's director hasn't quite touched it's brilliance again and while Casino is another masterful example of his talents and some prefer it, it doesn't quite touch these heights.  Marty having become of recent are far more commercial film maker, delivering box office successes and a great partnership with an actor who seems to have replaced Bobby D as his muse in the shape of the talented Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nAlthough it's only his last film the brilliant The Wolf of Wall Street that has approached the anarchy and excess that defined Goodfellas, it's unlikely he'll get that fiery and incendiary again but that probably the way it should be, so fire up the home entertainment system sit back and indulge in this visual and audible feast.",

            "content": "When Scorsese embarked upon the journey of making GoodFellas, he had already created two landmarks of cinema in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, laurels enough for anybody to rest on. But skill such as Scorsese's cannot be displayed in two films alone, no matter how brilliant the pair of them are. And so, even as it seemed he had hit his peak with Jake La Motta, Scorsese wowed audiences and critics alike with the character based gangster film to trump all gangster films, GoodFellas.\u00a0\n\nGoodFellas revolves around Henry Hill, a gangster through and through. Living in the hayday of organised crime, Henry is given the world on a silver platter, or so he thinks. We follow Henry's life as he and his two partners in crime Jimmy and Tommy encounter murder, prison, women, drugs and the dark side of life on the street.\u00a0\n\nIf you look at top 100 lists of movies all over the world, you are guaranteed to find this film in there. The reason? Because it's perfect. Basically. The direction is... well it's Scorsese, what more do I really need to say. The acting is spot on, picking up an Academy Award for Joe Pesci, the music is fantastic, the script is beyond reproach and the message behind it all is shown with beautiful poignancy. Seriously. Perfect.\u00a0\n\nThe direction. Anybody who is a fan of or has seen a Scorsese film will know that he is the grandaddy of directing. His flair for camerawork and capturing exactly what he wants is unparalleled. He uses a combination of slow-zooms, fast-zooms, quick-tracks, slow-tracks, all manner of camera movements to stunning effect, creating each feeling without a word being said onscreen. His work in GoodFellas is some of his best as a collective including a now famous tracking shot, choreographed to cinematic perfection through the back of a restaurant. The feeling of being a part of the action and being among these shady characters is not accidental; Scorsese's use of first person camera on beautiful steadicam puts you in the same room as what's onscreen and gives you an up close example of Henry's life.\u00a0\n\nThe purity of the acting of the acting here makes it sometimes undetectable, scarily so in some sequences. It's more than just getting down an accent here, it's getting inside a character's skin, becoming someone else entirely, and our leads deliver. What would you expect from Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Robert de Niro? Liotta plays Hill, our main character, to perfection. The sometimes skittish, often violent and ever-on-the-lookout character is perfectly portrayed by Liotta. Everything from his gestures to his mannerisms to the way he talks around different people is spot-on. You can sense the fear which comes from a lifetime of unpredictability in his surroundings lurking behind his eyes and the uncertainty which surrounds and permeates him simultaneously. Pesci is fantastic as the frinetic, unpredictable and arrogant Tommy, merciless as he is pitiful, he's a very funny guy. His motor mouth is often overwhelming and can put off some viewers with the amount of expletives cramming to unleash themselves from his lips. Robert de Niro is great as Jimmy, though he's not as much of a focus point as the other two are. He is utterly convincing in anything he does throughout the film though, no matter how much screen time he has in relation to the other two. Lorraine Bracco is brilliant as Karen Hill, Henry's half lover, half wannabe killer. She doesn't ever seem to be acting so much as reacting most of the time which makes the more intense scenes all the more frighteningly real.\u00a0\n\nScorsese's music choices for the film are always perfect, decorating the sometimes intense violence onscreen with the sounds of Sinatra and the old world. At times, however, it's when he knows not to use music at all which is when his instinct for cinema is it is at its most startling.\u00a0\n\nThe script is amazing. The use of voiceover, which can sometimes be used in coroboration with bad storytelling, is put to fantastic use here, granting us insight and understanding to a world about which we know very little. Often it can feel like a throwaway device, especially when it's forgotten about halfway through the film, but in Scorsese's hands, it would be hard to imagine the film without it. Apart from the voiceover, the rest of the script is just as good, if not better. Just the right amount of quotable lines without seeming engineered, it's a state of heightened realism which is just too much fun to be about the mob, yet darkened with a subtext of danger which hangs over the entire film.\u00a0\n\nBut all of these elements are rendered pointless without the fantastic message which shines through. The feeling of mistrust which radiates from each of the men which are supposedly Henry's \"family\" shows the mob to be what they really are. Where 'The Godfather' elevated these crims to a godlike status in an elevated reality, 'GoodFellas' brings this world crashing back to reality. A ragtag bunch of Italians, Sicilians, Irish and Americans populating a vast organisation whose sole purpose is to rip others off, live outside the law, flout the rules and consider no-one but themselves. These are not the celebrities, heroes or heroines we were lead to believe they were. They are all, every one, scumbags: fearful of those in power, selfish to the core and loyal to their needs and theirs alone. And even after they have cut all ties with their friends and burnt every bridge they ever crossed, all they can think about is the fact that their spaghetti doesn't taste to their standards, oblivious to the fact that someone they once called friend is now spending their life in prison thanks to them. This message which defines the film is the reason that GoodFellas is the greatest gangster film ever created and one of the greatest films ever period.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThat brilliant tracking shot through the back of a restaurant to the foot of the stage. A perfect example of the flaunting of power, the exploitation of intimidation and the unthinkingness of it all in one perfectly directed sequence.",

Paul Sorvino is absolutely outstanding here as the gang's patriarch and a solid Robert De Niro, unsurprisingly, doesn't disappoint. Joe Pesci, as Liotta's brother-in-crime, is also very strong, taking home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his commendable efforts. \n\nScorsese co-wrote the piece with crime author Nicholas Pileggi, upon whose book the film is based, and it's the strength of the screenplay (which apparently contained dialogue ad-libbed in rehearsals) that ties the film together so nicely. Thelma Schoonmaker's tight editing and the eye-popping set and costume design combine to give us a sense of time, place and the exhilarating lifestyle of multiple players of this dangerous game. \n\nA magnificent production with all departments putting in their very best, this is a resounding masterpiece and one of the greatest films to come out of Scorsese's prolific career.",

Martin Scorsese's classic and masterful look at the despicable folks that make up the world of the mafia.  It has often been imitated (even by the director himself), but it has yet to be equalled in the way it brings story and stylized direction together so perfectly.\r\n\r\nWith all that priase, is this the greatest mob movie ever made?  I must admit I still have a soft spot for \"The Godfather\", but this film is nearly its equal.\r\n\r\nBased on the best seller \"Wiseguys\", the film tells the story of mobster turned FBI informant, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta).  Hill idolizes the mobsters in his Brooklyn neighborhood.  He starts out running errands for them, but his devotion helps him move up in the ranks.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years he is nearly on equal ground.  The FBI, however, is getting closer to a big crack down.  Standout performances, especially from Liotta, and Robert DeNiro as the mentor Jimmy and Joe Pesci as Tommy.  In fact, Pesci won an Oscar for his performance.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/Goodfellas_zpsb75b0e60.jpg[/IMG]",

Also, the language and violence present seems to enhance scenes rather than be in there simply to shock viewers.

The script is well written with dialogue that can only be spoken out loud by gangsters. The characters are cast well with both Ray Liotta and Rober De Niro fitting the parts but it is Joe Pesci who shines as Tommy DeVito. Considering that most of the movies dialogue ended up improvised, Pesci literally comes across as a scary guy with his loud mouth and unpredictable actions. It's a performance that deserved the Oscar that Pesci won.\nOn a second viewing I may solve this issue, but during my first time, I seemed to find myself slightly lost in the storylines involving any of Liotta's female associates. This confusion didn't stop me from following the film and I was able to finish it knowing exactly what had happened in the plot.

GoodFellas shows the thrilling highs and the disastrous lows of gangster life in stylish fashion with excellent direction from Scorsese, very well-written dialogue by Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi, great performances by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Lorraine Bracco, and an outstanding supporting performance by Joe Pesci as the funny and terrifying Tommy DeVito.",

The overbearing voiceover narration constantly reminds you that you're only watching a movie and acts as a cheap exposition tool, avoiding actual character-driven dialogue and marginalizes the acting. The constant wall-to-wall soundtrack is distracting and kind of annoying at parts. There isn't enough content to warrant a 146-minute running time and I was itching for it to end around the 45-minute mark. This was already a book so what's the point of making this into a movie? There's no visual style and almost every creative choice takes away from what's special about film, which is a visual medium. Show, don't just tell.

            "content": "As a Martin Scorsese admirer, it was a dreadful shame that I hadn't seen one of the films he's best known for. Gangster films were huge in the 80's-90's, particularly the Godfather trilogy. Scorsese has produced a few iconic ganster films. This film reminded me why I love his films. \"Goodfellas\" is brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese. The cast includes Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Paul Sorvino.\n\nHenry Hill (Liotta) was just a kid when he got involved with Paul and his crew. Henry always dreamt of becoming a gangster. Paul and his crew welcomed the young man into the family, and he assisted them in distributing their money. After they get busted, Henry renains loyal to his family, and it stays that way for years. Things go awry when Tommy (Pesci) and Jimmy (De Niro) start killing more and more, making their way to the top. \n\nWithout a doubt, this film is known for its performances. Ray Liotta is a wonderful actor, and he's best known for this film. Liotta gives a great performance. He's absolute batshit crazy at times, and despite a few moments of overdoing it, Liotta handles his character well. Henry is crazy, but no ones more crazy than Tommy. Many will recognize him as the mean guy from Home Alone, and Pesci is really mean in this film. He's an absolute psychopath, and Pesci-as you can tell-is having a blast playing him. Finally, Robert De Niro also gives a great performance. De Niro has worked with Scorsese several times, most notably in Taxi Driver. All of the performances are superb, and the cast works perfectly together. There is a scene in the film in which they're all sitting around a table whilst Liotta laughs his ass off. It's priceless.\n\nAmidst the flurry of classic rock music and a fantastic score is a superb crime thriller. Goodfellas is unapologetically brutal, grotesque, and comedically charged. On paper, it's just as brilliant. The script is full to the brim of great one liners and witty dialogue. Michael Ballhaus does a brilliant job behind the camera. I'm a big supporter of using film. It looks really crisp, and the color is much richer than today's digitally shot movies.",

He begins hanging around the mobsters, running errands and doing odd jobs until he gains the notice of local chieftain Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino), who takes him in as a surrogate son. As he reaches his teens, Hill (Ray Liotta) is inducted into the world of petty crime, where he distinguishes himself as a \"stand-up guy\" by choosing jail time over ratting on his accomplices. From that moment on, he is a part of the family. Along with his psychotic partner Tommy (Joe Pesci), he rises through the ranks to become Paulie's lieutenant; however, he quickly learns that, like his mentor Jimmy (Robert DeNiro), his ethnicity prevents him from ever becoming a \"made guy,\" an actual member of the crime family. Soon he finds himself the target of both the feds and the mobsters, who feel that he has become a threat to their security with his reckless dealings.

The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as \"The Godfather\", if not better.\n\n The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is.\n\n Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch.\n\n Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than \"The Godfather\".",

            "content": "I have seen a great amount of Martin Scorcese films. In total, I have seen almost all the movies you have to watch by him, except for Taxi Driver and Casino. The Aviator I liked. The Departed I thought was good. Gangs of New York was fine. Hugo was not good. Raging Bull I thought was great, probably his best film. Overall, from all the hype I've witnessed from Martin Scorsese, honestly, the hype does not live up. His \"style\" is never clear to me, and changes in a lot of his movies. If I watched Hugo and The Departed, I could not tell they were from the same filmmaker, which is not a bad thing, because it takes talent to direct two completely different films with completely different moods. But he makes good movies, the only problem is, the movies aren't great or amazing just good. What brings them down from their tremendous hype is the direction in my opinion. Flaws in pace, random shots and tidbits here and there, inconsistent editing style all leads to the director, and these are the biggest problems I have with Scorsese films. Not this one, though. Kudos to you, Scorsese, you have made a film like Raging Bull that not only has consistent and solid direction, but also has a bit of style that I can actually enjoy. Scorsese brings the script that is Goodfellas and brings it to an excellent height that one can truly enjoy. Now, that script might be problematic here and there, but Goodfellas is thank god not just an average \"good movie\" such as a lot of his others are, but is great, and comes close to being amazing. It's not Raging Bull, but Scorsese is truly at his directing and his cultural height, as this film established his reputation as a filmmaker that without it, I don't think we'd ever see much more of him. I enjoy Scorsese, I do not love him, but I am happy to say I finally enjoyed his direction in this film as I have wanted to for such a long time. And thank god I don't have to stay quiet whenever people talk about Scorsese being amazing, because now I can agree he is great. What a film, and what direction.\r\n\r\n   Goodfellas is a 1990 biography-crime drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by him and Nicholas Pileggi. It stars Ray Liota, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorriane Bracco, Paul Sorvino, and Samuel L. Jackson. It's about Henry Hill (Ray Liota) and his rise and fall in the mob world. An excellent story that much portrays the rise and fall of Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, I think Goodfellas I think Raging Bull is strong and weak when it comes to story. Unlike other mob or gang films, Goodfellas follows the life of one man in the mob only, and how you work, eat, live, and die in it. The dialogue is great, although sometimes could have been written better, and the idea and execution of the idea is good, it's just the progress of the idea that bothered me. Goodfellas is a film like The Aviator that follows the life of one man where we just see him do things, and that's the main plot. Although slight conflicts arise here and there, but for being a film that is near two and a half hours long and where the bulk of the film is seeing a guy do things, that is not very enjoyable. Thanks to the direction, the acting, and the pace the film stayed intriguing. But I wish the film had a clear plot or conflict through, which I did not find and in which i was looking for almost the entire movie. The film is basically split up into things-that-happened rather than chapters or rather as a whole book. Just scene to scene of this guys laugh portrayed in different events. Sometimes they weren't even events, but were rather discussions and character development. This kind of stuff is good for a TV Show, but it does not belong in a limited movie. Still, when Goodfellas show these events, they were indeed good to watch and very tense at times and full of either emotion, laughs, drama, action, or even death. This is where I give Goodfellas a lot of props, for it includes almost every emotion and theme that you can find in films from heartbreak, comedy, depression and suspense. It's a drama film well rounded with comedy and romance that not many films can include. Lord of the Rings, strangely enough, is one of the only other films I can think of that has this many themes that's not rushed and whenever a scene involves something like this it's a good scene to watch and doesn't seem awkward or out of place from the movie. When a film can transition from drama to comedy to gang violence to war smoothly and gives each theme a purpose to the film, that is when the film hits it out of the park when it comes to the writing. Scorsese and Pileggi adapted a biography that explores the life of a man that might not have a clear conflict a lot of the time, but does have clear representation of multiple themes and emotions throughout the course of the film. And I didn't think Scorsese could even write.\r\n\r\n   As I stated in my intro, Scorcese's direction shines like in Raging Bull. Subtle, but strong and nothing too stylish or out or the ordinary. Most of it has solid direction, and only when the script needs it to be does Scorcese change the direction around, such as when he does when Henry Hill is high and paranoid. The pacing was great and nothing lasted longer than it should have, and Scorsese's use of music is signature and is varied throughout the film. At times, it was like Mean Streets though, in which the music was extremely annoying and proved to be too much for a viewer to actually get used to. Sometimes it was like this, but not all the time, and when it was not I was happy to see it was not, and I even enjoyed the music. Two songs really stuck out at me, and one was \"It's Not for Me To Say\" which was used during a dinner scene, and Sid Vicious's rendition of \"My Way\" also struck out. They are both different songs but Scorsese uses them for different moods and to keep the viewer changing emotions during the course of the movie. Also he uses \"Beyond the Sea\", one of my favorite songs, in a dinner scene showcasing the people of the mob in prison. Scorsese's direction did not bother and disturb the film this time like it had in other movies, and he kept it solid and, as I have stated multiple times before, it kept me immersed and glued to the screen, even when there was no suspense but rather easy character development. It was not amazing direction, or even great direction, it was just direction I had always wanted from him and the direction I got. Nothing was overdone and nothing was stylized to much, and that brought his directing skill to the screen. No matter what, you could not keep your eyes away from the movie, even during the scenes where it was simply cooking in a prison. Scorsese directs it to satisfaction.\r\n\r\n   Ray Liota played the lead in this film, and sadly, he was the weakest part of the film. It might be that his character could be played by everyone from Christopher Walken to Matt Damon in younger years, but it was also in part to where he felt a little amateur and over acted at times. His acting shined a little in one scenes where he freaks on his wife, and it was pretty scary to watch that go down, but other than that not much acting talent was shown. Joe Pesci was great as the freaked out, demands-respect sort of mob character, and any moment he could click and go off. I didn't think he necessarily deserved and Oscar for the role, but a nomination was necessary. Even nowadays when watching him other movies like Raging Bull I expect him to lose it at any moment, and that's when you know an actor has truly gotten into one role that he deserves praise for. But in my opinion Robert DeNiro was the best. He was the mob character that was right in the middle. He wasn't on the rise like Henry Hill and he wasn't at the very top like Paul Cicero (played by Paul Sorvino), but he was a respected gangster who had proven a lot but also had some ways more to prove. He becomes paranoid at one point during the movie, which causes his cool and collected persona to plummet, leaving him an emotionally broken man. A good character, and one scene during the movie he breaks down at hearing the death of one of his friends, and that is when I decided DeNiro acted the best in the movie. It made me genuinely sad to see him like that, and I hadn't seen DeNiro break down much in movies, and the few moments he did in Goodfellas proved to me what an actor he was. He deserved a nomination for Supporting or Lead actor, and maybe even deserved a win. Paul Sorvino also gives an underrated performance as Paul Cicero, a quiet, calm and collected mob boss. He is the character who stuck in my mind the most after I watched the movie. He played the every day mob boss so well that I had never seen any other person play it like he had. I always thought of mob leaders as sinister and ready to kill at a moments notice, but not Paul Cicero. He had a silent persona, and whenever he did talk I felt I was hearing the leader of all leaders talk. The fact he did not talk much kept a sensation in me that he was a character who had gone through much in the past, and did not have much to say for he had already seen it all. A great performance definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination, it is sad he did not get one. The rest of the cast did great, everyone from Lorraine Bracco to Samuel L. Jackson. An intense, funny, romantic, dramatic and over well-rounded cast, it's the best representation of mob family and friends I've ever seen in film.\r\n\r\n   In total, Goodfellas is a strong and intriguing film. DeNiro and Pesci give excellent performances and belong to a great cast not many movies can beat. The plot lacks conflict a lot of the time and a clear representation of what the movie is about, but still includes many different themes that all work excellently well in one movie. The emotions were strong and the acting real, Goodfellas did a great job representing the mob in a more realistic than fully dramatic way. Martin Scorsese also directs solidly throughout the movie, and showcases his skill more than his style. A few times he went all Mean Streets and used music that became annoying, but other times his music worked well and was a joy to listen to while you watched the film. Scorsese finally does direction I can say I enjoyed, but writing this review I've realized Scorsese is not praised because everyone enjoys his direction, but rather the way he chooses to have different direction. Directors like Mike Nichols and Alan J. Pakula both have excellent, solid direction that I adore, but Scorsese rarely does what they do, and rather has direction that changes the film and the way people watch movies. It feels as if he does not know how to give solid direction, it's just he chooses not to and takes the different route to make a movie more memorable than others. I at last agree without Scorsese a lot of the movies we see today would not be how they are, for he influences movies with everyone of his films. He's a director all about not being contemporary, and while I do not enjoy the way he directs most of the time, I can honestly say I respect him. Like Tarantino or Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese has a vision that is different from other directors visions only because he wants it to be. I might not enjoy Scorsese, but I appreciate what he does for the cinema. Goodfellas is one of his least influenced films, but it still is a really good one that has made me want to go and re-watch some of his other films again and rather try not to enjoy the film but rather to understand why he did something a different way. Goodfellas is a landmark film when it comes to mob movies, influencing many movies and TV shows today, and one I'm glad Scorsese made. It is not an amazing film, but it is sure thing a great film, and is one that anyone who enjoys movies has to see. Thanks Scorsese. 8.5/10.\r\n\r\nAnd please, if you are interested in hearing my thoughts or listening me talk more about this film, check out my podcast!

As a teenager Henry Hill idolized the gangsters he watched in his neighborhood and it was only time he became one of them. Joining forces with Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito, Henry works his way up the ranks as they pull of various impressive robberies over time. But following the robbery to beat all robberies the glamorous life that Henry Hill and his wife Karen lead starts to tarnish as he gets into drug dealing and Jimmy and Tommy become more and more dangerous as they have their sights set on greatness within the family. Goodfellas is an epic movie spanning three decades as it covers the life of former American gangster Henry Hill adapting the story from Nicholas Pileggi's book \"Wiseguy\". In many ways Goodfellas is a movie of chapters as it covers the various parts of Hill's life starting with him as a teenager who idolized the mobsters that hung out on the street corners of his neighborhood. It's a wonderful opening building up this glamorized view of being a gangster as Henry watches them go about their business doing what they like with no cares in the world. And then getting drawn into the life as he worked at the Cab Stand run by one of the gangsters, learning how to score and make money here and there as he did more and more work for them. Goodfellas is a great gangster movie, a great movie in general. From the story line which covers the life of Henry, the action and drama which punctuates the story, the soundtrack and camera angles plus the direction and performances there is nothing to fault. And for a movie which comes in at nearly 2 and half hours packs a lot more in than you expect without feeling either rushed or padded out. But it is the fact that it is such a memorable movie for all the right reasons that it entertains from start to finish makes it one of the greatest gangster films of all time.",

I really love the feel of this film, it's just so good. I love the scenes where it shows one un-edited continuance shot following the characters (i.e. when they go into the restaraunt and when Hill hits the guy with the butt of his gun).

I couldn't have been more than 10 years old, and as such had the impression of \"cool!\", but nothing more. I recently purchased the blu ray and was really excited to watch it again, this time from a much more mature point of view. \n\nBeing a Scorsese film, and a masterpiece at that, the direction is a wonder. Typical Scorsese: Class, rawness and complex story delivered so simply it amazes me. That's in my opinion what makes Scorsese a master director and one of the best of all time.\n\nActing is superb the entire way around: The top three though are the show stealers. DeNiro is spectacular, as always. He is not front and center like he is in other Scorsese masterpieces of the past, but definitely when he is in frame it's De Niro for the win!\n\nJoe Pesci is at his best in this movie (along with Casino and My Uncle Vinnie in my opinion). He is so believably bad ass as a gangster, I have trouble seeing him doing anything else. His line: \"Am I a clown for your entertainment bit\" is classic.\n\nRay Liotta is not my favorite actor usually, but I can't deny he kills his role here. He is very believable and a great anti-hero. You sympathize and are disgusted by him all at the same time. He is a cheap gangster, but a real human simultaneously.\n\nThe music is great, the writing is nothing short of brilliant, and the story is just so good that there is very little not to like in GoodFellas. It makes it even more amazing to learn that this is a true story and these events actually happened in more or less the same manner!\n\nIn a nutshell, if you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and watch it. It's a little long (2.5 hours), but you'll barely feel it, plus it's worth the investment!",

            "content": "Review contains spoilers.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of hard to tell why this is the sixth Scorsese movie I've seen. Somehow, after seeing five other Scorsese movies before this, I had no idea what to expect going into this. I kind of expected it to be yet another Robert De Niro/Scorsese vehicle that gets a lot of praise. For some reason, they advertise the movie like it's very De Niro centered, but, in many ways, it's way more of a Ray Liotta movie before it's a De Niro movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie succeeds at some major things to carry the whole movie. It makes these gangsters who turn out pretty despicable very deep and relatable. The three leads are very deep and gain a lot of it near the end when shit hits the fan. Henry Hill, played by Liotta, has wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid. He was already a lot like one. He knows everyone and everyone knows him. He parks cars for people, he works for people and he knows what to do and when to do it. He starts getting involved with the underworld with people like James Conway, played by De Niro. He's actually a pretty nice gangster, until stuff gets really serious.\r\n\r\nHe gets along with Henry, gets him to know Tommy DeVito(later played by Joe Pesci), and gets him involved with things he never thought he would. Henry and James are easily the most sympathetic in the movie. Henry gets involved with gangster life almost unintentionally. He keeps meeting the right people at the right time and then ends up in gangster life. He doesn't just kill random people or do a bunch of drugs; he just gets caught up in this life by Paul who is his boss. He's never violent unless he needs to be. Someone hurts his girl? He beats them up. He's violent in all of the right ways.\r\n\r\nJames will give money to about anyone he cares about or is nice to him. He would give 100 dollars to the guy who opens the door for him. He cares about his friends. He is truly broken when Tommy dies. He isn't violent unless his friends are in trouble. If one of his friends do something stupid, he calls them out for it or scolds them. He's the one who has to clean up everyone elses problems, like say they start something and he has to end it.\r\n\r\nTommy is almost a psychopath. He's a very violent person. They're playing a game and he wants the drinks served faster so he shoots the guy in the foot. After they get his foot settled out, he shoots all of his ammo into him for no good reason. He'll attack the waiters at a bar because of his tab. He gets mad at one of his buddies for saying he's a funny guy. \r\n\r\nThese guys sound wooden and about one dimensional. The directing saves the movie. Scorsese's directing and the amazing cast is what saves the movie. It sucks you in and then you can't let go. The performances are just amazing and also suck you in. Unlike a lot of Scorsese movies, this movie leaves room for subtle comedy that really works. The violence serves the story and gives the characters an extra dimension. \r\n\r\nSorry if this is a shitty review. In my defense, this is a hard movie to review. \r\n\r\nI'll give Goodfellas a 9.9/10. I can never give a movie a full 10/10 because no movie is absolutely devoid of any plot holes or flaws. This movie flows a little too slow for the content it has to offer. Then again, I wouldn't really cut anything out except maybe the whole shooting Sam Jackson thing. It didn't really make much sense.",

De Niro adds a lot of goodness to every scene he's in instead of just being pushed aside as a side character, Pesci is very intense and you can't wait to see what this maniac does next, Liotta will have you on the edge of your seat just hoping that whatever trouble he's in, he can get out. It'll surprise you, it'll make you laugh, it'll show you what gangsters are all about. GoodFellas. Don't ever tell Pesci to go f*** himself.",

Ray Liotta gives a performance to remember. I have to say it's one of my favorite performances of all time. I can't give him enough credit for his role. De Niro & Pesci were nothing short of amazing as well. I can't forget Lorraine Bracco, she did a wonderful job as Henry Hill's wife.

Whilst not as sophisticated as The Godfather, it doesn't try to be. It's a more gritty portrayal of the Mafia and makes liberal use of bad language, violence and drugs to remind us of that.\n\nThis mobster drama has such an intriguing cast of characters and a story that's easy but fun to follow. Ray Liotta manages to create a character that we are simultaneously rooting for and against. Joe Pesci demonstrates his dramatic ability at its full potential with a performance that won him his first and only Academy Award. Bobby D does what he does best, gives us a character and just inserts him into the world and let's fate take its course.\n\nThis is definitely a film to see before you die and is something I'll never fail to recommend, whilst not as good as The Godfather, it certainly comes damn close and, in my opinion, exceeds Godfather Part II.",

            "content": "Alright. Now we're at movie review # 499 so let's review the movie everyone feels should've won best picture in 1990 instead of Dances With Wolves: Goodfellas.\n\nPlot: Henry Hill narrates the story of the film saying that he basically always wanted to be a gangster and thus always wanted to be a part of the Lucchese crime family. So he quits school and goes to work for them and eventually is taken under the wing of Paul \"Paulie\" Cicero and his associates Jimmy \"The Gent\" Conway and Tommy DeVito. The rest of the film goes through the rise of the Lucchese family and the experiences Henry has between his work, his associates and his life at home with his wife.\n\nNow one of the reasons I decided to finally fully see this movie is that I first saw a really good portion of it at film school and I was really hooked. But sadly I had to stop because I needed to get home, so I kept waiting for a good oppertunity to finally fully see it myself. But from how so many people felt about the movie, I felt I should've tried to stay just long enough for the end of the movie so I can give my honest two cents. The biggest thing everyone says about this movie as I just states in the beginning of this review is that everyone finds it to be a huge Oscar screw up for Goodfellas to be defeated by Dances With Wolves for best picture. Now as I've stated in my review for Dances With Wolves I have to admit that I can understand and can agree that it really just won because of the political statement that it made. And I still stand by it when I say that even if Goodfellas should've won, Dances With Wolves isn't the worst movie it could lose to. But for the most part I do agree with everyone else that it's Goodfellas who should've won. Rather then focus on the main leader of a crime family and his personal family like The Godfather movies, it focuses on just one of the wise guy members who just always wanted to be a gangster because of how you and just about do or be anything. People like Henry would have to rob or rough up people and deliver some goods, but that aside, they would just hang out and live like kings. And this film shows it all with its violence, language and...well just about anything you would expect from a gangster movie. And of coarse you have your memorable performances such as Ray Liotta as Henry, Robert DeNiro as Jimmy and more commonly praised, Joe Pesci as Tommy who won best supporting actor for his performance.\n\nAnd that's my review for Goodfellas. It's a great movie with a story that keeps you interested, with it's characters that were very well acted and give another violent yet fun take at the world of gangsters. If any film should've won best picture that year instead of Dances With Wolves, it's definitely this one.",

I liked the earlier parts of the movie that were about a young kid getting into the mob. It seems harmless at first, with narration that is unexpectedly optimistic and humorous. As the movie progresses the main character gradually becomes less and less likable, as his mob lifestyle proves to be destructive. The story spirals downward with the main character and becomes depressively downbeat. It still does a number of things right. The characters and their relations are extremely well developed and it is well shot. I do appreciate that the message is that crime does not pay and this kind of lifestyle will catch up and destroy anyone. What makes it a burden to sit through is that there is no one to root for; there are no good guys or redemption to be found. I understand that is the message and realism of the movie, but I just do not get into movies like this.",

            "content": "With the passing of the infamous mobster Henry Hill at the age of 69, (cancer not getting whacked) instead of posting another obituary I thought it would be appropriate to post my review of Goodfellas-which is based around his life. I had to write this for my film class a while ago and do a short analysis on it and I'm sure it'll say more about Henry Hill than a biographical summary could, so here it is.\n\nThere is good reason behind why Goodfellas (1991) is critically acclaimed as one of the best mob movies ever made. Granted Scorsese in top form directing a true-to-life mob film based on the book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family by Nicholas Pillegi. The book is based on the life of former Mafioso Henry Hill, Pillegi also co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese and both have a clear understanding of the mafia world and create an intriguing and uncomfortable film inside the heart of organized crime. The movie opens with a quick scene of brutal violence and is narrated in first person by Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) in a flashback of him at 11 years old. He is looking out of a window at the guys with expensive cars and the power they have in the city and says, \"as far as I can remember I wanted to be a gangster.\" That is what the movie sells the viewer on, the grandeur of the people that run the streets of New York. The movie takes the audience right into the \"family\" where Hill introduces many people along the way, the most important ones being Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro), Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) and the head of the ring Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino).\n\nWhat makes this movie so memorable is the fact that it doesn't glorify violence with loud shootouts but it works in slow paces of intensity that creep up in the shadows and make it clear early on that anybody can get whacked at any time. Joe Pesci in particular, portrays a loudmouthed, wild cannon that will protect his macho persona at all costs. He walks the line of funny and crazy in several scenes where the audience is confined wondering when his lighting fast temper will flare up again.\n\nThe film is also narrated by Hill's Jewish wife Karen played by Lorraine Bracco, which brings a female perspective that is often left out of these types of films. She explains how all of the mob wives look the same, talk the same and about the same things and she does not feel fully apart of the lifestyle Hill describes passionately, but she is still supportive. Scorsese shoots their struggle in this new life equally, especially when they start getting into cocaine dealing against the don's orders.\n\nScorsese captures the time period beautifully with popular music from the era and with shooting the grand opening scenes with POV shots and long pans making a regular entrance into a restaurant, an extravagent event where everyone is happy and everyone knows each other. The atmosphere is the plot of the movie as it follows 20 years of Hill's life, but the turning point is when Tommy viciously kills a made man, who is supposed to be untouchable. Everything goes downhill from here and there is a sharp contrast into the glamorous and harsh times of mafia life. At one point Hill even says, \"I was a part of something...I was living in a fantasy.\" \n\nThe film's tone changes from fantasy to reality many times but during the second act, Hill becomes a fixture of drugs and paranoia. One scene in particular when he is driving across town running errands Hill is scrambling with everything he needs to do and everywhere he goes he sees this helicopter overhead. Everyone tells him that he is just being paranoid, but the sense that it might be following him is there. Then the line between business, friendship and morality is crossed and once the conclusion is reached, Hill is left with a desire to relive those fantasies. \n\nThe film teaches lessons of the glorification of living a life of crime and how one can become alienated in being around that fantasy. The movie can also be shown in a film class for Scorsese's masterful direction that makes it clear why he is still one of the best filmmakers of recent history.",

I had just turned two years old when it was released on September 19th, 1990. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard about it over the years and now I have finally seen Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS and I enjoyed it. Based on a true story set between the 1950\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to the 1980\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Goodfellas tells the story of an Irish-American kid name Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who quits school and gets taken under the wing of the neighborhood mob capo Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) and fellow gangster associates:  Jimmy \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Gent\u00e2\u0080\u009d Conway (Robert De Niro) and the aggressive, hair-triggered Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) as they work their way up through the mob hierarchy for 25 years. I thought this was a very entertaining mob movie that Scorsese directed and I thought both Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci were more the lead stars than De Niro, whom to me thought he more of a supporting actor to the film. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird for me that Samuel L. Jackson, who was an unknown at the time, appeared in the film as Parnell Steven \u00e2\u0080\u009cStacks\u00e2\u0080\u009d Edwards. Just to point out, some of the actors: Lorraine Bracco (Karen Hill), Frank Vincent (Billy Batts), Michael Imperioli (Spider), Tony Sirico (Tony Stacks), and Vincent Pastore (Man with Coatrack) would all go on to star the acclaimed HBO TV Series THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007). I love the fact that Scorsese uses the famous song \u00e2\u0080\u009cLayla\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Derek and the Dominos for one of the key scenes of the film and used again in the end credits. My favorite line would have to be De Niro saying to Henry \u00e2\u0080\u009cNever rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This movie earned six Academy Award nominations: Scorsese for Best Director, Pesci for Best Supporting Actor, Bracco for Best Supporting Actress, Thelma Schoonmaker for Best Film Editing, and for Best Picture. Sadly it only won Pesci the Best Supporting Actor award. I would have to say that GOODFELLAS is one of the best gangster movies and one of Scorsese\u00e2\u0080\u0099 best films of all time.",

            "content": "Goodfellas- 9/10. \n\nNow Me Being an Avid Fan of Crime Themed Movies and Movies of Martin Scorsese, I was quite looking forward to watching Goodfellas after getting some really positive reviews about it, and it totally was as good as people speak of it. Making a mafia-based crime movie as it is a very tough job, but making a movie such original and realistic like Goodfellas( based on a true story) is an extremely impossible job, in which Scorsese has excelled. Goodfellas is vicious, hard-hitting, realstic movie about the dirty world of mafia and crime, and what happens when one goes too far in deep in the mafia business. Goodfellas is supported by the superb acting by the really talented and competent cast who all seem like gangsters, so they fit in their roles brilliantly, with a screenplay which consists of some brilliant dialogues and some perfect presentation of the what really goes on in the mafia business and the rise and fall of these dangerous mafia. Scorsese has made a gem in Goodfellas which is in my opinion the most realistic and original mafia based crime movie i've ever seen and one of the best crime based movies i've seen.\n\nThe Story which is based on true events occured in the USA, is taken from a novel written by Nicholas Pileggi, and its basically about what happens in the mafia world and how power, money and greed can often bait the people to do which gets them into a whole load of trouble. Its revolved around Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) who is the narrator and wanted to be a gangster from his childhood days, and his dreams come true through some help of James Conway(Robert De Niro) who raises himself and Tommy DeVito( Joe Pesci) to be his disciples in raising money through robbery rackets. One of these rackets ends them up in jail, and when they finally get out after some years, there lives change to a great extent and a lot of things occur in the following period. \n\nThe Acting by the whole ensemble cast was absolutely spot on, everyone doing their roles brilliantly regardless of how short or long their roles are. Ray Liotta was the main actor in this movie as the foxxy, greedy Henry Hill who is the narrator and his laugh in this movie is quite unique and disturbing at times, but his acting specially in the latter stages of the movie are quite brilliant and he narrated the story quite greatly as well, he had tough competition in De Niro and Pesci but he did a great job in convicing the audience with his performence. Robert De Niro excels whenever he is working with Martin Scorsese, so it's quite obvious that an actor of his class and nature is bound to do well in this kind of a role which suits him perfectly, and his acting in this movie almost makes the audience believe that it's not a movie but a documentary of sorts. Joe Pesci might not have much time as the audience liked in this movie, but honestly he did'nt need much more, because his portrayel of the vicious, sick, hot-headed Tommy DeVito is absolutely sublime and perfect for a man of his nature, he might be short and may not look intimidating, but his acting will be loved as well as loathed by the audience, in my opinion he did the best job among all actors in the movie. The Other Actors in the movie did their roles brilliantly as well, and i thought Lorraine Bracco did an especially splendid job as the eccentric, insecure wife of Henry and her acting throughout the movie being the only notable female character was brilliant. \n\nWell There is a reason Martin Scorsese is my favourite director, his movie's are never pointless and unrealistic, they may be violent and vulgur, sick and hard-hitting but at the end of it you'll wonder that what he wants to show is quite original and realistic as well. He makes another absolute gem in Goodfellas and his choosing and handling of his cast was so good, that I for one found it difficult to believe that i was watching a movie, they all looked and acted spot on as mafia men. His handling of Pesci and Liotta was truly brilliant, and his help and Pesci's brillance landed him an Oscar too. He utilized the screenplay(which is written by himself only) superbly as well and although most of the dialogues are vile and abusive they mostly make a point and keep the audience informed of what is going on in the film, he probably succesfully showed the audience what really goes on in the mafia world. His choice and usage of music as ever is amazing as he used so many different kinds of music in this movie that the scenes are never silent or dull and boring, you're always entertained. Scorsese has again made another gems in the form of Goodfellas which is one of the best crime-based movies of all time and will surely stay as my favourite director for a long time!\n\nThe Screenplay which is written by Scorsese himself has some of the most funniest, abusive, thought-provoking dialogues which are so brilliantly written, the script was shown brilliantly in the movie as well and the dialogues superbly delivered by the actors, especiallly Pesci, Liotta and De Niro. It is not an easy job to write a screen-play on this kind of a story, and considering that he also had to direct the movie, he deserves a lot of praise for writing such an original screenplay as well. \n\nThe Cinematography is quite great and convincing as well, as the mean streets of America are brilliantly presented and shown by Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus who deserves a round of applause for his contribution to the film which is very important as well. The Film Editing is quite brilliantly done as well because the scene's are edited superbly, and one can relate one scene to another and always stay informed of what is happening, and the film is not very lengthy as well, so editors James Y. Kwei and Thelma Schoonmaker deserve praise for their brilliant editing of the film as well. The Background Score is quite like any Scorsese movie, always pleasing the ear and never keeping the audience bored and the music director deserves a lot of praise for his brilliant job.\n\nNow, Goodfellas may be a crime movie but if one expects a fighting scene, or a chase scene, or a scene where a guy wipes out a gang with cool diving moves or something like that, please dont watch it for that. Goodfellas is quite original and realistic and quite informative of the mafia of the time shown, and the movie is presented amazing by the brilliant acting and dialogues by Pesci, Liotta, De Niro and co and the amazing presentation by the legendary Martin Scorsese who has made another gem which is bound to be seen for many generations to come to get some knowledge about what really goes on in the underworld, Goodfellas is one of the best crime-based movies i've ever seen.",

It's almost watching a lesson in how to be a professional criminal. Always keeping a realistic pace, and that little black humor that always Scorsese uses in his films, achieving the film both interesting and pure entertainment.\nThe entire cast does an excellent job, Robert De Niro despite not appear much, manages to be great; Ray Liotta is also excellent, but who gives a fantastic performance throughout the film is undoubtedly Joe Pesci.\nFrom beginning to end we see the Mafia as never before, while maintaining an impressive pace of entertainment, very well written and directed, \"GoodFellas\" is surely one of the best works of Scorsese to be remembered.",

It's excellent casting. \"Goodfellas\" also has some of the best and smartest uses of voice over narration I know of-- it's not just for delivering exposition, but smartly acts as an additional form of character insight.

Hill as a boy eagerly starts out his career by carrying out simple tasks such as parking and blowing up cars for a prospering Brooklyn crime family. Through his duties he meets his like-minded but psychotic partner in crime named Tommy (Joe Pesci), and a tough, successful superior, Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro). The trio then bribe, beat, and curse their way to success within the family, graduating to larger crimes including airport heists, unauthorized hits, and cocaine trafficking. These escapades don't go without notice or consequences, as Henry's struggling marital life hangs by a thread due to his unreported activities outside the house and disregard for his devoted wife, Karen, and Tommy's violent tendencies grow out of control and jeopardize the safety of the group and their operations around the country. Business is then temporarily put on hold when the key players in the family are sent to prison, including Henry and Jimmy. The gangsters are treated well though, in comparison to the other inmates, and they are released shortly, to see that business is going fairly well and normally. But things then spin out of control when Henry faces drug addiction and money is placed in the wrong hands. Throughout the course of the movie are fitting and flavorful songs picked from the 50's though the 70's that boost the tone and enliven the intricate world that is created in addition to powerful performances from the distinguished cast of character actors, many of whom played key roles in The Sopranos. Goodfellas paints a realistic and unrelenting portrayal of organized crime in the mafia that has a heavier tone than The Godfather, though they both depict fully realized central characters that are enduring and flawed, who through their decisions put their own and the people around them's lives at stake to protect the equally dangerous business they take part in.",

Everything from the writing, acting, directing, and visuals are all very good contributing factors in this masterpiece. Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, and Joe Pesci all give fantastic performances here and this film was a high point in all three of their careers. Joe Pesci really deserved his oscar that he got for this movie and I certainly thought the other two actors were oscar worthy as well. In my opinion, this film is probably Martin Scorsese's best film and this is certainly one of the best mob movies ever. Him and Nicolas Pileggi wrote such an amazing script that is full of fantastic dialogue and there were never ever any poorly written lines. Martin Scorsese has such a keen eye on both the story and plot because they were so intriguing and engrossing on screen. The characters were all interesting to watch from beginning to end and I actually cared about them. The visuals were grand and the film was shot very beautifully. Godfathers 1, 2, and this in my opinion, are as good as a mob or gangster movie could ever get. It is weird that this film only won one academy award. This film for sure is one of the most entertaining and rewatchable films of all time and it is one of my favorites.",

However, it is sufficient for what is presented. If you want blood in a Mob movie, I suggest the \"Godfather\" Trilogy. \r\n\r\nThe acting is pretty good, but nothing spectacular. Despite the great cast, none stand out and steal scenes -- however, Joe Pesci is pretty funny in a good number of scenes he's in. \r\n\r\nThe story itself is somewhat interesting. However, I was expecting a violent, crime-driven motion picture. \r\n\r\nThe directing was pretty good. But the director didn't set up any scenes where you were surprised when a gun was shot. I probably jumped once not expecting a shooting. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is not the Mob movie you are expecting, if you are looking for one like the \"Godfather\" Trilogy. It's more about one man's journey in and out of organized crime.",

When you follow characters such as these, people who deal in bootlegging, violence and crime daily, it's hard to be able to empathize or care about them because you don't want to associate yourself with these unsavoury characters. What \"GoodFellas\" does to get around this obstacle is follow a single character continuously from very early in his life. Once you realize how bad all of the people surrounding him are and how at any instant, for any reason he could be murdered and buried in a hole in the woods you care about him and start to really feel the tension that builds throughout the movie. \n\nMartin Scorsese really convincingly shows the intricacies of organized crime and by doing so, it doesn't feel like the picture is glorifying the lifestyle at all. The \"family\" the mob builds seems more like a cult, with only selected members able to advance because of their ancestry, friends and family members being excluded and replaced with other criminals and it's obvious that there is no real love between any of the people involved. They only see each other as means to an end. Many members are shown as reckless and violent while being terrified of each other. They're ready to jump at each other's throats like dogs the second anyone gives them a dirty look or provokes them. Meanwhile it convincingly shows you what the appeal of the lifestyle is and how people get seduced by the money despite all of the risks and danger involved. On top of all of the great drama and thrills playing out, the film is very well shot. There are long, uninterrupted shots through corridors and scenes that build suspense before an explosion of violence we know is only seconds away. It's also expertly acted, with dialogue that feels genuine and flows smoothly. Despite it's long running time \"GoodFellas\" never feels slow and even though it was released in 1990, it's still shocking and provocative. (theatrical version, February 5, 2013)",

Nicolas Pileggi's adaption of Henry Hill and his friends working their way up through the mob hierarchy is generally conceded as one of the best films of it's time. No other Scorsese, or mob movie have invented so many standards for a single film. Endlessly stylish, and compelling. Screenplay by Pileggi and the director. Brilliantly photographed by Michael Ballhaus. Pesci won Oscar.",

It is a glorious movie, from a glorious time. A phenomenal movie, trust me, I'm no clown. I'm a big boy,  I know what i'm talking about.

Damn good performances from everyone, and a decent, although not at all relatable, story. \nI was a little surprised by the violence, though. I wasn't expecting that. \nAnd then there's the utter repugnance of Joe Pesci's character. I didn't even like him in that \"bad guy\" sort of way. I was SO happy when he got whacked. Totally deserved it. \nI don't like that Henry Hill managed to skate away from all this just for ratting everyone out. He should just have served a few less years in prison. \nPlus, I don't buy for a second the accuracy of this movie pertaining to real events. I never believe any movie claiming to be \"based on a true story\". That's why I prefer to avoid them. I get distracted by thinking about what's really true and what's been Hollywoodized. \nAnyway.

Strangely after that I wanted to watch the movie over and over again, and I still often do, to the point where I say the lines along with the charcters as their saying them, and the film has many funny parts that, I have to wonder if Scorsese himself meant for it to be somewhat funny in a serious film.

I liked it, but it was very distracting because of all the dubbing that was done to hide the curse words. Eventually, I checked it out at Family Video, and I've been in love with it ever since. I now own it, and make it a point to watch it at least once every month. \n\nThe story is that of Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta) life, specifically from the 50's to the 80's. Everything about the mafia is included in detail in this film, including murder, robbery, extortion, violence in every sense of the word, drugs, and family. \n\nThe acting is excellent. Ray Liotta is very good in the lead role, and his equally good narration moves the plot along. Of course, the diamond mine in this film is Joe Pesci, who plays the psychopathic funny-guy who is very entertaining. THe way Pesci acts, you would think that his whole part is unscripted and that he is improvising. Robert De Niro is also very good as Jimmy Conway, the big shot in the mob. Also, Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Karen Hill, Henry's wife. I didn't think she would be believable as a mob wife after seeing her play a psychiatrist on The Sopranos for so long, but she is very good in the part. \n\nMartin Scorsese's directing is the best part of this film. There are many iconic and memorable shots in this film, including the tracking shot into the Copa. The way the movie flows along very quickly is entertaining, and never gets boring. Scorsese shoots the film in a fashion that it feels like the film trailer instead of the actual film because it is always moving and never lingers in one scene. There are numerous cuts that move the film right along, with the music accenting the flowing narrative. The music in the film is very exciting. The songs playing at any given moment always fit with the action going on, and give the movie a lighter feel to it. \n\nMany people say that The Godfather films are the best mafia movies in history. I would agree to that. They are the best ones, but I would rather watch Goodfellas. I enjoy The Godfather very much, but I have to be in a dark mood to watch it, where Goodfellas I can watch anytime and be very entertained and not bored. I would recommend this film to anybody, even non-gangster film fans because the film moves along so quickly that you don't even realize that it is over two hours long. I'm trying to thing of a negative criticism I could give on this film, but I am glad that I can not think of one.",

With these lines my eyes also, opened to just how powerful the storytelling in a movie can be.  Martin Scorsese's pure sense of style entices the viewer.  One scene, in the restaurant is possibly the most beautiful single cut scene in movie history.  Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, and Joe Pesci are fantastic.  It is rare that I feel so strongly about a movie, but GoodFellas is without a doubt a classic and it continues to entertain with each new watch.",

This motion picture is a stunning achievement, and one of Martin Scorsese very best movies. It has such great momentum, both dramatically and visually. The characters are top-notch cinema, interesting and flawed. In the end, Goodfellas is a true masterpiece, pure and simple.",
