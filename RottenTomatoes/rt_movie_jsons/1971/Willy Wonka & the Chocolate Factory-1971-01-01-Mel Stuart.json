            "content": "When Gene Wilder died there was quiet grief that shook fans everywhere. Willy Wonka is one of those legendary roles and Gene Wilder brought the character to life. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was released 52 years ago and hasn't aged a day. There's something primal about the story of Charlie Bucket going on the hero's journey. It's what Dan Harmon describes as \"an endlessly entertaining myth that's really just satisfying on the level of Jack and the Beanstalk or Ulysses fighting a cyclops.\" \n\nFor many of us kids, we loved Gene Wilder and his Wonka adventures since we were first able to love things. It's a fondness that runs deep. Wonka is a unique character. It's easy to relate to an underdog like Charlie but Wonka is who we want to be. Whatever his troubled past, Wonka made it to the other side. He's a self-made and successful business owner who runs a candy factory. \n\nHow does Wonka do it? Winkelmann says, \"How do fish swim? How do birds fly? They do it because they were born to do it. Just like Willy Wonka was born to be a candy man.\" That passion is contagious and admirable. Wonka is a big kid. He wears a purple coat, brown top hat, and large bow tie. He's often cynical and fights against his anger, but he's also optimistic, sentimental, and hopeful. He feels everything. He's broken but there's a humanity beneath the surface.\n\nWilly Wonka follows the Joseph Campbell myth. It's a traditional story that is well told and faithfully executed. Based on the 1964 book by Roald Dahl, Willy Wonka is thematically rich. Dahl is a legend for any anglophile. His work has been adapted by many filmmakers including Steven Spielberg. Dahl's life was plagued with joy and tragedy. Many of Dahl's characters are orphans and Charlie Bucket has no father or siblings. The character of Willy Wonka is based on Edward Cadbury of the Cadbury chocolate company. Cadbury produced everything from chocolate bars to the Turkish delight featured in The Chronicles of Narnia.\n\nWhen Dahl was a child in the 1920s, chocolate ceased to be a luxury product and became affordable to the working class. During the war, the British government encouraged chocolate production like the US government encouraged cheese. There was a lot available and everyone ate it. For Dahl, chocolate was escapism. Dahl's stories always had a combination of sorrow and joy, tragedy and triumph. But there was always a prevailing optimism and childlike wonder.\n\nWilly Wonka is about five kids who get a Golden Ticket and the chance to tour the chocolate factory. The tour is really a test as Wonka is looking for an apprentice to take over. All the kids have a fatal flaw or a bad habit. Augustus Gloop is a glutton, Veruca Salt is spoiled, Mike Teevee watches too much TV, and Violet Beauregarde chews gum. In addition, each kid is tempted by Slugworth to steal an Everlasting Gobstopper in exchange for money. But Charlie is pure of heart.\n\nWonka instructs, \"Now remember, no messing about. No touching, no tasting, no telling.\" If anyone disobeys the rules, he or she is disqualified from winning a lifetime supply of candy. These rules are impossible to keep and every kid falls short. No one deserves to win. But unlike the other kids who get eliminated by their own choices, it's Grandpa Joe who offers Charlie the Fizzy Lifting drink which causes him to break the rules. \n\nWonka sees this and lets it slide for the moment. Even the Tunnel of Terror is a test where the passengers are shown distributing images. Wonka wants to see who will crack first. Charlie and Grandpa Joe remain calm until Wonka starts his sadistic poem. Wonka makes every question a quiz, every choice a test. Charlie is judged in relation to the other kids and in the end, he is morally exceptional. \n\nUpset with Wonka's legalism, Grandpa Joe wants to give the gobstopper to Slugworth but Charlie refuses. There's a line Charlie won't cross. Charlie cares for Wonka like a child does a father. It seems to be destiny that the fatherless Charlie and the childless Wonka are brought together. Charlie has a Wonka size hole in his heart that can't be filled with money and moon pies. Wonka sees that Charlie was raised right and says that his entire family can move in with him. \n\nThe Oompa Loompas agree with the bad parent philosophy, \"Blaming the kids is a lie and a shame / You know exactly who's to blame? / The mother and the father.\" Charlie's surrogate family is made whole. Wonka is like Carnegie, Ford, and Gates. His factory is made possible through Capitalism. To paraphrase Wonka, \"If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it. Anything you want to do - do it.\" Wonka knows what he wants, goes after at, and lives are changed because of it. \n\nCharlie and his destitute family are pulled out of poverty by Wonka. And Charlie wasn't rewarded for free. He had to earn his place at the table or he wouldn't appreciate it. Early in the story, Charlie has a paper route. He's the only kid in the group that is seen working. He's also the most generous of the five kids. Charlie is anxious to share with others and kind to everyone.\n\nWilly Wonka rests of the very capable shoulders of Gene Wilder. He's a staple of childhood and an iconic performer. No one else could embody the zany, joyous, lunatic, but calculated energy like Wilder. The film just doesn't work without Gene. Director Mel Stuart is the cousin of Stan Lee so it's clear that Pure Imagination runs in the family. The collaboration of Wilder, Stuart, and Dahl is one for the books. \n\nThe music by Bricusse, Newley, and Scharf is some of best in film history. They are the music makers. They are the dreamers of dreams. Wonka the man has childhood hurts that need healing and his arrested development is relatable to a young audience. Nerdist writer Michael Walsh said it well, \"Willy Wonka didn't fail the world, it failed him. The world can seem dark and disappointing, but it isn't. There is always hope, a humanity that will overcome, and it was Gene Wilder who brought that to life.\"",

The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

Except for the first one, all the musical numbers are terrible; and except for the garbage one, no jokes are efficient. I liked Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, his character looks like a psychopath version of The Cat in the Hat. Surprisingly, the only of the five children who I could feel empathy for was Mike Teevee. I loved his innocence. Charlie's background isn't enough to make me feel for him (I don't know why, we just didn't hit it off); Veruca Salt is someone who I would use Mike's toy pistol, but with real bullets; Augustus Gloop appears in a very short time, and Violet Beauregarde is just obnoxious. The factory itself was also not that attractive. I felt like I was going to Disney world as a grown-up man who never grew up or developed a passion for Disney, I was a mere spectator (I was not immersed). About the epilogue, at the same time I liked the plot twist, the form that the message is passed seems forced. Also, the visual effects didn't age well. Anyway, I think my next review will be a good complement to this one. Now, let's travel 34 years forward.",

I had so many laughs throughout.  So many things in the movie don't make sense, but with a movie like this, I reckon it's not supposed to lol.  I am not sure how I feel about casting little people as Oompa Loompa's, I admit, but the use of just one 1 character for the Oompa Loompa's in the remake did not impress me.  Loved the computer readout scene, and many others.  Great movie!",

But the jokes are black and irrestibaly funny, with some lockable visuals and some really great Songs (which are mostly by Gene Wilder).

With this movie being made in the early 70's, it still holds up for the most part, almost grasping that classic title. Stuart & Dahl put a lot of heart into this film, giving the audience a pure, heartfelt message. The narrative is very creative & unique, while having some strange & over the top moments that were hit or miss. The first act made for a solid one, introducing these odd but fun characters, but it could've been cut down maybe by ten minutes, allowing the second act to have just that much more time to shine.\n\nThe cast of the fim put on great performances across the board, but Gene Wilder absolutely stole the show! This was such a trademark casting, where even the best actors today couldn't recapture his character. Peter Ostrum as Charlie did a very good job! He put on a great performance, where you really cared for him and his struggles from the first minute. Jack Albertson was another enjoyable addition to the film, adding great mature nature to the film, with an enjoyable hint of playfulness. The golden ticket finders and their parents all stood out in their own way, and were all around a load of fun. They're not characters you can really invest into, but they're great additions nevertheless.\n\nThe screenplay was real charming, with a sweet & sour twist to it. The production design was real colorful a beautifully crafted, along with a FANTASTIC & catchy soundtrack to fit this fun movie.\n\nOverall, this movie had some room for improvement, maybe not holding up the best after almost a whopping 50 years, but this is definitely something you need to see before you die !",

Stuart's craftsmanship is undeniable with clever shots of candy, faces, and eyes that convey a sense of wonder and expression. \n\nWilly Wonka is a hilarious satire on the depravity society undergoes for social acceptance and financial freedom. This film takes on class struggle, British education, media coverage, shoddy journalism, excessive capitalism, corrupt business practices, and above all, bad parenting. You will laugh at something new every year you go back and watch Willy Wonka.\n\nThere is even a few horror elements as these children and their chosen immediate family members undergo a haunted house disguised as a candy themed fun house. The children are competing for a lifetime supply of chocolate, so they are whittled down to one as they disappear. The boat sequence with spliced in edits of gruesome or creepy imagery is meant to unnerve you and scarred an entire generation of kids that watched Willy Wonka. Facing disappointment and defeat is another interesting lesson Willy Wonka teaches young Charlie, but thankfully he is such a sympathetic and selfless character he wins by virtue of his decency. Charlie has only ever cared for others and desired something of his own, thus Wonka finds him worthy to inherit his magnificent chocolate factory.\n\nThe family drama is heartwarming as we follow the likable lead from a desolate environment of abject poverty into a sustainable future of happiness and success. Charlie Bucket is wonderfully played by Peter Ostrum, who is the most pathetic and destitute Charlie Bucket imaginable. His misfortune is all brought on him by his low birth, but the reason you empathize and sympathize with him is that he'e righteous good, selfless care, and random luck personified. Ostrum captures a childlike wonder of the impossible and magic that enthralls you to the end of his sweet story.\n\nLikewise, Gene Wilder steals the show as the eccentric and entertaining candy inventor Willy Wonka! Wilder carries himself with a confident, likable grandeur and a charming facade for Willy Wonka to hypnotize you with constant wonders, misdirection, and advice. Wilder's singing during Willy Wonka's signature song \"Pure Imagination\" is iconic and lovely. His character clearly loathes the bad kids and desperately wants to find a pearl among the swines. Wilder's sly smile and quirky persona make for an unforgettable Willy Wonka like no other could ever replicate. Wilder's dramatic performance in Wonka's half office is gripping, scary, heartwarming, and life changing as he goes through so many emotions in the span of a few seconds. Gene Wilder was a gifted actor able to captivate you with his cunning dramatic skill and delight you with rousing charismatic comedy. \n\nWilder is funny giving cruel commentary as children are taken away by his wondrous little workers the Oompa Loompas. These little people are delightful with their luminescent green hair, dyed orange skin, white overalls, and goofy dances. I adore their parable songs that teach each lesson to the audience after each bad egg among the cast's batch gets theirs. They teach excellent lessons warning against indulging greed, consuming gluttony, being rude, watching too much television, and spoiling your children. Jack Albertson is fantastic as the morally curious Grandpa Joe character, who wants the best for his grandson Charlie. I really like Charlie's sad mother Diana Sowle, who is just trying to give Charlie a decent life through her clothes washing job.\n\nFurthermore, I like how Wonka's mystique is established early, so that you are curious about this hidden candy man shrouded in mystery and intrigue. Especially as you realize quickly, Wonka just wants to punish the wicked children for their bad morals, while rewarding the innocent and kindly chosen child. A sweet kid could surely be the only winner of a candy factory for Willy Wonka.\n\nAs for the bad children, the child cast is filled with apt casting of the most reprehensible and annoying deviants adolescence has ever conceived of on film. Julie Dawn Cole is the monstrous spoiled rich girl Veruca Salt. Her screaming, whining, and complaining is hilarious and fits her character perfectly. She is a great singer during her number in the golden goose room. Denise Nickerson is excellent as the constantly chewing Violet Beauregarde. She is annoying in her overly confident persona, which is perfect for this insistent child horror. Paris Themmen is crazy obnoxious as the know-it-all Mike Teavee, who worships the entertainment box too much. Michael Bollner plays the rotund glutton Augustus Gloop with a dour hunger for all sweets.\n\nFor me, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory will always remain a timeless classic for the cinema world that enchants with a vision of the world that can progress and change for the better. Remember to be yourself, be kind, and use your imagination!",

Featuring a room with a river full of thick, warm, melted chocolate and about every single candy you could imagine. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is about the genius, Willy Wonka reopening his mysterious chocolate factory. Wonka puts out 5 golden tickets in his chocolate bars in search for 5 lucky people, each person can bring along one guest. The 5 chosen ones get a lifetime supply of chocolate and a tour of Wonka's factory. Charlie Bucket, an adolescent who comes from a poor family dreams of getting one of the 5 golden tickets. Luck strikes him and he gets the last and final golden ticket. He picks Grandpa Joe as his guest. Once the tour begins, every child except for Charlie gets into unfortunate accidents and is forced to leave the tour. Charlie and Grandpa Joe sneaks out of the tour and drinks forbidden products without permission. Once the tour was over, Wonka ignores Charlie and soon tells him why: he drank forbidden product. Grandpa Joe insists on telling Arthur Slugworth the formula to the everlasting gobstopper, but Charlie returns it instead. Willy Wonka sees the kindness in Charlie's heart and Charlie's family lived happily ever after.\n\tI rate this movie 9/10 stars. I still vividly remember my reaction to the first time I saw this classic movie. It made me dream for days about Wonka's amazing room of imagination. The characters are all unique in their own ways and the creativity and plot of this movie are fantastic! I've never seen any movie like it before! They did make an updated version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but in my opinion, the original movie is better, other opinions may vary. I mean who doesn't like a movie about candy? Overall, I love this movie and I believe you will too!",

His energetic performance is by no means different from Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins. He absolutely deserved ,at least, an Oscar nomination. The movie lost some of its sharpness and suffered from some monotony after some time from reaching the factory. But besides the gorgeous production design and cool visuals, there was Wilder's charisma that helped to elevate the movie. The first half of the movie has great emotional value, and established the characters very well. Also, it feature some of the most beautiful songs of the movie. But due to the fast pacing, there was an action in the first half that felt forced, if it was necessary to serve a turning point of the story.\n\nThere are many powerful and very important messages in the movie. But the greatest thing about them is not actually the messages themselves, as we witnessed them delivered in a lot of movies before, but it's how genuine these messages seem as they are delivered in this particular story. Peter Ostrum is great in his first and ,unfortunately, his last role. There are many dramatic scenes that required a very good actor and he is. Actually, I didn't feel for even a moment that this is his acting debut. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a total blast from start to finish.\nIt's Scrumdiddlyumptious! \n\n(8.5/10)",

Such a simple yet deep concept is so pleasingly intriguing that one finds itself falling into the world half-way through the feature without even blinking. The passion and enthusiasm for such an eerie project is why it works for the most part of it while the rest is left upon its dark humour which may not be hilarious but certainly offers a chuckle every now and then. A gripping screenplay by Roald Dahl, himself who wrote the original book from which it is adapted, and Mel Stuart with his brilliant execution skills ups the ante and easily allows it to enter into the major league. On performance objective, Gene Wilder is stunning and satisfactory as usual and is supported by talented young actors and their humorous guardians. The first act is hilarious and exhilarating and longer than usual (which it doesn't seem so) after which it goes into dark place in its rest of the act but even that tone is so certifiably pleasing that no one minds it despite of being a feature primarily for children. Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory is a golden ticket for the ultimate cinematic experience where it doesn't bother to worry about its diplomacy and rather lets itself sink into its self-created poetic world.",

I've been checking out a lot of fan theories on Reddit lately. The songs are memorable with the Oompa Loompa songs and Wilder's \"Pure Imagination\" song being the best songs in the move IMO. Seeing all these fictional sweets being translated to a movie makes them look even more inviting and I think I'd go on the drug/hell boat tunnel ride because of my weakness which is anything similar to an amusement park. Thanks to its visuals that stand the test of time, great songs and Gene Wilder's captivating performance as the possible serial killer, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory remains a classic film adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved book.",

            "content": "I read the book (by Roald Dahl) to the kids and they were very taken by its wonders and its humour (and I hoped that its morality tale would sink in).  Therefore, I was curious to see how they felt about the movie version (the one from my childhood, not the later Johnny Depp remake) which I recalled fondly, despite some vivid early nightmares featuring Oompa Loompas.  I worried a bit that the movie's images might come to dominate what they saw with their own imaginations but it seems not to be the case -- the kids voted for the book over the movie.  But perhaps that is always what happens when you read a book first?  To recap, little Charlie Bucket longs for a golden ticket that will give him a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and a lifetime's supply of sweets - but there are only five such tickets in the world, hidden underneath the wrappers of Wonka chocolate bars.  Of course, after suspense is built, Charlie does find a ticket and he and his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) are taken on a magical and sometimes scary tour of the factory by Mr. Willy Wonka himself, played with a serene sense of perfect ambivalence by Gene Wilder.  Wilder is easily the best thing about the movie, giving exquisite line readings (whether absurd or menacing or bemused), although the various rooms in the factory do have a candy-coated funhouse charm to them.  Surprisingly, the film didn't seem childish or particularly dated, although the haze of nostalgia might be clouding my judgment.  I had forgotten however that this was a musical (apart from the scary songs sung by the Oompa Loompas after the bad children are dispatched with) and the various songs (including \"Candy Man\") work to bring out the fantasy elements of the film.   Of course, the book didn't have the songs and some of the episodes are different (squirrels not golden geese, for example).  Most significantly, Charlie and Grandpa Joe don't break the rules in the book.  However, this twist does add more suspense to the film than the book and gives Wilder a chance to turn Charlie's grim disappointment into ecstatic amazement, something that every child (and adult) deserves to feel at least once.",

Charlie Bucket, our protagonist, lives with his mother and 4 grandparents. They're very poor, and rely on Charlie's paper route money to get by. Which is why Charlie wants, more than anything, to win this contest. \n\nAnyone who's ever known they wanted something more than anyone else in the world can relate to Charlie's childlike desire to win Wonka's contest. It may seem frivolous, but that only highlights Charlie's desperation. He can only imagine luxurious things. And that ingenuous mindset is what just may give him what he needs.\n\nThe film enraptures you within the first 35 minutes, before we even get inside the magical factory. And once we're in, the film ascends to a whole new level. So full of unique ideas and concepts. Set pieces that made people depressed about the movie's fictionality long before Avatar's ever did.\n\nAnd Willy Wonka, himself, portrayed by Gene Wilder, is a marvel. No other man could have given us such a brilliant performance. He's sweet, he's creepy, he's sincere, and he's mischievous. Roald Dahl's original 1964 novel could be adapted for film one thousand times over, yet Wilder will always remain exclusively synonymous with the role.\n\nOh yeah, and the music is phenomenally perfect.\n\nFor being a \"flop\" from 1971, this film holds up better than most, if not all, of its contemporaries.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

Wilder plays the mysterious and genius candy maker Willy Wonka, who has become a recluse from society and hides inside his chocolate factory. Although he has long banned workers from going into and out of his factory, his delicious and creative chocolates as well as other exotic candies keep on coming out. As such, he and his candies have become stuff of legend. In the film, he has finally decided to reopen and allow outsiders to enter and tour his factory. The catch is that only five people and an accompanying guest will be allowed the great honor. In a brilliant method to randomly select those individuals, he has placed five Golden Tickets in five random candy bars. The lucky people that find the tickets will be granted entry into the factory and receive a lifetime supply of chocolate. The story follows the young and selfless Charlie Bucket who hopelessly dreams of defying the odds and finding one of the tickets. Of course, he does it and we follow him, four other children, and their adult chaperones as they explore the fantastic and surreal yet dangerous factory of Willy Wonka. Interestingly, the movie was a flop when it was first released in 1971. However, its popularity increased in the mid-1980s due to television broadcasts and home video sales. Retrospectively, it has become one of the most beloved children's movies and is critically acclaimed. I remember it fondly as part of my childhood. It is one of the few stories I remember vividly despite not having watched it in a very long time [until I watched it again after Wilder's death]. As a comparison, I had watched the remake, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) starring Johnny Deep as Willy Wonka, much more recently; I barely remember anything about it. For me and many fans, the original film is the official film adaptation and the only one we recognize. Although the book is focused on Charlie as the main character, Wilder's Willy Wonka is clearly the dominant character in the original film adaptation. As Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory became a cult film, Wilder's Willy Wonka became an iconic role that defines his career. It is a great children's movie because it challenges the limits of imagination with the impossible wonders inside Wonka's factory, encourages good behavior while strongly discourages poor vices for kids, and features memorable musical numbers. On the other hand, the film and especially Wonka also display some very dark, sadistic undertones that I did not really understand when I was younger. Now that I am an adult, the incredible contrasts make a look back at the movie extremely interesting.\n\nFor my full review, please go to http://rookerville.com/2016/09/02/retrospective-review-willy-wonka-the-chocolate-factory/",

Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

After recently watching it as an adult all I can say is this - my mind boggles at how so many people consider this to be not merely superior to Tim Burton's 2005 effort, but to be some sort of masterpiece.\nThe main thing I don't like about this 1971 movie is the underwhelming sets. The \"chocolate room\" just looks like somebody's slightly eccentric back garden, the \"golden goose room\" is just a pile of boxes and as for the \"inventing room\" it just looks like a total mess. I realize this movie is from 1971, but I love plenty of movies that have dated visuals.  Mel Stuart's \"Factory\" just looks plain uninspired - c'mon - a visit to this factory is supposed to be the experience of a lifetime, not a tour of someone's backyard shed.\nThen their is the sub-par child acting. This child acting is of the \"learn your lines well and recite enthusiastically!\" type rather than actually act variety. The kid who played Charlie quit trying to act and went on to become a successful  veterinarian: a smart career move since he can't hold a candle to Freddie Highmore. I will admit that Gene Wilder brought plenty of charisma to his role as Wonka which is what I'm giving one star for. Even so, I slightly prefer Johnny Depps's interpretation. I can actually buy Johnny as a person who's been shut away for 20 years with nobody but Oompa Loompas to talk to; Gene is just a bit too socially savvy. I also hate the bit where Gene randomly starts yelling at Charlie; so out of character.\nI understand that that a movie needs to change stuff from the book, but the changes the 2005 movie made at least had a logical point - giving Wonka a back story, for example helps to flesh out the character. But the changes this \"original\" movie makes add nothing to the storytelling and seem like just change for the sake of change. Making Charlie's dad dead, the Slugworth subplot, changing Charlie's personality into a poor version of Veruca Salt - WHY? This adds nothing.\n\nOverall I guess I'm just confused as to why this movie which is mediocre-poor in my opinion is so well loved. I guess nostalgia is a powerful drug for some.",

            "content": "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of the strangest amalgamations of genres, and by all rights it really shouldn't work. You would expect that mashing together a story from a children's book, a musical, a number of very dark (even scary) elements, and a comedy would result in a movie that no one could like. Yet somehow it defies expectations and is actually a triumph. There are a lot of reasons for that, and it starts with the magical casting of Gene Wilder. He, in his own natural talent, is able to blend together all those different styles within his characterization of Willy Wonka. He seems silly, insane, caring, and crazy all at the same time. It's hard to explain just how perfect he is for the role, but if you merely watch the boat scene and then the scene immediately following you'll get the idea of what I mean. Somehow he is able to be the most frightening and intimidating man for a minute and mere seconds later he transitions to laughing and joking without batting an eye. I can genuinely sense why Charlie is connecting with him, and also why the other kids are somewhat repulsed by him. Jack Albertson is also a nice choice as Charlie's grandpa, because he clearly loves Charlie to death, but he has a bit of crazy in him as well. As a result, Grandpa Joe is almost the connecting point to help us see how Charlie can like Willy Wonka. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, including an entire collection of surprisingly good child actors, but I think Willy Wonka and Grandpa Joe are the 2 linchpins that make this movie function.\n\nThe music is extremely catchy, and I often find myself humming the tunes for hours after watching Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. However what is most interesting to me is how dark and even disturbing this film can be. As a child I was always conflicted about Willy Wonka because I loved the fun parts, but it was kind of scary (and I've always been a wimp about scary movies.) However, this movie has just the right balance of creepy moments to almost make it an entry film for young kids into the horror genre. In many ways Willy Wonka comes off as a serial killer slowly picking off children one-by-one throughout his factory. Of course all my focus has been on the factory, and I've failed to mention one of the most interesting sections of the film, which is the opening act. It actually takes quite a while before we ever meet Willy Wonka, because the setup of the story is not short. It takes some time to explain about the Golden Tickets and to build up the anticipation of Charlie getting one. Ordinarily this might be a boring section of the film, but they blend in a bit of comedy that always makes me laugh a lot. My favorite moments come from David Battley as Charlie's goofy teacher, Mr. Turkentine. All in all, this strange brew of different genres defies all expectations and becomes something truly magical. It still holds up to this day, and I'm glad the movie-makers were daring enough to put something as unusual as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory into theaters.",

The songs are catchy and memorable, and it's really funny, especially from Willy Wonka. He can also be very strange which makes little kids scared, but also happy at the same time.

I know that sounds like a pretty deep interpretation, but I found it hard to not come to that conclusion. Besides, the story and characters are so entertaining and immersive that I can easily lose myself in the setting, and this I feel is what a great movie should do. The overall style very whimsical and enchanting, with some zany and colourful visuals, coupled with genuinely amazing special effects. All that is great, but what cements this movie is the performance of every character, and should also mention the musical numbers. Not only are they short and sweet, but unlike most musical numbers, they're actually entertaining. In fact, the musical numbers are some of the best parts of this movie.

The movie is directed by Mel Staurt and was release back in 1971 so it is a classic and filmed in Technicolor.The entire movie most of the color were muted except the color red a few other color but mostly bright red (Charlie's sweater).\nNot only the characters and the wonderful props but the\u00c2\u00a0original musical score brings another aspect to this magical movie. Composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley it was nominated for Best Orginal Score back in 1972. It is indeed a musical with catchy musical numbers and inspiring songs with a message behind it. Starting with the opening credit to the ending credit an instrumental of Pure Imagination sets the tone.\n\u00c2\u00a0 There are some dark tone like the how world obsession with chocolate early on (Wonkamania)and the tunnel scene which Gene Wilder did a great performance that people on the set though he went crazy by being in the tunnel. It seems that Willy Wonka planned on getting rid of the kids throughout the film\u00c2\u00a0 and what really happen to the kids when they disappeared? Overall a musical about imagination and inspiration with a little bit of insanity making it worth watching many times.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory shows a possibility of joy for a poor boy. So what happen to the boy who suddenly got everything he alway wanted? He lived happily ever after. Take the main lyrics and apply it to life. \"We are the music maker and we are the dreamers of dream\".",

The film boasts a strong sense of visuals, which are impressive for its time, and it also adds so much to the film's atmosphere. If you want a standout fantasy picture, then this is a perfect film to watch.

Apart from the fact the film has somewhat differed with the novel in notable areas, what does it matter, when Gene Wilder, and the five main children in the movie, all manage to make the movie more enjoyable, along with a wonderful performance from Jack Albertson? The visuals may be more inferior when you compare it to the remake, but it was made in the early 70's and had virtually little to work with at the time. And it was a film that I remember well in my childhood. Sure it doesn't have the same feeling as it first had when I first watched it, but please DO NOT pass on this film. Even share the film to your children if you have any.",
