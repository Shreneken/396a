The first is that it is among the best of Eastwood's acting career.    The second is that is among the first films where a serial killer is the villain.   That would definitely change over the course of the next two decades.   It also is one that was made for Richard Nixon's \"silent majority\" of people who were tired of a lot of the counter-culture society was experienced.   Some have called the film racist. Others have called it fascist.   I don't see those things in the film-not to say you might not see them in characters in the film, but not the film itself.   Andrew Robinson is great as the villain.  This is one that has changed over time but is actually still worth watching.",

The acting is also great, in his more complex roles Clint Eastwood was born for the role of Dirty Harry, and all the supporting roles are very well played. All in all, brilliant and one of the crime thrillers there is. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Dirty Harry Callahan wages a battle against a murderous and brutal hippie-like all-around scumbag who menaces the general public.\n\nYes, both movies are period pieces. \"Billy Jack\" was meant to show the peaceful hippies being helpless against redneck bullies. \"Dirty Harry\" shows that the counterculture was no benign force, with drug use, sexual diseases and unwanted pregnancies, and violent crime including terrorism rising sharply by the 1970's. The police forces were viewed as helpless, and the movie depicts this view, with Dirty Harry as the hero who fights back against all the evils. Yes, the characters are one-dimensional and the story is trite, but the movie effectively conveys the message it intends to.",

            "content": "When a deranged sniper picks victims at random and personally taunts the San Francisco police department, he draws the ire of the grumpiest cop on the force. Harry Callahan, played with typical take-no-prisoners panache by Clint Eastwood, isn't here to make friends or to feel good about himself. He exists solely to conduct court on the streets, rulebook be damned; to shoot first and ask questions later. Presumably because the weapon he carries, an iconic, big-barreled Smith & Wesson, doesn't leave enough of its target to raise any objections. \n\nAlthough everyone clearly despises him on a personal level, it's hard to see Harry positioned as anything but the banner-waving antihero: he gets to spout the sweet quotes, wear the cool sunglasses and strike a bunch of badass poses, so his opinions become the film's opinions. That's a problem when the themes grow more ambitious, addressing the shaky ground between what's legal and what's arbitrarily \"right.\" Harry sees everything in stark black-and-white, flying into a seething rage when a high-profile collar walks free due to his own brutish interrogation tactics, and we're meant to cheer when he stalks and eventually forces a second confrontation with the freed criminal. The pursuit itself makes for gripping entertainment - messy, gritty and intense - but the overt political messaging makes it more complicated than a simple yay-rah get-the-bad-guy.\n\nThe film uses its antagonist, the aforementioned sniper, as incendiary proof of the holes in the justice system. If more situations were handled outside the courtroom, I guess, we'd see far fewer hijacked school buses or tortured kids. Odd that the fallacy of this argument is lost on Harry, who's earlier beaten to a bloody pulp by three yokels. Believing what they see, and refusing to wait for the whole story, they jump to conclusions and take him for a peeping Tom. Harry licks his wounds and carries on, blissfully unaware of the poetic irony.\n\nThis isn't just your basic gunsmoke action movie. I might not agree with its conclusions, but I appreciate the debate it inspired within me. It's always good to test one's own beliefs. Also good to soak up a healthy dose of raw '70s atmosphere from time to time, which is something Dirty Harry has in spades.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's San Francisco police detective is the original cop-who-plays-by-his-own-rules. Tasked with hunting down a Zodiac Killer-like of villain, played exceptionally well by a very creepy Andrew Robinson, Eastwood's Harry Callahan ignores the rules in order to get the job done. Rewatching the film, it holds up as a tight piece of storytelling, as you would expect from veteran Hollywood director Don Siegel (\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" \"Riot in Cell Block 11\" \"The Big Steal\" \"Coogan's Bluff\" \"Escape from Alcatraz\"). What's hard for me to know is how this film would be received by someone watching it now for the first time, because \"Dirty Harry\" has been endlessly imitated over the years, having been the originator of innumerable action film tropes (cop as anti-hero, the veteran cop saddled with unwanted college-boy partner, telling his superiors \"you can have my badge,\" big exotic guns, \"What about the rights of that little girl?\", the DA having to release a suspect over illegally obtained evidence, a young cop barfing at the sight of a dead body, not to mention the film's finale, and many, many more), as well as featuring a wildly politically incorrect hero. I'd think that the film would still work for modern audiences in terms of pacing, storytelling, and suspense. Eastwood commands the screen and is supremely charismatic in this iconic role. There are so many classic moments in the film, from the oft quoted bank robbery scene, which was ghost written by the great John Milius (\"Conan the Barbarian\" \"Red Dawn\" \"The Wind and the Lion\"):\n\n\"I know what you're thinking, punk. You're thinking 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and will blow your head clean off, you've gotta ask yourself a question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?\"\n\nThe scene works even better with Harry's nonchalance to the chaos around him is wonderfully accented by his casually finishing off his hot dog while shooting bank robbers. Later in the film there's the wild scene at the cross when Harry is supposed to give Scorpio a ransom payoff, but ends up stabbing him in the leg, with a crazy cut to Robinson's bizarre and primal scream. There's also the memorable football stadium sequence, where Lalo Schiffrin's excellent score perfectly compliments this shockingly tough sequence. What doesn't age as well is Harry's overt racism and disregard for basic civil rights. It's debatable if a character like Archie Bunker would work today, but the Noble-Bigot-with-a-Badge does not work nearly as well in today's political climate. I considered including a quote from the film as an example, but the racist quips are insidious in how deceitfully charming they come off. In the film's defense, director Siegel has gone on record as saying, \"I was telling the story of a hard-nosed cop and a dangerous killer. What my liberal friends did not grasp was that the cop is almost as evil, in his way, as the sniper.\" Although that may have been true for this picture, it's not as much in the subsequent Dirty Harry films, where he is very much the hero (although the second film had somewhat of a rebuttal to these criticisms by making the villains vigilante cops Harry had to go up against). Also in the film's defense, Eastwood himself made something of a spiritual sequel to the Dirty Harry films with \"Gran Torino,\" in which he played a similar bigoted character, a Korean War veteran who catches his Hmong American neighbor boy trying to steal his car, but subsequently developed a relationship with the boy and his family. Torino could easily have become another powerful white man saves the day type of story, but it's instead more of a meditation on the brand of macho hero (and often racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.) which Eastwood helped to create. Still, \"Dirty Harry\" could never be made today and I think Eli Roth's remake of \"Death Wish\" is evidence of how this type of film just no longer works and in some ways is like trying to bring back minstrel shows. Still, taken as an artifact of its time and in terms on cinematic style and charismatic characters, \"Dirty Harry\" remains an iconic although admittedly politically dubious film.",

The feature may be of \"cat and mouse\" nature but its simple chess politics that it plays with all tricks in, is what makes it smarter and cunning than the usual cop cases. \n\nIf it is brimmed with action then it is full of slick moves, if it has any chase or physical sequences it is performed with panache and if there are any morale conflicts or threats they are projected with gut wrenching execution that screams the glorifying cinematic experience that every fan aspires for. The background score is palpable enough to add the cynicism on each sequences, the cinematography is decent with sharp sound effects and fine editing but poor art designing. \n\nThe way it simplifies the human necessities and emotional aspects by choking up the characters' nerves and narrowing its abilities is how it offer a three dimensional perspective to them which is purely cathartic to the eyes. Eastwood is lethal and also vulnerable and with a character range that he has offered he milks out the essential bits and foliates it through finesse on screen. The narration is appreciative and thoroughly gripping but with Siegel's brilliant execution it creates the anticipated impact on screen. \n\nThe smarter ideologies of the crimes are written with maturity and depicts the entire subjective procedure to the viewers to elaborate the bar and the magnitude of the stakes and emotions that the characters are going through it. Thoroughly competent action and chase sequences, gripping and layered screenplay that enfolds with appealing characters and revealing concepts are the high points of the feature. \n\nDirty Harry is undeniably dirty but it is aptly humane and sane whose buoyant natured script is the real gem that keeps giving it back.",

Things just happen and we are allowed to jump on board and learn about the characters as the story moves along. It is easy to connect with the plot because we can quickly hate the killer, and youÂ’ll recognize all the cops based on common stereotypes we know from other movies. I like the interaction of the characters and how straightforward the case is handled. In many ways, if you take out some of HarryÂ’s extreme measures, this felt like the way an actual police investigation might be handled.\n\nI cannot fathom why Clint Eastwood is so charming as Dirty Harry. He has such a gruff and unapproachable demeanor, and he doesnÂ’t talk a whole lot. Yet thereÂ’s something about him that makes me care about the character and want to see him succeed. ItÂ’s the kind of performance that could seriously turn me off if done by the wrong actor, but Eastwood has what it takes. I also thought Andy Robinson was great as the Scorpio killer. He has such an oily and unpleasant demeanor, so you instantly hate him. The rest of the cops fit their stereotypes, and John Vernon delivers a familiar performance as the Mayor. I was happy with all the acting in the movie.\n\nThe story is one that goes through a number of ups and downs. There were moments when I was extremely locked in and following every step the characters took, and there were other times when I was approaching boredom because I knew they werenÂ’t going to find anything. Perhaps the predictable nature of the plot was what was bugging me in those scenes. ItÂ’s not 100% rote, because I didnÂ’t know exactly where each scene was headed, but there were certainly moments that I could predict with ease. The conclusion was ridiculously satisfying, so it kind of covered up for any problems I might have had, and the iconic line (while a bit long) was delivered so well it had the desired impact even though IÂ’ve heard it dozens of times before.",

When the city is threatened by a sniper aka Scorpio Killer (Andrew Robinson) who keeps putting down random victims holds the city police for ransom to stop his rampage. Harry is assigned for the task and they come up with a plan. The sniper gives them a slip after repeated plans lure him to their cage. This time the Scorpio killer takes it personal and asks Harry to deliver the ransom for a final showdown. \n\nFollows a textbook story telling process which later becomes a formula for the genre. A detailed introduction of the antagonist followed by the protagonist only after which the plot surfaces (as wafer thin as it might be) slowly building up to a final showdown. Though the Scorpio killer initially comes off as weak and mad, his character progresses steadily during the course of the story giving multiple dimensions and levels to his character. It is not comprehensible how the police department misses the sniper even multiple sightings with all the man power, pre-planning and technology. But the star is undoubtedly Clint Eastwood who carries the entire weight of the movie and even gives it a considerable boost with an uninterested look on his face, the hype surrounding him because of his volatile trigger happy nature and sharp one-liners. \n\nSimple yet captivating screenplay allows Clint Eastwood to drive the star vehicle",

The film also boasts a soundtrack composed by Lalo Schifrin better known for composing the TV theme for Mission Impossible.\nThe plot concerns a mad man serial killer called Scorpio who terrorises the city with ransom demands and ever more elaborate murders.\nThe city mayor not wanting more bloodbaths seems intent on meeting the killers increasing financial demands whilst Callahan believes he needs stopping using his more direct methods shall we say that fly against the 'left wing' civil liberties of the American constitution.\nEastwood directs some scenes himself in a sign of what direction (pardon the pun) his later film career will take perhaps.\nI was amused with the 1971 environment. For example Scorpio at first demands the 'massive' sum of $100,000!\nThe cars look massive almost as bushy as Eastwoods hairstyle.\nI sometimes wonder if a more right wing method of law enforcement would lower the crime rate (minus blowing people's heads off of course!)\nThat reminds me. The film is best known for one of Callahans phrases that he uses twice in this film.\nThe \"Do you feel lucky, punk\" speech. Actually Callahan is armed with a .44 Magnum firearm. The most powerful hangun in the world at the time.\nIt apparently could blow your head clean off. If faced with its barrel pointing at you, you've got to ask yourself one question surely. It fires six bullets. In all the excitement of a 1970s shooutout. You wonder if five or six shots have been fired. 'Do I feel lucky? Well, do you punk?'",

You might find yourself laughing out loud at what one character describes as Harry's \"cro-magnon\" utterances but, like Heston and Reagan, Eastwood and Siegel are dyed in the wool conservatives and they backed it up off stage to prove it. Eastwood would eventually use his stardom to make a successful  bid for  Republican mayor of Carmel, CA.\nWhat makes this movie #3 is the annoying murderer that Harry seeks to bring to justice. I guess Seigel made him so annoying so that the audience would be gratified when Harry shoots him, but he was so annoying I hoped he wasn't even in the movie to begin with. Which is impossible to hope for seeing as the die of the movie had already been cast.\nOther detractions from cinematic bliss: a bad script because it is very choppy.",

In Dirty Harry both the good guy and bad guy are imperfect. Both seem to stumble through the conflict. The sniper stumbles through the action scenes, while Harry stumbles because of his responsibilities as a police officer. \n\nThe film begins in typical fashion with a sniper on a roof. His second attempt he gets spotted by a helicopter. That's when we know we're not in for a connect-the-dots kind of cop drama. The crime spree ends before it begins, and the rest of the movie is about what other action movies would sum up in the last 10 minutes. The villain is shamelessly wicked and very unusual. At times it has the atmosphere and musical score of a sleazy early 80's slasher movie. \n\nHarry is imperfect because he's an old school kind of cop with old school methods and he has a dark sense of humor that comes off as politically incorrect to people who don't him. Catching the criminal isn't the problem. The problem is bringing him to justice within the limitations of the law. Harry allows the black man at the beginning to be \"lucky\" because Harry knows the justice system will take care of him, but with the sniper justice isn't guaranteed. The word \"lucky\" is so significant because through the whole movie that's what the sniper used as a weapon. Luck saved him from harry each time. Luck got him off the hook because of a technicality. But ultimately, the snipers luck had no power over Dirty Harry Callahan.",

            "content": "\"You know, you're crazy if you think you've heard the last of this guy. He's gonna kill again,\" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) sighs to his superior.  A maniac (a fantastic Andrew Robinson) is on the loose, killing anybody who comes to his liking, usually on the edges of rooftops with a polished sniper rifle.  His wild, long blond hair blows in the wind with the prowess of a lion ready for an attack, his deranged face snarling with noxious elation.  He is the Scorpio, a murderer who finds himself amused when blood spills onto his hands.  Callahan has done everything to stop him, yet he has escaped the grip of authority with aggravating repetition.\n\tUnfortunately for the so-called Scorpio, Callahan is no Frank Bullitt and is definitely not a Jacques Clouseau-type.  Carrying a .44 magnum, which he dubs \"the most powerful gun in the world,\" Callahan is unflinchingly acerbic, humorless, and unafraid to sidestep the law and take justice into his own hands.\n\tWhen \"Dirty Harry\" was released in 1971, it was a new kind of cop movie.  It was one with an outrageous amount of violence and one with a lack of a moral compass.  Simply put, it was a source of serious controversy.  Police brutality was something left untouched by most American films, and to have a hero slightly deranged himself was something far and away from the well-defined good guy/bad guy clichÃ©.  But to take \"Dirty Harry\" seriously would be like viewing a comic book with a realistic lens; it's a piece of seedy pulp that takes the police thriller genre and stretches it out with operatic carnage and dark alley sleaziness.  \n\tThe streets of San Francisco are like the frames of a graphic novel, colored with dim electric light by night and saturated with disconcerting warmth by day.  The film lives in a world where crime runs around with menace, becoming nearly casual to its citizens.  Harry Callahan is like Batman, minus the suit, Batmobile, immortal sidekick, and underground lair.  \nHe is most well-defined in an early scene where he sits down in a diner for a midday snack.  That moment of peace, though, is interrupted when he notices a bank robbery in progress across the street.  A few of the criminals have been gunned down, but one lies on the steps of the entrance, bleeding and moaning.  Rather than arrest him, Callahan is inspired to taunt him, make him transform from predator to prey in a matter of seconds.  He deadpans his way through a mini-speech that seems prewritten as he cocks his gun: \"I know what you're thinking. 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world.  It would blow you head clean off.  You've gotta ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?'\" We discover that the thief is lucky - Callahan has fired all six shots.\nBut it becomes clear later on that he most likely already knew that all six shots were fired.  When it comes to a dirty criminal, however, why not play a sick game of Russian Roulette?  Callahan would prefer to teach brutal lessons and give bad guys a taste of their own medicine; Miranda rights and the amendments are for sissies.\nHarry Callahan was the original tough-guy detective, remaining to be a brute force of fortitude and pointed courage.  Without Eastwood, he wouldn't have that ominous edge by his side.  It's a performance of precise emotion.  He delivers every line with a diverting softly spoken voice, only to later explode with an awesome capability for violence.  As he whispers his few words, we can only wonder what's going on in his head.  Callahan is such a legendary figure in cinema because every move he makes is recognizable, embedded into the foreboding underbellies of neo-noir.  \"Dirty Harry\" is iconic for a reason: few cop movies have been able to thrill without the slight glitter of Hollywood lure.  It can be sickeningly violent, but that's only because one foot is glued on action and the other is on realism.",

But while the ideology of the \"Dirty Harry\" universe is an unintentional charicature, the movie is undoubtedly well-made and well-acted.  Andrew G. Robinson is playing society's stereotype of a serial killer, but he's doing it marvelously.  Clint Eastwood isn't working outside his comfort zone, but like John Wayne or Arnold Schwarzenegger, he doesn't need to.  \"Dirty Harry\" follows in the footsteps of hard-boiled detective movies of Hollywood's yesteryear, and points the way to future buddy-cop potboilers.

Clint Eastwood's performance here as Harry Callahan, an inspector, is just as cool as his the Man With No Name role in the Dollars trilogy, and Clint Eastwood is the epitome of cool. He's a reason to see this movie alone, but of course, there's tons of other stuff that make this such a great movie. \n\nThe story is about an inspector named Harry Callahan who's assigned to hunt down a psycho serial killer named Scorpio. Everything is so well handled, and takes a simple idea and expands on it with an incredible amount of tension, as well as great acting, especially by Clint Eastwood who made himself and his role an icon, and by Andy Robinson as Scorpio who completely nails the role as a madman serial killer. Don Siegel offers a dark and brutal view of crime in San Francisco, with an intimidating and frightening Scorpio. It's tightly paced with tons of memorable scenes and lines, and even some fairly messed up stuff as well.\n\n It was even considered controversial due to its \"fascist\" message that many viewers interpreted the movie to convey. I can see why some people wouldn't appreciate this film because of the message, which in a way defies the law and builds on the fact about how Harry takes matters into his own hands. I, however, was not bothered by its message. The magnum speech by Harry is awesome and never gets old, and the influence this movie had on the thriller genre of movies was huge, spawning not only four more movies in the \"Dirty Harry\" series, but modern thrillers can be traced back to this movie. It's a classic in every way, and not only remains one of the defining films of the 70s, but its influence is clear in modern day movies as well.",

            "content": "This is the iconic Dirty Harry?  The movie is a blatant, unsophisticated polemic that positions one-dimensional characters (better said, cariacatures) on collusion course against the backdrop of a wildly improbable and contrived plot; sanctimonious police brutality is exonerated by the brusque dismissal of inconvenient civil liberties.  Famous lines are are hurried and delivered with none of the stylized gusto with which they are frequently quoted.\n\nDevelopment of the Scorpio's motive is so completely evaded that it can only be purposeful.  His character is a hodge-podge, a composite of American discontents, exhibiting alternating flashes of racial hatred, misogyny and militant atheism.  He even manages to pair an outsized sense of entitlement regarding government services owed to him with an extreme, paranoid distrust of that same government.  He's an all-purpose, wild-eyed malcontent; a bad egg who faults society for his shortcomings.  \n\nSure, some empathy-obcessed liberals with PhDs are likely enough to countenance this view, retroactively indulging his crimes with hamfisted motives.  But any level-headed person knows the real problem is his failure to take responsibility for himself. \n\nWriting the whole thing off as a poorly conceived vehicle for delivering the apologist case for strong-armed, objectivist authoritarianism to the movie-going public is tempting, but that risks implying more clarity of purpose than warranted.  The viewer, it seems clear, is faced with ploddingly stupid DE-lusion, as opposed to intentional manipulation characteristic of closely related and potentially malicious, IL-lusion.  Such treatment would also ignore the stubborn resonance Inspector Callahan continues to enjoy. \n\nContext is important, one polemic follows another and the pendulum has a well-known penchant for hyberbole.  Viewed as a backlash reaction against the movement to extend civic liberties to vast, disenfrancised segments of the population, which had come to dominate the public discourse over the previous decade, Dirty Harry no longer seems quite as out-of-step with reality.  Fitting then, that a clean-cut, well-dressed (for the 70s, I can only infer) principled cop should be the only thing standing between San Francisco, the capital of all things hippie, and self-suffication by the hands of destructive, over-tolerance.  It seems that Hollywood was as in tune with the demands of 'silent majority' social conservatives as Richard Nixon.  \n\nWith this in mind, the viewer is compelled to revisit a recurring theme (simultaneously the movie's sole brush with cleverness): repeated questions to the origins of Harry's \"Dirty\" sobriquet.  Though multiple explanations are mooted by various events and characters, including Callahan's own musings, the real explanation would be easier missed if fired from a .44 magnum.\n\nHarry isn't dirty.  In fact, he's a model policeman.  He has an unshakeable moral compass and, most importantly, repeatedly demonstrates that the duty to protect is one and the same with his identity.  One might be forgiven for confusing the official police officer oath as Inspector Callahan's personal profile.\n\nWhat makes him dirty is moral erosion masquerading as progress.  He's a stalwart bastion of 1950's values trapped amidst the stagnant destitution of the 1970s, owing to the self-indulgent and ideological snafu inscribed on the interceding period.  The two-fold pinch of escalating violence-- the kind that requires carrying a .44 magnum  as a sidearm-- and the encroachment of legal constraints conspire to tie his hands, constraining the good inspector's ability to perform his duties.  By the climax, his room for manuever is so diminished that he actually must break the law to carry out his protective duties effectively.  In this contorted maze of contradictory incentives, turning in his badge is the only morally upstanding course of action that remains open to him. \n\nMaybe Galt's Gulch, Ayn Rand's unfortunately-named objectivist utopia in Atlas Shrugged, that libertarian bible, to which the world's precious few productive members withdraw in an epic outpouring of sullen poutiness, is looking for a sheriff.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie clearly had a profound influence on the Diehard trilogy (only the first three deserve acknowledgement as serious films), so it's not all sobs and rough-hewn, man-crush throbs for put-upon feeling white males.",

Though the Scorpio killer initially comes off as weak and mad, his character progresses steadily during the course of the story giving multiple dimensions and levels to his character. It is not comprehensible how the police department misses the sniper even multiple sightings with all the man power, pre-planning and technology. But the star is undoubtedly Clint Eastwood who carries the entire weight of the movie and even gives it a considerable boost with an uninterested look on his face, the hype surrounding him because of his volatile trigger happy nature and sharp one-liners. \r\n\r\nSimple yet captivating screenplay allows Clint Eastwood to drive the star vehicle",

            "content": "I've always wondered why critics focused on the supposed political message this film is said to have had four decades ago. By focusing on the film's moral position, I think the critics of their time forgot that films are as much art as they are entertainment, and this film excels both on the level of art and entertainment. The film portrays a detective trying to apprehend a vicious psychopath, while grappling with the orders of his superiors contradicting his own moral instincts. To Dirty Harry, the criminal is as clear as day, but what enrages him is that law is too slow to act. He represents society's latent desire for swift and effective justice without any interference from a middle man. In the dazed and confused time that was the early 1970's, he was essentially a kind of modern cowboy, the ultimate antithesis of what John Wayne came to represent. We can his politics all we want, but he certainly gets the job done, and I actually admire him as a character because of it. In the film, Clint Eastwood delivers what is perhaps the kind of tense performance and implicitly tough persona that distinguishes him as a great actor. The film also manages to realize its seedy setting effortlessly, the end result being a visual representation of what was then the present. Of course, nothing steals the spotlight quite like the raw violence that speaks louder than the film's eponymous protagonist, and it can't be denied that it's always a pleasure to see Clint Eastwood do what he does best. Whether you loved it for its uncompromising attitude, or hated it for its supposed politics, this film will always leave an impression on you in some way or another, and it will most likely be among the most truly raw of cinematic experiences.",

Well, do ya, punk!?\"\n\nWho in Earth hasn't heard these words. That was the line that led me to many Clint Eastwood's classics, from the times he didn't contribute intellectually to his creations but rather showed off as a competent American action \"hero\" the massess could identify with. First with Sergio Leone's masterful trilogy of \"The Man With No Name\", where a rather amazing amount of substance is complemented by the brilliant Lee Van Kleef, and more recently on what is arguably his most known work: a fascist cop that goes by the nickname of \"Dirty Harry\". \n\nThe problem of this film is structuraly its simplicity. I could not believe any single thing any of the characters were saying, almost as if the actors were being forced into a ridiculous plotline with absolutely no free will. That's the problem of the right-wing and its fantasies: it doesn't succeed on understanding society or the world, for that matter, in any important terms rather than its own terms, which usually make things puerile. \n\nI frankly don't understand what makes Clint Eastwood's icon a hero... he states obvious nationalism... he could even wear a Nazi uniform and go on unnoticed. In one scene he expressess his etnics concerns to a Mexican cop, argumenting that \"not trusting foreigners\" was one of his virtues. What is that supposed to mean? Is that truly a hero? In an era so overwhelmed by the Cold War and the idiotic massess seeking safety in undermined concepts, there are certain films from the time that captured mankind's hypocresy on a spectacular way. There you have \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"A Clockwork Orange\", two masterpieces of American filmmaking. But remember who were those characters and what they did. Peter Sellers played a series of bizarre and insane personas, product of monumental events that shaped the world through the 20th Century. Then was Alex DeLarge, a psycopathic criminal who as a victim of totalitarianism was forced to become a sin machine meant for practical purposes. But then, who is Dirty Harry exactly? An intolerant 19th Century fetishist whose greater skill lies in the use of a Magnum gun and complete disregarding for human life? How is that supposed to be a hero, anyway? Is that the person who is going to protect the identity of the State, rather than destroy it? \n\nThe film even mocks classical laws principles, in favor of vigilantism and illegitimate killing as a form of justice. So, after all, we realize that the great \"American hero\" is only that idiotizing product whose only reliable force is the use of a bigger gun. No wonder there are people like James Holmes in the streets!",

Clint Eastwood era giÃ  un'icona hoolywoodiana grazie alla saga spaghetti-western di Leone, ma in quest'occasione prendeva i panni di un'antieroe dai modi barbari ed un tantino altezzosi, tutt'altro che determinati da un qualsiasi zampillo di moralismo; armato con una potentissima 44 magnum, pronta a mettere KO qualsiasi fuorilegge che gli ostacolasse la strada, l'ispettore Callaghan, piÃ¹ noto come \"lo sporco Herry\", per via dell'ambiguitÃ  del suo modus operandi e l'aggressivitÃ  ostinata con cui si scaglia sui nemici, figurÃ² la sagoma perfetta del piedipiatti scaltro e solitario. Il cattivo della vicenda, un'inquietante Andy Robinson, Ã¨ in perfetta antinomia con questo personaggio, sia per la brutalitÃ  dei suoi crimini, sia per la caparbietÃ  nel mettere a punto i suoi folli e feroci misfatti. Il film perÃ² non si limita solo proporre un esemplare tratteggiamento dei ruoli, ma riesce ad offrire un perfetto modello strutturale il quale evidenzi come una solida e cruenta trama principale possa essere composta da alcuni sotto-episodi che pervengano a ritmarla al fine di dare un giusto equilibrio tra le scene piÃ¹ sanguinose e quelle pervase da un sottile strato leggerezza e nera autoironia: una serie di versatili tonalitÃ  costitutive in grado di smaltire una storia che, senza queste proprietÃ , risulterebbe forse troppo cupa ed irrigidita.

            "content": "Review Number: 1\r\n\r\nDirty Harry - The classic that spawned off a whole generation of similar-type movies, but always remained in a league of its own. \r\n\r\nDon Siegel's \"Dirty Harry\" was arguably the start of the serial killer/cop genre inherent in so many mainstream American movies released today. Setting the stage for countless rip-offs and sequels, \"Dirty Harry\" was one of the true first of its kind--not only in regards to its genre influence but also in terms of its content. (Full frontal nudity, heavy vigilante-style violence and strong language.) It is, in fact, one of the quintessential 1970s films--capturing the very essence of the typical gritty '70s film style we're all familiar with. \r\n\r\nIt is an excellent police thriller about a serial killer who can only be brought to book by a police officer who is prepared to bend the rules a little. As well as being an exciting and suspenseful story in itself, there is an interesting - and unresolved - subtext about whether the end justifies the means (the film, long before any sequels were envisioned, ends with Harry's vigilante-style policing administering the roughest of justice to killer Scorpio, but then throwing his police shield away in disgust at how impotent due process leaves authority against such people). \r\n\r\nHarry is a paradox. In one sense, he is an 'outlaw'. He has little respect for formal authority (in the opening minutes, we see him being rude to the mayor) and he carries a strictly non-regulation monster of a gun. Harry is openly racist and mutinous. And yet he is also deeply moral. He conforms to an unarticulated ethical code that is anglosaxon American. He protects the weak and confronts the wrongdoers, no matter how the odds are stacked against him. Arguably, it was this characterisation that made Eastwood a megastar.\r\n\r\nThere are some illogicalities about the plot. Such an important event as the cash drop is left to two cops working alone, when in reality there would be a massive covert operation. When Scorpio beats the rap, there is no public outcry or media storm, and he is allowed to get on with his anonymous existence virtually untroubled.\r\n\r\nAt the time of its release, \"Dirty Harry\" was seen to be very much in touch with the mood of the general public who had seen an obvious increase in violent crime accompanied by an apparent inability on the part of the law enforcement agencies to deal with the problem effectively. This left many people feeling vulnerable and let down by the system that was supposed to be there to protect them. The analysis of the problem as expounded by Harry Callahan was that the justice system had become too soft on criminals, criminals' rights had been given greater importance than those of the victims and the lawyers who represented suspected criminals were simply hell bent on obstructing the police in their work.\r\n\r\nDirty Harry is a classic of in every way, shape, form, and one of the most influential works in the genre. Great action magnificently directed by Don Siegel, the master of the genre, great dialogue, and relentless tension make this the ultimate detective thriller and one of the defining films of the 1970s.",

The film is perfectly paced and the finale is suspenseful.  It also laid the foundation for virtually every cop drama that came after it.",
