Because of tradition of course \nTopol stars as milkman Tevye in the beloved musical by Tom Abbot focusing on a village of people who follow Judaism \nA wedding is taking place but cut short by occupiers in Czar Russia \nProducer and director Norman Jewison reminds its audience that the most important aspect of a film is its inherent humanity, and a director exists to serve and foster that, not necessarily their own bravado-fueled compositions\nUltimately the musical is about a group of people stuck on the precipice between tradition and change\nSome of these changes are happily, if difficultly discovered, social progressions and expansions of restrictive mores about wealth, love, and the patriarchy\nSome of these changes are brutally foisted upon them\nThis is a 3 hour journey yet many musicals in the future could be heavily inspired to use unique techniques like this film does \nIt is very sentimental in a theatrical way, romantic in the old-fashioned way, nostalgic of immigration days, and very affirmative of human decency, loyalty, bravery and folk humor\nMusical fans will love it 50 years since it's release even if it loses a lot of it flair from the original source material",

His choices, his thoughts and his emotions we see and sympathize with, to the goal to better understand such social problems as antisemitism or even communism. And with such heavy burden of socio-philosophical themes, \"Fiddler on the roof\" still manages to be very entertaining musical, and one constructed in such a way that it can be greatly enjoyed even by the audience that has no interest in things like class warfare or what have you. Really admirable, if you ask me.",

It also scores points for having a simple yet well-told story and being incredibly funny, thanks to Topol's performance ranging from calm & sincere, serious but firm and gloriously hammy.

            "content": "I was shocked by the fact that I enjoyed this film when considering the fact that I have a real antipathy for musicals, particularly those released in the 1970s such as Cabaret (1972) and All That Jazz (1979). While this film still had many of the issues of the genre in that it was over long and thin on plot the songs were catchy, the performances were spirited and the characters were genuinely charming as they went about their lives in a ridiculously thin plot. Modern audiences may not flock to lengthy musicals the way they did in the 1960s and 1970s but this is one that has actually held up to modern scrutiny and has the power to entertain.\n\nIn the early 1900s Jewish patriarch Tevye, Chaim Topol, leads his poor family in the small town of Anatevka, Ukraine where tradition is valued above all else. His primary concern is marrying off his three adult daughters to suitors deemed acceptable by matchmaker Yente, Molly Picon, as he contends with his overbearing wife Golde, Norma Crane. Eldest daughter Tzeitel, Rosalind Harris, is in love with poor tailor Motel Kamzoil, Leonard Frey, which means that her father has to break off a planned engagement to the older Lazar Wolf, Paul Mann. His second daughter Hodel, Michele Marsh, falls in love with Communist Perchik, Paul Michael Glaser, whose lack of financial stability leaves her parents concerned. His third daughter Chava, Neva Small, commits the ultimate sin by wanting to marry gentile Fyedka, Raymond Lovelock. This proves to be the last straw for her father but as anti-Semitic tensions brew in the background he may have bigger problems to face than just the marriages of his daughters.\n\nWhat differentiates the film from other musicals is that it actually allows for dialogue and plot in between songs and puts the dance numbers to good use when they do pop up now and then. Sure some of the songs seem a little repetitive but who isn't charmed by \"If I Were a Rich Man\" and \"Do You Love Me?\" as testaments to the power of a strong hook. I was initially concerned by the lack of real choreography during the song and dance numbers as Tevye is largely confined to kicking up his legs and presenting his jazz hands upward but Jerome Robbins later proves to have a few more tricks up his sleeve. By the time we reach the big group dance numbers, most notably that which occurs at Tzeitel's wedding, you really feel the exuberance of the highly complex dance numbers and director Norman Jewison's frenzied camerawork captures all of the movement well.\n\nFurthermore the plot was actually involving as while you could argue that it is repetitive as we see the same thing occur not one, not two but three times as Roger Ebert did but there is a joy in seeing love triumph above all else. Each of the three couples have their own unique charm as while we only get to see a few scenes of each couple interacting the young actors portray their characters sweetly and with simple evocation that is rare in modern acting. Why complain when what we get is so enjoyable? I am always a fan of simplistic love stories and while I have seen each of the three conflicts played out in other, better films there was enough here with Topol's big, emotional performance to keep me engaged. You know that each of these women will end up with the man they love but there is some interest in seeing how their relationships with their parents are different. By all accounts the film adheres pretty closely to the hit stage play and is all the better for it because although the film's scope is expanded and we feel as though we are watching more than just a filmed stage play it retains the liveliness of a live performance.\n\n1971 produced an incredibly strong Best Picture lineup and this was among the top quality productions that was honored as while it doesn't reach the heights of The Last Picture Show (1971) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) it is still oddly terrific. To my mind this is overlooked by contemporary viewers and deserves more appreciation.",

I were a wealthy MAAAAAN?! \ud83c\udfb6\n\nTevye is a farmer and milkman with a wife and 5 daughters living in a Jewish village in Russia in 1905.  Tevye's just trying to get by each day when suddenly 3 of his daughters decide they want to get married.  And...... well, that's the whole plot basically.\n\nI thought this movie was excellent!\n\nI knew 2 songs, only heard one of them completely and had no idea what kind of movie this would be.  I wondered if it would be cornball and tough to take seriously or conversely too serious with no element of fun.\n\nTurns out... it's a beautiful mix of comedy and drama.  A musical dramedy!\n\nI'll get right to the best thing in the movie and that's Topol as Tevye.  Tevye looks about 65 but Topol was only 36 when he made this movie, that alone makes it a great performance.  It's like Russell Crowe playing a much older man in The Insider.  But Christ almighty is he good in this movie.  He's from Palestine, he couldn't even speak English the first time he went up for playing Tevye on the stage and you'd never know it in this.\n\nHe's gotta be funny, serious.... AND sing!  And Topol can manage all 3.  \n\nTevye in this movie is one of my new favorite protagonists in movies, it's impossible not to like this guy and relate to him just wanting things to go as smooth as possible in his life... and of course they DON'T!\n\nTevye is constantly talking to God in this movie... and singing to him of course.  Sometimes in the middle of a conversation, he'll look to the heavens to keep God in the mix and EVERY aside like that was a 10 out of 10 moment.  It's ALMOST like breaking the 4th wall but not really and it works beautifully.  He doesn't even have to SAY anything he'll just be talking to someone and then look at the sky as if to say \"Can you believe this bullshit?\"  He's like the original Deadpool!  Ya know if.... Deadpool was an elderly Jewish milkman in turn of the century Russia.\n\nNow I love Gene Hackman in The French Connection...... but I might have voted for Topol to win the Oscar he was nominated for instead.\n\nNorma Crane plays his wife Golde and I was shocked how good SHE was in this movie!  I'd never seen her before and it's probably because she died shortly after making this movie at the age of 44, such a shame.  But she's outstanding here as Golde who's tough as hell very much runs the house and she doesn't take any shit.... but you can tell she and Tevye love each other.... I know they do, they have a whole song about how much they still love each other than made me well up with tears for the one time in the movie.\n\nMy favorite scene is one with the two of them.  Where Tevye has to figure out a way to tell Golde that their daughter's arranged marriage is off.... and it's this entire musical number in a dream scene where Tevye concocts this horseshit story that Golde's relatives came to him in a dream to tell him she shouldn't marry this butcher in town.  And the butcher's widow shows up as a shrieking banshee to further warn against this and it's a FANTASTIC scene!\n\nNobody in the cast is bad, a 70s Hollywood musical and nobody drops the ball.... that's a lucky break, man.  Always seems to be one person in every musical where it's like \"OK... they don't belong.\"  But nope, everything's great in this.\n\nThen there's the music.  If you don't come out of this movie whistling the tune of \"If I Were a Rich Man...\" then you weren't listening.  What a great and catchy score, adapted from the play into a film by... John Williams who won an Oscar for the music in this movie.\n\nNorman Jewison directed the movie and he hasn't made a movie I haven't liked yet with In the Heat of the Night, Moonstruck and now this.  When they're not singing this is a proper drama with a great naturalistic tone.  It's a rare musical where you could take the songs out and it'd STILL be a great movie, probably.\n\nThe Oscar winning cinematography by Oswald Morris is GORGEOUS!  That shot where we get the credits playing over... the fiddler on the roof playing as the sun is setting... now THAT is a perfect shot.  There's a lot of shots like that in the movie, I couldn't get over how good this movie looks.\n\n3 hours long is a bit much, but it's one of those movies where even if I think it's too long... I wouldn't wanna cut anything out, it's too good.\n\nI loved Fiddler on the Roof, such a good movie.",

It chronicles a Jewish family in the Ukraine from the early 1900's. I love how Jewison films Tevye's monologues to himself and the audience. The endlessly crafty cinematography, epic sweeping panning shots, complexly choreographed dance sequences, and tender acting performances all come together nicely in Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nNot to mention, this is a musical! The music is memorable and funny, while also conveying the sincere emotions and deeply held beliefs of these people. It harkens back to traditional Jewish values and melodies. I love the score and the singing alike. I think most audiences will at least enjoy the songs scattered throughout Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nAbove all, I must credit Topol. He is an incredible actor who carries the majority of the film. Fiddler on the Roof is told right alongside him. We get his thoughts, feelings, and perspectives on every issue and moment. He conveys strict Jewish tradition, while also desiring to change for modern times. Topol's performance is one for the ages as he captures the harshness necessary for the desperate times, while simultaneously depicting a tender and understanding father. You feel and empathize for his cause. Topol makes you laugh and sing, but you truly come to understand and respect him as a man. This is complex characterization at its finest. Topol should be proud of his magnificent contribution to cinematic excellence and Jewish history.\n\nIn short, Fiddler on the Roof is a timeless classic. Both beautiful and enjoyable as a musical as well as demonstrating Jewison's mastery of filmmaking. Fiddler on the Roof is a movie you must watch before you die, not because you are told to, but rather because it is so engaging and important. Enjoy!",

Topol's understated performance is in direct contrast to Mostel, whose over-the-top antics worked best on stage.

About a Jewish patriarch who must deal with his daughters' ideas of marriage, this tale is at turns lively, intelligent, thoughtful, funny, and, finally, heartbreaking.  Chaim Topol, recreating his role from the London cast, provides a charismatic, energetic performance as the lead character Tevye, an initially proud father figure whose pride gradually goes to pieces as he is forced to bend over backwards for the sake of his children's happiness, and deals with the czarists who threaten to drive the whole Jewish race out of his hometown of Anatevka.  All this is interspersed by buoyant and emotionally charged musical numbers which breathe just as much heart and soul into an already compelling piece of drama.  Norman Jewison does an excellent job of transitioning the stage play into a full length movie; the cinematography especially brings out the rustic tones of Anatevka and the Russian setting.  The only minor criticisms one might have is that the film is quite long, clocking in at slightly over three hours and some dance sequences do feel stretched out, but on the other hand, it's hard to imagine this film without them.  All in all, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is both a classic musical and an equally fantastic movie that treats its source material with the love and care it deserves.  I highly recommend it, especially for fans of great singing, dancing, and tragedy.",

Their motivations, their comforts and desire for change in some respects, are what takes the forefront in both the stage show and the film. The music is just as rousing as ever, having stood the test of time at this point and becoming a musical theater staple. I also can't praise Topol enough. He, in my eye, will always be the ideal Tevye on stage and screen. It's a sentimental, rousing, yet sometimes quaint look at a village on the edge of change.",

Sure it stands for old fashion values and traditional family life but Topol is magnificent and manages to stay incredibly lovable even when he loses his temper. The rest of the cast is amazingly good and each of the characters feel true to his/her convictions. The cinematography, the score, the sets, the costumes, everything here is perfectly crafted to offer one of these monumental entertainment for the whole family.

Yet possibly the greatest is the directional work of Norman Jewison who combined all these into making Fiddler on the Roof an incredible visual and auditory experience which captures the spirit of the original play, the educational culture of its story and the powerful entertainment value that it holds. His direction is just utterly some of his true best and he exercises a true understanding of importance within Jewish culture as the director of Fiddler on the Roof.\nThe story\nYou can tell that the Fiddler on the Roof script clearly doesn't deviate far from its theatrical roots because it clearly has many of the charming anecdotes written for a stage production and all of the clever and charming jokes and friendly characters that would have made the original play so widely successful. It's so charmingly written and so cleverly humourous in such a quirky way, and the characters are all interesting which makes it easy to connect to them and hope for their best. And all this combined makes it a powerful experience in entertainment because when a viewer genuinely cares for the characters it makes it a stronger and more beneficial experience to them, as was the case with me watching Fiddler in the Roof.\nAnd the story is a fascinating one. Like I said, it explores the complicated culture of the time of 1905 and the context of a Jewish community living within Tsarist Russia, and the trouble that comes with it. The tale starts so spirited and energetic which fills audiences with glee and life so that they feel what it is to be a Fiddler on the Roof, and it later is struck down by the drama of the film so the depressing atmosphere of the story is reflected in the depressing feeling the viewer gets as he or she experiences the sadness of what it is to be a poor Jewish person in Tsarist Russia. So Fiddler on the Roof is both happy and joyful while also sad and depressing, and it's an emotional roller coaster. And definitely a good one, because a musical that can touch you like Fiddler on the Roof and make you feel as much as it did is worth watching and learning from. It explores what it is to have optimism and suddenly be faced with shocking nihilism, so it's a powerhouse dramatic film. Yet even as it does this it exits on a high note, a beautiful one which may have viewers smiling like it did for me. Really, the story in Fiddler on the Roof is one deserving of immense praise for its themes and development.\nThe production design in Fiddler on the Roof is greatly convincing since the town of Anatevka and the people within it feel genuine, and of course the costumes make them feel more humane as characters which makes them easier to connect to. All the sights in Fiddler on the Roof are beautiful so it's a strongly appealing visual experience. The cinematography is excellent too, and the film is edited in perfect timing for the musical scenes especially so that it's basically a magical musical.\nAnd the musical score in Fiddler on the Roof is absolutely hypnotic. Its beautifully written, composed with skill and sung with the voice of true magicians of theatrics. It's incredibly beautiful, and the voice talents of its cast are just perfect. But their acting talents managed to match that.\n\nChaim Topol has the vocal talent of a an old wise man whose voice itself had grown a beard. His Israeli accent and low tone of voice is so energetic and charming that it sucks the viewer into loving Tevye the Milkman in every situation. See, Chaim Topol has an unmatchable theatrical energy in him and such a friendly smile which made him shine as he danced during his solo performance of \"If I Was a Rich Man\". His performance is some of the most spirited and strongly dramatic in musical cinema history, and Chaim Topol proves that he was born to play Tevye in an deservingly Academy Award nominated performance. \nLeonard Frey also managed to make a memorable supporting role since he had a real passion in him which showed off in his chemistry with Chaim Topol and Rosalind Harris, and he really has a sense of love in him for Tzeitel which makes it a thoroughly combining emotional performance which ensures that the love in the story is just refreshing. He is a memorable face from Fiddler on the Roof.\nRosalind Harris was also terrific because she captured the innocent spirit of Tzeitel very well and sung majestically which made her an appealing presence to the eyes and the ears.\nNorma Crane was also a powerful addition to the cast, as was Paul Mann.\nMichael Glaser was also great.\nReally, the entire cast was strong and energetic without one actor ever slipping up.\n\nSo although the latter part of the film is less energetic and a little slower than the former, Fiddler on the Roof is an exceptional film adaptation of a classical play which educates and entertains while it mesmerises viewers with its",

As he puts it, 'blessed' with five daughters and a poor living condition, he delivers the milk around his traditional jewish village Anatevka, friendly with all the locals who share each others' tales. When he is asked by the butcher for his blessing to marry his eldest daughter Tzeitel, this begins a whirlwind of events for Tevye, including a poor tailor in love with Tzeitel, his second daughter leaving home to marry a poor revolutionist, his third daughter marrying a russian, therefore disowned, and the russian forcing the whole town of Anatevka to leave and find somewhere else to live. \r\n\r\nMany supporting characters are involved to support jokes and scenes in their own ways, including the classic beggarman, the old matchmaker woman Yante, the aggravated butcher Lazar Wolf, the Rabbi, the Constable and Golde, Tevye's wife, who all provide character development for Tevye, and challenge his beliefs and needs throughout.\r\n\r\nIn a touching finale, we see how the events of the past effect on the future, when the town is forced the evacuate by the Russians, and Tevye's family is split apart due to travelling plans and emotional trouble, which prompts saddened singing and unenthusiastic dancing. All of which is intended of course.\r\n\r\nHugely ejoyable, great singing, great acting and great cast. The songs are fantastic, especially emotionally-charged 'Sunrise, Sunset'.",

Something along those lines is probably what would be thrown in this film, because if this film is phenomenal in no other regard, then it is phenomenally Jewish. Well, in all fairness, it is Yiddish, and there doesn't appear to be a way to not make something Yiddish really, really Jewish, though it certainly doesn't help that this film is directed and produced by a guy named, of all things, Norman [u]Jew[/u]ison; and the best part is that this dude's not even Jewish. Shoot, no wonder he did \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" right after this; he was getting confused as a Jew enough without this film under his belt. Actually, considering that this film is also a musical, I don't think that \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" so much inspired people to think that Jewison isn't Jewish, as much as it inspired people to think that Jewison was doing some kind of religious musical trilogy, which is probably why \"Rollerball\" was a bit of a disappointment, because Jewison went way off from the original play and didn't have anyone bust out into a song about Hinduism while playing a violent futuristic sport in which they skate or motorcylce around with spiked armor while throwing steel balls around. I can think of plenty of people who would say that if \"Rollerball\" really was based off of a Hindu musical, and faithfully, then it still wouldn't have been as stupid as the 2002 remake. Speaking of going off topic, it's time we cut back to talking about the film I'm supposed to be talking about, and speaking of staying faithful, you know the drill: movie good, not great, held back by quite a few flaws, so let us stop \"fiddling\" around and get right into this thing, because something pertaining to this film should probably be short and to the point.\r\n\r\nThe film has been called immensely faithful to the play on which it's based, and sure enough, it is extremely faithful to its stage counterpart, or at least I can safely presume that, because although I have, of course, not had the opportunity to see the original stage play, it's clear as day that this film is a faithful adaptation, as it is so very faithful to theatrics in general, though perhaps to a fault. Norman Jewison drenches this film in an extremely theatrical feel, pumping it with that kind of overwhelming spirit that really doesn't translate all that well to film, thus leaving the perhaps overly lively dialogue and forced incorporation of musical numbers to come off as rather awkward and detrimental to the film's compellingness, as it taints a conflicting atmosphere. Now, it's not like the story is terribly consequential to begin with, yet the theatrical livliness of the film dilutes conflict, and with it compellingness, as well as the necessity for the film to be as long, or rather, as overlong as it is. Whether it be because of the many forced overlong musical numbers or because of the film's staying faithful to the theatrical sensibility of dragging things out so that people don't find their money squandered on an all too brief theatrical affair, the film achieves its 3-hour runtime forcefully, maybe not to where it finds itself meditating upon total nothingness or especially expendable material, but still to where it finds its momentum further hurt, and the unevenness of the pacing doesn't help either. With all of my complaining about the film being so overlong, quite often, certain scenes feel relatively tight, thus leaving incorporation of the overlong moments that give this film its excessive length to fall into play uncomfortably and render the film's momentum to further run askew. Now, looking at the premise, it's not like this film held the potential of being terribly outstanding, yet it does deserve to be handled better than it is, being overlong and overblown to the point of losing some steam and, by extension, substance impact. However, within entertainment value lays this film's redemption, for although the film is so overwhelming, with not quite enough dramatic bite to it, it remains an immensely enjoyable film, being able to back up its problematic theatrics, for the most part.\r\n\r\nAs I said, Norman Jewison stays faithful to the original play by actively drenching the film in theatrics, and there's no not doing that as much as he does without problems arising, so of course this film was doomed to get too lively for its own good, yet many genuinely good things can emerge from this livliness, if of course you have the entertainment value to back up the theatrics. Well, as sure as sunshine, Jewison compensates for his making the film so unapologetically theatrical by making it wildly entertaining, breathing into this film fiery charisma and flare that reflects theatrical grandness and keeps the film thoroughly engaging and delightfully lively, especially when it comes to the musical sequences. Though as overlong, overused and rather forced as the numbers found in most every musical of this type, the musical numbers in this film are outstanding, with Sheldon Harnick's memorably catchy lyrics and Jerry Bock's sweeping compositions going considerably well-executed, and complimented by relatively simple yet still dazzling set pieces that keep you tapping your toes and having a grand time, even if the numbers do often throw off the focus on the film's substance a bit, no matter how much the lyrics \"pertain\" to the scenario at hand. Of course, when the story does fall into play, while its effectiveness is hurt by the uneven pacing, bloating and theatrics, it remains a strong and fascinating story, with resonance that, when actually handled well enough by Jewison's storytelling, really does ring home effectively and memorably, and the film owes much of its story's effectiveness to the character aspects. There are many characters within this film, and they're all so very distinct, colorful and memorable, largely thanks to their faithfully colorful portrayal. Now, certain performances are better than others, with a few performances falling a bit flat, being that this film is so theatrical, yet most everyone incorporates distinct charisma - while really playing up collective charisma through razor-sharp chemisty -, with leading man Chaim Topol particularly owning the show with his delightfully boastful, blazingly charismatic and, on occasions, a touch dramatically soulful portrayal of Tevye the dairyman, a good-hearted and considerably faithful man of tradition and experience who still has much to learn, and will learn during the journey through faith, tradition and humanity around which this film's worthy story and themes are built. Again, the film's story isn't especially outstanding, though it does deserve better than this film's presentation, yet what the film is presenting is so immensely charming, wildly entertaining and delightfully theatrical that, by the end, it's kind of hard to mind the film's excessiveness, as you'll ultimately walk away rewarded by a genuinely good time.\r\n\r\nBottom line, the film is perhaps too theatrical for its own good, with writing and tones that faithfully translate from stage to the screen with moderate awkwardness that proves detrimental to the effectiveness of the film's substance, which is further tainted by an excessive length and uneven pacing that helps in keeping the final product from really hitting home, which isn't to say that the final product doesn't strike a chord in the least, as the film really does resonate much more often than it doesn't, boasting outstanding musical numbers and immense entertainment value, spawned by the strong story and lively concepts, brought to colorful life by Norman Jewison's delightfully charming direction and a slew of distinct, charismatic and memorable performances - the most memorable of which being by the sparklingly charming Chaim Topol -, thus leaving \"Fiddler on the Roof\" to stand firm as a thoroughly wildly entertaining and, at times, reasonably resonant portrait on a new age's affects on tradition.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

One of the greatest musical films ever created and arguably the best. Rated by many as the number one film depicting the Jewish people. And many secular Jews often looked to this film as their main knowledge and spiritual feelings about their own religion. \nThe acting, dialogue and singing by each actor/actress are perfection. The songs are very memorable and quite great. \nThe movie deals with a family embodied in strict religious tradition. Tevye, the main character has a wife and five daughters. Struggling with not having any sons to help him tend his livestock and milk services. While even acting as a horse to his own horse! Still, he maintains a content outlook having his faith, town folk and family to keep him at ease. This all becomes tested when three of his oldest daughters marry men he would rather them not. Tradition is broken quite a few times, not to mention the Russian establishment harassing and eventually expelling his family and entire town at the end. \nThat is the most narrow, gist summary of this film. Their is so much more and even my own words cannot describe the greatness of this movie. And if I even attempt to try, and tell you everything wonderful about it and what makes it so great. I'm afraid this review of mine will be many times longer. \nThe movie tests humbleness and faith vs coveting, love, persecution and with outstanding depth, character analysis and strong perseverance allows a people written with historical persecution to carry on once again. The fiddlers violin, along with the powerful emotions heard in every song transcends this aspect of the Jews remarkably. \nThe people who made this didn't just perform plastic surgery, they performed brain surgery and everything else.\nMy favorite movie of all time.",

            "content": "Ah yes. This is one of my favorite musicals. I was actually a villager when we did this in high school which was a lot of fun. But enough about that, let's finally finish the whole VHS movie that were from that bag with Fiddler on the Roof.\r\n\r\nPlot: Tevye is a poor milkman living in the Jewish town of Anatevka. He lives with his wife Golde and his five daughters. In Anatevka, there is a matchmaker named Yente to decide who should marry who. And she recently decided that Tevye's oldest daughter Tzeitel should marry Anatevka's very rich yet old butcher, Lazar wolf. Tevye agrees, but Tzeitel wants to marry the very young but poor tailor Motel. After begging to Tevye, he agrees to let Motel and Tzeitel marry. From there Tevye faces many other changes in his life from the things that happen to some of his other daughters to what happens to Anatevka.\r\n\r\nI like the movie and I love the musical. The characters are lovable, the story is good and the music and dancing are a lot of fun. I do admit that it may be a little longer than it may need to be. There are some very minor scenes that while are a little helpful to the story at some points, removing them from the film wouldn't be a terrible loss to me. But either way sort of work regardless. And even then it's an excellent film filled with music, dancing and all around a lot of fun to watch. A very well done adaption of the Broadway musical.\r\n\r\nActor/Character:\r\nTopol/Tevye: Tevye was a very fun character in particular. He was a caring father and liked to talk to The Lord an awful lot about the things that happened to him, and he was a good character all around to used for showing the world that the people of Anatevka lived in and to show what happened with all of the change that would happen to either to him or his entire town. He may not have deserved an oscar for his performance, but Topol still did an excellent job worthy of at least being nominated for his performance.\r\n\r\nMusic: Yeah, like I already said, the music is a lot of fun. I mean hopefully a lot of you are familiar with some of the music already, at least with the song \"If I were a Rich Man\" but there's also \"Tradition\", \"Miracle of Miracles\", \"To Life\", and \"Tevye's Dream\". The music is just so awesome and memorable.\r\n\r\nEditing: I really enjoyed the editing. Especially during Tradition with the rhythm if you will in some of the cuts that they did during that scene. But during Tevye's dream, there were two points where they show a goat in the dream for really no reason. So I didn't see any point in that.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for Fiddler on the Roof, it may be a little long and a slight bit of the editing didn't make sense, but it's still an excellent film with a nice story, lovable characters, and spectacular music that is worth remembering.",

            "content": "Who would have thought that the story of a Russian Jewish family battling tradition and antisemitism would make for a good musical? Yet this movie pulls that off. Fiddler manages one of the tougher balancing acts in cinema by creating catchy tunes and a thought-provoking storyline. Not only is the story interesting it is also a topical piece that will actually make viewers think about their religious tolerance.\n\nIt feels like the only reason this movie works so well is the character of Tevye. He is like the perfect common man that everyone can relate to. He dreams of being rich, he loves his family, and he struggles to balance his religious beliefs with his actions. Having such a lovable guy in the lead role makes it easy for the audience to put themselves in his shoes and sympathize with what he goes through. Topol will probably be remembered for this one role because it truly was his best performance.\n\nThe story is a hard one to swallow. Now I don't say that because it is far-fetched, but because the events are downright tragic at times. However the slow fade of Tevye being forced to prioritize love over his traditions is brilliantly told. You start to feel the struggle right along with him, and sadly it comes both from inside his family and from outside. In fact the only reason I don't rate this movie much higher is that the second half is tough for me to watch. While I know this is closer to reality, I just prefer something a little more uplifting (especially when I watch musicals.) However, personal preference aside, Fiddler on the Roof is a brilliant musical that everyone should see at least once.",

Epic, emotional, and nothing short of entertaining, this is actually a sweet tune.\n\nA poor milkman with a wife, 5 daughters, and a farm lives in a tight-knit Jewish community somewhere out in Russia that is built on tradition. Only that will be tested when his daughters' desire for true love get progressively more \"modern\", causing dilemmas in the milkman.  Meanwhile, life in the village is threatened by the forces from the outside world.\n\nIt may seem like another cheesy olden-day musical sprinkled with naivety and innocence, but, in the introduction, it is inviting, due to Topol's presence. He does an excellent job worthy of much commendation. So does the rest of the cast, which shares so close of a bond that their performances feel natural. The editing, while choppy and flashy, at first, is precise and expertly done. Lavish, bright cinematography and intricate sets with an eye for detail, a fantastic score with skillfully performed musical numbers, and realistic historical context with that script make for AAA production value.\nThe direction seems synchronized with just about everything else. It's all dovetailed with an enchanted sense of fun, delightfully and humorously reflected, to counter with its deep, poignant layers later on.\n\nThis fiddler loses a little bit of his grip because things get a little too haywire. Frankly, it's overlong, overdone, overrated, and a little overkill. But that's alright, though it does get somewhat formulaic. Not everything's tied up neatly, and it is trying on some people's patience. Some laughable\nand questionable moments only take the film's focus away. Even the film's most glaring flaws are easy to forgive though, making it mostly enjoyable.\n\nFor a musical, it's actually reached the zenith of its genre, along with \"Singin' in the Rain\". By those standards, that makes it pretty damn spectacular, compared to the stuff of today.",

And man, this most be the best musical I've seen. The wonderful love stories, the lovely term called tradition and the lovable characters makes this a movie I want to see multiple times. And let's face it, it's Topol who make this movie with his lovable character who always bring a smile on my face every time I think of him.\n\nFiddler on the Roof follows Tevye the milkman who lives in the jewish village named Anatevka in the early 20th century, in tsar russia at a time where antisemitism was growing stronger in Europe. A town bound by jewish traditions. We follow Tevye's daily troubles with his job and his total of six daughter who seems to care less about tradition than their parents, in sense of actually choosing the man whom they chose to be their husbands. When it's actually up to their father to decides. His family is poor, and hopes one day he become rich. His dreams are very good explained in the song \"If I Where A Rich Man\" with is a classic. But it's seems to be difficult for all of Anateyka's jewish inhabitants, when the Tsar sends out other to chase the jews out.\n\nFiddler on the Roof is for me probable the best musical ever made. The songs are just so well written, playful, passioned and funny. And of corse Topol deliverers his life performance, a performance that he have played on stage over 2000 times. Topol is a category for himself: I have just fallen in love with his jolly charismatic characters, not only in this film, but also any wear else. He's like Santa Clause, it's impossible to don't sit on his lap. There's only one Topol, and it's impossible to find, or even image another actor playing Teyve then Topol. I just love to shim with him all day, as I sing along.\n\nI could go all day, talking about how great Chaim Topol is, but I have to give some of the other actors some credits, both leading and supporting. Some of them jewish stereotypes. For instance, we have Yente, the matchmaker, we have Reb Nachum the Beggar. But seriously, we have other great leading performances like Norma Crane as Tevye's wife Golde, and also Leonard Frey who does a wonderful supporting performance as Motel, Tevye's son-in-law a tailor that doesn't seems like the ideal husband, because of his clumsiness, and lack of courage and masculinity. But it's certainly a delight when he sings. To keep it short, there's a character for every one. A big thumbs up from me.",

ACTOR and harvested 3 of them (music score, sound and cinematography).\r\n\r\nRunning time is over 180 minutes, I exerted myself quite hard to finish the film. Being an adaption of a success musical, the film version holds steady the same axiom \"Music is the cure!\". The melodies and riffs have a dominating impact so that the shallowness of the corny script (three marriages, specifically encountering money, politics and religion obstacles) should not hinder the sonic amalgam. \r\n\r\nI'm rather a peculiar person, as usually, musical has never been my cup of tea, let alone a prolonged one, despite of the fact that I'm a true contemporary music aficionado. The only fun I can acquire is from Topol's \"If I Were a Rich Man\", which I just realized is the catchy refrain of Gwen Stefani's hit single \"Rich Girl\". \r\n\r\nMaybe after 40 years, the didactical preaching through music has been outdated for my generation, also in a utopian world, Jewish or not is not an issue anymore (the same thing suitable for genders, religions, colors or sex orientations), so bearing the label of a nihilist, I find that John Williams soul-freeing score are much more tempting than Jerry Bock's oldies soundtrack. Anyway, one thing I can not deny is Topol's strenuous but fabulous performance (personally Paul Mann's Lazar wolf is my pick), which will never become bleached through all these years.",

While watching this film, it is clear to see that Norman Jewison has taken special care in the production of the film. Visually, this film is beautiful seeing the country side and showing how it changes from a poor village to an overworked piece of land that is barely holding on. The story for this film is, sadly, one of the weakest parts. One thing that a lot of people hate is repetition. This is a film that repeats itself quite a bit. The basic formula is this: Daughter gets married, Father is upset, he gives in. Now, one of the redeeming parts of this overworked plot is that it continues to work every time. Acting wise, the only person worth mentioning is Topol as Tevye. He is seriously the only actor that develops his character, and actually makes it worthwhile and good. The rest of the cast is mostly (and sadly) one dimensional and I personally do not care for that. They introduce some good characters that I would have loved to see changed and developed, but the acting of Topol makes up for them all (thankfully). Now, the score is the complete highlight of this film and what makes this film worth the watch. There are few films that treat the subject of Judaism with respect and this is one of those films that does. The music, the set props, all capture the beauty of this heavily abused and neglected and tortured religion, and finally there is a film that gives dignity. So, overall, I say see this film if you love the original stage play, like the works of Norman Jewison, or like good musicals. But if you are expecting a deep, philosophical story line, then you are looking in the wrong place. Now, why am I recommending this story? Simple: It does what it does and what it does it does well.",

Made in 1971, its 2001 DVD treatment left a lot to be desired.  At last, a Blu-ray edition comes out this week.  But the quality of that transfer still remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe musical works better on stage than it does as a motion picture.  Jewison's version incorporates a lot from the stage play but certain elements that work on stage do not necessarily bode well on film.  By using a lot of the material from the stage production, the film does get bogged down and has some pacing issues.  It does not warrant its 3-hour running time.\r\n\r\nJewison also uses a lot of close-up shots of the actors to show dramatic tension but in the process, these posed shots feels forced and staged rather than a natural act of a true emotion.  Still, the film manages to deliver where it counts.  The renditions of \"Tradition\", \"If I Were A Rich Man\" and the tavern dance sequence are all nicely done.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there is a certain lack of energy and imagination in Jewison's \"Fiddler\".  Except for the set decoration and costume designs, he really does not bring anything else new.  The film is very pedestrian.  For a story in which a lot of it takes place outdoors, its landscape shots and cinematography also does not shine.\r\n\r\nAs the film will not be remade anytime soon, it is best to catch \"Fiddler On The Roof\" live.  Its \"classic\" status will and shall remain attached to its stage version with this film adaptation a few notches below it.",

            "content": "I recently watched Fiddler on the Roof and although it does have a very important message to the Jewish people I also found it highly entertaining. In the story a father tries to hold his family to tradition until a traveling teacher comes along and causes a stir within the political and familial doctrines. He shows an old world man that he doesn't have to settle for the hand he is dealt and that he should allow his children the right to choose a different way other than the old ways. The lesson of life and love surviving amidst chaos plays a large role in this musical starring Topol who also starred in the Broadway version.\nTeyve is stuck in the time when a matchmaker chose who would wed based on the benefits to the families involved. He is also taught that you do not go against the anti-Semitism movement because God is allowing these things to happen because the youngsters are forgetting their place and the teachings.\nI really like this movie because although light hearted in some instances the terrible plight of the Jewish is still displayed. The unfairness of having important celebrations and their homes destroyed based on hate and ignorance is clearly portrayed in a manner that even a non-Jew may understand. The movie for me is truly about perseverance and striving to live life to the fullest because you may not always have that freedom based on the biases of others. The story caused Teyve to rethink his stand on the things he had been taught to believe because he watched as the lives around him were torn apart by people who hated him simply because of his religion. A person's action should dictate haw they are perceived the systematic annihilation of the Jewish people in Russia, Germany, Poland and other areas of Europe was an atrocity that is still being perpetrated on others as well as Jews.",

            "content": "Based on the Broad way musical of the same name, this is the epic story of finding the balance between tradition and progress. It's set in the Orthodox Jewish section of the tiny Russian ghetto town called Anatevka in the early 1900s. \n\nThis film is a bit overlong, and a little boring here and there, but aside from that, it is wonderful. It works better as a stage production, but it's still fine as a film. For the longest time, everything I knew about Jewish culture came from this film. It's portrayal of the Jewish people and culture (specifically Russian Jews) is quite accurate by many accounts, but a little laughable and stereotypical if taken out of context. \n\nI really like this movie, and it is one of my favorite musicals, but this isn't something I can bring myself to watch very often. It's a good story, but man, it's so depressing. I guess in the long run the story has a happier ending, but if you discount that, it's got a very bittersweet conclusion that seems to further reinforce the idea that Jews have such a miserable and downbeat history. \n\nThe acting is mostly pretty great. Some are better than others, though. It was controversial to cast him, but Topol makes for a great Tevye. It would have been awesome had they gotten Zero Mostel to reprise the role though.  The music is basically the star of the show, and it's essentially flawless..unless you don't like musicals. If that's the case though, then you have no business watching this.  I also really love the sets, costumes, and the camera work. The attention to detail is fantastic, and things just look gorgeous. \n\nI'll conclude this review with an interesting story: my dad, good Roman Catholic man that he is, enjoys this story so much that he tried to persuade my mom to name me Lazar Wolf instead of the name I ended up with. That's awesome.",

But as I see it this film is universal in its showing of whay it means to live and be human: family, beliefs, neighbours, love, joy, struggles, prejudice, and much more -- and of course *Tradition*.  And in that it moved me greatly.  \n\nThe film was beautifully shot, and I loved the long shots in particular where Tevye was pondering change and tradition in his dealings with family issues.  The songs were wonderful, and while Tevye takes centre stage, the others involved all bring delightfully real characters to the screen, Tevye's wife Golde [Norma Crane] in particular.\n\nA film that was for me uncomfortable to watch when you see man's prejudice and hatred of difference, but at the same time a film that left me with hope.  I'll be watching eagerly for news of a musical production of this near me.",

This opening scene sets the stage for the next three hours, where music tells the story as much as the characters do, and the lead character reveals his thoughts through informal conversations with God, who he converses with as one would a friend.  Tevye has an avaricious side to him (If I were a Rich Man) and a trouble-starting side (Take your diseased chickens....), which is trumped by his good-nature and likeability.  The film must conclude on a sad note, as anyone who knows the history of Jews in Tsarist Russia knows it must, but there is a personal triumph of sorts that makes the ending palatable.  The best part of the movie, of course, is the soundtrack, which should leave you humming for days.",

            "content": "Fiddler on the Roof is based on the musical of the same name, which is based on Tevye the Milkman, a collection of short stories written by Yiddish author Sholem Aleichem. First of all, I haven't read the stories or seen the musical, so I definitely can't make comparisons.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the musical is a gem. The songs are great and the score is fantastic. The score was actually orchestrated wonderfully by John Williams, who is responsible for writing some of the most famous film-tunes that we all know like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter and Jaws. As much as I think Williams writes great tunes, one of the problems I have with his scores as that these signature tunes play ALL THE TIME in the films they're from. Every time Darth Vader is on the screen in Star Wars, the Darth Vader music plays and on top of that, you hear the theme all the time. The same went for Philosopher's Stone (NOT SORCERER'S STONE FOR GOD'S SAKE), where Hedwig's theme plays all the time. This wasn't the case in Fiddler on the Roof. Williams actually had some variety when he fused the traditional Jewish melodies with classical music.\r\n\r\nThe songs in the movie were also wonderful. Although I think Lazar Wolf's song went on for a bit too long and was a bit irrelevant to the plot (especially since Lazar doesn't marry Tzeitel), the rest of the songs worked perfectly in the context of the film. Topol had a wonderful voice and as for Norma Crane, it's good to see an alto in a lead female role!\r\n\r\nFor me, the thing that really stood out about the film was the characters, especially Tevye. I love Tevye. He's a poor Orthodox Jew who may be old-fashioned and extremely traditional, but overall he means well and cares about his family so much. He's just so good-natured and likeable. Usually I can't stand traditionalists! Golde was a very strong character too and each of the three main daughters were really interesting. \r\n\r\nTzeitel is interesting because she's willing to rebel against the unfair traditions of the day and goes out for what she wants, whether people approve of it or not. Hodel is interesting because she starts out as a girl who's waiting for her prince to rescue her; an anti-feminist. But then she realises that what she really wants is to dedicate her life to the Russian Revolution (which unfortunately didn't end well). Chava is interesting because she's willing to do everything she can to get what she wants, even if it means having to leave her family.\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick a fault with this movie, it would mainly be the length. Although I didn't have a problem with it, most people won't likely want to watch a movie that almost goes for three hours, despite the fact that it's based on a stage musical. \r\n\r\nThe other fault is that although I really liked the scenes they showed portraying the persecution of the Jews, I think they could've pushed it a little further, maybe even killing off one of the characters. I'm not saying it should've been violent like Schindler's List, but I think if they had shown a bit more violence, it would've given the musical a new level of depth and showed how Anti-Semitism is wrong. To be clear though, these faults are only tiny and can be forgiven. They're only things that if done differently, the movie would've been extra-extra awesome.\r\n\r\nI say for anyone who loves musicals, Jewish culture or likes history in general, they should definitely give it a watch. It's accurate, it's fun and it's good natured. In general, this is truly a wonderful movie.",
