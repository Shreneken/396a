The acting was easily the highlight of the film overall. The cinematography is ok feeling very obnoxious at times trying to give a very isolated and hopeless feel. But I always felt it could've been accomplished in a more subtle way. The black and white was cool. The editing & pacing for me were the biggest problems here as they felt like they were more short stories being chained together without any continuity. I can appreciate that the message all of these stories were trying to convey was feelings of hopelessness and defeat but it came across as more pretentious and abstract. This made the pacing really suffer as I felt every scene was just trying to drive home the same point and message and it got repetitive by the second half of the film. These short stories never came across as part of a bigger story for me. It was interesting to watch the characters stories at times as some scenes were more interesting than others. I felt sometimes some scenes had no point for the actual plot though and was just confused and frustrated at times. Unfortunately I'd have to say it was an ok experience and average overall but definitely unique. If your a fan of New Hollywood Era Films give this a try, maybe you'll see something I didn't.",

Not to mention some very bad acting by Cybill.  I guess folks in the 70s just loved the shock value of nudity and large age gaps between sexual partners.

This was Texas in 1951; that sum'bitch was gonna get his head blown off!  The village idiot is run over by a truck and half a dozen men treat the incident as no worse than had a stray dog been killed.

There is also interjection from the older generation who offer advise to the teenagers \u00a0( not generally the right advise ), take advantage of their naivety and spend time looking back at their own golden years.\n\nThe only source of fun in the town for the teenagers are an all night cafe, pool hall and the run down movie house. All three of these rare escapes are run by the town's old cowboy and businessman Sam the Lion ( Ben Johnson ) \u00a0who becomes somewhat of a father figure to Sonny until his untimely death.\u00a0\n\nAfter \u00a0jilting Duane and going out with multiple boyfriends, Jacy sets her sights on Sonny. This results in the one and only fall out between the two best friends and ends in Duane leaving town to join the army. Director Peter Bogdanovich is unafraid of showing sentiment resulting in some of the best moments of \"The last Picture house\"\n\n\"The last Picture House \" gives its audience a snapshot of the beginning of change in the early 1950's. It takes the view the mistakes and path chosen by the older generation is pretty much how it was and how it will be for the younger generation unless radical change happens. A great soundtrack and brilliant performances, \u00a0along with clips of old movies to contrast the drab lives of the towns folk, \u00a0deliver a wonderful experience.",

I hesitate to offer the slightest  criticism of this Bogdanovich classic, but there are loose ends, like the high school coach. And his desperately unhappy wife, played Cloris Leachman in one of her greatest performances, seems to inhabit a movie of her own. I know it's a two-hour movie, but what's up with that?

The cinematography was conducive to the narrative style in that there wasn't a rigidly structured, linear story to follow in the traditional sense, and instead the viewer was dropped in to witness the events of these lives, in this town, for a specified period of time.\n\nThe performances were pretty exceptional all around with Cybil Shepherd, Cloris Leachman, and Timothy Bottoms all deserving mentions. Ellen Burstyn actually takes the MVP here for me though in a role she stood out in, despite being much smaller in comparison to many others.\n\nThis was the type of film I definitely gained respect for, and understand the heavy praise, even though I didn't completely connect with it personally or was ever able to totally lose myself in it. 7.5/10",

Anarene itself is a bleak take on the human experience (or almost a purgatory; the town really has little justification for its existence, just persisting despite its seemingly meager nature), where little of substance ever changes apart from death and sex, the focus of most of the characters. Self-reflection only invites a sense of emptiness or longing for what is perceived as lost. It could also be construed as a commentary on the flimsy nature of society and personal relationships; the individuals are impulsive, driven by instinct and passion, and almost animalistic, and there isn't an objectively healthy romance in the script. The lack of color might be an immediate write-off as an artistic try-hard move, but the visual elements absolutely fit with the themes. Performances are fitting and strong across the cast list, including a young Jeff Bridges. (4.5/5)",

Granted, there's more at work here beyond that, it's still impossible to deny that all other elements take a back seat to the overall subtext at work. With this in mind, no single component takes more of a hit than the pacing. Combined with the fact that this is already a relatively quiet and subtle experience for most of its running time anyway, \"The Last Picture Show's\" deliberate cadence will be sure to try the patience of at least some viewers.

            "content": "This may be one of my favorite films because it focuses on all of the elements I love, a close-knit community with many secrets, teenagers coming of age, older woman-younger man love affairs and disgruntled housewives. Ensemble dramas can be great when done well and this is a prime example as a great cast assembles to portray flawed, complex characters with detailed histories as various conflicts arise in their small town. The cinematography is gorgeous and the direction is subtle but able to capture all of the nuances necessary to make the emotional releases of various characters devastating. I believe that this one of the best films of the 1970s and definitely a film that everybody should watch.\n\nSonny, Timothy Bottoms, and Duane, Jeff Bridges, are high school best friends living in the small town of Anarene, Texas in 1951. They are both in love with the shallow and manipulative Jacy Farrow, Cybill Shepherd, whose mother Lois, Ellen Burstyn, is having an affair with her husband's employee Abilene, Clu Gulager. After the boys treat the autistic Billy, Sam Bottoms, cruelly they are punished by Sam \"the Lion\", Ben Johnson, who plays a large role in the town's affairs and has a tendency to wistfully remember the old days. Sonny begins an affair with Ruth Popper, Cloris Leachman, the wife of the high school football coach. The two boys come of age in this environment and when tragedy befalls the town many shocking secrets come out.\n\nFilms about teenagers have a tendency to be dismissed as immature and lacking in substance but the problems of teenagers as they become adults can serve as a rich source of material for an interesting story. The problems of teenagers, and their parents, are treated seriously here while it is also acknowledged that the decisions the youths make probably won't matter as the war looms. Jacy feels like the most immature of the friends as she throws herself at any man who will have her and uses her sexuality to manipulate the men around her, echoing her mother's actions. She seems unaware of what the future holds for her and makes potentially life changing decisions like getting married on a whim. Of course the male teenagers are also immature but they are less performative in their actions and can be seen to be more emotionally mature than the adults that have raised them.\n\nThe screenplay is good at revealing backstories without feeling strictly expository as the adult characters' pasts are revealed through the subtle hints and implications instead of being told to a character who would already be aware. It also allows for emotional and dramatic moments like Lois' breakdown at Sam's funeral but for the most part these responses feel natural and the dialogue always seems to fit the character it has been assigned to. A significant part of the film is the youths understanding that the adults were also once young and made their own mistakes and had their own problems. I appreciated the recognition of the difficult relationships that adults have with their past selves and the pains that come with watching your children make the same mistakes you once made. All of these unique touches make the film great and although in the hands of wrong actors this film could be terrible the screenplay elevates the quality of the production significantly.\n\nAll of the acting is great in this film, even Cybill Shepherd does good work, however Cloris Leachman deserves singular praise for her stunning performance as Ruth Popper. It would have been so easy for her relationship with Sonny to veer into feeling inappropriate or for Ruth to be seen as a pedophile but Leachman makes Ruth so disarmingly sweet and sympathetic that we can't help but support her in the decisions she makes. The moment at which she finally snaps, the final scene of the film, is earned because Leachman had given such a quiet, restrained performance up until that point and her character's emotional breakdown felt real. \n\nThis would be on my top 100 films if I were ever to compile a list and beyond admiring or respecting it I love it and always enjoy watching it. This is one of those films that I can't understand people not liking.",

            "content": "Produced by Hollywood iconoclast BBS Productions, film critic-turned-director Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 film pays homage to Hollywood's classical age as it chronicles generational rites of passage in Anarene, a fictional one-horse Texas town. In 1951, high school seniors Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) play football, go to the movies at the Royal Theater, hang out at the pool hall owned by local elder statesman Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), and lust after rich tease Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut). As the year passes, Sonny learns about the pitfalls and compromises of adulthood through an affair with his coach's wife Ruth (Cloris Leachman) and a thwarted elopement with Jacy after she dumps Duane. Following two tragic deaths, and with Duane gone to Korea and Jacy packed off to college in Dallas, Sonny is left behind in Anarene, wise enough to absorb the life lessons of Sam the Lion and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn). He is determined to honor Sam's legacy as the town's conscience, despite a telling sign of incipient communal disintegration: the closing of the Royal Theater after a final showing of Howard Hawks's Red River. Paying tribute to classical Hollywood directors like Hawks and John Ford, Bogdanovich used old-time cinematographer Robert Surtees and shot The Last Picture Show in crisp black-and-white, with a restrained style devoid of the kind of \"new wave\" techniques (jump cuts, zooms, and jittery hand-held camerawork) used by such contemporaries as Arthur Penn, Robert Altman, Mike Nichols, and Martin Scorsese. As in such Ford films as The Grapes of Wrath (1940), Bogdanovich relies on careful visual composition in deep focus to help communicate the regret over the passing of an era. Hailed as one of the best films by a young director since Citizen Kane (1941), The Last Picture Show premiered at the New York Film Festival and went on to become a hit. It was also nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay for Larry McMurtry's and Bogdanovich's adaptation of McMurtry's novel. John Ford stalwart Johnson won Supporting Actor and Leachman won Supporting Actress, beating out their cohorts Bridges and Burstyn. For an audience steeped in movie history and caught up in the chaotic 1971 present, The Last Picture Show presented a nostalgic look backward that was not so much an escape from the present as a coming to terms with what the present had lost. Its 1990 sequel Texasville, in which Bridges and Shepherd played later incarnations of their original characters, was not as successful.",

            "content": "I had some high hopes for The Last Picture Show when I saw that it was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, because I\u2019ve never disliked any of his movies yet. The cast was also promising, as it featured a number of stars that I love including Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Eileen Brennan. However, this was not my style of film. I\u2019ll admit the acting was superb from most of the cast. All those stars that I love delivered amazing performances, and sold the heavy emotions of their scenes. In fact, there were a few of the older women who I wish were center stage more, because their stories were much more interesting to me than these teenagers. The only sub-par acting came from Cybill Shepherd. She is not terrible, but I couldn\u2019t follow her emotional journey, so the conniving and vile manipulation didn\u2019t feel motivated by anything. The movie looked great, and for once I actually understood the artistic purpose of black-and-white in a color era, and it didn\u2019t seem like a pretentious choice. My big problem is that I seldom enjoy coming of age films, so The Last Picture Show had an uphill battle to win me over. And this particular coming of age film is all about people that I find unpleasant. Also, it is primarily focused on the sexual aspect of their maturation, which doesn\u2019t interest me either. I\u2019m not drawn in by teens who seem solely motivated by their hormones, and who make zero logical choices. I recognize these aren\u2019t crazy or unrealistic characters, but they are the kind of people I spent my youth trying to avoid. I struggle to make myself care about the horny kid who will sleep with the coach\u2019s wife one minute and his best friend\u2019s girl the next. I am utterly turned off by the girl who wants to force her boyfriend to have sex just so she can sleep with another random dude. The Last Picture Show is loaded with well-told stories that feel like they are fairly timeless, even though they are clearly set in a particular time and place. I can see why this movie is critically-acclaimed and loved by others, despite the fact that it\u2019s unappealing to me.",

A supposed coming of age tale, where everybody acts like idiots and we're supposed to sympathise them because they're 'young and wild'. It's hard to tell what's worse here. The story, which is virtually non-existent; the acting, which is awful; or the pacing, which is sluggish to the point that it never feels like it's moving at all. Ben Johnson & Cloris Leachman, both of whom won acting Oscars, are barely in the film at all, and honestly don't deserve the awards for what they contribute to the film. The lead actor, Sam Bottoms, a man with one facial expression: Suffering from mild toothache, is a bad lead, and neither he nor any of the other principle characters ever become engaging, and in a movie which is over 2 hours long that makes for seriously dull viewing. It feels like it actually tries to be boring, as if wasting the audiences time is its sole reason for existing. There's so much dead air in the movie, with so little sound being used, even in scenes where there should at least be environmental noise like wind or the lapping of water against the shore. I often thought that the sound guy kept forgetting to come to work and score the film. Having watched a couple of scenes he probably decided it would be better to stay away from it all together, advice I sincerely wish I had followed.",

It is a pessimistic point of view whereas it centers on a couple of teenagers coming back from war doing what regular teenagers do.  The only purpose for the town to exist is so that truckers using it as a passersby upon carrying goods to another town- for none of the truckers stop for coffee.  We're then introduced to some teenage characters as they're going to the one theatre to watch movies and eating in the one diner, much of the original residents had already left.  No mention of policing or hospitals nearby we're not given the whole picture which limits viewers to this kind of format leaving us with nothing except the atmosphere, and that can sometimes not efficient to hold the movie.  Winner of two acting Oscars for Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman out of 8 nominations. \r\n\r\n2.5 out of 4 stars",

Even with its most serious moments the movie's characters try to crack a smile under their warm tears. It is important, and sad, and moving, and oh my god, you'll be close to tears when Billy dies.

            "content": "Aesthetically, this adaptation of Larry McMurtry's story about disaffected, sex-crazed teens could hardly have been less designed to appeal to that demographic when it came out in 1971.  Set in a shriveled-up Texas town in the early 1950s, filmed in black and white with a soundtrack of Hank Williams songs, and featuring homages to old John Wayne and Spencer Tracy movies, there were few hints that the movie contained some of the raciest content possible in a mainstream release.  Which is not to say that its content was entirely new or cutting-edge; the bleaker and more mature \"Hud\" (1963, also based on a McMurtry novel) had shown a boy's coming-of-age in a dysfunctional, dying Texas town, and the more fashionable \"The Graduate\" (1967) had depicted a multi-generational love affair involving a younger man and an older woman.  What \"The Last Picture Show\" brings to its treatment of these themes is a larger, more diverse cast of characters who each embody a different facet of the community.  Some are unsatisfying archetypes and ciphers, like Ben Johnson's \"Sam the Lion,\" and \"Billy,\" a mentally-disabled child.  Most, though, are sufficiently complicated and believable, particularly the women played by Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Cybill Shepherd.  Shepherd had no previous acting experience, but carries much of the movie on her shoulders and nails all of the big and little things about her character.",

It has everything: lost love, false love, death of a father figure, loss of friendship, loss of innocence, and loss of dreams. The story takes place in a town that doesn't exist, and probably never should exist, because everyone in town is unfulfilled, unhappy, and lost all ambition. But the film is absolutely perfect in its portrayal of a lost time, a time where everything looked up, but then everything went down and so did everyone's happiness. The narrative plays out like a good old fashioned picture, but it adds in the depth of 1970's filmmaking, and the result, is one of my favorite films of all time. Bogdanovich creates the perfect desolate tone with ever shot, which only contributes more to the feeling of lifelessness in this small town. But he also stays true to the notion that this is a fictitious town by conveying a sense that this town exists only in itself, that this town is not real, but is a representation of what all towns and people feel at this point in time and modern times for that matter. The Last Picture Show is truly a masterpiece that ever teenager should watch.",

The people, young and old, have little to do beside work and when they're only source of activity, the cinema, pool hall or diner, slowly shut down, one by one, they turn to sex. However, the sex is desperate and cold, devoid of romanticism, distances everyone from each other. Thus fueling the feeling of imminent demise of this small town in Texas.",
