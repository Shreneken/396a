Inspired casting of Gene Hackman at the very apex of his craft, a true and unequivocal acting masterclass, paired with the brilliant Roy Schlender.  Wonderful movie, that never loses pace or momentum for a second.  I've personally watched it 40+++ times, and counting. Always, always, always an event!",

Gene Hackman gives a great performance and the foot tailing/chase scenes, along with the final confrontation scene with the police, are the most memorable. William Friedkin has amazing directing talent and I've only seen his work in the Exorcist other than this, which is also a really good movie. I wish that I had watched this sooner!!",

            "content": "\"The French Connection\" is a film that has grown on me over the years, evolving from an initial impression of it as a dated and tiresomely one-dimensional procedural drama to a film which engages the viewer with a suspenseful and immersive cat-and-mouse experience that unfolds with the intensity of an increasingly high-stakes chase sequence. The dynamics between Cloudy and Popeye Doyle round out the drama with the only degree of character development that is truly necessary to the story, transmuting an otherwise superficial crime drama into a morbidly engaging character study. While I was stunned and yet initially perplexed by a heightened tone of haunting ambiguity that seems to leave the events open-ended, a recently seen interview between Friedkin and the real-life Cloudy corroborates the legitimacy of some of the most strikingly unresolved elements of the film. \"The French Connection\" offers up the kind of experience that makes you want to savor every morsel before taking the time, after the fact, to muse over the bewildering implications of the story's conclusion.",

            "content": "In the seedy streets of late '60s New York City, smuggling schemes are hatched, large quantities of international drugs skip the customs line and one big-personality gumshoe catches the scent. Heroin is the name of the game, with a major French player looking to expand his operation abroad. Street smart detective Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) has a hunch who's responsible, and how they plan to get the drugs into the country, but his track record isn't exactly spotless and his superiors in the police force aren't anxious to give him much leash. These criminals are awfully adept, too, and the mandate to get it done by the book is a major obstacle.\n\nHackman's sleuth stumbles and fails repeatedly. He shows ugly traits. He's not someone we feel good about cheering, but he's a step up from the snide, murderous scum he targets, and at least his tenacity is admirable. Besides, the city itself may be The French Connection's biggest star: a buzzing, stinking time capsule of cheap lives, dirty air and pervasive corruption that's convincingly cold, real and unforgiving. Director William Friedkin's guerrilla approach to filmmaking is largely responsible, charging his hand-held cameras straight into the bustling crowds (and often without the proper permits). While he's on the chase, Doyle carelessly shoulder-blocks onlookers and recklessly slams his vehicle into oncoming traffic, and it all lacks that familiar air of smooth, polished Hollywood unreality. This almost feels like a lucky documentary crew that caught a big fish during their ride-along, fifty years in the past. The long-gone version of NYC still lives, breaths and barks, an essential component of both the characters who live there and the ways they choose to pass their lives.\n\nThe specifics of The French Connection's story are mostly established in passing - mumbled or implied - so, in typical \u201870s fashion, it takes attention and patience to really understand what's going on. I didn't care for the ending, not because it's ambiguous but because it's so hasty, but I enjoyed the ride right up to that point. Particularly the white-knuckled train chase in a commandeered muscle car.",

            "content": "The standard post-2020 gloss on movies like this is that times have changed so much that they are now from a different planet, but watching this one especially made me feel like we are still in the long 70s. There was a brief moment when the racism was explicit; then for 30 years the same scenes were re-shot with \"diverse\" villains in the same archetype and the overt racism of the protagonists mostly tuned down or out; and now maybe there's a split between earnest attempts to unpack all of this and earnest attempts to make the racism explicit again.\n\nI keep coming back to the well of cop movies as much as preoccupation as entertainment, though I do find a fair number of them entertaining. This actually felt gripping as a movie. I went through the whole Dirty Harry series a few years ago but somehow had slept on this. And wow ... thinking about how the ideology of the renegade enforcer meets up with the reality of a lot of meticulous moments, boredom, and fuckups, this really gives a fascinating package. The term \"police procedural\" is terribly misused; but this is a movie that is actually interested in procedure.\n\nThe movie doesn't romanticize Popeye Doyle; compared to this, Dirty Harry is screaming (if unorthodox) copaganda. Doyle is presented as having flaws so deep they are just as likely to lead to tragedy as to successful law enforcement. But the movie does lead you to see the things from his perspective, and almost out of sheer exhaustion at his determination, the viewer finds himself wanting Doyle to get his man. And the movie was such a success that it inspired a sequel and several knockoffs trying to use the same character. An antihero, his ugliness and failure plain enough to see, who nevertheless inspired relentless imitation. The contradictions are clear enough, and it's hard to argue that we have in any way escaped or successfully confronted them.",

With its appearance on Disney+ some time ago, the recent Oscars and subsequent \u2018Winners Lists' being updated, and my having more free time than I would normally, here I am!\n\nHowever unapologetically nihilistic, unsympathetic, and most definitely prejudiced, this contemporary artwork is, it stands as an example of film-making that has since been lost\n\nLong sequences cover the drudgery of cat-and-mouse policing, as much as they flow on fossil-fuel-burning chases, which means we experience the suspense-building lighting of the fuses, as well as the moments the bombs go off!\n\nIt's testament to the directorial vision and to the writing, that this still holds a place in movie-making history.

There is action and mystery in all the right places. The shots of New York in the 70s are amazing as I am a sucker for nostalgia. Feels really gritty and grimy in the best kind of way, which is exactly what the real New York I think is meant to be. THE chase scene is sick and I can\u2019t get enough of seeing old New York. Not a single bad character in the entire film, as each one seems to be perfectly flushed out and we go through the ebbs and flows of what a day in their lives seem to be. I really felt like I was there with them following around the bad guys, so fixated on every little move. Everything about this movie is AWESOME and the twist is one to die for.

Brooklyn detectives Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Cloudy (Roy Scheider) are investigating a heroin smuggling cartel transported from Marseilles. After a series of interrogations and tailings, Popeye eventually discovers the perpetrator of the narcotics underworld, Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey). For me, the scenes where Popeye gets almost close to catching drug mobster's tails are the greatest parts in the movie. First, Charnier knows he's being tracked and fools Popeye into thinking he left the closing subway doors, when really he's trying to escape to Washington DC. Second, after an awesome car and ell train chase, Pierre (Marcel Bozzuffi) ejects from the train, sees Popeye below the stairs, and just as Pierre attempts his escape Popeye shoots, killing him. Last, in the end, Charnier and his thugs take shelter in an abandoned warehouse surrounded by the police. Popeye is entirely close to capturing the drug lord, accompanied by Cloudy. The officer runs into the dark room in the warehouse where Charnier supposedly is and a gunshot is heard, but the Frenchman escapes. What a clever ending to a kickass movie. \n\n(4 \u00bd Spicy Chicken Combo Meals out of 5)",

The problem I had with the movie were the multiple instances of attempting to endear Popeye to audiences by showing how he mistreats black people, as it's done in a way that seems to assume any given black person is a criminal & thus it doesn't matter if Popeye exceeds his domain. I was also dismayed at how underplayed the climax was as I felt sold on it, like I was sure it'd be more than it was. I had mixed feelings on seeing this screenplay from the same person that had written the Shaft novels as he had clearly understood the genre & then felt his later character was a plot twist rather than starting off with him, which would've felt more genuine. After seeing this & Italian Job I think it's fair to say that I never knew how much a role CGI played in very good car chase scenes until watching these two as both have scenes that are regarded as great chases & have gone down in history as top-ranked thriller movies when the reality is that CGI has enabled radically more exciting chase sequences nowadays that just haven't earned much recognition as usually no individual had to emit an impressive amount of effort for them even when they're superior to the non-computerized version. I was put off a bit by the music in the few places where it was outright recognizable as it felt like risks were being taken and I had read in advance abount the composer (an enormous risk-taker) being unproven in the genre of film scores; given the Oscar credentials of the movie, someone else should likely have been in charge of the score. I nitpicked the movie in some areas (they advanced plot through editing but still included long shots of non-critical actions like following the main characters walking around, etc) & just tried my best on first viewing to recognize all of the trivial notations I read about the editing and whatnot.",

Despite the film's critical reception, you can't help but feel that popular culture has unfairly left it behind among 70s/80s action in favor of films that established franchises, or featured more typecast leads; in that way, Hackman's capabilities as an actor may have indirectly limited the long-term popularity of The French Connection.

The combination of Roy Schneider and Gene Hackman works well. Gene Hackman playing things on many hunches but feeling slightly unhinged at time with Roy Schneider the more calmer.  At times the film is a little slow as the two leads follow suspects around in their car for long spells. This can drag as the first half does appear slower. The second part of the film is more interesting and exciting. Including the famous car and train chase soon. As the car drives, dodges and crashes to keep up the train. Its very well choreographed, feels very real. The end shootout scene is very intense. From the camera feeling like that's our vision. The camera work generally is very unstable which is as expected as we are always looking out for things.  Its constantly moving and flickering. Popeye is too concerned with the ends and this creates a flawed character who can be hard to like. Its a times a brutal film, the opening killing shooting at his face is shocking. The film shows the time period well but also the lack of morals of the police force as they hunt for the big fish. An entertaining second half of the film makes the film but it lacks of in the emotional investment of the main characters. An action and crime thriller which has enough gritty realism to make it stand out.",

(Hard to believe he was initially selected for the role of Mike Brady on the Brady Bunch!)\n\nAs police officers, Hackman and Roy Scheider are not boy scouts by any means. Assaulting criminals, shooting people in the back and saying things like, \"never trust a (n-word)\", these are flawed, real people out to do their job by taking down foreign drug smugglers.\n\nThe camera work, and editing are superb. 1970's New York City is almost a character of its own. (Only 1 of the World Trade Towers is completed in the background). The car chase under the moving train is an outstanding masterpiece of cinematography. This is an action flick of the highest caliber, so don't expect much character development. But seriously, to try and insert it would just weight things down.\n\nFasten your seatbelt!",

This was a very good, very well made film that is deserving of all the praise that it gets for being an influential action movie but it shouldn't be the Best Picture of any year. Yes, it's technically well constructed but the characters were thin, the plot was exceedingly thin and the screenplay didn't contain the gems found in something like Carnal Knowledge (1971). Part of the problem is definitely that it wasn't targeted at teenage girls who enjoy conversation based films and not a film that's main attraction is a car chase and Gene Hackman's supposedly great performance.\n\nThe film concerns two police officers working on a drug bust, Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider. they traipse around the grimiest parts of New York City in their increasingly desperate quest to find the drugs and have them arrested. Big set pieces including the famous car chase scenes and Hackman's many tempter tantrums.\n\nMy biggest issue with the film is that it is largely boring and forgettable. I watched the film just two days ago and already the only things I can remember about it are the car chase scene and the removal of the sill from the car to get to the hidden drugs. Scheider who is so great in Sorcerer (1977) and All That Jazz (1979) gets little to do and Hackman is just a vessel for violence in the lead role as he does little more than narrow his eyes and redden his cheeks to convey his character's absolute determination. With two characters I really couldn't give a flying fuck about being the only two people that we really get to interact with in this film it's hard to stay engaged. The action is only so exciting before it becomes tedious and you become aware that this will be the entire film action with an underdeveloped purpose and nothing characters.\n\nOf course the car chase is stunning, it's edge of your seat exciting as you feel as though you are in the car with Hackman and Scheider in their dogged pursuit of their mark. The setting around them feels authentic and the driving feels dangerous as you question the sanity of the drivers. This sequence would influence so many films to follow but they're not really films I'm all that passionate about. This scene is just a tiny sliver of a film that's mostly dull or just bombastically stupid, watch the scene on youtube as much as you want it really doesn't get old quickly but don't invest hours of your life into this film as a whole.\n\nWatch The Last Picture Show or Carnal Knowledge if you take anything away from this film, they are better written, directed and acted than this overrated action flick. It shocks and surprises me that something that relies so heavily on one sequence could win over two films that are superb throughout. Watching Cloris Leachman throw her coffee at the wall and emotionally breakdown is a more gratifying experience than seeing Hackman angrily cuss at a stressed mechanic. Jack Nicholson's manic intensity and all-around oddness is a joy to be presented with while Scheider's moody man of few words act is great when used well but here Friedkin seems unaware of what he is working with.\n\nI would recommend the two other films I have already reference before I would even bring this film up in conversation. I am girly and I do like films that are more emotional than physical experiences but this is a film that is weak other than a few stunning sequences and that is not enough to call it the \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~Best Picture' of the year because that implies that the film as a whole is better than the many great films to come out of 1971 and that is simply not true. If your tastes a similar to mine stay away from this overrated winner.",

The concept itself suggests the cat and mouse chase but this is not your usual in and out mission. It stays there along with it. No matter how hard and sweat inducing this labour gets. And since it is based on a true story Friedkin's hands are tied but his methods aren't tied to any whatsoever promise. He seeks for an opportunity to stretch its way out through a bang for a more cinematic experience. If there ought to be a simple man to man marking on following a guy, he does it with such panache that you are left with you jaws dropped in the air. He milks out something from these scenes that you have never felt before.\n\nIn fact, what he does in here, MacQuarie in Mission Impossible Fallout has managed to do so in the Paris sequence. I have never felt the thrills and exhilaration that a chase scene can offer like such. The feature barely resides upon verbal sparrings it is basically all physical sequences performed lethally and for the most part of it, in one shot, that adds a cherry on top of it. One of the primary strength of the feature, is its uncertainty, the makers keeps us under the shades and reveals it at the point of crisis where before that the storyline is just setting up the antics just like the characters are chasing each other blindly with all the dedication and sweat and blood there is.\n\nHackman as a frustrated underappreciated protagonist makes sure you feel the need for him to succeed as much as he does and on that note of vulnerability that is projected, it is a complete triumph.

The movie is far from perfect and certainly not as flawless as many reviewers say it is. The scenes in Marseille focusing on the gangsters for example are unnecessary since they don't add anything in terms of story or character and they slow the movie down considerably. The pacing issues are made worse because there isn't a lot happening that is worth of interest. The story is very simple and barebones, with underdeveloped characters. Popeye Doyle is probably the most interesting character, but he isn't exactly a character with a lot of layers. The movie does \nhave several merits though. First of all Gene Hackman is a treat to watch, showing great tenacity and intensity as the cop with anger issues. Secondly, the level of grit and realism displayed are to be commended and were clearly an influence for many films to come. New York looks downright dirty and grimy here. Thirdly there is the famous chase sequence which has passed the test of the time and is still thrilling by today's standards. \nI felt a bit like the character of Popeye Doyle in the end, feeling frustrated and wanting more after the anticlimactic ending. I expected more of 'The French Connection' and I certainly wasn't blown away by it, probably because of the revered status the movie has acquired throughout the \nyears.

Friedkin has great directing skills and the car chase sequence is already considered one of the finest ever put on film though I personally found it a bit overrated and not as good as the one in Friedkin's other film To Live and Die in LA. Regardless, you should check this film out if you like hard gritty films full of tough guys.",

Despite the distracting nature of this, I was still able to enjoy the film for the most part; but I have to say that, bearing in mind this is one of the 'all-time classics', I was slightly underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, the film has many attributes: a great chase sequence and a sense of profound realism being among them. Yet, nothing really stood out to me as truly exceptional. The plot is serviceable but basic, character development is limited and I didn't, for the most part, care for any of them. The performances are solid, but again, not anything special. It just seems like a very middle-of-the-road cop thriller. It's a film I'm glad I've seen, and one that entertained me throughout; and one that has clearly had a great impact on the crime genre, but it's either dated or - dare I say it - overrated.",

Again perhaps its is the grime of a cold, winter New York versus the relative sunshine of San Francisco?\nAlso the film ends pretty downbeat with drugs being smuggled into New York via a Lincoln car, Charnier escaping the law and a ruined building scene.",

It's tense, fast-paced, shot beautifully and has a brutal, kinetic energy that had me on the edge of my seat throughout. The drawbacks include an unnecessarily long runtime and a very meandering plot, with several parts of it feeling directionless. It has a pretty sporadic musical score too, with some scenes having no music at all and others having too much. Ironically it's the scenes with no music which I found the most enjoyable, as they rely on all natural sounds, creating a much more realistic atmosphere.

This is a \"warts-and-all\" production where the leading character is seen as a flawed and not terribly likeable character who despite his shortcomings, is brilliant at his job. Gene Hackman plays the character of \"Popeye\" Doyle with great style and skill, making him as believable and ruthless as he is interesting. The grimy underbelly of New York in the late 1960s and early 70s is an unglamorous and crime riddled backdrop to the action which focuses on the attempts of a criminal gang to open up a transatlantic drug route. Doyle and his team have been working hard to kill the drug trade in the city and become suspicious when they see a small time crook living the highlife and holding secret talks with a group of visiting French businessmen. It's a gritty, hard-nosed tale with some terrific action and a great pace. The direction, though dated, is taught and the delivery and setting is realistic. It is amazing to see just how much New York has changed since this movie was made 40 years ago, it really is almost unrecognisable.

Everything changes instantly and soon taken over by intense screenplay and performances mixed with an exhilarating tail and chase sequence building up to a clever and perfect climax. This movie can be referred as a lesson on how perseverance can pay.\n\nDoyle (Gene Hackman) is a cop in the narcotics bureau who is often criticized for his backfired hunches but well supported by his chief along with his partner Russo (Roy Scheider). Doyle and Russo come across a charismatic couple Boca's in a bar and tails them since they had a bad feeling. Their observation provides leads into some unknown shady deal about to happen. All this seems connected to a Frenchman Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) but the details are still hazy. But Doyle's perseverance and unconventional work ethics helps to put pieces together. \n\nFirstly a special commendation should go for the intense and exhilarating chase sequence between a car and a hijacked train. A role of an obsessed cop or a detective is nothing new but when played by someone as talented as Gene Hackman it just gets better. Hackman plays the role with measured intensity, carelessness, obsession and a sense of humor. Roy Scheider gives an apt supporting role while Fernando Rey is very inconsistent ebbing and surging the character's image constantly. Background score isn't too loud which is otherwise very common for thrillers during its era while the photography is very enjoyable with its perfect wide shots and intense maneuvering for additional thrills. The graphic violence lacks technical prowess succumbing to a low quality finished product in a couple of scenes. Though a little disconnected in the beginning, the screenplay pulls up from its lull intensifying and ends up playing the winning role for the movie. \n\nIf it ends well, all is well",

Gritty and tactile, despite being almost five decades old, the movie still resonates with audiences to this day, which is testament to its inspired direction and strong performances.\n\nGene Hackman portrays the vicious and obsessive 'Popeye' Doyle, a New York based narcotics officer of dubious principles (he shoots an assailant in the back), who spends his days endlessly pursuing (generally black) junkies throughout the grimy streets of a city that's dark side breathes viscerally from the cinematography of Owen Roizman. \n\nMany would understandably point to Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets or Taxi Driver as truly capturing the murky underbelly of the great American metropolis, but it was actually Friedkin (once a documentary filmmaker) who conveyed that sordidness first. \n\nIt could be argued that the city is the ultimate star of the movie, serving as the stage that offers credibility to The French Connection's plot and characters.  As we watch, it feels like we are witnessing a totally separate world inhabited by disreputable individuals on both sides of the law. In 1971, that must have felt like a revolutionary development for the movies.\n\nDoyle and his partner 'Cloudy' (played by the always reliable Roy Scheider) are in need of something major to retrieve their flagging reputation within the force. That dream potential bust comes in the form of Fernando Rey's Alain Charnier, a dapper and unflappable Frenchman who is orchestrating a huge trans-Atlantic drugs deal with the Mafia. The movie grants us access to the criminal process. \n\nHurtling at a rapid pace, the film doesn't pause for concentrated character development, but drops enough crumbs along the way for the audience to build up an understanding of what drives Popeye. It was a role that established Hackman (at the age of 41) as one of the great actors of his generation, which he would later carry into further acclaimed performances in movies such as The Conversation, Mississippi Burning, and Unforgiven. \n\nGarnering plaudits for its thrilling chase scene, with Popeye in his commandeered car pursuing one of Charnier's associates on an overhead train, the entire movie is essentially a pursuit. It is the smaller moments that stand out most of all, not least the sequence in which the Frenchman expertly finds a way to evade the Hackman's piercing eyes on a station platform. Friedkin allows the scene to play out at length, demonstrating the slick intelligence of Rey's character. \n\nThat may indeed be the real strength of the film. It provides its key players with the opportunity to display their intelligence. Consequently, The French Connection feels smart, with an abrupt and nihilistic conclusion that kicks dirt in the eyes of neatly tied together endings.",

No, this is a straight-up crime thriller that dumps you right in the middle of \"Popeye\" Doyle's investigations. It's gritty, immediate and raw. The interconnected plot itself isn't so enthralling to me but the film soars primarily on William Friedkin's unflinchingly atmospheric direction and the lived-in performances. The film does hold you by the hand in any way but leads you in visually to figure things out as the actual French connection is eventually revealed; it is well-represented of Fredkin's unabashed style of filmmaking, and I love it for that. Gene Hackman carries the film excellently, Roy Schneider supports like a pro and this features one of the most iconic chase sequences ever put to film. - 8/10 (B+)",

It's nice that his slobbish style has something standing out for it. Would you believe that Mr. Hackman is fighting the French mafia in this movie? Who ever heard of the French mafia? Did it exist before or after \"The French Connection\"? Not really, unless you watch a lot of french language gangster movies which are actually movies Hollywood tried to peddle to French audience. What Hollywood did was photocopy their Italian mafia movie theme, then make everybody talk French. After all of the \"French connection\" movies were released, the french mafia disappeared. Gee, I guess a pork pie hat, like a falsely advertised handgun, does make you a good cop. And yes, it's true, Mr. Hackman does catch the French mafia kingpin at the end of the last movie in the series, though not in the first one. The almost unintelligible script, that seems to have been written by someone who was either intoxicated or hadn't finished grade school, is not helped by Mr. Hackman's acting which surely must be counted among the worst in Hollywood, Throughout Mr. Hackman's long Hollywood career, he displayed only two emotional states. He is truely 2 dimensional. Many critics have applauded the car chase scene that took place under the NY train bridges. It must have been the influence for George Lucas' final death star scene in the first \"Star Was.\" The complete unreality of it makes it seem like science fiction and I kept wondering, even hoping, that aliens might appear to save an otherwise horrible movie.",

Nevermind that holding way too far back and not doing anything until arguably it was too late was a terrible strategy for Hackman and the other cops, the last shot where he goes after the mastermind and then it cuts to what happened to everyone feels really cheap and almost like they just gave up 5 feet from the finish line.  \n\nIt's too bad because the other 98% of the film is fantastic and for the end to bring it down nearly a full star rating is unfortunate.

There are so many moving parts in this movie, and it moves at such a blistering pace that if you aren't really paying attention, you can get lost.  First off, this film was made with every intention to be as realistic as possible.  There were very little \"extras\" - the background folks were literally people just going about their everyday lives.  The structure of the drug import, how it's tested, how exchanges happen, etc. - everything was accurate to the time.  So, that gives it mass points to begin with.  The story is very engaging and there isn't a speck of boredom or bogging down at any point.  The dialogue is crass, vulgar, and very witty.  Gene Hackman is absolutely on fire in this film, and his interactions/exchanges with Roy Scheider are top notch.  There is a lot of stalking/following which effectively builds the suspense and intrigue.  This film has everything you want in a good cop flick...pompous but smart criminals, obsessed/borderline delusional cop who has great hunches but cannot control his impulses, great chase scenes (the car tracking the train is shot beautifully), an end of movie standoff/shootout, and a superb ending with a little twist.  Also, the good cop/back cop take (\"I'm gonna bust you for picking your feet in Poughkeepsie\") is brilliant.  This is just a great, great film.\n\nGrade = 10/10",

Can they cut the Frenchmen off at the pass and prove their theory?\n\n\"He's everything they say he is.\"\n\"Are you everything they say you are?\"\n\nWilliam Friedkin, director of The Exorcist, Killer Joe, Rules of Engagement, Jade, Blue Chips, To Live and Die in LA, The Boys in the Band, and Good Times, delivers The French Connection.  The storyline for this picture is interesting and reminded me of Serpico.  The acting was pretty good and I enjoyed the script and action.  The cast delivers solid performances and the cast includes Gene Hackman, Roy Scheider, Fernando Rey, Bill Hickman, and Tony Lo Bianco.\n\n\"Your scrapbook is like you, a mess.\"\n\nI was excited when this was recently added to the online Netflix queue and decided to give it a shot.  I felt it was solid, but nothing overly special and a step down from the similar film Serpico.  Hackman played his role solid and this was a nice addition to the genre, just not a classic.\n\n\"Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie?\"\n\nGrade: B-",

            "content": "The French Connection has become quite famous for containing one of the greatest car chases of all time. Although \"car chase\" seems like a misnomer, since it's really a car chasing an elevated train instead of another car. This is a great sequence, and I can see why it has become legendary, but there's a lot more meat on this film than just that scene. This film is basically a realistic police procedural. It feels like we are actually seeing how real police work happens as Popeye and Buddy track down leads, act on hunches, and hope that eventually the criminals slip up. My biggest complaint with the movie is that many times they try to put us in the shoes of the detectives, so they don't give us much information about what is going on. This works in some films, but I found myself agitated and eventually disinterested because I had no idea what was happening and why. As the movie progresses we learn more and more about the criminal activity, but by then I'm just anxious for the big bust to happen. So the movie did pull me back in, but I wish I was fully engaged from start to finish.\n\nGene Hackman is excellent as a detective who is willing to do anything in order to catch a crook. We see him shouting racial slurs, roughing up people for information, and even getting into fights with other cops just to make a point. His passion is palpable and it really pays off in the climax. Roy Scheider is also good as Hackman's partner who is willing to go with Popeye most of the way, but seems to have his passion more under control. Sadly, the rest of the cast was one of the other difficulties I had with the film. I was surprised how bland and unremarkable I found the various criminals. Not one of them stood out as the man in charge. As a result I wasn't sure who the big bad was for the climax, who was I most anxious to see Popeye catch? I think it would have been a bit more effective at inspiring passion in me, for that final climactic moment, if I thought this one guy was the kingpin that they needed to arrest/kill in order to make this case a success. Otherwise I found The French Connection to be a riveting film that contained just enough action and solid police drama. It's not one that I would praise as one of the greatest films of all time, but I'd gladly watch again if I had the opportunity.",

I also had trouble believing that's how cops acted all lawlessly saying the n word and manhandling ppl without consequence but perhaps times were different. I didn't care much for the lead cop who had little remorse after shooting another cop dead and was only concerned about the case rather than morality. The ending is rather abrupt and while based on a true story it is stretched a lot from what I read. Also The action doesn't really get started until the end but yeah it certainly does have an awesome car chase scene at the end (one of the best and most tense) and shoot out that saves the movie from being a total flop.",

            "content": "I'm interested in the fact that this was the first R-rated film to score Best Picture, therefore, with \"Midnight Cowboy\", an X-rated film got it first. Nevertheless, this film is hardcore enough for me to ruin some childhood memories by saying, \"So we've been told, and some choose to believe it; I know they're wrong; wait and see! Some day we'll find it, the French connection!\" I was attempting to go for some kind of irony there by referring to something as cheery as \"The Muppets\" in a discussion about a film this brutal, but this film was always to be a little bit cheesy, because, come on, we're supposed to take French drug trades seriously here. I'd say that cartoony cheesiness on the level of \"The Puppets\" in this film is also reflected in Gene Hackman's character having a nickname taken from a cartoon character, but Popeye means business, almost as much as this film's Popeye. Shoot, this director is the dude who went on to do \"The Exorcist\", so you know that this film is going to be both bone-chilling and... a little slow. No, the film is reasonably compelling, but by no means is it especially fast-paced, you know, when it doesn't come to exposition.\r\n\r\nThe film gives you hardly any background on its characters right away, and I ran with that, expecting gradual exposition to compensate, but to my surprise, this film ended up feeling more interested in its action and conflicts than their motivations and the characters involved in them. Obviously, these characters are drawn well enough to be memorable, seeing as how they are well-portrayed and ushered in a number of roles which went on to be conventional in police dramas, yet there's still a surprising lack of depth here, which distances you from the characters, just as coldness in directorial storytelling distances you from most every other aspect. William Friedkin incorporates his trademark hyper-atmosphere here, yet he doesn't exactly have the chilling material of \"The Exorcist\" to bite here, thus, the film resorts to a certain quietness and limpness to pacing which are pretty dull, and recurrent. I'm really not getting the praise for this film's fast pace, because a slow pace is very characteristic in this drama, and although it can be respected for its audacity and frequent effectiveness, more than that, it brings momentum to a crawl as the key blow which sends the final product falling just shy of rewarding. Of course, like I said, a slow pacing is a criticism that one might attach to, say, Friedkin's follow-up, the very rewarding \"The Exorcist\", and considering that the issues of this film tap out with expository shortcomings and a limp pace, while the strengths stand firm, the final product seems to stand a great chance of rewarding, and would have if \"The Exorcist\" didn't have a certain something which compensated for questionable storytelling touches: a richer story concept. As things stand here, there's not much to complain about largely because there's not much to discuss in the first place when it comes to this certainly inconsequential, but dramatically lacking story, whose natural shortcomings combine with the few, yet considerable inconsequential shortcomings in order to render the final product underwhelming and overrated. With all of that said, what the film does right, it does very well, enough so to come to the brink of a rewarding point that, honestly, can be found within a story concept of limited intrigue.\r\n\r\nI just got done going on and on about how Robin Moore's fictionalized account of the true story of Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso isn't quite juicy enough to craft a story concept which can guide this drama through its storytelling shortcomings, but as a realistic dramatization of a police pursuit of men in intricate drug trades, this subject matter remains pretty bitingly intriguing, as surely as Ernest Tidyman's interpretation boasts elements of biting cleverness. Short on exposition, Tidymin's screenplay doesn't have much depth which might have transcended the natural shortcomings of this action-oriented drama, but it's very rarely short on sharp dialogue, memorable set pieces, and an audacious realism which was uncommon at the time, and can at least be respected for that. It's debatable just how much Tidyman broke ground here, and sure, the formula of this film has been explored so faithfully and so often by so many different sources that, by now, it actually feels sort of like the same old same old, but it's impossible to deny the impact that this film had on the police drama, and how it made such an impact largely because it is so engaging. Tidyman, with his many flaws, can't make the film so engaging on his own, and that's where director William Friedkin comes in, with an atmospheric underplay of style of overplay of quiet intensity which is all too often too slow to be anything more than bland, yet not consistently distancing, as it reflects a sophistication that is always intriguing to some extent, particularly when gripping action - reportedly structured around the ultimately removed, and subtly dynamic \"Black Magic Woman\" cover by Santana which people were just starting groove out to during the making of this film - comes into play, and when enough material to draw upon with thoughtfulness sets in to establish tension. There's little actual dramatic consequentiality to Friedkin's storytelling, and that defuses a lot of momentum, but where the final could have leaned closer to mediocrity than compellingness with all of its limpness, there is enough written and directorial sharpness here to hold your interest, about as much as the performances. Needless to say, the performances are seriously underwritten, but for what the performers are given to do, they all deliver, and that especially goes for Gene Hackman, whose commanding, yet somewhat humanized charisma sets a standard for the rough and ultimately well-intentioned cop role that many have tried to emulate since this film. There's not much to praise here, just as there's not much to complain about, but as surely as each complaint is a big one, each strength is solid, and while such a formula isn't going to be enough to make the final product truly rewarding, it is enough to make a very decent, if underwhelming classic.\r\n\r\nWhen the connection is down (Ironically, I type these words while my internet connection is down... if anyone is vaguely interested), a lack of characterization depth, a great deal of dull spells in direction, and thinness to the dramatic consequentiality to the story concept itself secure the final product as underwhelming, but if there is intrigue to this subject matter, then it is done so much justice through clever and innovative writing, sophisticated storytelling, and a thoroughly charismatic performance by Gene Hackman that William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\" comes to the brink of rewarding, even if it's only the brink.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

He plays Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle, a no-nonsense, obsessive narc who is on the trail of a suspected drug dealer with connections from France (hence, the title). What struck me immediately was the was gritty, verite-style cinematography and handheld camerawork. It perfectly fits the subject matter and helps add a sense of realism. Of course, one should mention Gene Hackman's brilliant lead performance. He plays Doyle as an cop who is obsessive about his job, and perhaps too much so. Even while having a drink with his partner after work, he manages to snoop around and people-watch, casing the place and looking for any suspicious activity. Granted his life isn't all work, but it's mostly work. There was also indication that his dedication has produced negative results in the past, so this also works as a portrait of a man on the edge. He's a man with drive, but not always pointed in the right direction. Still, he feels very strongly that the case he's working on is something big. Roy Scheider does a fine job as his partner, but no other character is given near the amount of attention or development as Doyle. Also worthy of mention is a spectacular chase sequence, which was apparently filmed guerilla style (really, most of the movie feels that way, to its credit). It was thrilling to watch, and is one of the best I'm seen committed to film. There were also many other great, tense moments, but that one stood out for being the ballsiest. And really, the pace of the movie never lets up. It's a fast ride from start to finish. Overall, I was very impressed with the look and feel of the film, as well as the fine character work by Gene Hackman. It does feel a little creaky in a few spots, but nothing that ruins the picture. I heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great thrill-ride.",

We've all heard of it. But how many of us have actually seen it?\nIt holds up strong!\nStarring Gene Hackman as Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle, a brash alcoholic but passionate police officer. Roy Scheider received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor as Buddy Russo, his more reserved partner. Their characters are based on real-life detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso.\nThe French Connection was nominated for eight academy awards in 1972 and won five, including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay and Film Editing.\nThe movie dives right in, with Popeye in a Santa suit, and the rare 'chase on foot' through the streets of Marseille. The French part of The French Connection ends rather quickly because the setting soon transitions to Brooklyn for the remainder of the picture.\nLet's talk chase scenes.\nThe FC's got three: Two on-foot, and one via automotive that podiums amongst the top car chases in cinematic history.\nDid Hackman's character introduce the cop clich\u00e9 of commandeering a vehicle?\nAs for the other hunt on foot, it's a passive chase in which both parties are co-aware.\nNo matter the manner of pursuit, Friedkin fires on all cylinders.\n[Quick sidebar: Top seven car chases, in no particular order. The French Connection, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Drive, The Blues Brothers, The Matrix Reloaded, Jack Reacher and Children of Men.]\nWhile attending the Turner Classic Movie Festival, I saw William Friedkin speak, and can happily report he's a cordial, sharp-witted and poignant interviewee. He seems like a really good dude.\nAmongst a number of others, his top films include The Exorcist from 1973 and Arbitrage from 2012.\nAnyway, The French Connection is a riveting thrill ride that utilizes a number of stylistic shooting techniques.\nThe car-dismantling scene will have you on the edge of your seat. \nThere are relatively few weaknesses. Specifically a sprinkling of clunky ADR (Additional Dialogue Recording) and a train conductor loses consciousness in an unrealistic fashion. Other than that, the loose threads are minimal.\nSome plot points require post-viewing research. The ending's a bit puzzling. And Popeye's character utilizes a psychological interrogation tactic that will have you scratching your head.\nWhile he berates Willy with questions, he interrogates the man about, \"the last time he picked his feet in Poughkeepsie,\" in order to cause confusion. According to Friedkin, its inclusion is due to the real-life interrogation technique developed by Eddie Egan.\nSome of the stylistic camera techniques are rather innovative. Like the excellent use of 'silent dialogue.'\nAt one point, Popeye's staking out a restaurant. The cameraman is seated at the table with the two men he's tailing. While Popeye clearly freezes outside, dumping out his presumably cold coffee, the camera slowly zooms in on him.\nIt's an enchanting effect; creating ponderous distance between the audible and visual aspects of the film.\nPopeye's relationship with his stool pigeon is unexpected, compelling and fun. It's an intriguing plot device in which to illustrate our protagonist's scruples.\nAll in all, The French Connection is a fantastic flick.\nIt's on the shorter end of the spectrum.\nIt's poignant, innovative and gripping,\nIt's Gene Hackman at his best.\nYou'll devour it!",

The French Connection is a classic and it's understandable because the film back then was a breakthrough in many ways. The camera work with long steadycam travelings is wonderful, the violence of the character is also unusually brutal and raw and finally the story about drug deals from France to NYC was back then pretty new. Friedkin has created with this film a very bestial film, violent, filled with testosterone and a Gene Hackman that has never been better. This is a great film, a testimony to an era but also the introduction to the vigilante/cop type of characters. A must see for both technical and artistic values.",

A true innovation in the world of cinema, it follows 'Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle' (Gene Hackman) as he tries to bust a drugs ring with partner 'Buddy Russo' (Roy Scheider). 'Gene' is brilliant delivering a punishing characterization with hard boiled cop 'Popeye'. The continuing need, want to be right and nail the french connection when everyone else doesn't believe in it is what pushes 'Popeye' on. \r\n\r\nThe chase scenes are as beautifully crafted as i expected them to be. The story occasionally feels a little disconnected but these moments are rarely evident. When things begin to tie up and 'Popeye' starts to make traction the last 20 minutes are excellent.\r\n\r\n'The French Connection' is excellent it may have lost some of its punch since 1971. But it should still be looked at as the innovative and genre defining film it is. The acting is one of Gene's best performances and 'Fernando Ray' is another highlight as the smuggler.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\n\r\nAre you a fan of Die Hard? Beverly Hills Cop? Hot Fuzz? Lethal Weapon? Good, because this is the one that spawned them all. That's right-- THE ORIGINAL BUDDY COP MOVIE. Starring Gene \"Lex Luthor\" Hackman and Roy \"Jaws\" Schneider as the two cops, this is really one for the ages. My dad has been telling me that this was one of the best movies ever for the past fifteen years of my life. I finally see it, and WOW, it actually lived up to my expectations. It's a spectacular feat of action cinema and totally alive dialogue. \r\n\r\nBesides being entertaining as fuck, The French Connection also has a darker side-- it showcases the underbelly of society by depicting petty crimes, drug use, and criminal enterprises as everyday occurrences. The story of heroin smuggling into the US is age-old, but it's dealt with in such precision and tact here that it's hardly detestable-- it's fucking art. Not to say that the movie glorifies drug use (far from it), but it stylizes everything about itself so much that it's legitimately transfixing. \r\n\r\nAs a side note: Forget what I said in my Bullitt review, this movie has the greatest car chase scene of all time. A marginally prepared, somewhat random scene is set up in which Hackman (or his stunt guy) is told to chase a train moving at top speed on the road below it. There are more than a few hair-raising moments, as he almost runs over pedestrians, smashes a few cars, and generally fucks shit up in his ultimate pursuit of total justice. It's fucking fun as fuck to watch.\r\n\r\nMy only beef with it is that it doesn't quite give Roy Schneider enough screen time, but most buddy-cop movies are like that. Hackman is clearly the leading role here, but when Schneider is onscreen with him, you sit up and fucking take notice. They are a fantastic team, sussing out situations like pros, engaging in a little obligatory witty banter, and charging headfirst into dangerous situations without blinking an eye. They make a few mistakes (one being their incapability to inconspicuously follow someone), but hey-- it happens.\r\n\r\nAlso, the ending is fantastic. I am incredibly lenient on a movie's score when it ends with a non-uplifting, somewhat ambiguous finale (Se7en is a prime example of this). The bad guy doesn't WIN in The French Connection, but it's revealed that he does escape (yeah, spoilers, didn't you read my warning?). Hackman and Schneider never pretend to be the pinnacles of moral righteousness in the movie; they believe that the ends justify the means, and will do anything to achieve those ends, even if it means staking out a Lincoln Continental for sixteen hours.\r\n\r\nAltogether, The French Connection is a classic in its dialogue and story, but the style really makes it. It's a great mix of European style set against a grungy, gritty American backdrop. The dissonance between these two parts to the movie make for some incredible entertainment that is simultaneously taut, mysterious, thrilling, and certifiably badass. \r\n\r\nFinal Score for The French Connection: 9/10 stars. It's the precursor to hundreds of modern films, and deserves a place in history for that. Unfortunately, its rare blend of action and character development is a virtue that seems to have been lost to time, as modern action directors can't be bothered to make a movie as great as this one. But at the end of the day, we'll probably get a remake of this eventually, starring Jai Courtney and Sam Worthington... I shudder to think of it. But no matter how many times modern movies try to reproduce this one, they will almost inevitably fall short.",

The fast-paced story, packed with cinematically irresistible moments as the car chase, alongside other great set pieces, is backed by an interesting, tense, but gently unwinding story-a perfect balance is struck.\n\nThe acting from obsessive Hackman is superb, the extent of the development of his character not fully appreciated until the end of the picture. Hackman is beautifully supported by Scheider who offers a whole new layer and perspective on the seedy NY we view, and the case we follow. But perhaps the most interesting performance comes from Fernando Rey-who plays the sly villain Alain Charnier.\n\nBoth the acting and the story are realistic. Hackman, nor Scheider, are classic, good-looking Hollywood action men-they are scruffy, street smart, obsessive souls who we admire but wouldn't want to be. Nor is the villain clever but too clever for his own good-he often outsmarts the detectives and matches or tops their intelligence.\n\nWe cannot praise the acting without first giving massive credit to William Friedkin, whose brilliant direction of both the acting and set pieces is in a class of its own. The genius of this film is astonishing. Added with this the brilliant score and excellent, natural script make 'FC' a wonder.\n\nThe film, deservedly, took best picture, best screenplay (adapted) and best actor at the annual Oscars. It is a brilliant example of filmmaking which rivals the greatest of crime and thriller films. Superb in every way.",

            "content": "The French Connection is slow to start since it relies on a sizeable quantity of dialogue for an extended period of time with mere small-scale crime dramatics to pass the time and explain just what The French Connection is, but once the intensity strikes the story it becomes incredibly hard hitting and turns around instantly into absolute solid entertainment.\nFor much of the start, The French Connection is a slow story. It doesn't emphasise the brutality of the drama as best as it could have and so by today's standards the quality and quantity of blood, gore and violence no longer have the same effect on the viewer.\n\nBut the intensity does. The intensity in The French Connection is absolutely incredible once it strikes and its some of the greatest I've ever witnessed in a film ever. It hits the characters and the story square in the face with a bullet and provides a rich and racing atmosphere with terrific action ranging from car chasing to catching a sniper, enhanced by an atmosphere bereft of anything but intensity and natural noises and a good level of blood and gore. It's especially the sequence where Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle gets attacked by a sniper and ends up in pursuit of him in which the fine intensity was kicked into gear faster that the car Popeye drove in pursuit. The entire scene is exhilarating without glamourising the dramatics of it through action, and one of the greatest I have ever witnessed in a thriller in my entire life, and so that one scene alone is enough to deserve the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nThat scene, among others are cleverly crafted and feature a fine script, skilled direction, balanced cinematography and an excellent lead performance from Gene Hackman who captures the iconic Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle with a fine gritty charisma and dedicated brutality. His efforts are tremendous and massively successful in The French Connection.\nRoy Scheider also provides one of his finest in The French Connection and delivers a strong supporting role to ensure that there is fine backup to the characters.\nFernando Rey does the same because he keeps the other side of the story alive with his strong villainous character and capture of manipulation with internal thought and facial expression.\nWilliam Friedkin really gave an energetic effort into making The French Connection, and so even though its slow at times it still has a landmark in history for being an excellent dramatic thriller which brought a new level of violence to the screen. The French Connection is a great original thriller with unforgettable intensity.",

            "content": "This one I've only seen the beginning of but never fully finished, but thankfully my brother came up from college and owns the movie. So here is finally my review for The French Connection.\n\nPlot: Based on a true story, Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo are New York City detectives who try to track down the source of heroin coming from Europe. After tracking on a hunch from Doyle, they discover mob members who are agents in bringing heroin to New York from France. So it's put to them to try to find the source and put a stop to them.\n\nWhat can I really say? It's a very good  thriller movie. The story is very well written to the point where the film won best adapted screenplay, it's historically accurate to what happened (at least that's what the National Film Registry says. I mean I don't know the real story, but if they called it that, then that's what it is), and it has memorable performances - most notably Gene Hackman as Doyle. AFI has ranked Doyle #44 on their 100 Heroes & Villains. And for the most part I can see why. Despite his personal problems he is willing to do whatever it takes to arrest drug dealers and bring them to justice. There are one or two moments where I feel he takes that a little too far, but nevertheless I understand AFI's choice for #44. This film is also known to have one of the most famous car chase sequences in film history. Doyle chasing the hit man was a great chase scene - it made the scene epic, it was very well edited and it had a pretty good payoff in the end. I also liked how Alain Charnier was as a villain. The end of the subway scene especially kind of makes it a little wonder that Doyle so desperately wants to catch this guy.\n\nAnd that's my review for The French Connection. It's a great thriller with a great, story, great chase scene, a hero who I do question a little but at the same time understand why is so loved in the film world and is altogether an enjoyable movie and it's little wonder that it won best picture.",

It was pretty stupidly unrealistic far too often and the music to create \"suspense\" was atrocious and nothing more. Such dreadful music that I wanted to kill myself. The chase scenes were VERY well directed and filmed. The part in the subway where the bad guy escapes and waves goodbye sent shivers down my spine because it was so classic. It was gritty and not cheesy. The 35 minutes after the opening scene were wayyy too drawn out and slow. Not nearly enough going on or happening at all. It's a crime that this won best picture but its definitely a good movie. Much better dialogue for a cop movie than anything being made at that time. Liked it a decent amount. 7-7.5/10",

Heck, the whole movie is basically the template for \"The Shield\"-- one of my favorite TV shows-- right down to Friedkin's excellent cinema verite style that helped establish handheld/shaky camera = gritty realism. Roy Scheider is, once again, totally awesome in another 70's thriller where he graciously plays second-fiddle to a bigger, more memorable character (Here, to Popeye; in \"Marathon Man\" to Dustin Hoffman's Babe; in \"Jaws,\" to a giant shark). The two of them make a great pair.\n\nThe famous chase sequence is truly exhilarating, particularly the totally insane POV shots. It deserves every bit of praise it has received over the years, and it doesn't lose any bit of impact even when you know how it gets resolved (They even used the moment on the movie poster!). The final few minutes of \"The French Connection\" is also remarkable in its stark, sudden nature, and like pretty much everything else about the film, I can't get it out of my head.

They think they have happened upon a narcotics job and they use tapping and tailing to close in on the suspicious activity with a french connection. With no real results, they get pulled off the special assignment. That all changes after an unexpected twist followed by a wild chase. Doyle and his partner are finally close to cracking the case but it still takes more work and even more waiting. Finally, they seem to have the culprits but it ends far from perfectly for them. Up to the end Doyle is bent on finding \"the frog\" who has eluded him for so long. The ending felt a little too abrupt for my liking. However, this film did a good job at portraying the ugly and dirty side of New York realistically.",

Everything changes instantly and soon taken over by intense screenplay and performances mixed with an exhilarating tail and chase sequence building up to a clever and perfect climax. This movie can be referred as a lesson on how perseverance can pay. \r\n\r\nDoyle (Gene Hackman) is a cop in the narcotics bureau who is often criticized for his backfired hunches but well supported by his chief along with his partner Russo (Roy Scheider). Doyle and Russo come across a charismatic couple Boca's in a bar and tails them since they had a bad feeling. Their observation provides leads into some unknown shady deal about to happen. All this seems connected to a Frenchman Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) but the details are still hazy. But Doyle's perseverance and unconventional work ethics helps to put pieces together.\r\n\r\nFirstly a special commendation should go for the intense and exhilarating chase sequence between a car and a hijacked train. A role of an obsessed cop or a detective is nothing new but when played by someone as talented as Gene Hackman it just gets better. Hackman plays the role with measured intensity, carelessness, obsession and a sense of humor. Roy Scheider gives an apt supporting role while Fernando Rey is very inconsistent ebbing and surging the character's image constantly. Background score isn't too loud which is otherwise very common for thrillers during its era while the photography is very enjoyable with its perfect wide shots and intense maneuvering for additional thrills. The graphic violence lacks technical prowess succumbing to a low quality finished product in a couple of scenes. Though a little disconnected in the beginning, the screenplay pulls up from its lull intensifying and ends up playing the winning role for the movie.\r\n\r\nIf it ends well, all is well",

It feels astonishingly detached from the rest of the picture and quite unexpected from a story about cops and criminals. This is one of the realistic crime dramas I've ever seen, the director seems to have shed all of \"style\" from it, it's incredibly raw and at times feels like you're actually there. The viewer is never told about the characters or their backgrounds, no detail of personal life; it's all very direct and to the point. Of course, Gene Hackman as James \"Popeye\" Doyle is the show and delivers a raging, yet not outlandish performance. I believe William Friedkin's film is famous for the car chase sequence, but I was more impressed with the train scene involving Hackman and Fernando Rey, where Charnier (Rey) is trying to avoid Hackman and get away once the train moves; both characters keep going in and out of the train until one finally wins. The film lacking any sort of depth underneath can be considered a downfall, granting it's not necessary for this kind of picture. I was entertained and satisfied, but do not see myself viewing it ever again.",

            "content": "The French Connection, Great Movies\nThis is an intense, unremitting, intelligent and incredibly fast-paced film which blends action, cinematic realism, art and humor into a masterwork of hard-edged crime drama. But to categorize this film as drama, suspense or action really does violence to it. This is just a great film, and it doesn't fit comfortably into any category with which I am aware.\nDon't look here for any sense of fantasy-justice or n'er-do-wrong comic book heroism. Look here instead for gut wrenching nihilism, frustration with the unfairness of criminal justice in the hands of bureaucracy, and a solid, plot-driven story about a couple of cops who are just trying to do their jobs as best they can.\nAnd by all means, don't watch this film if you aren't fully awake and willing to be taken down the electric, ambiguous, and compelling roads it leads to. If you watch this film with any part of your brain turned off you'll end up asking questions like \"plot, what plot?\" The fact that some people can't find it reflects more on them as film-watchers than it does on this film. This film does not offer passive entertainment like most of the contemporary action market does. It makes you pay attention, though, at times you might not want to.\nHackman and Scheider are incredible, with some of the greatest chemistry I have ever seen between two young actors. They play two hard-ass NYC detectives looking to end the war on drugs more-or-less permanently by taking down an international conspiracy which they have just barely sniffed out. And make no mistake, they, particularly Hackman's \"Popeye Doyle\" are at war, and treat their jobs as a battlefield. Doyle pursues his quarry with utterly wreckless abandon, endangering the lives of dozens of people along the way. While both men are absolutely terrific, this stands out as one of Hackman's greatest performances, and his Oscar is well-deserved (not something you will see me say often). Backed by a strong supporting cast, and some of the best live-action cinematography of the late 20th century, this film does not allow you to turn away, get popcorn, or even deal with bodily functions for its entire duration.\nConsidered in the early 70s to be 'shockingly violent', this film does not even reach a tenth the degree of passive violent repulsion of the average Tarantino film, and it relies, instead, on amazing performances, flawless direction, a phenomenal post-modern soundtrack and edgy, tense camera-work. Unlike contemporary action film garbage, it also gives you complex characters who you can care about, but never fully understand. I will cut this review short because I am running out of superlatives. Anybody remotely interested in expanding or just appreciating the artistic breadth and depth of mainstream film needs to see this.",

The tone is dark and brooding, and there is a sense of menace throughout the entire film, effectively building suspense even when the police can do nothing but sit around and follow the dealers.  Another one of the film's strengths is its authenticity.  More modern depictions of the flourishing drug trade of the 70's such as American Gangster effectively portray the unique vibe of the era, but The French Connection doesn't have to replicate anything.  It's right in the middle of it.  The dialogue is engrossing, the action is intense (especially the car chase sequence), and the direction is superb.

Right from the first scene with the first character being shot right off the bat you know that it wouldn't be similar to films of that era or any since. Hitchcocks Psycho is a film that similarly did this and I presume they took influence from it perhaps but the shots during this opening scene are beautiful. It lures you into the film with how they flow. And it does set the tone for the rest of the film. Now the film runs the risk of being confusing but that's what I like. It takes its self seriously and doesn't dum the product down for the general audience, it makes the film it wants to be and I salute William Friedkin for that. It's a film that's influenced many and the famous car chase scene is really good especially for the year it came out. It perfectly showed the culture of New York which was Friedkins goal, getting wonderful shots of the skyline, underground and North Tower being built which is the only film ever I believe to do this. Characters are wonderful and the film is made by the performance and characters of Gene Hackman and Fernando Ray. They are amazing characters! And the sequence in the underground is amazing. There are many, many sequences that I loved and kept me intrigued. The opening, underground, car chase, following Ray's character, ending. Everyone of them and more which I havnt mentioned I loved and smiled at while they were happening. It's a wonderful film that's influenced so many other films and it's easy to see why.",

I also loved that while the story was based off true incidents, it's still a completely fictional narrative. That was something totally new for the time, a film that bad one leg in reality and the other in fantasy- yet it was all delivered to audiences with a sort of documentary feel. William Friedkin paved the way with his film and it's effects have been far reaching. But in the end, \"The French Connection\" just didn't do it for me as a film. While I enjoyed watching the actors and the craft of the filmmakers, the story was simply not as engaging for me as I would have liked it to be.

I love Gene Hackman in this film. He is so detestable. He's hard-nosed, racist and just flat out unredeemable, but yet you love this guy and wanna see him get the bad guys. Roy Scheider is also fantastic as his partner, but it's Gene Hackman who really steals the show here. This film also belongs to what I refer to as the Holy Friedkin Trilogy, which is The French Connection, The Exorcist and Sorcerer, which were made pretty much all in a row. They're all masterpieces, and even though he went on to make the fantastic To Live and Die in L.A., it's these three films that really make me respect him as a director.

The French Connection is a fictionalized version Robin Moore's book. Doyle and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo (Roy Scheider) are two undercover policemen. They become interested in a case involving drug smuggling from France to the United States. They receive several problems with their investigation and attempt to crack the case while film's villains try and figure out a way to smuggle heroin and avoid detection. This is what I found pretty interesting with The French Connection in how Doyle and Russo try to follow several suspects and search for the missing puzzle to piece the whole operation together. They go on to encounter various difficulties including from a federal agent. I really cannot go into the detail. The problem I had with this was the film gets a little boring which I am guessing is what an undercover mission is like. Yet, there is a bit of excitement when it comes to several characters following one another which include Doyle and Alain. However, all scenes will be overshadowed by an iconic car chase scene that will literary leave you at the edge of you seat. The French Connection is one pretty cool film not only from the action and stalking scenes, but also to the wonderful and rugged performances from Gene Hackman. I would also have to note the film is aesthetically beautiful in capturing the culture and historical look. \n\n\"You see this scar?

It won Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Adapted Screenplay for a reason, and it deserves every single Oscar it received. The breakout film for Exorcist director William Friedkin, in many ways, this effort surpasses even that horror classic. It''s the go-to film for cop drama, and set a template that many future films have tried (and often failed) to replicate. Friedkin directs the film in a gritty, and then-unconventional style, more suited to documentaries than feature films, and only enhanced by DP Owen Roizman's superb cinematography (little wonder he would bring him on The Exorcist too). Screenwriter Ernest Tidyman adapts the remarkably true story told by the original novel excellently, while Don Ellis provides a brilliant and often startling score that only amplifies the already thick tension that permeates the film, and Jerry Greenberg's sharp editing keeps the movie running at an incredibly fast pace without ever feeling rushed. All these words, and I haven't even gotten to the cast yet. As the Oscar would indicate, Gene Hackman defines his career here, and completely OWNS the role of Popeye Doyle, our requisite good guy, but how good is he is the real question here. Hackman makes him likable and unique, while also reminding us that he is obsessed, borderline violent, and among the most amoral cops working in Brooklyn. Roy Scheider of Jaws fame almost serves as a more moral counterpoint, but Buddy Russo is a bit of an enigma in and of himself. Fernando Rey, as Alain Charnier, makes for an mysterious antagonist, who's strange escape at film's end only adds to the aura of his character, and Marcel Bozzuffi's Nicoli serves as the muscle. Honestly, The French Connection should be near the top of any filmgoer's list. Morally ambiguous, dramatically satisfying, and some truly brilliant action set pieces (most notably the riveting car/train chase sequence, that literally is one of the two or three best chase scenes ever shot on film), The French Connection is truly the complete package, tightly woven into its 105-minute runtime.",

From the beginning, I actually watched this more so as a documentary than a film, because, ultimately, William Friedkin makes this such an effective cop drama mainly through the use of shaky and realistic camerawork. And what an enjoyable thriller it becomes then! Gene Hackman is the most suitable actor who could have played the role of Popeye Doyle, and the duplicity of his character is hidden quite thinly - we can at once guess that he isn't chasing after those drug dealers because that's the right thing to do, but because that might land him in a promotion. But eventually, in spite of all that, Friedkin makes Popeye sympathetic and even heroic. The train chase is perhaps the most thrilling chase sequence I've ever watched, and the ending - which literally ends with a bang - was by far just as shocking as that. It's quite evident that The French Connection, unlike most thrillers today, has used these techniques not merely for shock value or commercial ends, but for pure artistic purposes as well. In the end, that's what makes watching it a really enjoyable experience.",

The chase sequence indeed ranks among one of the best seen in films, thanks to its creativity and realism, along with tight editing and sound mixing, making the chase that much more intense.\n\nAs far as true story adaptations go, The French Connection may very well be one of the best in doing so, with stellar filmmaking and screenplay writing for its time that makes its realistic approach somehow engaging from the beginning of its \"connection\" to its ironic ending.",

When all the stakeouts and car chases and foot chases are done and dusted, this is where the rubber hits the road.\r\n\r\nThe French Connection is based on a true story, as are all good crime stories. It begins in Marseilles with those dubbed 'the french connection' of course. Here we meet Alain Charnier (Rey) who is heading off to the US of A to deal some druggy drugs. Cut to Brooklyn and it is here that super cop James 'Popeye' Doyle (Hackman) roams the streets looking for the big wigs drug lords.\r\n\r\nHe has a dodgy past. His last few busts have been... well... busts. But this time he's sure he's on to something huge and dragging partner Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo (Scheider) along for the ride. When the frenchmen hit the streets of New York City with French star Henri Devereaux (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Pasquale ) all seems to be going to plan. That is, until Popeye stumbles on them, puts two and two together (counting on his fingers of course) and starts tailing and bugging the be-jilligars out of them.\r\n\r\nHe's not a great tailer, with his unique hat and squinty eyes. He runs, stalks and generally makes a mess of the whole thing ending up with Charnier 'making' him. Tensions rise and so do the car and foot chases. Fake blood and gore go everywhere as the frenchies and their Brooklyn associates are taken down... but at what price? Huh?\r\n\r\nThis is a tense, action-packed film. Hackman does a great job running so much and his suspicious looks are well rehearsed. He is a tough cookie. Roughing up all the bad boys in town but it is his puffing running that earns him the big bucks in this film.\r\n\r\nThis movie is like a loveable teenager. It tries so hard to be grown up. The use of milky fluro fake blood was a little cute. It's got nothing on today's realistic gore, c'mon! The typical 70's grainy zoom has a good go at building tension but it is so outdated now.\r\n\r\nI was expecting a really clever film. A few twists here and there but it was fairly predictable in the end. The music was particularly annoying and at one point funny. When the french gangsters are in the restaurant, the music shrills again. Course after course the audience is treated to more horror-film-esque music, like oooo roast beef, tense!\r\n\r\nI loved the train scene where Charnier realised he was being followed and kept hopping on and off the train but in the end it was just frustrating. It was an interesting film from a historical point of view. You can see one of the twin towers being built and the cars are just daaaaarrrling!\r\n\r\nOverall it was an ok film. A good Saturday night filler but not really a great example of a Best Picture Oscar winner! What did you think?\r\n\r\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUdr1LdCsq0&feature=related]\r\n\r\n'The French Connection' Trivia:\r\n\r\n* Budget - around $1,800,000\r\n* Hackman and Scheider rode with cops for a month before shooting began, ending up with * Hackman helping to subdue a suspect.\r\n* The car crash scene was a real life accident but kept because it looked awesome. But producers had to pay the owner of the car that was damaged.\r\n* The on-off train scene was filmed without permission of train authorities and took 2 days to film.\r\n* All extras in bar scene were real life policemen.\r\n* The straw hat on the back of the car was apparently a universal sign of an undercover cop\r\n* The santa scene was based on a real tactic of the original policemen (Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso)\r\n* They used actual heroin in the testing scene unlike some other wussy films that used corn flour.

            "content": "\"The French Connection\" is an intense character-study that is never short on suspense or action. The film won five Oscars in 1971, including the Best Picture Oscar and one for William Friedkin's (only 32 at the time) intense direction. In a year that produced \"The Last Picture Show\" and \"A Clockwork Orange\", this film's win makes it even more impressive than it was nearly 30 years ago.\n\nFollowing a mix of hunches and leads, two tough NYPD narcotic cops set up surveillance on a candy store in the belief that the owners of the store are somehow involved in drug dealing on the side. Putting the squeeze on the store leads them to a couple of new people, specifically a smooth French criminal called Alain Charnier who is trying to orchestrate a massive drug sale in New York. The pressure looks like it's bringing success to Detectives Doyle and Russo, but Charnier's organization has tight time targets and decides to take action to remove the heat from the job.\n\nSometimes with \"classic\" films it is easy to get sucked into the hype and reputation and just love it before you have even seen it; for that reason, although I have seen it several times, I decided to give it a fresh viewing before I dared try to write my thoughts on it \u00e2\" it finished ten minutes ago, so my memory is still fresh. Although I feel that it has remained well known thanks to the car chase and the awesomely done subway car \"rope a dope\", I think that recalling only those scene's is to do a disservice to a film that is an enjoyable thriller in a tough, typically 1970's mold. The plot sees a minor hunch turn into a bigger police job and it would be easy to pick holes in some of the logic within it, it still grips and provides a nicely gritty cop thriller. It isn't as clever or as original as those coming to it on the back of its reputation might expect it to be, as it does pretty much what the rest of the genre does. \n\nThe direction makes it better than the material as Friedkin injects real tension and grit into the story keeping it exciting while also being rather sombre and low-key. The acting also makes it and, rightly, Gene Hackman carries much of the film with a great performance as Popeye Doyle. Grizzled, bigoted and apparently heartless, it is interesting to contrast his character with Fernando Rey's \"Charnier\", who is much cooler and effective. Roy Scheider is, as always, reliable in support and he gives a good performance throughout while the rest of the cast play their roles well enough. There is no doubt though, that Hackman is the heart of the film and his performance reflects this and makes the audience emotionally involved with his story from the very start.\n\nOverall this is a great 1970's cop thriller with all that comes with that genre. It is enjoyably gritty and fast paced with \"heroes\" of questionable morality and smooth criminals. People will always hark on about that car chase and the rope a dope scene, yes, those are great, but there is more to this film and it stands out as one of the best of the genre. Still to this day.",

Now, before you send me messages saying how \"Wrong\" I am and that I don't understand this movie, there IS some good things about it. The suspense is decent, the acting ain't half bad, and this film managed to create a \"Cop\" sub-genre, but just because this film is revolutionary, doesn't mean it's entertaining. Now, if you read my reviews often, you probably know that my favorite part of a movie is the characters. They are the reason I'm engrossed in movies like The Blues Brothers, The Shawshank Redemption, Back To The Future, etc, but this film has no good characters. If I don't care about the characters, then I probably won't care about the movie itself, and in this, the movie isn't strong enough to keep itself above water without good characters. Now, you might be thinking that there's no film that has no good characters, yet doesn't suck, but I know of a few, and probably my favorite is the 2009 Sci-Fi flick \"Avatar\". I didn't care much about the characters as they weren't that interesting, but the scale of the movie, the action scenes, the story, and more distracted me from the poor characters, so much so that I even gave the film 5 stars. THIS film doesn't have any of that, it's just boring, has lame dialogue, and little redeeming factors. Also, the car chase. In my opinion, it's pretty overrated. Sure, it's entirely real, but so was The Blues Brothers chase, which was awesome, and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (For the most part), which was only OK, but hey, it was better than this. All that happens in the chase is a car chases a train, the car hits a few cars, the train is hijacked. A few other things happens, but everything else is just either unmemorable or spoilers. So, yeah, it's a pretty bad movie, and I'm shocked it was even mentioned at the Oscars, let alone won a few awards. I would recommend it to anyone that likes mediocre car chases/crashes and anyone that likes cop movies, but everyone else, leave this movie alone, it's not worth watching. 2 Stars.",

Hackman and Scheider are both excellent as the brash but honest partners kicking asses on the streets of pre-Guiliani New York (brought out in all its grimy glory by Oscar-nominated cinematographer, Owen Roizman) and are ably supported by a cast of credibly-portrayed cops and criminals. A stripped-to-the-bone script and editing style maintain the tension even during the lengthy stake-outs and, despite the film's advancing years, it still whitens the knuckles during the innovative and gripping car/train chase sequence. Many films from this period have not adapted well to the passing of time. TFC isn't one of them: its still as hardcore as the day it came out, especially when compared to today's botoxed constabularies. Gritty as they come, TFC gets all five stars.",

Not that it's a bad film, but it's just a film that I wouldn't expect the Academy voters to go for. It doesn't really offer any intellectual insight, nor does it have a complex or thought-provoking story. It's just a simple story about two detectives who try to bust a drug sting in New York City. It does raise a few questions about how far someone will go to capture a criminal, but that only gets a little bit of screen time and isn't the main focus of the film. To me, this film feels like a normal cop drama as opposed to an Academy Award winning film.\r\n\r\nWhile the acting in this film is great, there are no memorable performances or standout characters. The characters in this film are interesting, but not enough that you want to know more about them, or really remember much about them after the film is over. After it was over I simply referred to the main characters as \"The guy Gene Hackman played\", and \"The guy Roy Scheider played.\"\r\n\r\nSomething that I really did like about this film was the pacing. It was very well paced and also very fun to watch. The action sequences were entertaining as well, but like I said, not entirely original. But I loved the train scene the best. It felt fresh and original, even for someone who watches a lot of modern action and chase films.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's just me, but I personally don't see anything amazingly spectacular in this movie. I just see a very well made cop film, not a masterpiece like a lot of people seem to make it out to be. Still, it's a great film and much better than the average run-of-the-mill cop drama and it definitely deserves to be watched.\r\n\r\n8.6/10",

The French Connection is a tense action packed film with a phenomenal casst that deliver great performances. Director William Friedkin crafts a solid film that remains a classic. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider really have good chemistry here, and they play their parts very well. Both actors are perfect for the roles they played. The French Connection is a well constructed film with plenty of drama and action. This is a memorable film, and is one that is superbly filmed and directed. This is one of the best action / cop dramas that I've seen from this era since Steve McQueen 's Bullit. What makes this film work so well is the blend of suspense, action and drama rolled into one film. The French Connection is a solid film and if you haven't seen it, and enjoy old action films, then  pick this one up. The French Connection is an epic film that is a definite classic of action/ cop genre.

Nixon first used the term \"the War on Drugs\" to describe the systematic (and subliminally racial and politically focused) crackdown on the illegal drug trade at a press conference in June 1971. \"The French Connection\" had a release date a mere four months later. It doesn't seem coincidental that the film portrays the police as a staunch force for good pitted against a Black drug-consuming underbelly and an encroaching foreign presence trying to taint the American way of life. On the surface, this seems like a Nixonian wet dream, and it's probably one of the reasons it was so devoured upon its original release.\n\nUnder the surface, though, we see the toll this takes upon law enforcement and the public at large. In pursuit of a $31 million heroine deal, Gene Hackman's Det. \"Popeye\" Doyle slowly loses his sanity and perspective of what his role as a police officer is in the first place. During the iconic train pursuit, he steals a car, wrecks it several times, and puts the Brooklyn pedestrian population in needless danger. His mind focuses only on the bust and everything else is consequential. That alone makes the final seconds of the film that more psychologically brutal.\n\nWe can take Doyle's struggle and superimpose it on the War on Drugs itself. What is the cost to reward ratio in outlawing narcotics and targeting minority and liberal communities by proxy? No one at the time had that much foresight, but in retrospect \"The French Connection\" makes a poignant commentary. 7.9/10",

This a film for those who love film. I say that because A. The storyline of cops and drug dealers doesn't really matter and B. There's only one fully realized character (Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle.) What makes this movie great is how it's made. The camera pulls you along for the ride, and it's such a raw feeling, it's truly great. The chase scene (one of the best and most tense I've ever seen) has an utterly real feeling about it. Really, the whole movie is one giant chase scene, but it's well worth the run.",

It won five Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor for Gene Hackman and Best Director for William Friedkin. A gritty movie with no punches pulled, it really grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until it's finished... I loved it! More of my thoughts later, after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please track down that guy taking pot-shots at Popeye Doyle while I write the next paragraph).\r\n\r\nTwo hard-boiled cops, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle and Det. Buddy Russo are on the narcotics trail. The word on the street is that there's a big shipment coming in soon, but they don't know where from. Meanwhile, in France, Alain Charnier, is planning a trip to New York. Doyle and Russo get lucky and lock onto Sal Boca, an ambitious low-life who just happens to have made the connection with some French suppliers. He is watched constantly and even the F.B.I. are brought in on the surveillance. Eventually he makes contact and the cops now have more people to follow... Some of which are very dangerous indeed. Will they be able to stop the deal going through? Well, I'm not going to tell you that here... Doyle says he's gonna slam my head against a wall if I do.\r\n\r\nAs I said at the beginning, this film is gritty, no fancy sets, it's all filmed on location. It all looks, and feels, very real which adds to the excitement of the chase scenes, which are all very well done by the way. I can see why it won so many awards, there's something very compelling about it that's hard to define. None of the characters are particularly likable, but that doesn't matter, what matters is getting those bad guys.\r\n\r\nVery much an Oscar-worthy performance from Gene Hackman as Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, ably supported by Roy Scheider as Det. Buddy Russo. Also worthy of note was Fernando Rey as Alain Charnier. Add to this some great stunts, a decent soundtrack and one of the iconic chase sequences (if you've seen it you'll know the one I mean). I really enjoyed this one, not just for it's gritty realism, but also because it's a very well made film... Highly recommended.\r\n\r\nMy Score: 8.7/10\r\n\r\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos, links, trailer and BIGGER PRINT) on my blog at:\r\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.com/2011/04/film-review-french-connection-1971.html\r\n\r\nEnjoy!... :)",

In some ways, I think he is a under-rated actor - very good at conveying his feelings by his expressions.  Doyle is a interesting character, while being very intense, dedicated to his profession, he held dodgy attitudes towards race.  In spite of his views and some of his actions, in many ways Doyle is a really memorable character. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I really liked the contrasting scenes between the mundane part of their police work, such as waiting outside the restaurant for hours and, and the action elements, like the chase between the car (driven by Hackman) and the train (with the assassin on it) and the shoot-out at the end.  I think the movie is fairly realistic (as much as it could be).  In addition, I liked the low key atmosphere of the film, the scenes and storyline did not seem over the top.  There was a lack of sensationism which can hinder these types of movie.  I also enjoyed the scene where Doyle chases the drug dealer and beats him up while wearing a Santa custume!: was very funny. \r\n\r\nSumming up, I think this is a superb, interesting and really entertaining film.  Hackman's performance is great and the supporting cast are very good as well.  He is/was a great actor.",

While it didn't hold me in it's grip for most of the runtime, I can certainly see how it would have mass appeal. In fact, it was more interesting for me to trace it's influences across film history than sit through the film a second time. \"The French Connection\" was one of the films in the 1970s that ushered in American New Wave, delivering gritty, realistic cinema verite camera work in a mainstream Hollywood picture. I also loved that while the story was based off true incidents, it's still a completely fictional narrative. That was something totally new for the time, a film that bad one leg in reality and the other in fantasy- yet it was all delivered to audiences with a sort of documentary feel. William Friedkin paved the way with his film and it's effects have been far reaching. But in the end, \"The French Connection\" just didn't do it for me as a film. While I enjoyed watching the actors and the craft of the filmmakers, the story was simply not as engaging for me as I would have liked it to be. But that's just me and clearly \"The French Connection\" is a noble classic that still has pull today.",

This is a police crime thriller which came when cop dramas showed a much more violent streak, but this enthralled audiences and critics so much, it would win 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. It has New York detective James \"Popeye\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his loyal partner Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) investigating a drug smuggling ring in New York. They learn of a big drugs deal going down and small time restaurant owner Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife Angie (Arlene Farber), who seem to be living beyond their means, with new cars and going out to nightclubs. Turns out they're in cahoots with a drugs syndicate coming in from Marseille, France. Behind it is criminal Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), who tricks French actor Henri Devereaux (Fr\u00c3 (C)d\u00c3 (C)ric de Pasquale) into going with a car full of drugs, a Lincoln Continental. Popeye Doyle has his eye on Charnier, but he seems to be a tough man to catch, and soon Doyle's life is in danger. It's a very taut and grimy thriller, Hackman is hardass as Doyle, Rey is a smooth baddie and Schneider makes a good partner. Friedkin's tight direction, including the car chasing the subway train, was suspensful enough, so he was offered The Exorcist (1973) as his next film.",
