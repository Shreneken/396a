It may be due to nostalgia or maybe it's because it's one of the few movies my father and I watched together when he was still alive. But I will always find this movie to have a beautiful message at the end. Throughout the movie, you follow these characters and you watch them grow. You watch how much Maude affects Harold and causes him to change and value his life much more than he used to. Because of Maude, Harold learned the meaning of life. It shows how we're all different, have vastly different stories, yet we find each other somehow and learn from each other. My favorite line from this movie is Maude when she says \"Go out and love some more.\" That line cuts deeply. This movie isn't suitable for anyone, but if you enjoy dark comedy, please watch it.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude is a dark comedy that has become a cult classic for good reason.  It's smart, extremely well-acted, and laugh-out-loud funny.  Though it was a failure at the box office when it was released in 1971, this film has gone on to gain much deserved acclaim and recognition.  \n\nHarold (Bud Cort) is a young man of wealth, obsessed with suicide and death.  He spends enormous amounts of energy with staging suicide attempts, much to the exasperation of his mother, Mrs. Chasen (played to detached perfection by Vivian Pickles).  Her typical response when finding Harold hanging from a ceiling or cut up on a closet floor is merely one of annoyance.  A scene where she engages in a morning swim (accompanied by Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #1) as she nonchalantly completes laps around Harold's \"drowned\" body is hysterical.  Most of her time in the film is spent as the conduit for arranging possible dates for Harold, something she thinks will assist him in life.   Harold turns each of her perspective date interviews into a spectacle of antics.\n\nWhen Harold isn't planning or staging ways to play out his demise, he likes to spend time attending funerals.  It is at one of these funerals that he meets Maude (Ruth Gordan), an eccentric 79-year-old woman who lives life on her own terms, with little care for standard social boundaries or regulations.  She believes that one should experience something new every day, and she's more than willing to bend the rules of social norms to achieve that goal.  Her joie de vivre is one that Harold is unaccustomed to and something that excites and invigorates him.  The two begin to spend more and more time together, until their friendship eventually becomes romantically emotional and physical.  Neither caring that their relationship would be considered taboo by most others.   \n\nMaude ultimately determines that embracing life for all it has to offer must also include accepting death as well.  Unfolding events leave Harold forced to finally make the ultimate decision of whether he wants to fully embrace the death he has obsessed over, or to embrace the life that Maude has unveiled to him.\n\nAt its core, the film is one of presenting contrasts… life and death; young and old; fullness and emptiness; color (Maude's deserted train car home) and dull (Harold's mansion home); simplicity and complexity (a daisy or a field of daisies).  The cinematography, set in and around the San Francisco area is gorgeous, and the music and costuming firmly cement the film to the nineteen-seventies.  Most of the film features original songs written and performed by Cat Stevens.  Watching this movie was like enjoying a little time-capsule of celluloid, intended to simply remind any viewer of any time period that life is precious, fleeting, and what one chooses to make of it.  It may well have been produced ahead of its time, but it has more than caught up… or we have.",

Not without its faults (Harold's antics grow tiring, some interior shots are weirdly framed, a lot of the attempts at comedy are overdone), it is buoyed by a knockout performance from Gordon, a great soundtrack from Cat Stevens, a totally original storyline, and a great vibe that can't help but make you feel really friggin' good.",

            "content": "A dark delight with a striking warmth.\n\nHal Ashby's black comedy romance drama Harold and Maude (1971) is a peculiar film with a multi-faceted style I enjoyed very much. It's very much a black comedy with morbid humor as Harold is a young man who wants to kill himself and you see him attempt various forms of faked suicides, and it's hilarious every time. John A. Alonzo shoots with a wide shot, so you can see all the suicide recreations and quirky dates Harold and Maude undertake.\n\nHal Ashby's direction deftly balances these otherwise dreary scenes into an upbeat comedy that is ultimately life affirming. Harold meets Maude, an older lady and develops a true fondness for her as she has fun with Harold and gets him to slowly start to appreciate living. There are heartfelt moments and absurd car chases to funny funerals. I was laughing at the ridiculous jokes, thinking about the existential crisis these two are having, while finding solace in their peaceful conclusion. Harold and Maude is unlike any other romantic comedy ever made.\n\nWriter Colin Higgins wrote quite a brilliant script. You get to know the estranged and absurd relationship between Harold and his indifferent and frustrated mother. Vivian Pickles is hilarious as Harold's mother Mrs. Chasen as she arranges several dates for Harold, yet she's really ignoring him. Higgins' writing lets you know Harold feels depressed and neglected by his shallow mother as she can only think of his marriage as leading to his happiness or normalcy. Bud Cort is a young and interesting actor as he looks younger than he is as Harold Parker Chasen, while also conveying Harold's inner sadness naturally. He's quite good.\n\nRuth Gordon is hilarious and delightful as the exuberant Maude. You see how she loves life and plays around with stealing cars and trees to speed down the highway, taking every opportunity to have fun like skidding around corners at top speed. She's a treat to watch as she always feels genuine and kind, if insane at all times. Editors William A. Sawyer and Edward Warschilka cut quickly for a fast pace for 91 minutes like these car chase segments. \n\nI love when Tom Skerritt's highway patrol cop stops her in disbelief and dismay. It's a funny cameo. I liked director Hal Ashby's cameo at the amusement park with his distant stare and enormous beard. Cyril Cusack cameos as an artist doing a nude painting of Maude, while Charles Tyner portrays Ashby's anti-war sentiments and those of the hippies with his gung ho for war general. As he raves about the benefits of warfare and the military, you cannot help but notice wounded veterans, including Tyner with one arm that can only salute his nation with a missing arm. I enjoyed Ellen Geer's shallow actress Sunshine with her weird performance. Isn't she just perfect for Harold? Lastly, Eric Christmas' Priest character is a riot with his disapproval and disgust for Maude..\n\nWilliam Ware Theiss' costumes look just like stylish hippie suits and patterns, which fits 1971 perfectly. Cat Stevens' gentle folk songs adorn Harold and Maude with a bittersweet warmth and a musical calm at all times. You feel Cat Stevens adding a melancholy, yet his songs also sound happy or content with life in a way. Bob Stein's make-up ensures everyone looks dead and pale, especially Harold.\n\nIn all, Harold and Maude is all you need.",

It's an odd film, there's no getting away from that, but often odd means interesting. The opening scene sees Harold seemingly hanging himself, only for us to quickly realise this is his favourite hobby, planning elaborate fake suicide attempts to shock his long suffering mother. It's an unusual past time, and clearly one that probably warrants therapy of some sort. But Harold's Mum is past making the time and effort for his issues, she persistently tries to set Harold up with various girls in a bid to imprint some sort of normality onto his life. But once Harold meets Maude, a seventy-nine year old lady who leads him on an amusing trail of mischief, all hope of a 'normal' romantic association goes out the window. Maude tries to impress upon Harold the importance of living life to the full, and their relationship is the story. It's heartwarming, weird, and very darkly amusing.",

Because both our fairly fairytale protagonists in their own ways run away from death. On the one hand, Maude with her indefatigable, insatiable, anarchistic lust for life that is really no way to live at all, too socially destructive and ontologically isolating, a rejection of humanity's fundamental need for Mitsein (\"being-with\") and a devaluation of death as just a fact of life. On the other, Harold with his pseudo-suicidal ideation, like Hamlet preferring to avoidantly act out rather than responsibly take action, his morbid curiosity a means of treating death as a perpetual fantasy that can be lived out, out lived, and thus ultimately lived without. Flip sides of the same coin, both must come to see that life and death, too, are flip sides of the same coin, that (as Heidegger puts it) \"as soon as one comes to life, they are at once old enough to die,\" so that escaping the boxes and cages that the establishment, the Man, das Man, tries to contain us in—the mechanical death camps of the holocaust, the algorithmic boxes of computer dating—means embracing the final pine box (perhaps cut from the same tree the couple plants in the forest) of the tomb.",

There are plenty of funny little scenes, like Harold's repeated (and repeated and repeated) fake suicide attempts and his mother's dry reactions to them that evoke the kind of morbid humor that would reach more mainstream success in the following decades. I agree with the criticism of one of the more pandering shots of the film, namely the 'incidental' focus on Maude's extermination camp tattoo without referencing it in dialogue that is intended to add some depth to her character by contrasting her bubbly personality, but ends up feeling unecessary. Taps into a teenage angst and rebellion that has endured to the present, and in a unique way, but is really hammered home by Gordon's caring and bright performance. (3.5/5)",

Catching this film in the cinema pre-quaratine at Tarantino's New Beverly was pure delight. The crowd was populated with faces young and old, as the subject matter of death, life and love speaks to all the sensitive souls of the world. Ashby's work is notable, because you can truly feel his lineage as an editor. The film (and other Ashby flicks) is streamlined in a way that will feel familiar to the modern thread of music video stylings where atmosphere and music often carry scenes and visual sequences. But heart is tucked in -- not paved over -- and while it's a tempered physical love affair on screen, the fullness of young Bud Court's heart is on full display. The walls we put up can always be dismantled. It's a beautiful cinematic fable that shows us it's never too late to start, living.",

This is one of the greatest, most uniquely conceived, and subtly informing films of cinema's rich history.\n\nOn a surefire course to his own self-inflicted death, Harold (Bud Cort) is an affluent, despondent young man immersed in his own head. Maude (Ruth Gordon) is an old woman, living in a railway car, yet filled with energies and a pervasive lust for life (she imagines a future incarnation in which she lives as a sunflower). What a terrific conceit to have these two counterpoints converge and give rise to each other's highly individualized character sketches. Their unlikely but deeply felt affair is set to be physically actualized on Maude's 80th birthday.\n\n\"Harold and Maude\" entered the cultural conversation through an unassuming door at the apex of the Vietnam War -- there's a sense of anti-establishment and selective ignorance of social principals lurking beneath the film's plain brown wrapper which surely explains its appeal in its day. It also accounts for its enduring growth, and status as a true cult classic. \"Harold and Maude\" is cut from a unique cloth, and to an extent to which few films can boast.",

Through his intrigue, Harold happens to meet Maude - a 79-year-old woman who embraces and lives life to the fullest. Initially, I found the film to be uninteresting, and was intrigued as to why his relationship with his mom was so dysfunctional. Over time, as his and Maude's connection grew and deepened, I started to really enjoy it. It made me think that we can truly have connections with anyone - regardless of their age or background. Written by Colin Higgins, I think that the greatest strength and weakness of the story is the concept. I enjoy that it is unique, however, it did feel to be a little far fetched in the grand scheme of things - that these are two people that would actually fall in love. Directed by Hal Ashby, I particularly enjoyed the pacing and rhythm of the scenes. Ashby ensured that if a scene needed more time - it had it, and I appreciated that. This was evident when Harold was throwing Maude her surprise birthday party. With each shot, I felt like I was hanging onto every word that each character was saying. This is also a great representation of the editors, William A. Sawyer and Edward Warschilka. John A. Alonzo, the cinematographer of the film created a color palette that consistently used cooler colors. For me, this was especially evident in the scene when Maude is stealing the tree and gets pulled over on the interstate by the cop. Overall, I would have liked for the film to delve more into Harold and Maude's relationship, as I felt like it was just barely scraping the surface, but I found myself to really enjoy it!",

There's also something interesting that happens as you watch the film, because you find that you start to become desensitized to Harold's behavior much like his own mother. I started off genuinely disturbed, and never would have thought that minutes later I'd be laughing at similar things. \n\nThe magic of Harold and Maude starts with the performance of Bud Cort. He delivers a lot of personality as Harold and somehow makes you care about a young man who has some serious issues. His character goes through a real arc in the film and you can feel it in his portrayal. Ruth Gordon provides an interesting counterpoint as Maude. Her wacky carefree attitude almost seems like it would clash with Harold. However, the two of them have a strange connection in the film and it seems to enrich both of them.\n\nWhile Harold and Maude took me completely by surprise, I was delighted how much it clicked with me. The story is off the wall, darkly humorous, and also emotional at times. There were some parts in the second half that I didn't love as much because they took things to an extreme that seemed unbelievable. At a certain point you'd wind up in jail without question. I suppose there's a level of whimsy in the film and someone could ignore the illogical, but that aspect didn't quite work for me. I also struggled a bit with the ending, because it was, well let's just say...disappointing. Still the movie was funny and overall a winner.",

Very free spirited and free loving, peace and love - all that stuff. Also fights for what's right. Regardless wether he killed himself in the car crash or not, he seems a lot happier as if he's freed himself from the sadness and depression he once knew. My theory is that he did in fact kill himself, or rather his old miserable self and can now live freely and joyfully with Maude at his side because of what Maude taught him.\n\nSo darkly comedic in nature. One of the most quirky and odd dark comedies out there. This movie has quite the beautiful message though. You have to live life and see the beauty in everything. Harold wants to end his life yet he has his whole life ahead of him whereas Maude wants to live life to its fullest yet has a couple of days left to live. Maude was exactly what Harold needed in his life. She turned it around for him. \n\nThere's definitely no other movie quite like this one.

The film centers on a unique relationship between a young teen, Harold, who's obsessed with death and an elderly woman, Maude, who is overjoyed with life. They are brought together by their mutual affection for funerals where Harold wallows in the grief and Maude lightens the mood. The two then become inseparable as they bring out the best in one another and go on a myriad of insane adventures with Maude truly being one of the most unpredictable characters I've ever seen, literally stealing cars at a whim and disregarding every law in the book. The film's style can only be described as Wes Anderson meets the Addams Family, and this film has inspired many filmmakers today to produce off-beat and quirky cinema. One of the more hilarious aspects of the film is Harold's constant torturing of his mother and the girls she tries to set him up with where he performs fake, but realistic-looking suicides, that really layer the film's creativity and they always made me laugh. As the film goes along, Harold and Maude's relationship grows more romantic as they are the only two people who understand one another and this is obviously the film's most controversial area. I went into this film with an open-mind, much like I did with the film, Her, and I applaud this movie for taking such a mature look at sexuality, regardless of the age-gap, and while it is pretty wrong for an 80 year-old woman to be having intercourse with a 16 year-old kid, the psychology between them makes it more than believable. This is a very special film that digs deep into the psyche of the two main characters and as we learn more about their pasts, we become deeply attached to both with Harold's, wiser-than-his-years maturity, and Maude's larger-than-life spunk. It's a challenging film that can be analyzed to no end, and it's a film I will never forget due to the incredible writing, emotional connection, and fantastic, upbeat soundtrack!",

I think it's an original, special, quirky movie with good performances and interesting screenwriting, but that's all it is.\nLike the crititics consensus states: Hal Ashby's comedy is too dark and twisted for some, and occasionally oversteps its bounds, but there's no denying the film's warm humor and big heart.\nWhich is something i fully concur with.\n\nI dont love Harold and Maude, nor do i hate it. I think it's fine entertainment, and it will go down in history that this is one of the most original movies in the ''unconventional friendships'' sub-genre.",

Harold is a wealthy young man who has an unhealthy fascination with suicide and death who falls in love with an eccentric 79 year old, Maude, who he meets at a funeral. Maude is a force of nature who cares little for the norms of society. She's flouts the law and creates a kind of carefree havoc wherever she goes. The strength of this movie are the two central performances by Bud Curt and Ruth Gordon who is especially enchanting. This is a likeable oddball comedy romance but there's not really much exploration of why Harold is the way he is which leaves a few too many questions.",

            "content": "A comedy cult classic with an off the wall premise, Harold and Maude sounded like a look into a different generation of comedy.\n\nHarold and Maude serves as Hal Ashby's contribution to the massive change cinematic history took in 1971. In a year where depictions of violence and sexuality were changed at the hands of such classics as The French Connection, A Clockwork Orange and Last Tango in Paris, Harold and Maude is an example far more tame in some areas and yet shocking in others. It is not difficult to determine where the innovations in Harold and Maude come from. Considering that the intro depicts its titular character Harold Chasen putting his neck in a noose and simulating suicide while his mother doesn't even flinch, the approach to death taken by Hal Ashby is one which is still very strange in the modern day. This is the first sign of Harold and Maude's most distinctive comedic style which proves to come from all kinds of unexpected directions over the course of the tale.\nThe story depicts a young man obsessed with death finding value in his existence through a developing relationship with a woman many decades older. Rather than having an old character learn from someone young, the roles are reversed for the sake of Harold and Maude which is a perfect use of the context in which it war produced. Coming from the counterculture era, Harold and Maude captures a time when contemporary society was condemned to an era of mistrust and nihilism which was heavily reflected in youth culture. To create a more positive sense of energy, the story looks back to a time when people fought through two world wars and still managed to come out with an optimistic look on life. The beautiful sense of life in the film and touching characters ensure that this feeling has been maintained in the decades since, ensuring that Harold and Maude has won the battle of age even if its humour is not precisely as shocking anymore.\nFor such an unconventional film, Harold and Maude is a very easy one to watch. Walking a sensible balance between dark comedy and sentimentality, Harold and Maude is a film about characters and not so much about story. Without attempting to be the most in-depth material, Harold and Maude is a film which lets everything naturally develop on its own so that the two titular characters are the primary focus of every source of the film's meanings, messages and humour. The story around Harold and Maude can be dull when it gets sidetracked away from the relationship between its titular characters, but it maintains enough focus to keep things entertaining and never overstays its welcome due to a meagre 91 minute running time.\nAs a romantic comedy, Harold and Maude is very removed from the conventions of the genre while diverting some of its familiar points into a more refreshing product. Since the plot focuses on the developing romantic relationship between a young man in his 20's and a 79 year old woman, it is the furthest thing from a familiar relationship depicted on film. Yet this concept is not wasted on strictly gags or taken too seriously. Unlike countless other romantic comedies, Harold and Maude is not a tale of cheesy interactions and dramatic conflicts between its main two characters, rather making an effort to be an existential drama amid such a zany plot. Hal Ashby walks a tricky line with this ambition and does not always hit his mark in achieving the most entertaining film, but the themes and subtext of Harold and Maude are always engaging while the unpredictable jokes of the film were a welcome surprise. Though Harold and Maude was a rather brief film, it did pose a lot of questions about love, life and death which left me thinking by the end of it after having some laughs along the way.\nOne of the most beautiful things about Harold and Maude is its soundtrack. In a similar style to Mike Nichols' The Graduate (1967), Harold and Maude has a soundtrack full of gentle acoustic pieces which set a somewhat bittersweet atmosphere consistently. As a fan of the BBC sitcom Extras (2005-2007), I was particularly favourable of Cat Stevens' contribution of the song \"Tea for the Tillerman\". The work of Cat Stevens on Harold and Maude is beautifully atmospheric and really captures the intended spirit of finding the natural beauty in life.\nAnd to reach out to the human side of viewers, Harold and Maude has a perfect cast.\nRuth Gordon takes on the role of Maude, a sweet old woman with a lot of wisdom to offer. In a brilliant contrast to her Academy Award winning role as the dark and twisted Minnie Castevet in Rosemary's Baby (1968), Dame Marjorie \"Maude\" Chardin is the most lovable and friendly character you could think of. Yet she is not a shallow archetype of sweetness, she is a genuinely intelligent and very likable character who is so packed with spirit that she transcends her physical age. This means viewers can easily get a sense as to why Harold Parker Chasen falls in love with her. There is a lot the character has to share with the world, and the fact that Ruth Gordon is the one responsible for bonding her with viewers everywhere is a perfect decision. Her free spirit is so admirable because it seems so real, and with Ruth Gordon seizing the role with the same passion Maude uses to sieze life to its fullest every day, the resulting character is brilliant. Ruth Gordon is a perfect lead for Harold and Maude who brings light into the dark nature of the film's beginning and ensures the story develops well enough so that the light shines out to viewers.\nBud Cort is also a brilliant cast member. Leading the film as Harold, Bud Cort is able to brilliantly capture the lost and hopeless nature of youth. It is something viewers can easily sympathize with because it is the kind of darkness many viewers have had to experience in life, as is the surrounding mystery of death. Bud Cort clearly knows the feeling all too well and provides a darkly comic character for the film whom he later develops as the dramatic material progresses. From there, he peels off layers of the character and shows viewers the tender soul underneath with raw and realistic emotion he gets from his interactions with Ruth Gordon. She manages to bring out the best in him and he really works to reach out to her, so the chemistry ends up being a strong two-way streak. Bud Cort embraces the dark comedy and serious drama of the story with no problem balancing the two, making the material seem all the more organic despite strange nature. Everything comes naturally to him which just goes to show the extent of his charms in the face of either comedy or drama, so Bud Cort shines out as a a memorable young star for Harold and Maude.\n\nSo Harold and Maude may be brief without having too much happen within its plot, but it is both funny and touching with an insightful script, brilliant performances and an unforgettable soundtrack.",

The idea of a wacky, exuberant free spirit woman bringing new life to a guy with emotional issues is hardly original ... and wasn't in 1971.  There were dozens of movies made around this same theme at the time.  The idea of the man being young and the woman being old was certainly original. but that's really where the originality stops.  Characters like Maude tend to confuse self-centered energy with a kid of life spirit, and she plays that way to me.  I don't believe that she ever really stops thinking about herself long enough to truly care about Harold, and the ending really confirms that feeling for me.",

Lovers (sickening thoughts were burrowed in my skull)? But this film was a surprise to what I had originally expected.\n\nThe part of what I liked about this film may have been its message. Beyond the affection the two have for one another, you can see Harold and Maude are stark opposites. Harold is depressing and death obsessed. Maude is all about living life to the fullest. While the message is hammered home quite a few times, it still is something that tends to slip the brain. The idea (to me) is to live life to its extent and to not ponder about death that often. Before Maude, Harold himself looked dead and non-responsive. Again, I have proven to myself that I am probably attached more to an interesting character than a story. I'm not death obsessed, but there are definitely times where I question why I live. There are times where I'm floating out there where I'm not me as Cat Stevens would probably put it (loved the music would probably buy a soundtrack to this film). \n\nThere's a point where Maude explains that everyone is individualistic like the daisies in a field, but people group themselves as being the same as each other when all the flowers are different/unique. Well, here's to becoming that individualist.",

After watching it, I can agree with both of these statements. Harold and Maude is a movie that is melancholic, hilarious, and happy all at the same time, and each part works together to make an unforgettable story. Balancing jokes about lighting yourself on fire, serious acknowledgement of the holocaust, and a cheerful soundtrack by Cat Stevens is no easy task, but this film does it expertly, mainly due to its large heart that it proudly wears on its sleeve. Similar to this balance, the tale told here is probably one of the best written in cinema. Lots of movies fall into the hole of having random twists show up out of nowhere or the equally dangerous trap of ignoring facts and throwing in new ones at the same time, but the script put out here leaps over those failings and delivers something both complex and simple, both in the best way. Almost everything that happens in the movie is foreshadowed or mentioned in some way, even a couple times in a seemingly throw away gag, and once you finish it you'll realize that what shocked you was coming a mile away, you just didn't realize the sings, much like the characters in the movie. If that's not a sign of good film making I don't know what is. In the end, while Hal Ashby could have take the easy way out and made an overly sentimental drama or a cruel comedy, he followed the road less traveled, crafting a gem that takes you through the ups and downs of life, and even after sadness leaves you with a smile on your face with an invaluable piece of knowledge. People, places, and things may come and go, but the lessons we learn from them and the moments we shared stay with us forever.",

The story of a death obsessed, fake suicide staging, depressed young    man and a fun loving old woman with an impulsive and positive outlook on the world and their blossoming friendship. It's a sometimes darkly comical and yet very gentle, very warm film.",

            "content": "Harold and Maude (1971) is a film you will either site for changing your life, or you will go on for hours about how awful it was. There is seldom an in between. This is a film that is either inspiring or depressing, all depending completely on your own personal interpretation. Between the vague symbolism and the dramatic shifts between death imagery and life imagery, many are left unsure what to think. One thing is for sure, however: after watching Harold and Maude, you will be left shocked, and your overall opinion of this film will not be a quiet one. \n\tBud Cort plays the lanky, raven-haired, deep-voiced and baby-faced Harold Chasen. Discontented with his wealthy lifestyle, by the beginning of the film, Harold has committed suicide 15 times -- but that's just a \"rough estimate.\" \"And were they all for your mother's uh, benefit?\" Harold's shrink asks. The relationship between Harold and his mother is one that has been covered in fake blood and silicone limbs. The opening sequence of the film is that of Harold swinging from a noose, with his apathetic mother talking on the phone in front of him. This type of scenario is not uncommon, throughout this story she is commonly seen turning up \n\nher nose at, or just blissfully ignoring, Harold's staged suicides. \n\tWhen asked what he does for fun, Harold answers truthfully, \"I go to funerals.\" It is at one of these funerals that he meets a braid-wearing, free spirited seventy-nine year old woman named Dame Marjorie Charden (but you can call her Maude). Harold's first encounter with this strange old woman is brief, but soon she approaches him and offers him licorice. Their friendship only strengthens from there. He visits Maude's house repeatedly throughout the film, gazing at self portraits and drinking oat straw tea. Their relationship becomes much more than just friendship, however, to the dismay of Harold's family.\n\tA common criticism of Maude's character (played by the lovable and sassy Ruth Gordon) is that she is a \"manic pixie dream girl\" (a woman who enters a film for the sole purpose of benefitting the male character). While this is ultimately true, I don't believe the concept of Maude's character to be quite that shallow. Maude is a meaningful and thought provoking character. A close look at her character would tell the viewer that she has been controlled by the possibility of death her whole life, and now wants to live life to the fullest. \"Everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves sometimes. You can't let the world judge you too much!\" she jokes in one scene. Maude is certainly no side character, and to write her off as such, would be to miss the point of the film completely. \n\tThis film is exceptionally cast. The portrayal of Harold's character is absolutely spot-on, and I genuinely believe that not a single other person in this world could have done it better. Cort delivers every witty punch line with a dead straight face and a signature deep monotonous voice. Even when breaking the fourth wall, it doesn't at all come across as cheesy or unnecessary. This isn't at all like his previous film Brewster McCloud, where his character seems void of a personality and any depth whatsoever. Cort has never played a character better suited for his acting skill! By the end of Harold and Maude, you will begin to believe that he truly is Harold Chasen.\n\tMy own personal favorite aspect of the movie is the symbolism, often completely missed by viewers. The symbolism can completely change the meaning of the film from a dark comedy about a strange relationship, to a film about existentialism and living life to the fullest. Each moment in the movie is a necessary one, and every last detail has been clearly thought out. Everything from the color of the umbrellas at a funeral, to the flowers in the cemetery, to a seemingly random marching band, means something incredibly deep. Be careful not to blink -- everything in this film is some form of foreshadowing. Expect to need to watch it a few times. \n\tOne scene in particular is rich with symbolism and in many ways, summarizes the entire movie. Both Maude and Harold are sitting amongst a field of flowers near a cemetery (live versus death imagery). Maude tells Harold that she would like to be a sunflower. \"They're so tall and simple. What flower would you like to be, Harold?\" she asks. Harold replies that he would like to be a daisy because they're supposedly all the same. Maude seems concerned with his reply. \"Oh but they're not [all the same]! See, some are taller, some are fatter. Some go to the left, some to the right. Some are even missing some petals! All kind of observable differences. You see, I feel much of the world's sorrow comes from people who are this, but allow themselves to be treated as that!\" Maude says. This scene speaks to me on many levels, and never ceases to inspire me endlessly.\n\tI am not the only one who has been inspired by Harold and Maude. My first experience with this film was through a 'History of the Motion Picture' class in high school. The teacher of this class introduced the film as his \"all-time favorite piece of cinema\" and continued to tell us about how this film alone inspired him to get up and leave for New Zealand, and hitch hike for months. This film is a life-changer; no exaggeration necessary.\n\tUnfortunately this film is seldom shown in theaters. Even less often are DVDs sold in stores. In order to purchase or rent this film, you must seek online sources. However, undoubtedly, Harold and Maude is worth every penny you will pay, and the time you will wait for shipping and handling.\n\tFrom the exceptional and thought provoking symbolism, to the unexpected plot, and the perfect cast, this movie is absolutely the best film I have seen. Harold and Maude means so much to so many people around the world. I believe the word \"perfect\" to be a very strong word, but I am confident that Harold and Maude is truly a piece of perfect cinema. If it doesn't haunt the back of your mind for weeks, or completely change your life, you might just need to watch it again... and again, and again.",

I have to admit I was a bit wary of this film at first bc of the age difference and disturbing suicide scenes, but u have to take this film with a grain of salt-its corky. The age difference was weird, although u see it in Hollywood in other films but gender roles reversed. The main messages were wonderful-Live life to the fullest, embrace ur uniqueness, and love who u want to. That police chase scene was comedic genius! I just loved Maudes character who was such a breath of fresh air in a sea of young cookie cutter beautiful actresses. Hello Hollywood casting agents: more Maudes and less bimbos please. She didn't need plastic surgery to showcase her youthfulness or beauty. Why aren't there more roles like this for women? Maudes acting was impeccable. Def recommend this movie!",
