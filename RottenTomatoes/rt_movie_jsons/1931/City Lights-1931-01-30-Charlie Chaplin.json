In a time when talking pictures were becoming all the rage, he fought to keep this film silent, and I think that's one of the reasons it stands out among the rest. The story may be considered silly or simple to the modern viewer, but this film has humor, it has heart, and it has drama. Even the acting, while intentionally hokey most of the time, brings real emotion in the end. City Lights is more than just a spectacularly choreographed boxing scene, it's a masterpiece of silent cinema.",

This is the 3rd film of Chaplin's I've seen and I don't regularly rate movies higher than an 8 on IMDb but there you have it.

This is another film that is a pleasure to watch and is timeless in every possible way. As the talkies were exploding in Hollywood and nearly everyone was making the switch, Chaplin was nearly done with City Lights and after great debate decided to finish it. Thank God he did though, as this is one of his greatest achievements, arguably his best, and a masterpiece of the Silent era! City Lights delivers in all the key areas and provides Chaplin's usual touch of humanity and his loveable demeanor coupled with his impeccable timing and hilarious slapstick. Currently sitting at #11 on the current American Film Institute Top 100 Films of the past 100 years, City Lights earns that spot by leaps and bounds. What an amazing work by one of film's most talented Director/Actors. If you haven't seen it you are missing out on a gem and need to do so as soon as possible!",

The third act, particularly the boxing scene, was flawless, but for more than half the movie I felt the scenes weren't blending into each other very well and (especially in the first act) he was milking the decent jokes through bald repetition. The length of the boxing sequence really saves the movie as that whole part is perfect from start to finish and it taking up a significant amount of the runtime was good. It does make it rather difficult to justify AFI naming this the #1 rom-com though as the whole thing is like 5% romance at best.",

The film is the truest evocation ever envisioned of everything embodied within the term \"sublime,\" all distilled and purified by the silent film medium to a point of perfect simplicity. The emotions here are so frankly and honestly portrayed in pantomimic fashion that sentimental moments hit us straight in the heart, leaving us laughing and weeping in equal measure. Never before have I witnessed a spectacle that so readily accesses my emotions, ever astounding me with a vision of human endeavor that transmutes every painful and funny moment into a thing of truly rare beauty. To be moved by the little tramp is to recognize his innocence in all of us, enticed by the purity of his comic struggles to briefly set aside the cynicism that can so quickly reduce us to a tired and jaded condition. \"City Lights\" is nothing less than quintessential Chaplin, offering up as complete a picture of his brilliance as one could ever hope for.",

This sweet but comic slapstick classic shows Chaplin deceiving a blind flower girl to gain her love.  It is a fun movie and a valuable one.  If you've never seen a silent film, this is the one to see.  It teaches the lessons that appearances can be deceptive and a man with nothing to his name can be as honorable as any millionaire.\n\nAs an actor, Chaplin is a marvel, conveying astonishing emotional depth through the silent antics of his little tramp.  As a director, he demonstrates an impeccable sense of timing with difficult, gracefully choreographed stunts.  The entire family may bust a collective gut watching him skitter across a slippery dance floor, or outmaneuver an imposing boxing opponent, but then be rendered speechless by the poignant ending.  To blink while watching is to miss something.  Like Modern Times, another masterpiece, this film touches on some sensitive issues but doesn't become weighed down by them.  A morose drunk man makes repeated suicide attempts, although the audience never feels the danger.  \n\nThis was a thumb in the eye to talkies by Chaplin and is perhaps his best film ever.",

A classic blend of slapstick and pathos, the kind that The Tramp character was always associated with, I did laugh a number of times, but I also spent significant periods waiting for something significant to happen. It's obvious how talented Chaplin was, and he dedicated himself fully to his craft, and while the material he comes up with is usually amusing, he seems to have trouble filling out an entire film. Some scenes, including the prelude to the boxing match, and the match itself, go on for much longer than they should, and just start repeating the same jokes to diminishing effect. It's a fun story, and The Tramp's hapless antics are always bolstered by the fact that he is, in essence, always trying to do good, never hurts anyone out of malice, and ultimately is just trying to get by in a difficult world. Maybe Chaplin's style of comedy isn't to my taste, but I certainly appreciate how much he did for the world of Cinema at large, and there's certainly a lot of elements to recommend. Not to everyone's taste, but it's still a landmark film that any movie buff should see at least once.",

            "content": "A deliriously fun slapstick from the silent film era!\n\nCharlie Chaplin's romantic comedy-drama City Lights (1931) has a lot of heart for such an early picture. Chaplin's direction is relentlessly fast paced with constant jokes and visual gags flying at you. Even in black and white, without any voices, you can still laugh along with this delightful comedy classic. City Lights will surely entertain anyone of any age as great slapstick can get laughter out of any viewer. Seeing Charlie Chaplin don his Tramp outfit and character is such a blast. You like this silly man and root for his romantic quest to end up nicely. Virginia Cherrill is enchanting as A Blind Girl with her forlorn looks and eyes displaying longing for someone who loves her. She's natural and moving in an iconic role.\n\nChaplin has interesting ideas as he simultaneously critiques the ultra rich with their selfish ways, empathizes with the poor Tramp on the street, as well as sympathizing with A Blind Girl's struggle to pay the rent by selling a few flowers. Charlie Chaplin, Harry Crocker, and Harry Clive's writing beautifully blends effortless slapstick comedy, biting satire against the wealthy, and sweet romance with two out of luck people.\n\nCharlie Chaplin and Willard Nico's editing is super quickly cut, with sharp edits for instant jokes from all the nonsense herein. City Lights is a brisk 87 minutes, especially with Chaplin and Nico's sped up footage. Gordon Pollock and Roland Totheroh's cinematography is very playful with perspectives and wide shots that let you think it's all real. They hide most of the wires and setups in the room for all the slapstick gags with Chaplin running around everywhere. Charles D. Hall's set decoration is realistic and also helps hide visual gags before they happen. \n\nCharlie Chaplin and Arthur Johnston's score is lovely. They compose music that suits the ridiculous slapstick as well as the heavy romance drama scenes with the girl. Your heart swells with the Tramp due to their rising melodies and thunderous compositions. City Lights' score sounds as modern and dreamy as any refined movie music.\n\nIn all, City Lights is still worth seeking out. I highly recommend The Criterion Collection's restoration on blu-ray as it has never looked better.",

I would say out of the movies I have seen so far, my personal favorite is \"Modern Times.\" Although at this point in time I have only seen three of them, so as I explore more classics, that could always change, I would say this movie is almost as good as that one.

            "content": "Real Rating: 83.5/100\nThis is my 3rd favourite film of Chaplin's. Modern Times and the Great Dictator, rank higher for me personally. Though to the man himself, this is his favourite film and Welles, Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Woody Allen agree. It is strange though that Chaplin's 3 greatest works came after he was deemed obsolete, but being the artistic Luddite, he was. He pushed forward and did not allow modern technology to steal his craftsmanship. In a way, you must applaud that, but at the same time from a critical analysis standpoint, you must also detract marks for it. For is it genius? Or a has-been doing their best to cling on to a world that has moved beyond them?\nBE: With a Chaplin film you have to ask yourself can you really comment on the directing. Given that he does a large percentage of the workload himself, it would be like applauding Michelangelo's overseeing of the Sistine Chapel rather than the painting itself. The editing is decent, and the transitions move swiftly and give a sense of speed and the story with what limited cinematography we have for the time.\n\nW: The writing is simple but effective. Some claim that the pathos as they put it is limiting the film and not allowing it to be as good as it can be. However, we have seen the Tramp 12 times prior to this, and this is the last outing. Giving this comedic character a sense of compassion and sympathy at this stage is where the story should progress. Rather than leaving it in the purely farcical realm. We have completeness and sadness that often appears in great comedy, and from the very first scene with the Tramp and the blind girl, we have a pleasant mix of longing with pratfall comedy.\n\nC: It is 1931, and Fritz Arno Wagner is continuing to put Hollywood cinematography to shame. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Chaplin has brought along his old standby in Roland Totheroh, and he provides the standard for a Chaplin outing. The angles on some shots are nice, and some of the shadow work is pleasant, but nothing outstanding.\n\nA: At the beginning of the film, it says it is in pantomime, which implies over the top acting and with subtly and nuance removed from the piece. Which would be fine, save for the fact that it does have these things due to the previously mentioned pathos. Which forces me to be meaner on some of the more weak acting exhibited by the rest of the crew. Chaplin is excellent and very few people have such command of body language as he. The blind girl did not always feel blind, but we are still in the early days of cinema, so it is slightly excusable.\u00a0\n\nS: The opening of the film is annoying in terms of sound. We have mumbled audio from several characters, and then the Tramp appears and then silence. Which seems to imply yes films have dialogue now but let us enjoy this nostalgic throwback. Which is an excellent way of presenting the film, but in terms of audio quality, it is weak, and we could have had that same effect while presenting clear audio to the viewer. The rest is standard silent film fare.\n\nPD: The sets are sets of the era, and they took effort, but nothing stands out, especially when one knows what is coming in the 1930s in regards to set design.\n\nBA: Costume design is again very Hollywood and of the era. Nothing makes it feel all that special save for the Tramp himself.\n\nEVO: Thoroughly enjoying and while the comedy is not on par with the circus or modern times. It offers the viewer so much more and allows us to see how romantic films should be done. I kid you not. Look at most of the great romantic movies, and you will find that the romance in the film is left in the background and only adds to the overall work. Like a lovely sauce over a delicious meal. Rather than your standard romantic movie which is like eating a 15 kg bag of marshmallows in a single sitting.",

The movie is charming and fun that is a textbook showcase of slapstick and excellent showcase of a silent movie movie.\n\tThe slapstick is amazing and can be studied to see how to do proper slapstick. The boxing scene is iconic and plays out like a excelant choreographed dance. The opening scene is also a wonderful showcase of Champlin's skills in slapstick and is a fun way to start the film off and gives us the mood. The story as a whole is charming and funny. But also deals with some serious issues in a compelling way while not completely making fun of them, like suiside and being poor. The relationship between the Tramp and the drunk Millionaire, played by Harry Myers, is one way this film deals with the poor status of men. Tramp is very poor and he makes friends with a Millionaire after he says the mans live from suiside. The film shows us how even the man with a lot of money needs to be saved from taking his own life, which one would most likely only due if there are unhappy with life which also shows us how having money in this world isn't everything. Then there is the build up between the relationship of the Tramp and the Blind Girl, played by Virginia Cherrill, is cute and builds to an interaction that does not fail to spark multiple emotions. This is really thanks to the phenomenal acting done by Champlin and Cherrill. The intereaction im talking about is the ending when the Blind Girl finally sees the Tramp for the first time in the film when the whole film she believes the Tramp to be a rich man when he is not. The subtle change that Champlin has from excitement when he finally finds his love to worry and embarrassed when he realizes that she is actually seeing him. This is played wonderfully by Charrills character who has this slow realization of her own about Tramp and how he was the one who took care of her for so long. These two plays with our emotions; making us feel anxious for their first interaction, to embarrassed for Champlin, hopeful for their future, all in a matter of seconds with no dialogue and very little title cards. Along with the amazing acting the music also is just as amazing. It plays along with the story as a whole. Being upbeat and fun during the best slapstick parts of the movie. While also being sad and down during the times when the Tramp is down on his luck or feeling low. \n\tCity Lights is an excellent film that plays with ideas of how you status in society or how much money you have doesn't make you a good or bad person. Or make your life any easier. It is classic ideals that Champlin showcases in his other films but this one is one of his masterpieces. City Lights might be Charlie Champlins best film of his career.",

City lights came out at the end of an era as sound was being introduced in the next few years, It shows how good silent films can be with Charlie Chaplin going all in, in this hilarious comedy the slap stick comedy is so outrageous and goofy it still makes audiences laugh. For a comedy I was very surprised to find out that this movie had a romantic relationship between the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) and Blind Girl (Virginia Cherrill). This film does so good with the characters, Chaplin and Cherrill have chemistry that makes you want them to end up with each other at the end of the movie. I was also very surprised with a slapstick comedy like this that it was able to have so much heart, that makes this film so much more than just random sequences with plenty of jokes, by the end we find out that it was a romantic story between a blind woman and the Tramp. This film Has so much going for it and still holds up to this day.",

Going into it, I honestly wasn't very hopeful as I had never seen myself enjoying a silent film as movies today rely so heavily on sound that I almost stubbornly didn't believe it could be down otherwise. Needless to say, I can happily admit that I was terribly wrong about silent films, \n\nCity Lights captured me in a way I didn't realize ever could during a movie. The lack of audio almost brought me into the movie MORE because it then needed more of my attention. \n\nChaplin's performance is nothing short of masterful. What is is capable of doing through actions is uncanny. His performance in this movie puts nearly all modern day acting to shame. The way Chaplin is able to grab at the audience's various emotions is so impressive. There were parts in this film where I laughed, where I smiled, where I felt sorry for the character, and where I felt awful for him. Modern day movies even struggle with that and the fact that Chaplin did this all while only using his face and actions leaves me speechless.\n\nChaplin's way of moviemaking is so inspiring. I believe he revolutionized the business. Directly after watching City Lights all I wanted to do was go grab a camera and start shooting a silent film of my own. \n\nOverall, this movie blew me away. The fact that I walked into it disliking silent films, then walking out in love with it, I think that speaks massive volumes to the level of excellence this film has.",

            "content": "City Lights was overall a good movie for what was accessible to film makers at the time.  Since movies were just being made at that time, there was no dialog, you really had to flex your creative mind to try and get your message out to the audience.  This was utilized by Chaplin with both music, (non-diegetic) and his over the top actions he used.  One example I heard when the soundtrack really set the tone of the scene was when Chaplin first realized the lady selling flowers was blind, he put two and two together and the music slowed, it turned almost empathetic and softer, so the audience would feel what Charlie felt in that scene.  There was no need for words or any text cards.  The actions also helped move the plot of the story, since there weren't going to be any jokes being told, again, this was Charlie really needing to think about how he was going to progress the story while also making the viewers laugh.  So slapstick comedy was the answer to that, and it worked.  Even today I still laugh at the silly gags he uses to entertain, it's simple and effective, people like seeing others get slightly hurt or someone making a dumb decision.  But what really makes it believable and amazing was that these effects all had to be \"real\", there was no post production editing, no special effects to hide the stunt, the actors had to do it themselves, and I think everyone can agree that practical effects look better than any CGI effects.  So in conclusion, Chaplin was able to make a timeless film with no real speaking, but told compelling story, all while making us laugh along the way and really look at the stunts differently.",

I found his style thoroughly entertaining throughout the movie and it constantly reminded me of recent comedy movies. It shows the profound impact Chaplin had on comedy. I think what stuck with me the most was how the wealthy man would treat the tramp, played by Chaplin, like a close friend he had known for years when he was drunk, but when he sobered up in the morning it was like he had never met Chaplin before. It was almost like Chaplin was his drunken mistake that he kept making, and I found this humorous because I could relate to it! It relates the whole idea that people do things when they're drunk that they'd never dream of doing when they're sober and Chaplin does an immense job of showing the confusion and regret the wealthy man feels, but then the repeated commitment to making that same mistake when he's drunk. Chaplin does such a great job at relating to his audience by conveying human emotion. His writing makes you feel the emotions of the characters in situations you might find yourself in and that is what makes it so funny. It's almost like \"been there done that,\" and because it's so clear what the characters are feeling, you don't need many text cards. The lack of text was intentional because seeing these situations without context but still completely understanding the emotions and thoughts of his characters was funny in itself, and trying to make humor through conversations in silent movies takes away some of the humor as the audience has to read each text card. Chaplin understood this and did a fantastic job showing emotion that did not need context. This is what makes City Lights, and his other films, classics, not just in comedy, but in all cinema.",

This is how the film travels making sure that both of them are present at once.\n\nCity Lights\n\nCharlie Chaplin's boxing match is not a serious match. I know that's obvious. But it is not. Not expected. At the back your thoughts, you are always waiting to get things serious. Gritty. Bloody. Brutal. Intense. And it is these films that makes us expect these things from a genre as such. Not even touching the Rocky milestone, I am just playing around Raging Bull by Martin Scorsese and Battling Butler by Michel Keaton- someone from Charlie's days itself. They've all tried to plaster the sincerity of that job on screen. You can joke around, fool around as much as you like but that sport is respected with a jarring punch when the time comes.\n\nNot to say that Charlie doesn't respect it. His method of living up to that \"dutiful\" objective is somewhat different. Nay, not different. Mature. Ahead of time. He doesn't pay homage to those heavy lifters by putting them in the ring, but does it so elegantly in the dressing room. From hard work to the stakes that are played every night on the screen, everything is mocked or more accurately notified in Charlie's dictionary. There is a sense of pride in carrying that note.\n\nAnd maybe that is why he has crafted such an empathetic and a low key character in the rest of the screen time. He is wreck but an adoptable one. Another thing that makes this film incredibly different than the others is the jokes. All the jokes are an elaborative comic sketches that takes energy along with time for it to work, from you. And then there is the end of the tunnel in the City Lights. A purely unconditional and innocent act that penetrates your emotion as that good old symbol of love arrow does. The birds fly and sing by merrily.",

The sidetracks are all great, of course - The Tramp and a late replacement swinging for the fences in the boxing ring, all manner of drunken hijinx in a ritzy club on New Year's Eve, slapstick encounters with a newly-unveiled statue before an outraged audience - but it doesn't get quite as deep under the skin as Chaplin's masterpieces. That he doesn't share a wealth of chemistry with his leading lady, Virginia Cherrill (who endured a contentious relationship with the star during production), isn't so much to blame as their too-swift courtship and her disappearance during the second act. We never really get a chance to grow into loving them as a couple, though their sweet parting shot serves as proof that such spoils were within reach. Stuffed with ideas and ingenuity, City Lights still makes for an endearing, if scatter-brained, early romantic comedy.",

Charlie Chaplin is a great comedy performer and here his talents for physical comedy are showcased well.\n\nThat being said I did feel like the comedy was overdone at times.  There were occasions where the same joke was repeated again and again and I got a little bored.  I also didn't find the film entirely engaging.

Of course whenever I put into perspective how this movie was one of the original originals and was one of the pioneers for the romantic comedy genre, it certainly became a bit more interesting. Charlie Chaplin, playing his famous role the Tramp, will keep you laughing and grinning, as well as feeling all warm and fuzzy on the inside. The music score of City Lights is in my opinion the highlight of the whole movie for it is what gives emotion to it and what really makes it come to life. City Lights is definitely a must watch for any person, but especially those who would like to take a journey to the past and get lost in another time.",

That allowed me to make some snap judgments based on the singular work I've seen from each of them. While Buster Keaton impressed me tremendously with his eye for shot selection and stunt work in The General, Charlie Chaplin seems to have a much stronger eye for comedic staging and story-telling in City Lights. I was so amazed at how much I was laughing at a film with some of the classic gags I've already seen copied by countless other film-makers in the future. Clearly the imitators never proved to be quite as effective at this stuff as Chaplin, who did it first. I also loved how detailed this story was, and yet I followed it all the way through without much dialogue at all. In fact I was so interested in the story and connected to the characters that my eyes actually started to well up at the end. I'm surprised to say it, but I genuinely loved this movie. There were a few gags that got a little tedious because they dragged on a bit longer and were more repetitive than they needed to be, but in a strange way, sometimes the repetition ended up making me laugh more. I'll admit that, since it's silent, I'm less likely to watch it again in the future. However I'm absolutely delighted that I've seen City Lights, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",

It is in the opinion of not just myself, but Woody Allen, Andrei Tarkovsky and even Chaplin himself that City Lights reigns supreme. Here Chaplin tells a sentimental story about a tramp who falls in love with a blind girl, but does it so brilliantly that you don't care about the clich\u00e9. The tramp's trademark brandy-legged slapsticks are in full stock here, courtesy of his tumultuous friendship with a generous when drunk/parsimonious when sober millionaire as well as the most iconic boxing match in cinema history. Unlike his other films there is no social commentary hidden under the goofball antics. Underneath it all is just a love story, albeit one so beguiling and genuine that even time cannot diminish. Never has the gift of a flower brought a stronger spell of the happy-cries. Orsen Welles went so far as to call City Lights the best film ever, and are you really going to argue with Welley?",

            "content": "I will watch anything made by Charlie Chaplin, and City Lights was one of his most critically acclaimed works so it was an absolute must-see in my books.\n\nCity Lights was a bold move on behalf of Charlie Chaplin because 1929 was a time when silent films were descending in popularity since \"talkies\" were beginning to emerge. And building an entire film on silent slapstick gags and romantic comedy sounds like a challenge. But it is a well known fact that Charlie Chaplin is one of history's greatest comedians and his tramp character is undeniably hilarious, and well enough he manages to carry City Lights from start to finish.\nCity Lights has the issues that come with a silent film battling age, such as the fact that its gags have less effect now than they did upon the original release of the film in 1931. But an 83 year age battle is a hard thing to win, so City Lights has to be appreciated for the assets which made it original in its own time as well as the kind of relevance it has today.\nIn a generation where romantic comedies are mostly built on generic plots which go in repeated directions and formulaic paths, it is refreshing to look as far back as City Lights to see what was defined as romantic comedy in the age of 1931 and to see the genius mind of Charlie Chaplin at work as the writer, director, producer and star. City Lights is essentially Charlie Chaplin's own Citizen Kane and is an ambitious step forward on behalf of him. Thanks to his dedication to seeing that the film ends up succeeding, Charlie Chaplin implements in a perfect understanding of everything that audiences would demand of him and the true best that he has to offer, and thanks to that he gives it a perfect guidance to success, crafting a nice story and then giving it the appropriate treatment as director. Charlie Chaplin shows off the kind of comedic genius he is when he puts all of his heart into something, and his dedication to City Lights is very admirable. It is nice to see how far films have come since then, and there is a nice feeling of nostalgia which comes with City Lights.\nCharlie Chaplin films are always about being a visual splendour, and City Lights is no exception. The scenery of the film is nice and puts a lot of versatile settings into perspective, therefore allowing all of the visual gags to flourish in many different scenes. And everything is captured with great cinematography, so the visual appeal of City Lights lives up to the standard set by Charlie Chaplin. \nThe music in City Lights is just beautiful. Following the natural theme of romantic films by having a really light nature which is borderline sappy but never crosses over into it, the mood in City lights has a constant sense of wonder in the air. The piano music in City Lights is iconic of the style of vaudevillian humour that Charlie Chaplin is iconic for and it always gives a comedic edge to the story and all of the slapstick gags, so the success of City Lights is enhanced largely by the musical score.\nCity Lights is essentially great from every angle. It has the flaws of being a dated film and the fact that some of Charlie Chaplin's jokes do not successfully stretch on as long as they did in the original release of the film, but considering that it is a piece of his artistic journey into cinema, it is terrific to see what he was all about. City Lights is clearly one of Charlie Chaplin's most defining films, and at the same time it is touching and meaningful\nBut on top of it all is the fact that Charlie Chaplin gives an impressive leading performance. As always, Charlie Chaplin makes the focus of the hilarity in City Lights. Thanks to his inability to ever break character, Charlie Chaplin plays out his famous tramp persona constantly in City Lights and manages to be both a sympathetic romantic and an over the top comedian with a powerful final effect. It is difficult not to feel sympathy for him City Lights because he seems like such a nice person who is always dragging himself into awkward situations that cause him physical harm in his journey to please everyone else, and Charlie Chaplin's charm is undeniable. The man is very funny and he has a face with a lot of life in it thanks to the iconic look of his makeup and his cheeky smile, and when it comes to the physical movements of the characters he is incredibly good. Charlie Chaplin's natural skill for slapstick humour is hilarious in City Lights and is definitely the most worthwhile reason for viewing the film. He consistently delivers the laugh with his versatile series of physical gags and the fact that he is genuinely an enjoyable screen presence, and so City Lights is easily a memorable film by serving as a showcase for his talents as a physical comedian and actor, as well as for his role as director, writer and producer of the film.\nVirginia Cherrill also gives a firm supporting performance in City Lights. Capturing the likable charm of a lovely blind girl and convincingly playing her out from a physical perspective, she gives a strong performance which boasts her natural likable charisma that comes from her general presence. Her chemistry with Charlie Chaplin has a genuine sense of passion to it even though it is all built on their silent physicality, and so the two make a good duo.\n\nSo although City Lights is a rather old film and many of its gags will not have the same kind of comedic effect today that they had on audiences upon its original release in 1931, it is a classic romantic comedy which shows Charlie Chaplin's creative mind at work as an actor, director, writer and producer.",

Since I haven't seen any of his other films, I can't really give this film a proper comparison. City Lights' story is about a tramp, who stumbles upon two people that would affect his life, a blind woman who sells flowers to earn a living and a wealthy man who is incredibly wealthy but has personal issues that leads him to excessively drink, contemplate and attempt suicide. The film explores themes of love, life, kindness, compassion, friendship, and social status. The film's protagonist is a man who doesn't have a home and wonders around the city with no sense of real direction, but one thing he is sure of is that even when things are rough, life is still worth living. City Lights show the difference of values between the overly rich and the struggling poor. The two people that our protagonist meets are of within these two classes. The film depicts the rich society to be \"living\" through possessions, which is really sad to see but definitely true. The poor on the other hand lived through feeling emotions and be in the company of loved ones, but this doesn't mean they don't have any issues as life necessities are still hard to come by and something like a minor illness can put someone bed bound for a couple of days, ergo no income. Though the tramp is penniless himself, he had a sense of self-worth. He seems to be between both worlds, seeing and comparing the life of two different people and two different lifestyles, yet he doesn't show any judgement and compassionately aiding both strangers because the film depicts the Tramp as the type of person that we citizens should try and reach for.\n\nCity Lights was the first film I have seen that was directed by Charles Chaplin. Chaplin balances both the film's slapstick comedy and endearing romance quite well but though both are well balanced, both are also equally underwhelming in execution. Half of the film's comedic gags were trying a bit too hard to have the audience laugh. But when the gags do hit, they hit hard; It took me a while to stop laughing at the boxing sequence, but maybe because I have always been fascinated with the sport of boxing. The film's romance was entertaining and emotionally charged but it never seems to amount to anything significant. The film's pacing was nicely handled, moving at a brisk pace, giving both stories with the blind girl and wealthy drunk man equal times.\n\nThe film features great black and white photography and a very memorable score. I don't really want to get into much detail because I personally feel like another re-watch is necessary in order for me to properly review the film's photography and musical score.\n\nThe film's acting was top notch, with a great performance from Charles Chaplin. He was able to balance both the character's comedic and emotional tendencies. Chaplin is a wonderful physical actor and very committed in having scenes in becoming impactful. Virginia Cherrill as the blind woman and Harry Myers as the rich man were also wonderful to watch, though neither came off as effective as Chaplin did.\n\nCity Lights was a great introduction for me into the art of silent films. I look forward in trying out more of Charles Chaplin films, and after that maybe give filmmakers like Buster Keaton and Carl Theodor Dreyer a go.",

            "content": "\"Tomorrow the birds will sing.\"\n\nBefore Raging Bull or Rocky, Charles Chaplin brought us one of the most memorable boxing scenes in film history. The scene is so well choreographed and performed by Chaplin that it proves what a genius he truly was. It's been more than 80 years since the film was released and it still remains as one of the best romantic comedies ever made. City Lights has a lot of heart, several funny moments, and a perfectly executed final scene that will touch even the hardest hearts. I've seen many famous scenes from Chaplin's work, but this is the first time I sat through a full movie of his. It was a unique and joyous experience despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of pantomime and some of the gags run a bit too long. Chaplin was not only a great actor, but he also was an excellent director, writer, and composer. The film is well edited and the technical achievements are surprisingly good. In the midst of the talkie revolution Chaplin decided to remain silent despite adding some amusing sound effects and he proved that powerful stories could be told without dialogue. It's a work of pure genius and a film that all film lovers should experience on their own. City Lights has encouraged me to begin a Chaplin marathon during this week and I think it's going to be a lot of fun to get to know one of cinema's most beloved characters: the tramp.\n\nCharles Chaplin plays the Little Tramp once again in City Lights and this time he meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) with whom he falls in love. Without her knowing it, he follows her to her home and discovers she is in financial troubles, so being the selfless little tramp he is he decides to try to help her out. Despite not having any money, the tramp tries to find ways to help her out while she mistakenly believes he is a millionaire. The tramp begins looking for work and even enters a boxing ring in order to make some money to help the girl pay for an operation that will restore her sight back, but he is unsuccessful in most of his endeavors. While searching for a place to rest one night near the city's river he accidentally runs into a millionaire (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide. The tramp saves his life and the two get drunk together and become friends. The only problem is that when the millionaire is sober he forgets about his friend so their relationship is on and off depending on the amount of alcohol he has had.\n\nCity Lights has a simple premise, but the way Chaplin tells the story is very captivating and heart warming. His physical performance is among the best I've seen and his facial expressions are priceless. There is also an underlying message behind his funny and touching tale and the tramp represents the best side of humanity. The themes of selflessness, kindness, and classism still resonate in our society today. If you weren't won over by the story in general I am sure the ending will touch everyone and the hilarious boxing scene will tickle even the most grumpy hearts. City Lights is a film full of grace and you don't see movies like these made any more. During a troubled time after the Great Depression, Chaplin managed to maintain a sense of humor and bring joy and laughter to an era that was very much in need of it.",

Films at this time had just begin to use sync sound and silent films were already beginning to seem ancient by comparison, but because of the Little Tramp's popularity with filmgoers, the film was a major success. As for the film itself, it's a marvelously simple story of a poor man (the Little Tramp) falling in love with a blind woman who sells flowers on the street corner. Along his way he meets a wealthy but inebriated man who both befriends him and helps him, only to reject him when he sobers up the next day. The story builds to one of the finest endings to a movie ever put to film. It's sweet, appropriate and tugs at your heart strings. Purportedly an all-time favorite film of the likes of Orson Welles, Andrei Tarkovsky, Frederico Fellini, Stanley Kubrick and George Bernard Shaw, City Lights is also considered both one of the best silent films ever made and one of the best films ever made in general.

I watched it so many times, but this is the first time that I decided to write a review about this classic which the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Movies ranked City Lights as the 11th greatest American film of all time! This romantic comedy written by, directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin follows the misadventures of Chaplin's Tramp as he falls in love with a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) and develops a turbulent friendship with an alcoholic millionaire (Harry Myers). The millionaire wasn't originally the first choice for a subplot, Chaplin first considered a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot was based on an old idea Chaplin had for a short, where two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs, and then drop him back off at the dump. That was when he woke up the Tramp was never sure if what happened was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire is a friend of the Tramp when drunk, but does not recognize him when sober.\r\n\r\n[img]http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/14400000/City-Lights-charlie-chaplin-14440846-500-396.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nWhen Chaplin started developing the script in 1928 sound films were on the rise, but he decided to continue working with silent productions. Filming started in December 1928, and ended in September 1930. Chaplin was great in almost everything he touched and in this movie for the first time he was the composer of the music which was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston. The main theme used as a leitmotif for the blind flower girl is the song \"La Violetera\" composed by the Spanish composer Jos\u00e9 Padilla, and Chaplin lost a lawsuit to Padilla for not crediting him.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.zuguide.com/image/Charlie-Chaplin-City-Lights.1.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nFor me, this was probably the highest accomplishments of Chaplin's career and I am glad that in 1992, the Library of Congress selected City Lights for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2007, In 1949, the critic James Agee referred to the final scene in the film as the \"greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid\". Many will agree with him! At the gala premiere on 30 January 1931, at the Los Angeles Theater. Albert Einstein and his wife were the guests of honour, and the film received a standing ovation. I have to say that from all the movies made until 1952, I will agree with the Sight and Sound magazine's choice in which City Lights finished second in voting for \"The Best Films of All Time\", after Vittorio DeSica's Bicycle Thieves!  If you haven't seen it - go and do it now.\r\n\r\n[img]http://www.claudiocolombo.net/FotoDVD/lucidellacitta5.jpg[/img]",

            "content": "*Spoilers: be forewarned*\n\n          Everyone knows to expect a hilarious, classic, and memorable experience from Charlie Chaplin's films, and that's exactly what you get from City Lights.  To many, it's perceived as a timeless classic that can be enjoyed time and time again, even eighty years later.  The story is one that centers on a tramp who befriends a wealthy- but troubled- businessman, as well as a beautiful lady who also happens to be blind.  This tramp's journey focuses on his struggle to help this lady receive a treatment that could cure her blindness- basically, all hell breaks loose.  \n\n          To the beat of wide acclaim, the film definitely possesses a lot of strengths to convince everyone of its sheer quality.  First of all, music is a very crucial element to a movie, and that couldn't be anymore emphasized in City Lights.  Its music is highly effective as it exists to build up a certain funny situation.  It cleverly stays in rhythm to the characters' movements and its impressive sync with the action continues throughout the film.  The music, itself, services and largely contributes to the comedy.  Without its music, it might not even have burst audiences into joyful tears.  \n\n          As you may already know, it's a classic comedy- removed of tired, modern sexual and crude humor.  It is solely bent on non-verbal gestures and feels like a breath of fresh air to an individual who's viewing it in 2013 when the movie industry is filled with mindless and adolescent comedies.  On a more negative note, some of the comedic moments feel slightly predictable; mainly the scene at the harbor.  The film invites its viewers to laugh along as the scene progresses and the joke persists, but I, myself, didn't find that scene, in particular, as enjoyable and laughable as the rest.  You have Charlie Chaplin standing terribly close to the edge of the docks, and you fully know what's coming next, and then you have the two characters (Charlie Chaplin, the wealthy businessman) reverse roles, and still, you expect the businessman to fall into the water, and the joke runs on with these repeated actions to the point of obviousness, regarding the next step.  Some other scenes suffered from such predictability as well, but I still forgave them because the rest of the film shone through its hilarity.  \n\n         Through its comedy, the film carries with it a great use of irony for its more comedic segments, and since the film was ultimately silent, no one blatantly spelled out the joke for you on the screen.  The audience has to pay attention to the transpiring events on-screen as the jokes run for a healthy duration.  Unlike the comedies nowadays, this film wasn't bent on telling straight-forward jokes, and that'd be the end of it.  Its jokes weren't exactly jokes, per se, but hilarious events that ran on for five or so minutes.  In short, City Lights contains enough intelligence to permit the audience to figure out the irony or simple funniness of a scene by themselves.  Some might not even a sight an object that's coming into play for the rest of the running joke or a character who might reappear later for great delivery.  \n\n         That's another terrific strength of the film: its wonderful use of props, which you so rarely see nowadays.  Back in those days, as cinema was still advancing and experimenting, the props were fairly important to a production, and you can expect a great deal of objects in the background to be used for a certain comical scene.  It's all rather amusing and forces the audience to patiently heed every shot.  In that case, although City Lights consists of a significant amount of humor, some entertaining points of the film fall a little flat due to the lack of logical sense.  For instance, when the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is seated at the party and is proceeding with his noodles, how could he not taste paper when the noodle-like strings intervened with his dinner?  I'm sure anyone could distinguish the taste between the two; so, that felt a little odd.  Also, when the blind woman touches anyone who's speaking to her, why is she still facing another direction when she already knows where that person is standing?  I find this a fair complaint because some just excuse any flaws from a dated film simply because they're classics and they were made decades ago, but they're still films regardless.  This has nothing to do with it being outdated as it has more to do with the script.  \n\n          In addition to its clever use of props, the film features incredible choreography.  For example, the boxing scene where the tramp is forced to fight it out with a brawny foe in the ring- that scene, alone, is the pinnacle of choreography as you have its character quickly shifting to new positions while the other character swings away all while another character is involved in the intensity as well, and it's done to such flawlessness with lengthy camera shots.  Preceding the event, I particularly loved how menacing they made this boxer out to be.  You have this formidable individual beat the living daylights out of a boxer who just recently defeated another seemingly tough fighter.  \n\n         To that tune, there was the brilliant build-up to the comedic moments overall with the robbing scene coming to mind firstly.  The scene presents us with its character talking amongst themselves along with the props/objects in the background and a backstory to complement it.  We know that earlier in the film, this eccentric millionaire sought to off himself with a gun, but now- forty minutes later- that same gun is set up in a way and the actions of the businessman lead the police to suspect the tramp instead of the robbers that invaded the peaceful conversation.  In general, these scenes are exceptionally, wisely done, and that is what causes the comedy of the film to shine as brightly as the city's lights (excuse the intentional pun).  \n\n         However, most importantly- above all the witty humor and whatnot- is the film's impressively strong themes, regarding an over-reliance on good looks and social status in our unfair world.  Many don't consider this a theme of the story or don't notice it, but I feel as if the way it's set up seems to point to such a riveting perspective.  Well, you have a blind woman who meets the tramp, and since she's not able to witness any surroundings with her eyes, she's only led to believe that she has encountered a dreamy and handsome man who has a considerable amount of wealth attached to him.  In reality, it's indisputable that he's one of imperfection (no offense to Charlie Chaplin) and doesn't possess the money she believes he does.  Truthfully, his wealthy friend provides him with the cash to purchase aromatic flowers and the treatment itself.  In the very end, when she's finally cured and faces her admirer, the look on her face is one of surprise.  It's quite obvious that he's not the man she expected, and we are left with this somewhat ambiguous ending which leaves our protagonists face-to-face.  Did she accept him after she discovered his impoverished status and his short stature? \n\n        All in all, I found its themes and story immensely compelling and left absolutely satisfied because I did not, in the slightest, expect a film during its time to explore such fascinating and true themes and leave as open-ended as it did without that conclusive happy ending that usually infested cinema back in the days.  Albeit a few minor flaws here and there, City Lights is definitely one of the classics everyone ought to view for themselves.",

            "content": "City Lights (Charles Chaplin, 1931)\n\nThe work of Charlie Chaplin has been one of the gaping holes in my film viewing my entire life. I was always more a Buster Keaton guy, and never got round to watching the Little Tramp until very recently, and I still haven't seen muchof his work at all (though I have enjoyed all I've seen). And thus it is that I didn't get around to seeing City Lights for the first time until last weekend. And it's wonderful, of course it's wonderful, but now, almost by default, I'm involved in the debate: City Lights (as I write this, #39 in IMDb's Top 250) or Modern Times (currently at #44)? Both are fantastic, and at least if you go by the voters at IMDB, they're Chaplin's two best. Critically, looking at Rotten Tomatoes, Modern Times' 100% edges City Lights' 98% (with the one dissenter being The Nation's Alexander Bakshy), while They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, which aggregates critical top-X lists, has CL at 29 and MT at 43 on their top 1000 (numbers mined 13Mar2013). The battle rages on! It's a personal thing, I think-City Lights is the more \"serious\" of the two films, despite its slapstick sequences, a love story that happens to be funny, while Modern Times is a comedy with pretensions (successful ones, obviously) to massive spectacle and pointed satire. I find both wonderful...but I'm siding with Modern Times.\n\nWhich, again, is not to say that City Lights is not one of filmdom's finest offerings. Chaplin, playing his much-beloved Tramp character, meets a blind flower girl (White Heat beauty Virginia Cherrill). Through an amusing series of missteps, she comes to believe that the Tramp is actually very wealthy. Which would seem to be a problem-except that the Tramp subsequently meets a millionaire (The Chinatown Mystery's oft-uncredited Harry Myers), convinces him not to commit suicide in one of the funniest slapstick routines this side of The General, and becomes his pal, much to the dismay of the millionaire's butler (Chaplin regular Al Ernest Garcia). All goes well until the Tramp discovers an article in the newspaper about a Swiss scientist who has developed an operation that can restore sight to the blind; his good heart says there's no decision to be made here and he should help her in any way possible, but on the other hand, will she still love him if she can see who he really is?\n\nI don't know what happened in American film. Somehow the term \"rom-com\" has become a pejorative, but if we look back at many of America's most beloved films-City Lights, Bringing Up Baby, Singin' in the Rain, Some Like It Hot, Neighbors, Sabrina, hell, even the acid-etched The Apartment or the ultra-bitchy All About Eve-you've  got one helluva lot of rom-coms. And they're all amazing. Why isn't anyone writing this stuff anymore instead of [fill in the Gerard-Butler-Is-Woefully-Miscast rom-com of the year]? But I don't mean to get sidetracked wondering about the death of the romantic comedy in America instead of focusing on this particular rom-com, for which one can use the term \"an exemplar of the breed\" (if not the exemplar of the breed; I can think of many almost as good, most mentioned earlier in this paragraph, but I can't think of one better). Chaplin does a lot of funny things, people fall in love, there's an obstacle to be overcome and an ethical dilemma for the main character... it's all the right ingredients, turned into a perfectly tasty stew by Chaplin (who also wrote) and served up with just the right amount of style and a refreshing dose of straightforwardness. As far as rom-coms go, they don't come better than this. And I'll say again that I think which one any given person prefers is a matter of personal taste; Modern Times has that satirical bite and big-picture mentality, whereas City Lights is a small, simple film. Both are amazing. You gotta see 'em. ****  1/2",

            "content": "One of my biggest movie-related regrets that I hadn't seen a single Charlie Chaplin film.  The director and actor has received massive acclaim, and is still considered today to be one of the world's greatest directors.  And yet, I had not seen any of his films.  In fact, I had seen relatively few silent films at all.  However, if Chaplin's other work is even nearly as good as City Lights, I will not hesitate to see his many other films.\n\nOften considered one of Chaplin's best films, City Lights is the story of a young tramp (portrayed by Charlie Chaplin), who befriends a drunk millionaire.  The tramp uses resources provided by the millionaire to give gifts to a young, blind girl, whom the tramp has fallen in love with.  Things are a bit complicated, though, as when the millionaire is sober, he does not remember ever befriending the tramp.\n\nDue to my limited exposure to films of this era, this review may seem a bit more pointed towards the art of silent film in general, as opposed to this specific film.  \n\nAt times, City Lights plays like a big cartoon.  Slap stick and quirky situations saturate this film, insuring that there is never a dull moment.  This is not sophisticated comedy, and it does not take a sophisticated mind to enjoy.  In fact, this is likely one of the reasons for City Light's success; it's accessibility.\n\nChaplin arranges a large number of very elaborate humorous sketches.  A masterpiece in comic timing, City Lights is an absolute delight to watch.  There are dozens of memorable scenes.  If you're not smiling at any given point during the film, you're probably laughing.\n\nActually, I take back what I just said.  For even though City Lights is a comedy, it's also a romance.  Very touching, and even tear-jerking at times, City Lights proves that it's just as effective as pulling heart strings as it is at tickling funny bones.\n\nThe romance succeeds for a number of reasons.  For one, we feel invested in the characters and their story.  The film is only 82 minutes, which doesn't leave much time for the characters to be developed, and because City Lights is a silent film, only important lines are shown as subtitles.  Everything else is silent.  And yet, the characters are defined and layered, some more subtly than others.\n\nThe romance also works due to the excellent acting.  Charlie Chaplin quite literally makes this movie.  His both hilarious and touching performance as the tramp is sincere and humorous.  Virginia Cherrill portraying the blind girl is another great performance, and Harry Myers effectively portrays the eccentric millionaire.\n\nI also believe the romance actually benefits from not having dialogue.  I say this dialogue is the number one thing that kills a good romance in a film.  You could have the best actors and actresses in the world, but with bad dialogue, comes bad romance.  By eliminating dialogue, City Lights also eliminates this common issue in modern film that's not just limited to romantic flicks.\n\nThe score (also composed by Charlie Chaplin, as well as Arthur Johnston) is delightful.  Boasting a large number of catchy and clever tunes, the score is both diverse and entertaining.  Music has a much more important role in silent films than in today's \"talkies,\" but Chaplin and Johnston have no problem here.\n\nNot all the sketches work as well as others, and the heavy slapstick may not meet everyone's tastes, but City Lights is a brilliant film that succeeds on both an emotional level, and a comedic one.  Funnier and touching than most of today's films, City Lights isn't perfection, nor is it without flaw, but the sincerity and simplicity in which the story is presented is simply beautiful.  I look forward to watching more of Chaplin's films in the near future.",

The script is also brilliant in giving him enough scenes to work with.\n\nHe has one awesome over-the-top drunk scene, which might be instantly one of my favourite drunk scenes ever. Add one incredibly ludicrous box fight and you can count me in. There are also a lot of other silly slapstick scenes (although not the quality of Keaton's stunts) and there's a romantic subplot that isn't as generic as usual.\n\nEspecially the end is greatly moving. And moving me is not an easy task for any film, and especially for a silent and/or comedy this means something.\nThe millionaire character with alcohol-related amnesia was also quite funny, I liked him even more than the Tramp, and I can relate with him to some degree.\n\nI can't say I fell in love with City Lights as much as the Tramp with the flower girl but I must admit, it's the best Chaplin film I've seen so far, and I'll certainly expand on my silent slapstick viewings.",

Charlie's films will always stand out in the history of film making as he brought something new to the silver screen. City Lights is an exceptional silent film that showed the simplicity of romance and the length of ideology any one will go to keep it, from living a lie, to going to jail all in the name of love.\n\nThe final scene in the movie has been sighted by many to be one of the greatest scenes in cinema history. I to accept that claim, the tramp's melancholy look as all the walls of lies fall apart will touch you in ways that will make you smile; the acting that followed it was masterfully done.\n\nNext to that scene my second favorite scene is the boxing fight, if you have not seen this movie before get ready for the laugh of your life, the screenplay is masterful, the acting is wonderful and the sound effects just enough. Such scenes make you wonder what Charlie movies would have been if he had all the gadgets and money that studios are pumping into movies this days.\n\nLike other Chaplin movies, this is a slapstick comedy done in 1931. He wrote produced and directed the movie. By the time of its release talkies were already in vogue (sound) but Chaplin took a shot in the dark making this movie a silent movie, he did fear though that the reception will not be good, but this movie did well in the box office and also was well received.\n\nThe story plot as others is about the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) this time tramp meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl who happens to be blind. \n\nWhile the tramp was taking his leisure stroll he runs into a wealthy man, whom he befriended but the relationship was on and off, as the man will at times recognize Charlie and later forget that they know each other. The tramp on the other hand used his connection with the wealthy man to help his love as she was going through financial trouble.\n\nHolding the eleventh place in the AFI greatest film of all time, City Lights is one classic romantic comedy that will leave Charlie's name in the lips of many film goers for a long time. No matter what your take is concerning silent movies, make sure this one does not pass you by.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

However, the next sequence he might be sharing a very nice moment with the girl who only knows him by his voice and kind deeds. Fittingly, in the final moments of the film, the flower girl who can now see is reunited with the humble tramp who showed her so much kindness. Overall this was a very good film and it seemed to have a wonderful balance of humor and romance. It proves that sound is not always needed if you are a good storyteller.",

In an era where Slapstick comedy has worn out, \"City Lights\" revives it despite being one of the first of the genre. In an era where drama is delivered with heart-tugging dialogue that is bolstered with convincing emotional expressions, \"City Lights\" delivers simply through great acting capability.

The scene is so well choreographed and performed by Chaplin that it proves what a genius he truly was. It's been more than 80 years since the film was released and it still remains as one of the best romantic comedies ever made. City Lights has a lot of heart, several funny moments, and a perfectly executed final scene that will touch even the hardest hearts. I've seen many famous scenes from Chaplin's work, but this is the first time I sat through a full movie of his. It was a unique and joyous experience despite the fact that I'm not the biggest fan of pantomime and some of the gags run a bit too long. Chaplin was not only a great actor, but he also was an excellent director, writer, and composer. The film is well edited and the technical achievements are surprisingly good. In the midst of the talkie revolution Chaplin decided to remain silent despite adding some amusing sound effects and he proved that powerful stories could be told without dialogue. It's a work of pure genius and a film that all film lovers should experience on their own. City Lights has encouraged me to begin a Chaplin marathon during this week and I think it's going to be a lot of fun to get to know one of cinema's most beloved characters: the tramp.\n\nCharles Chaplin plays the Little Tramp once again in City Lights and this time he meets a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) with whom he falls in love. Without her knowing it, he follows her to her home and discovers she is in financial troubles, so being the selfless little tramp he is he decides to try to help her out. Despite not having any money, the tramp tries to find ways to help her out while she mistakenly believes he is a millionaire. The tramp begins looking for work and even enters a boxing ring in order to make some money to help the girl pay for an operation that will restore her sight back, but he is unsuccessful in most of his endeavors. While searching for a place to rest one night near the city's river he accidentally runs into a millionaire (Harry Myers) who is about to commit suicide. The tramp saves his life and the two get drunk together and become friends. The only problem is that when the millionaire is sober he forgets about his friend so their relationship is on and off depending on the amount of alcohol he has had.\n\nCity Lights has a simple premise, but the way Chaplin tells the story is very captivating and heart warming. His physical performance is among the best I've seen and his facial expressions are priceless. There is also an underlying message behind his funny and touching tale and the tramp represents the best side of humanity. The themes of selflessness, kindness, and classism still resonate in our society today. If you weren't won over by the story in general I am sure the ending will touch everyone and the hilarious boxing scene will tickle even the most grumpy hearts. City Lights is a film full of grace and you don't see movies like these made any more. During a troubled time after the Great Depression, Chaplin managed to maintain a sense of humor and bring joy and laughter to an era that was very much in need of it.",

Great supporting performances from The Eccentric Millionaire (Harry Myers) and The Blind Flower Girl (Virginia Cherrill), who are a key factor to this film. Of course, Chaplin steals the show, in his second last outing as \"The Tramp\", a loveable character he invented in 1914. As in every Chaplin movie, there's a funny eating scene - this time he eats party streamer tied into his spaghetti - really funny to watch that! I would recommend his film to anybody.",

Where else except someplace dear could a filmmaker develop a picture so touching and filled with such heart. Biographical parallels suggest that Chaplin derived the story from his past, whereas the filmmaker's improvisational approach to directing suggests his stories never came effortlessly. As opposed to unswerving inspiration, the process from conception to completion often spanned several years. He labored over scenarios, this one in particular. And through his involved method, he sacrificed his personal life to feed his artistic drives. Behind those drives, however, dwelled an artist whose early years shaped his stories, consciously or not...\r\n\r\nRead the full article here:\r\nhttp://www.deepfocusreview.com/reviews/citylights.asp",

            "content": "Like the music of the Beatles, how is it that Chaplin's work still feels so fresh? Does reverence color our perception or is the product just simply of superior quality? I would argue the latter as I believe that even without prior knowledge of the artists involved, anyone can understand the majesty of \"Eleanor Rigby\" or be significantly moved by Charlie Chaplin's 1931 film \"City Lights.\"\nFirst off, the film is uproariously funny. Even by modern day standards in which slapstick comedies aren't vogue, Chaplin manages to sell the most inane gags. This is aided obviously by the unrivaled power of his facial expressions. Sure they are comical and over the top, but they are expertly nuanced and give his \"tramp\" character much depth.\nCity Lights also encompasses not only timeless messages of love and fraternity, but also one of class distinction that would have been very palpable to American crowds mired in the consequences of the Great Depression. In fact, the film starts off with one of the more moving images I have seen in American cinema in which during an unveiling of a statue celebrating America's peace and prosperity, a crowd is stunned to find a homeless man, our tramp, sleeping on the monument. Chaplin not only pulled off a grand introduction for his protagonist, but also managed to sum up about one hundred years of American history in one scene. Simply stunning.\nWith the advent of talking pictures during this time, City Lights also utilizes sound in a creative way. From the indiscriminate mumbling of politicians to the tramp's involuntary whistling, Chaplin managed to satisfy those accustomed to traditional silent pictures and those searching for something a little more exciting in their entertainment.\nFilms of this caliber are rare and deserve every ounce of praise that they receive. Because whether you first witnessed this film during it's opening weekend or whether you stumbled upon it while scouring YouTube, I can almost guarantee that it put a smile on your face.",

Charlie Chaplin is one of the most talented men I can think of, he writes, stars, and directs this movie and it all adds up into a masterpiece.  This was my first silent film to watch and soon after this I saw much more of Chaplin's work, and although its all great I still consider this to be his best work.  Silent films are something some people can't stand, but for me its a breath of fresh air and makes this film unique.  The plot of the film is romantic and funny, but its telling the selfless story of the Tramp and his trying to help a blind flower girl after falling in love with her.  The plot is a work of genius because we are able to understand the story without words, but with visual, and Chaplin is able to make that visual hilarious from start to finish.  I honestly did not think I would laugh at this film, but boy was I wrong, there is some seriously funny stuff in that movie and has made me a lifelong Chaplin fan.  Its also a very influential story, the Tramp saves a man from killing himself and since this was based in the Depression-era there were a lot of people like this, so Chaplin was basically telling everyone to stand up and face life.  Just a perfect script, I loved it.  The cast is all wonderful but it's Charlie Chaplin who steals the show (obviously).  He is like a cartoon character when he plays the Tramp, just every time he is on the screen you can't help but smile.  He has perfect comedic timing and some great acting as well, and it has turned him into my favorite silent film actor and one of Americas greatest treasures.  City Lights is not a film, its a work of art that should be treasured for it great comedy, incredible acting, great directing, and a ending that will melt the heart of everyone.",

The fragrance of the movie is the 'Tramp' played by Charlie Chaplin, one of the most sensuous, funny , timeless and immortal characters ever portrayed by the Mozart of Cinema's The Great Chaplin. The word outstanding and excellent might be an understatement for this charismatic and immortal genius who directed,scripted and acted in this movie. This silent movie speaks to the world through its puissant storytelling, the emotions flowing between the 'Tramp' and his love the 'Blind Girl' are so rejuvenating and soul stirring. Even after 81 years of its release City lights might be the only movie that can deeply burn your heart to such an extent that you will nearly cry out of happiness when the movie ends. The comedy might look slap stick but to see Chaplin enact it is so beautiful and funny. The name of the movie is about a night in which the tramp amidst the cities night lights make's money for this beautiful blind girl's eye operation. He endures in Herculean and dangerous tasks on that day all for saving his true love from being in the streets forever. The story is quite simple but the narration is elegant and masterful. The casting is great and the ironic closing scene is one of the most heartfelt and touching sequences ever. If a soul is not touched by that sequence then perhaps nothing can ever touch him. The cinematography is so picturesque and focuses on the characters so well. Being a silent film, the narration and the actions of the characters are of prime importance. And true to that Chaplin and the rest of the cast does great. City lights is a flaming and soul stirring motion picture about true love and unlike many Chaplin's pictures in which only slap stick comedy is shown this movie masterfully captures the emotional buzz between the two characters in a very musical and rhythmic way.\r\n\r\nMy rating :A+",

I was thoroughly surprised at how enticing everything was. Although, it may not be as funny as you might expect(there are several great hilarious moments, but it's not as many as you'd expect.) But considering the film isn't too focused on the gags, it's not really an issue.

I screened it with two pre-teens and they were rapt, so the fact that it's silent, black and white and has weird old costumes and cars was not a deterrent for their enjoying this masterpiece.  It's a film that never leaves the consciousness once it's been seen.\n\nThe story is an elemental fairy tale, a little tramp falls in love with a blind flower girl and becomes her guardian angel, and give up what little he has to save her and get her an operation.  Somehow, when handled by Charlie, we buy in to this over the top melodrama, because of total commitment and honesty and superb execution, that holds back just enough to not wallow in bathos.\n\nWatch for the balletic comedic set pieces, every deft move rehearsed by Chaplin and his supporting cast to perfection, yet all looking spontaneous. Watch for this film dealing honestly with human cruelty, (poverty, violence, class wars) but showing the goodness and kindness we all have latent in ourselves.   \n\nMost of all, watch for the most emotionally wrenching last scene ever shot, done simply with close ups of  Chaplin and his costar Virgina Cherril as the Blind Girl.  As one of the reviewer has already stated below, you'd have to be dead inside to not be moved.  2011's The Artist was a terrific acheivement at recreating silent film, but if you want to experience what silent film can truly acheive, take out City Lights.   Interestingly, CIty Lights, like the story of The Artist, was made during the talkie era of 1931 and no one missed sound at all.",

The second story line was also a treat. The Tramp saves the millionaire and becomes his friend. The funny part is that the millionaire only recognizes him when he is drunk and not when he's sober. That's comedy writing at its best. Wait, does this have a script considering that it's silent.? I don't know how movie making worked back then so don't ask me. Doesn't matter that I'm a guy I still loved the romantic plot. It was very sweet that The Tramp went threw all the trouble to get the blind girl money for her eyes. You don't find guys like that anymore. The last scene has to be the best in cinematic history. The blind girl finally gets to see the tramp after having her eyes fixed. But would she still love him now knowing that he is not a millionaire but a tramp? \"Yes I see now\". What does that mean? It could mean she can see with her eyes or it could mean that she could see that he is poor. Only you can decide.",

            "content": "> > > So far, year 2011 has been friendly for making me really generous in accepting great, and not so great, works of cinema. It's already the second-half of the year, yet I have been glorious for watching some of the great films ever. I'm a fool for not recording seen-films for the first two months of the year. By that, I've totally forgotten what I watched. But since the succeeding month which was March, I make sure to record films I've seen monthly. And of all the best cinema-related things I encountered so far this year, nothing may top an actor with a vast repertoire. A legendary figure who was gone many years ago, but will still lingers within the cinematic world forever. A remarkable man who was once Charlie Chaplin.\r\n\r\n- \"City Lights\" is a wonderful, heartfelt, funny, romantic, memorable, and other suited-adjectives it may be movie made for heavenly viewing. The undisputed greatest character in motion picture history known as \"The Tramp\" is pure excellent in every way. Here, he's still the usual cane-holding, penguin-like walking, smirking dweller who finds surroundings as stage for whimsical showings. Equally divided into zany scenarios, The Tramp finds himself in situations such as saving a suicidal friendly-whenever-drunk millionaire; Doing catastrophic antics in a restaurant; Sleeping on a ready-to-be-publicly-revealed statues; Being falsely accused of theft; Joining a winner-takes-all boxing bout; And ultimately falling in love with a beautiful blind flower vendor.\r\n\r\n- As much as I love his other three masterpieces namely, \"The Kid\", \"The Gold Rush\", and \"Modern Times\", \"City Lights\" may be the most endearing. He showcased his immortal character as an everyman who found his life's direction when he saw the \"Flower Girl\". He made it very clear that his main goal is not for himself, but to help the lady to be able to see again. As for the comedy aspects, it's all here; And it may has the fullest of his trademarks among his features. And as for technical matters, the musical score is brilliant and uplifting throughout. This film just ousted \"Roman Holiday\" as the best romantic film I've ever seen. As I conclude, \"City Lights\" is a classic in every sense, and is the kind of film you have to see to officially declare yourself a true apostle of the cinema.\r\n\r\n> BestMoment:\r\n- The ending when The Tramp smiles as Flower Girl says she can see now.\r\n\r\n> BestQuote:\r\n- The Tramp: \"Can you see now?\" \r\n   Blind Girl: \"Yes, I can see now.\"\r\n(Since it's a silent film, I chose a dialogue that popped to the screen.)",

He directed those stories that he wrote with such perfection. And he played an immortal charcter that is no doubt about it one of the best ever created. \r\n\r\n\"City Lights\" is not only a great film, it's a movie that knows what it wants to do and the impact it wanted to made.  And much like other movies, \"City Lights\" doesn't age. It's a romantic comedy that balences both genres and knows what to do with both, all this while staying relatable. The story is about The Tramp ( played by Chaplin) who falls in love to a blind girl at the same time he befriends a rich drunk guy who's life is saves. Because the girl is poor, The Tramp does his best to help her and clear all her problems away.\r\n\r\nI wouldbe lying if I saud this is my favorite Chaplin movie  ( of the 3 I saw...) but this movie has all the right t be considered one of the best romantic comedies of all time. The moments that are funny are freaking hilarious and the moments who are deeply emotional... my god, they are deeply emotional. This is probably one of the best movies that makes us forget that we are watching a movie. And thefact is, \"City Lights\" doesn't need sound to show this. The emotions appear through thecharacters actions and what drives them to do all those things for each other. The slapstick is amazingly hilarious and Chaplin again prooves why he did this so damn well. The ending of \"City Lights\" is simply perfect and if you don't be at least touched by it, well my friend, you probably don't have emotions.\r\n\r\nI can not give this a perfect score because one or two moments were a bit far from what the movie was but that's it. The story is magnificent and \"City Lights\" is a masterpiece.",

The iconic and everlasting character of The Tramp, one of the most lovable, truly human and sympathetic characters perhaps of all time. Sometimes there is some hate towards tramps, like they are labeled lazy and troublesome. It is very hard to hate The Tramp, because he gives so much when he has so little. He spends his time and money giving to people - whether it be saying a millionaires life or buying a flower from a blind girl. Undoubtedly, we all have a little bit of The Tramp in us.\r\n\r\nThe plot is as follows: the Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind girl who sells flowers on the street. She is poor and by a mere coincidence, believes that The Tramp is rich. He also saves a drunken millionaire from suicide, and despite his gratefulness, doesn't remember the poor tramp unless he is drunk.\r\n\r\nCity Lights is no doubt a magnificent feat in motion picture history. It's poignant view of the world and society leaves you laughing and crying at the same time. Some believe this should really be called a drama instead of a comedy. I believe it is a strong mixture of both, and a great balance of the two. Both comedic and touching, City Lights should not be missed by anyone.",

Starring once more the classic character the tramp this Chaplin film was equally as charming as it was funny. As a comedy it certainly compares to other comedies out there -and certainly outlives many of the newest ones around-. City Lights is easily one of the greatest silent films and all because of Chaplin's marvellous writing, acting and of course, directing. It's got plenty of good moments and the occasional use of comic sounds and it's overall a beautiful film. It's great that Charlie Chaplin stuck with silent films just a while longer, and five years after this film would go on to having his last, being Modern Times. It's truly a comical masterpiece and is much more than just a comedy; it's a wonderful drama and romance story.\r\n\r\nFull review:\r\nhttp://movierelatedblogs.blogspot.com/2011/06/silent-film-marathon-18-city-lights.html",

The premise here is about a down and out tramp who falls in love with a blind flower girl, and is eager to show his affection, despite his inabilities as a poor man.  Fortunately, he winds up befriending a millionaire, and is able to provide for her, but ultimately at his own dismay.  The ending scene is heralded as a pinnacle moment of cinema, when the blind girl is finally able to see who her loving benefactor was all along.

            "content": "In most cases, actions speak louder than words. So it is true in the case of Charlie Chaplin's City Lights. His previous film, The Circus (1928), was his last film before the movie industry began to embrace the rise of sound pictures. Thanks to Chaplin's co-ownership of the United Artists production company, he could compose this film with as much freedom as he wished; thus, he went through with his plans to make this a silent film.\r\n\r\nA homeless Tramp finds himself enamored by a Flower Girl, who also happens to be blind. At around the same time, he befriends a drunken Millionaire. He helps the Tramp pretend to be a rich man, in order to impress the Flower Girl, who cannot see his dirty, tattered appearance. However, the Millionaire only remembers the Tramp when he is inebriated; thus, many problems, mostly humorous, eventually arise from this. Now, given the plot summary and nothing else, would it have been obvious that this was a black & white silent Chaplin film from the early 1930's? Probably not.\r\n\r\nNow, it would not be completely correct to state that this film is a \"true\" silent film. Though the dialogue is still presented in the form of title cards, this was his first film that included a synchronized musical score. This is most prominently expressed in the \"La Violetera\" number, a sorrowful, beautiful tune that would play upon the Tramp's meetings with the Flower Girl. Also, certain sound effects are used (horns, bells, gunshots, etc.) are used, most frequently as a way to present the humor of the film in a more \"three-dimensional\" demeanor.\r\n\r\nThe humor of the film, by the way, is another aspect which makes the film so great. Charlie Chaplin is, arguably, the greatest slapstick comedian in all of cinema, and City Lights presents this point this so well. One scene in particular involves the Tramp entered into a boxing match in order to raise money for the Flower Girl. Not surprisingly, things don't go completely as planned, and the results are hilarious. This is just one example of the numerous sequences where the Tramp narrowly escapes sticky situations, usually brought about by the Millionaire. The Tramp, though good-intentioned, seems to have his plans foiled by the Millionaire's short-term memory; this cleverly keeps us on our toes.\r\n\r\nAs far as his movies are concerned, Chaplin is famous for two prominent qualities: his prevailing sense of humor (which I have just described) and the sweet emotional qualities presented in the narrative. This is Chaplin's method of truly connecting with the audience, and it could not have been presented any more perfectly than it is in City Lights. The Tramp would do anything to win the love of the Flower Girl, though he feels as if his personal condition could negatively affect her feelings for him; thus, he offers to pay for her rent and an eye operation, then goes through hell and back to come up with the money for his promises. He risks the possibility of the Flower Girl falling out of love with the Tramp for his physicality - yet he loves her far too much to care otherwise. This, my friends, is what I call a true gentlemen.\r\n\r\nI don't want to give anything else away, but I must say that this is one of the most sweetest, charming films that have ever seen, from any era of cinema. The parallels between the Tramp's romantic relationship with the Flower Girl, and the turbulent encounters with the Millionaire, make for a truly entertaining, classic film that is never boring. Chaplin's knack at this sort of filmmaking completely proves that dialogue is not necessary in the creation of a beautiful, impressive masterpiece.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can see now.\"",

He knows how popular and loved the Tramp is, so he gets an introduction that he deserves. Lets also point out the fact that he could have made this a talkie, but instead makes it a silent film even though it was going out of style. City Lights is hilarious and heartfelt all the way through. The Tramp meets a blind flower girl that he falls in love with immediately. But like many problems the Tramp faces, he doesn't feel like he is good enough for her. One night he saves a millionaire from drowning himself and they become best pals. The Tramp decides that he can take care of the blind girl now, so he starts going around her more and decides he wants to help her with her rent problems and give her money to help her see. The only problem is that the millionaire only remembers the Tramp when he is drunk. When he is sober he kicks the Tramp out of his house, takes back his car, etc. Chaplin does his magic of making us care so much about the Tramp character. We want him to succeed in making money so he thinks he is good enough for the woman he is in love with. The boxing scene was so funny, mainly because we care about the Tramp and don't want to see him get hurt. If I was bored I'm sure I would have been on the other guy's side. It's really well choreographed, and I couldn't stop laughing when he got the rope of the bell stuck around his neck.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nCity Lights has the happiest ending of any Charlie Chaplin film I have seen so far. The millionaire remembers the Tramp for a little while and decides to give the girl $1,000 to help with the rent. But there are a couple of thieves in the house who knock him out, take his wallet, then run away. The Tramp runs and calls the cops, but when they come they think the Tramp is the one who robbed the millionaire. Of course, when the millionaire wakes up he forgets who the Tramp is. He escapes and gives the blind girl the $1,000, but goes back in town and gets caught the next day. He goes to prison for half of a year and when he comes out he is pitiful. The kids are picking on him and his posture and facial expressions show that he is a defeated man. He wants to see the blind girl again, but even if he did he doesn't think he's good enough for her anymore. Well, when he stops in front of the shop she gives him a flower and a coin. When she touches him she realizes that he is the man that gave her the money, who she had fallen in love with, and he wasn't like the tall, rich, and handsome man that walked in earlier. She doesn't care, she loves him. This is the famous shot of Charlie with the flower in his hand and his finger in his mouth with a big smile. She can see now and she still loves him. Beautiful.",

            "content": "One of Charlie Chaplin's most impressive motion pictures. To think this was a film made during talking pictures, yet Chaplin had the capacity and the whim to still make entertaining and joyful movies like this one. City Lights' is a delight to watch, it has all the quirks you would expect to see in a regular Chaplin film, and it does it all whole-heartily. For example, other Chaplin movies before City Lights were all about the comedy, about making the audience laugh at the \"fop\" who was out of date in style and fashion. But this movie takes it to the extreme. Chaplin's character(once again, the Tramp) is seen walking down the street(here the 1930s are captured beautifully), with his signature hat and cane. When he stumbles upon a blind woman, she mistakes him for a rich man with loads of money. The Tramp encounters that rich character, but instead of simply taking the money(at least at first) to pay for her eye surgery, the poor guy actually has the guts to win it in a boxing fight. Now, to me that was heart. That was what started all those million-to-one shot movies like \"Rocky\" where the protagonist does something he believes in for the woman they love. Although it may sound like a stretch, I think this was the first film to address such cliche as a mistaken identity, a story derive that would be seen in another comedy/drama film several years later, \"The Majestic.\" The Tramp's love for the blond flower girl is imminently seen through his honesty to support her, and after returning to her by the time she regains her eyesight, he picks up where his life may have been left in shambles.  The story was original and moving. And this is not to say this film is all drama, like I said, it still has those Chaplin gags. Tipping his hat in a charming way, slipping over a hole in the street, and fighting men bigger then he is. There is a particularly new sketch of Chaplin in this one though. Right before he befriends the rich man, he saves his life by preventing his suicide by plunging into the water. The sequence his funny but has a deep message. And in a way, I think that when Chaplin is struggling to save that rich man's life, he was struggling to save the Hollywood industry from going down the drain. This movie came off to me as one of his more serious films--sort of like Shakespeare. By satirizing society(like showing how rich people get wasted on their own wealth), he informs the people of their flaws and what is right and what is wrong. And just HOW is it presented? Through a silent made film during the Hollywood boom of talking pictures. Charlie Chaplin is a genius in acting, and directing. \"City Lights\"  one of his best, if not THE best.",

            "content": "By the year 1931 the production of silent films had stopped with the rise of the \"talkies\". Hollywood was overwhelmed with this productions, but Charlie Chaplin still liked the silent era. Not minding if he could talk or not, Chaplin made one more silent film that would be the best of his career. \r\n\r\nCharlie Chaplin's colorful character The Tramp is back in one last silent adventure. When he meets and falls in love with a blind woman, and befriends an alcoholic millionaire who only remembers him when he is drunk, his advntures and funny situations start to rise in a dangerous rate. And upon learning that the woman needs money for the rent, wanting to help her he gets in more troubles than he already was.\r\n\r\nToday I started watching my dad's Chaplin collection. Yes, the day before yesterday I re-watchd The Gold Rush, but today I decided I would start watching them. I've heard from lots of people that this is Chaplin's finest film so I decide to start with this one... and were they right! This film is the greatest Chaplin film I've seen, and not only that but also the greatest silent film I've seen, and it was released on the talking era, just so you know. \r\nChaplin one more time is magnificent as The Tramp, and it is possibly his best performance as him. As I said in my review of The Gold Rush, The Tramp's heart and foolishness are what make him one of the greatest characters. It is his warmth, his humor that makes us love him once again. The Tramp shows his big heart when he tries to help that poor woman. He put himself into many kinds of funny and often ridiculous jobs just to help her. His kind heart is something we don't see anymore.\r\nThis is definitely Chaplin's funniest film. In my Gold Rush review I said that was possibly the greatest comedy, I was wrong. This is the greatest comedy! Well, hard to say, Dr Strangelove is another great competitor, but this is definitely the comedy with the biggest heart. \r\nAnd this film has a very good deal of memorable scenes. We have for example when he first meets the millionaire, who is about to commit suicide but he convinces him otherwise. That scene isn't only proof of his big heart, but it is also quiet clever, for mixing humoristic situations with a heroic action and a tragic decision. And we also have of course when the millionaire takes The Tramp to a restaurant. The dance sequences are very funny, like when the woman calls for her husband to dance but the little foolish tramp thinks he is calling for him. And the party, when the butler serves him a plate of some weird desert, and while he turns around and then turns back the desert is gone but the bald head of some guy is there terribly resembling to the desert. But my favorite has of course to be the boxing match. That has to be the greatest and funniest boxing scene in cinema. And he is the greatest boxer in movie history; no Rocky Balboa, no Jake LaMotta, The Tramp! Ok, maybe I am exagerating, lol, but that scene is the funniest in the movie. And there is of course the ending. That sweet beautiful ending which has been praised by almost everybody. I won't go into details, but the ones who have seen it know what I am talking about.\r\nThis is listed at the AFI's 100 list at 11, and at the top of their romantic comedy top 10, and I can see why now. It is a wonderful film, it sure is. It is beautfiful, and shows clearly why Chaplin is a legend. \r\nThis is a must see, I highly recommend it, especially for fans of Chaplin. I give it a perfect score.",

It's good to see that his films still hold up and are truly timeless.\r\n\r\n\"City Lights\" tells a story of Chaplin's most famous character: The Tramp. The Tramp comes across a blind woman who sells flowers, and he grows very fond of her. After saving a drunk millionaire from committing suicide, The Tramp becomes his friend and they go out for a night of fun. The next morning the millionaire gives him some money to buy some flowers from the woman. The Tramp and the Blind Woman hit it off very well and begin a very cute, romantic relationships which is one of my favorite in cinema history. When the Tramp sees an ad in the newspaper about a Vienna doctor who can cure blindness, he sets out to work as hard as he can in order to earn the money she needs for the operation.\r\n\r\n\"City Lights\" is a very funny, but also dramatic movie. It really shows Charlie Chaplin as one of the greatest stars of all time. Chaplin writes, directs, and stars in this movie and his expertise in the craft really shows. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it's unforgettable.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys silent films!",

A second storyline begins when the tramp rescues a genuine millionaire (Harry Myers) from committing suicide. When drunk, the millionaire expansively treats the tramp as a friend and equal; when sober, he doesn't even recognize him. The two plots come together when the tramp attempts to raise enough money for the blind girl to have an eye operation. Highlights include an extended boxing sequence pitting scrawny Chaplin against muscle-bound Hank Mann, and the poignant final scene in which the now-sighted flower girl sees her impoverished benefactor for the first time. Chaplin's decision to release the silent City Lights three years into the talkie era was partially vindicated when more than one critic singled out this comedy in pantomime as the best picture of 1931.~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide",

The combination of comedy and drama had not really been down that well till this movie came along and proved it can be done. Even to this day comedies don't get made as well as this. Poignancy and slapstick combine. In this Charlie Chaplin makes his definitive portrayal of the little tramp. The way they open this movie to introduce the tramp. Sleeping on a park statue while all the pompous arrogent political bimbo's (and I mean that in the dated meaning of idiot) talk about some meaningless tribute to some guy who did something once and instead of just giving us some dry speech they have them all talk jibberish and nonsense. From this point it only gets better as it goes along. Along the tramps many travels and shenanigans he meets a blind flower girl in the street. He instantly falls in love with her and wants to help her win her eyesight back. At around the same time he stops a millionair drunkard from killing himself. And proceeds to befriends him. Unitll he sobers up and has no clue who he is. What follows is great slapstick comedy involving the tramps many attempts to win the money for her. Untill he meets the suicidal drunkard again and gets the money from him. After successfully helping the flower girl receive her eyesight back he is arrested for stealing the money as the millionair doesn't recall giving him the money. What follows is the greatest ending of all time. And it is so subtle in how it accomplishes it. Today we would have Robin Williams or Jim Carrey hamming it up or maybe Eddie Murphey cracking wise. But here Chaplin handles the pathos and sentimentality of the ending with such panache that any of his future transgressions (\"Monsiuer Verdoux\", \"A King in New York and to a lesser extent \"Limelight\". 1947, 1957 and 1952 respectively). Charlie Chaplin had a way with film making that other comedic talents of the day (Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd) weren't able to reach. That he was able to make a fortune off a silent movie in 1932 was a wonder. Silent movies were dead since 1928 when all the movie studios switched to sound after the raging success of the first talkie \"The Jazz Singer\". Which was only partially sound. I wish comedy film makers now where able to make comedies this good wheras they are more interest in making comedies situated around sex and bodily functions. Though that is funny it doesn't take much thought to make something funny out of these things. Whereas coming up with humor that is universal such as Chaplin is what makes a great movie. Also the fact that Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, starred, produced, conducted the music, and distributed  all his movies makes him the ultimate auteur. Todd Phillips (\"The Hangover\") doesn't have anything on Charlie Chaplin. I have probably watched this movie over a hundred times now. And just keeps getting better.",

In James Berardinelli's review of City Lights, he mentions how it was screening outside with a gigantic audience. At the end of the film, Charlie stood from a high balcony, and waved to the crowd.

Chaplin lays out a plot that is both beautifully simple and smooth for the audience. The tramp (Chaplin) falls in love with a sweet, blind flower-girl (Virginia Cherrill) and attempts to help her regain her sight by providing money for the newly found cure to blindness. The problem is, the flower-girl already believes that Chaplin is a rich gentleman, and he has no money to speak of.\r\n\r\n            This leads to the hilarious side story of the tramp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s erratic friendship with a drunken millionaire (Harry Myers). Though the millionaire only recognizes the tramp when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drunk, the two \u00e2\u0080\u009cfriends\u00e2\u0080\u009d have many funny adventures, and Chaplin is eventually able to procure some money from the millionaire in order to pay for the blind girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surgery.\r\n\r\n            While it is not necessary to spoil the ending, it is known as one of the greatest endings in cinema history. It is both telling and romantic, and beautifully simple. Chaplin builds up the energy of the film to the climax at the end, and the result is a perfectly executed story, without the need of sound.\r\n\r\n            Chaplin chose to continue his silent films, and his popularity with audiences around the world was shown by the masses that went to see City Lights. Silent pictures were quickly becoming out-of-date, as Al Jolson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Piano Singer, the first talking picture, was released a few years earlier. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing how Chaplin is able to provide the framework for a story without talking, as well as very few word cards on the screen. \r\n\r\n            The actual acting of Chaplin himself deserves a mention all of its own. Obviously a physical actor, the things he was able to do on screen in City Lights were simply incredible. Chaplin can turn and twist his body like a contortionist into any way he chooses. The result is incredible to behold. His body language is his voice, rendering actual speaking quite unnecessary for the film.\r\n\r\n            Overall, City Lights is recognized as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, silent film of all time, and is one of Chaplin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eternal masterpieces. The tramp character can move fluidly across any film, and the masterful writing and directing in City Lights defines it as a masterpiece of American cinema. The ending really is \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe high point in movies\u00e2\u0080\u009d, James Agee says. The film is the crowning jewel of the silent era, and perhaps eliminated the need to make anymore of them, as simply no one could have topped the work of art that took Chaplin years to create, all himself.",

I'd never seen a Charlie Chaplin flick before, and didn't expect much more beyond some slapstick and physical comedy. What I got, instead, was a story with a whole lot of heart, and the pleasure of watching an amazingly talented man do what he does best: entertain.\n\nThe plot is fairly simple: boy meets girl (who happens to be blind), falls in love with girl, and spends the rest of the movie trying to help her -- rent's due and she and her saintly old grandmother are short, so Chaplin decides to raise the money through various schemes, one of which includes fighting in a boxing ring. I hadn't seen many silent movies before, and I was amazed at how much could be conveyed through limited dialogue. I can certainly see now why Chaplin is considered an icon. His \"Little Tramp\" is just so gosh-darned lovable that you can't help but root for him.\n\nAnd, oh, the ending. I won't say too much, other than that it made me cry. I wasn't the only one within my group who had to surreptitiously wipe tears away! So far, seeing this was one of my best Paramount experiences, and I've been going for years!

Kudos to Chaplin, who is nearly solely responsible for the end product. Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, and starred in \"City Lights\", and his perseverance and strive towards perfection should be duly noticed and recognized. And last, but certainly not least, credit the beautiful Virginia Cherrill, who gives a charming performance as the lead lady. This film needs to be on any serious movie buff's \"must see\" list.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin may not have been as skilled behind the camera as Buster Keaton, but he was funnier, and \"City Lights\" is his best silent film despite being released when talkies were well established (it was shot over the 3 years where talkies were first being introduced). After an opening where everyone else's dialogue in the film has been replaced by some weird quacking noise, everyone's favourite Tramp winds up rescuing a millionaire from suicide who treats him like a real pal when drunk, but when sober he doesn't recognise him. But at the heart of each Chaplin film there's a love interest, and this time it's a blind flower girl who lives with her mother (she senses the Tramp hanging out with the millionaire and thinks he's a millionaire too). After they spend some time together she decides she wants an eye operation to enable her to see again (I'm not sure if that's possible today let alone 80 years ago, but just go with it), but she's a poor lady being threatened with eviction from her landlord, so Chaplin has to take odd jobs to get enough money for his lady.\nThe storyline in Chaplin's films are always second fiddle to his comic routines, and there are some brilliantly memorable ones: A  moment where the Tramp swallows a whistle, saving the millionaire's life multiple times, the eating spaghetti moment and the brilliantly choreographed boxing match (which was rated as one of the best boxing scenes ever by Sports Illustrated). But the reason these comic sequences work so well is not just because they're worked into the storyline to add an extra dimension to them (instead of feeling like a filmed comic routine on a stage), it's that some of them happen quite suddenly regardless of how many similar comic bits you've seen in various other films so they're still unexpected after 80 years, some of them are also inventive on an obvious comedic level, but particularly with the boxing scene, they're so expertly timed and choreographed that it's hard not to laugh. Not every single joke works in the film, but nearly all of them work and nearly all of them are very very funny.\nIf there's one aspect on Chaplin that divides some people, it's his sentimental side that he can let a little too loose on his audience that it can spoil his films, but it would be nigh-on impossible for anyone to dispute how well Chaplin inserted his sentiment into the ending of \"City Lights\", definitely one of the best endings ever for its beautiful simplicity (Jack Lemmon shed tears while discussing how much that ending meant to him). \n\"City Lights\" may not be the most inventive silent comedy (That'll go to \"Sherlock Jr\") but it's definitely one of the funniest and most touching, it's arguably Chaplin's greatest achievement.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin worked on this film for nearly 3 years on this heartwarming romantic comedy, he even managed to resist making it into a talkie when everyone else were making them, and he succeed with near perfection. It has his beloved Little Tramp falling for a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill), who mistakes him for a rich man. Not wanting to disappoint the blind girl, the Tramp decides he will become her benefactor, and cure her of her blindness, and through serendipity, is able to raise the money through the help of a drunken, suicidal millionnaire (Harry Myers). It is a film which really touches the heart, and tickles the funny bone. Chaplin was often accused of letting sentimentality and pathos get in the way of his comedy, but on this occassion, it works. Even in an era where everyone else was making films in full sound, he made a silent-ish movie, (save for a score which Chaplin himself composed) and amusing sound effects. He did the right thing keeping the Little Tramp silent, everyone has their own image of what he sounds like, the minute he talks, the image is shattered. Oh, and the ending is heartbreaking and beautiful.",

His charisma was just so eclectic and fun to watch, everyone seemed to laughing throughout the entire movie.  The part of the leading lady seemed to be actually quite good, especially since she had never done a film before.  The story line was darling and the end was cute.  It's definitely a film someone could fall in love with and decided to watch again and again.  From the drunken night club, to the boxing ring, and even the opening scene on the statue - all work together to make this hilarious film that is definitely worth the watch.",

The best stories are told by action and through visual cues vs. straight out dialogue. Chaplin not only mastered this art of storytelling, but he taps into the soul of the human spirit - the part that brings laughter into our lives. Of course, there were moments when I thought the joke was overplayed or moments when I knew it wasn't relevant to modern day society but those melodramatic parts were reflective of chaplin's genre - a signature style to be sure. What I admired most was his physical flexibility - from getting his pants stuck on a sculpture's sword, to choreographing the drowning and boxing scene, to all the ridiculous dancing and falling. I'm amazed how rubbery he seems! I also believed that Virginia Cherrill's character was truly blind. It's a corny and sweet film but with lots of funny moments.",

            "content": "\"City Lights\" ranks as Charlie Chaplin's greatest silent movie comedy. Ironically, Chaplin produced \"City Lights\" three years after Warner Brothers premiered its quasi-talkie \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927) and revolutionized Hollywood and the film industry. Initially, Chaplin wanted no part of talkies, and he ridicules talkies in the monument dedication scene, though some may argue that he is poking fun at pretentious people. \"City Lights\" is a sweetly sentimental saga about Chaplin's trademark character 'The Tramp' in his tattered evening clothes and a hat who falls hopeless in love with a beautiful but blind flower girl played by Virginia Cherrill.\n\nFeminists may detest the depiction of the heroine was not only blind but also as a passive character that cannot help herself with the aid of the opposite sex. Mind you, the girl is poor as well as humble and believes that the Tramp is actually a millionaire.\n\nMeanwhile, when the Tramp isn't buying flowers from the heroine and escorting her back to where she lives with her grandmother, he strikes up an on-and-off friendship with a real millionaire. According to the credits, mustached Harry Myers of \"Getting Gertie's Garter\" (1927) plays an 'eccentric millionaire.' He is eccentric because he lives alone without his wife and has only his butler to care for him. Unhappy, the millionaire either tries to commit suicide or gets plastered and goes from one party to another, even hosting them at his mansion. The Tramp runs into him late one evening when the Millionaire tries to commit suicide by drowning himself. The Tramp gets soaked for saving his new found friend and the friend reciprocates and becomes the Tramp's long-lost friend\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is\u00e2\u0080\u0094until he sobers up and has no memory of their friendship.\n\nIn any case, the Tramp learns about a treatment that a foreign doctor has used to help some blind people recover their sight and he sets out to earn the money so that the blind girl can see again. The Tramp tries to earn the money the old-fashioned way by joining the ranks as a city sanitation engineer. In other words, he scoops up animal droppings and hauls them away. In one amusing scene, he tries to avoid a street strewn with animals, only to have a couple of circus elephants stomp up out of nowhere. Eventually, he gets fired for being late back to work after his lunch break. Next door, at a gym, he agrees to box for a share of the purse and his opponent agrees to share. Things take a turn for the worse, when the guy has to leave unexpectedly. It seems that the police are after him. The guy who replaces the fleeing boxer is a dour tough guy who is a little afraid of the Tramp's efforts to ingratiate himself to him. Further, the new guy refuses to share the prize money. In one of the funniest scenes ever, we see the Tramp strenuously avoid blows with the rival boxer. The Tramp keeps the referee between them at times or gets behind the other boxer. This confusion is sheer side-splitting fun. Sadly, the Tramp loses, but he keeps trying to get the girl her money.\n\nCharlie Chaplin does a flawless job directing this sappy love story. He alternates his love story with the friendship with the rich man. The way that he meets the blind flower girl is brilliant. The Tramp is walking along when he spots a cop (cops always scare him) and he ducks into a limo parked in the street. When he comes out the door on the other side, he sets foot on the sidewalk in front of the blind girl. The Tramp falls madly in love at first sight and the limo cruises away with the girl believing that she has sold a flower to a wealthy gentleman instead of a homeless transient. There is a pretty funny dance hall number with the Tramp setting fire to a woman's chair and then her dress. However, the crowning achievement of \"City Lights\" is its weepy ending. The Tramp has survived a sentence in stir and he meets the blind girl again, but things are definitely changed. Like the short story about the woman in the arena in Rome, \"City Lights\" asks you to decide for yourself if it has a happy ending or a cynical ending.",

The story of the Tramp and his love for a blind women is one of the great romances of the 20th century, even outside of film, and the humour that Chaplin pulls from this is amazing. It is obvious that Chaplin did not like the introduction of the talkie, this film was made 5 years after [i]The Jazz Singer[/i] and mocks the idea of speaking in a movie in the first scene. However, Chaplin uses music (that he wrote) and sound effects like a whistle and other non diegetic sound to add to his comedy. Chaplin loved using all he could to bring out a laugh but he never saw how dialogue could bring that laughter, and in a way his form of comedy is the purest and most loving. The film proves to anyone with a heart and soul that dialogue is pointless because the Tramp and his love never speak a word on screen and yet every emotion is conveyed with grace and beauty. The last scene is one of such heart and raw emotion that it is hard to fault Chaplin for his reluctance to move to sound, the look the two share is one of the purest and happiest moments I have ever witness on screen and it comes from the purity that Chaplin brings to his films through his grace and his talent.",

This isn't the case, as Chaplin has done better work before (Gold Rush; his best work) and since (Great Dictator, a long monologue away from perfection). But, this is a good movie, and is one of the earliest examples of a spectacular ending. City Lights is better and ages better than the typical silent movie, it can hold its own with romantic comedies of today. Its charming story will keep you entertained, and its ending will leave you breathless, wondering why movies of today don't try to end in the same fashion (or at least with the same amount of effort).

It's interesting to see how much disney short cartoons borrowed from Chaplin though, and the influence it has has on other movies.\n I ended up trying to find where the jokes were supposed to be, and trying to see if the story alone was worth it. For me, it wasn't.",

            "content": "In 1927 Warner Brothers released a sentimental melodrama about a Jewish performer who finds fame by performing in blackface. The basic premise seemed like a 'Birth of a Nation' for the Jazz Age, where black people were mocked and ridiculed in more socially acceptable ways. 'The Jazz Singer' went on to become the biggest box office hit of 1927, and afterwards Hollywood hit a creative low that took almost ten years to recover from. The reason for this massive change? One word: Sound. With 'The Jazz Singer' being the first film to feature synchronised dialogue (and songs!) 1927 was officially the final year of the silent film and the artform died out almost overnight, so eager were the general public to hear people talk to each other instead of having to be informed one sentence at a time via subtitles. Hundreds of silent stars were ruined because of their unwieldly voices or date styles. All except one, the most famous and successful star of them all.\r\nChaplin never liked sound, remarking 'Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?' when learning of 'Warner Brother's supreme triumph.' He was scared also for his own comic style was perfectly suited for the silent era, but now seemed inappriate and awkward in the new craze for speech. So what did he do for his next project? Produce another silent feature length comedy, four years into the sound era. That took guts no one else had ever had, to risk his entire career in the pursuit of his own idea. And, like always, it worked.\r\n'City Lights' is any typical romance, where the hapless Tramp endeavours for a pretty girl's affections. Really, this is little more than an updating of popular comedy plots from 15 years earlier. What ellevates this particular interpretation is its method of execution. Chaplin, ever the creative genius, comes up with more brilliant and hilarious scenarious worked through on his characteristic pratfalling. He uses the world of the 1930s around him in his style so it appears less dated, and subtly utilises sound effects to catch the audience off guard to his supposed Luddism. Then, with intertitles now an old habit for the movie-going public, he uses smaller phrases to convey greater meaning, well-suited to his uniquely poetic verse. But what Chaplin really excels at is his concentration on the actors and introduces a more cinematic approach to his narrative. Many close ups carefully study character faces, mostly the Tramp's, and we feel like we don't need speech from anywhere to tells us what to think or feel about the story. Nowhere is this more evident than in the final scene, a masterpiece of understatement.\r\nWhen the Tramp meets the Girl for the first time with her sight back he is visibly disappointed, but slowly something else forms across his face. The Girl is clearly confused, and then it dawns on her own face who he really is. The Tramp reluctantly makes small talk to hide his staggering humiliation, but the Girl can see it and responds to him with warmth and the implication of friendship. But it's the final shot, the last lingering close up of the Tramp as he intently focuses on her, his finger absent-mindedly stuck between his teeth to make his smile ambiguous, that stirs up a welter of emotions, all of them his favourites: pity, sadness, hope and a sense of relief, still raw come the closing title. \r\nChaplin knew stories like this would never last in the more sophisticated sound era, and consequently made this his final straightforward romance melodrama. Afterwards he used his creativity to inflict scathing social satire on everything he saw 'wrong' with the world. Whether or not the decision to abandon such expertly handled material was both a blessing and a curse, but it was a progression he could'nt escape. He knew perfectly how to remedy that: make 'City Lights' an 80 minute cinematic wonder to remind the world of the simplicity and joy it chose to neglect. That was his ultimate critique of his fickle audience.",

They all are a great viewing experience and deserve a look.\n\nCity Lights, however, may be his finest film overall.  I had  seen enough Chaplin movies to finally read up on a couple of books about the artist: it was in these books that I found out that Chaplin had  shot the ending for 'City Lights' many times over in order to get it right.\n\nMr. Chaplin knew what he wanted and he managed somehow  to truly deliver the goods:  'City Lights' had totally taken my breath away upon first viewing, and even as I watch the film again and again it still leaves me speechless.\n\n*****",

In addition to acting, Chaplin wrote, produced, directed, and scored the film. Chaplin does a fairly decent job in the roles he's given. While this film is a silent film, it was made in the era of talking pictures and from time to time Chaplin makes use of the new technology to bolster the effect of this silent picture.\n\nOf particular importance in this film is the last scene. Often cited as perhaps the greatest scene in any movie, it does not disappoint. Honestly, I was not particularly impressed by the scene at first viewing but I went ahead and rewatched it after reading about it and it is reasonably impressive. I wouldn't say it's the greatest scene I've ever seen, but still rather well done.\n\nWhile I did find this enjoyable, this is neither my favorite silent film (that would be Battleship Potemkin) nor is it my favorite Chaplin film (that remains The Great Dictator), this is still pretty good.

Second, the scenes with Chaplin's love interest (an adorable, blind flower lady) are few and far between, and don't last all that long. So I will just go ahead and call this a great comedy, period -- with a fair dose of romance thrown in. This is certainly one of Chaplin's better movies, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has some of his best and most memorable slapstick antics, and a good story as well. It should also be noted that it was his last silent film, and, having no speaking parts, the fact that this could be considered the best romantic comedy ever is a testament to Chaplin's brilliant acting.

'City Lights' was the first film Chaplin made during the sound era, and whilst he was under pressure to make 'City Lights' as a talkie, he had enough clout to film it as a silent though inventively compromised by inserting sounds, rather than speech. The \"speech\" in the film's opening scenes as a statue is being unveiled (which Chaplin's tramp is sleeping on) was recorded by Chaplin through a comb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribed in the first titles as a \"comedy romance in pantomime\", the film is all this and more, both sentimental and funny. Chaplin's tramp, a clumsy and comical figure who constantly contrives to find himself in farcical circumstances meets a blind girl selling flowers in the street, and she mistakes him for a millionaire (she heard the door of an expensive door slam as he walked by), and that's pretty much the entire narrative. Saving an actual millionaire from drowning (which involves Chaplin almost drowning himself trying to save him), he gets access to that lifestyle, thus making his pursuit of the blind girl a bit more credible - he borrows the millionaires car and gives her a ride. Hilariously though, the millionaire only befriends Chaplin when drunk; when sober he remembers nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon discovering that the girl's family is about to be evicted and also that she could have her sight restored with the right amount of money, Chaplin seems to address both these issues - the millionaire gives him the money but of course when he's sober forgets and assumes Chaplin has robbed him. Although the girl now anonymously has both her problems resolved, Chaplin went to jail. Upon release, he then seeks to find her in a conclusion that is remarkably sentimental by modern standards but is exceptionally moving with a killer final line that would have even the toughest and most cynical amongst us in bits. 'City Lights' is a staggering one man achievement, rightly considered one of the best comedies of all time because it balances the light hearted humour with emotional resonance. The pratfalls and humiliations Chaplin endures have a genuine romantic purpose to them, and the film isn't without it's darker moments, notably when Chaplin is arrested for theft and sent to jail. Plus there's also the issue whether the blind girl who now has her sight will fall in love with a tramp who's not what he appeared/claimed/was assumed to be. 'City Lights' is a comic masterpiece. Superb.",
